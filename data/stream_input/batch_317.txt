B00008YLV2|5.0|This movie disturbed me so much that I had to watch it in stages.  I couldn't sit through it in one session.<br />It is that powerful.<br />Others that complained about the gore and lack of story line--those people need to stick with &quot;nice&quot; war movies like The Fighting SeaBees.  War is violent.  War, often times, lacks a story line.  This movie echoes that.  <br />I was struck by two things.<br />A)  These guys are heroes, each and every one.  They didn't ask to go out, but when called, they selflessly do a job.<BR>B)  They have ABSOLUTELY no idea what they are getting in to when they saddle up and head out.<br />Anyway, this is an excellent movie.  Not for the faint of heart.  Not for the John Wayne-type of war movie crowd.  ESPECIALLY not for younger veiwers.<br />I like this movie.  I just hope that I can sit through the whole thing in one viewing this time.
B00008PC2O|4.0|The Audio commentary prvided by Cameron and Wisher is the highlight of this new DVD edition of T2, which in my opinion is the most exciting, entertaining, and informative special feature of DVDs.  The interactive guide is a nice touch.  In fact, most of the  useful behind the scenes footage from the &quot;Ultimate&quot; edition is contained in the brief interactive segments.  On the other hand, most of the DVD-ROM features are pointless and silly, especially the build your own robot game.  Also, the trailers are not included on this disc, which is annoying.
B00005JLMH|5.0|Why no release of 1492 on DVD from Paramount? This is an excellent film, slightly flawed with historical accuracys, but very solid in all other areas, and a lifelike, almost flawless portrait of Christopher Columbus. Depardieu illustrates Columbus as a man who will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. He wants to prove that Asia can be found to the west, and that the Ocean will not end with monsters guarding the edge of the world like everybody of his time believed it to be, the world is not flat, it's round, and that it also would be an easier trade route for Spain to access the likes of gold, spices, gems, pearls, produce, etc. The film acknowledges that Columbus had no clue, not at first, that he was venturing on a path where no man had ever travelled before. He was entering at least in terms of Earthly travels (not space for mankind), the final frontier. The film compares the discovery of a new world with the landing on the Moon. And it does so in a convincing, lifelike fashion. A very special movie that deserves to be dsicovered on DVD. Paramount has denied film buffs that oppurtunity so far. Hopefully that will all change, two words, release date. The films tagline is - \\"centurys before the exploration of space, there was another voyage into the unknown\\". In the theatrical trailer, a scene where Columbus (Depardieu) jumps off his boat into an alien beachshore, he walks through the saltwater with his arm out as if he wants to touch it with all his strength, he finally made it, than we see his boots, his footsteps and his footprints in the sand being weathered already by the ocean, until he stops and drops to his knees, and finally soaks in the moment. He had just changed the course of history, and mankind. One of the best filmed, most gripping scenes in movie history. At the time, in comparison, this was man landing on the moon for the first time.
1400034779|5.0|What a relief to read a detective story where there are no guns blazing, dead bodies every other page, and a hard-bitten, cynical investigator amongst it all. Mma Ramotswe is a curious woman, the perfect detective for her small town in Botswana. She helps people fix their lives and is good at it, making for heartwarming, often funny reading. If you want angst-free reading and a good story to boot, have a peek into Mma Ramotswe's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency.
B000066NW0|5.0|It's impressive that Avril Lavigne writes her own songs.  At first glance, she appears to be a pretty girl with a spunky attitude and unique image that some record company wanted to use to sell albums.  But her talent is for real.  Just listen to the songs on &quot;Let Go&quot; and you'll soon realize she isn't your typical teen pop star.  While some of the songs are pure pop, others are clearly rock-influenced, and even the pure pop songs are very catchy and melodic.  From hook-heavy songs like &quot;Mobile&quot; to rockin tracks such as &quot;Unwanted&quot; and &quot;Sk8er Boi&quot;, this album soars above the rest.
0679777547|4.0|Unlike the film, &quot;The Ninth Gate&quot;, this is a detective story, not a supernatural thriller.  I suspect that Roman Polanski's horror movie may have turned away potential readers from this finely crafted book.<br />As most reviewers have written, the character of Lucas Corso is well-developed.  Unfortunately, that cannot be said of most of the other characters, who remain relatively flat to the end of the story.  This is particularly disappointing in the case of Irene Adler.<br />On the other hand, there is much revealed of the characters through dialog.  One quickly appreicates the unscrupulousness of the book restorers visited by Corso as he discusses with them how a book might be 'perfected' during restoration.<br />Although some reviewers are put off by the literary and historical references, without them this books would lack a basis for understanding the two literary mysteries Corso seeks to solve, and why he begins to think they are interrelated.  Actually it is not necessary to follow all the literary illusions to understand the plot or the central mysteries.  These references mainly just add to the mood that this is an intellectual puzzle as well as a whodunit.  They are largely intellectual wallpaper.<br />The few literary and technical facts that one really does require to understand this book are conveniently explained by the author, although that may occur several chapters down the line.  Just be patient!<br />Finally, despite the comparisons to the work of Umberto Eco, I wouldn't place Perez-Reverte's novels in the same league.  Perez-Reverte's books are written to be accessible and entertaining, not deeply philosophical, and in this he succeeds.
B00005JLPK|5.0|This is such a GREAT MOVIE! Do not pay attention to Mexican reviewers with bad intentions, It is incredible how envious is the Mexican people; they can't bear the fact that an actress from their own country succeeded in a great project of her own... shame on you Mexico. The movie is just incredible, the visual concept, the costumes, the performances, the music, the whole movie is full with passion! I highly recommend it. I'm not fond of Frida's paintings, but this is a movie, a great one, and I was so amazed when I first saw it. It's the product of so much hard work from Salma and her team. I specially enjoyed the part of the little skeleton doctors, animated by stop-motion at the hospital scene. Those are typical handcrafts in Mexico, and it was a very interesting detail on the movie.  By the way, I'm Mexican.
0380789035|4.0|A truly interesting read.  Neil spins a rollicking, twist filled adventure tale full of colorful character.  Wednesday alone is a reason to read the book.  A good story.  Great entertainment; however while this book spins a great yarn and fascinating history, it does not present its characters with as many levels of complexity as say, Neil's Sandman works.  The characters are interesting and not mere black and white, but the they firmly stick in their allotted shade of grey without shifting much.  Still, the plotting is near perfect.  Recommended.
B00005J6T1|4.0|Twenty years later, the girl is still doing her thing. \\"Madonna\\" the album is interesting today primarily because we've all seen what happened to this sexy little street waif with tangled hair and an overabundance of rubber bracelets and crucifixes. I daresay nobody saw it coming back in 1983. She was by no means an overnight success; as has proven her forte time and time again in the intervening years, she basically willed this more or less mediocre debut album to succeed on the pure power of her personality. Before people knew who Madonna was, before they could put a face to the name, nobody really cared about \\"Everybody\\" or \\"Holiday,\\" which as songs are virtually indistinguishable from hundreds of other bland post-disco tracks of the era. She built her initial fan base in the clubs, where people saw her lip-sync in the flesh. Because what Madonna has always had going for her is charisma. Watch her early videos and the songs come alive. When she winks at you over her shoulder in \\"Lucky Star,\\" or writhes around on the ground like a vixen-victim in \\"Burning Up,\\" it's hard not to fall for her, even though her voice has all the range of a penny-whistle. Her talent is her persona.<br />Of the mere 8 songs included on \\"Madonna,\\" 5 were relative hits: \\"Lucky Star,\\" \\"Borderline,\\" \\"Holiday,\\" \\"Burning Up,\\" and \\"Everybody.\\" \\"Burning Up\\" is probably my favorite on this album. I'm sure her voice was thoroughly processed, but I think she sounds better here than she ever has subsequently. She comes across as strong and confident with a lot of attitude. Compared with future embarrassments like \\"Erotica,\\" whose often pretentious, sexually cheesy or just plain harebrained approach to lyricism and song construction leaves one cold, or the \\"Evita\\" soundtrack, in which you can practically hear the vocal coach, these early attempts are much more compelling. This is the girl who wanted to \\"conquer the world,\\" as she famously told Dick Clark on American Bandstand. And amazingly enough, she pulled it off.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Matrix is more real than we think.  We are in short symbiotic creatures created by a higher being programmed to do one thing: to live and better ourselves to become divine-like beings. That is the purpose that we are exist in this earthly world. Just think about it for one second...Without purpose, we are just some mindless people that are roaming the earth to comsume up natural resources and enjoy our lives out meaninglessly.  This very meaning, if think through thoroughly, can help us understand our existence.  The Matrix is truly a masterpiece putting together to teach us one thing.  The world is not shallow and one dimension.  That our existence has a purpose that allows us to elevate to another higher dimension if we understand what life is all about. It is our decision to choose how to live it because we have free will.  But when you realize what you can capable of become, you can be on higher level than everyone else and that makes you become the &quot;One&quot; -an anomaly.  This then will help you see what many others can't see.  They can only perceive through you but not what's in you. Take knowledge for example.  People say, I quote, &quot;Knowledge is power!&quot; Power of self. Power of devine. Power of greatness.
0440224764|3.0|I must say that there are no heroes here.  Grisham's earlier books featured clean-cut individuals placed in awkward positions that required difficult decisions and great effort to resolve.  By contrast, in this story everyone around has an ethical blindness regards theft and covetousness.  Somehow, none of the main characters seems to think that taking fraudulently obtained money is wrong.<br />That said, Grisham has finally begun to write novels that end as well as they begin.  Many of his earlier books featured heroes and heroines predictably flying off to a fabulous future with vast sums of money at their disposal.  This one has a much better-crafted ending that makes it worthwhile reading it to the end.

0792839129|3.0|This movie is ok family fun. I remember seeing this movie in the Saturday matinee theatre in the sixties when I use to live in New York. Leonard Maltin says the score is forgettable. The songs are annoying, except for the oscar nominated title song. The characters are annoying, especially the King who thinks he is still a child.<br />The Movie is about a flying car taken from a story written by Ian (Bond, James Bond) Flemming. In movie The father, played by the very talented Dick Van Dyke, Tells a story about Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. The father and children become characters in the story. The children are captured and forced to work as slaves. In this country no children are aloud. The country is ruled by a tyrranical King who forces a local toy maker, Played by the great British comedian Benny Hill, to make toys just for him. The father and his friend Truly Scruptious try to recue the children.<br />The story is not all that good but many people growing up in the sixties my enjoy it because it brings back memories. The cinemotography is quite good. And any movie with Dick VAn Dyke in it cannot be all that bad.
B00006SFBD|5.0|First of all, I have discovored Opeth by some kind of miracle,the same as I found Tool and Iced Earth; on a whim. I saw Deliverance and had heard a little about the band, but never really listened to any of there stuff, so I decided to pick it up. Best thing I've ever done since buying nima at first glance. Despite Mikael Akerfeldt death metal growling, which I am not overly fond of, Opeth is NOT death metal. They are much more than that, nearly rivaling Tool in listening pleasure. The varied riffs, solo's acoustic guitar, and the varying vocals from Akerfeldt keep the music from getting repetitive and boring during the songs, which average about 10 minutes. This is one of the greatest buys I have ever made, and I will be enjoying it for a long time. LONG LIVE REAL METAL
B00004ZD69|5.0|After listening to Godspeed's first two releases, I got the feeling that they were working towards something absolutely amazing.  To say I was right is an understatement.<br />Skinny fists is a dramatic improvement from their first two records, even though they still sound incredible after many repeated listenings.  The sad parts are sadder, the optimistic parts make you feel ten feet tall.  There is a lot of music on this two-disc set, but I've never felt like it ran too long.  The different movements flow together perfectly...slowly easing you into one piece, and then slowly evolving into another.  The record ends before you realize it. <br />The composed movements here are the best of their first three records.  They're much more powerful and should be able to at the very least create some goosebumps on your arms, if not make you want to cry.  There are also some wonderful bits of droning ambience that are similar to their first record that provide great transitions from one movement to the next.<br />Needless to say, if you have a short attention span, this music isn't for you.  However, if you like their first two releases, you will be blown away.  This release is one of the first classics for the new millennium.
0671027387|2.0|I read this book because 'The Da Vinci Code' wasn't available at my library and I wanted to read something by this author.  The book was okay...but not great.  The plot moved along almost too quickly, with everything happening just in the nick of time.  I didn't like the numerous short chapters, and there was too much foreshadowing for my liking.  The plot was too far-fetched and I was actually happy to finish the book!
B00008PC2O|4.0|&quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot; needs no explanation, so let's skip to the &quot;Extreme Edition&quot; attributes-<br />Video/Audio<br />By far, one of the best-looking DVD videos that I've seen to date.  Crystal-clarity that is even an improvement over the previous &quot;Ultimate Edition.&quot;  Audio is nothing spectacular, but still great.<BR>New &quot;never-before-seen&quot; footage is included in the movie.  If you want to see the old theatrical version though, here's how: On Disc One, highlight &quot;Sensory Control&quot; and press RIGHT 5 times.  You'll be given the option to play the Theatrical version.<br />Special Features<br />On Disc One, you can find a very good commentary with the Director, James Cameron.<BR>On Disc Two, there are 2 &quot;featurettes&quot;-  <BR>The first is &quot;No Feat But What We Make&quot; which is a wonderful documentary detailing the development of the visual effects (most notably, the groundbreaking CGI) in the film.<BR>The second is &quot;T2: On the Set&quot; which is a more or less interesting look at life on and around the production of the movie.<BR>Included on this disc (for DVD-ROM owners) is a new &quot;high defintion&quot; Theatrical version of the movie playable on Windows Media Player.  In order to even play it though, your PC is going to need a LOT of horsepower.<BR>Some other DVD-ROM features include some Terminator &quot;morphing&quot; games for portraits and another game where you can create a Skynet Combat Chassis.<br />The packaging is nice too.
0060934913|3.0|Although there were interesting anecdotes, the book was mostly fluff. I was hoping it would get more interesting, but it didn't.  This book is good if you are thinking about becoming a chef or want to know more about the industry, but there is no real point to the book.
B00005JLWN|4.0|Did you like the Matrix but feel it had just too much loopiness in it's plotline? <br />Did you like the book Brave New World, but felt at times it lacked a modernistic approach to action?<br />Did you ever wish to see those two stories in one.<br />Okay this movie has that kind of feel. It's basically saying in the Early years of the 21st Century, WWIII happened. Since then the world joined together(what remained of it) and created a society where emotions were outlawed because it was believed that emotions cause war.  These emotional criminals are monitored and eraticated by these Gestapo type policemen called Clerics.  <BR> <BR> So it's like BNW in that it's a society hellbent on one ideal. (BNW=Youth alone EQ=No Emotion) and then one Cleric learns what it is to feel and tries to work his way through it all.  While there's some incredible fight scenes (no CGI or Wires mind you. Just pure crazy choreography) it's also got a great deal of feeling to it without all the crypticism of the Matrix.<br />Christian Bale provides an amazing portrayal of innocence through naivity. And while Taye Diggs belied his part by smirking far too much for an emotionless Cleric, he did play a natural bad guy 'just doing his job.'<br />All in all despite a fairly basic plotline, and Taye Diggs minor slip ups, this movie provides all that was lacking in Matrix and more. <br />Tired of Wire Fighting and CGI taking over the job of great choreography blended with great acting? Look no further than Equilibrium.
B000063DI9|5.0|Believe it or not Iron Maiden came up with a \\"pretty\\" album. Not to sound like they don't rock but, this is by far the \\"slowest\\" album they have ever had. By slow i mean that everything is not just screaming and hard guitars. Everything in this album fits together, there are no real differences between the songs. Nothing major anyways. However this Maiden album is the best as a whole album that they ever made. But my favorite songs actually are on the Somewhere in Time album. Overall this is a definite must have!!! If you are just scared of the Iron Maiden Eddie covers thinking they are too hard for you, pick up this album......I guarantee you change your mind and you become a DIE HARD FAN.<BR>10 stars out of 5.
0451207521|2.0|Ken Follet is usually a great writer.  Not this time.  His strength is strong interesting characters that you come to care about.  Not this time.  The first half of the book is mostly page-filler.  The second half, the action half, has a weak plot that he supplements with detail about torture.<BR>If you want a great Follet read on WW II, try The Key to Rebecca or other earlier works.
0393057658|3.0|A fair read, amd written well because of special access to the A's while they were winning 20 in a row, but Lewis' soujourn into baseball seems contrived, as if Thomas Boswell or Roger Kahn spent a while writing about all-star mutual fund managers. I enjoyed it, but I really got such a rush from Lewis' other works that I hope he goes back to where he really stands out. Dozens of sportswriters could have done this book, maybe with a little less style, but done it nonetheless.
B00006JJ1O|2.0|Tatu will never appear on the cover's of the pop magazines like Justin Timberlake and Avril lavigne did when they succeeded on their first albums.Tatu are just obnoxious with their songs and music.The lyrics to the songs are constantly repeated and they look like their everywhere when you look at them by analyzing. Those background laughs in ''30 minutes'' are annoying and know this none of Tatu's videos appeared on muchmore music but Avril lavigne's did.It's easy to explain how come ''not gonna get us now'' didn't make it on the countdown which pop videos usually do because it wasn't popular and not very good. It looks embarassing when the British banned a Tatu video and not letting Julia into a Mcdonalds.It just looks so phony that these girls are homosexual and they probably aren't...they probably do what their manager told them what to do. Tatu are shams and you should feel ashamed by wasting your money on this disgraceful exploitation of a Europop album.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I think Christina is so talented as a vocalist. And she got more soul on this album than her debut. I just couldn't stand listening through the whole album because she is soooooo serious. Like there is no fun in here. I could hear one song at a time like on the radio or something, but entire album made me wanna puke. She just over sings a lot. Next time around I hope she relaxes a little.
0684171600|4.0|\\"Treasure Island,\\" written by the 19th century novelist, Robert Louis Stevenson, is the timeless story about life on the high seas with pirates, treasure, murder, and treachery.<br />When young and naive Jim Hawkins is given a treasure map from the mysterious old pirate, Billy Bones, adventure and trouble are not far behind. Soon Jim finds himself aboard a ship with a villainous crew led by the cunning and mendacious pirate, Long John Silver. Greed and the lust for gold driving the pirates, they have murder in mind when they reach the dubious Treasure Island.<br />Skillfully yet simply written, Robert Louis Stevenson gives us an alluring tale that sparks the imagination. With its dastardly plot and mothly crew of rogues and villains, it entrances the reader, and keeps them wanting more. \\"Treausure Island\\" is the perfect read for anyone just wanting a good, exciting story.
B000002H33|5.0|THIS ALBUM EVERY SONG IS GOOD MY FAVORITE IS WELCOME HOME SANITARIUM ITS A REALLY GOOD TRACK JJUST LIKE BATTERY AND MASTER OF PUPPETS .THIS ALBUM IS AWSOME
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Yes, there are some songs that they could have left off this CD. But that's what the skip button on your CD player is for! Without Christine McVie, the CD does feel like a pieced together combination of Linsey and Stevie's solo albums. Who knew that Christine was the &quot;glue&quot; in this band. But I just love so many of the songs on this CD, especially &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;, &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot;...oh, there are so many! <br />I just saw Mac live in DC and they were awesome, as usual! Don't miss them in concert. They sound amazing LIVE. They do many of the old favorites and classics, plus most of the best songs from &quot;Say You Will&quot;. So buy this CD and go to the show. You won't regret it.
B00008S2VH|5.0|This is good! It grows on you. The kind of album that you can listen in your car while singing along the lines.And that is how I judge a good album, when u can listen to it, again and again....like her previous albums or Norah Jones, Josh Groban,Toni Braxton's Unreak my Heart Album....etc. You can't compare these albums to 50 Cents' or Eminem or even Christina's. Because they are of different genre of interest. Where have all the great no.1 songs of the 80s and early 90's gone too. To the dumps with likes such as 50 cents??? Nobody knew Norah until her Grammy sweep, and I was listening and playing to her song all the time. Nobody cared then.<br />When the first time I heard it I was shocked at the minimalism of this Madonna album. Especially the guitars. But the second time I heard it, you want to be part of the hoo hahs. 'Nobody knows me' is an intelligently composed dance track, I dont think Christina can come up with. Hollywood is an innovation in its musical arrangement. Has anyone heard a new style where Madonna's voice grows into a masculine voice at the ending? No one has done that before, and its gonna be a new trend soon, mark my words. Just like she made electronic music with catchy tunes trendy from her Ray of Light album. Then followed by Kylie...Cher....etc....<br />Watching her perform at MTV live Times Square, u know this is a blast. No one had performed a dance/electronic song so watchable and almost acoustically. Nothing Fails, with the Gospel-like choir reminds you of Like a Prayer, and its nothing short of its awe and spirit too. Nothing Fails, no more fear...and the lyrics just make your day.<br />Go back and listen again without prejudice. The album is honest and nothing about the cliche You are beautiful...and no one can put u down kinda thing.<br />Dance to it, move by it and rock with it! Its not just American Life...it is to Live Life!
B00005YXZH|5.0|So I read the whole story about this small band from Chicago beating the big bad record industry beast with 5 heads, and then I thought &quot;They've got to be another over-hyped band that the critics defend thoroughly&quot;.  <BR>Okay, I had to order this CD because they don't carry it in my local Mexican Mega Record shop.  Wow my curiosity was awoken.  After a few weeks of waiting for it, I finally got to here it.  <BR>I was blasted away by how good this album actually is.  The songs are a la Flaming Lips meets Radiohead meets some country music I've never heard. I loved it.  I play it constantly.  It's a staple in my 5 disc carrousel.  It replaced The Flaming Lips' Yoshimi CD.
0440237688|5.0|The book The Giver was a very good book.  Although it had many unanswered questions, I thought that it was interesting trying to think of what could have happened.  I also liked the fact that they kept on going back to the beginning of the book and connected everything together to make it a great story.  <br />Lois Lowry is a great author, and it is proven through this book.  She puts in the story a couple little lesons that could relate to an everyday situation even though this story obviously takes place in the future.<br />Overall this book is superb.  I could not put this book down, and it is a short read too.  So it can be read in a day.

B00006J3WH|5.0|I loved the episode \\"Once More, With Feeling\\" and when the soundtrack came out I rushed right out to get it!!! \\"once More, With Feeling\\" is on of my all time FAVORITE Buffy episodes. I recomend this to Everyone. On track number 2 when Anya sings her \\"Bunnies\\" song I laughed untill I almost cried then I did cry when I heard the gangs emotional song \\"If We're Together\\" it is sad. All in all this is a great CD for any Buffy or Musical fan!!
B00008PX8P|5.0|Being a Led Zep fan of 20 years (note that I am 26 years old), I was too young to see Led Zep live.  With &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; and the BBC sessions CDs as my only live examples, the DVD and 3 CD set will curb my hunger for now.<br />PROS:<BR>Rediscover that Led Zep is rooted in old school rhythm and blues.  Every rendition of each song is different.  These guys weren't happy with doing anything the same twice.<br />Realize that the band is having so much fun with each other than putting on an act or show for the fans.  So many bands these days write music just to get people to buy records while Led Zep kept true to what inspires them in spite of what everyone wanted to hear.<br />CONS:<BR>I don't know if this was done on purpose, but the video footage doesn't give John Paul Jones any justice.  Many times you see the back of his head or nothing of him whatsoever.  Just Bonzo, Page, and Plant.  Jones kept a low key image in the band, but was the foundation of their sound...the glue that kept things together.<br />Wished they had less popular songs such as The Lemon Song or South Bound Suarez.<br />Want more interviews please!<br />Ok, thanks for reading!
B00009APK1|5.0|My review is based on the cinema version so my view are strictly about the film. I suppose I have an \\"advantage\\" in that I haven't read the books ...yet. Therefore no \\"disappointment\\" as some of the Tolkien purists seem have experienced.  I have the book set sitting on my shelf at home as they have been for years waiting for me to read them someday. Having read some of the other reviews I think I'll wait until the film of \\"Return Of the King\\" is released later in the year before I pick up the books or maybe I'll just read to \\"Two Towers\\". With my reading track record it'll probably take me that long anyway!<BR>I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Two Towers\\". The second film in any trilogy is the hardest to make as it's a linking film. The \\"Star Wars\\" series & Prequels are a good example of that.  But \\"Two Towers\\" is big in quality especially the acting from the lead characters. It's a long perilous journey that we take with Frodo and company and we're right there with them during their highs and lows thanks to some superd camera work. (I look forward to the extended DVD set as I am currently enjoying the FOTR 4 disc version). A huge standard has been set by the making of these films and I expect  no less from \\"Return\\" when released. It's a benchmark that will be hard to top in future. If you are a Tolkien purist it might be hard to divorce yourself from the book/film comparisons. But one should enjoy the films for what they are...majestic and glorious in their presentation, wonderful to watch with the family. I found watching FOTR on DVD to be more rewarding as there were things that I missed the first time around that were better explained on second or third viewing. Two Towers is no less a masterpiece and it will be wonderful on DVD when released. If the packaging & presentation of the extended version in November is anything like FOTR then I'll await it with much anticipation.
B00000JMQE|5.0|I first saw this film when I was about 5 years old (1987) and from that first viewing I was hooked.  The film haunted me until I saw it again in the early 1990's.  The tale is one of an Oz that Dorothy would never have survived in. An Oz that is only an eerie shell of what it once was.  It was truly a modern day retelling of the land of Oz. I strongly recommend this movie to anyone whether or not they've seen the first Wizard of Oz; this film can stand on it's own.
B00000K19E|4.0|THE MATRIX is the most popular film to come out in recent years and definitely the best since 1995's CASINO. It is the creation of The Wachowski Brothers who were, until this film, basically unheard of. That's changed a lot with this sci-fi/action/thriller masterpiece. <br />THE MATRIX stars Keanu Reeves as Thomas Anderson, known to the computer world as Neo, a young computer hijacker who continues to receive messages on his computer from an unknown person involving a thing called 'The Matrix'. From there Neo is swept away from what we call reality - which turns out to be a computer-generated world created to keep us happy. What we think of as 1999 is actually closer to 2199 - and out of the \\"perfect world\\", it shows. The skies are black, the ground a desert, our cities crumbling (hmmm...sound familiar, i.e. THE TERMINATOR?) - and the world run by machines who create humans in fields.<br />Woah.<br />From the flawless special effects, the great cast, the action-packed screenplay, the commendable directing and the perfect choreography by martial arts master director Yuen Wo Ping, THE MATRIX is a non-stop thrill ride that is almost flawless. I should definitely recommend THE MATRIX to anyone looking for a good time.<br />OVERALL: 4.5 [Masterpiece] out of 5 [Perfect]
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is hands down, one of the greatest CDs ever created.  I had high expectations for Meteora after Hybrid Theory was released, and I'm happy to report that Meteora matches, and even exceeds my expectations.  Linkin Park is one of those groups that appeal to so many people.  If you are a fan of, rap, rock, or techno, you'll probably like Linkin Park.  They mix all three genres into one new, kick [rear-end] genre!  Like all great artists, Linkin Park has it's critics.  But despite their criticism, they have a huge fan base, and for a good reason.  My only problem with the album is that it's a short one.  However, I go by the \\"quality not quantity\\" theory on this one.  And quality is delivered and thus the album is easily worth purchase.
B00008RWC2|5.0|This book is awesome. For someone that never knew if they were doing something right or not, NOW I KNOW. The pictures are amazing and the instructions are REALLY easy. The author is very talented and it is a great addition to my library!
B00008G9JO|1.0|I doubt many of those who profess to enjoy this record really do. I think they only admire its chains of dangling participles, its overwrought adolescent pseudo-poetry. They are impressed by such obscurities of diction as &quot;night-light ride&quot; and &quot;butterfly-stroking on a spring-tide high&quot;. <br />Or maybe they find Ian Anderson's chanting &quot;and the mouse police never sleeps&quot; unaccompanied at the end of the song of this title...um, cute. I find it obnoxious--not even cloying, just obnoxious. In any case, since there is so very little music in the rest of the song, the contrast is not striking.<br />The back cover photograph of the group members in tuxedos brandishing wine glasses, by the bye, puts me in mind of another seventies rock record: Procol Harum's &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;. Now THERE is a record with incisive lyrics and harmonic originality and sophistication (relatively speaking--within a rock context, that is), wit, and good humor. It too includes a song about a mouse--a cartoon mouse, to be sure, but if we're to allow weathercocks in our menagerie, I think we have to allow cartoon mice as well. &quot;TV's Caesar, Mighty Mouse&quot; is much more clever than either &quot;The Mouse Police Never Sleeps&quot; (&quot;little furry folk&quot;, indeed) or &quot;One Brown Mouse&quot;. (If you're still wondering, Mr. Anderson, the answer is that in the history of rodentry NO mouse has EVER &quot;really [cared] for&quot; ANY human.)<br />Or if you're willing to venture outside rock, truly masterful lyric-writing and harmonic sophistication are attained by Stephen Sondheim on his &quot;A Little Night Music&quot;. <br />Whoops! Back to rock: Note please that disliking &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; doesn't make you a &quot;Tull hater&quot;. At worst it makes you a (more euphonious) &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; hater. Precisely, it makes you a &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; disliker. Okay?
B00008OWZC|5.0|A new Icon is born.  What more can be said?  No band - past, present, or in the future - has equaled or will be able to equal the genius and greatness of Led Zeppelin!  Page, Plant, Jones, and Bonham.  Just their names alone bring smiles to the rock and roll cognoscenti.  To be able to play with and off of each other the way they did, showcased in these two shows, is nothing short of spectacular.  &quot;The Song Remains The Same&quot; is nothing but a pretender to the throne.  Throw it away and replace it with &quot;How The West Was Won.&quot;  You will then know why this band truly ruled in its day.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I have not heard a better CD (except for some older bands like Chicago and Eagles) in a long while. The songs have everything I like mixed in there and it just sounds so wonderful. My favourite songs to date are Somewhere I Belong, Lying From You, Easier To Run, Faint, Numb, From The Inside, and Breaking A Habit. They're so wonderful and they inspire the hell out of me to write stories. Chester's voice is once again a huge plus to this album along with everything else that's good. Hehe, it literally took my breath away and people started asking me why I stopped breathing...I couldn't have asked for a better birthday present. The Japanese flute (that's what it is...right?) used in Nobody's Listening is quite a nice touch, in my opinion.<br />If you want a CD that keeps you interested and entertained after you've listened to it everyday for the past two months, then I whole-heartedly recommend this CD. I really have nothing bad to say about it.
0385504209|4.0|Let me start with a disclaimer, I'm fascinated by stories that involve the Vatican and the power of the Catholic church.  As a Catholic in the United States, I'm intrigued by the vast monetary and property holdings that the church possesses worldwide, as well as the loyalty that the church has inspired.  As an institution, you know that the Catholic church has the power to survive many scandals and crises.<br />So, if the premise of the Da Vinci code is the search for information so powerful that it has the power to reduce the mighty Vatican strucutre to rubble, I'm hooked.  Mr. Brown does a nice job of framing a thriller with monks and bishops serving as the &quot;bad guys,&quot; even though they're trying to preserve a religion.<br />My only problem with this book is the &quot;gotcha&quot; factor.  I won't give away any of the secrets, but I was annoyed by the fact that every puzzle and mystery in the book was solved by the prime characters within a few pages in some form of dazzling revelation.  If the mysteries remained buried for almost two millenium, you'd think it would take more than 36 hours for the main characters to get to the bottom of them.  Mr. Brown gets an &quot;A&quot; for his idea and a &quot;B-&quot; for the execution.
B00008G9JM|1.0|First: My one star rating is for T-H-I-S V-E-R-S-I-O-N O-N-L-Y. FIVE STARS for both the vinyl disc and the original laser disc. As for:<br />&gt;All I ever hear from other reviewers is all about how if they liked it, they could have done without the Story of the Hair, because it's just too silly, or pointless, or whatever. For goodness sake, people! It's a humorous interlude. It's supposed to be funny and silly as all get out! So try renting a sense of humor for a day, then listen to it. <br />It's supposed to be silly. It is silly; it's not hilarious. Look: What we object to, at least what *I* object to, is having to hear &quot;the story&quot;--talking, lots of talking--EVERY SINGLE TIME I put time I put on &quot;A Passion Play&quot;. (If you're determined to muck about with this recording ANY WAY, Mr. Anderson, why not assign &quot;the story&quot; to a separate disc? THAT would be a &quot;bonus&quot;.)<br />As for Tull's post-1973 recordings: We have gathered here today to assess &quot;A Passion Play&quot;. &quot;A Passion Play&quot;, at least in its original form, is getting nearly uniform RAVE reviews here. What more could you reasonably expect? (I have continually to remind myself that &quot;fan&quot; is short for &quot;fanatic&quot;.)
B00006X06U|1.0|As a fan returning to Joni Mitchell after a long time away, I was looking for what amounted to a greatest hits type of album.  Not being aware of &quot;Both Sides Now&quot;, I was caught unaware when I played the album.  This is not the same singer (figuratively) who sang &quot;Yellow Taxi&quot; thirty or more years ago.  In comparison, this album is over orchistrated and overdone.  At times, you can barely hear Joni singing over the orchestra.  Folk music doesn't take well to symphony orchestras.  I was very disappointed.  PLB
B000002JSP|5.0|I was 14 when this album came out and turned the grooves to dust within a few months by ceaselessly playing it on a cheap Soundesign turntable. Then I got in on 8-track. In 1983, I bought the casette (newly installed in my car), and in 1998, I finally broke down and got it on CD. When you buy an album *four* times, you know it's a keeper.<br />This is a fitting denouement for the Greatest Rock Band Ever, though I wish John Bonham drank a little less and lived a little longer. His touch is all over these songs. His genius was that he made the drum riffs sound easy. It's deceptive -- you try some of those bits while never dropping the on-tempo beat from the high-hat. <br />\\"In Through the Out Door\\" also showcases John Paul Jones' layering-on of the keyboard and synthesizer parts over his driving bass. My favourite is his upbeat boogie-woogie piano on \\"South Bound Suarez.\\"<br />Robert Plant still had most of his voice when this was recorded, and it really comes out best on this remastered CD version. The album's opening tune, \\"In the Evening,\\" sends the listener back not to 1979 (when this record was released), but to 1973. The sound and leitmotifs are right out of \\"Houses of the Holy\\" songs \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Dancing Days.\\" Jimmy Page's guitar solo is quintessential Pagey; There's no guitarist who can touch him. Hendrix, Clapton, Nugent, Van Halen, they come close, but you listen to Page, scratch your head and ask \\"how'd he do that?\\"<br />\\"Fool in the Rain\\" is the best song on this record. It's a song only Zeppelin could do: Part Reggae, part meringue, part Carnaval in Rio, laid over with Page's Steely Dan-like solo, it's still all Zeppelin. Plant's voice soars on this one.<br />\\"Hot Dog\\": Country Western, sure. Rockabilly, yeah. What I really hear is Plant's tribute to Elvis. When his voice wavers and quavers, the King comes through. Plant doesn't say \\"hunka hunka,\\" but you can hear it between the lines.<br />Yes, I forgive them for \\"Carouselambra.\\" Too much synth. However, excellent bass and guitar lines and it's all over the map in its musical construction.<br />\\"All My Love\\": At the time, a fave at high school dances, but it was really Plant's tribute to his son, who'd died tragically. How eerily it seems written for Bonzo as well.....<br />\\"I'm Gonna Crawl.\\" This is Led Zep blues, right out of \\"In My Time of Dying\\" and \\"What Is and What Should Never Be.\\" It's gut wrenching, slow, a dirge.<br />\\"Zoso\\" is still their best, but this is the one I get all sentimental about. I listen to it, and I'm 14 again.
B000002UDB|4.0|At first impression, this Beatle recording is devoid of many rock n roll elements.  Where are the guitars?  And oh so many brass and string arrangments.<br />However, what stands out the most are the melodies. Most of them are extremely catchy. This certainly overrides the lack of a good guitar/bass presence.  Really its just a minor beef when you are dealing with Lennon and McCartney.<br />Anyway, Strawberry Fields Forever is one of John's most reverred songs at least to my ears.  The delightful arrangement and keyboard tones just take me to a delightful other world.<br />And Penny Lane is such a cheery bouncy tune that it warms your soul with its presence.  Paul's vocal accents are oh so charming.<br />Outside of those two standout tunes, the lighweight Your Mother Should Know has a pleasing sing a long appeal and steady drumming.  I Am The Walrus is another one of Lennon's trippy gems.  And simple was never so effective in the album closer, All You Need Is Love.<br />A few little drawbacks.  Flying is a nothing special instrumental interlude.  Blue Jay Way gets pretty tiresome fast.  And The Magical Mystery Tour sure could have been stretched out a little more both lyrically and with the piano jam at the end.  However, there are plenty of good tunes on here for a four star rating.
B000065U1N|5.0|When you hear the so called experts talking about the &quot;New Urban Combat&quot; type of wars that will be fought, this was what they meant. This movie is not for the faint of heart, it shows what war is all about; it's dirty, bloody, and awful! This movie is as close to the real thing as you'll ever want to get.
B000066C1N|4.0|Did you like the Movie ' Spirit: Stallion Of the Cimarron'?<BR>Well if you liked the songs and themes of Spirit you'll love this beautiful soundtrack.
0688014291|2.0|Don't bother with this book that offers essentially one tip for dealing with all management challenges.  Maybe that's all you can fit into one minute ...
B000002J1M|3.0|Again I am reviewing a Genesis recording from the early days when Peter Gabriel was the lead vocalist and Phil Collins was merely a steady drummer and a talented second vocalist.<br /><br />This Foxtrot release is no mere collection of songs.  Its more like  a series of progressive symphonies.  No doubt about it that each of the six collections contains some stunning instrumental colorings.  Tony Banks adds so many compelling keyboard touches most notably on Watcher of The Skies, Time Table, and the epic Supper's Ready.  Steve Hackett contributes a beautiful guitar passage entitled Horizons.  Too bad it could not be extended a little longer.  Peter Gabriel adds much personality to all of the songs.<br /><br />All good instrumental touches aside, the major drawback on Foxtrot is the hit and miss quality of the melodies.  I've played through this CD a few times now and there are several moments throughout this recording where several of the sections of many of the songs are just not too memorable.  Get 'Em Out By Friday just jumps all over the place in its eight and half minute running time.  Supper's Ready certainly has several captivating moments but also contains some noteworthy dead space.  Can Utility And The Coastliners also has some forgettable moments particularly around some of the early vocal parts.<br /><br />After further conclusion, a three and a half star rating seems appropriate.

079075116X|4.0|Clint Eastwood hasn't done too many military or spy movies, and it was fun to seem him tackle the genre.  Clint plays an ex-Air Force fighter pilot named Mitchell Gant who had some bad experiences in Vietnam and is enjoying his retirement on a ranch.  He is recruited by a international espionage ring who already have a top-secret mission ready for him.  He is to sneak into the Soviet Union and with the help of persecuted Russian Jews, steal the Soviet's newest and scariest fighter jet, the MIG-31, codenamed \\"Firefox\\".  But the KGB is on his tail from minute one, only they don't know yet exactly why he is there.  All heck breaks loose once they find out why, but it's too late.  Gant is up in the air at the controls of the plane and it's telepathic weapons system.  After a refueling stop on an ice sheet where an American sub is waiting for him, he takes off and has to contend with a Russian fighter ace flying the only other Firefox in existence.  Will Mitchell Gant make it back to American soil?  Watch the movie to find out!
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is great and there is nothing i could say in my review that hasn't already been said.  Best album i have bought in a long time. I don't even skip any songs when i listen to it. Something i havent done in a long time.  I think i will review it twice so i can give it 10 stars!
B000002TQV|5.0|Radiohead mixes a brilliant CD full of depthful lyrics and soothing guitar. Black Star is personally my favorite. This CD will give you chills from the first track to the last.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have purchased this year. The other reviewer talks negatively about driving with this on, Thats one of the best times! Think of 50's riffs, Cuban flair and hardly any singing. This music must be tried with a Mojito and a fine cigar.......
B00008OWZC|5.0|I wish there were more than five stars I could rate this album with!  It is absolutely incredible!!!  I don't know how else to explain it.  It's electrifying! It's orgasmic!  It's Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, Jon Bonham, and John Paul Jones at their absolute climax!
B000059XUI|3.0|This dvd would be even better with the addition of the scenes that the ABC special had.  Why does Warner Brothers not release this version? If anyone has this version please let me know.
B0000024K1|5.0|This is one of the craziest, yet dopest hip-hop albums ever made. I believe that this album, along with Run-DMC's Raising Hell are the most influential albums of almost every genre. This is, in my opinion, PE's best album, with \\"Fear Of A Black Planet\\" not far behind.<br />This is classic old-school hip-hop. The beats are some of the best from the old-school era. Public Enemy was a very versatile group back then, sampling Slayer (a rock band) for a song among other samples. Everyone has heard Bring The Noise by now, especially if you've played Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2. In my opinion, that's not even the best song on the album. I was really feeling all the songs but Louder Than A Bomb and Don't Believe The Hype were my personal favorites. But if you're looking for an influential hip-hop album, then this is one you don't want to miss out on. Or if you want to expand your knowledge of hip-hop music this is for you too. It's eye-opening to see how much hip-hop has changed ince the late '80's, but that's not a bad thing in few cases.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Almost every song on Chicago explodes with talent and fun.  While the movie stars Renee Zellweger, who does a decent job as Roxie Hart, the star of the soundtrack is cleary Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose voice is a perfect fit for the role of Velma Kelly.  Other suprises are also included- the biggest being the show stopping &quot;When You're Good to Mama&quot; sung by rapper Queen Latifa.  It is enough to make up for the annoying &quot;Cell Block Tango (He Had it Comin')&quot; remix with Queen Latifa, Lil' Kim and Macy Gray.  It really isn't awful, but just sickeningly out of place.  Some have faulted Anastacia for singing &quot;Love is a Crime&quot;, but I found it upbeat and in the spirit of the movie.  Also included in this CD are two duets that don't take place during the course of the movie- &quot;Class&quot; sung by Zeta-Jones and Latifa and &quot;I Just Move On&quot; sung by Zeta-Jones and Zellweger.  Both are great, but the later just goes to show that Zeta-Jones can outvoice Zellweger anyday.  It's not that Zellweger is awful- she does well on the sultry &quot;Roxie&quot;. <BR>   The men of the movie put in what they can, but are clearly men among godesses.  Richard Gere's &quot;All I Care About&quot; is plain fun, and John C. Reilly' &quot;Mister Cellophane&quot; is nicely done.  I really did enjoy it, and never skip it when listening to the CD.  The five best songs are 1) All that Jazz (Zeta-Jones) 2) Class (Zeta-Jones and Latifa) 3) Cell Block Tango (ensemble) 4) When You're Good to Mama (Latifa) and 5) Mister Cellophane (Reilly).  If you skip the Cell Block Tango remix, the CD does not disappoint.
B00003CXCW|5.0|&quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; is the macabre story of Hollywood decadence turned on end.  When has-been screen writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) finds himself hiding out from the repo-guy he accidentally stumbles upon forgotten screen legend, Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) and her dark, brooding butler, Max (Eric Von Stroheim).  She's derranged.  He's desperate.  Oh, well.  Nobody's perfect.<BR>ASIDE: There's a story here: Swanson and Stroheim were once married to one another in real life.  It was his film, Queen Kelly that gave Swanson's career the black eye it never recovered from. At the time that &quot;Sunset Blvd&quot; went into production Swanson was, like her character, very much a has been.  So how did it all turn out in the end - on film; tragically.  In real life? - fairly better.<BR>TRANSFER: Paramount has outdone themselves on this DVD.  The transfer is simply flawless, exhibiting a perfect image from the opening credits to the final fade out.  The gray scale is magnificently rendered and this on a film that was on the verge of being lost to us forever.  There's no hint of edge enhancement, pixelization or any of the other digital anomalies that seem to plague so many B&amp;W transfers.  The audio has been restored and remixed and will blow you away in its depth and clarity.  Really, this is as perfect as a DVD will ever look.  The only other B&amp;W movies that look as good are Warner's &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;.  <BR>EXTRAS: Here too Paramount amazes me.  After penny pinching with no extras on practically every disc they released, Paramount opens the flood gates with a brilliant documentary on the making of the film and two featurettes.  There's also an audio commentary and the film's original theatrical trailer. YES! - MANY THANKS TO THE MOUNTAIN FOR THIS ONE.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: You must run out and purchase this disc.  It is bar-none the most perfectly rendered DVD of a classic film! Enjoy!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is more powerful in guitars and vocals. I personally think this cd is a step up from Hybrid Theory. It seems that Linkin Park is willing to take a risk, as in their song, Breaking the Habit. Meteora shows a more artsy side to this metal group. I highly recommend to those who appreciated Hrbrid Theory.
B00005M91K|5.0|This is more than a movie. Baraka trancends everyt movie you have watched. It offers a true glimpse of reality in the world.  The imagery is utterly captivating, while at the same time, sincerely touching. I could not even write a review of this movie to give it all that it deserves. This is a must for anyone looking for that something in life.
6305972591|4.0|I saw this movie when it first came out in 1984. Scared ...a 9 year old girl. To this day, I can't walk passed a cornfield without shivering. It's definitely on its way to becoming a horror classic :D
B000002N2Z|5.0|Though many will site \\"Around The Fur\\" as their best, I'm gonna have to go with Adrenaline as Deftones' best album to date. Both White Pony and their new, self titled album are amazing, but don't measure up to the rawness and rage that comes seething through your speaker when you pop this s**t in. <br />1)Bored: AMAZING! Defintely a classic record in the nu-metal genre.<BR>5/5<br />2)Minus Blindfold: Good song. I love the chorus for some reason. <BR>4/5<br />3)One Weak: I like this one aswell. It reminds me of \\"Minus Blindfold\\" a little too much though. Great regardless.<BR>3.5/5<br />4)Nosebleed: HOT!!! This song is off tha hook! It is quite possibly the heaviest, angriest, most agressive song Deftones has ever put out.<BR>5/5<br />5)Lifter: This is another great one.

Heavy, agressive, and unadulterated.<BR>5/5<br />8)Birthmark: Luv this one! Everything about it is good. <br />9)Engine #9: This might be the best song on this entire album. This song is perfect. Chino raps on this one, and shows just how influential they've been when it comes to the genre of nu-metal. Everybody either copies off of Korn or Deftones.<BR>6/5<br />10)Fireal: Good song. Nothing much to say about this one. Not the best on the album, but a great way to finish it off.<BR>4/5<br />This album is tight. While I believe that Adrenaline is their best album, \\"Be Quiet & Drive\\", off Around The Fur, is probably the best song ever put out by Deftones. I suggest you check that out, and definitely check this one out also.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Al Pacino plays an LA police detective who is being investigated by Internal Affairs and is brought to Alaska to work on the case of the killing of a 17-year-old girl.  A young police woman, played by Hilary Swank, is an admirer of his and she is thrilled to be working on a case with him.  An incident occurs during the investigation which turns everything upside down and threatens Pacino's career.  He forms an unholy alliance with a character played by Robin Williams and the rest of the movie is all about self-preservation and trying to be the last man standing.  Throughout the movie Pacino fights insomnia in the land of the Midnight Sun where darkness never falls.  The scenery in the movie is spectacular and the acting is very good.  This is recommended viewing for those who enjoy action/thrillers.

B00005JKHP|4.0|More Art Film than Pop-Action, Star Trek-TMP probably suffers it's bad reputation because there was a precognition of what the film would be.  Kubrick's 2001 has been noted as an obvious influence, but watching Robert Wise's new cut reminds of another film also.  The closer twin of Star Trek-TMP is Wise's own &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;.  This especially holds true for the way Wise visually frames the characters (almost always at arms length).<BR>Some of the films largest critcisms are now it's biggest strengths.  The unveiling of the Starship Enterprise, the flight into the V'Ger cloud, and ruminations about the meaning of life (of which the anwser is 42) are all visual and aural delights. I was even surprised at the calibre of acting among the principles. It's a shame that most of the minor non Star Trek actors are not in same league.  The people reporting from the Epsilon 9 station sound as if they are reading the six-o'clock news.  <BR>Star Trek-TMP is best enjoyed if it's dispatched from the other films and entire Star Trek legend.  In fact, if this was not a Star Trek film it would probably be as admired as &quot;2001&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot;
B00008H2LB|4.0|Ok, I like LP a lot, so I of course bought Meteora (i have hyprid theory and the remix which is my fav). i really like about half the songs and the only dissapointment i had was that it only had 13 songs(im kinda picky), but it's still worth buying.  here is a review of the songs.<br />1. Intro/ This is neat and starts off the second song well.<br />2. Don't Stay/ Great song! my 2nd favorite on the album, really catchy!<br />3. Somewhere I Belong/ This song is pretty good, not that hard and no screaming but enjoyable.<br />4.  Lying from you/ Perfection!!!Best song on the album right there! very catchy, great lyrics, everything! If I had heard this and I wasnt a linkin park fan i would have bought this cd for this song alone!<br />5. Hit the Floor/  ok, if you've seen signs the beginning of this song sounds just like it...nm..cool song little bit of everything 3rd fav<br />6.

B00008H2LB|4.0|Ok, I like LP a lot, so I of course bought Meteora (i have hyprid theory and the remix which is my fav). i really like about half the songs and the only dissapointment i had was that it only had 13 songs(im kinda picky), but it's still worth buying.  here is a review of the songs.<br />1. Intro/ This is neat and starts off the second song well.<br />2. Don't Stay/ Great song! my 2nd favorite on the album, really catchy!<br />3. Somewhere I Belong/ This song is pretty good, not that hard and no screaming but enjoyable.<br />4.  Lying from you/ Perfection!!!Best song on the album right there! very catchy, great lyrics, everything! If I had heard this and I wasnt a linkin park fan i would have bought this cd for this song alone!<br />5. Hit the Floor/  ok, if you've seen signs the beginning of this song sounds just like it...nm..cool song little bit of everything 3rd fav<br />6. Easier To Run/ neat and very lp like but nothing special <br />7. Faint/  didnt like the lyrics and sounded strange at first but then i got into it and liked it a lot!cool song<br />thats all im going to review the rest of the songs are for you to decide once you buy this great cd

B00008PC2O|1.0|I already wrote a review of this DVD about its shortcomings.  Here is an update from the horse's mouth.  After contacting InterActual about the high definition &quot;recommended&quot; system requirements here's a response:  &quot;The High-Definition feature plays smoothly on the 3.0 GHz system that we built for testing purposes, but it has varying levels of choppiness on every slower machine we have evaluated it on. The Windows<BR>Media 9 video hits the processor much harder than the video card, so the processor recommendation of 3.0 GHz is pretty much a requirement also.&quot;  This is information that people interested in buying this DVD need to know.  It's too bad that InterActual and Artisan couldn't be more honest about this on the back of the DVD.  If your computer isn't a 3Ghz with 512MB ram and a 128MB video card, I wouldn't even waste your time trying to watch this high definition version.
B000084T18|5.0|So it's not as jazzy as jeff or as funky as flash, but it does hit on some key points.  The man has been shot, stabbed, and has been in jail.  That means that he doesn't want to be on American Idol showing off his voice with Whitney Houston songs, that means he is keeping it real.  If you like beats, lyrics from someone that has been around, and the endorsement of Eminem and Dre himself, this is definately the album for you, if you aren't looking for rap, look elsewhere.
0066620996|4.0|It has always been my contention that makes a company great is not their products, not even their salespeople...but leadership at level 5!People won't buy products no matter how great they are without leaders moving them.Salespeople will not sell, no matter how great their products or compensation plan is...without leadership.Leadership...Level 5 leadership take you from good to great.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Awesome album, blows Soundgarden right out of the water.  All the songs on the album are good and it is one of the better albums i've spent 15 bucks on in a few years.<br />Best tracks are:<BR>Like a Stone #5<BR>Cochise #1<BR>Bring Em Back Alive #11<BR>What You Are #4<BR>Exploder #9<BR>Show Me How to Live #2<BR>Set It Off #6<BR>Light My Way #12<br />...all the songs are good and this is an album worth listening to start to finish, again and again.
B0000017CA|5.0|This album... well, you know.<br />Something most of are forgetting (or just don't know)... Sammy does most of the hardcore vocals.<br />I was fortunate enough to see Acid Bath live in Shreveport, La. (One of their very last shows... I consider myself blessed).
1400031362|3.0|Disappointing and worrisome. Clearly this author has been writing under the publishing gun.  I loved the first two books.  (But the second, &quot;Tears of the Giraffe,&quot; had a glaring editorial error involving the caption of a newspaper photograph--at first the text makes it clear that the caption is &quot;illegible,&quot; bug-eaten;  so I figured that would provide plot momentum for our erstwhile detective to find out the identities of those in the photo; apparently that potential plotline was dropped in a later manuscript draft, and soon, much to our surprise, the next time the photo appears, the caption is miraculously intact in all its details.) <BR>    In this 3rd volume in the series, even the casual reader will notice the simplest of editorial errors:  For example, in one storyline, lunch is first said to occur at 12, then 1 pm, then 2 pm; breakneck (and tremendously incomplete and unsatisfying) wrap-up of a few -- but not all -- major plotlines; extremely unrealistic introduction of depression theme (person, once ideal, falls victim to deepest depression seemingly within a week or two -- apparently the author was convinced midstream to introduce the topic of clinical depression)... Well, I could go on.  I'm sorry to see the evidence of author strain in this initially darling and moving series.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|This is the recording that changed me from a jazz dilettante into a full-blown fan.  It's still one of my all-time favorites.  If you've never bought a jazz cd before, I would recommend this as your first; and if you've already started a jazz collection, it's not complete without &quot;Go!&quot;  <br />Dexter Gordon is certainly one of the masters of bop, but noone has ever made that complex genre sound more accessible than Dex does here.<br />While much of Gordon's work (like &quot;Go!&quot;'s sister recording, &quot;A Swingin' Affair,&quot;) may seem more adventurous or complex, the song choices and arrangements here on &quot;Go!&quot; are gorgeous in their (relative) simplicity.  The sound is lush, the playing is first rate top-to-bottom, and the band is clearly having fun.  Not to mention that the first cut, &quot;Cheesecake,&quot; is an absolute classic.
B000001ES4|5.0|I have all 4 Secret Garden albums. I love them all but I have to say this is my favorite. It is the one with the least vocal tracks, though that's not the reason I love it. Especially poeme, home and illumination are just gorgeous songs. I am an all rounder when it comes to music, new and old, new age to rock, though New Age does have a special place in my heart. I love Enya and Clannad as well but this music is just outstanding. I was looking for some touching, soothing classical music lately, and found exactly that in secret garden, and especially in white stones. This music just sweeps me of my feet.
630463949X|5.0|Since I saw this concert on the cable TV, I was wondering how it should sound in my home theater from a DVD. This concert reveals all virtuosity of each Fleetwood musicians in a set of top rated songs, recorded on good Dolby Digital mixing. If you enjoy concerts, this one is a &quot;must have&quot;. One of the best DVDs I ever see, definitively.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is the first time I have to enjoy all Led Zep videos and live performances. This DVD is great!!!<BR>They are the best!!!<BR>I really cried when listened and finally could see alive \\"That`s the way\\" perform. I was born listened all Led Zep`s music but in Colombia was very hard to get anything about this band.<BR>I love this DVD!!! this is the greatest jewell that I never ever had seen before. Thank you Led Zeppelin for giving this DVD to your FANS. You are the very best rock band in the world.

B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is truly a &quot;love letter&quot; to the city of Paris!  The cinematography is amazing, it absolutely captures the spirit, flirtation, and incredible beauty of what is quite possbly the best place on earth!  Weaved into the backdrop is the story of Amelie and her mischevious attempts to sweeten the lives of the people around her and possibly even fall in love.  Audrey Tautou is adorable, and if you have a soft spot for this &quot;lollipop&quot; of an actress you will love this movie!
B00006EXCC|5.0|If you've made it this far just go ahead and buy the freakin' cd already!  It's arguably one of the Stone's best &quot;Brian Jones Era&quot; recordings, it has NEVER sounded better, Keith Richards and you know you want it.  Do you really need a wordy review to convince you?  Don't settle for  &quot;Forty Shticks&quot;...these songs need to be heard in the context of the album in which they were created.   Collect 'em all!
B000089RVX|5.0|Even thought Evanescense doesn not like to be called Christian music, Amy Lee's voice is the sound of an angel.  Evanescense is the best thing to hit the music industry in a long time.  I have Long been waiting for an album like this that I can listen to a 1000 times over again and not get tired of it.  The last album I could do that with was Cold &quot;13 Ways To Bleed On Stage&quot;.  Amy Lee and Ben Moody work so well together and having Paul McCoy from the 12 Stones do a guest spot was just amazing.  I give this album 5 stars - in the Classic section.  This album will forever be apart of my collection.
B00003CXB2|4.0|So I'm a sucker for an epic; this one is definitely that.  Filmed in Jordan and Morocco, it's the desert in wide screen glory.  And there's even a story in there, which, while not at all historically accurate, does occasionally move the desert scenes along.<br />No one gives fanatic looks quite like Peter O'Toole, and the quiet way in which he says something as simple as \\"yes\\" is fascinating.  This was Omar Sharif's introduction to the western film world, and he's just wonderful.  Anthony Quinn is over the top, stealing every scene shamelessly and with panache.<br />In the character supporting roles, Claude Raines is as smooth and elegant as ever.  Alec Guiness is, what can I say, he's Alex Guiness -- a man who almost disappears into each role and yet is so distinctive.<br />Maurice Jarre's music carries the movie along; without his genius, this epic would have been rather flat.  The soundtrack is well worth your money, by the way.<br />This is one of my husband's favorites.  I quite like it, too, as long as I don't see it very often.  A long separation between viewings keeps it relatively fresh, and one can spot something new each time.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I AM CHRISTINA'S BIGGEST FAN!!!  Her songs on this are amaing, and chalk full of emotion!<BR>1. Stripped intro pt 1-Not a song, but a damn good intro!5/5<BR>2. Can't Hold Us Down- The Music video to this is coming out soon!  This song is amazing!  R&B and SOUL all wrapped together, a female power song!  amazing 5/5<BR>3.

Infatuation- Great beat, and it explains a little about Christina's father.  4/5<BR>7. Loving Embrace interlude- Relaxing to listen to.  LIke water, and birds and stuff!  very very good 5/5<BR>8. Loving me 4 me- beautiful that's just one word to describe it! 5/5<BR>I'll leave it there, but I STRONGLY STRONGLY SUGGEST that you buy this album
B00008CMR6|3.0|OK, it's not the best western ever produced. It's more of a full color film in the style of the old Republic westerns of the 30s and 40s. What it does have is a pretty fast moving story line, scene stealing character actors, and very pretty music (except for Jack Elam's mouth harp...).<br /><br />Rio Lobo begins with probably the most original opening sequence in a movie.  The solo guitarist plays a beautiful tune, while we watch his fingers from in front of and from inside the guitar.  Totally cool and absolutely amazing.  Sometimes, I watch the movie just to see this sequence.<br /><br />John Wayne is moving from leading man with love interest to lovable old coot. Jorge Rivera takes over as the hunk. This is early in his acting career and very early in his English, but he's a doll to look at and OBTW, he does an outstanding leap over a fence. Christopher Mitchum looks very much like his father, and the chemistry between him and Wayne is similar to that of his father and Wayne (see Bob in El Dorado and Chris later in Big Jake).<br /><br />This was Jennifer O'Neill's fourth movie, and it shows. But Wayne was famous for introducing new actors, even when it was clear they needed practice. Must have been because of the way Wayne himself was mentored in the 30s by John Ford, et. al. Watch his early work and see his own improvement.<br /><br />Sherry Lansing was sexy and later vengeful. In the latter role, she, too, chewed up the scenery. She could have had a respectable acting career, but chose to shatter the movie mogul glass ceiling instead, and more power to her.<br /><br />Then there are the scene stealers. David Huddleston can steal one just by being in it. Victor French is both scary and a coward simultaneously, a hard combination, but he can certainly pull it off. Hank Worden only had one scene, but he's as neat as ever. And finally, Jack Elam was a scenery chewing, crazy eyed loonie, with some of the funniest lines in the whole movie.<br /><br />No, it's not the best, but I like it. It will always be in my personal movie stash.best, but I like it. It will always be in my personal movie stash.
B000069HK2|5.0|When i heard The Used for the first time, I thought it was disgusting.  But after a few times more listening to them I was hooked.  The whole cd is simply amazing.  The whole cd is excellent, this is the only cd that I own that i never skip over any tracks when i listen to it.  But my favorite tracks are bullimic, Blue and Yellow, Noises and Kisses, Peices Mended, and Buried Myself Alive.  It is totally worth the money.
0393057658|5.0|While this book does seem to put Billy Beane on a much loftier pedastal than his peers in the business, his track record so far as the general manager of one of the most financially constrained teams in baseball cannot be argued.   I found it interesting to see what a minor role the manager and the players seem to play in the whole scheme of baseball.  The author portrays Beane as a grand (and somewhat imbalanced) puppeteer, pulling all the strings according to his whim.  So far he's managed to keep the strings from tangling, but whether this has been attributable more to luck or skill remains to be seen, and ten years from now we'll probably be able to more clearly evaluate his talent as a GM. <br />In any case, the author does paint a fascinting picture of daily life in the front office for his readers.  Wefeel like we're in the same room with Beane and his compatriots, eavesdropping on their unique style of approaching the business.  The stress and triumphs of the environment are brought to life, and we definitely feel like we're part of the action.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold's \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is one of the most unique books of fiction to come along in years. It's about a murdered young girl watching her family's reactions from death. The only others that are in the same category of being highly unique are the \\"Harry Potter\\" books by Rowling (also fiction) and the book, \\"West Point: Character Leadership..\\" by Remick (creative nonfiction). If you enjoy unusual books, be sure not to miss Ms. Sebold's wonderful book, or the Rowling and Remick books, for that matter. I'm sure you'll find them all intriguing.
B000067IZ3|5.0|The only thing I can really say about this movie is... WATCH IT!!  It is phenominal.  I am not going to break the movie down bit by bit and tell you why it is good, and what was great artistically.  Just watch the movie if you haven't already, and if you have, watch it again.  One of the best films, if not the best film, of 2001
B00003CX5P|2.0|I for one was very dissapointed with this first in the prequel trilogy in the Star Wars saga. <br />To me, \\"Phantom Menace\\" is just a mess of bad script writing, weak acting by the cast, and just mediocre dialog. The storyline was weak and sadly, \\"Phantom Menace\\" damaged my faith in the Star Wars prequel trilogy until \\"Attack Of The Clones\\" came along. <br />The Pod Race scene though in my opinion was extremely awesome and saved \\"Phantom Menace\\" from hitting the bottom of the garbage can. <br />Still though, overall, \\"Phantom Menace\\" in my opinion, adds nothing to the legendary Star Wars saga. <br />Things though got back on track with the vastly superior \\"Attack Of The Clones\\".
B00005JLPK|1.0|POSITIVE ELEMENT: \\"Frida\\" was filled with lush color that appropriately complemented the \\"painter\\" theme.  For example, the scene after the bus accident where she is laying on the floor covered with shimmering gold dust was very well presented.   <br />NEGATIVE ELEMENTS: <BR>     NUDITY- There was plenty of nudity in this film, which was distastefully approached.     <BR>     LANGUAGE-  The script was poorly composed.  There was plenty of bad language and much of what was said was self contradicting.  For example, in the movie, Diego states that he cannot promise to be faithful to Frida but he will be loyal.  Also, when Diego cheats on Frida, Frida states that its her fault.  <BR>     SEXUAL CONTENT-  Much of the film contained sex scenes.  It seemed as though when one finished another began.  These scenes shown were not tastefully portrayed, rather, they were poorly presented.  The scene where Frida is intimate with another woman was absolutely unnecessary.  If the producers wanted to show that Frida was bisexual, then they should have insinuated it rather than display such a sinful act.<BR>      OTHER: It seems as though the negative qualities of the heroine of the film were concentrated on more so than the positive. Although her paintings were majestically shown, her character was of a drinker,an atheist, an adultress, and a bisexual.<BR>  <BR>OVERALL: Although the vibrant color and still scenes of Frida were well presented, the negative elements far outweigh the positive.  When I went to see this film, a few people actually left the theatre during the film when the distasteful sex scenes were shown.  As I left the theatre, many were remarking on their disappointment towards the film.  Their disappointment, as well as mine, was largely due to the distasteful manner in which the film was presented.
B000002KBA|5.0|FAST, FASTER FASTEST THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF SPEED, BACK THENAND  IN ROCK MAYBE EVEN WAY BACK THEN IN 1970 AS FAST AS THEY PLAYED IN A BLUR BACK THEN THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE THE FOREFATHERS OF SPEED METAL AMEN!
B00008H2LE|5.0|Well, Linkin Park has been making this album for the last 18 months or so, and has finally come up with a very impressive followup to Hybrid Theory to say the least. However, like many other people have said, their number one flaw is how short this CD is, clocking in at just under 37 minutes, which is even shorter than Hybrid Theory. But, moving on, here's a breakdown track-by-track:<br />1. Foreword- For 13 seconds of Mike beating up his CD burner, it's not that bad...although intros don't really appeal to me. 5.75/10<br />2. Don't Stay- A good way to start off the album as the Foreword zooms right into this. Chester takes control of this one, singing the verses and screaming the chorus. 8.25/10<br />3. Somewhere I Belong- The first single, we all know it...the chord progression in the beginning is cool, and the music video is amusing as well. Chester's screaming coupled with Mike's rapping sets the tone for the rest of the album. 9.25/10<br />4. Lying from You- A decent song, the familiar set up of Mike rapping in the verses and Chester yelling in the chorus. Has a similar theme to some of the other songs- becoming more like themselves and becoming less like other people or things. 8.5/10<br />5. Hit the Floor- An ok song, a lot of weird sound effects. Starts off relatively quiet, but then busts into a hard chorus. 7.75/10<br />6. Easier to Run- Definitely has the potential to be a single, a very solid song throughout. Reminds me somewhat of Crawling, but in my opinion, this one's even better. Very nice lyrics as well. 10/10<br />7. Faint- The second single, a very fast paced song (well, by LP standards) comes out with nice rapping lyrics by Mike and solid shouting by Chester. The bridge, though, is very throaty and loud. Great song, overall, though. 10/10<br />8. Figure 0.9- Similar to other songs on the album, such as Lying from You, this is a decent break between Faint and the next song...8.5/10<br />9. Breaking the Habit- A change of pace from what we've become used to on the album. It's just Chester singing, displaying that beneath all that screaming he has a melodic voice. It's about a guy who knows he's a rotten person but wants to fix his life. No screaming or rapping in this song. Supposedly it took six years to write, but it was worth the wait. 9.5/10<br />10. From the Inside- Another great song, Chester's voice in the chorus is dead on, great lyrics, great music, it's all good. 10/10<br />11. Nobody's Listening- Well, I guess you can't win 'em all. For me, this one doesn't sound that good. The flutes in the background are a nice change of pace, but all in all the words are just repeated too much and there's too little variety. 7/10<br />12. Session- I didn't really like Cure for the Itch on Hybrid Theory, and I don't especially like this one. If you listen to a song called Session, make sure it's the Offspring one from Ignition. While the other tracks blend into each other nicely, Session just kind of abruptly ends...I wonder what happened. 5/10<br />13. Numb- A good way to end the album. Chilling lyrics, nice music, and an overall great sound end the album off with a bang. 9.25/10<br />So, in the 37 minutes you do get out of this CD, you won't be disappointed. Each track blends with the next one very nicely, aside from Session, so as soon as you're done listening to one the next one's already in full swing. This CD also comes with a bunch of bonus features when you put it in your CD drive, and a bonus DVD that has information and details about the making of Meteora, such as how they got the sound for Somewhere I Belong.<br />All in all, if you liked Hybrid Theory, Meteora, while different, should still appeal to you. A little more variety in the messages in the song would have been nice, but all in all, there are plenty of gems on this CD, and very few duds. The bonus DVD is definitely worth getting, even if you're not a fan of Linkin Park. Give it a listen, you'll find something you like.album. It's just Chester singing, displaying that beneath all that screaming he has a melodic voice. It's about a guy who knows he's a rotten person but wants to fix his life. No screaming or rapping in this song. Supposedly it took six years to write, but it was worth the wait. 9.5/10<BR>10. From the Inside- Another great song, Chester's voice in the chorus is dead on, great lyrics, great music, it's all good. 10/10<BR>11. Nobody's Listening- Well, I guess you can't win 'em all. For me, this one doesn't sound that good. The flutes in the background are a nice change of pace, but all in all the words are just repeated too much and there's too little variety. 7/10<BR>12.

B00006RAKP|5.0|Just what the title says. Recommended for anyone with ears
B00008LDPU|4.0|The &quot;shorts&quot; on the Animatrix are just that, ranging from around 7 minutes to about 11, with &quot;Osiris,&quot; &quot;Program,&quot; and &quot;Detective Story&quot; as the cream of the crop. The CG effects in each are subtle enough and well integrated not to be a bother. <br />Extras? The DVD has director bios, and full-length commentary for some, but not all of the shorts (both Renaissance films, Program and World Record). There's a trailer for the already out Enter the Matrix game, making-of documentaries on each film, and &quot;Scrolls to Screen: The History and Culture of Anime,&quot; which is a should see for any new or reasonably educated anime fan. <br />The art certainly ranges; Kid's Story (by Bebop director (Shinichiro Watanabe, who also does Detective Story) is extremely rough, much like A-ha's &quot;Take On Me&quot; video, while Beyond takes on a pastier, Perfect Blue-like appearance. Yoshiaki Kawajiri (of Ninja Scroll fame), gives anime fans some familiarity with &quot;Program,&quot; which is a crisper version of &quot;Ninja Scroll&quot; with the female lead even resembling Kagero. <br />How does the story deepen your &quot;Matrix knowledge/experience&quot;? It varies. The &quot;Renaissance&quot; set gives a dose of history, of how everything came to be; &quot;Osiris&quot; is a near direct tie-in to the trilogy; &quot;Kid's Story,&quot; &quot;World Record&quot; and to an extent, &quot;Beyond&quot; show how normal people (the way Neo used to be) find other ways than being contacted via hacking, to be awakened to the real world. &quot;Program&quot; shows that there are other simulations similar to what Neo was put through, but with different time periods, and levels of reality (my personal favorite). <br />It's unrated, but violence is extremely graphic and hard to swallow at times; there are flashes of nudity, but not anything excessive, the same with love scenes or similar material. The stories aren't too complex to leave you scratching yourhead, but do expect a certain level of intelligence to put it all together. <br />The pieces are extremely short, so maybe you might be satisfied by renting or borrowing it instead of getting it to own.
B000002LRX|5.0|There are very few albums out there that come close to being perfect. For me, Angel Dust is one of these albums. FNM shot for the stars with their song writing and arrangments, and they pretty much made it. It could be a little heavy, abrasive, and disturbing for some, but give it a few listens. Mike Patton is one of the best vocalists in rock and roll history. He can sing like the biggest rock star, scream like a demon, rap, and belt out like an opera singer (sometimes all in the same song). I have to hand it to the entire band for upping the ante so high. Faith No More is a great band, and this is simply one of the best albums of all time.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|About a Boy is hilarious British humor!  <BR>Not a sappy romantic comedy, more like a real-life commentary  ~ on life.  The \\"boy\\" sums it up when he says at the end, \\"Two is not enough, you've got to have backups.\\"
B00003CXPD|5.0|Setting: Ireland in the mid-80s<BR>Backdrop: A miner's strike, a lockout, poverty, anger<BR>Setup: Billy's father has scraped together the $$ for his boxing lessons, but Billy would rather take ballet.<BR>Plot: the local ballet teacher senses his genius, tutors him, and suggest he audition for the London Ballet<BR>You can imagine how this goes down with his macho father and older brother...<BR>The scenes of Billy dancing, leaping, flying through the town on the cobblestones will make every single person grin and tap their toes along with this gifted child performer.<BR>In deft staging, Billy Elliot gently explores politics, religion, sexuality, and family relationships.<BR>An absolute must-see movie for everyone, especially for those who are fans of all things Irish.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay is one of the best bands to come out in recent years and they keep getting better and better!<br />Their first album Parachutes and single \\"Yellow\\" were some of the most irresistible ear candy of 2000, and the rookies of the year have returned with this equally palatable, if slightly steelier, sophomore collection.<br />Here and there--as on the album opener \\"Politik,\\" with its seesawing major/minor crash of guitars--the London-bred group displays a hitherto unheard tendency toward truly rocking out. But the majority of the album won't ruffle those who were captivated by Coldplay's acute melodic acumen, which remains the band's greatest strength. Tracks like \\"Daylight,\\" the acoustic-based \\"Green Eyes,\\" and the set-closing \\"Amsterdam\\" will all appeal to those still jaundiced from the group's initial hit. \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\" are by far the best songs of the year!<br />Front man Chris Martin continues to mature vocally, and keeps his soaring Thom Yorke-style swoon in check for most of the proceedings. In all, a very tastefully crafted, tuneful, and affecting piece of work with a band that is still just beginning to tap its enormous potential. Their concert gave a taste of some new music and I can't wait to see what they do next!!!! If you're going to buy one CD this year, buy this one!!!
020530902X|5.0|As the 'rules' in this iconic book take up only 14 pages, it continually amazes me how often I can find the answer to a grammar or punctuation guestion within those pages. It doesn't cover everything, and some of the 'rules' are of course changing with the passage of time - but if a wannabe writer can't afford a whole bookcase of tomes on How to Write, then this is the one he or she should buy.<BR>Beyond those 14 pithy pages, however, are another 100 or so that extend the value of the book immeasurably: Principles of Composition, Commonly Misused Words, and perhaps the most valuable: An Approach to Style, which gives excellent advice along the lines of Do not overwrite, Avoid qualifiers, Don't over-explain, Avoid adverbs, Avoid dialect, Don't inject opinion, and tons of others.<BR>When all's said and done, however, one of the very best parts is a wonderful essay by the inimitable EB White himself - the Introduction, which serves as a perfect example of all that the rest of the small book preaches: write concisely, clearly, and well, and say something worthwhile.<BR>Other books for writers to consider: Bird by Bird, On Writing, and Writing Down the Bones.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna's music keeps changing with the times and that's a good thing. While her earlier music had wonderfully danceable beats and cheery pop lyrics, her latter work seemed more personal and beautiful, brilliantly touching on the human soul.<br />American Life is no exception, taking the listener on a unique musical journey into Madonna's life. The music here is personal and emotional and that's what makes the album so good. Most people might be put off by it, since it definitely isn't typical Madonna, but with a few listens, it just might grow on you.<br />\\"American Life\\" is one of the best singles of the year and \\"Hollywood\\" is fun and catchy. \\"Die Another Day\\" is also included here and no matter how many times I hear it, I want to get up and dance. There is not one single bad song on this album. They are hypnotic and beautiful and definitely worth listening to.<br />A wonderful addition to Madonna's wide range of music.
B00000JR29|3.0|When I was but a wee lad, I made the important and fortunate decision to purchase this masterpiece album by T for F.  This record album was so listener-friendly even me stodgy mum and pa enjoyed it.  In fact, the record album spun on our record player non-stop.  As a family, we literally played this record all the time, and I think we wore it out.  Sometimes I'd play it outside and the music would blare and echo amongst the hills of beautiful Scotland.  At any rate, there are some very diverse sounds on this T for F record, which will please all listeners of the world.  The bursting energy of &quot;Shout&quot; is a stellar leadoff tune, and I used to sing this song to myself a lot before getting ready to play golf (a fun game that began in Scotland).  Quickly, however, this record delves into a jazzy sound on the second song, and from there the music is wide-ranging in terms of depth and sound.  There were several hits from this record album, but even the ones they never played on radio were quite good.  It was made in the '80s and is thus a little shorter than record albums made these days; but shorter albums in the '80s seemed to have better songs, because the artist had limited recording space.  Yeah, these guys were creative, and they went on to make other great albums.  They kind of have a pop/adult contemporary vibe, so that even your pa and mum will enjoy them.  <br />I have many other favorite American pop bands, but T for F might be one of my favorites.  <br />From Scotland, signing off...<br />Thank you
B000066NW0|5.0|When I first heard the wonderful single \\"Complicated,\\" I could not have imagined the artist being so young. The song became a hit and everyone kept talking about it, with good reason. Here was an artist was such powerful vocals and such emotion when she sang, it was amazing! And she was only 16! With her next single, Sk8er Boi (to be adapted into a movie by Paramount), Lavinge gave us a catchy, cheesy, and wonderful pop song that had teenage girls everywhere wanting a sk8er boi of their own. In \\"Losing Grip\\" and \\"I'm with you,\\" her vocals challenged those of Alanis Morrisette, but they are by far her most 'adult' track and single. While both sugary and sweet, the album is also brilliant and powerful and a superb debut. Here is one artist I can imagine getting better with age, she has a gift for performing and a talent for writing. Cannot wait until her next CD (and the movie!!!) Go Avril!!!
0385504209|5.0|This book is simply magnificent.  The plot is very fast-paced, but it is also evenly distributed and never lags.  Brown has put together a fascinating look at religion, art, and modern intrigue, blending the three seamlessly.  While the plot is somewhat predictable, this book is meant to simply be enjoyed and to revel in the details.  The facts are astounding and will actually make you question the fine line between Brown's research and his imagination.  You'll be doing frantic online searches to view the art discussed in the book and look for the details that Brown points out.  Also, if you have been to Europe or would simply like to go, this book poses an extra delight by taking place in many of France and England's most famous attractions.  Simply stated, this book will be impossible to put down and must be bought and savored.
B00006HBAD|5.0|This Album is totally different than the US  version. In the booklet that came with the double CD, she thanked numerous people for the 3 years spent on the project.On the all audio CD there are 16 songs instead of 13. She has numerous guest appearances from the likes of Don Henely and Stevie Nicks. The Second CD has the live audio from Abbey Road Studios,and the enhanced stuff on it. What really blew me away was the enhaced version it had videos of Soak up the Sun and Steve McQueen. The video of Soak up the Sun seemed to take place in Hawaii and had surfing beaches just like what you'd do when a person is &quot;Soaking up the Sun&quot;. Overall a solid A+.
B00005JM1F|4.0|I thought it looked incredibly stupid at first, but I was laughing the whole time through! The acting is good, Will Ferrell is hilarious, and the script is superb!<br />I give Old School 4 stars instead of 5 because while I loved it, some of the jokes were a bit... tasteless....and I didn't think the 2 naked girls wrestling in KY Jelly was really necessary.<br />I don't usually like most &quot;teen&quot; comedies these days, but this was great. I definitely recommend it if you want a good laugh.
B0000630BT|5.0|If someone needs to start somewhere, this is the place.  This is a fine metal album, no other words.  Apart from the title track, which I am quite bored of, to tell the truth, the others are great metal songs- guitars, drums, singing, the whole.  <BR>Indeed, I discovered it a bit late (13 years, a bit...), but it hasn't lost it's magic.  Bottom line- go and get it, you night crwalers!!!
6305603847|5.0|Not really Oscar material, this movie is so disturbing and strange that it's exciting.  The cinematography and art direction is amazing.  It's these bizarre films from the 70s and 80s that are exciting in they way they show things on a movie screen that no one ever sees in a conventional film(like Ann-Margret swimming in baked beans shooting out of a TV in TOMMY and dead corpses sucking blood from a live person in TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  Alan Parker is really great at adapting \\"pop movie musicals\\" to film after seeing his work with FAME and EVITA in 1996.
0517548232|3.0|Hazlitt analyzes the broken window fallacy as applied to everyday economics and economic policy.  The basic idea of analyzing the consequences of economic policymaking on every group in society instead of just certain special interest groups is sound.  But there is much more to this book than that.  The Keynesians are decried and the book is essentially a tribute to laissez faire capitalism.  This is fine except like Von Mises and the rest of the crowd there are implicit assumptions which are never addressed on every page.  That is the basic problem with the deductive approach to economics: it is not deductive.  Nobody ever points out that Hazlitt assumes virtually every curve in economics is linear or at best only very slightly nonlinear.  That simple assumption despite what Hazlitt says is critical.  The shape of these curves probably change over time and are deeply related to whether the \\"free market\\" or Keynesians are mostly correct.  I suspect very strongly that which is best changes over time and that extremes either way are detrimental to the population and government.  It has always been fascinating to me that although a large free market school has developed over time none of them appear to do any real mathematical or economic analysis ( If they did they would understand what a bunch of hooeey much of the content of this book and others is.) and that one notable free market proponent i.e. Greenspan may be getting ready to do a very Keynesian thing to the economy.  In the long run objectivism and laissez faire capitalism have become interwined and confused over time and suffer from the same problems.  I am not a government controls proponent.  I have the same problem with the government intervention policies: it is essentially knob-twiddling and I have a congenital disorder which causes my rear end to seize up whenever the knob-twiddlers start up.  It would be different if they actually knew what they were doing but even the stupid realize that they really don't and even Greenspan freely admits as much.  Nor am I Keynesian in outlook.  I noticed recently they are trying to justify themselves in textbooks by pointing out that inflation may not really cause much damage to the public and that what actually causes the damage are some of the things that occurred concurrently with inflation in the past.  There oughta be a law against this kind of tripe.  Inflating the economy just for the fun of it has caused all kinds of damage this century.  There may be times when inflating the economy a little may be the way to proceed.  But the hyperinflation of the 1965 - 1985 timeframe did many people in the population a great deal of harm and yes much of it was due to phenomenon which accompanied inflation instead of the inflation itself.  But that may be the character of inflation.  Many of the neo-Keynesians were in diapers during this time and the record is not as objective as a scientist would like.  The truth lies somewhere out there at any given time and I suspect that economists that are not too tightly glued to any one school of thought are the most likely to find it.  Let's hope someone is looking.
B00008YLV2|5.0|The new 3-Disc Deluxe Edition of Blackhawk Down is one<BR>of the best DVD's you can own. Toss out the single disc version.<br />The Making of Blackhawk Down movie is 2.5 hours long. I haven't seen it before. It is SPECTACULAR. It shows you scenes that should have been added to the original film but had to be deleted due to length. This movie could have been another Apocalypse Now marathon if more of the scenes shot on 1 million feet of film were included.<br />The added documentaries from the History Channel and PBS Frontline put the film in a political context. President Clinton is never mentioned in the actual film.<br />The initial helicopter assault on the target building is filmed from 6 different angles and was repeated 3-6 times. You can watch each angle or all six at once as part of the extras.<br />The minimal footage of the 160th SOAR helos in the movie, are made up for by being in the background in almost all of the Makin' of scenes. Incredible flying.<BR> <BR>The Delta CQB assault on the target house is included as a deleted scene that should have been in the movie. <br />I have new respect for the actors who are shown in Ranger, Green Beret, and 160th SOAR training learning to move, shoot, and fly like the real SF troopers. This training effort made them look more believable in the movie.<br />The actual movie is an afterthough after spending 4-5 hours watching the extras. If you have any connection to the military or SF, this is your ultimate DVD.<br />This 3-Disc Deluxe Edition Blackhawk Down DVD leads the way!!!!
B00006690G|5.0|This is a truely great cd overall. It's funny, serious, and dramatic all in one.  Em really shows off his talent with this album.  Whether you love him or not, Eminem really is an immensly infamous person, and for good reason.  He's not against gays or women.  Hes only joking, and if you don't think it's funny then just don't listen and put in a Will Smith record or something.  He even says when he's joking, but protesters just don't care.  They don't listen and all they hear is the negativity.  Well, forget about them and have an open mind when you listen to this album, or any of Eminems, because he's huge, talented, and he's not going anywhere soon.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Even if you're not a Matrix fan (and who isn't) this is an excellent DVD.  It contains eight (nine shorts, two are part I &amp; II)stories that explain different aspects of The Matrix universe.<br />Attention to detail is what all serious animation should be, and this DVD takes it past all limits.  Each short story is  produced using different styles of animation and all are superb (When I first saw &quot;The Final Flight of the Osiris&quot; I thought the characters were real people. Incredible detail, down to the light shining through the thin fabric banners hanging throughout the training hall).<br />I would highly (no, enthusiastically) recommend this movie to all.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|George C. Scott's finest performance as the larger-than-life General Patton. Apart from Patton's military career, this film tries to uncover who the man really was. The genius of modern warfare? A romantic warrior from another time? Or perhaps a crackpot? Perhaps Patton was all of these and more.<br />Even in the massive scope of WWII this film keeps Patton firmly at the center. Regardless of his historical contributions to the war effort, we see him as the stuff of legend -- the kind of epic hero about whom poets like Homer used to sing.<br />As we follow his breathtaking career from the North Africa campaign to the end of the war, we see how Patton's ongoing collisions with the Nazis rivaled those against his own soldiers and superiors.Here was a man who only found purpose in warfare and who almost failed to appreciate it's painful, human element.<br />In the end, Patton triumphs, only to acknowledge that he is just playing a part in a historical drama.
0385504209|5.0|I could not put this book down. I noticed that some Christians were offended by some of the ideas, but, speaking for myself only, as a Christian woman, I thought the book was amazing. The detail and research in this book make you want to go and read more about DaVinci, The Last Supper, Winchester Cathederal, the Louvre...almost every major landmark mentioned in this book. I didn't agree with all the conclusions, but you don't have to agree to be engrossed in this novel. I'm going out tomorrow and buy all of Dan Brown's novels, and I can't wait to stick my nose in them. This by far the best book I've read in years.
6302994063|5.0|Okay, maybe that's an overstatement, but the first time I watched this movie, I checked it out of the library.  I was a recently divorced single parent of two, struggling with a house note and bills I couldn't pay. On this particular day, I was fighting a bad cold, and feeling generally tired and unhappy.  I took this movie out based only on the \\"Two Thumbs Up\\" recommendation of Siskel & Ebert at the bottom of the case.  After viewing this film, I felt energized and full of good humor.  I eventually bought it and have shared it with my mom, sister, kids, friends, and new husband.  They all loved it!  Where do I start? 1. The performances.  Everyone in this movie is wonderful.  They are believable and credible even though the material is completely over the top so much of the time.  I love these people.  2. Then there's the romance.  The main love story is very sweet, but all throughout the film, you feel like romance is literally in the air.  It's also amazing how much sensuality is conveyed without any overt sexuality.  3.  The dancing. I never gave ballroom dancing a thought until I saw this movie.  Now, I love watching it.  4.  The family relationships.  They may seem unbelievable, but that mother is all too familiar to me.  5.  Paul Mercurio--he's hot! Enough said.<br />This movie is funny, touching, and like nothing I've ever seen before or since.  I can't even compare it to anything else.  I'm happy to see how favorably other people have reviewed it.
B0000844IT|5.0|Not to sound like a 70's hippie, but this movie really is \\"Groovy.\\" Here is my lineup for the Evil Dead movies in greatest to worst. We start #1 with Evil Dead 2:DBD. Then #2 with Army of Darkness. And last we have #3 with The Evil Dead. Evil Dead 2 was when Bruce Campbell really shined, but in here, he shines a little bit more of his comedic and brave side in his character. I gave the first one at #3 because I found it boring, but I still enjoyed it. I'm a huge fan of the Evil Dead series and will be forever. Now, onto the review of this beautiful and excellent DVD.<br />Anchor Bay, Sam Raimi, and anyone iffiliated with the Evil Dead trilogy, have now given us a so much better deal on Army of Darkness. Instead having to spend around forty something dollars, you only spend about half that on The Boomstick Edition, and you get the Theatrical U.S. Cut version of the film which runs at 81 min., and you get the Director's Cut which runs at 96 min. Theatrical's picture and sound are top notch but doesn't include the cool deleted scenes and the alternate ending. The Director's Cut gives us a fair picture with fair sound and includes all the deleted scenes and alternate ending. Plus, on the Director's Cut, you get 4 more deleted scenes and a good as Evil Dead 2 commentary, storyboards, and a monster gallery.<br />Fans of the Evil Dead trilogy will appreciate and cherish this ultimate DVD edition of Army of Darkness. You get two movie for the price of one! What better deal is that!? The movie is filled with Bruce Campbell's best one-liners and cheesy, hilarious acting, and awesome brave hero action with Bruce Campbell against the skeleton army and his evil self. So, fans of Evil Dead, hurry up and pick up Army of Darkness: The Boomstick Edition up right now, immediately! It's the one of the best things thats happened to the trilogy.<br />P.S. For more awesome Evil Dead fun, play the Evil Dead:Fistfull of Boomstick game for PS2. It's really fun and awesome!
B00006IUL7|5.0|This is a great movie! I could'nt get enough! Supurb performences from the entire cast. The direction was fantastic, and the sceanrey was awesome! Very thrilling and I recomend this movie very much! Go see it, you'll love it! especially Hillary Swank! She's awesome!
B00005B36H|4.0|First off I would just like to say Tool is NOT heavy metal!! If anything Tool is the step above Progressive Rock on the music revolutionsary ladder. Ok with that out of the way...<br />Lateralus faced a lot of anticpation and hype on it's release being that it had to follow up the album Ænema. While I don't think it lived up to that hype it don't not dissapoint. <br />Lateralus takes Tool not so much in a new direciton, but, in a deeper direction. A lot of people say that Tool was experimenting on this album. To me, it feels like Tool is just delving deeper into the stlye it created. And they do a wonderful job. This CD is complex and captures a multitude of moods within it's hour plus of play time. The only issue I have with the album is you need to devote yourself to the CD when you listen to it. This songs are so long and have such complex (and beautiful) intro's that you can't just put the CD in with others and hit random. You need to listen to the whole thing. Track 7 Parabole can't actually be listened to (in my opinion) without listening to Parabola first (Track 6).<br />If you are looking to get into Tool I would still recommend getting Ænema first. And if you are a Tool fan and don't have it, what are you waiting for.<br />Lighter, more complex and more of an experience, Lateralus is and excellent album. Congrats, Tool.
B000002UA5|5.0|first of all, the live CD is great. It consists of great early-Floyd-tracks.<br />then to the best part: Studio CD<BR>powerful &quot;Sysyphus&quot; has scorching sound and very radical progressing, as the music fades out and then just blows again(first time I heard it I almost got a heart attack).<BR>&quot;Grantchester Meadows&quot; is a beautiful acoustic track with nice background sounds<BR>&quot;Several Species...&quot; is probably weirdest Floyd track, but it's a pleasure to ears<BR>&quot;The Narrow Way&quot; is great Gilmour track, but only negative thing about it is that vocals could be clearer.<BR>&quot;The Grand Vizier's Garden Party&quot; is also weird, coloured with stereo effects and opened/closed with flute solo.<br />This is an Floyd album I'd recommend to everyone.
B000002J09|4.0|Okay, so some people might not like this album, that's fine. I don't review whatever music they like and tell them it's bad. <BR>  As a classic rock album, this is one of the best out there in my opinion. Among them are Physical Grafitti, Sticky Fingers, The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon.<BR>  I list them so you have some idea of what type of music I listen to, and you may actually use this review to guide your selection because there are others who rated this influential album very poorly yet did not state what they were looking for in an album.<BR>  I find all of the songs on this album very listenable. Yes, the chorus riffs of Rock and Roll and Black Dog are quite similar, but let's face it, there are a whole lotta songs built around an A chord. The Rolling Stones made four songs out of the &quot;Brown Sugar&quot; riff (not that it's an A chord) by arpeggiating it, playing it backwards, in different keys, etc so don't go on about it.<BR>  Bottom line: everyone should listen to this album, if only for Stairway to Heaven, but there are other songs that are just as good.
B000002U9W|4.0|although the overall album is great, I always turn to hear the title track, &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot; and &quot;Summer '68&quot;. from the scorching intro(AHM) to the funky sections and Gilmour's solo to the fuzzy sounds and mixed section - as pure Floyd as one can get, except the symphony orchestra and choir. I dropped one star off because I don't like rest of the tracks &quot;If&quot; and &quot;Alans ... Breakfast&quot;. But Floyd it is and one of my fave tracks.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I remember when I was 10 and heard Led Zeppelin for the first time.  Nothing of the genre before or since has measured up to the majesty that is Led Zeppelin.  I have most of what Zeppelin committed to disc and video and have to say that How The West Was Won and the DVD set are so good.  I've watched the DVDs at least five times and continue to find new things.  Just to marvel at the interaction between these guys is something else.  They obviously got off on what they played.  The CD set complements the DVDs- so enjoyable.  You won't be disappointed.
B000002UA0|5.0|As if we're looking for fuzzy album from both cover and the sound<BR>this album is the first thing that comes to my mind. Every single track from beginning to end is great, especially the spaceous &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot;, childish &quot;Matilda Mother&quot; and scorching &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot; made me to love this album. Masterpiece it is. To me.
B000000WCA|5.0|It's been 7 years & this album is still being played in my CD player. When I was 9, I listened to this...it brings back alot of memories. The Spice Girls used to be so strong. Back in 1996-98 they basically ruled the music world. They were the best-selling group since the Beatles. That's a huge accomplishment. Back when they came out there was nothing else like them around. No Britney, no Nsync, no Backstreet Boys...it was new, fresh, fun, and it was awesome. Here are my reviews on the tracks featured on the Spice Girls debut album \\"Spice\\".<br />01 - Wannabe  (10/10)<br />This is the song that started it all. Who hasn't heard it? It's got catchy lyrics, and it's alot of fun to dance to. A great song.<br />02 - Say You'll Be There  (10/10)<br />The 2nd single the girls released. A wonderful song about telling someone that in order to have you completely, they have to promise to stick around.<br />03 - 2 Become 1  (10/10)<br />My favorite Spice Girls song ever...no wait, my favorite song ever. This song is so beautiful, and the lyrics are amazing. I could never get tired of it. This single sold 4 million copies worldwide alone.<br />04 - Love Thing  (7/10)<br />A fun song, but it's nothing very special. It does have catchy lyrics though, and the verses are really fun.<br />05 - Last Time Lover  (10/10)<br />One of my favorites on this CD. A very fun, upbeat song. It's got a more edgy, raw sound to it. Very creative.<br />06 - Mama  (10/10)<br />This song is for all the mothers out there. I know I dedicate it to mine. Beautiful lyrics. Just a nice, slow ballad.<br />07 - Who Do You Think You Are?  (10/10)<br />I love this song!! It's alot of fun & the girls always performed this song so well! Definetly a song to dance to!<br />08 - Something Kinda Funny  (8/10)<br />Very simple & kinda slow, but overall it's nice. Very creative lyrics, and the girls sound amazing on it.<br />09 - Naked  (10/10)<br />A very, very good song. Again, very creative lyrics. These girls can write! I love Geri's vocals on this one as well as Emma's. The verses are amazing!<br />10 - If U Can't Dance  (9/10)<br />A great song, but the verses can get kinda boring. Emma's verse which is the b-section is very fun though & she sounds really sexy in it. I loved it when they performed this song!<br />So as you can see, overall the \\"Spice\\" album would probably be a 9/10 if not a 10/10. There's 10 songs, it's short, but it's an awesome album with great songs that have very creative & thoughtful lyrics. The vocals are great. This album has sold over 30 million copies worldwide, and that is a record. They are the reason pop music is around today. It's just sad that the genre was ruined with so many artists coming out imitating. This is the kind of pop music that I will always remember. The Spice Girls are a musical legend in their own right. They accomplished alot in 2 very short years & though it ended quickly, the fans will never forget. Don't miss out on this album if you don't have it already. It's a true delight & alot of fun!s vocals on this one as well as Emma's. The verses are amazing!<br />10 - If U Can't Dance  (9/10)<BR>A great song, but the verses can get kinda boring. Emma's verse which is the b-section is very fun though & she sounds really sexy in it. I loved it when they performed this song!<br />So as you can see, overall the \\"Spice\\" album would probably be a 9/10 if not a 10/10.

0385504209|4.0|If, like me, your idea of great television is the Discovery or History channels, you'll love this book. I won't go so far as to say that Brown weaves together his fact and fiction \\"flawlessly\\", but he does it in the best interest of an entertaining read, and really, isn't that what we're here for?<br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this book is a murder mystery whose clues all involve a secret society's beliefs about the Holy Grail. The plot is presented in \\"real time\\", with the more complicated explanations taking the form of flashbacks to the university classes taught by the main character, Robert Langdon. It was in these flashbacks that I felt the book bogged down the most, as the students' dialogue invariably consisted of the \\"3 Ws\\" - \\"Wow!\\", \\"Whoa!\\", and \\"Will this be on the test?\\" Their awe and ingenuousness at the neato-keeno things their professor is presenting is so unbelievable, especially for anyone familiar with real college students, that they jarred me away from the narrative.<br />Aside from that, expect to be surprised, shocked, and maybe even a little offended - but again, isn't that what we're here for? Brown has done his research, and whether or not you agree that his theories are correct or not, the fact is that there are some societies who believe in them. Learning about those theories alone made the book worth reading for me.<br />The plot itself is basic, a standard mystery/chase scene scenario that plays out across Europe. There are a few twists, but chances are pretty good you'll see them coming. The puzzles and cryptographs are witty, if inconsistent in their level of difficulty, and the characters are like milk - smooth, bland, and they go down fairly easily. The cookie is in the details and theories, and it's there that Brown has spent his time. Readers, you need the milk, but you're really there for the cookie. Swallow it down, you won't be disappointed.
6305212139|5.0|Still on their worldtour after Geri's departure from the group, the remaining four Spice Girls sit down for interviews & they also talk about Geri's leave from the group. After 30 minutes of interviews comes the concert that is just hard to describe in words. It is nothing short of AMAZING! This video shows the entire concert with no editing & the girls perform so well. It's just awesome & the BEST concert video you'll ever own. Get this!<br /><br />EDIT: FOR THOSE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR THIS CONCERT ON DVD, JUST TO LET YOU ALL KNOW YOU CAN FIND THIS DVD AND ISTANBUL OFFICIAL DVDS ON EBAY, THEY ARE REGION 0 AND PLAY WORLDWIDE...THEY WERE RELEASED IN 2008 :))
B00005QGAT|5.0|Michael Jackson's first solo album as an adult is one of his greatest works of art. This album is not only just songs, it is a collection of works of art and great masterpieces.<BR>Don't stop 'till you get enough:9/10 Wonderfull. I love this song, so catchy and so great to listen to again and again<BR>Rock with you:9.5/10 Wow! This is an amazing slowish song that I love and it makes me feel great<BR>Workin' day and night:8/10 Really nice song, catchy and makes you want to dance<BR>Get on the floor:9/10 Wow!

Fantastic, as always is with Michael Jackson
B000069HK2|5.0|The Used put out the self-titled CD, and it's amazing from start to finish.  The best CD I've bought this year, and probably ever...<br />1. Maybe Memories - 9/10<BR>Awsome song, with their average screaming vocals.  Love the way the beginning jumps in, and the chorus is great.  <br />2. The Taste of Ink - 10/10<BR>My favorite song, ever.  A lot of people find that this song loses it's touch after awhile, and with the radio play it's getting maybe so, but I love it nonetheless.  Never have I heard a more catchy, awesome song.<br />3. Bulimic - 7/10<BR>A decent song, but far from one of my favorites.  This seems to be a song that people either love or hate.  I've find it sort of repetitive now, but it's still a good song.<br />4. Say Days Ago - 8/10<BR>This is one of those songs that you should skip the first few times you listen to the album.  Until you can get used to Bert's screaming, this song might seem horrible.  About a month after buying this CD, it's now one of my favorite tracks.  Love the chorus.<br />5. Poetic Tradegy - 7/10<BR>One of the quiter, softer more melodic songs on the CD that breaks into a powerful chorus.<br />6. Buried Myself Alive - 8/10<BR>Another catchy song, I love the guitar during the verse.  Probably my 3rd of 4th fav. song on the CD.<br />7. A Box Full of Sharp Objects - 7.5/10<BR>The song that gets a lot of people hooked onto the Used, this song ranges from intense screaming to the average Bert sound.<br />8. Blue and Yellow - 9.5/10<BR>My 2nd favorite song on the CD, and one of the quitest.  The way this song was written is just ingenious.  I cannot think of anything bad about this song (except for the fact that it is no Taste of Ink).<br />9. Greener With the Scenery - 7/10<BR>One of my least favorites, this song has it's moments, but overall it can't compare with some of the others.<br />10. Noise and Kisses - 9/10<BR>The drums are awesome in this sock, if you take the time from listening to the lyrics to listen to it.  Right up there with The Taste of Ink and Blue and Yellow.<br />11. On My Own - 8/10<BR>The quitest song on the CD, this acoustic is a great one.  A nice change from the screamy songs that come before.  The great thing about this album is that it has such a variety of songs.<br />12. Pieces Mended - 6/10<BR>Probably the worst song on the CD in my opinion, and another that you might want to skip the first few times.  As you get into the latter stages of this song, it turns to the hidden song &quot;Choke Me&quot; at the end.
B00005QGAV|5.0|This is a terrific album that speaks on its own<BR>Jam, wondeful<BR>Why you wanna trip on me?, Tabloid song, very nice<BR>In the closet, masterpiece<BR>She drives me wild, can be better<BR>Remember the time, amazing classic<BR>Ican't let her get away, nice song, and catchy<BR>Heal the world, amazing!<BR>Black or white, great work of art, I love it<BR>Who is it?' incredible song<BR>Give in to me, amazing and catchy, full of energy<BR>Will you be there, Wonderful, though I would have liked to hear Mr. Jackson sing a bit more<BR>Keep the faith. sorry, but not a nice song<BR>Gone too soon, my favorite, makes me cry<BR>Dangerous, really nice though a little too much talk<br />All in all, wonderful album, a great buy<BR>Definitely recommended
B000084T18|5.0|Every single track on this lp is off the...hook. Seriously, this was the only album I had in the cd player for about 5 weeks in a row. There is no bad track. I sure hope he doesn't get killed cuz I can't wait for his next album.
0385504209|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time!  I loved the way Brown intertwines a great mystery thriller with puzzles and history.  From page 1, this is a page-turner.  I had to keep forcing myself to put it down to get anything else done.  I recommend this to people who love puzzles, number, history, and mysteries.  Don't be scared off by the religious themes - the possibilities explored in this book are fantastic and well worth the journey.
B000002BSG|3.0|I found this cd at Goodwill and for 3 bills it was worth it.  Really wouldn't pay anymore for it, though, sorry to say.  Virtual Insanity is a stellar track, every time I hear it, it reminds me of the video where all the furniture is moving around the room by itself.  =)  But besides that a lot of the tracks are basically filler trying to hard to clone the disco vibe of the 70's.  Like Cosmic Girl, ack just plain bad..  Maybe if you don't take this cd to seriously and try to analyze the lyrics, you will enjoy more then I.  Then again maybe not, it's merely average.  ((zero decibles))
B00005J6T1|5.0|Who would have predicted that this self titled album, released in 1983, would begin a career that has so far spanned 20 years? Surely not the record company executives. When first released, Madonna didn't even make a dent in the charts.<br />Then in 1984, Holiday was released as a single and the rest, as they say, is history. For an album that only has 8 songs, Madonna managed to spawn 5 hit singles. Very impressive for a debut album.<br />What amazes me listening to this CD all these years later is how well the music stands up to todays' standards. Certainly, there is some (slight) aging - musical production and the technical wizardry behind it has seen massive leaps in the past 20 years, but the music contained on 'Madonna' feels as fresh and original as if it were released today (though perhaps with some slight tweaking).<br />The hit singles Lucky Star, Borderline, Everybody, Burning Up and Holiday are well-known Madonna songs, however it is the remaining 3 songs that surprise again all these years later. 'I know it' (my favourite on the album) has a lovely melody and lyrics. 'Physical Attraction' could easily be heard on dance floors today and 'Think of Me' shows Madonna's developing skill as an astute songwriter.<br />Included on this digitally remastered CD are 2 bonus tracks. 'Burning Up' (12 inch version) seems to be the original 12 inch released all those years ago. 'Lucky Star' (new mix) is basically an extended version of the original with some bells and whistles added - certainly no 'new mix'. Though they are excellent inclusions that may otherwise be hard to source.<br />Whilst fans who were around during the early years will probably have this, those who have become fans in the following years should definitely pick up a copy and hear the beginnings of what would turn to be an amazing musical career of a twentieth century pop icon.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I didn't know what to say when I first listened to this album. I'm not quite sure what I expected from it, but I am now thouroughly happy that I purchased this CD. Christina has successfully evolved from a catapillar with virtually no visible talent to a beautiful butterfly with an astounding voice and writing ability.Every track on \\"Stripped\\" is worth a listen and there are absolutely no fillers on this album. Here is my track-by-track review of Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\".<br />1) STRIPPED INTRO - This is a lovely introduction to a great album. Here, Christina warns us that this is the REAL her. A great cut. ***91/100***<br />2) CAN'T HOLD US DOWN - In this song about women empowerment, Christina confronts the double-standards that women face today. A great message. Lil' Kim's rap in this upbeat track complete the song. ***90/100***<br />3) WALK AWAY - This is my favorite on the album. The haunting music and Christina's stunning voice mesh together beautifully to create a sad, and chilling song. You can definetely feel Christina's pain i this one. ***100/100***<br />4) FIGHTER - This is the third single from \\"Stripped\\". With Dave Navarro on guitar, and Christina's brilliant lyrics and powerhouse voice, this is a rocking tune with a powerful message: Be Strong. ***97/100***<br />5) PRIMER AMOR INTERLUDE - A nice 51-second interlude with Christina talking in spanish to an acoustic guitar melody. ***87/100***<br />6) INFATUATION - A latin song that sounds a little bit like Christina's 1999 debut; only much, much better. ***88/100***<br />7) LOVES EMBRACE INTERLUDE - This is a prelude to track 8 and is beautifully done. I think that she should have included this with track 8. But, nevertheless, its nicely done. ***94/100***<br />8) LOVING ME 4 ME - A very slow-tempo song with calm, soothing vocals that sound almost virginal (ha! we all know that's a lie! lol!). This is another favorite. ***99/100***<br />9) IMPOSSIBLE - A nice jazzy track with great lyrics and great music. You can't go wrong with Christina on the mic and Alicia Keys in the producer's chair. ***95/100***<br />10) UNDERAPPRECIATED - A flawless R&B song with a grooving bassline. Christina belts out nicely in this one. Another favorite of mine. ***97/100***<br />11) BEAUTIFUL - The second single released from \\"Stripped\\", this is another faovrite. Inspirational in so many ways, this song makes me feel great. Whenever you're feeling low, listen to this and within the 3 minutes 58 seconds of the song, you'll be smiling. The lyrics are meaningful and just down-right beautiful. ***98/100***<br />12) MAKE OVER - No, this song isn't a song about giving makeovers. This is an English-hard rock sounding song with lots of screaming and the word \\"bulls**t\\" is thrown around a lot. You get a lot of energy coming from this one. ***92/100***<br />13) CRUZ - A beautiful ballad about leaving everything behind and just driving down the highway toward a new life. Beautifully done. ***86/100***<br />14) SOAR - Another excellent inspirational song. The song's message is simple: Be Yourself. ***98/100***<br />15) GET MINE, GET YOURS - Well, well, well. This song is interesting. The song's subject is casual sex. Even though, some might call Chrisitna trashy for doing a song like this, I think it's a nice step forward. Almost all of Americans have casual sex, so why shouldn't Christina express something that we all do through song? This song just makes you feel sexy. With the sensual lyrics and the cool music, this is a favorite. ***97/100***<br />16) DIRRTY - The first single from \\"Stripped\\", this is my 2nd favorite, aside from \\"Walk Away\\". Even though this video (quite raunchy; I like!) was an instant hit on MTV, the song absolutely flopped on radio. It peaked at No. 48 in the US. But it spent three weeks at No. 1 in the UK. Nevertheless, I love this song. Can anyone say \\"PARTY ANTHEM!\\"? I dance wildly to this one in my room. ***100/100***<br />17) STRIPPED PT.2 - A continuation fromthe introduction (track 1). In this one, Christina informs us that she's not a virgin, nor a slut. Good for you, Christina! ***96/100***<br />18) THE VOICE WITHIN - This one gives me chills. A somewhat sad song about...well, I'm not quite sure what it's about! But, you can tell that this song means a lot to Christina. ***93/100***<br />19) I'M OK - This is a scary, thruthfull, chilling song about Christina's abusive childhood. She confronts her father about his abusing her mother. You can hear Chrisitna cry in this song. I shed a couple of tears after my first listen of this song. ***98/100***<br />20) KEEP ON SINGING MY SONG - A great way to close an astounding album. A great message to all of her fans that says: No matter what, I will \\"Keep on singing my song.\\" Christina belts out a really long beautiful note in this one and her vocals are just amazing. ***99/100***<br />All in all, Christina Aguilera's \\"Stripped\\" is a 5-star album that shows the ups and downs of her life. I am looking very forward to Christina's next project. You go get 'em, woman!<br />FAVES SONGS:<BR>Walk Away<BR>Fighter<BR>Loving Me 4 Me<BR>Underappreciated<BR>Beautiful<BR>Soar<BR>Get Mine, Get Yours<BR>Dirrty<BR>Keep on Singing My Song<br />OVERALL GRADE: 99/100
B00005Q4CS|5.0|'Requiem for a Dream' illustrates what most movies fail to do - the devastating effects of drug addiction. Before watching this movie be warned that it is ultimately very depressing with shocking graphic imagery.<br />The story revolves around young New Yorker Harry and the most important people in his life - his Mother, girlfriend and best friend. Whilst Harry, his girlfriend and best friend are addicted to drugs as a choice of escaping from their lives, his Mother is addicted through medication prescribed by 'health professionals' and because of this, it is the saddest story of all. Whilst for a short time the drugs increase the success of their lives, they soon fall into a downward spiral, though at no time does the film become preachy.<br />The film depicts drug taking as a fast-edited series of shots that works brilliantly. The downfall of the characters produce some of the most realistically harrowing scenes I've seen on film, especially those featuring the girlfriend. The final scene of her sex performance is very disturbing.<br />If you can handle the negativity of this film, watch it to see how drugs can severely affect life.
6305841861|5.0|For a lot of fans, this is the pinnacle of the \\"Evil Dead\\" series, mainly because it strikes a balance between the shocking gore of the first film and the more humorous antics of the third (\\"Army of Darkness\\"). \\"Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn\\" has its righful share of zombies, decapitation, screaming and buckets o' blood, but in the end it comes across more as funny than horrifying. In between the killings are cheesy lines, slapstick comedy and a general feeling that the whole thing is way too preposterous to be taken seriously. Although filmed on a relatively low budget, the look of this movie is convincing and enhanced by director Sam Raimi's inspired camera work. A must-see movie for anyone who enjoys a little humor with their horror.
0385507755|1.0|As an ex drug abuser,and as a writer, I've never been so offended or enraged by a book. Pretentious, overblown, self indulgent, lazy writing and patently, proveably false \\"confessional\\" It is loathsome beyond words to try and foist these ludcrously predictable characters and stale plot developments on the public as the \\"real\\" experiences of a recovering addict in Hazelden. If it really happened--how come every plot twist: the crackhead girfriend found with old man--the gangster with heart of gold and judge help out the hero for comfy plot resolution--for example-- telegraph themselves miles ahead--like a \\"very special episode\\" of Friends. And notice the sketchy--almost casual reference to\\"records being expunged\\"...and the shying away from the  basic proveable biographical elements  of the author's life. Notice that the author--though supposedly downing quarts of booze, fistfuls of crack--and incredibly, GLUE and GASOLINE, manages to graduate from college, spend a year abroad, keep his friends, and support himself. The supposedly badass hero will have us believe he intimidates and faces down everybody who gets in his face. Always ready to get all Eastwood. Yet he's laughably tiny in real life--and curiously devoid of scarring from the huge wound in his cheek the book opens with.There are holes in this story you could fit an MX missile through. And the sentences are bad. Judith Krantz bad. The fact that they are lined up like \\"poetry\\" don't make them any better. I hope some of his \\"classmates\\" at Hazelden decide to blab--or that someone chooses to look deeper into the story--as they did with Caracaterra's SLEEPERS. Should make really interesting reading. Nice to know Minneapolis has such a thriving drug district right by the station, too. Author boy seems to have avoided needle drugs and lead-related brain damage nicely as well.
B000002ADT|5.0|Miles Davis' 1959 opus &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; is one of the most popular jazz albums ever made, another one of those rare &quot;every home should have one&quot; recordings. Even if you're NOT a big jazz buff, you should have this album. So, what is it about &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; that makes it so special? I can only say that Miles Davis and his cracking band of jazz greats---Julian &quot;Cannonball&quot; Adderley, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Wynton Kelly, Paul Chambers and Jimmy Cobb---created an album with outstanding mood &amp; melody, where all the notes ebb &amp; flow, and where all the musicians get to strut their stuff without stepping on each other. There's no instrumental &quot;noodling&quot; to be found anywhere on &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot;. The album has a great cohesiveness to it, where every improvised note you hear makes perfect sense. Miles Davis knew that musical magic could be achieved through spontaneous invention, as long as each piece had a basic &quot;setting&quot; for the musicians to work within. Davis &amp; company rise to the challenge and then some on &quot;Kind Of Blue.&quot; From the classic opener &quot;So What,&quot; to the concluding &quot;Flamenco Sketches,&quot; the music is wonderful, melodic and breezy, but most of all, cool. It's amazing to think that this classic album was finished in a mere two sessions, with every track except one nailed down in a single take (&quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; took two takes to complete). Drummer Jimmy Cobb famously said that &quot;Kind Of Blue&quot; must have been made in Heaven. I couldn't have said it better myself. I don't claim to be a top authority on classic jazz, as I'm just starting to check out the classic recordings, and there are many fans of the genre who know much more about it than I do. But I do know what I like, and I LOVE Miles Davis' &quot;Kind Of Blue.&quot; It's a jazz masterwork that anyone can like, and that everyone should own. God bless Miles &amp; his supreme team of musicians for this legendary album.
B00005JLXE|1.0|When we saw the ads for Daredevil on TV, we thought \\"Wow, what a cool movie!\\"  So we went to see it in theatres.  Big, big mistake.  The only thing that made it slightly more tolerable was the soundtrack.  Excellent music, but the plot and acting in the movie were definitely lacking.  In a nutshell, the plot was everybody getting revenge on everyone else.  Oh the drama!  You can only have so many people who hate each other before it starts to get old.  Of course it didn't help that everyone in the movie was slightly insane.  Who on earth would get a target imprinted into their skull?  Who wears pleather leggings?  Who kills people with paper clips and playing cards?  This show needs some serious help.  Unfortunately, I fear that it is beyond salvaging.  And then the closing line.  \\"This city doesn't need a guardian angel.  It has a guardian devil.\\"  How enthralling.
B00008LDPU|3.0|I was expecting to at least be able to run it with English subtitles. I'm a big fan of Japanese Anime, but was a bit annoyed that I had to watch this in *all* Japanese. I'd be very interested to hear other folks experiences...<br />The animation is really well done, though I thought the imagery in the Renaissance pieces was a bit, well, sick. The level of violence was unnecessary IMHO as well as overly graphic in a very negative sense. <br />On a visual level, it was quite well done. Some of the plotwork could have used a more effective writer and/or editor, but the visuals redeemed the segments.
B000021XR5|3.0|Why am i always so dissapointed with STP's albums? Is it because they're never as good as what the single indicates? After the dissapointment of No.4 i have come to the conclusion that STP are essentially a singles band. They just don't seem to have it in them to release a consistently great album. The following album Shangri la dee da follows the same trend. \\"Sour girl\\" is the deceivingly great single this time. Talk about great pop melodies, the beatles would be proud of that one. Ofcourse the fans of old will relish in songs like \\"down\\" and \\"no way out\\", which aren't bad but just seem like desperate attempts to keep thier old grunge/hard rock image. Other standouts are \\"sex and violence\\", \\"church on tuesday\\" and \\"Atlanta\\". The rest is mostly filler ranging from okay to awful. I think STP could release a very great \\"Best of\\" album.

You've got to keep up with this one, so you don't end-up walking &quot;Two Steps Behind.&quot; You can be a party &quot;Animal&quot; if you want, but mind your &quot;P's and Q's.&quot; <br />I ain't &quot;Foolin'&quot; around with this one, but I think it's a sure bet. The astronauts need a good &quot;Rocket&quot; to get them to the red-planet of Mars, to see if life really exists out there. You'll warm up to this song but be aware, &quot;When Love &amp; Hate Collide.&quot; <br />&quot;Armageddon it&quot; with a fast car and ride away into the sunset. &quot;Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad&quot; on a rainy-day, when a nice-kiss from your sweetheart brightens the day? <br />It was back in the &quot;Rock Of Ages&quot; that Def Leppard's love-songs of the '80's, melted in our hearts with mass &quot;Hysteria.&quot; I wouldn't want to &quot;Miss You In a Heartbeat&quot; with a glance and a warm-hello. <br />&quot;Bringin' On The Heartbreak&quot; doesn't necesarily mean it's the end of the world as we know it; it's just the beginning of things to come with this great band. <br />So don't be afraid to open the Vault, it's a treasure that will last a lifetime.
B00005JM03|5.0|A very smart caper with a solid story line.  Usually I watch a movie like this and have to patch over obvious weaknesses in the plot to enjoy it, but this movie seemed very well done.  It wasn't the most original movie (ignoring that it's a remake of course) but it did have original foils and schemes as any movie of any genre should have. The opening scene is one of the best honey pot schemes I have seen in a while.  Kudos to the cast, especially Seth Green, this is the first I've seen him play his type of character and he played it well.  I'm a techie and I HATE it when a movie makes the \\"tech\\" guy ramble about irrelevant technical terms and bang loudly on a keyboard the whole time just to pass the point that \\"hey, this is the tech guy...\\"
B000096H33|5.0|This one totally knocks the tar out of the original. The original TB shows its age on a good stereo system, and it was one of Mike's first recording efforts, so it's not exactly polished, even if it was awesome. With this edition, Mike's bringing an extra 30 some years of experience to the table and it really shows. There are a few minor changes, all for the better in my opinion. Still, it's basically a note for note remake with timing so perfect you'd swear you were listening to the original most of the time if it didn't sound so much clearer, deeper, and resonant. I've seen a lot of complaints from people over the years about the quality of the original TB and how they'd like it so much better if it were cleaned up... this version is made for those people.
B000066NW0|5.0|If you took Alanis Morisette in her prime and made her younger and a little more anger / attitude, this album is about what you would get. Throw in a little Cranberries for the middle songs and a little bit of Lush for the later songs. Pretty good variety within this range.<br />My 9-year-old son wanted it for &quot;Complicated&quot;, which has had a lot of airplay. In fact, the first three tracks get a lot of airtime at our local roller rink (rollerskates and inline skating), especially for the younger crowd. Pretty good rocking.

B00008NRI8|4.0|For this genre, it is a typical romance-comedy. The actors are very good, but the story is a bit tiresome -- so much like all its competition. A good &quot;date&quot; movie with microwave popcorn, but not outstanding.
0399236201|5.0|A villan out for revenge, a unlikely hero, and a computer that can wipe out 3/4's of Europes population! That right there is a one sentence summary of the action-packed book Stormbreaker. Alex a 14 year old boy is our unlikely hero and was hired a a secret agent in place of his uncle who died on mission that MI6 gives him. that mission was called \\"Stormbreaker\\". Now they are sending Alex on that mission to find out why someon is giving out the world's fastest computers to all the schools in Europe. The man giving them out is Herod Sayle. He is a revenge hungary man. He has put is biocemicaly enhanced diseases into the computers so when tthey turn on all of Europe will be exposed to the disease. Now Alex is the only one who can stop him.<br />I thought this was a great book and recommend it to all.
B0000524CY|5.0|Easily one of, if not the best horror movie of all time. The special edition here is worth it, if you are a freak like me and actually watch this repeatedly. However, there is one thing I notice with all the reviews, \\"possessed by the devil.\\" The demon in the movie is not \\"satan\\" or the devil in fact but, \\"pazuzu.\\" Feet of an eagle, paws of a lion, head of a dog, tail of a scorpion, with four wings and usually holding his right arm up. Sound familiar? Like the statue in the desert at the beginning of the movie. And as well as the off shots during the possession (beside the door, look close, there it is). All in all this is a fantastic movie, no one in Hollywood (i.e. where art goes to die) has even come close to this movie in its ability to scare people. Even the sequels don't come close. If you're a horror movie fan and by some wierd ass logic you don't have this yet, or you just want to get the crap scared out of you, do yourself a favor and click \\"add to basket.\\"
0679411585|5.0|As a young 36 year old woman, I was born about seventeen months after the events in this book occurred. My Grandfather served in the British Special Forces during the second world war, and in the army for close to 20 years spanning before and during that war. I guess, my interest in his war time experiences, (which left him with some terrible physical and emotional scars), has ultimately led me to this truly compelling book, even though it is of another war and time. I saw the movie, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" recently, and was totally stunned and blown away by it. I wasn't simply crying as it drew to an end, I found myself attempting to control the strong urge to sob, as the tears flowed freely, and had found the tears came quickly through various parts of the film as well. After watching it, I took a note of the name of this book, \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young\\", and went on line here and purchased it immediately. This book is incredible and riveting reading, and so very shocking and eye-opening to a 36 year old woman who has only ever known war through her Grandfather's stories. I find the book and its companion movie a truly poignant and moving account of love and courage and comradeship and incredible self sacrifice. The soldiers and other service men (and women) deserved far, far more than the limited recognition they received during and after Vietnam for their courage and self-sacrifice during the years of the conflict. \\"We Were Soldiers Once... And Young\\" is a book I believe all young people should read, in order to open their eyes about what their fathers, uncles, older brothers, cousins and fellow countrymen, (regardless of their country of origin - I live in Australia myself and many men [and women also] from here served in Vietnam), went through during this conflict, and what they had to do for each other in order to survive. This war may not have been popular politically, but that was not the fault of the servicemen involved in fighting it. These men simply did, what they had to do to survive, and to try to keep their comrades around them alive. As Lt. General Moore says in his book... \\"No greater love hath no man...\\" (than to lay down his life for another). So very poignant and moving. I feel privileged to have read this book, and to have felt (to still feel) deep into my heart and soul the emotions and the love within it. Deepest, sincere thanks to Lt. General Hal Moore and Joe Galloway for putting down in print the stories of these fine, brave men in combat. I highly recommend this book as essential reading. Thank You.

B00008DDSC|5.0|I had heard of this movie last year, but it wasn't brought to any of our local movie theaters.  Then, it came out on dvd and I still hadn't rented it (even though I'm a huge James Spader fan.)  After a friend recommended it to me, it still took me a month to go out and rent it.  <BR>I didn't think I would like it too much, but still, James Spader lulled in my three bucks.  When it was over, I was amazed.  I loved this movie.  It's an odd love story that just pulls the viewer in.  I found it interesting that in the beginning we see Lee as a frumpy, unpolished girl who evolves into a woman in front of our eyes with the help of Mr. Grey.  The formula ends with the tables turning in a sense with Lee being the dominant one in the relationship (at least I interpreted it that way.)  There were moments I was laughing my butt off (four peas, a small portion of mashed, no, cream potatoes, and all the ice cream one could want) and there were moments I was in shock (bathroom, typo letter, and the lady in the next stall).  <BR>I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants a different kind of love story.  James Spader did an excellent job (still can't forgive him for some of movies he's done in recent years) and Maggie Gyllenhaal was delightfully charming.
B0000042BZ|5.0|I usually do not care for &quot;movie&quot; versions of opera, preferring a filmed live performance, but this one is most enjoyable, and has some standout performances.<br />Released in 1983, it was made on location in Mantua, with good cinematography in a pallete of browns and dark greys.<br />Pavarotti is the Duke of Mantua, looking strong and robust, but I must confess I thought his performance very one-dimensional, continually loud, and as an actor is much the weakest in the cast.<br />Edita Gruberova's Gilda is extremely interesting; she gets stronger in each scene, and I found her performance to be quite touching and wonderful. Her &quot;Caro Nome&quot; is one that I truly loved, full of sweetness and vulnerability, and delicate trills.<br />Ingvar Wixell's Rigoletto is superb, brilliantly portraying the many sides of the hunchbacked jester, from maliciously plotting revenge, to tenderly loving his daughter and the memory of his wife. His voice is rich and full, and he makes the most of Verdi's gorgeous score.<br />Victoria Vergara is a stunning and seductive Maddalena, and Ferruccio Fulanetto's Sparafucile is a creepy villain with very scary jagged teeth, and both are in fine vocal form.<br />Riccardo Chailly conducts the Vienna Choir and Philharmonic with great pacing, and this is a Rigoletto well worth watching, even for those who like me, are not &quot;movie&quot; opera fans.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Jeff Beck is one of the most talented people in 20th century music scene. His playings are not only emotional but intelligent. He knows how to go with other players. Above all, He's at home in various genres including rock, blues, funk, jazz etc.<BR>Here on this album, the band members are all great and all of them know what should be done on their own positions. And even the producer is so great either. From the opener, You Know What I Mean showcases firmness of the band. On the following, the beatles' original She's A Woman, Jeff's using different tones and effects including talk box, which really works! Richard Bailey knows how to play his drum as Constipated Duck, AIR Blower and Scatterbrain showcase it. On the rear part of Air Blower, the excellent idea of dragging down the tempo makes the song ingenius. Scatterbrain's main theme is a series of fast passages that rocks. String parts on this song are short but real fit. Beck plays moody instrumental love song which is different from any of others(Clapton, Page, Moore etc.) have done. His originality comes especially from his profound understanding of jazz, in my opinion. Freeway Jam is the tune with high tension. Diamond Rust is a hidden treasure, last but shining one! It is almost a classic.<BR>Throughout the whole album shines the string arrangements by G.Martin and the solid supportings by Middleton and Bailey. These 6 People(Beck, his band and the producer Martin) made Blow By Blow a triumph. It can be even called a concept album. Classic!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I've read alot of the reviews here...so many people expecting another repeat of the Rumors album...thank GOD they spared us a repeat of it.  I would expect that after 26 years, these musicians have grown and continue to write music that reflects what they've experienced since 1977. First of all, Stevie Nicks was 29 when they recorded the Rumors album...she's 55 now.  I'm only 34 and I'm an entirely different person than I was 5 years ago.  I happen to believe that Stevie's experienced alot of life since 1977 and she's moved beyond writing songs like Dreams and Gold Dust Woman.  Also, I think she's moved beyond grieving for the lost love of Lindsey Buckingham. <BR>And for those who think of Christine McVie as writing pop fluff...just listen to the songs she wrote for Tusk such as &quot;Over and Over&quot; and &quot;Brown Eyes&quot;..they are and will always be intensely beautiful songs.  They are some of my favorites.<BR>Let's stop getting caught up in a time warp, okay?  Enjoy the music of the past but let's also learn to enjoy Fleetwood Mac's music of the present and the future!
B00005JLSE|5.0|When I first started to watch this movie I was nervous because I thought that it might be another Moulin Rouge but in the first 5 minutes it had me convinced that it wasn't. Chicago is has a wonderful cast which includes Acadamy Award Nominee Renee Zellweger as Roxie Hart who is imprisoned for the murder of her lover. Acadamy Award Winner Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Velma Kelly, the nightclub star who is in the same prison as Roxie for murdering her husband and sister. Then Richard Gere enters as a hotshot lawer who has never lost a case. All the cast memebers sing using there own voices and also dance. This is a great film and I hope that everyone gets the chance to experience it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|It wasn't until I visited Iceland that I could understand that Sigur Rus translates the Icelandic landscapes into sounds.<br />Their magical and low paced music is a guided tour through the Blue Lagoon, Gullfoss, and Þ&oacute;rsm&ouml;rk. Each track makes you feel as if you were walking on the green moss, the ice, and the lava fields of Iceland.<br />I recommend listening to their music while you drive across Iceland. And once you are back home, it will make you remember your Icelandic adventures.
B00003CXC6|5.0|Rashomon is about the war.  The image of a half-destroyed Japan as represented by the half-destroyed Rashomon gate appears in the opening scene.  Beneath it, several people find shelter in the undestroyed portion, and as the rain forms them into a group, they seek to understand why a terrible crime has occurred.  Rashomon opened to Japanese audiences in 1950, about four years after the Emperor spoke to his nation and ended the war.<br />Watch carefully as Kurosawa takes his audience through the process of understanding.  We never get to the truth of the actual events of the murder, and that was the experience of the Japanese public regarding their country and WWII.  Instead, like their truths, the truth seen by the Rashomon audience is distorted through viewpoints.  The warrior class samurai-turned-bandit knows he'll be blamed, and then recounts the episode with self-aggrandizing machismo in true kamakazi fashion.  The cleric did accurately recall the deceased's weaponry in type and number and didn't see the woman's face.  The woman says she can't remember if she's responsible, but we all know she herself was a victim.  The dead man, who speaks to us through a medium, claims responsibility for his own death, and thereby absolves the living -- almost.  Later we learn that the woodcutter, the average Japanese worker, saw the whole thing and did nothing to stop it.  That, as it turns out, is the most horrible crime of all.<br />The movie concludes at the Rashomon gate, where we are left with the guilt of the average Japanese citizen for failing to stop the warlords, and a priest.  We then discover that in the half-destroyed structure, there is now someone else, an orphan.  The skies clear and the woodcutter, who already has six children, insists that the priest allow him to take the baby.  Charity is penitence.
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is sad yet insightful look into the world. The book is incredibly depressing, yet it shows how an old man can look death in the eye and not even blink, teaching his beliefs until his dying day. Excellent book, even better than the TV movie with Hank Azaria and Jack Lemmon.
6305095566|4.0|The movie tells that a group of five teens went to a small cabin in the Tenessee mountains. In there, they have ressurected the Evil force, known as a Kandarian Demon. They find also a deadly book, the Necronomicon Ex Mortis (Book Of The Dead), which is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood.<BR>The movie has lots of violence and gore (that's why it's rated NC-17).<BR>The reason I don't give this edition five stars is by the fact that there are no extras, no booklets, nothing else but the movie. The movie itself is surely a 5-star one...<BR>So, if you are a horror fan, you must own this movie. If you do not have a DVD Player, if you're still in the old VHS system, buy this cult classic.

6304953747|5.0|I own it and I'm glad I do, because it's a Limited and Numbered Edition. <BR>The movie is well-known for all of you, I suppose, so I won't even tell you the story.. But this movie is still my favorite of all time.<BR>There is a booklet inside this VHS. It is \\"The Evil Dead Journal\\" by Josh Becker, and he tells, as a diary, how were things going in the prodution, how were the actords and everything at his point of view. The booklet is fully colored, full of cool pictures. The is also a mini-poster and some Tom Sullivan artworks in the reverse side of cover sleeve.<BR>It's digitally mastered. Full screen. But not closed-captioned... There is also the Theatrical Trailer after the movie...<BR>It's rated NC-17 because of real gore, blood and plenty of violence.  If you get disgusted easily, do not even watch this movie. But for you who are looking for lots of horror, you've reached gold...
B000069AUI|5.0|great stuff...i didn't know what to expect but this blew me away. green eyes is a great song and i love the acoustic guitar in it. clocks has a completely different sound with the piano/bass arrangement and it's very good. i don't quite feel they match up with u2, but give them time and they just might if their following albums are as good as this.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Most people listen to the White Stripes and hear a sparse drum part with a singer screaming over guitar chords.  I think they need to be more open minded and stop listening to mainstream rubbish known as modern rock.  The White Stripes make an album that breaks rock n' roll down to the bare essentials.  Jack White composes crunchy, fuzzy guitar lines to mesh with Meg's primitive, pounding drum parts to make music that is so simplisitic it's startling.  Howling songs like \\"I Don't Know What to Do with Myself\\" and \\"Ball and Biscuit\\" show Jack and Meg on top of their game musically and continually showing listeners that you don't need glossy productions values to make a classic album.  If your still stuck listening to Staind, Good Charlotte and any other band that's grinded throught the mainstream rock meat processor, I pity you for missing out on an album that will surely be remembered years from now.

Kid's Story: Another short that ties in with Reloaded introducing a new character called The Kid, who frees himself from the Matrix.<BR>4. A Detective's Story: Comes before the first movie, telling of a detective called by agents on a case to track down \\"The Red Queen\\"(a.k.a. Trinity) but then realized he's being used. Bad ending.<BR>5. Program: Even though this has nothing to do with the movies, this is very good. Story about a woman who must choose between being free or being reinserted back into the Matrix with her boyfriend.<BR>Well thats it cause the rest suck even though World Record is halfway decent. But still worth it for the full Matrix experience.

B000002HRE|5.0|After reading some of the negative reviews of this album, I was compelled to write one of my own.  I have loved everything this band have done from the start (excluding St. Anger which is a major let down) and am quite baffled by some of the comments contained in some of the negative reviews.<br />Sure, both Load and Re-Load sound different from Kill `em All and Ride the Lightening but what do people expect?   Metallica have had the vision and ability to grow beyond just another good thrash band and to try new things, new sounds, new ideas.  They have changed and developed over the years and have constantly produced something new and awesome.  It's not selling out or going for radio airplay as some have suggested......it's called PROGRESS. What's the point of keep releasing albums which all sound the same?<br />So maybe Re-Load is not quite as heavy as Ride the Lightening but since when has heaviness been a synonym for quality.  <br />Both Load and Re-Load are amongst my favourite all time albums, they just grow and grow!  I never tire of them, they have intelligence, clever hooks and riffs, melody and variety.  There are slow songs, fast songs, melodic songs and heavier songs. To those who slate these two albums I say this...Expand your mind, don't be so blinkered, enjoy a band at the peak of their creativity.
B00005JLWN|5.0|I read some of these negative reviews, and I question the intelligence of the people who wrote them.  Some say this movie is a rip off of things like Fahrenheit 451, and metropolis.  While in actuality it's a retelling of the story.  It goes like this.<br />In the future, mankind has suffered a third world war.  Knowing that mankind would not survive a fourth, a policy is introduced to curb human emotion so that humans will no longer feel any of the extreme emotions which typically lead to violent conflict.  Or as the movie says, \\"at the cost of the soaring high's, we cut off the plummeting lows.\\"  Now, people who don't take their mandatory emotion depressing drug are labeled \\"sense offenders\\" and are either summarily executed on the spot, or taken back to the city to be incinerated.<br />The people leading this fight against the priests are the Tetra Gramaton Clerics.  These clerics have spent years mastering a style called the \\"gun kata\\".  The gun kata is derived from having analyzed thousands of gun fights, and then using mathematical probability to increase lethality of the person using it, while minimizing the clerics chance to be hit.<br />I found the story very compelling as it shows the underlying lesson that without emotion, we aren't really human, as it's the emotion that defines us as human.  I highly recommend this movie, and think that almost everyone should see it once with an open mind.
B000000WJZ|4.0|I sometimes wonder if whether Simese Dream of Mellon Colli and The Infinite Sadness is the best Smashing Pumpkins greatest achievement.  At the time of this review I'd have to say that I'm leaning a bit towards MCIS.  Supposedly frontman Billy Corgan played every instrument on the album except percussion.  Yet he still put all four members names on the final product's credits.  To be brief the Pumpkins were no more than Corgan and drummer Chamberlain with two backup musicians.  Why do I say this may you ask, because Corgan's guitar skills were almost unrivaled in the mid nineties and Chamberlain was one of the most prominent power drummers of the alternative genre.  I believe Corgan named the band Smashing Pumpkins instead of something like The Corgan Experience simply because it sounded cool, not because it was actually a group. <br />Now onto the cd.  The greatest thing about this album is how clear and epic it sounds instead of the muddy post grunge bands at the time.  The album starts off with Cherub Rock which must be the most famous alternative track of theirs on radio today.  The guitar work is truly amazing on this track.  The single Today is one of thost tracks that deepressed teenagers probably put on some upbeat mix tape to brightene up their day.  This is also a great track.  My favorite track on the album, however, would have to be Disarm.  The violin fits in perfectly with the song and it creates a sonic, somehow sad song.  The album showcases to top notch musicians, Corgan and Chamberlain.  Other fine examples of their talents include the songs Mayonaise, Rocket, and Spaceboy.  The first two are great rockers, and the latter is an excellent ballad.  All in all this is a great album but for some reason it is not something I put on all the time.  To be blunt, if you want one of the top ninties's album this would be a fine choice.
B00008OWZC|5.0|i have been an admirer of led zep for a number of years. of course this reviewer was not old enough to attend even their last shining performance as band in Knebworth ('79). i can tell you that word of mouth is just as good advertising as any other marketing tool. its been said that no other band can match the raw energy that these boys radiated on the stage. the thing about this band was that its beginnings were rooted in the blues and from that starting point jimmy page (their leader) mutated their sound into an aural event that no one has heard since. the band tended to have critics and the like judge their music by their performances. some bands even with all of the studio trickery that can be achieved today can not put together anything close to the magnitude in which zeppelin albums were formulated let alone their live performances. this band was meant to be heard live and in no other atmosphere. we have the good fortune with \\"how the west was won\\" to learn and appreciate the many styles each member represented and brought to the table. they could have been accused of becoming a little more aor with their last full release \\"in through the out door\\" (released just a short year before bonzo's death) but this set catches them at the peak of their creative powers. their style is in many ways copied and they launched a sound for millions of other bands to imitate and use as a blueprint for their own creative direction. <BR>its just a feeling of relief to know that even 35 years plus after their inception that they have the top slot in the billboard charts and that fans continue to enjoy their music and that new fans are being discovered every day. bands with something to prove should sit up and take notice and thank their lucky stars that led zeppelin ever existed. i think the thing which most impresses me about this recording is the quality (30 years considering) and the amazing intensity with which these four stellar musicians perform because first and foremost thats what they were, musical virtuosos. being in the top slot over bands like staind, linkin park and even eminem is all the proof you need to know that these guys were/are the real deal. the dvd collection is probably on par with the stones' \\"gimme shelter\\" or dylans \\"dont look back\\" and i would highly recommend it to not only the diehard or casual zeppelin fan but the individual with the ability to appreciate good old fashioned rock n' roll.<br />lighters up to an unparalleled legacy!
B00005OWEG|5.0|I saw original in theater when released years ago.  This uncut version has surprises around every corner... Like seeing a whole new film
B00007BHOE|5.0|This is the greatest music DVD ever.Slipknot has been one of my favorite bands for a while now and I've been waiting for something to watch besides \\"Welcome to our neighborhood\\" The first disk is awesome! It opens with some carnival music and shows shots of the band signing autographs, warming up etc. Then it cuts a shot of the stage. You can hear the introductory (515) playing. The lights are going crazy. Then the screaming of (515) comes to  sudden stop. you see Jim Root play the opening riff to people ...  and it's just chaos. That's an awesome moment. I am the owner of a number of concert DVDs and this is the only one that actually makes you feel like you're there.Slipknot is total chaos live. The thing they do during \\"Spit it Out\\" where everyone gets down on the ground then jumps up is crazy. The second disk is also very cool.It has all the bands videos to date(all of which rock). The \\"Wait and Bleed\\" animated version is cool. The multi- angle feature is not as great as people make it out to be. You don't really need it all. Overall it's a great buy, and I would reccommend it to any Slipknot fan, or any general metal fan. This is what it's all about!
B000002U9E|5.0|This is still one of my favourite albums of all times. It's a complete masterpiece. Profoundly moving. It will move anybody. The more you listen; and get all the layers, you will be awakened. Thank you Kate for this incredible, beautiful album. It is NOT to be missed!
B00003CX5P|3.0|Star Wars Episode 1 is a discrase to the whole set of movies.Not only is there bad acting but there are [weak] vilans, I also thought it could have been better with a better Anakin, not the kid in Jingle all the Way, he's just a bad actor.I also thought Obi-Wan could have been better, Liam Neeson was good in that as Qui-Gon.Natalie Portman was also a good princes Ammidala.<br />  This was actually pretty good but it was a Star Wars movie and they are  <BR>always supposed to be grade A, not B.The Pod race was pretty cool but that was about it, this movie was more of a heartbreaker and not action.George Lucas probably got this done over the weekend.That's poor.<br />  Now I have to talk about the DVD.It's alright but it's no Termanator metal box special edition, obviously.<br />  Ok, if you really like Star Wars I would get it but if your not a hardcore Star Wars fan, rent it.
B000002H6C|5.0|Amazing Album second of theres only too Ride The Lightning<br />Massivly Underated unfortantly , Blackened is no doubt the best track on this album , and yes the production is horrible but doesnt ruin it all too much . <BR>so buy this album and other metallica albums and anything from Radiohead
B00003CXA6|5.0|This was a great war movie.  It had everything a good movie should have.  Good dialogue, good storyline and obviously good action sequences.  Unlike many movies based on historical events this one stays fairly close to actual events.  I know I wasn't there but I am well read on the subject.  The movie is a bit long but if you have a rainy afternoon it is the perfect movie.<br />The DVD is also fairly well put together.  A good amount of extras, the best being the documentary on the making of the movie.  One of the best things about this movie as a whole is that all the extra were reenactors which whether or not you bellieve it or not just about guarantees accuracy.
B00006879E|5.0|You gotta love these talented, good looking guys! They ROCK! And if you havent yet had a chance to hear their music! I and many people out there really suggest you buy the CD....let me tell you....you WONT be disappointed! I guarentee it, I sure wasnt! Oh, and if you like the album...you should definantely go and see one of their concerts! I did! And boy did it rock! I LOVE EM!
B0000931OG|4.0|After collaborating with Dan the Automator and Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett on 2001's brilliant Gorillaz project, many wondered if that was the end for Damon Albarn's other band Blur. After garnering worldwide success in the 90's with quintessentially British rock/pop, the Gorillaz seemed like an interesting departure, and with it's success seemed like a death blow to Blur. But the group decided to return this year with a surprisingly less British sound. With a good portion of the album recorded in Morocco, world textures have found their way into their music. Some credit their more subtle sound to founding member Graham Coxen leaving the band in the process of recording the album, and there is a noticeable difference in their sound, but this could also be attributed to Albarn's evolving musical leanings.<br /><br />Highlights of the album include the album opener \\"Ambulance\\", the brilliant \\"On the Way to the Club\\" (don't let the title fool you) and the William Orbit collaboration \\"Sweet Song\\". The group's chosen venue also influenced songs on the album, finding it's way into songs like \\"Moroccan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Cub\\", and \\"Caravan\\". The album has only one but highly visible low point, the uninspiring \\"Crazy Beat\\", which sounds a little to much like you know what, and just overall lacks creativity, sounding completely out of place on the album.<br /><br />While the Gorillaz may some fans Blur doesn't, this album shows that this group has the capacity to evolve, and show artistic sentiments just as interesting. This is a solid album that will definitely satisfy Blur's fans, and pacify fans waiting on the next Gorillaz album.
B00008NG5V|4.0|I just got done listening to Mr. Johnson's latest effort and it should be noted that the album was recorded in Hawaii which must allow Mr. Johnson to surf after recording a very nice follow up album to Brushfire Fairytales (see my review for more information on what he sounds like if you haven't heard him before).<br />I really love the new album.  And while I could write about how it sounds like the last one, is a great listen, and makes me want to pick up my accoustic (i already told of this with the first album).  <br />So whats new and to love about this album:  Take the song &quot;Cocoon&quot;  A beautiful track both musically and vocally, the song is one of the more reflective songs on the album but shows that Jack Johnson has a sensitivity and ability to sing from the soul.  While I was hoping for a more soulful album, this album is an excellent counterpart to his first effort and will launch him into the stratosphere with listeners from all walks of life.<br />Horizon has been Defeated is another example of how the lyrics are getting much more poetic, speaking of how as we get older the &quot;horizon&quot; begins to &quot;Faaade.&quot;<br />So pick it up, put it in, and enjoy.
B000066NW0|4.0|i think this cD is very impressive but, they play her songs all the time and i mean we all know she is a  poser. yea, so um...i like all the songs and think they're gr8 but they play complicate sk8er boi and losing grip all the time when there are other songs that rock way more. u should totally buy it, it is worth it
6304698690|5.0|This film is excellently directed and gives the original story the extra grace. I read the story when I was a little boy. The garden remains mysterious to me. Now I am glad to find the garden in this film though a bit different from what I had expected. Art directing is stellar. From the onset of Indian landscape to vividness of the garden I had been awestruck.<br />Children actors are super as well. And supporting actors particularly Maggie Smith as the strict servant create the mood of the story well. A bit of unconvincing part is Mary's cousin Colin being too quick to walk briskly. Overall excellent artwork and directing overcedes the minor things. The use of guiding robin is also nice. And the garden is beautiful and the process of rebooming is nicely described. This should not be limited to children. Adults need such heartwarming story.
B0000033IR|5.0|You'll find a whole slew of her biggest hits in this set (&quot;Chain Of Fools&quot;, &quot;Natural Woman&quot;, &quot;Since You've Been Gone&quot;), as well as some alternate versions of them not found on the original release, but one of the best tracks on the album is Aretha's cover of the Rascals' hit &quot;Groovin'&quot;.  While I'm not big on cover songs, this one is SUPERIOR.  Aretha sings it to perfection!
B00000AFWZ|5.0|What most reviews miss is that these are ALL american bands.  There are about 20 excellent cuts, the rest are sound alikes.  Its worth every penny for those 20 songs.  All drummers should note, for example, the awesome drumming on Talk Talk, it makes the song.  These bands were made up of mostly traditionaly trained musicians, who discovered band music from first the AM radio and then freeform FM radio.  I beleive that the vietnam war and draft put a big hole in the developement of these american bands into more than 1 hit wonders.  The brits had no draft, no involvment in nam, they invaded the US with music.  This excellent music, like Woodstock, could have happened only America, only at that time in history.  Never to be repeated again.
0743201140|5.0|I read the book in 3 days!  Fascinating new approach into human interaction.  A whole new way for people to relate to others and mostly to understand their own strengths.  The concept of themes is fascinating and the StrengthsFinder test has helped me understand why I am drawn to certain tasks - not for the task itself, but for the underlying talent I am able to use, develop and master. <br />As I read through all the 34 themes, I started to see those around me in a whole new way - all a sudden their behavior and quirks started making sense!  Talents and strengths started emerging and with the help of the section on how to manage people by theme, I can now improve my interaction with others - even in a non-business setting.<br />This book will not tell you which job or field to choose, however, by knowing your major themes, it is easier to choose something that is in-line with your true self.  With this strength-based concept, interpersonal relations as a whole are tremendously enhanced, not to mention the potential for more effective human management within corporations.  <br />Overall, an excellent and fascinating read, and a wonderful self-knowledge tool.
B00005JL1C|5.0|I saw this movie on TNT a couple of weeks ago,I gotta admit I  really liked this movie a lot.This teen movie is real good especially with a good cast,good story and good acting.I give it  a 8/10 rate
B00008PC2O|4.0|It's pretty obvious that with the looming release of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in July, this new edition release of Terminator 2 on DVD is pretty much a money making ploy by Artisan to cash in.  All that aside (and despite the constant comparisons between this and the previously released Ultimate Edition), this Extreme DVD isn't all that bad.  The new commentary by James Cameron and William Wisher is interesting to hear and I find much better than the pre-recorded and overlapping one found in the Ultimate Edition DVD.  The picture and sound are unbelieveable; never before have I seen or heard the film in such rich picture and sound quality.  The other special features however, are absolutely not worth owning if you already have the previously released Ultimate Edition.  Besides the two featurettes, you get to watch the extended version of the film on Disc 1, and the theatrical version on Disc 2 if you have a DVD-Rom drive in your computer.  Plenty of other special features like those featured in the Ultimate Edition DVD would have been more than welcome here, especially if you missed out on owning the aforementioned DVD.  As we all know, the film itself is an action/sci-fi classic that set the standard for modern day computer generated special effects and continued a complex yet compelling storyline.  All in all, if you did miss out on the Ultimate Edition of Terminator 2, this Extreme DVD edition is worth picking up, but if you already own the Ultimate Edition stick with it.
6305922756|5.0|This movie is perfect. Great acting, great writing (and improv), and laugh-out-loud comedy. The DVD is excellent. The picture is perfect, the sound mix is great, and there is enough deleted material to almost double the length of the film. You can't go wrong here.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|Well Well. yes TATU. Which by the way I still do not know if that means anything in particular. Anyways. I checked them out because of yes the hype and I thought All the things she said was very very catchy. Many of my friends also said they were good. So i finally succumbed to the powers.<br />Really this album is good overall. Most songs are ok..while others are very bad or very good. I feel that the 2 singles \\"All the things she said\\" and \\"Not gonna Get us\\" are probably the only two outstanding tracks. The rest is verging on weird and hardly understandable. I think the album is also a little incomplete..like they possibly could have added more. Their singing talents are not bad actually I do like their voices. But sometimes I cannot understand them and feel like they need more lessons in english.<br />I would imagine the Russian version is better, As of the two songs in Russian on the CD they sound more comfortable..and actually better. Overall..I would reccomend this CD, but only if you can buy it used or for a very good price. Also if you are tolerable to heavy dance and techno music.<br />And the lesbian thing. Who really cares..maybe it is part of the marketing scam, maybe it isn't. Who really knows and who cares? It should be about the music and that is how I reviewed this album.

B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus has imenses musical talent, and a general style that makes you want to listen to the cd over and over non-stop.  Their powerfull and moving lyrics over their great music makes me love them.  I dont think their is a band out theri that can match them, if you want to just kick back, chill and relax.  The only bands coming close I think are the Chili Peppers, Lifehouse or Eve 6, but talent wise, these guys win.
B00006CXXU|4.0|I like this album.  Heck, I own two copies of it (I bought one on vacation but left it with a friend, and could not wait the 2 months for her to bring it back to me when next we meet.).  I hated Genie in a Bottle...don't know why...I hated the whole teen-diva competition thing, and Ms. Aguilera's first album seemed more like an attempt to enter that field rather than explore and showcase the talent that she showed in Mulan.  Anyhoo, I could not stand her.  Then some things happened...I heard that song from Moulin Rouge, I looked beyond all the pointless media coverage of \\"she wore THIS, she fought with THIS guy...blah blah blah\\" and I was sitting down in front of MTV or VH1 (whatever) for the premiere of her Dirrty video.  Hey!  Here was a catchy tune!  Here was a lady who said \\"ok sod this, I'm going to do what I want.\\"  Do what I want...rebel...that can mean a lot of things...these days a girl can stick her tongue out, or give the finger to cameras, and she is a \\"rebel\\" or an \\"individual.\\"  Well, that is just lame.  I did not see that lameness here - only a risky creativity.<BR>Fast forward.  I saw Saturday Night Live, where Ms. Aguilera performed \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Fighter.\\"  Wow!  3 good songs that sounded nothing alike!  3 songs I wanted to hear again.  Fast forward some more - my brother was playing an XBox game with \\"Come on Over\\" on it.  Ok, that is from her old album, but it is dang catchy anyway.  <BR>Fast forward some more...I bought the album, expecting to have 3 good tracks (the ones I mentioned) and a bunch of hip hop crud filler, which is par for the course these days.  WRONG.  This is a decent album.  Very decent.  It's got a track for every mood I might be in!  <BR>Now, the idea of \\"creative\\" versus \\"catchy.\\"  Sometimes people pour their hearts and souls into an album and well, the album sucks.  Why?  Because the listening audience is not inside the artist's head, so the material comes out like self-indulging trash.  This album is creative, yes.  Butone can tell from a first listen that Ms. Aguilera is not just indulging herself - she must have at least asked one or two people \\"come on...be honest...what do you think of this track?\\"  I like that.  The last time I had such positive things to say about the creativity and listenability of an album was....hmm....\\"She\\" by Harry Connick Jr.  <BR>I am looking forward to listening to this CD a lot.  So, why do I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars?  Here is why.<BR>1) The order.  I cannot put this CD in my player to wake me up in the morning, because the first track is not so good for that.<BR>2)  I have to go back and check, but I think they extended the rap section in \\"Dirrty\\" over the video version.  Maybe I am wrong...but the rap section in this song on the album seems too extended and almost kills the momentum of the song.  <BR>3) Lil' Kim sucks, so I skip her track.<br />So that's it!  Ms. Aguilera, if you read these reviews, you have a new fan.  (Well, if you DONT, you have a new fan, but you get the idea.)  <br />I await the next album, if it is as creative and listenable as this one.<br />That's it.
B00000IMCW|4.0|This film is definitely one of the greatest horror films ever made.  Many horror buffs already know the movie but here is a quick synopsis.  Four people find that the country is being overrun by zombies.  They find themselves a helicopter and end up taking cover in a shopping mall.  However they then find themselves surrounded by those zombies who are still in the mall.  The typical blood and guts ensues and eventually our heroes take control of the mall.  This is where Romero uses brains and intelligence in the film.  By having the characters run around taking anything they find he is showing the &quot;consumer side&quot; of people even in the darkest times.  The movie ends when two characters remain and escape the mall after more zombies have been let in by a biker gang.  Definitely a great film.  Hopefully a new DVD comes out soon which showcases some great special features.  This film deserves that treatment.
0792164903|5.0|Great production values, fun plotline, exciting action, and good acting.  <br />What more could you ask?  How about a genuinely creepy atmosphere?  Fabulous editing?  Good sound?  <br />This film really captures the spirit of Halloween - the feeling is really expressed with a well-placed line early in the film:<br />&quot;You're a long way from New York, constable.&quot;<br />  T
B00005JLRT|1.0|This bleak and dreary film lacks everything enjoyable about my all-time favorite series and left me with a dull ache in my belly.  Aside from the brief wedding scene there is no warmth, no humor, no interesting locales or character interaction and the villian, who seems to have three-fourths of the film's dialogue, is neither menacing nor interesting, just an arrogant jerk.  I wanted more Worf and Riker!!!  There was a lot of action, but it amounted to nothing more than a prolonged space battle differing from episdodes only in that it was much louder and considerably longer.  In contrast to the exotic and colorful settings of the Star Wars films, the masterful action sequences of the Matrix, and the dynamic characters and villians of the X-Men, this dead in the water bomb makes Star Trek look tired, uninspired and down for the count.  I am praying for a miracle . . .
B00006FDCD|2.0|All right, after having watched this again this weekend, I've come to the conclusion that it just isn't that good.  There is a lot of good lead-up, and even some good creepy moments during the first half.  However, there just isn't enough background to understand the overall take of the movie.  I found the ending was both abrupt and unclear.<br />If this had been given the full mini-series treatment that \\"The Stand\\" received, it probably would have equalled it in quality (which was pretty good).  However, this film was just too short to give adequate coverage of the story.  If we'd seen more and longer details of the childrens' lives, it might have made more sense in the overall scheme of things - instead we get memory moments for each of them which are fleeting and not very descriptive.  They only serve to say \\"This happened back then,\\" rather than giving you a true feeling of what exactly went wrong.  <br />Tim Curry was good, but because no one really is given enough time to expand a character, his evil clown act comes off as being angry and stupid rather than creepy and threatening.  <br />I can't really say that this is worth buying.  If you're a die-hard SK fan and you are curious, rent it.  Otherwise, you're better off with another choice.  Like The Stand.<br /> T
B000066NW0|5.0|This album rulz, because when she sings Sk8ter Boi, it's like she knows me personally. Oh and the song Complicated, cuz my life is like really complicated.  But the real reason this album rocks my world is because I want to nail Avril Lavigne. Hard.  Whether she is punk or not is immaterial because she is super hot, and that makes for some spicy TV.  So people, lay off the poor girl, because I really want to lay on top of her. Yup, that's about it.
B00005JKG7|3.0|This film was produced before producers got into limb-flinging, and it still has a sense of plot that escaped most directors in the 80's and 90's.  Much of the action is audio - you aren't privy to whatever horrible deaths are taking place, and Carpenter leaves it to your imagination.<br />The only reason I give this a three, and not a four, is simply because the film is dated - and this, to some degree, detracts from the film.  For example, the presence of a cell phone would have solved much of the difficulty in a crucial section of the film.  If you can overlook that sort of thing, you'll probably rate it higher than I did.  Overall, it's a great thrill, with fun effects and a scary plotline.  Here's something that you don't get in many, if any, horror movies these days:  SUBTLETY.  <br />Carpenter has always been a hit-or-miss director for me (one example of a miss:  \\"Ghosts of Mars\\"), and this is a solid hit.  <br />  T
B00005AQGH|5.0|This has to be one of the best albums I've ever heard. \\"Hail Mary\\" is a classic rap song and is the best track on this cd.<BR>This was the last CD released while Tupac was alive, and is his best. I give this my highest reccomendations to anyone who likes music at all.
B00005RYL9|4.0|While having a rather short plotline, this film exploits every angle it can take with it.  You might be turned off by the description on the back cover, which comes off sounding like a B-class flick.  That impression is misleading - the cinematography, filming quality, and even acting (normally not something you'd compliment Lambert on) are GREAT.  <br />The soundtrack is obviously 80's (read:  all Queen), but that's still fun.  Clancy Brown really shines in his role here, and Sean Connery adds a distinguished note that really seals the film up well.  <br />This is a fun one. ...  <br />  T
0671799320|5.0|I decided to pick up this book because I wanted to know how influential oil was as a factor in international politics. In the run-up to Operation Iraqi Freedom, many protestors held signs saying &quot;No blood for Oil.&quot; Was the war all about oil?? I decided to find out. I was told by many that this was a definitive account of the role of oil in world politics and a good place to start...<br />Not only was it a great history lesson, it was an absolute page turner!! You wouldn't think a history of the oil industry could be gripping, but his depiction of the characters, world leaders and crucial decisions of the 20th century was compulsive reading.<br />Clearly, as Yergin points out, oil is a VERY strong, motivating factor behind many geo-political issues...<br />Absolutely brilliant. I feel that I am a more enlightened person for having read this book. It should be required reading for all students of history...
B00008OWZC|5.0|I have a half-dozen bootleg albums of Led Zeppelin concerts from the mid-1970s salted away somewhere, which means that when it comes to listening to the group in live performance the sound on &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is actually a step up.  But even if your experience to Led Zeppelin live is limited to the soundtrack for &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; you can still appreciate the way the group refused to simply get up on stage and play their songs the way they appeared on their albums.  &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; and &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; were always an opportunity to indulge in the wide variety of musical forms that had inspire Jimmy Page and Robert Plant.  This is why when you listen to the former you find John Lee Hooker's &quot;Boggie Chillun,&quot; Jerry Leiber's &quot;Let's Have a Party,&quot; Gene Pitney's &quot;Hello Marylou,&quot; and James B. Oden's &quot;Going Down Slow&quot; into the mix.  But during the later Led Zep would reference its own work, both known (&quot;The Crunge&quot;) and unknown (&quot;Walter's Walk&quot;).  Both &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Bring It On Home&quot; are extended in similar ways as well, playing to the group's strengths.<br />The tracks are taken from two concerts, recorded two days apart, in June of 1972.  The order of the 18 tracks follows the set list for those two concerts, with the only omission from both concerts being &quot;Tangerine&quot; from the acoustic set that ends Disc 1 (Disc 3 has half of the encore material from the L.A. gig, which apparently went on much longer than the one in Long Beach, including &quot;Louie Louie,&quot; &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;).  The bottom line is that &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; is one of those albums where the fact that it has previously unreleased live Led Zeppelin music is enough to make you decide whether or not you want to pick it up, even if you already have any of the bootlegs that exist (I have one of 1973 Forum concert that was Bonzo's 25th birthday, but that is not this one).  Even when you are aware of the similarities between some of the songs that are on both this album and &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; there are always some significant differences that makes you appreciate the way Led Zep usually made their songs extended jam sessions.  Besides, you get a version of the one song that is in the concert film of \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" but not on the album, \\"Since I've Been Loving You,\\" which is a Led Zeppelin blues classic that I never thought got the credit it deserved.1973 Forum concert that was Bonzo's 25th birthday, but that is not this one).

B00005JKJA|1.0|Although I got it, understood it and I got the message - this is the worst movie I've ever had the displeasure of watching (dare I say enduring?). The movie is extremly annoying, the directing style made me sick. The acting was stiff and inconvincing. <br /> Don't waste your time and money!!<br />I almost fell asleep. I was walking around the house doing other stuff, coming back 20 minutes later - and didn't miss a thing. The director showed his habbit of filming odd corners of appartments for long tedious minutes while nothing happens. The soundtrack made you want to bang your head against the wall and ask &quot;Why, oh why&quot;.<br />If your a twin pix fan - that's right up your ally. That's the only positive thing I would say. I could recommend you go watch &quot;The man who wasn't there.&quot; It's as pointless and long as this movie was.<br />Anyone wonders why this movie never got an Oscar for anything? The audience should recieve one for indurance. Who ever spent his money on producing this?<br />I am doing this movie a good deed, a true favor, by not writing all that I think of it. My true opinion would take too many pages to write... and no-one would read it. I don't know how can anyone recommend this film to film lovers. I am truly dizzy and shaking with disgust as I have just finished watching it.<br />2 Thumbs way - way - way down. Just DONT!
B000002H6C|5.0|Despite the poor production on And Justice for All, this stands out as Metallica's most complex album, and my personal favorite from the band.  Most of the songs on And Justice for All are extremely long, but thats certainly not a bad thing when when you're dealing with Metallica.  All the songs go through elaborate stages, changing up the tempo & mood constantly.  It's very impressive just to sit back & listen to.  Whether they're playing speed-metal, pounding you with some slow steady riffs, throwing in some acoustic parts, or going off on a classic, thrashy guitar solo, its all done very well on And Justice for All.  This album has an epic vibe to it, and it has two of the best songs ever written by the band.  There's \\"One\\" or course, widely considered to be the bands best song, and then there's \\"To Live is to Die\\", an emotional instrumental tribute to Cliff Burton.  That song is simply breathtaking.  The rest of the album is outstanding as well.  James's lyrics on this album are  the most meaningful he's ever written, shouting out against various injustices concerning the government.  This is also the band's most passionate & angry album as well, as they vent from pain & sorrow of losing their close friend & bass player Cliff Burton.  While Master of Puppets overall may be considered Metallica's best album, personally I like And Justice for All more because of its raw & angry sound.  Its much less polished than Master of Puppets & plus its has \\"One\\" & \\"To Live is to Die\\" which are my two favorite Metallica songs.  So you can complain about the poor production & nearly inaudible bass on And Justice for All, but Metallica fans cannot deny that the actual music on the album is among the band's most experimental, progressive, & best work.
B000021YQV|5.0|I love this album, it has to be one of my favorite albums in my collection. Any time i hear toxicity or Chop Suey on the radio its stuck in my head all day. Any of the songs for that matter. If you love their first album you will love this one for sure. Be sure to check out Steal this album out too.
0440224764|4.0|Grisham handles this story with characteristic strength and vividness and winds it up with a disappointing and ineffective ending, which is, unfortunately, becoming equally characteristic.<br />Patrick Lanigan, bilks his law firm out of an exorbitant amount of money, then races away from his unhappy life an even unhappier marriage with gazillions of dollars to hide himself in the wilds of Brazil.  With the foresight and calculation that are the hallmarks of any self-respecting Grisham hero, Lanigan plans and plots to avoid detection and punishment for his behavior and formulates a plan to hide the money should anything happen to him -- which it does, of course, when he's caught by parties interested in reclaiming their money and figuring out the particulars of his escape.<br />Lanigan is an interesting hero, one who reveals information on his own time schedule, not the schedule of his fellow characters or the schedule of his audience.  This strategy makes for compelling storytelling.  It's fascinating to watch this particular yarn unravel, and the characters in Lanigan's life -- his barracuda of an ex-wife, his mysterious and exotic Brazilian co-conspirator, his good-ole-boy American former friends, the ruthless snakes out to make Lanigan suffer to achieve their own ends -- create a sense of immediacy and intrigue since they're just as interesting as Lanigan himself.<br />While the majority of the book is terrific, the end (which occurs suddenly within a few pages) is a real letdown.  Despite its brevity, the end was enough of a disappointment for me to revoke a star.  When you read the story, write me and let me know if you agree!

B00004VVNB|4.0|Less than a year before &quot;Star Wars&quot; hit the box-office, &quot;Logan's Run&quot; hit the screens as a bright and highly entertaining sci-fi yarn that starred Michael York and Jenny Agutter.  While it wasn't the hit like &quot;Star Wars&quot; came to be, &quot;Logan's Run&quot; still fared well and is now considered a cult classic.<br />I have never read the novel, but I must say I was intrigued by the film.  A great, thought provoking story about how humans had to retreat to domes because of ecological disaster and overpopulation.  The story takes another viewing to get the jist of, but it's a great story.  Reading other reviews, people have pointed out that the first half is far better; while I agree that the film is good on the whole, the second half was what drew me to the film, especially when they discover Washington, D.C. in ruins (WOW, great production design!).<br />Peter Ustinov has a co-starring role as the Old Man they find at the D.C. ruins and he's probably the most remarkable actor here.  His lines, primarily taken from one of T.S. Elliot's poems, often raise an eyebrow and are quite humorous.  Richard Jordan is almost menacing as Logan's pursuer and best friend, Francis 7.  Michael York (Basil!!) does a fine job as Logan 5, a sandman who decides to run because he yearns to live past 30 and make a difference.<br />The production designs and the visual effects are nothing to scoff at either, considering the time period.  Ok, so the pastel costume colors are 70ish, but who cares.  The visual scope of the film is grand, and you can tell director Michael Anderson was perfect for the job.<br />Finally, before I conclude this review, I must also commend Jerry Goldsmith for his electronic score.  This score often goes unregarded in this prolific composer's career, but I must say that it was a bold experiment into electronics.  He composed yet another great score in his career.<br />Overall, if you can get past the 70s bright colors, this film is a treat.  A great sci-fi flick.  Don't miss out.eat.  A great sci-fi flick.  Don't miss out.

B00005QG9J|5.0|this CD is top notch, incubus at their best. i wasn't sure if they could top Make Yourself, but they did. barely. make yourself was incredible as well. unlike most loyal incubus fans, i am not crazy about their first two albums, fungus amongus and s.c.i.e.n.c.e. . their funkiness back then doesn't do much for me. but i am a huge fan of the newer, more mature incubus music. they are among my favorite artists/bands. so...go by the CD.
B0000844I8|5.0|First off, once you get past the idea of a Stargate the rest kind of falls into place.  The government, with the help of Professor Daniel Jackson (James Spader), figures out how to work it.  Pro. Jackson, with an escort of soliders led by Colonel Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) step through it to the other side.<br />They find a desert planet where humans are being made to mine for the same material that the gate was made from.<br />The people are Egyptians who were removed from Earth over 10,000 years ago, by an alien, and even Daniel Jackson can't understand their language because living languages CHANGE.<br />The movie is careful to stay away from many of the cliches of most sci-fi movies but also stays away from having characters which are TOO simple.  Both Daniel and Jack (played by James and Kurt) are real people, not cardboard cut-outs, with all the flaws and merits of our own reality.  The natives are catch between trying to be friendly towards strangers AND not pissing off their Gods.<br />The science and technology used by Ra and his men look very sleek and very real.  From the spaceship to the gliders, everything has a touch of old Egyptian myth mixed with advanced alien know-how.<br />The DVD comes with two versions of the movie, Director's Cut and the theatrical cut, in which the former has audio commentary.  The DVDs also have a great 'Making of Stargate' featurette, a 'Is There a Stargate?' short starring Erich von Daniken himself, trailers, scane access, crew and cast information and production notes.<br />Everything you could want in a DVD set, a mixture of sound science fiction, a touch of great effects and the pinch of old fashion adventure.  This is a great pop corn flick.  Enjoy!
B00004RF97|5.0|I borrowed his from a friend.  plan to get my own version, this is classic fun and enjoyment.  Grant and Hepburn are wonderful together, they play off one another so spendidly as former spouses whom, like all former spouses, try to dislike one another.  We find out that Cary's character is being blackmailed to get reporters iinto the high society wedding, but the blackmailing but he is trying to protect his former spouses family. Could he still have feelings for his 'Red'?  I love Stewart in his boy next door type role, he the writer, turned reporter so he can have food on his table  and roof to cover that table.  Virginia Weidel, not sure that is spelled correctly, is fun to watch as the kid sister of Hepburn's character who wants more than anything for her sister not to marry George Kittredge.  Buy it, or at least rent it then decide to buy it.  You shall be glad you did.  I am also happy it is in black and white.  Yes, there are cetian points, moments of graininess, but it is  b&amp;w, things one can over look when the movie as entertaining as &quot;Philidelphia Story&quot; proves to be, over and over again.
B00005JL78|5.0|Talk about a action-packed sci-fi with brains, \\"Minority Report\\" is an incredible movie that combines sci-fi with elements of film noir.  It's one of those films where you can enjoy it without being the biggest sci-fi enthusiast.  I've admit many times that I'm not the biggest sci-fi buff, but if there's a solid story behind it all, I'm there!  And this film has it all.<br />The movie is set in the future where murder is pre-determined.  That's right, now murders can be stopped before they ever happen.  It's called \\"Pre-Crime.\\"  It's based on a system involving \\"Pre-Cogs\\"  that can see the future and predict when somebody is going to murder someone.  It's supposed to be flawless.  But something goes wrong when the system targets one of their own, Detective John Anderton.  The Pre-Cogs have predicted that he will murder a man that he has never met before.  Now John is on the run, hoping to find out what's going on and if he's been set up, who is behind it all.  The deeper he searches the more twists and secrets come about.<br />Everything about this movie I love.  I love how dark and eerie of a movie it is!  I wasn't expecting that from Spielberg, being that I saw \\"AI\\" and thought that while it was a little dark I think he missed an opportunity to get even darker.  \\"Minority Report\\" is one of the darkest sci-fi films I have seen in a long time (since \\"Dark City\\").  And what I love about it all is that even with out-of-this-world special effects, the movie never loses focus on the story or the characters.<br />The script was absolutely superb.  I've never read the short story that the movie is based upon, but I have to admit I was in awe at every turn.  It has some great acting too.  Tom Cruise was perfect for the role.  Colin Farrell and Max Von Sydow were terrific as well.  Steven Spielberg doesn't miss a note in his directing and I think the movie could've gone wrong if it were in the hands of somebody else.  (I'm just grateful that George Lucas didn't get his hands on this one.)<br />A word of warning; I wouldn't recommend parents letting their little kids see this one.  It gets very dark and disturbing at times.  Don't let the PG-13 rating fool you for a second, I believe that it BARELY made PG-13.  Just a little warning from me.<br />The DVD contains a TON of extras that are bound to keep you happy.  The picture is great (some will complain that it looks all grainy, but that's exactly how it's supposed to look) and the sound is outstanding.  You get the chance to hear it in DTS if your system can play it.  Some of the extras are a bunch of documentaries on the special effects, behind the story and thought, stunts, locations, and a lot more.<br />\\"Minority Report\\" is an outstanding film that really does remind me of great dark sci-fi movies like \\"Blade Runner\\" and \\"Dark City.\\"  Combined with action, suspense, drama, and elements of film noir, this movie  proves to be a success on every front.

B000002AQQ|4.0|First of all, I am a huge fan of the movie and its music. I just watched it for the 10th time the other day for my Social Studies class in school and I wanted to find the soundtrack to buy it. I found it, but it has a lot of the best songs from the movie missing. I'm mad that it doesn't include Hendrix's All Along the Watchtower from the Vietnam helicopter scene and Hey Joe from the Black Panthers scene. Also, there are a few Doors songs missing. The soundtrack has Break On Through, but the movie also had Love Me Two Times, People Are Strange, Love Her Madly, Hello I Love You, Soul Kitchen, and I also think L.A. Woman was in there. Skynyrd's Free Bird should be in there from when Jenny tried to jump off that balcony, too. I think there were a few more CCR songs besides Fortunate Son. I didn't know 'On The Road Again' was on there. This soundtrack should be 3 or 4 discs with all of the songs from the movie. The current one is decent, so I give it 4 stars. The movie is one of my all-time favorites. I only cry when I see a truly moving movie and Forrest Gump was one of them. I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes. \\"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get.\\" - Forrest Gump
B00005NWM3|4.0|Since they are new, NickelBack still has room for improvment and growth into their own style (typical of new groups and nothing to guffaw at yet- give them a little time). I really love &quot;This is how you remind me&quot; and &quot;Too Bad&quot;. I dont normally listen to rock, but this is the music that got me started liking it. I think they have a good sound, and given a little time, they will come into their own and make a distinctive enough sound to become a great band. This is a good CD to buy.
0553573403|5.0|I think the series is great.  I am not sure why some people didn't like this book.  They complain a lot about the characters: what they are like and what happens to them.  Well, I thought the characters were very creative.  Everyone is working for a larger cause, but they all have their own ideas and ambitions, just as people do in real life.  This isn't a book with a main character that is all good fighting the all evil villian with all the armies mindlessly doing as they should.  All characters are complicated people that you try to figure out, but can never be certain.  Unexpected, yet truely believable, things happen to them, just as in the way things can happen to anyone in life.  I thought it was very real and well written.
B00004UEIF|5.0|The piano is a versatile instrument.  It can function as an accompanying instrument or as a leading instrument.  For the latter, there is no better album.<br />Evans' rendition of My Foolish Heart is one of the great moments of jazz history.  It opens the album superlatively.  The title track and Detour Ahead are both gems.  Everything on the record is stunning.  The late Scott LaFaro sounds more inspired than ever.<br />In regards to which you should buy first Waltz for Debby or Sunday at the Village Vanguard, obviously it is all subjective.  However, to make things maybe too simple, I will say this.  Sunday at the Village Vanguard (released first) has a greater focus on LaFaro's bass and writing than Waltz.  Waltz for Debby is just an inch stronger because the trio is presented more as a unit and less as a platform to feature each instrumentalist.  But truly they are both phenomenons of jazz history.  Easily the greatest records Evans ever made, and easily the greatest piano trio recordings ever made.  And most impressively, probably still the most astounding music ever recorded at the Vanguard, tied with Coltrane from the same year.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie was awesome...it picked up from where the last one left off and kept moving.  It was a lot more fast paced and the Wolverine story was played out to its fullest.  The intense action, little quips of humor, and great storytelling makes this movie a definite choice to watch.  I can barely wait until it comes out on DVD/VHS.  If you liked the first one I would definitely recommend the second one!!!  Great acting, directing, and kick [rear] special effects!!!!
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is a very good soundtrack, the best are 10 and 18

If you like fast paced, semi funny, keep you on your toes types of movies, this is one for you.  I highly recommend it....!!!!
0679720200|5.0|\\"The stranger(L'etranger)\\" is a story of someone <br />named, \\"Meursault\\", but at the same time of ourselves. I first <br />felt him strange, then gradually familiar with myself. This is <br />perhaps because he is not a real \\"stranger.\\"<br /> When Meursault's mother dies, his reactions are not what<br />other people expect from him, such as mourning or at least <br />weeping in front of the dead. However, he is too tired to <br />satisfy those expectations and smokes a cigarette,instead. <br />After that he meets his girlfriend, has sex with her, goes to <br />the beach and kills a guy due to the burning sun who is trying <br />to attack his companion. That's all. There isn't any evil <br />intention or hostile motive in his attitude.<br /> From my point of view, the most remarkable part of this book <br />is when Meursault looks at the sky and the moon through the <br />small hole in ceiling of the prison. According to him, he feels <br />the repletion full of happiness that he could never have <br />before, recollecting all the memories from the past. For the <br />short moment, he is freed from everything and everyone and <br />becomes the perfect sole. I would call this, the \\"Perfect <br />freedom.\\" <br /> A man made up of apathy,indifference, and selfishness is <br />Meursault. He is not interested in anything related to others <br />and doesn't try to turn their attention to him. That's why I <br />cannot hate him but synpathise with him. He is not a cruel <br />murderer,undutiful son,unfaithful lover or liar. All we need to <br />know about him while reading this book is to understand him as <br />the way he is. And then look at ourselves. There is not much <br />difference between him and us. He is our reflection and <br />representative of what we cannot easily express ouside. I would <br />rather be a \\"Meursault\\" than the judge or the jury. The <br />word, \\"Stranger\\" leads to the feeling of some rejection. People <br />usually call something strange if itis different or unfamiliar <br />with them. However, from the person's point of view they all <br />are the \\"Strangers.\\"
B000002MH5|3.0|this is an Ok cd... its definatly not as good as the older stuff by them... at this point, it was basically just J mascis doing everything, scince he got mad at lou barlow and hit him wiht his guitar.. that was obviously a dumb move, cuz lou really added to the band... there are some good tracks her, though, like the mystical &quot;out there&quot; and &quot;get me&quot; is a great song too. except for the annoying female vocals on the chorus... &quot;start choppin&quot; is an awsome song that sounds alot like third eye blind's &quot;semi charmed life&quot;... but if you want to pay for a few good songs and alot of filler, go ahead and buy this. but if you want an album that is jamm-packed wiht mind blowing dinosaur jr. tracks, get either their self-titled debut, or &quot;youre living all over me&quot;. &quot;bug&quot; is supposed to be good too, but i havnt heard it.
B00008DDSC|4.0|Don't let the subject matter scare you, folks! This is a beautiful movie.<br />Maggie Gyllenhaal is absolutely adorable and incredibly sexy as Lee Holloway, a young woman who is a cutter - someone who cuts herself to avoid inner pain, to feel she is alive, to take comfort in the pain itself and the healing. She has recently been released from a mental institution for attempted suicide, and is placed into the care of her amazingly dysfunctional family. She begins cutting herself again, until her new boss, E. Edward Grey (James Spader,) slowly brings her into a dominant/submissive relationship. Spader plays Grey perfectly, portraying some of the most genuine inner conflict I have ever seen on-screen. His intensity is unparalleled.<br />That's the short story right there, but until you see this film, you won't realie the intensity (there's that word again) of each character's awkwardness with her- or himself, won't release how necessary their relationship is to each of them, and how they come to feel about each other. The story is surprisingly funny and light-hearted both subtly and overtly in places, utterly charming in others, sad in several, and heart-warming overall. The direction is superb, the colors and sets are absolutely gorgeous and rich in color....everything about this film is stunning. It is not shocking, it is not pornographic, but it is sensual and sexual.<br />Lee's transformation is, of course, the focal point of the film, but there are other layers to appreciate and savor as well. This is an enjoyable ride that allows those unfamiliar with aspects of BDSM to see a tiny glimpse of two peoples' version of it, but it's also more than that. The \\"more than that\\" is really difficult to describe, I'm sorry. But it's a beautiful, tender love story, and I highly recommend it - I'll definitely watch it again.<br />The DVD's extra features are somewhat lacking, sadly, but the \\"Behind the Secretary\\" bit is fun. Despite the stereotypically dark subject matter, asthe \\"behind\\" bit states, she is actually travelling a journey from darkness into light - and that's absolutely it. Mr. Grey's office is a sanctuary where orchids grow, and where Lee begins to grow and blossom, too. The long shots down the hallway to his office underline the journey, and are beautiful unto themselves. It's simply a great, great story! Charming! Beautiful! Lovely! Stunning! Almost perfect! [grin]
0792842723|5.0|This movie is the best of the bond sega, regardless of who is playing 007. This is a serious movie with wisecrack remarks coming from Bonds is kept in check unlike Moonraker, the worse Bond movie ever. Hatcher as the main girl is sexy playing a russian level 2 programmer, whatever that means. The main villians happens to be a traitor among the agents of her majesty service, the queen. This led to possibly the best fighting scene in the end. I love the tank chase scene too, which edge out 'Live or Let Die' boat chase scene by a tick or two. The part with Bond holding Q's sandwich, which Q then says 'Don't touch that, its my lunch' is a classic. We will all miss Q, becuase it won't be the same again after seeing 'Live Another Day'. Halli Berry is hot but can't hold a candle to superboy's girlfiend.  <br />If your a 007 diehard fan or not, i highly recommend this viewing. I seen it more than any other Bond movie and once you see it, you will know why.
B00009NH5W|4.0|At long last this album sees the light of day commercially in the USA (it's been available on the internet and/or an import for about 2 years in varying forms.)  If you're only familiar with TTD (now Sananda Maitreya - loooong story) from &quot;Introducing the Hardline&quot;, this is a great starting point to get re-familiarized.  The album is TTD's usual effortless blend of rock, funk, soul, pop, and jazz.  As usual he writes, produces, and plays most of the instruments himself.  His voice is in amazing form throughout, from growling rock yelps to soaring falsetto crooning.  Standout tracks include the pop perfection of &quot;O Divina&quot; and &quot;My Dark Places&quot; as well as the jazzy ballad &quot;Shalom&quot;.  Unlike his previous three albums, there are no &quot;weird&quot; tracks that take several listens to get adjusted to - but for a fan like me, this feels like TTD is pulling his punches just a little bit - I'll take the weirdness, myself.  Still, for the diehard fan this definitely stands up to his previous work, and for the casual fan is the perfect reintroduction to the most overlooked musical genius of our time.
B000002LND|5.0|This is no doubt one of the best greatest hits album upto date , its even better than her new GHV2 <BR>I think her weaknest is trying to overedit all the songs to make it sound less long, but she didnt know that would upset some fan, some songs dont really need to be edited, For example:<BR>1 - HOLIDAY (4:05)<BR>    this song is desperately short! Madonna you should never skip the part \\"WE HAVE GOT TO GET TOGETHER\\" or \\"HOLIDAY CELEBRATION, COME TOGETHER, IN EVERYNATION\\"....at all! this edition would be perfect if she didnt skip those parts out!<br />2 - LUCKY STAR ( 3:37): This edition is fine! I have no complaints, it shoulndt be too long anyway, it's a little cute nice short song! <br />3 - BORDERLINE (4:00) Wat better can this be? It's the Video version, no way she would put the original version which is nearly 6 mins to the greatest hits collection, the video version is always the most acceptable one! the music accompaniment is also better too! great!!!<br />4 - LIKE A VIRGIN (3:10) This version is just nice enough, because some people complain about \\"wheres the end of it in the original version\\" , well , people, i have to say it was nothing just repeating the same beat, and the same lyrics, so why not make it shorter to fit in here !<br />5 - MATERIAL GIRL (3:50 ): Little nice short one! accompaniment is absolutely better the original, more unique, more upbeat, and also the end of it is not a fading one like the original, its good! <br />6 - CRAZY FOR  YOU (3:45) : Its fairly not a long sound song at all, why didnt you put the original version Madonna, its got the violin, oboe accompaniment better than this version<br />7 - INTO THE GROOVE: Absolute great, the most proper edit! with the piano part,....It didnt actually skip out any major part Absolutely great!<br />8 - LIVE TO TELL (5:08) Well this song is originally very long already, its sensible to edit it shorter! especially at the end when the chorus just repeats so many times, <br />9 - PAPA DON'T PREACH(4:10) : This is also a proper edit! The music sounds mmore \\"echo\\", its definitely better than the original one, also its got more vocal effect too.. for example  \\"WE ARE IN LOVE!!\\" which the original doesnt!!!<br />10 - OPEN YOUR HEART (3:50) Too , too short! I agree that the drum, the bass are edited to be less heavy, but this song was meant to sound like rock, the edition just ruins it all! also the ending is like rushing to fade!!! not a proper edit!!! disappointed.....I suggest the Video Version, you would realise that it sounds stronger!!! more Madonna characters than this one!!!<br />11 - LA ISLA BONITA (3:48): Okay actually this edition is really good, especially the drum and the bass are edited to sound smoother, less heavy, the echo effect also makes the guitar melody sound better!, but the thing is, Madonna skips the ending part, where she whispers in Spanish, which is just nto right, it disappoints me the most ....\\"LA LA LA LA LA,,,E KE TO TE AMOS.....LLALALALAL........\\", this part is replaced by the same chorus repeated 3 times till it fades out!!! MADONNA, why is there always something missing that you do, this song is just nearly perfect....but because of that!!!....wat can I say<br />12 - LIKE A PRAYER (5:50) Its nice to have the new remix verion in here!, but its a bit too long, it could have been edited shorter, the drum solo part in the middle is not so necessary!<br />13 - EXPRESS YOURSELF (4:04): Too short, this Shep Bettibone remix is good, this is the version that she sings in the Blond Ambition World Tour, If only it has the Trumpet instrument like the original , and the part \\"....WAT U NEED IS A BIG STRONG HAND...\\" before the last chorus !!!<br />14 - CHERISH (3:50) very good edit, sure it has a better sound, but it could be better if the last bit she did skiip out ..\\"CHERISH GIVE ME THING ,GIVE ME JOY...\\" its just too short at that part, why couldnt you make it like the original one, this is quite a short song!<br />15 - VOGUE (5:20) Well,maybe she wants to inspire audience more with this edit, It's fine, actually, but I JUST wonder why she skipped the \\"echo\\" efffect at that part...\\"YOU KNOW YOU YOU KNEW IT...\\" Otherwise its great!<br />The last two songs I have no comments since they were the new materials on this album.<br />GENERALLY THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY MADONNA FAN< EVEN IF YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL THE STUDIO ALBUMS, because some edit version in here are really good! ... dont just rely on the original version, some of them arent perfect compare to these edits, Anyway, Justitfy My Love and Rescue Me are worth buying anyway, A GREAT COLLECTION that you just cant skip out!!!<BR>BUY IT!
0060925000|5.0|My only criticism of Suitable Boy is that it's too short.  When I realized I was reaching the last 100 pages, I read slower.  <br />When I read this book, I had 2 toddlers and had to sneak into the laundry room to read it.  (I tend to associate Suitable Boy with my youngest sitting on my foot, pinching my leg.)  I mention this only to emphasize what a compelling story this was.  Even with constant interruptions and distractions, I was mesmerized.<br />Quite simply, one of the best reads I've had for decades.  I read Suitable Boy when it came out, and today still occasionally find myself chewing over the plot and characters. I wonder if Mira Nair or someone like her could do justice to it in a movie version?
B000089RVX|5.0|I love the way that Evanescence changes so easily from a rock song to a haunting melodic ballad.  Amy Lee's voice changes from a high, clear soprano to a low, scratchy humming.  My favorite song is 'My Immortal' partly because the music is so pretty, and partly because the lyrics are haunting.  I think anyone who likes music will find at least one song that they like a lot.
B00005MP58|5.0|Perfectly cast, wonderfully acted.  Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books, and this rendition of it is one of my favorite videos.
B00005JLWN|4.0|To a fan of dystopia literature, this movie is immediately familiar.  It's a (rather well done) blend of Kirosawa, The Matrix, and Ira Levin's novel, This Perfect Day.  The Levin novel, unfortunately out of print, is wonderful, but doesn't anticipate the gunslinger hero of the late nineties/early naughts.<br />If you liked this movie, stick around, there'll be more. Check out the early William Gibson novels (especially the original Neuromancer/Count Zero/Mona Lisa Overdrive trilogy and the collection Burning Chrome).  For a slightly lighter movie, try Split Second.
0385504209|2.0|A commercial success and rather fun in its way, but marred by technical blunders that tend to tarnish the author's image as an art-historian at play. For example, the Louvre is east of the Tuileries, not \\"west\\" as Brown has it (page 17). That's Paris 101. Yet somehow Brown gets us to the Louvre anyway, where he tells us that it would take an \\"estimated five days\\" for \\"a visitor to properly appreciate the 65,300 pieces of art\\" there (page 18). Thus a visitor would have about three seconds to \\"properly appreciate\\" each work of art. Wow. Later, Brown tells us that a scroll is a codex (199), whereas a codex is precisely what a scroll is NOT. Brown-or his copy-editor-misspells \\"ad nauseam\\" not once but twice (169, 247), which suggests that somebody doesn't know his Latin-which is a little hard to understand in a book about church-history. Similarly, Brown misspells Armand Hammer's name (300), which is downright inexplicable given Hammer's importance as a collector. While such blunders as these may detract from the author's credibility, they are unlikely to cost him much when it comes to selling the film rights-which is presumably what this book is all about.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The Pianist is a dark, grim movie that displays the horrors of the Holocaust and holds nothing back. This is how it should be. The brutal truths of illness, lonliness, suicide combine in what is ultimately the tale of a musician. Yes, he was a Jew, but first and formost he was a pianist. This is a movie that everyone should see and belongs in every DVD collection.
B00005RRG8|4.0|This is the original version of the parent trap. I did like the newer 1998 version slightly more. But, this movie has some good moments. The movie is from Erich Kastner's \\"Das doppelte Lottchen\\" (Lisa and Lotte-The English title.) In the book the girls are about nine years old. In the Hayley Mills version the girls are 13 years old. <br /> There is a lot of typical Disney slapstick. The best part is when the girls finally realize that they are sisters. That was a major \\"Hanky\\" moment. The movie features Hayley Mills as the twins (who the previous year won a special Oscar for \\"Pollyanna\\". \\"Parent Trap\\" made Hayley Mills a pop culture icon. It also featured Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara as the parents. Some of the slapstick is mean spirited, but in all it is fun. Most of the movie consists of the girls trying to get their parents together again. One of the best parts is the camping trip where the girls play a lot of mean tricks on Vicki.
079073804X|5.0|Ellen Burstyn is Chris MacNeil, a successful actress living in a swanky house in Washington, D.C. with her 12 year old daughter Reagan (Linda Blair). They have the perfect mother/daughter relationship, and everything is hunky dory until one evening when Chris throws a party for a group of her friends. At that moment, strange things begin to happen. Reagan makes a disturbing comment at the party. Beds start shaking. Weird noises come from upstairs in the attic. And heads, literally, start turning. In what happens to be a mother's worst nightmare, it is revealed that Reagan is possessed by the demon Pazuzu who can be cast out only through the ritual of an exorcism. I've watched \\"The Exorcist\\" at many times during my life, and it never loses its potency as one of the best movies of all time. What made it a hit was not its fright factor or its then-groundbreaking special effects. It became a critical and commercial success because it vividly illustrated the battle between good and evil unlike any other movie before or since. It pressed spiritual buttons and made some people ponder the validity and depth of their own faith. If you've never been scared before in your life, you probably haven't seen this film (or its parodies on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" or \\"Scary Movie\\"). Director William Friedkin does wonders as he brings to life William Peter Blatty's novel and extracts solid performances from Burstyn, as well as Max Von Sydow and Jason Miller as Father Merrin and Father Karras respectively. \\"The Exorcist\\" was re-released with additional footage and special effects, and while they don't hurt the movie, they do take away some of its effectiveness and dramatic subtlety. The version to get is the 25th Anniversary edition, which has the movie in its pure and original form, as well as an excellent documentary with interviews from the cast and filmmakers. But regardless of which version you get, one thing is sure: you won't be the same person after you watch \\"The Exorcist.\\" It's still a hellraiser even after 30 years.still a hellraiser even after 30 years.
B000002JS6|5.0|After Bon Scott's death, the future for AC/DC looked pretty grim. However, not listening to what the critics said, they decided to recruit a new singer, Brian Johnson, and give it another try. That \\"try\\" became one of the staples of true rock n' roll. \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\" , the title track, \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" and \\"What Do You Do For Money Honey\\" are nothing but classics. If you cannot let loose while listening to this album, you have to be the most uptight person alive. The songs on this album will stay with you for the long haul. Don't forget, ROCK AND ROLL AIN'T NOISE POLLUTION!!!!
B00005JLK1|2.0|Someone needs to remind Hollywood that horror films are supposed to be scary. All horror movies are generally dumb, but when they are dumb and weak the line should be drawn. It was a good concept, getting stranded on a rickety, rusty cruise ship full of ghosts, but they blew it. <br />This movie is weak like Jeepers Creepers, and Phantoms. By that I mean for about 30 minutes it's scary and you'll get into it, but after that short period you'll want out. It stops being scary and all you have left is just stupid. But since they're digging up their talent from ER's dumpster, has-beens or wannabes what could we expect? Juliana whatever-her-name-is left ER to do movies... I hope she's proud of herself. Not only was her acting bad, but she wasn't even a likeable character. If I was the bad guy, I'd have whacked her first. <br />But then a blind grandmother could pimp slap the main villain in this movie. I have finally found a villain less threatening and menacing than effete bad-guy in Stargate (the movie)!<br />I'm not taking up any more of my time talking about it. Go ahead and click on how this review didn't help you, but don't say you weren't warned. If you have to see it, see it. But be smart like me: Rent this, or better yet be smarter, don't bother with it at all.
B00008OWZC|5.0|htwww is easily the most important piece of music in rock and roll history. It should be issued to every 15 year old so they can understand what music should sound like. its pure, raw and timeless. straight up rock and roll at its best. buy it and share it with everyone you know
B00003CXAR|5.0|Jaws is the most scariest film from Steven Spielberg.instead of extreme violence and gore,Spielberg puts some violence,but atmosphere and scares to the film.A shark attacks a beach and it takes shark hunters to catch the shark.the final ending is the best.But Jaws parts 2,3,and THE REVENGE are the worst of the series.Best music score by John Williams.Rated PG for Violence,Some Language and Phony Blood.
B000083E79|4.0|I realize that confessing a love for Cher is credibility suicide in many circles, but I couldn't resist reviewing her latest greatest hits CD, which has been selling rather well. Whether you like Cher or not, you have to admit that her ability to endure five decades is hardly a result of mere blind luck. As we all know, the media and public can be ruthless to divas who are past their sell-by date, but Cher has been able to outlive them all. You can credit that to tenacity, a strong will, and the ability to market yourself as shrewdly as Madonna. On \\"The Very Best of Cher,\\" we witness the singer formerly known as Ms. LaPierre embrace the good, the bad, and the tacky in pop music. There are the predictable songs from her days with Sonny Bono (\\"I Got You, Babe\\"), her remarkably solid solo work from the 1970s (\\"Half Breed\\" and \\"Gypsies, Tramps, and Thieves\\"), her affair with adult contemporary pop rock schlock (\\"If I Could Turn Back Time,\\" \\"I Found Someone\\"), and glittery neo disco (\\"Believe,\\" her biggest single to date). At 21 tracks, the collection captures all eras of her career impressively, but it does have flaws. It omits \\"We All Sleep Alone,\\" and Rodney Jerkins' remix of \\"Different Kind of Love Song\\" is inferior to the original album version. But \\"The Very Best of Cher\\" gets bonus points from me for including the fantastic discocentric \\"All Or Nothing,\\" an underrated and overlooked flop single that's just as good as \\"Believe.\\" Cher is hardly a critics darling, and many will turn their nose and laugh contemptuously. Who cares? \\"The Very Best of Cher\\" makes for a qualified guilty pleasure from one of the most resilient female entertainers around.
B00005QK39|5.0|Let me start the review by writing that I don't agree with those who criticize this fantastic work by saying that it suffers a lot from Genesis influence. I'm comfortable on doing so because Genesis (with Peter Gabriel) is my other big favorite band. For a first original record from a band back in the early 80's, Script For A Jester's Tear has already that unique sounding Marillion would then continue to produce. <br /> <br />The lyrics and vocals from the charismatic lead singer Fish are probably the main reasons for the very own identity of this album, together with a very gifted guitar player - Steve Rothery, and some wonderful moments on the keyboards by Mark Kelly. <br /> <br />High quality music throughout the entire album, starting with the title track - a song with a very special place on the heart of every Marillion aficionado. \\"He Knows You Know\\" has strong lyrics, \\"The Web\\" has great changes of tempo, \\"Garden Party\\" is one of my favorite Marillion songs (the video is definitely my favorite), \\"Chelsea Monday\\" combines in perfection Fish touching lyrics together with Steve's guitar. As for \\"Forgotten Sons\\", try to listen it with headphones (this recommendation applies to the entire album, very well produced): Fish's duet with the newsreader works perfectly, and the final section with the children's chorus is tremendous. <br /> <br />The 2CD edition is highly recommended in this case: the EPIC \\"Grendel\\" or the lovely \\"Three Boats Down From The Candy\\" will tell you why... <br /> <br />Finally, one last word for the cover work by Mark Wilkinson. It has a significant part on what made of this album such a progressive rock reference of the 80s.
B00005JLK1|2.0|If you really want to enjoy this movie, go into it knowing that it stinks. Expect the worst and you'll have a good time. Believe all these teenaged suckers giving it 5 stars and talking about how great it is, and you'll be disappointed. This movie isn't even close to 5 stars. I gave it 2- one extra star for giving my girlfriend and I something to make fun of for 90 minutes. <br />Someone needs to remind Hollywood that horror films are supposed to be scary. All horror movies are generally dumb, but when they are dumb and weak the line should be drawn. It was a good concept, getting stranded on a rickety, rusty cruise ship full of ghosts, but they blew it. <br />This movie is weak like Jeepers Creepers, and Phantoms. Visually, they try to make it look and feel like \\"The Shining\\", but it doesn't come close to that scary or cool. For about 30 minutes it's tense and you'll get into it, but after that short period you'll want out. It stops being scary and all you have left is just stupid. But since they're digging up their talent from ER's dumpster, has-beens or wannabes what could we expect? Juliana whatever-her-name-is left ER to do movies... I hope she's proud of herself.

B00006JJ1O|5.0|This is one of the few albums that all the songs are great.  Usually when an album is released, only a couple of songs are great and the rest [are bad].  However, not this album.  Everysong is catchy and if you have a chance to get the Russian versions of the songs, there are even better.  Hope that they release another album.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|&quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; is not my favorite animated movie of all time, but it has the perfect mix of comedy and drama, that kind of makes you forget it's meant for young kids. I put off buying this dvd version for months, because I thought that because I already owned it on vhs, I wouldn't be upset if I missed it, but I'm glad I got it. This two disc collection features THREE versions of the film! And tells you all about the making of the picture. It also features music videos, and short bits of information about other disney classic's, so you can hear about where the idea's for the films came from. One of these films is &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;. It is the perfect film to add to your collection, and one of the few disney films I will by on dvd. Fun for all ages. Get it before it goes away, cause you know disney, they take movies away for years and years. I already missed my chance to buy a new copy of &quot;Snow White&quot;.
B00008LDPU|5.0|The Animatrix is a collection of 9 animated short stories based on The Matrix movie trilogy. It showcases a broad range of styles including traditional, Japanese Anime, and computer created images. If you are a fan of the live action movie and have ever wondered how the whole Matrix scenerio came to be, this is definitely a must buy. Almost any question one could have about The Matrix is answered here...from the revolt of the machines to the downfall of humanity. Also included in the DVD are extras like commentaries, directors' credits, and an interesting documentary about the tradition of Anime (an excellent introduction for those unacquainted with the phenomena). My only gripe with The Animatrix (and the new Matrix Reloaded movie for that matter) are the occasionally perverted scenes...let's just say if I was a woman I would probably be embarrassed by them. That aside though, The Animatrix is a superb work of modern art and an excellent guide to the world of The Matrix as the writers intended it. Even Anime fans who aren't turned on by the movies may want to at least check this out.
B00006JLX4|5.0|I took a risk one fateful day and decided to get the original release of this album, because I had read so many great things about it in SPIN.   I admit, on the initial listen, that I wasn't really into it.  Songs like \\"No Life Singed Her\\" were annoying as hell, and others were just okay  (like \\"Here\\" and \\"In the mouth a desert\\").  But after a few more listens..... whoo boy.  \\"No Life Singed Her\\" kicked..., and the aforementioned songs that I thought were \\"okay\\" changed my life.  Make no mistake:  this album is awesome.  So awesome, in fact, that a few months later when this remastered version came out, I didn't get all bent out of shape about it (and believe me, I usually do when stuff gets rereleased; can you say X-Men 1.5 DVD???  I lost the damn movie ticket to X2 that was inside.. ugh.. but anyways).  This remastered version is like a dream come true; the bonus tracks are.... wow.  That's all I can say.  I love the original album in its entirety, and of the bonus material I would have to say that \\"Secret Knowledge of Backroads\\", \\"Frontwards\\" (from an EP that came after S&E), and \\"Angel Carver Blues/ Mellow Jazz Docent\\" (a live version of a song from \\"Westing (by Musket and Sextant)\\" that improves greatly on the original).     If you like music at all, buy this now.  You won't regret it.
B00008PC2O|1.0|Before you buy realize most of the reviews here have been about the Ultimate version and NOT the Extreme version.  Another quick note, this dvd has 1, thats right 1 version of the movie.  While the Ultimate has 3 versions (yes thats right the ultimate has more versions then this one). <br /> <br />All extras (except 2 things) are DVD-Rom O N L Y!  Not only this your stuck with one version, and its SHORTER then the ultimate.  The ultimate also has a 3rd version that can be unlocked this one does not have it.   <br /> <br />The only good things are, the medal case art(but don't plan on puting the disc case back in the medal case it will destroy your dvd case), the disc art, and menu design.  <br /> <br />Everything else is worthless inless you have that dvd rom, and there is no 6 hours extra like the ultimate which is great to look thru. <br /> <br />A must miss at all costs...
B000002H6C|5.0|After Cliff Burton's death, many worried that there would be no more Metallica, and even if there were, it would not be quite as good. Well, when they hired Flotsam Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted and went to work on what would become a true masterpiece of metal, all worries were put to rest. This is by far the last of the adventurous and ingenious albums from the \\"four horsemen\\" (if you don't count the recently released ST. ANGER, which returns to the all-intense style of KILL EM ALL). While it may have been the first step towards commercialization, with the video of \\"One\\" and all, it is still far from the ...mainstream metal like Def Lepard and Poison. The album starts off with \\"Blackened,\\" a story of a desolate planet and opst apocalyptic subjects. \\"Blackened\\" contains one of the 5 essential Metallica solos, and is a landmark in bass heavy metal. Next is the ever changing onslaught of song structure and riffs called \\"and Justice For All.\\" Next is \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" which is somewhat about and inspired by Jello Biaffra. Obviously, the album's masterpiece is \\"One.\\" A disturbing and emotional narration of a dismembered soldier's war experience and outlooks from his bed, \\"One\\" not only strikes but ambushes a nerve that \\"Disposable Heroes\\" only touched. The song slowly builds from a pretty, simply chorded ballad into a hellish head banger without the lister even noticing, so engulfed with this emotion. The song contains 3 (yeah, 3) of Metallica's essential solos. Dyer's Eve is an amusingly angry story of over nurished children and the like. Behing MASTER OF PUPPETS, ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL! is one of the greatest metal albums ever created and deserves way more sales than that overblown ...called METALLICA (the \\"Black Album.\\")
0451196716|5.0|Good read.  Really gets you thinking about life and death and all in between.  HIghly recommended.
0385504209|5.0|This is the best book I have read in MANY years, and I read lots of books.  There is something to learn on every page that will boggle your mind and keep you wanting more.  I find it fascinating that one man could store so much knowledge in his head!  NO ONE will come away from this book lacking anything, only wanting more!
B00009EIP4|5.0|Wow, now you talk about a concert.... I love it!! I just recently bought \\"In Orange\\" as well, but there's something about this concert that has you hooked and constantly wanting to re-watch it. It's been months since I first heard about the \\"possible\\" release of a recent Cure concert that was filmed in Berlin. It's so hard not think that at that time it was only a thought, or an idea. I bought it the day after it came out last week, and let me tell you it is totally worth the money. One surprise is that it's a 2 disc concert, with hours of enjoyment (roughly 4 hours), but if you're a big fan like me then you'll absolutley love sitting and staring while you're passing the evening away. <BR>     It opens with of course the \\"Pornography\\" set, a massive crowd of German fans wait for the opening song then almost out of nowhere Robert comes out and EVERYONE goes insane. They play the hell out of these songs, breathing new life into these early 80's classics. It's very intresting to see how well Jason can master the hard drum parts Boris used to play with such ease. Also on the 1st disc is the \\"Disintegration\\" set, and of course they go in order on the albums. Plainsong always gave me chills and it still does in concert. These songs have obviously stood the test of time. <BR>    I'd have to say my favorite part would be \\"Bloodflowers\\", on disc 2. Especially how they played \\"The Loudest Sound\\", it's just so intense and emotional. My favorite part of that song is of course the guitar solo Robert plays. His facial expressions in that particular song are so strong and sincere and it made me want to cry. I always wondered what that song would sound like live. The entire conert is like nothing else.. Just to see how the band has evolved over these last 25 years is amazing. It seems as if every passing year they get more intense and become much deeper. And I believe that is very noticable in this concert. This is a must have for any Cure fan, this shouldn't be passed up. I know that I'm happy I own it. For everyone out there, I think it's safe to say that there WILL be another Cure album coming up here real soon... I say this because I watched the interview section and Robert mentioned what their new projects will be like. I was extremly excited to hear this, so there's some good news to look forward to. <BR>  The show ends with an encore of 2 songs off of \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\\"... \\"If only tonight we could sleep\\" and \\"The Kiss\\". I personally thought that this was a real intresting way to end a concert, mainly because their both from different albums but I still feel like they have the same emotion. It's a real neat twist I think.... Following the encore is a pretty long interview with every member from the band. <BR>     Once again, I strongly urge new and old Cure fans alike to purchase this wonderful concert. You honestly won't be disappointed, there's something for everyone to enjoy while watching this. And by the way, I'm not just telling everyone to 'go and buy it because I'm a fan'.. My Dad sat and watched quite a bit of it with me and he commented on how \\"that's a hell of a band\\". And he's barely even heard of them!! To say the least he was stunned by their talent. So dammit, even if you AREN'T a Cure fan, buy it anyway!! Discover this wonderful band!!  It's a great concert and who doesn't love watching hard-working, gifted and talented musicians?!! Who knows, you just might become a fan!!
B0000039PW|5.0|This cd is a great record by the well-known Notorious B.I.G. This cd is self explanatory on it's effects it had on rap. Just listen to it once and you will see how Notorious B.I.G. got famous off of his first cd. Ready To Die!!
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I first heard \\"All the Things She Said\\" on the radio. (i must admit i thought it was 'All the Things YOU said') Before I had any clue who sang it and that they were bisexual. (yes bisexual NOT LESBIAN) It was a very adrenaline-rushed song with a lot of meaning to it, even if they didn't create the songs but who does these days? Another song I like is \\"Show Me Love\\". But I will confess that \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" is annoyingly catchy. I recommend this CD because it is perfect to listen in the car because you get pumped up, whether your straight, bisexual or homosexual.
B000068IEU|1.0|My husband and I rented this last night (thank God we had a Blockbuster freebie pass)  and we were actually rolling our eyes and chuckling at the poor acting, poor film quality, etc. We both grew up in the 70's and can remember the trailers for this movie and how forbidden it was.<br />Anyways, this movie is so unbelievably awful that we honestly don't know where to begin to help others with our review. None of the characters are convincing, and it is so boring that we cannot believe anyone was even upset by anything about it unless they paid to see it. It is that ridiculous. There are at least four times these young girls could have gotten away but don't even try. The one time the one girl does run away you almost could care less because when three chase after her how do any of them NOT get lost in the woods!? - none of them are from the area. The one girl who is left with a whining dope addict (who by the way is just beginning withdrawal symptoms) doesn't even try to run across the street to her own house!!! She even tells him \\"I live right across the street!\\" <br />Ugh, the bad \\"guys\\" are stupid, and the parents just aren't very concerned that their 17-year-old supposedly left a concert at 2 a.m. and still hasn't arrived home by the following afternoon! The police officers are buffoons. And that famous \\"pay-back\\" seen with the mother in the woods with one of the escapees is just so bad, I don't even know how to review it.<br />What's wrong with this picture? Well, just about everything. Listen, all this hype is of course going to make you want to watch it, we did too, but it is just one of those \\"mental\\" 1970's movies that is only popular because it was Wes Craven's first film.
0060930349|5.0|This is a superb historical narrative, authored by a gifted writer and an immensely talented, conservative historian who has an abiding faith in and respect for America: &quot;It is,&quot; concludes Johnson, &quot;still the first, best hope for the human race.&quot; Johnson weaves outstanding scholarship, keen historical insight and analysis, and, yes, personal wisdom, into an historical text that reads like a novel, yet is bursting with more facts than an almanac (his source notes alone run to over 90 pages). Caution: Johnson's masterfully articulated but politically incorrect views (the engine within his story) will provoke, anger -- or possibly persuade -- readers subscribing to more liberal interpretations of American history.
B000084T18|1.0|50 Cent maybe perhaps the worse rapper to ever walk the planet. Seriously, if this guy has a cd and is popular among Americas most brain dead, then I now declare myself as the greatest rapper ever! Hell I can make a cd and say, \\"Goo shortie, ittz yur birf day\\" HEEEEELP!!!!!! So lets break it down like this. 50 Cents of garbage can not rap what so ever. His lyrics are vauge and bascially sounding like all other class D rappers. This whole \\"I so hard, I've been shot 86 times\\" doesn't work. His beats seem to be the type that a 12 year threw down on his Kalisawki keyboard. Yo \\"Fitttty\\" itzz yur birf day, now go away!
B000056MOD|3.0|I'm a fan of the Highlander series, and have also seen the original Highlander (the one with Connor and his mentor, played by Sean Connery). I did find this film enjoyable. However, the plot-line was difficult to understand, and much was left up to the viewer to piece together by himself.<br />The real problem with this movie is that it should never have released in the theatres, and should have been expanded into several prequel episodes for the Highlander Series. There are many interesting plot-lines here which are completely unexplored or dropped.<br />For example, the evil immortal, Jacob Kell, was apparently a mortal fanatic, who Connor killed after Kell had Connor's mother burned at the stake for heresy. Then, apparently, because whenever an immortal kills a mortal, he or she becomes an immortal, Jacob became and immortal. Apparently, Kell was after vengeance against Connor, because Connor killed Jacob's fanatic father (who was also responsible for having Connor's mother burned at the stake). Oh yea, there is an inconsistency there. How exactly did Jacob become and immortal, but not his father? Or was Jacob and immortal all along, but didn't know it? Just one of the many unexplained inconsistencies in this movie that you'd be not try to think about if you want to enjoy the film. All of this is up to the viewer to figure out. This is the main plot-line that drives the movie: Kell's desire to cruely avenge his mentor's death, by tormenting Connor, and then Duncan. He does this by killing everyone that they love (as Jacob Kell apparently cared for his menter, this was eye for an eye).<br />There are also some other plot-lines that could have been promising, but weren't developed fully. For example, Duncan's relationshiop with Kate Delaney. Kate is Duncan's long-lost lover, whom he killed to make immortal on their wedding eve. Shocked by his actions, and startled by her own immortality, Kate ran from Duncan, hating him for giving her no choice in the matter, though still loving him. She's now seeking revenge on him. ***Note: There are two versions of this movie. One of them has a happy ending for Kate and Duncan, the other does not...watch the longer one with a happy ending*** That's one sub-plot that was worthy of a much lengthier and more coherent treatment.<br />There's also the interesting sub-plot of the Methos (the oldest immortal, and unbeknownst to Duncan, probably one of the most deadly, and at one point one of the cruelest) and the Watchers was mentioned, but hardly given enough worthy treatment.<br />Now, if you want to enjoy this movie, you'll have to put logic aside a little bit. Each sequel to the first film completely negates the other sequels. Each sequel also partially negates the original, though leaving enough of it intact to be called a \\"sequel\\" (except for #2). This one is no different. It's probably the best sequel, and you'll have to look at it as a direct sequel to the first movie. In no way can it be logically viewed as a sequel to the 3rd installation of the franchise.<br />My general impression of this film is that people who aren't fans of the Highlander franchise already (both the original and the series) will not like it. They will be way too confused to extract any pleasure from watching this film. Fans of the original and the sequel will also be confused, but may be able to piece things together and enjoy it. This is a movie that could have been much better, but is still good enough to be enjoyable to fans.
B00005JLRT|3.0|I'm a huge fan of the Trek saga and have enjoyed all the movies and TV series, some more than others of course. I would be the last person to say anything bad about anything Trek, but I have to say I was very disappointed in \\"Nemesis\\". <BR> Judging it as a movie in general, I would have to say that it is pretty good with some great action scenes and interesting characters. Judging it as a Trek movie, I would have to say that it is not so great. <BR> The Trek universe is so large and yet the only story they could come up with is quite obviously a rip-off of previous Trek movies most notably \\"Wrath of Khan\\". There are so many other great stories that could have been done so much better. <BR> One of the things I love most about TNG is the relationships between the crew and this movie seemed to leave that out for the most part. It focuses mainly on Picard and Data, what about the rest of the crew? They are there, but not much. Since this was touted as the \\"final generation movie\\" you'd think they would have done something that involved the entire crew. <BR> To sum it up, good movie, not so good Trek! Where's Q when you need him?
B000002UJQ|1.0|Really not a bad album, considering the sheer amount of garbage stinking up popular music (and this is without a doubt popular music). Just simply put, the most overrated album of the 90s. Nothing here is incredibly innovative, production-wise or songwriting-wise (the band wrote much better, hookier songs on their two previous albums), and at times the preachy and pretentious &quot;social commentary&quot; of tracks like... well all of them, can be extremely cloying. Especially when delivered by the thin, drawn-out falsetto of Thom Yorke. I disagree with some of the other negative reviews that say the band lacks talent, that just isn't true, their songs are just, for the most part, bland, drab, and almost totally humourless. Also, the much-ballyhooed production sounds too sharp and tinny to these ears. In terms of &quot;feeling&quot; this album, and not listening to it (as some reviewers here suggest that I do), I must say I always feel like hitting &quot;Stop&quot; about 30 seconds into &quot;Exit Music&quot;. Aptly titled I guess. For much better music I recommend going to the band's influences, My Bloody Valentine, Pixies, and Neu! I also highly suggest the Flaming Lips, highly innovative, &quot;futuristic&quot; pop music with a sense of joy and un-contrived emotion that Radiohead simply lacks.

B000084T18|5.0|OK.. First off, let me say that anyone who says that 50 is a bad rapper needs to stop listening to rap. The man has skills, period. He is one of a dying breed who can actually make bars that rhyme and make sense at the same time.  His rhymes are that of borderline genius in the rap game. Sure all the old rappers like Rakim and Nas were tremendous rappes, but 50's flow, his vibe and voice blows both of them out of the water. Many people disagree with what 50 says in his songs, and they should also stop listening to rap. There are no limits to what rappers can and want to say, and all 50 is speaking about is the life that he lived in the streets. All of 50's haters couldnt spend a day in 50's shoes so they should stop talking. The CD is one where every single song is awesome, a rarity in this day and age. Eminem has found a true star that can almost rival him in lyricist skills. 50 and Eminem team up for a tremendous track called \\"Patiently Waiting\\" in which Eminem rips it up and then 50 takes it and spits genius in the 3rd verse. Also 50 teams up with fellow G-Unit member Tony Yayo on \\"Like My Style\\" in which 50 raps really well to a tap your feet beat. This CD is a masterpiece in a world where rap is losing its value.
B00005JM09|5.0|It's been 12 years since T2, which means this is one of the most anticipated films in movie history! Arnold looks great, the cast looks promising, the T-X is going be iconic, and from what I hear the story is out of this world. A lot of people don't expect this film to live up to 91's Judgement Day, mainly due to the fact that James Cameron is not directing, but my advice for them is...... How do you know if a hot dog is good or not before you taste it? No one has any idea what T3 has in store, it could possibly be the biggest film of the year, so just wait a while before you pass judgement.  <br />T3 is a guaranteed SMASH! BRING IT ON!
B000060MY6|4.0|Betty, a young, aspiring actress, comes to Hollywood where she plans to stay at her aunt's apartment. When Betty arrives there she discovers a beautiful woman in the shower; Betty immediately assumes that this woman is a house guest of her aunt's. It seems that this enigmatic woman suffered a head injury in a terrible car collision and cannot recall her identity. Betty eagerly assists the woman in her efforts to rediscover herself. The film also contains a subplot concerning a film director who is strong-armed into hiring a certain actress for a role for which he is currently casting.<br />The real mystery is how a film as continuously mesmerizing and spooky as this one is, with marvelous set pieces (especially Betty's audition, the aforementioned shower sequence, etc.), extraordinarily fluid direction and camera work, and containing a sensitive and canny performance by Naomi Watts as the aspiring actress could so completely be derailed in its last 20 minutes or so. David Lynch, for reasons I cannot fathom, decides to play fast and loose with the plot and his characters' identities. The result is unbelievable chaos and confusion. Film critic Roger Ebert attempts to explain away the film's coda as something that could only have occurred in a dream. I call it the worst cop out since Pam dreamed Bobby Ewing's death for an entire season in tv's \\"Dallas.\\" And yet, despite my disappointment, \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is in many ways, and for the reasons I stated, a great piece of film making that, I am sure, will long linger in my memory.
B000002UAF|5.0|I LOVE this Album. I LOVE the movie. I LIKE the CD.<br />It just AMAZES me that some idiots are still in the Stones [ Zep or whoever] are BETTER mode that my friends and I did back in high school. I was Beatles THEY were Stones. NOW I think the Stones are the Greatest living Rock and Roll band but the Beatles ARE the best there ever was. This is ART people. You just CAN NOT say definitively that something IS better without sounding totally ignorant. You CAN say  YOU  like it better. ALSO POP my BH [rear] Maybe THIS album is a bit poppy but what about Hey Bulldog Old Brown Shoe and Helter Skelter ?<br />SO WHERE are those cool Beatles instrumental jazz tracks that were on the album ? I always wondered who did em. Sounds kinda Brubeck. I miss them on the CD.<br />Why do we say something is out of whack? What's a whack?
0688163173|4.0|As you can tell from the various customer reviews found on this site, Shutter Island drudges up some mixed reactions. People either seem to love it or hate it. Personally, I'm in the former category.<br />Shutter Island is definitely a departure for Lehane, but I'm glad he did it. This book is a twisty/creepy plunge into a high-security psychiatric ward, and the atmosphere is so thick you can reach out and pinch it. The main character, Teddy Daniels, is engaging and well-developed, as is his partner, Chuck Aule, and my attachment to these characters made the suspense really grab hold. And most importantly, this is one of the best endings I've come across in a long time and not one soon forgotten. Very clever and wonderfully portrayed.<br />Really, my only gripe with the novel is that there were a few spots that dragged. Not many, but enough for me to take notice.<br />All in all, another gem from Lehane and one that shouldn't be passed up. A quick warning: it isn't a very optimistic book, so if that bothers you, you might want to skip this one. But if you enjoy twisty plots, a dark, foreboding atmosphere and an ending that'll knock you on your rear, then give it a shot.
B00006RU5B|5.0|In a year where Godsmack, Linkin Park and Disturbed all put out boring repetitious albums Audioslave stands above on sheer musicionship alone.  Not a big RATM fan or Cornell fan for that matter, but this album is excellent.  In a music scene polluted with song after song of the same three cords, Audioslave distinguishes themselves with variety and true musical ability.<br />Even in light of a new Metallica (subpar at best) Audioslave just nudges out Blessed Hellride (Black Label Society) for Hard rock album of the year.

B000067JBN|3.0|If you've seen the 1960's version of the \\"Time Machine\\" or even braved Welles's book (or caught \\"Time After Time in 1979) there's really not a lot that will surprise you.  That's a shame, because there's actually a lot here to enjoy, but spoiled by a script that seems to content to stick to the basics of a story that most science-fiction fans already know (at least subconsciously) and plump the rest with action.  <br />In the new version, the \\"Time Traveler\\" is a \\"Turn of the Century\\" New York inventor named Hartdegen (Guy Pierce), an earnest scientist who tragically loses his fiancée during a robbery in Central Park.  Unlike intellectuals find solace in learning from the past and re-shaping the future, Hartdegen (who trades letters with some way-out Swiss patent clerk named Einstein) is determined to reshape the past and keep his future nice and neat.  Throwing himself into his work, Hartdegen conceives a time machine.  (That's right - though a product of Victorian times, Hartdegen is a very contemporary hero, for him it's personal.) Revisiting the scene of tragedy, Hartdegen saves the day - only to see his fiancée die anyway.  No matter how often Hartdegen changes the history, fates snaps back.  Frustrated, Hartdegen jumps ahead in time, hoping that a future civilization (which of course must be an advanced and civilized society) will discover how you can change history.  Mankind of the future, Hartdegen unfortunately learns, is less concerned with changing the future or the past as it is with turning the moon into a huge condo. For serious questions, the future turns to a chatty holographic computer named Vox (Orlando Jones).  Vox can't really solve Hartdegen's problems, but that's not really the point.  We're smart enough to know that Hartdegen will never find an answer - a race against time is always a losing proposition.<br />Jumping farther into the future when a global cataclysm nearly wipes out humanity, Hartdegen finds himself in the deceptive tranquility described in the original book - one in which the human race is split in half between gentle Eloi who do and think nothing, and the vicious Morlocks who create and consume everything.  Hartdegen has barely enough time to fall in love and consider abandoning his search when he learns of the Morlocks, and decides that he must save the Eloi.  The story introduces one new novelty - a thinking \\"uber\\" Morlock played by Jeremy Irons (an inspired bit of casting - he has psychic powers and can throw you around by the throat, but it's his verbal delivery that's deadliest), and even finds a way to keep Vox around in an age in which his creators aren't even a memory.  The story is actually full of cool details, but spends no time on them before tossing Hartdegen into a fight or onto his machine or gets some other CGI action going.  The story takes a novel approach to explaining what wiped out \\"civilization\\" (it was supposed to be war - class war in Welles's book, and nuclear war in the first movie; here it's a horrible miscalculation we can probably blame on some mega-corporation), but wastes little time between setting humanity up for a fall and dropping the bomb.  Vox is annoying, and even verges into being inhuman (he seems a bit too fascinated by the vicious order of the Morlocks and Eloi) but that's the point - he's not supposed to be human, and he's supposed to be more amused than repelled by cruelty because of how much cruelty comprises his card catalog.  Unfortunately, the film humanizes him, as if it knows no middle-ground between naughty and nice.  The film gets some good mileage out of Hartdegen's personal search for a way to change the past, and surprisingly sets up the uber morlock with the climactic job of convincing him that he's stuck with the cards dealt by fate.  Unfortunately, by then, Hartdegen has at least probably put that problem on the back burner, and it hasn't exactly obsessed us either.  The uber Morlock becomes a mechanism for discovering Hartdegen's demon's, not by analyzing his machine, but simply reading his mind.  It's not clear how his mental powers really can deal with Hartdegen's problems - but it's soon clear that the script has the same problem - the confrontation turns into a fight.  In the end, this ed. of \\"The Time Machine\\" uses CGI effects to trail off where its smarter ideas should have been, leaving you little more than a slightly more inventive version of the original.  If you've never seen (or read) it, you'll probably have the most fun.
0780619951|4.0|Im a fan of strange and deep meaning films, so this is right up my alley!<br />I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 16 years old and I liked it back then, but I have a new and better apreciation for it now that Im older and wiser. At the age of 16 I would describe this movie as strange and scary. At the current age of 24, I would describe the movie as well casted, strange, scary, deeply thought provoking, excellent cinematography and written to the T!! A better and more scary soundtrack definetly could have enhanced this film, but its still great!<br />The deep meaning I got out of the film is this... We are born into a world that is not perfect and sometimes unfair. We can revolt against this unperfect world and self destruct our own lives, or we can play by the rules and strive for peace.<br />The idea of crossing animals with humans to create something more perfect is an interesting idea. We could get something more sinister and brutal then humans, but we could also get something more passionate, faithful and understanding. This movie plays on both of those possibilities very well...<br />If your looking for a very twisted version of a &quot;Lord of the flies&quot; type movie, then check this out!

6303393977|5.0|I know, I know. . .many can take issue with the title above.  Consider Sergio Leone's &quot;spaghetti&quot; Westerns, or Sam Peckinpah's brutal &quot;The Wild Bunch.&quot;  Both directors broke ground, but in my very humble opinion neither had the same impact on the genre that director George Roy Hill commanded when BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID hit the big screen in 1969.<br />This film took a Western and injected it with a healthy dose of pop culture.  The soundtrack bears this out--even to the point of treating us with the pre-MTV music video, &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head.&quot;  Ever see a John Wayne movie of the Sixties that had jazz singers humming the soundtrack?  Didn't think so.<br />Even more compelling is the story, a story about two bank robbers trying to hang onto the Old West in a rapidly changing world.  They're outlaws, but they're the &quot;good guys,&quot; totally likeable and captivating.  The viewer is pulling for them to escape the law, plan their next move, rob another day.  The ending is inevitable, yet tastefully and poignantly done.<br />Much has been made about the chemistry between Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) and Robert Redford (Sundance)--and rightfully so.  The dialogue, banter, timing between these two wonderful actors is flawless, brilliant, overwhelming.  There are classic lines (&quot;Who are those guys?&quot;) and scenes (Butch's &quot;rules&quot; for a knife fight) that will live in cinematic lore forever.  Katharine Ross as Etta Place (&quot;I'm 25, single, a schoolteacher, and that's the pits.&quot;) is a wonderful addition to the cast as Sundance's girlfriend and soulmate to both outlaws.<br />Equally innovative was the film's cinematography--starting in grainy black and white and changing to vivid color as Butch and Sundance ride over breathtaking scenery.  BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID ushered in the contemporary Western, and I'm darned glad it did.<br />--D. Mikels

B000000OPW|4.0|This is the first album that I ever heard from Siouxsie and the Banshees back in 1986.  I had never heard anything like Siouxsie's voice and sinister folklore lyrics before.  I was amazed to find out that they had been a top 40 act in England for years.  Tinderbox was not one of their most experimental or diverse albums but the songs are all very intricate and would keep a banshee fan happy.  In my opinion &quot;Land's End&quot; is the most experimental and best song on here.  &quot;Cities in Dust&quot; remains a favorite with her fans.  Who else but Siouxsie could write a song about Mt. Vesuvius erupting over Pompeii and score a hit?
B00008DDXC|5.0|Movie fans have come to expect a lot of extras on the DVD release of movies and this edition of the Harry Potter series provides them.<br />In addition to an extended version of the movie (the usual extra scenes) you get background interviews with the actors, some DVD fun activities such as exploring the Hogwarts environs and some (Windows based) PC extras that kids will appreciate.<br />The picture and sound quality are good though the DVD menu might be a little hard for younger kids to traverse at first.
B00005JMC6|4.0|Just like ballet is not \\"meant\\" for boys, leadership is not meant for girls. Not an altogether seminal theme. But contrary to what the blurbs going around for this latest offering from NZ had me believe, this is not your average run-down feminist movie. You'll be pleasantly surprised, there is a good reason why this has astounded audiences at top international film awards...a wholesome fare in every sense.<br />To begin with, Lisa Gerrard is easily the top contemporary musician around (Insider, Gladiator) and to say that her soundtrack here is gutwrenching is an understatement. Couple that with some mindblowing imagery of whales and it's easy to figure why NZ has been featuring so prominently in international minds of late (Once Were Warriors, Lord of the Rings etc) with their other-worldly yet identifiable themes.<br />Speaking of which, despite the parochial nature of the setting the overall undercurrent of the movie represents a wide universal appeal -- the message of endurance, filial bonds, breaking of tradition molds, reverence, learning. One of the most enthralling aspects of the education theme comes off in a contrast between the movie's two \\"teachers\\" -- Pai's Koro (played wonderfully by Rawiri Paratene) and Paikea (played by Keisha Castle-Hughes, in a surprisingly mature performance coming from a child actor, a la Haley Joel in the Sixth Sense).<br />I reluctantly pull off one star for the occasionally overdone and mildly ambiguous spiritual takes, whales not being the most emotive of mammals. But this is required viewing if you care for moving, meaningful cinema.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I never thought I would see such a magnificent transfer of Tolkien's work from the written word to the big (and little) screen. After years of disappointing animated efforts this trilogy exceeded my expectations.<br />The Two Towers continues the story established in The Fellowship of the Ring. Readers of Tolkien's works had little problem following the story line (or in lamenting the number of excluded scenes in the movie) but first-time viewers missed much of the underlying tapestry of Middle Earth.<br />The same holds for this edition. The action is spectacular, and the story remains *reasonably* faithful to the written version, but what is missing from the screen version is the sense of depth readers got from the songs and notes in the books.  The movie *is* different from the books, so Tolkien purists may want to keep a list of their grievances. ;)  My biggest objection is that the movie portays present society attitudes about warfare--a reluctance to engage in combat.  This was simply not the case in the books.  Any reluctance to fight was due to Sauruman's influence (via Wormtongue), that is to say, PROPAGANDA...an important point in the book that does not come across in the movie.  There are other differences, but this was to be a 2.5 hour movie, not an entire mini-series unto itself!<br />Despite the drawbacks the movie is excellent. It is as visually appealing as the first movie and the computer generated scenes mesh well with the live action footage, though not quite to the same level as _Attack of the Clones_.<br />The DVD will deliver the usual extra features: interviews with the actors, previews of the third movie, a sneak peek at the video game and additional audio/visual choices.<br />This will be an essential addition for fans of Tolkien, though anyone who will be purchasing the eventual \\"special collector's platinum anniversary utlimate edition trilogy boxed set\\" releases you know are coming in the years ahead might want to consider buying this used or simply renting it, then purchasing the special edition(s) that will be released in 2004 and beyond.

B000002H2H|5.0|This was the album that truly set Metallica on the path from a traditional and occasionally simplistic thrash band, into metal's true pioneers. While Ride The Lightning retains the aggression and speed of their debut Kill 'Em All, indeed it may even be faster than their earlier material in some places, it has a maturity and complexity that was all but missing from their debut. The album opens with a nice bit of feather-light nylon-stringed acoustic strummery, before being blown apart by one of the most intense riffs ever written. The song is \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\", and it sounds like the end of the world. Its metal faster than you thought it could be, and Hetfield's vocal performance adds it a menacing backbone of aggression. Its clear that his vocal ability has developed greatly since their debut, and this is a great contributor to the brilliance of the album. Then comes a slower, but no less powerful song with the title track \\"Ride The Lightning\\". The song a great demonstration of Metallica's new understanding that faster does not neccesarrily mean heavier or more intense, as the song has both heaviness and intensity in spades. Then comes \\"For Whom The Bell Tolls\\", a demonstration of Metallica's epic leanings and disregard for convention, which had only before been hinted at on Kill 'Em All's \\"The Four Hoursemen\\". The song is long and complex, but is brilliantly executed, and does not suffer from being boring or pretentious, a sign of true talent. Then comes one of Metallica's defining moments, suicide anthem \\"Fade To Black\\". A story of depression and alienation, combining soft acoustic verses and charging choruses. Its a true piece of art, with Hetfield's tremendous vocal performance bringing the lyrics to life, and Hammett's solos convey an incredibly amount of emotion. Compared to the brilliance of side one, side two begins with a slight let-down. \\"Trapped Under Ice\\" may indeed be a great thrash song, but compared to what has come before, it might as well havebeen lifted off the Kill 'Em All album, displaying little of the bands new found maturity. Then comes \\"Escape\\", one of the least interesting songs ever written by Metallica, and their first foray into slick radio-friendly metal. However, the band thoroughly redeems itself with the stunning \\"Creeping Death\\". The band take their maturity and boundary-breaking methods, and apply them to a traditional thrash song, and what emerges is a combination of high-speed thrash riffery, complex song structure and one of the most inspired fill sections in music history. This is the style that would dominate Metallica's true masterpiece Master Of Puppets, but this song stands up to almost anything on that album. Then comes the true shock of the album. If you thought Metallica would be comfortable with just meddling with song structures and dynamics and leave it at that, you'll be amazed with the albums closer, an eight-minute instrumental. It is brilliantly done, although not quite as well executed as a similar piece on the Master Of Puppets album. Interest does flag at some points, but it is an extremely brave thing for a metal band to do, and works extremely well, thanks both to the bands musical abilities and songwriting skills. So there you have it, the first of two masterpieces that Metallica would contribute two heavy metal. Certainly the weaker of the two, but still an amazing achievement, and easily worth the price of purchase. An essential piece of metal history.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I thought this film was fantastic. I think that this is by far the best of all the comic book movies, and is much better than X-Men 1. The special effects, characters, and storyline were well put together and the soundtrack is also fantastic. <br />I saw this movie at the World Premiere, in Leicester Square, London, so I may be a little biased, yet I would reccomend this to anybody. My mother who I attended the film with, had never seen the first movie, and is very anti-sci-fi, however she loved this film! 10/10
B000002H33|5.0|Who would have thought? Back in 1983, Metallica were the speed metal footsoldiers, pumping out super-speed metal anthems of fast-living and us-versus-them mentality. Three years, and, by way of the magnificent Ride The Lightning, theyve progressed to this. Epic songs, ranging from the wondorous eight-minute Master Of Puppets, to the blink-and-you-missed-it five minutes of Damage Inc. Gone is the occasionally one-dimensional thrash brutality of kill 'em all, replaced by sweeping song structures, classical interludes, and acoustic tenderness. But all you hardcore metal elitists out there, fear not, the songs are predominantly super-fast and heavy, with Hetfield and Hammett churning out more tremendous riffs in this one album than most bands manage in their entire careers. Lars Ulrich's drumming is speed and precision defined, a perfect background for the galloping guitars. Battery lures you in with its quiet acoustic interlude, before being blown apart by some good old fashioned high-speed riffery. Master Of Puppets is a truly epic metal classic, crushing the listener with a parade of tremndous riffs, hooked together with Hetfield's growled vocals of drug addiction. The song also features one of the most stunning classical interludes I have ever been priveliged to hear. The Thing That Should Not Be slows the pace down without losing any of the heaviness, and features a truly monstrous Hammett solo. Then comes Welcome Home (Sanitarium), in my humble opinion the best song Metallica have ever committed to record. A slow, acoustic intro and beautiful solo leads into Hetfield's brilliant sung verses of submission, followed by an electric chorus. Then, as the song progresses, it develops from slow and heartfelt into an aggressive thrash song, and its one of the most inspiring aural experiences ever devised. Then follows Disposable Heroes, a super-fast antidote to Sanitarium's relative slowness with an exceptionally long solo, even by Metallica's standards. Then comes LeperMessiah, the albums only disappointment. On its own, its a great song, but after the first five songs, its a bit of a let-down. However, the tallica boys bring it right back with an eight-minute instrumental Orion. This is where Cliff Burton truly shines, holding the whole thing together and keeping it exciting with his tremendous bass work. Then the band burst into Damage Inc, one of the most hyper-agressive, super-fast thrash songs ever made, and its truly inspired, leaving the album on a high-note of supercharged energy. And there you have it, the best thrash metal album ever made, the best heavy metal album ever made, the best metal album ever made. Full stop.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful album.  I was disappointed with how Make Yourself was too techno, but this time Incubus ditched the synthesizer and allowed themselves to create real music.  They did alot of very imaginative things (is that a sitar I hear?), and all of these things worked beautifully.  I have to recommend this record to anyone and everyone.  If you like hard mosh pit stuff, they've got it: Circles, Have You Ever.  If you like slower lonely-drive-home stuff, they've got it: 11AM, Mexico.  If you like power-ballad sing-along stuff, they've got it: Warning, Wish You Were Here.<br />I just really can't say enough about how good this CD is, I hope that you'll trust me and give it a whirl.
0440236738|3.0|As a fan of Harlan Coben's books, this one was a mixed blessing. It had great plot twists, some of which were telegraphed, some of which came out of the blue. The problem with the book is that it is simply too disturbing and violent--unnecessarily so. It seems that Coben has decided to imitate Andrew Vachss, and has not done a very good job of it. The gruesome descriptions are not necessary, and interfere with his usually excellent writing style.
B000069HP6|3.0|I saw the Black Hole when I was a kid in a format worthy of its effects, 70mm.  The ner video release with widescreen format takes me back to when I was ten and really dug this movie.  For a ten year old this movie is great.<br />For an adult, well, the plot, physics and acting have a few problems.  The plot had no real problems with it other than connecting the dots better.  Had it been tighter I think many of the other problems would have been less of an issue.  Physics is another big problem, there are a number of scenes towards the end where either the black hole's gravity of vacuum of space should have presented bigger problems when the Cygnus was falling apart.  Lastly the acting was a little flat, but that might be due to the problematic script if rewrites were all to common.<br />The special effects, even by todays CGI standards, is good.  For 1979 they were great!  It might have been nice to see Disney revamp some of the effects with CGI, like BBC did with Red Dwarf.  The sets are well dressed and the effects around them are good fun (so long as you ignore some rules of physics).
B00005OM4N|4.0|I gave this CD 4 stars b/c I think it rocks (the full 15 song-version) but there's always room for improvement. For example, the remixes released as singles were a BIG improvement over the album tracks. The best songs: When I Found You, Not A Girl (remix), That's Where You Take Me, Lonely, & I Run Away (she sounds awesome in this song.)<br />I think people underrate her singing. She sounds chirpy sometimes on CD but that's b/c of the songs she sings. She has an amazingly low and soulful voice when she sings slow ballads and she could improve on her sound if she sang more like that.<br />By now, I think she's obviously proved she's left her clones and competitors in the dust. She definitely is the only one with long term staying power and she keeps raising the bar with each release...I can't wait for the fourth. Rock On, Brit.
B00008J4P5|1.0|This cd is just a bunch of talentless noise disguised as brilliance.  After a few listens, and after a few comparisons to other rock records, you will probably see that Elephant is nothing more than another major label scam.<br />If you want something good, check out Interpol's \\"Turn On The Bright Lights\\".
B0000027RL|5.0|Is Ten old-fashioned? A friend once said &quot;Ten sounds old-fashioned.&quot; Indeed Pearl Jam is said to be affected by '70s hard rock such as the Doors, Cream and so on,but it doesn't mean that Pearl Jam's music is old-fashioned. I think it has a kind of twist,distortion and heaviness which we don't usually hear in hard rock from the '70s. I repeat, Ten is not old-fashioned--it has an originality that makes us feel good.
B00008WG3U|3.0|I'll admit that I never really gave NOFX a fair chance.  They were too popular for my elitist punk tastes.  But I gave this record a spin.<br />I enjoyed tracks 1,2 and 10.  They're speedy, enjoyable songs with addictive choruses.  The rest, however, was nothing particularily memorable.  <BR>In the end I give this a 6, because 3 of the songs here are definitely enjoyable.
B00005UW9T|4.0|I thought that the animation was okay. The actors had the perfect voices for the characters, and the music was nice and memerable. I also agree with Amazon that the story was enough without the villian-I just skipped over those parts. All in all, the whole movie was really good. On par with Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. The one thing that really irked me was the romantizing of the Romanoff reign (I know, I know, it's a movie) The movie made it seem like the Romanoff's were just great rulers and that the peasents had no right to be angry; instead of how the Romanoff's totally screwed over the peasents and were extremely brutish. Other than that...
B00005JLR2|3.0|Summary:<br />Jim Hawkins's (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) dad walked out on him and his mother and his mother, who is trying to run an inn, isn't able to be the father figure that Jim wants and needs.  As a result, Jim is a bit too free-spirited and has a tendency to do illegal things, like jet-board through mining plants (don't know what they actually call the device he was riding).  Jim doesn't see a future for himself helping his mother, Sarah (Laurie Metcalf), at the inn; he's bored, wants an adventure, but also wants a dad.<br />Well, he gets both when someone crash lands outside their inn and gives Jim a weird ball before he dies.  Just after he gives Jim the map, a band of pirates attacks and destroys the inn and Jim has to escape with his mother and a bumbling professor, Doctor Doppler (David Hyde Pierce).  When they get to the doctor's house, Jim just happens to open the map and they realize it is the map to the famed Treasure Planet.  Doctor Doppler agrees to fund the expedition if Sarah is willing to let Jim go.  She agrees and they are off.<br />They hire a ship whose crew, other than the captain and first officer, Captain Amelia (Emma Thompson) and Mr. Arrow (Roscoe Lee Browne), just happen to be the same band of pirates that were after the map in the first place.  Their leader, John Silver (Brian Murray (I)) becomes the father figure Jim has wanted for so long only to betray that trust and then eventually renew it when he gives up the treasure to save Jim's life.<br />In the end, the treasure is found but lost and Jim finds out who he is and is finally able to make the 'right' decisions.<br />My Comments:<br />I used to think that Disney just made films telling good stories.  Now that I'm watching them as an adult I'm beginning to realize that Disney is pretty good at incorporating themes into their movies.  I think this is actually kind of a complicated theme, but it's definitely there and I think it's a timely theme, though perhaps for youth that wouldn't be caught dead watching a Disney film.  The theme I understood from this movie is addressing the situation of a growing number of disenchanted youth.  They are the youth whose parents, though considerate, are busy with their own lives but still want the best for their children.  The kids, on the other hand, are bright but bored.  So, they look for adventure in things that are illegal because it is exciting.  I'm not exactly sure how Disney seems to be resolving this issue, but they are definitely trying to address it.<br />Anyway, as for the movie itself, the story follows that of Treasure Island but is cast uniquely in the future where they still use pirate-like space ships that don't require the use of atmospheres or oxygen (this part of the movie didn't make any sense) but instead use boosters and solar sails.  The story works fairly well, for the most part (the ending was a little hokey), even though Jim's character arc isn't very clear.<br />There are three animated characters that are notable for their contributions: Doctor Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) whose character is rather funny at times; B.E.N. (Martin Short), who is even funnier in his very short and limited role; and Morph (Dane A. Davis) who is perhaps the funniest character due to his imitations.  All three add a very necessary element of humor to the movie and do it very well.<br />Overall, as noted above, the movie seems to be very much themed around coming of age and trying to find oneself.  The story is something of a classic, with a strange but workable twist.  Perhaps if you could get your wayward youth to watch the film he/she might enjoy it and be able to relate.  But getting them to watch is likely going to be the hard part.  I recommend it, but I don't know that it would appeal to everyone.  It is definitely geared toward a slightly older (early teens) audience (some of the dialogue is a bit complicated for younger kids to understand), but should be entertaining for anyone that has ever readTreasure Island or enjoys science fiction.
B000000OAN|5.0|A masterful piece of work that showcases the talents of all band members, in a broad range of musical styles that broadened the rock genre...
B00006LLOB|5.0|This collection has often been criticized, but it really is a fine collaboration of some great musicians, and Howlin Wolf of course, that grows on you.... Who's been talking really is the best track in my opinion and just sets a nice grove...
0783227019|4.0|Summary:<BR>Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is an ex-drug lord that has recently been released early from a 30-year sentence because his lawyer, Kleinfeld (Sean Penn), found a loophole.  Now that he's out and aging he has decided to retire from the criminal world and become a legitimate business man, pursuing a dream to escape New York and move to the Caribbean where a role in a business venture awaits him.  However, Carlito's past hasn't given him permission to let it go.  He has to many friends, pseudo-friends, and enemies to get away that easily.  <br />But ironically it is his friendship with the man that freed him, Kleinfeld, that ends up causing him the most trouble; Kleinfeld is a thieving cocaine addict who has betrayed too many people.  Not knowing the best way to get himself out of the trouble, he enlists Carlito to help him, who does against the advice of his renewed love interest, Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), who was going to escape to the Caribbean with him.  Kleinfeld screws things up and now he and Carlito are wanted men.  Kleinfeld doesn't really have a chance, but Carlito does.  But there are a lot of people that don't want him to leave town and are willing to risk quite a bit to prevent it. <br />My Comments:<BR>Somewhat following the Godfather tradition, Al Pacino delivers a great performance in this film.  But the even better performer is Sean Penn.  Penn is, as always, a very convincing dopehead.  He is a great character actor, especially when the character is a druggy.  Also good is John Leguizamo whose role as Benny Blanco turns out to be of primary importance.  <br />The story is convincing, well-written, and makes logical sense.  You find yourself continually rooting for Carlito to truly pursue his dream and get out of Dodge, but it is repeatedly delayed and as the movie continues you begin to realize that Carlito's chances of leaving for the Caribbean are dwindling.  Apparently connections to the underworld of crime are difficult to kill, whichis good reason not to get involved in the first place, but the movie begins with Carlito having already been involved so now he just has to try to escape.  <br />Overall, the movie is entertaining.  There is a bit of nudity, limited to women's breasts and semi-discrete sex scenes, so if that is a concern you may want to skip it.  Perhaps the producer and casting agent did so intentionally to build off his Godfather fame, but Al Pacino is great in this role, not surprisingly, and if you are a fan of Al Pacino or gangster movies this is definitely one to see.
B000069I1C|5.0|I had never heard of this movie until I saw it on the new release shelf. And since it starred Eddie Murphy with Robert DeNiro of all people, I just had to see what it was about. It's a good buddy cop comedy that was a lot funnier than I thought it would be. Eddie and Roberts characters are perfect foils for each other. I think this is one of Eddie Murphy's best movies, along with 'Coming to America', 'A Vampire in Brooklyn', the 'Beverly Hills Cop' series and 'The Golden Child'. Do yourself a favor and give it a try.
B00008PC2O|5.0|I picked this up at a department store which i won't name, the first week it came out for $15.00, i couldn't pass on the price, the case is real medal, and if that's not appealing enough, the extras on the dvd are awsome, because the film is a special edition it is not the orginal T2 that was shown in the movies or what you may have on vhs, they have added 16 mins. of extra scenes. Alot of the features on the dvd is for your computer in fact most of it, the real cool stuff. You can also be the first to watch a high-definition dvd, on your computer which is the original T2. The picture just looks absolutley amazing. I recommend any dvd collector to pick this up.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought this cd when it first came out. I still not tired of it. it is so awesome Evanescence is one of the best  bands ever and i hope they come out with more stuff.
0385504209|1.0|The beginning of the book was good, and I was excited to read it. But as I got farther into it I realized that it was only a not so well disguised attempt to push the author's views against Christianity. My personal opinion is he's trying to do some major kissing up to feminists. From a strictly literary standpoint, his writing was nothing out of the ordinary and he filled many of the pages with his own ideologies. I was also very offended by his blatant attacks on Christians (He potrayed them as being either narrow minded or fools, covering up the \\"truth\\" about Christ)and his seeming glorification of women. He obviously does not know what he is talking about in either of those areas. His views of goddess worship and the like are very far-out. Christiantiy has done more to furthur the good treatment of women than any other religion. And as for all the \\"facts\\" presented in the book, I didn't notice a bibliography listing the sources from which he gathered all this \\"ground-breaking\\" research. I would not reccomend this book to anyone.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Greetings to all the new Zep fans. It's nice to know that my memory of both the Forum and Long Beach Arena concerts is correct. Having been to both shows I was blown away at the time. I'll never forget that during the Long Beach Concert a fan fired a naval flare into the ceiling. The shows was not crowded but that event along with the great music kepted  everyone fired up. I've been living with this group for over 34 years. From the first time I heard them in 1969 I knew this was my favorite all time band. When Bonzo died in 1980 I cried, knowing it was over, but this CD captures the great moments that I will always cherish. Once a Zep fan, always a Zep fan! Long live the KIng!<BR> Pete Saloutos.
B00008K79Q|5.0|This was a fabulous movie, extremely well acted, and even our children (10 and 7) thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was intensely moving and gave insight into terrible policies I had previously known little about.  I think previous reviewers missed the point a little.  This movie, to me, is not about 'good guys' and 'bad guys', but highlights the terrible mistakes and abuses that can come from one group thinking they know what's best for another people.  It is about cultural arrogance.<BR>    My 10 year old is now anxious to read the book and plans to ask her teacher to read it to the class next year. Now THAT's a compliment.
B00008OWZC|3.0|After all the 5 stars I suppose it's inevitable that the music doesn't live up to them. Reasons you might be disappointed: (1) perhaps non-conformist to say but several of the versions here are actually better on The Song Remains The Same (Stairway, Since I've Been Loving You), that album perhaps being better than its reputation suggests (2) the sound is excellent but the mix is strange: Plant too far in the background, Page way too loud and the bass guitar non-existent (3) Page seems to have problems bending his guitar strings, many solos painfully spoilt (to my ear) by out-of-tune bends and dodgy vibrato. The band rocks when they are NOT doing their individual stuff, and the reputation of Bonham is secured for holding them together - he is the real star of the show. A good historical document that Zep fans will love and buy in truck loads.
B00008PC2O|5.0|This review applies to one aspect of the new T2 Extreme DVD.  My friend has a Sony Vaio with an Intel P4, 2GHZ processor and found that by saving the new high definition version to hard drive, he was able to enjoy the film without skips.  He does not recommend pausing the film, but watching straight through to avoid problems.  The movie experience is unlike any other when viewed on his 21&quot; flat trinitron monitor.  If you have a big, fast drive but your video card and cpu are not up to spec, this recommendation might allow you enjoy the hd experience as well!
B00000K31Q|5.0|The way the original Shakespaerean dialogues are seamlessly combined with some of the funniest lines I've ever heard is amazing. The characters and plot are very well developed, and this in a genre that is not known for that (teen films).
0812932293|4.0|Richard Branson is founder and chairman of the Virgin Group, which is probably one of the world's most diversified companies. It has businesses ranging from music records and mobile phones through to balloon-flying and bridal services. This book is split up into 28 short chapters and a epilogue.<br />The book starts initially with Branson's failed around-the-world-ballooning attempt in Morocco in January 1997, before starting at his childhood. Richard Branson was born in the South of England in 1950, which is where he grew most of his childhood. &quot;My childhood is something of a blur to me now, but there are several episodes that stand out. I remember that my parents continually set challenges for us.&quot; During his time at a big public secondary school started thinking up schemes to make money. These schemes ranged from growing Christmas trees and breeding budgies; most of them leading nowhere. Eventually, his schoolfriend Jonny and Richard wanted to set up an alternative magazine aimed at students. &quot;The first issue of 'Student' was published in January 1968.&quot; This led to them setting up a music shop, leading to a record label, and eventually leading to one of the largest privately-owned companies in the world. Each of the different events is discussed in detail, while written in an novel-type style.<br />I normally do not read autobiographies, since I think most of them are &quot;ego-trips&quot;. Not this one however, I was surprised how honest Richard Branson was about his not always successful private life and business ventures. Since this book was first published in 1998, the life of Richard Branson has not been standing still. Therefore, be prepared for Volume II of the Sir Richard Branson-story. And I must admit that I cannot wait.
B00005JLEU|5.0|As a big Miyazaki fan, it probably goes without saying that I really enjoyed this movie. The movie is not a rehash of previous Miyazaki stuff at all. While Chihiro is reminiscent of both Kiki and Satsuki from Mimi o Sumaseba, there's an appearance of the makuro kurosukes (originally from Totoro) and the atmosphere a bit reminiscent of Mononoke Hime, this movie makes you think much more than any of the previous Miyazaki films. There are many layers of meaning and symbolism in the film, and it joins a short list of anime classics like Akira, Lain and Metropolis which cannot be fully appreciated without viewing several times.

0060005424|5.0|I give this book a low five because I have a few grips about this book, but its still a five. Finally Garth Nix explains what separates the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. He gives us a brief explanation of the nine and what they had to do with the charter stones, which by the way, was truly unique.<BR>I truly love Lirael, she was a daughter of the Clayr who tried so desperately to have the sight. She didn't want to be a misfit because she was so unlike the other members of the Clayr. Garth really portrayed her character well. All in all, this book had pretty much keep up my interest.<BR>Now, my grips on the book. I hated the fact that this book totally took place 14 years into the future after Sabriel. We find out that Touchstone & Sabriel are now married with kids!!! What happened during the 14 years? Are we ever going to find out? I probably wouldn't be interest about what happened during the 14 years, but I hate to read books where favorite characters are talking about brief adventures that happened in the past that weren't in a published book. Another grip is the kids of Touchstone and Sabriel. Prince Sameth is a total wimp and his sister is a spoiled brat!! I totally hated reading about them especially Sameth until he meet up with Lirael in the end. He ended up being a different character but I still didn't like him. Other than my grips about this book I feel this is a good story and well written. I feel Garth Nix had a good Trilogy on this hands. Now, onward to Abhorsen the third book!!!
0679777547|3.0|My first thought when setting out to write this review was, 'Hmmm, I wonder how many irrelevant and obscure titles I can work into the review, that may or may not shed some light on the subject matter at hand?'<br />I am a fairly well-read person (I am told I am too modest, and that I qualify as a very well read person, but I don't want to claim too much, lest some diabolic force leap forward to claim me back for my sin of pride, a particularly bad thing for those of holy orders, as every guide and advice to the priestly states since the days of Irenaeus). But I digress.<br />But this is in keeping with the flavour of the novel. Unless you like digression, stay far away (run, don't walk!) from this novel. But, if you go in for the seemingly endless, barely understandable and eventually irrelevant, then by all means, this is the book for you.<br />I would not have read this book but for the urgings of friends who were similarly reading this, and wanted to compare notes. Thanks, guys!<br />Now, I must hasten to add at this point, I did find myself enjoying the book several times. I don't mind the digressions, but I found the attempts (subtle but there) to equate Corso with a Holmesian character unconvincing (and the attempts were subtle enough that Perez-Reverte could claim they aren't actually there). Apart from Holmes, he ignores most of English literature--when he talks of those who wrote in serial form, i.e, Stendahl et alia, he neglects those such as Dickens.<br />I would love to have the card catalogue Perez-Reverte was sitting next to as he wrote this; perhaps he used Amazon.com and other internet searching to add that final irrelevant entry in each of the listings of books.<br />I am a bibliophile. I sit in a room, such as Perez-Reverte describes in several places, where shelves sag on walls groaning from the strain of heavy books, heavy in content as well as mass weight. I have several such rooms in my home. But I couldn't quite find the same love of books in this book, where sometimes bibliophilia was a fetish, and other times a useless detail.<br />Basic plot--is it a murder or is it a suicide? What does the manuscript have to do with it? Dumas (who wrote, among other things, the stories involving the Musketeers) is seemingly at the centre of things, along with a possibly-phoney book of occult forbidden knowledge, for which men will die (obviously) or kill. There is diabolic force at work, maybe. Corso is the rare-books expert called in to investigate the case, who doesn't always like the role of policeman.<br />Perez-Reverte seems intent on impressing us with his erudition in the field of literature and continental travel. It would be impressive if it were consistent and organised along better lines, and woven into a story where such details made a contribution. This book, as a mystery, fails to deliver because it both gives more information than is necessary (which can be an effective device, forcing the reader to separate 'the wheat from the chaff', or figure out which strands to follow; sadly, that is not the case here) and insufficient information in the strands which count to allow the reader to 'figure it out' (another sin, often difficult to avoid when one is trying for a 'complex' novel; even Conan Doyle frequently failed on this point).<br />In all, this is an inventive idea, with interesting character formation; for some reason, neither the story nor the characters get developed sufficiently (either in size or direction) to make this a first-class novel.<br />The New York Daily News described this book as 'A cross between Umberto Eco and Anne Rice' (Eco is very prominent here, as Perez-Reverte is obviously trying to emulate and cash in on Eco's prominence in the richer-and-book-purchasing English-speaking world). The New Yorker gets even more, well, New-Yorker-ish: 'A noir metafiction [please someone, tell me just what that means, in English??] Even a reader armed with a Latin dictionary and a copy of The Three Musketeers cannot anticipate the thrilling twists of this stylish, Escher-like mystery.'<br />Perhaps one of the reasons one cannot anticipate 'the thrilling twists' is the inconsistency in the novel? Just a thought.<br />Escher-like...well, yes, you read one thing and it turns out to be another (for instance, I thought I was reading a great novel, and it turned out to be...)<br />No, that is unfair. It is worth reading, but not devoting much time toward. Use as a diversion, not a devotional.  I won't spoil the ending for you. I don't like it when others do that for me.

B00005JLD4|4.0|I won't gush on and on about the excellent movie. I want to bring your attention to the \\"Making of\\" documentary. So often these are thrown onto a DVD as a \\"bonus\\", but amount to nothing more than a refried re-telling of the film. Here, instead, we are treated to forty-five minutes of how Philip Noyce selected his three young actresses, and all the trials and tribulations that entailed. The scene in the film of the three children being taken from their mothers is a very heart-wrenching scene. But, moving beyond compare is that same scene as caught by the \\"making of\\" cameras during and after the shoot. Many of the people behind the cameras were in tears during the actual filming of the scene. At the end of the scene, the character mothers are on the ground crying and Noyce yells, \\"CUT!\\". He looks down and you can hear the actresses still crying. He looks up and around the camera with a puzzled look on his face to see if perhaps the actresses did not hear him yell, \\"CUT\\". They are all still on the ground sobbing, and he has to go over to console them, saying \\"Woa, Woa, Woa...\\" to calm them down and bring them out of it because everyone was so drawn into the event they were reenacting they forgot they were only filming a scene. That was very moving to see how the girls and women were so affected by the filming of that scene. Insights such as this are what make the \\"Making of\\" documentary actually worth watching after the film itself.
0316666343|1.0|I had to see what was supposed to be so great about this best-selling book. Honestly, nothing is great about this book. A good story is something that makes you to go from page to page. This book was a boring read. It could have ended ten chapters earlier. I do not recommend this book at all.
B000068OCS|5.0|One of the greatest peices of cinematic art of alltime. No other film will stick with you quite like Koyaanisqatsi. You will be enthralled by the organism that is industrial society. This film reveals many chilling revelations which up untill its release were never challenged or touched upon. Realization of this beast we have created. Many pounder the meaning and motives of this film. The answer is simply the title. Not the evils of man or hope for another way merely life out of balance. Reggio is truly one of the most influencial directors of our time. The soundtrack on the other hand is a disapointment. I must give Phillip Glass credit but his work in many ways cheapens the film. Mute your TV and put on radiohead's OK computer. It goes perfectly with the mood of the film. Boards of Canada's Geogaddi and Any Godspeed you black emperor record will go very well also.definately still as powerful today as when it was released 20 years ago.
B000002IPZ|5.0|Souls Of Black is an awesome album by Testament. Chuck Billy delivers an amazing vocal perfromance, Alex and Eric deliver another awesome rythm guitar assault. Alex's solos are still amazing. And the drums and bass blend everything perfectly together. In my mind Testament could do no wrong with the lineup of Chuck, Eric, Alex, Louie, and Greg. It was to bad things had to change after The Ritual. If you enjoyed The Legacy, The New Order, and Practice What You Preach, I am sure you will like this album as well. Testament are an awesome band and will remain one of my favorites. This album along with there first three are classic thrash, and classic Testament. Buy it.
0064471837|5.0|If I had to choose a favorite book, it would be either Sabriel or Lirael. Sabriel isn't at all cliche, but it has magic, a combination I heartily approve of. The characters are good, although I wish we knew more about Sabriel's father. Even if there is little explaination about the history of this world in this book, we know enough. Also, I really like that there is a sequel, but you can choose whether or not to read it, it's not like Lirael's just a continuation of Sabriel, although Abhorsen is only a continuation of Lirael, and I dislike it for that.
B00009ATIX|5.0|It seems as if this movie is one of those love it or hate it ones. Both sides of those opinions seem to be well explained in other reviews, so I will be brief.<br />The silence, slow pace, wonderful score, dream scenes, unspoken words, symbolism with the door nob and Solaris, the character Snow, and the real meaning of the film (\\"We want mirrors\\" even if those mirrors are inaccurate) add up to a film that is not typically made by Hollywood.<br />You can compare this film to the book or to the Tarkovsky version, but all three were made by different people for different reasons, therefore I am comparing it as a movie against other movies I have viewed, and I think it's beautiful.
0060278250|2.0|I kinda liked some of the writing, but I really felt that there was just a tiny bit of plot for a long book.  As a friend and fellow Garth Nix lover said, \\"I feel like all of Abhorsen could have been put into two chapters at the end of Lirael.\\"  I would have to agree with that.  I mean, the characters got worse, if anything, the ending was boring and predictable, and the villian seemed nonexistant, so unreal was he.  The only good thing about this book was how it delved deeper into Death.  That was interesting, and made the difference between one star and two.  Trust me on this: don't waste your money on this book.  It's really not worth it
B000084T18|4.0|How tired I am of people bleating on about less mainstream artists e.g Jurassic 5 and The Roots. Yes they are good hip hop artists, but just because an album is more mainsteam doesn't mean it is bad. This album will be regarded as a classic in a few years time. It has everything you want from a rap album, it relies on the basics, beats and lyrics, and both live up to the hype. True, we have heard the stories and seen the image before, but rarely do we see or hear it from someone who has genuinely lived this type of life, and that is why this album is different. 50 Cent was destined to make it big and Eminem and Dre have realised this. Watch out for 'In Da Club', 'Many Men', 'Patiently Waiting' and 'Wanksta'. This album is a must. Buy it.
B000001G5A|5.0|I'm very glad I chose to buy this performance of this particular Mozart masterpiece. I knew that Bohm is somewhat notorious for his slower pacing, but I have a variety of Bohm recordings --of other composers-- and they provided a sturdy foundation to support my choice. If anything the slowness is better; I was never troubled by it, and it's a benefit on the long/er run.<BR>The depth is astounding.<BR>Incredibly moving and profound. <BR>Give Bohm a chance, please. Do yourself a favor. The rewards are high. You can also sample the Karajan version, though I doubt that you'll stick with that one after hearing this one --multiple times, mind you {high volume is advised}.<BR>Best of luck with your decision...
B000002H72|5.0|WOW!!!!  Never have I heard anything stay so catchy and so great as Doolittle does.  This album is a masterpiece when put in the rock category.  I don't like heavey metal, never have, but this CD is such a great.....man....I can't explain in words how good this CD is.  It starts with the magnificent \\"DEBASER,\\" ands with the cool \\"Gouge Away.\\"  This album (in my opinion) has to filler tracks, all these songs are Killer!!!!  Frank Black has a voice that whispers something and then suddenly screams out vocals that I have never heard performed so brilliantly.  If you want to start with the Pixies (which you should) buy this or Surfer Rosa, those are two good staters.  If you like pop/rock and heavy rock, these CD is good to get.  LOL, I don't like heavy rock, BUT I LOVE THIS!!!!!  BUY IT!!!! \\"Want to grow up to be...be a debaser (debaser) .........\\"
B00000K3D4|5.0|Got better and better during my first watching of this classic piece of Fantasy. That says much. At first I had very slight feelings that this might turn out to be much more suitable for a 'younger' audience; I'm currently 21 and not interested in child-like shallowness. Fortunately it turned out to work on multiple levels {Oh, this sounds dumb, but I assure you it had little to do with Jennifer, though she's just about ***}.<BR>Very fine movie made with incredible care and knowledge.<BR>Now, I don't know if some parts of this movie were meant to be funny, but I laughed quite a bit. Too many good things to list here, though, but everything with the 'noble' dog-rider was great. The whole feature was a pleasure to watch.<BR>The singing was _not_ distracting, though this was the thing that made me doubt about it all.<BR>Deserves its classic status.<BR>Children will love it, I think.<BR>Have fun!
B00004R99L|5.0|I first viewed this film at age four (its 1951 premiere showing). The film was then a pure joy, and I still regard it as one of Walt's underrated masterpieces. <br />Some say that Alice doesn't have &quot;heart&quot; (including Walt himself!), but I disagree. The Alice character, as represented in this movie, is indeed true to the mood of the original story. Certainly, this Disney version is a greatly truncated amalgam of Carroll's &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; and his &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, but the result is charming and an example of animation art at its most imaginative.<br />I strongly recommend this film on DVD. Please be aware that Disney has tentatively scheduled a &quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD release of this movie in early 2004, so you might wish to wait awhile.
B00008G9JO|2.0|There are, of course, worthy pop musicians (Leonard Cohen, for example) who never achieve mass popularity as well as worthless pop musicians who do. Nor is it uncommon for pop musicians who achieve mass popularity eventually to lose it--either gradually or abruptly.<br />A remarkable, and much remarked on, thing about Jethro Tull is that it achieved its greatest popularity without U.S. singles or AM radio play. In fact, its first and only #1 album, &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; was, in fact, NOT an album, but a single song--only #1 album, that is, excepting &quot;A Passion Play&quot; which achieved #1 status briefly (for a single week). Jethro Tull followers felt themselves a party apart from the followers of AM rock groups such as The Guess Who, Steppenwolf, and The Doors, and even, for that matter, from the followers of The Rolling Stones and The Who. (This distinction will mean little to those who don't know how radio and the &quot;music industry&quot; have changed drastically since the late sixties and early seventies. Formerly &quot;underground&quot; FM rock stations were replaced with corporate-controlled FM rock stations. Single 45 r.p.m. vinyl discs ceased to exist. In 1996 Congress removed the restriction preventing a single company from owning more than forty radio stations; now fifty percent of the radio stations in the country are controlled by only two companies.)<br />These Jethro Tull followers were wary when Jethro Tull finally had a U.S. hit single, &quot;Living in the Past&quot; in 1973. There were, however, extenuating circumstances. &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, the album from which it came, was a retrospective compilation of out-takes and samples, and it was reported that the group had released it to meet their contractual obligation since &quot;A Passion Play&quot; was taking longer to put together than anticipated. In any case, &quot;Living in the Past&quot;, the song,  was pleasant and tasteful, if also very simple and obviously indebted to&quot;Take Five&quot;, by way of the theme from &quot;Mission Impossible&quot;. <br />&quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot; was a different story. Here we had a tasteless APPARENT attempt to cash-in on Jethro Tull's popularity and sell-out its first audience, its grassroots followers. To cut to the chase, it is not JUST that Jethro Tull's popularity fell off and continued to fall off as the seventies wore on, it is also that to a considerable extent one Jethro Tull audience was replaced by another. In light of this, the relatively poor sales of &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; has more than commercial significance. In a nutshell, &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; is not an essential Jethro Tull album.
6305327084|5.0|It's refreshing to watch a movie cast with (at least some) people of ordinary looks and parts that address some ordinary frustrations of life.  What makes a story good to me is one that believably speaks to the greatness of the human spirit, even if it is set in the midst of small-town and boring-life problems.  Add in some characters that one can identify with, and really like, and you have a good story.  And that is why I liked this movie.  As another writer said, Natalie Portman steals the show even without many lines as an endearing and crackerjack-smart thirteen year old.  But her few lines are gems.  Timothy Hutton is a great actor and her great counterpoint.  Even if you don't buy it, rent it and enjoy.
B00008PX8P|5.0|If your not a studio musician and did not here BONZO live in studio, back in the early 70's do not respond negatively..
B00005JKZV|5.0|Great movie, great visuals, and the battle at Helm's Deep is spectacular.  My only complaint is Peter Jackson's straying from the book, which becomes more pronounced here than in \\"The Fellowship of the Ring.\\"  In the book, the people of Rohan are noble and great warriors.  In the movie, they're essentially some mopey wimps, who fight because they have to, and aren't really that good at it.  This is sad, because the book really establishes them as major and important characters to the story line, especially Theoden and Eomer, but they're really relegated to minor characters in the movie.  A pity.
B00005JLSE|5.0|No wonder why it won best picture at the oscars!  This movie is at the top of my favorites list.  If you're not one who likes musicals like this, see it anyway-it's worth it.  Catherine Zeta-Jones blows you away in a nother one of her phenominal performances (best sup. actress oscar win) Queen Latifah shines (sup. actress nom) John C. Reilly is great as usual (best sup. actor nom) and Renee Zellwegger surprises you with her brilliant performance.  Nobody could have played Billy Flynn better than Richard Gere.  I paid to see this movie six times.  Don't miss this movie.  It's one of the best.
B00008LDPU|4.0|The Animatrix is a collection of visually stunning works.  If you're a fan of The Matrix, then the animated shorts presented here are well worth the purchase.  The shorts expand and further define the world of The Matrix, and each of the shorts is done in a different and unique style.  Some of the shorts may appear to be odd or make little sense, but I have found that most of the people who have trouble grasping the concepts have difficulty with the concepts of The Matrix anyway.
B00000K19E|5.0|If you're the type of person who'd want excitement, then \\"The Matrix\\" is the one for you.  It's got action, adventure, and heart-pounding entertainment.  <br />This thriller, as well as its sequals, tell one story: a futuristic world controlled by artificial intelligence, all depending on humans beings as their power source.  To control our lives, these A.I. have created \\"The Matrix\\", an ultimate system which has created a computer generated world where we can live in.  But while living in the seemingly real world of the Matrix, human beings are blindingling living a life that does not really exist, living a life without physical or mental freedom.<br />But are human beings to be under the control of the Matrix?  Only the so-called \\"One\\" can free humanity from the evil Matrix, but who is this \\"One\\"?  In \\"The Matrix\\", Keanu Reeves and Lawrence Fishburne star as heroes trying to free mankind from the Matrix.  Keanu Reeves is Neo, who, by day, works for a computer company, but by night, he's a computer hacker.  Sitting by his seat and using the computer has led him to contact with Morpheus (Fishburne), an opponent of the Matrix.  With the help of Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) Morpheus is able to free Neo from the Matrix.  But is Neo the \\"One\\" who will free all humanity from the Matrix?<br />\\"The Matrix\\" is a combination of karate, action, and sci-fi.  It includes state-of-the-art special effects that will blow you away.  This movie's depiction of the futuristic \\"real world\\" (our world) was both stunning and disturbing.  Its action scenes were are wonderous to behold.  The way Neo dodges bullets is a memorable scene.  Its storyline is very catchy and interesting!  Our world is actually a hoax?  Whoa!  Dodging bullets, running really fast, jumping really high, and doing impossible things?  Cool!<br />Overall, \\"The Matrix\\" is a fiml for movie lovers out there.  This movie is a sci-fi classic.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|This band has that unique sound that hauntly seems to permeate every album since the 1970's. However, I think this album is a stunning combination of Future Games, Bare Trees, Rumours, and Stevie Nick's latest album Trouble in Shangri-La all rolled up into one compelling compilation.<br />I actually continue to like their music more and more with each new release and each passing year. This could be one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time from start to finish.
B000066NW0|4.0|I normally don't write reviews but I noted all the negative reviews and just want to say cut the kid a break.  I'm 34, yes 34, and listen to alot of music from many different artists and there is alot of junk out there, I've listened to her CD and and must say Avril has what it takes, give her a few more years to mature I am sure the naysayers will think differently.  Her efforts receive a well deserved 4 stars.  Look forward to her future releases.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I heard Christina give the absolutely most amazing live performance of the song Beautiful (and Impossible) at the American Music Awards (AMA). It was frankly the best live vocal performance I have ever heard. Many singers are great studio performers but they have trouble singing on stage. But, wow, can Christina really sing live.<br />However, I don't appreciate her &quot;hardcore extreme&quot; songs and dress sense. I found the MTV video of Beautiful a little too weird and jarring too. But I find the cruel jokes and ridicule that people make about her - esp from SNL: Saturday Night Live - disgusting. She's very young, she's naive, she comes from a broken home. In short, She doesn't know better. Judging from her heart felt rendition of the song &quot;Beautiful&quot; - I suspect she must be going through a lot.<br />But if they release a DVD version of her performance at the AMA. I'd get it. I think I'd also get the single instead of the album.
B000002JOH|5.0|Hey, I could care less about all this \\"who's really metal\\" stuff everyone is spewing. It's bad enough having to listen to punks whine about who's punk, gimme a break.<br />This is really a great, solid album. It's definitely Pantera's most accessible work, but don't let that make you think it's soft or made-for-radio. It basically means that the songs have more traditional structure than you might find in their other albums. Very listenable rather than random-sounding experimentation like you might find in other metal albums.<br />Now, I'm not a pure metal fan, but I do like Metallica, Napalm Death and Sepultura... also Motorhead is one of my all-time favorite bands. I don't know what you guys call \\"metal\\" but I also love AC/DC and Black Sabbath. I'm more of a punk guy, metal as a genre tends to get a bit grating but there are some gems out there... and I think this is one of them. Hopefully that puts my opinion in perspective.<br />I like music that's energetic and anthemic, and gets you moving. I also like a lot of talent in the band, and I think Diamond is a great guitarist... BEING A GUITARIST MYSELF, anyone who is saying he [is bad]is out of their mind. People who complain about Philip's screaming... it is very high quality screaming and he does hit notes... do the Fourier transform and see for yourself. Those people just want to hear Metallica sing a ballad. Pantera are also amazingly fast, just a great energetic band. The lyrics are fairly cool in places but can be a bit offensive, but that's more of a warning than anything... it takes a LOT to offend me and it doesn't bother me.<br />I have a couple Pantera albums and this is the best from among them, \\"Far Beyond Driven\\" is also good but not as \\"even\\" as this one.

B00005JM1F|5.0|While not one of the most brillant films of the year, Old School was definitely one of the funniest and most satisfying films made. Will Ferrell is excellent whenever he's on screen, and Vince Vaughn (Trent from Swingers) is also hilarious (earmuffs!). I'll buy it just because it had some of the funniest one liners I've heard in a while, which were repeated God-knows-how-many-times the day after it was released. This is a great movie to see with a couple of friends after partying (hence the fact that it is a party film).
B00003CXZ4|4.0|This movie is amazing but lets give credit where credit is due.  This movie is a rip off (albiet an amazing one) of the classic \\"backwards\\" Sienfield episode which came before it.<br />Guy Pierce rocks,,,,,and Carrie Ann Moss shows she can be more than a Karate Kid in leather.  I do think this movie has been overembraced by the public because it is so trendy to like anything different,  Originality should be appreciated for what it is, not because it is hip to appreciate it,
B00000JLWW|5.0|I mean, what can i say rather than: Titanic is the best movie ever. It might take years to release a movie as good as this one. Its DVD features are remarcable. I have the Titanic DVD movie, and let me tell you it is out of the hook. I watched the movie about 20 times and i still love it. I recommend everyone to buy this movie. James Cameron ROCKS!!
6304493681|1.0|It's only fair that I start by saying I generally do not like Anime.  In fact, the only anime I've ever liked was The Animatrix.  This movie is nothing like that.  But based on its great reviews by critics and \\"amateurs\\" alike, I decided to give it a shot.  It starts off a bit too quickly for me, diving into strangely named organizations, devices, etc.  I tried from the first moment of the film to just watch and hope I'd understand it more as it went along, but I never really did get it.  About 15-20 minutes into the movie, I actually fell asleep (and I wasn't tired when I put the movie in the DVD player).  I tried again another night before returning the movie (a rental) but just couldn't keep my eyes and mind on it.  It was just the usual anime littany of huge eyes, oddly shadowy faces, inexplicably naked heroines, and the like.  If you like anime, I'm sure from the reviews I've read that you'll love this movie also.  But if you don't like it much, I'd recommend renting it before you jump in and buy.

B000002KKK|5.0|I think that on DEGUELLO, ZZ TOP was really firing on all cylinders. I just love this album. It is a slab of now frills blues based rock music that keeps the listener hooked in to the songs. All the songs here rock, I cant find any filler material here. On this album, we have the classic tracks I'M BAD, I'M NATIONWIDE, CHEAP SUNGLASSES, and I THANK YOU. Those 3 songs are reason enough to buy this album. The good songs dont stop there however, if you want more good music, I suggest that you listen to DUST MY BROOM, A FOOL FOR YOUR STOCKINGS, MANIC MECAHNIC. Like I said earlier, there isnt a single song on this album that doesnt rock, and I like listening to the whole album. If you are a fan of real music, than ZZ TOP is a band whose music you should have.
B00003CXAE|2.0|with no black people in it anywhere? How does that work, exactly? As for the movie, pedestrian, high school theater fodder. There it is.
B00008LDPU|2.0|Rented this cheap at the local supermarket...to see what it was and glad I did. Basically nine short films done anime-style or with CGI (Final Flight of the Osiris, first one).<br />I just found the whole thing boring. Found myself fast-forwarding to skip past the overdone imagery to see the nine stories unfold. Not really that much to \\"watch,\\" even for a short film. Some of the voice acting is awful and clichéd when it's there. Mostly there isn't any voice, just the visuals and music.<br />Those who LOVE anime that skimps on voicework will love this. Everyone else looking for some cool action (and drama sub-text, as in the case of Matrix Reloaded or even M1) will probably find this a real snooze.
B000002ADT|5.0|What can you say about Miles Davis. I remember when I was in a music store and buying the tape. I still have that tape but, it's kind of worn out. Okay, let me tell you about the content. This album is just a masterpiece. I love it. My favorite song on this album is So What. I just relax when I hear it. The sassy trumpet sounds and the sleepy saxaphone sounds coming out of John Coltrane's sax just takes me to another place in time. All Blues, is great. It makes you think a whole lot. You can get your stress out. You can find these tracks on the new Columbia box set. The first time I heard this tape, I didn't know that John Coltrane was playing on some of the material, I just thought Gil Evans was directing it. And one more thing I didn't no about this album: it was released in the late 50's. Let me tell you something, when my tape goes out, I'm going to get the remastered disc. Blue In Green is great. If you ever listen to it, your'e be surpised of what your'e going to hear. Please don't get this on vinyl. Your'e going to love the mastering they have done to the tape and especially the compact disc. I think that if love the world of jazz, you should buy it. Hey, I'm just starting to love jazz.
B000005IU2|5.0|I LOVE this album. It is soooo good. It is much less structured and more wild then the first album. This album has more raw power than \\"Raw Power\\". \\"Dirt\\" is a great slower-paced jam that is easy to relate to on a bad day. \\"1970\\" is a loud romp with a lot of iggy yowls...which is definately NOT a bad thing...More screams can be found on \\"L.A. blues\\" which isthe band playing even louder than normal...that's pretty loud...It's just loud primal rock and roll, what more can you ask for?...This album can also lead to exploration of other genres since its more diverse with the jazz and funk influences. Basically this album owns!!!
0380977788|4.0|This book is the exception.  I've sampled Gaiman's work previously -- both his comics and prose novels -- and have generally been unable to understand the appeal of the man's work.  \\"Coraline\\" is the first of his works I've read that I can begin to see the appeal.<br />The book is a wonderful tale about a young girl's triumph over evil forces to win back her parents.  Very enjoyable, although some portions may be a bit too frightening for younger readers.
0385504209|3.0|I was taken in by the wonderful reviews of this book but the farther I read, the more disappointed I was. The writing is no better than a college creative writing course. Each chapter ends with some &quot;cliffhanger&quot; setup to get you to read the next chapter. Many times the supense is simply manufactured and not inherent in the plot details. In my opinion, the author was really writing a slightly disguised screenplay. I continued to read thru to the end mostly because I had not heard some of the quasi-religious &quot;theories&quot; that were presented. There has been some recent controversy on the basic plot possibly being a re-cycle of another book by a different author, but Brown's publisher has dismissed the similarities as purely conincidental.  All in all, I am surprised that this book is at the top of the best-seller lists. It reflects the relentless downhill trend of American culture and the continued bad influence of popular TV and video games on writing in general.
B000002MTU|5.0|I have been a Clapton fan for about 30 years. I own around 15 albums from different periods of his career, including the box set Crossroads. This has become one of my favorite albums of his to listen to. He got back to the blues, and played the Hell out his guitar. It is a shame that he has retired from touring, but I hope he still continues to make music like this.
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is absolutley beautiful, when I first heard it I knew what all the hype was about. The whole album flows together wonderfully, it is one giant party, the lyrics and music go together beautfully. You can here the hang over in the music BUY THIS ALBUM
B00004VXF2|5.0|Metal Machine Music could quite possible be the worst album of all time. Yet, it is quite possbily the greatest concept for an album of all time. Only Lou Reed could release a double LP of guitar feedback and get away with it. No one could listen to this album seriously, and if you can, you must be on acid, and about to commit suicide. Lou Reed is on the brink of either A) Insanity B) Absolute Genius. My vote goes for the latter.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club was an excellent movie. The movie is definitely one to purchase because you will want to watch it several times over. You can relate to the Ed Norton character and also see who you want to be in the Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) character. The supporting cast really helps in adding to this cinematic classic as well. If you enjoy the movie I would also recommend reading the book, which is a bit more descriptive.
B00008PC2O|2.0|Ok, let's get started. In my opinion this DVD has far more negatives for me than the positives. The movie entertained me(still has after a million times) but let's face it, when i bought this i thought this was going to be better than the Ultimate Edition DVD. Hence the name Extreme Ed. Boy was I wrong. This was one of my least favourite DVD purchases. Don't get me wrong, the movie is great and its iconic but the DVD, just isn't up to par with me. I will love the audio commentary though. I love commentary btw. That's one of the reason's I buy DVD's. I didn't even know the Extreme Ed. had commentary...
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin's self-titled DVD is a treasure chest for all fans of the band.  Nearly four hours of never before seen concert footage is spread out over two disks that feature performances from every era of the band's career.  It is a real eye opener for fans who never experienced the band live to see the sheer power and magnetism of the group at the height of their powers.  The best aspect of the collection is the brilliant sound and picture clarity.  Jimmy Page spearheaded this project and although surviving members Robert Plant and John Paul Jones contributed, Mr. Page is the lifeblood of the work.  The remastering of the footage's sound and picture is breathtaking.  One only need to view the four songs from the Madison Square Garden concert to see the first rate work.  This is footage from a concert that was filmed for the band's 1976 film, The Song Remains The Same.  In viewing that movie, the picture is somewhat grainy and the colors blurred, but on this disk, the picture is sharp and clear.  Led Zeppelin sold tons of albums in the 70's, but it was their legendary live performances that made them rock gods and this collection brings that view into focus.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was at one of the Seattle concerts in 1972 - my first rock concert at the ripe old age of 13.  I had quite literally never seen or heard anything like Led Zeppelin - from Robert Plant's piercing wails to Jimmy Page's solos and violin bowing to John Paul Jones' relentless bass rhythms to John Bonham's merciless drum pounding.  This CD reminds me of why that night made me a lifelong Zep head.<br />To some, the long solos and improvisations may seem sloppy or self-indulgent, but it's what made every concert a unique gem - so different from the overly staged and choreographed concerts we see nowadays.  And the music - combinations of folk, blues, oldtime rock n roll imbibed with a hard electric edge.  Nothing was sacred, any style was fair game and any song could be worked and reworked to create ever-changing panoramas of sound.  Whole Lotta Love is a particularly stellar example of their improvisational style in action.<br />Thanks, Jimmy, for bringing it all back live for both old and new fans!
B00005JLT5|5.0|Roman Polanski's The Pianist is the real life story of Wladyslaw Szpilman who was a Polish Jew who survived the Nazi occupation of Poland.  Adrien Brody plays Szpilman and he gives a star-making performance.  Szpilman is a concert pianist who plays on Polish radio and as the film begins he is playing on the radio when the area of Warsaw the station is in is bombed.  The Szpilman family is defiant at first towards the news of the German occupation, but then like all Jewish families, they are forced to follow the strict rules the Nazis set forth regarding Jews.  They are made to move from their spacious and homey apartment into a [cramped], run down space in the designated Jewish ghetto.  The family struggles for money, but Wladyslaw is still able to play piano in a Jewish restaurant for meager earnings.  Eventually the family is in line to be sent to a concentration camp, but through sheer fate, Wladyslaw is pulled from the line boarding the train and is spared certain death.  He then spends time working a slave laborer building the wall separating the Jewish section of Warsaw from the rest of the city.  Again, he escapes through the gracious help of others and through the underground resistance is kept hid in an apartment away from detection.  Although free from the ghetto, he is a prisoner in the apartment and at the mercy of others.  He is facing starvation when he is forced to flee the apartment when it is bombed.  He hides out in a hospital for a while and eventually ends up in the bombed out ruins of Warsaw.  It is while he is hiding in the ruins that he again faces almost certain death when he is discovered by a German officer, Captain Hosenfeld (Thomas Kretschmann).  Hosenfeld speaks with him and asks what Szpilman's profession was and Szpilman replies he is a pianist.  There happens to be a piano in the house and Hosenfeld makes Szpilman play.  Szpilman plays a gorgeous piece and Hosenfeld is moved to spare Szpilman's life.  He brings him food and when the Germans are retreating from the Russians, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his coat to keep warm.  It is the exchange between Hosenfeld and Szpilman that is the heart of the film and shows that despite the horror of war and the atrocities of the Nazis, that the true spirit of humanity can still shine through.  Ironically, Szpilman survived the war and went on to continue his career as a pianist and Hosenfeld ended up a prisoner in a Russian war camp where he died several years after the war ended.  Mr. Brody is incredible in his part.  His facial expressions convey the sense of fear and hopelessness that Szpilman must have felt through his tragic journey.  Never once does go over the top, it a truly genuine performance.  Mr. Polanski also does a brilliant job of directing.  He details the senseless brutality and omnipresence of the German occupation of Poland, but never sinks into gratuitous violence.  The film was nominated for seven academy awards including Best Picture.  Both Mr. Brody and Mr. Polanski scored unexpected, but richly deserved Oscars for Best Actor and Best Director respectively and Ronald Harwood won the film's third Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay.ermans are retreating from the Russians, Hosenfeld gives Szpilman his coat to keep warm.

1587990717|3.0|I read a very well written article about this guy in the New Yorker.  He has one really good idea, but had to pad it out to sell it as a book.<br />I read over 1/2 of this book at Barnes and Noble and didn't buy it -- There is something to be said for ghostwriting.<br />The good idea -- very improbable events are inappropriately priced in financial markets -- is very hard to turn into cash.<br />I think a major problem with this generally valid insight is that you have to be able to both collect and to spend the money.  That is, counter parties have to still have the ability to pay in cases of financial meltdowns.  In terms of non financial catastrophes -- war, biological disaster, nuclear disaster, earthquakes -- it doesn't matter if you have zillions of puts on some stock or other financial instrument.<br />The secret of Warren Buffet is simply his ability to determine the appropriate price for a business or part of a business, and buy low, and sell high.  In other words, to do good deals.  That was also the major strength of Jack Welch -- he bought better businesses -- his various rules led him away from capital intensive commodity and capital intensive businesses, and toward better ones -- no auto's or steelmills for Jack.<br />Seems like skill to me.<br />Anyway, I would like to turn this insight into some money, but don't really have a clue.<br />I would really rather be lucky in non financial areas of life.
6304539258|5.0|This movie is a lot better than any Star Trek movie would ever be and this isn't even the best one.I think it is cool that George Lucas released this one first so you will have to wait to find out who Ben Kanobi is and who Leia really is and how Luke came to be.All the charecters are great in this movie as well, my favorite is Han Solo.<br /> This movie has a great story line and I like how all the charecters are developed and I love all the vilians like Darth Vador and all the Stormtroopers.It's just awesome.<br /> This plot turns all different turns and I'm not saying that in a bad way, it actually makes sence.<br /> I would tell you to buy this off amazon but you could also buy the trilogy, you could see my reviews for them.<br /> I reccomend this movie.
B00007KQA3|2.0|If I had known this DVD version was going to have a different soundtrack than the original U.S. release, I would not have purchased it! With all due respect for the director Michael Radford, the Eurythmics soundtrack is what makes this movie very, very good, in a disturbing way. I agree with other reviewers that MGM should have provided the option to choose the soundtrack. And frankly, I don't think customers should have to read about others disappointments in DVD purchases before clicking the BUY button. If the Eurythmics were not going to be featured on the soundtrack it should have been made very obvious in the ad. In fact the DVD case and the movie titles say music by Eurythmics and Dominic Muldowney! This seems to be happening a lot with DVD's. Movies hit the theaters, people fall in love with them as they are originally seen, then DVD's are sold with changes from the way they were first seen and remembered. This becomes infuriating given the cost of DVD's especially when replacing VHS tapes and getting stuck with a changed movie. I purchased this \\"1984\\" DVD for the Eurythmics musical score, as well as the movie itself and it's two great actors Richard Burton and John Hurt. I understand the VHS tape version has the Eurythmics soundtrack, therefore I recommend it over the DVD.<br />Aside from that, having read the book several times, the movie is an excellent adaptation that follows the original story in feeling and bewilderment, with only minor changes that comes with making a movie from a great novel. I urge everyone who sees this movie for the first time to read the book for many more interesting little details, all of which makes this story a very frightening one since it could become very real someday. Maybe by 2084?
B000065VA1|5.0|The last time I listened to So in it's entirety was on tape in my old '84 Buick around 1990 during my long college years.  Since my tape's demise in 1990 I have never re-purchased the cd or tape until now (13 years later).  Now I drive a car with a great sound system and drove around all day listening to So today.  The crispness of the low and high frequencies, the clarity of the sound, the tightness of the texture all make this remastering job exceptional.  As I stroll down memory lane listening to Peter's cerebral lyrics, I can't help but be distracted by the quality of the sound.  Even playing the album louder than I would normally, rendered me with goosebumps on my arms because it just sounded \\"So\\" good.  <br />The music is sampled in 128 bit/96 khz which sounds very good in my 12 speaker Harmon Kardon car setup, 5.1 home computer system and 5.1 home audio stereo system (Althought the album is not SACD the 128/96 sound is phenomenal).  I may have to by the SACD version as well as an SACD player (some day).<br />As for the album, it is a must if you like Peter's music presented in clean crisp sound.
B000003TA4|5.0|cutting strait to the point- you need this album. if you like loud, teen anthems- then you have &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;. if you like more alternitive rock, you have the surf-sounding &quot;Come As You Are&quot;. is you're into slower, deeper songs, then &quot;somthing In the Way&quot; is for you.
B00008PX8P|4.0|As someone who appreciates Zeppelin's music, but is not a HUGE fan, I felt that I had an understanding of who they were and what made them tick.  This footage did not show me anything new, it merely augments their studio albums in an exciting way.  <br />I still retain my belief that Jimmy Page was a musical genius, really a great guitarist, and that John Bonham was a very intelligent drummer who mixed James Brown-influenced groove into Zep's music.  I still see John Paul Jones as a decent bass player, and Robert Plant as a sometimes pretentious frontman (...) who was capable of the occasional resonant lyric (\\"The Rain Song\\" is one example of a good one) and occasionally interesting singing.  It was all there on the records, and it's all there on the screen.<br />One new thing that I learned was that Bonham really was some more of animal on the drums than I knew.  He plays his drum kit with his HANDS (no sticks) during part of his 1970 \\"Moby Dick\\" solo here, which must hurt like hell and especially if/when the hand hits the rim.  This guy was passionate about music to say the least.  Still, I think it was his intelligence and tastefulness that made him great, not his strokes which are for the most part easily duplicated.<br />I also learned that during most of the shooting and/or editing, the cameramen (presumably on direction from Page and/or the band) shoot Page almost fetishistically, constantly, while meanwhile almost never shooting Jones.  It's as if they were trying to make Jones invisible most of the time.<br />I also learned that they did a better job with these songs live than I would have guessed.  Page was able to recreate about 90% of his sound live, which surprised me given his brilliant use of overdubbing on their records.<br />The 1970 Albert Hall footage is pretty great.  \\"I'm Gonna Quit You Baby\\" is exceptional.  Already the band is retreating into the somewhat pretentious form later documented on \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" - Plant and Page doing extended segments full of moaning that they call \\"improvisation\\", and Page and Bonham each eating up large blocks of time with instrumental solos that clearly try to establish some link to Indian music and raga.  DESPITE that it's a good hard-charging concert segment.<br />The other footage on Disc 1, mostly from 1969, is good stuff though it's mostly the same songs over and over - 4 \\"Communication Breakdown\\"s and 4 \\"Dazed and Confused\\"s are present on Disc 1.  The 30-minute segment on Danish TV, with some kids sitting around the band in a circle, is pretty good stuff.<br />The 4 new & different numbers from the 1973 \\"Song Remains the Same\\" shows are quite good.   <br />The 1975 Earl's Court footage is a great segment.  The band plays \\"Going to California\\" and \\"That's the Way\\", and they really come across.  Led Zeppelin on their Joni Mitchell trip had some real power in what they were doing, even with just acoustic guitar, mandolin, and voice.  They go electric on an awesome \\"In My Time of Dying\\" which I think is the highlight of their catalogue and of this DVD collection.<br />The 1979 Knebworth footage is hard-charging.  By this point the band will have induced a migraine headache in you if you try to watch this all at once.<br />In the end, a good bargain packaged intelligently.  My only complaint is the fact that John Paul Jones in nearly invisible in so much of the footage.
0060934913|4.0|Bourdain's life journey behind the scenes in the restuarant business is a surreal ride for the general public out for the evening to enjoy a nice meal.  My goodness!  Bourdain is a guy that writes great guy books.  My husband loved it.  I was defintiely intrigued by the stories of sex and drugs in the kitchen, but wished it was fiction, so that my perception of the business would not be forever tainted.  I also found it interesting how the author described the business side of restaurants, the international nature of the workers in the business, how small the chef world really is and how chauvinistic the industry is.  Style-wise Bourdain is sassy, crass and not forgiving in this tale of his life as a chef.  I recommend this as a very good summer read.
B00008LDPU|4.0|I didn't watch this set of animated shorts with any expectations and therefore was not dissappointed.  I think too many reviewers are being overly critical of these short anime films.  How can they compare to the orginal after all.<br />That said, I was pleasantly suprised and enjoyed most of it only let down a bit by World Record, though even that one had much promise that ultimately went unfulfilled.  For the most part, the animation and stories were excellent.  My favorites were the awsome Final Flight of the Osiris, the two Second Renaissance segments with their allusions to today's world, Kid's Story for it's loose, exciting animation, and Beyond for it's interesting story premise and great direction.<br />I would say this is a solid addition to the Matrix universe, just don't expect there to me more to it than your rightfully should.  Also, watch the bonus material, it will give you a deeper appreciation of the shorts.
0807014265|5.0|I was given this book by a psych. that knew Dr. Frankl's son.  It was so 'heavy' that I read it over and over and over. Not ony were the quotes so deep that I still quote them to others in 'need' to this day. I keep my old book in my emergency kit - it's very important to me in times of crisis - including our annual wildfire evacuations.  Perhaps it's because I AM Jewish, but, I really understood, found depth in life and understanding. It also calmed my anxieties on death to a certain extent as well, something I have a hard time dealing with, mortality. What a brillant man, to not only survive a true living hell, but to rise above and become such a great person, author, doctor!! May heaven have that special place for him where he can now find all his loved ones.<br />amber, 41<BR>Colorado
B00008AY3L|4.0|Ben Harper has remained one of the unsung heroes of the music industry.  Many would consider him a one hit wonder after his minor hit \\"Steal My Kisses\\".  But music lovers know that Ben is a type of musician that is very rare in the music industry:  He doesn't compromise his style for commercial appeal.  This doesn't change with Diamonds on the Inside.<br />What may scare people away from this album is its diversity.  This isn't a very cohesive album, as he mixes reggae, hard rock, funk, and African tunes into one album.  It works sometimes, and other times it fails badly.  When She Believes falls into the \\"fails badly\\" category, almost to the point of being unlistenable.  Also, Harper is not afraid to throw his religious beliefs into his songs, so a song like \\"Picture of Jesus\\" may appeal to some but be hated by many.  <br />But enough with the bad, because this album is on par with each of Ben Harper's other albums.  \\"My Own Two Hands\\" is a fantastic reggae-type tune, as well as \\"Everything\\" and \\"She's Only Happy in the Sun\\".  I have no idea where all the bad reviews are coming from as I go through the reader reviews.  I expected to be disappointed with the CD, but as a big Harper fan I picked it up anyway.  I love it, and consider it to be another fantastic release from someone who never seems to disappoint.

0780021150|5.0|In this day and age, psychological drama is a dime a dozen.  I can think of several. Seven.  Silence of the Lamb.  To name two.  Yet way back when...even before I was a twinkle in my parents eyes...or a crash on their credit cards and wallets (lo those many years ago)...there was this little film, M.<br />M. is one of the greatest of dramas, of a psychotic killer that...as the story moves along...though he is unbelieveably evil in his killings of children...you and I as a audiance grows to have an interest in.  Peter's character in M. makes Hannibal look weak, because Peter is able to derive out of you so many emotions...anger, fear, sorrow, anquish.  Who is the real villain in this?  Yes Peter's character must pay for his crime, for in any logical and thought driven society such actions as he does call for punishment.  Yet the way the avengers in this film, the hunting crime bosses and their lackies...you hate them for the way they deal with Peter's character in the end.  You can't help it, you want to see Peter's character pay, but the way the criminal syndicate makes him pay for the crimes,  you will be left tormented as the credits roll.<br />I have to think that Lang was probably gaining some of the feelings and attitudes of this movie by the horrors of the growing Nazi party and their sinister evils that were only shadows in the background of Germany's rush for nationalism after the toils the country had to pay for in reperations toward the Allies after W.W. I.  I of course could be wrong, but that is my assessment anyway. Take it or leave it.<br />If you want a true scare, get this.  If you enjoy thought provoking movies, get this.  If you enjoy period movies, get this.  It is just that simple.

B00006WUWN|1.0|Considering I was only able to watch about 15 minutes of this movie before I had to consign it to oblivion, you might want to weight my review lightly (after all, the movie might have gotten better at the 16 minute mark).  But, essentially, this \\"movie\\" consists of a slew of Mike Myers spots (poor ones at that), interspersed with something to hang them together.  It's essentially the same thing that happens with the later Eddie Murphy movies:  we've got a star, let's show everyone how great he thinks he is.  Stick with the first two movies (the first one's excellent and the second on is good) and avoid this one like the plague.  I rate it at a terrible 1 star out of 5.
0688163173|4.0|This is not so much a review as a warning.  SHUTTER ISLAND is not a crime story or a mystery story.  It is a gothic horror story.  As such, it is designed to inculcate a different response in the reader than those other literary forms.  As a gothic horror story it is exceptionally well done.  Top of the line.  If you are expecting something else, however, you will be very disappointed by the ending, as several of the Amazon reviewers have been.  This is a departure for Lehane.  If you're up for gothic horror, go for it.  If you expect a traditional crime or mystery story, brace yourself for the possibility of significant disappointment.
B00008OWZC|4.0|Did anyone else wonder why the cranky reviewer listened to an album by a band that he thought was so overrated? Pay no attention to this hypocrite. This is a prime example of the juggernaut that was Led Zeppelin. Page IS a great guitarist. While he's never been a precision player, he's always been a adventerous one. This live set may have it's moments of wankery, but nonetheless shows this band at it's tightest. These version sound unlike their studio counterparts and that's the way they wanted it. If anything Zeppelin gets overlooked because of the popularity of their studio recordings. Get this set if you want to hear a band at the height of their powers. Let's hope that Page, Plant &amp; Jones will relent and release more live recordings.
B00008LDPU|4.0|If you love the Matrix, but felt that the Matrix 2 should have been called \\"Overloaded\\" rather than Re-loaded, then this is a redeeming piece of material.  This DVD is a fantastic plunge into the world of the Matrix, loaded with great stories and most of all wonderful variations of animation styles. It breaks the background history down in a refreshing way that leaves the viewer wanting more.  Almost every story is wonderfully done and gives you better sense of understanding for the entire world in which the Matrix spawns.  You don't even have to be a geek to apprecaite this DVD!...Buy it or rent it!...You'll be pleased for sure!
B00008OWZC|5.0|Like others, I never thought the &quot;Song Remains The Same&quot; soundtrack did Zep justice.  Thank you, Jimmy Page, for releasing this set of live smokers!  It's a heavyweight &quot;wall of sound&quot; from beginning to end.  Page is a monster on guitar here, with solos and reverb stuff that are epic.  John Bonham, the unsung hero of the band, is also incredible:  the HEAVIEST set of skins I've ever heard.  This is truly the way live Zeppelin should be played!
B00005NKKV|3.0|After the flop of their debut, &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3am&quot;, Simon &amp; Garfunkel went their seperate ways; Paul back to England and Art back to Columbia University. Once the Byrds broke with their cover of &quot;Mr. Tamborine Man&quot;, producer Tom Wilson had the idea to &quot;electrify&quot; the original version of &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; (much to S&amp;G's disdain) and release it as a single. The song broke huge and Simon &amp; Garfunkel were rushed back into the studio to record a followup album.<br />Although the album does indeed sound rushed, and does contain a couple of their worst songs ever (&quot;We've Got a Groovy Thing Goin'&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere They Can't Find Me&quot;, a bad electrified retread of &quot;Wednesday Morning, 3am&quot;), &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot; is quite the fine album.<br />Their fine vocals and amazing sense of harmony is still thrilling nearly 40 years on, but it's here that Paul Simon, both as songwriter and guitarist, begins to blossom. Even though there are the previously mentioned missteps, the album also contains some beautiful gems (Kathy's Song, April Come She Will), some moments of poetry (Richard Cory, A Most Pecular Man, Blessed) and an all out teenage agnst anthem in &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; (Why no one covered this during the grunge era is beyond me).<br />Although both would later cringe when discussing this album, &quot;The Sounds of Silence&quot;, although flawed, is early folk-rock at it's best and earliest form. Their talents would flourish even brighter in their sunsequent releases, but the seeds of that development are all here. Essential for S&amp;G fans and fans of 60's folk rock in general. Don't start here, but definately pick this up.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|I was not a fan of this album fo a few reasons. First of all, they are completely fake. They do not write their own music or lyrics, they have no stage presence when they are appearing live, and they have no style. A skimpy schoolgirl outfit does not count as style. What it is is sex appeal. Back to the fact that they have no presence on stage. When I say that, I mean that they do not interact with the crowd, and they absolutely no expression while singing. The only thing they do well is interacting sexually on stage with looks, caresses, and, yes, making-out. The second problem I have is that I do not believe them to be lesbians. I believe that it is one huge project to simply make money. I believe Lena and Yulia are very good at acing, and ay be very good friends, but not lovers. They also lack an amazing musical talent. No, they are not horrible, yet they are not geat either. Overall, I bow down to the executives who thought this idea through, yet give no credit to the singers themselves.
B00005NKKY|5.0|You know an album is good when one of the worst songs on it is the band's biggest single.<br />&quot;Bookends&quot; is Simon &amp; Garfunkel, and 60's folk-rock, at their absolute best. While other bands were exploring complicted concepts and rock operas, S&amp;G created a side-long song cycle about the simplest of ideas; growing up and growing old.<br />The album opens with a soft acoustic guitar line of the &quot;Bookends Theme&quot; which explodes into the psychedelic blast of &quot;Save the Life of My Child&quot;, then fades into the glorious land and soul-searching ode &quot;America&quot;. &quot;Overs&quot; deals with the subject of relationships reaching a stalemate, and &quot;Old Friends&quot; takes an elequent look at old age with beautiful vocals and melodies and stirring strings, and fades back into the original opening guitar line with ending coda &quot;preserve your memories, they're all that's left you.&quot; Brilliant. And that's just the first half.<br />The second half, merely a collection of songs, is one of their stongest collections. The moderate hit &quot;Fakin' It&quot;, the wry &quot;Punky's Delemma&quot;, the rocking &quot;A Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; and the poppy Orwellian-with-a-twist &quot;At the Zoo&quot;. The monster hit of &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; although brilliant in its own right, sounds almost out of place here, and ranks up as one of the weaker tracks. <br />The album covers a great deal of ground, musically and emotionally, and transports the listener...and does so in about a half an hour. Simon &amp; Garfunkel do in 30 minutes what most bands can't do with a full-length cd.<br />At long last, this gem of an album is getting the credit it so deserves. This is (arguably) Simon &amp; Garfunkel's greatest work as a duo, and perhaps one of the greatest albums of all time. Absoulutely essential.
0156027321|5.0|<br /><BR>Yann Martel has, as far as I'm concerned, written a fine story in Life of Pi. So much of it rings true: the way it is presented (an author stumbles on a story while in India), the details, the conversations, the factual zoological elements, the humanness of the characters.<br /><br />I was intrigued by the life of the teenaged Pi Patel in India and his fascination with religion.  While no particularly deep or new theological epiphanies came out of it for the reader, from the view of a boy of sixteen or less, it seemed quite normal.<br /><br />The family life was interesting, and all members were well-developed human beings so that there was nothing to detract from the reader's gullibility (or should we say,\\"acceptance?\\"):  this might be non-fiction--a REAL story of a REAL human-being.<br /><br />It is my belief that humans are naturally gullible creatures:  if someone races into a cafe and shouts, \\"There's been a terrible accident down the street!\\" everyone believes them with no other evidence than their word , and wants to know more.  Only incongruous details destroy our gullibility. And we test our gullibility regularly through our troubadors--our storytellers--laughing with relief only when we see through their deception.  We are mental creatures, and like other carnivores sharpening their claws and establishing their territorial claims on trees, we sharpen our skills by relating to stories.<br /><br />I was enthralled with the adventure on the high seas--all very believable.  Ships DO vanish.  I've been there, and the ocean is indeed vast and has many moods, all of which seem to be captured here.  The plight with the zoo animals aboard the lifeboat seemed to me to be perfectly plausible and well-described.  The animal reactions between Richard Parker and Pi Patel even seemed extremely plausible.  In short, Yann Martel had me in the palm of his hand.  The universe loves a story, and a storyteller is God's gift.<br /> <br />The implausiblility that finally led me to the inescapable conclusion that this was fiction, and not non-fiction posing as fiction, was the carnivorous floating island!  Such a phenomenon would certainly have been discovered--probably centuries ago-- and would by now be overrun by zoologists, anthropologists, botanists, and others.  It would be better known than the Seychelles.  But it was this very implausibility that demonstrated the author's imagination, and proved beyond doubt his rank as a troubador.  <br /><br />Without the island, the book might well have been accepted widely as non-fiction--simply an extraordinary tale recounted to the author as it was described in the beginning, which would have been a sad thing. A great talent would have been short-changed.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre<BR><BR>author of Handguns and Freedom--their care and maintenance<BR>and other books<br />
B00005NKKZ|5.0|The Beatles and Simon &amp; Garfunkel will always be tied to the 60's, being that both groups broke up in the opening year of the next decade. But whereas the Beatles went out with a bit of a whimper (&quot;Let It Be&quot;), S&amp;G went out with a big bang. &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; is arguably Simon &amp; Garfunkel's finest hour; a brilliantly written and performed collection of songs immacualtely produced.<br />Although there is no concept here, the album contain a bit of a tension as the personality conflicts seep into the songs (&quot;So Long Frank Lloyd Wright&quot; - a farewell to an architect, and Garfunkel once being an architect student - and &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; being thinly veiled goodbyes). Plus, Simon takes control with this album, Garfunkel many times seemingly an afterthought. Conflicts aside, the performances are equal parts grand and majestic, low-key and fun.<br />Songwise, a great deal of ground is covered here. &quot;The Boxer&quot; is stunning in its Spector-like production and moving in its lyrics, yet never loses sight of its simplicity with the trademark S&amp;G harmonies and acoustic guitar. Quite possibly the grandest song S&amp;G ever did as a group. But the big production numbers are balanced by simple and fun ditties like &quot;Cecilia&quot;, &quot;Baby Driver&quot; and &quot;Why Don't You Write Me&quot;. &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot; is Simon's adaptation of a old Spanish traditional song, pre-dating his world music experiments of &quot;Graceland&quot; &amp; especally &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot; by a decade and a half. A live take of the Everly Brothers' &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; shows just where Simon &amp; Garfunkel got their harmonies from. &quot;Keep the Customer Satisfied&quot; is a rocking little number with empassioned vocals and a goospimple-inducing horn coda at the end. And Simon offers up two of his most beautiful numbers ever with &quot;The Only Living Boy in New York&quot; (my personalfav by them) and the album closer &quot;Song for the Asking&quot;<br />But although Simon was in charge, Garfunkel gets his moments to shine, with a great vocal on the aforementioned (and ironc) &quot;So Long...&quot;. And he quite possibly deliveres the greatest vocal performance ever recorded in history with the astounding title track. A beautiful song in its own right, Garfunkel's stunning interpretation sends it through the stratosphere.<br />Whereas &quot;Bookends&quot; may be the better album as a whole, &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; is their strongest and most accessable collection, and solidifies Simon &amp; Garfunkel's legendary status. They went out at the absoulute top of their game. A must own album of epic proportions.
B00008PX8P|5.0|I've always felt fortunate to grow up in the era of high fidelity stereo, fm radio, and led zeppelin.  A few years ago I tried to convince my wife why I needed a new DTS receiver and six more speakers just so we could rent movies from blockbuster.  I told her how cool it was going to be to hear thunderclap behind the sofa or the sound of helicopters overhead.  But really, I was just hoping &quot;the wall&quot; and &quot;woodstock&quot; were going to be worth revisiting in the new era audio format.  <BR>  If blockbuster offers &quot;led zeppelin&quot; for rent, it will never be in stock.  Purchase this dvd set, it's worth it.  I still listen to my old vinyl lps sometimes and marvel at the value they have come to be.  There are few things worth what they cost anymore. There is outrageous entertainment value in this dvd.  Wait till you listen to &quot;kashmir&quot; AND get to see them perform.  <BR>  Thank you Mr. Page and band.  I just hope with the attention this product is going to get, that we &quot;headphone deaf&quot; music fans will get more of these kind of quality music dvds.
B00006RU5B|5.0|These days, the mainstream is overall quite lackluster.  Everyone's either trying to sound like Korn, Creed, or some horrible combination of the two.  Leave it to modern rock veteran Chris Cornell and the survivors of the now-defunct Rage Against the Machine to add some much-needed innovation to rock radio.<br />This, Audioslave's debut, is solid as a rock, and hardly loses a step throughout.  The singles, &quot;Cochise&quot;, &quot;Gasoline&quot;, and &quot;Like a Stone&quot; are all probably pretty well-known by now.  All of these are great songs, but everyone surely knows about them, so let's focus on the lesser-known tracks.  There are plenty of gems to be found here.  &quot;Set It Off&quot; and &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; are very heavy and groove-oriented tracks, &quot;Getaway Car&quot; and &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; are contrastingly more soft and laid-back, showcasing Cornell's killer melodic vocals perfectly.  &quot;Hypnotize&quot; has a slight techno vibe, and &quot;Shadow on the Sun&quot; is a slow, sludgy tune that recalls the vintage Soundgarden days.  There is plenty of diversity from track to track, with each song having its own unique feel.<br />The band could not be in more fine form.  Tom Morello especially shines.  I was never a huge fan of RATM (largely because of Zach De La Rocha's annoying rap vocals), but I've always enjoyed Morello's unique and unconventional approach to guitar playing.  He gets so many different sounds and atmospheres out of his guitar, that perfectly enhance the songs, rather than to serve as a disctraction, as they potentially could.  The rhythm section is airtight.  Not particularly complex (although the drummer does some pretty cool stuff in a few songs, like the aforementioned techno beat in &quot;Hypnotize&quot;), but impossibly solid and groovy.  This is overall a very groove-based album, and this can be accredited no doubt to these guys.<br />And then we have Chris Cornell. This guy can just flat out sing.  While this isn't quite his best performance (I don't think he'll ever outdo the incredible job he did on the Temple of the Dog album), he is still awesome.  Such soul and power in his voice, with excellent range.  Replacing De La Rocha with him is the smartest thing this band ever did.<br />So there you have it.  Amidst a plethora of boring and unoriginal bands, there is Audioslave, a band who keeps the true spirit of music alive.  You just can't go wrong with this CD.hile this isn't quite his best performance (I don't think he'll ever outdo the incredible job he did on the Temple of the Dog album), he is still awesome.

B000002TPS|5.0|In 1990 Megadeth's creativity had reached a zenith. It culminated on the album \\"Rust in Piece\\", which was a gift as well as a curse, because any work they made subsequently would be unfairly judged in comparision with it's predecessor. Such is the case with \\"Youthanasia\\". Released in 1994, I remember being more-than-satisfied upon it's arrival, but some fans bemoaned the album, saying it's not up to par with the afformentioned \\"Rust in Peace\\". Needless to say, these folks are hard to please. <br />The liner notes on \\"Youthanasia\\" are pretty thorough, with many thank-yous by the band and full lyrics. Some striking photos and painting's are also included. The boys had long-hair, even though the trend was going out of style. However for that reason the boys deserve credit, for sticking to their guns alone. The production on this album is spectacular. <br />The opening track rocks steadily with a good chord section towards the end. The drums thumping flow right into \\"Train of consequences\\". I remember the hit locomotive video. The lyrics are creative with Train metaphors abound. <br />\\"Addicted to chaos\\" churns in fine fashion. \\"Elysian fields\\" boasts a demonic backing voice during the verses and a melody-induced chorus. <br />\\"The killing Road\\" is fueled by a constant riff. The lyrics go \\"I lost my mind/I lost all my money/I lost my life to the Killing Road.\\" <br />\\"Blood of Heroes\\" encapsulates a haunting main-frame. The opening lick of \\"Family Tree\\" will uplift you, but that feeling will be short-lived as a murky bass line kicks in and the lyrics take on a sadder tone. This quick atmospheric shift deserves praise. Dave Mustaine's sings in a catchy way on \\"I thought I knew it all\\". Prior to preparing for my review I hadn't listened to this album in 3 years. There's a few songs that stuck with me in that span, and the latter is one of 'em. <br />\\"Black curtains\\" goes from a thumping intro to a head-nodding groove. The lyrics to \\"Victory\\" sum up the bands history in a nutshell, naming albums, songs, etc.<br />\\"Youthanasia\\" debuted in the Top 10 on the BillBoard album charts and proved that Heavy Metal could still be a viable entity in the wake of Grunge. It's a must-have album. Order your copy today.
B0000041DF|5.0|Martha Argerich's Rachmaninov piano concerto no 3 recording is certainly one of the fastest, and most exciting ones I have ever listened to.  Her speed and interaction between conductor and orchestra is quite formidable.  Her speed and power is built up, stage by stage, and then movement by movement, until the immense finale where her speed is white hot.  Her Tchaikovsky recording is also very spectacular.  The tempo at the very beginning was  to me liking.  True, there were wrong notes, but one ignores them.  Also, I managed to pick out a snap of a piano string in the &quot;Meno Mosso&quot; passage at the end of the third movement, which shows the sorts of things that can occur 'live'.
0688170528|5.0|I'm relatively new to Jodi Picoult's books, with The Pact being my 4th one of hers I've read, but I can say with confidence that I will be a fan for life.  I am always intrigued and captivated by her stories, her characters, and the fact that I sit on the edge of my seat turning pages feverishly is one activity I've come to associate with her books.  The Pact is no exception.<br />Teenagers Chris Harte and Emily Gold are many things to each other -- at first neighbors, then best friends, and eventually ended up falling in love.  Having grown up next door to each other for 17 years, it was only expected of them to be together -- a fact that pleases both sets of parents.  But a call comes in the middle of the night, the one call dreaded by every parent -- there's been an accident and Chris is in the hospital and Emily is dead.  Chris admits to the authorities that Emily's death is the cause of a suicide pact that was never completed -- he passed out before he could actually kill himself.  But with any unnatural death, there has to be an investigation, and the Medical Examiner's conclusions point to things that, instead of suicide, might spell MURDER.<br />This book was a very intense roller coaster for all involved.  The relationship between Chris and Emily's parents, once so strong and supporting, now lies crumbled and torn down with accusations and blame.  Emotions run high for each of the parents individually -- how could they not know that their children were suicidal?  And if it really is murder, what was the reason for it?  I found The Pact highly emotional and very riveting and it places the reader in the shoes of each parent, wondering in which side to empathize with the most.  I loved it and can't wait to read the rest of her novels that I have on my shelf.

B00005JLT5|5.0|I was half expecting this movie to be boring because I didn't think I would like this type of film. Instead, I would say it is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. I have never felt so much watching a movie. Adrien Brody and Roman Polanski were hands down the most deserving for the Oscar. I don't see how anyone could not love this film.
1563898586|5.0|Some weeks ago, I saw the trailer for the upcoming film, not knowing that it is based on a best-selling graphic novel by esteemed author Alan Moore. This is the second time that my curiosity was peaked by a film that got its beginnings from a &quot;comic book&quot; (the first being last year's &quot;The Road to Perdition&quot;).<br />I had to read it and am I glad that I did. As one that was grew up intrigued by the writings of Verne, Wells, and Stevenson and also watched the various film incarnations of Stoker's &quot;Dracula&quot;, this book was a must-read.<br />A thoroughly digestible feast for the literature fan, as well as a treat for the avid or even casual comic book reader, &quot;League&quot; just goes to prove that the modern superhero owes a major debt to the exploits put forth in the pages of works by the aforementioned authors.<br />The author and illustrator do seem to be influenced a bit by a certain Marvel Comics character, making Dr. Jekyll's transformation into Mr. Hyde a little too similar to the Bruce Banner/Hulk change. That withstanding, the story, with its many other literary references is a welcome addition to anyone's library.<br />Superman, Batman, Spiderman, AND the X-Men ain't got a thing on Allan Quatermain!<br />I'm placing my advance order for Volume II.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|I am a lover of great music, and this one tops my list. It has all the energy I like, the quality I have come to expect and a few twists thrown in for fun.<br />Ewan McGregor should consider a more complete career with time spent on the stage, doing what seems to come naturally. And Nicole, WOW! I love this one from start to finish. Anytime I need a little juice in my day, this is where I turn and then I turn it UP!
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I just love this cd.  I bought it as a way to introduce my 11 year old son to the beatles and as a trip down memory lane for myself.  And I got what I paid for!<br />I think this was a great compilation of hits.  It may not be the best *technically* or overall a true respresentation of the entire works of the beatles, but I don't think something called \\"1\\" is meant to be a compendium.  It's more, the cherry on the cake, than the cherry and the cake.<br />Perhaps, I dont get a sense of the  true growth in the group as a whole or as individuals.... but... it brings me back to the spark they had. The magic.  Each song stands alone for it's impact on music in general and the times they were recorded in.  What made them stand out on the charts...  the memories of AM radios and younger days.<br />My son, who couldnt be introduced to their music by endless listening to their more esoteric songs...  found his appreciation for the group from this cd.  And it has spring boarded into his interest to the groups other songs, as well as the members playing without the others.<br />Watching him learn to appreciate them paralells my own interest in the group.  He listened to the more popularly accepted songs in this CD and his interest has grown, as did mine.<br />I really enjoy playing this.  Its a bit of nostalgia, of simplier times...  and it IS some of the great music of the era.
0316666343|5.0|Alice Sebold is indeed a great author, not bad for a premiring author. This story did captivate my attention that I couldn't even put it down. You grow on all the characters, as if you knew them in real life, especially Susie Salmon who was tragically murdered at the age of 14. This book made me laugh, cry and really think. As I turned each page, the plot thickened and grew more intresting and on the inside you felt hopeful, wishful thinking that they would soon capture her murderer. But be prepared, b/c there's not always happy endings to every story. And that's what I loved most about this book, the reality that life can often deal you, how you often have to think both optimisticly yet pessimistically, and learning to cope in different ways. But I would most certainly RECOMMEND this book to anyone. In fact, I already have. =)
B00005NTN5|5.0|I've seen this film a couple of times over the years and I don't really remember much of the plot, when I first think of it. It's a very sexy film in a nice mystical way and that's what strikes me every time it screens on TV.<BR>There are so many films with quite a bit of sex in them, but this one really stands out, and no it doesn't stand out cause it's lesbian sex.<BR>It's really well-made and I as a hetero sexual feel very relaxed and comfortably excited watching it. Why wouldn't I? Well, because a lot of the time homosexuality in particular and female sexuality in general (sometimes the sexuality of the male as well of course), screens as something unnatural and ugly. Sex is always twisted all sorts of ways in film, which sometimes can just get too much. Which I think this film handles really well - it has got quite a bit of naivety, whether it be false or not, in Jennifer's part and that combined with the rest of the film creates a thrilling result that manages to stay away from the traps of becoming just another crap film. If you think about it, the mob story on it's own isn't much to hang in a tree, but the girls really make this a spicy one! :-) I enjoy to watch it every once in a while, possibly because I don't really remember the story after a while, it feels knew every time I watch it!
0060012218|4.0|Geography Club was a great and enjoyable read (I devoured it in a sitting) that I would recommend to everyone, especially people who need to become more accepting of homosexuality. It would be educational for many teens who have encountered only intolerance and might realize Russel isn't really any different from them. <br />Although I liked this book a lot, I felt that some elements of the story were a bit simplistic and certain things vaguely annoyed me. Why were his parents only passingly mentioned? And other things I can't quite put my finger on. All the characters seemed to be black and white, good and bad. Kimberly was evil. Most of the jocks were evil. Sometimes it felt a bit stereotypical.<br />But all in all, I think this was a good book.
B00003CWN3|5.0|They said on TV that this film was based on a true story and that immediately made me think that someone in this film will have to die. So I was prepared for that, but I was really quite surprised in terms of how the story developed. Usually when this type of film is made the main character would have left earth suddenly and too early. You feel really upset after seeing it and all the injustice made against this particular person and that hasn't been made right under their time here with us, living, breathing.<BR>This film however left me feeling comforted for his/her person and what he/she was given from his/her girlfriend. At the same time it rightfully disturbed my mind, in that way that you think such a thing should never have happened and how long will it take us humans before we learn to not interfere with other peoples right to themselves and being they way that suits them? Of course on terms where it doesn't hurt anybody else. Sure, you could argue that the perpetrator in this case was actually hurt, but no you don't get to go around hurting others because of your own hearts sorrow due to another not wanting the same as you...<br />As for the acting on Hilary's part - it's a piece of art! You would have to work real hard to make such a convincing portrait, she's brilliant.<br />Hilary and this unusual development of the story makes it well-worth seeing.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I have been listening to this cd for about a month now and to tell you the truth, it deserves 6 stars, it is quite amazing. <br />Tracks=<br />06-Easier To Run - Chorus is just amazing, you can almost feel it.5/5<br />07-Faint - First song I got addicted to. A really amazing track. Now everyone is going crazy for this song. This track really shows how brilliant and creative Linkin' Park can be.5/5<br />10-From The Inside - Great chorus, great back and forth vocals b/w Mike and Chester. This song is one of my personal favorites. 5/5 <BR>                     <br />13-Numb - Probably my favorite song on the album, well for now anyways; It's really hard to choose a favorite. Great chorus by Chester. 6/5<br />Other Notible Tracks=<br />03-Somewhere I Belong - Great track to kick this album off. Of course we all heard it by now.<br />11-Nobody's Listneing - A more Hip-Hop tune. Linkin' uses Japanese flute called a shakuhachi in most part of the song. Very different but great. <br />The other tracks are great to listen too and is also highly addictive to listen too as you listen more and more to the album.
B000002C1V|5.0|If you have never heard this album before, get ready for Pink Floyd's darkest, most emotional work to date. The album title alone, &quot;The Final Cut&quot;, has to do with suicide. In the title track Roger talks about being too afraid to make the final cut...&quot;the cut that would end his life&quot;. But this album has many meanings. People say it's like a sequel to &quot;The Wall&quot;, and they couldn't be more right. It just gives off the same vibe, but much more darker. The orchestral arrangements are beautiful and fit the music perfectly. They are what cause the album to shine. Take note that this album is not like any of Pink Floyd's other ones. 99% of the songs are slow and have strings accompanying Water's sad and gloomy voice. &quot;Not Now John&quot; is the fastest track on the album, but it is probably the worst track too. It just doesn't really fit with the rest of the songs. This is not the best introduction to the band, check out &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; or &quot;The Wall&quot; for that. The production is also another highlight of the album. The sound quality on the remastered version sounds extremely good, well actually it's just perfect. All in all a great album for any Pink Floyd fan, and if you're not a fan of typical Floyd...then you should check it out as well because you may like it.
6305428298|4.0|The most remarkable aspect of this movie is the great performance of all main actors: Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine,  each one of them as impressive as possible and it is hard to say whose act is the best; is it the surprising wonderfully voiced Jane Horrocks, who makes this movie such a satisfying entertainment, Michael Caine who plays all nuances of the greedy agent (one who knows how to psychologically manipulate mother and daughter) or the great Brenda Blethyn whose every twist of face and body is an act of its own. Mari talks all the time, but in the few instances when she has no words - Brenda Blethyn's face says it all. I am not sure that Mari deserves all that she gets in this movie, but she is punished for all her doings in the unforgettable words she hears from both agent and daughter. <BR>Throughout the movie I was expecting some sort of reconciliation between mother and daughter or some recognition from mother towards daughter, some kind words... appreciation...but none of this is here and there is no attempt to cover the real-life truth. This is even sharpened when one understands that yes, the mother is jealous of her daughter and no, the daughter is not just \\"naturally shy\\". All falls to place at the movie's climax moment and all is understood. <BR>Although Mari's character is unpleasant, she is so wonderfully portrayed by Brenda Blethyn that I was unable to feel any contempt for her character because above all she is a human being to whom you feel a mixture of both anger and pity. <BR>The second aspect of Little Voice is the music - Jane Horrocks honors the great singers (Shirley Bassey, Marilyn Monroe and Judy Garland) with her performance that tries to bring them as they were and not to glorify herself. This is quite a contradictory statement as the film was built around Jane Horrocks unique talent - but this is only \\"behind the scenes\\" knowledge and not what you feel when you see her on screen. Not a &quot;big&quot; movie and does not intend to be one. The splendid perfomrance makes it worth your time.
0385504209|3.0|Since it is written as a vehicle for supposed 'facts' I have to give this a 1... because the facts are distorted or outright fabricated. However, it was well written and highly enjoyable as a story... very fast paced. I'm looking forward to book three of the Robert Langdon stories.<br />That said, let me go over some of the weaknesses:<br />For starters, Jesus is not mentioned in the Dead Sea Scrolls. The scrolls are Jewish texts, not Christian. There are no accounts of the Gospel, standard or otherwise.<br />Next up. sex rites were NEVER performed in the Jewish Temple. There is absolutely nothing to suggest there were. This is one of the most absurd claims I have ever heard.<br />The author gives two reasons the Crusades were launched... two opposing reasons. Were they a product of AOMPS or the Vatican? Make up your mind!<br />The Knights Templar were not exterminated by the Vatican, but by King Philip le Bel of France. In some countries, they got off practically Scot Free (pun intended).<br />Most modern scholars who have actual degrees in European history discount the stories of Joseph of Arimathea and the Magdalen fleeing to France. Perpetuation of these stories is an outright deception.<br />Finally, the Council of Nicea did not \\"vote\\" on the divinty of Jesus... merely to include the statment in the Nicean Creed. The author seems not to know that an intact codex of Matthew from the secind century exists, and it is identical to our current copies... no alterations.<br />Please, read the book, but read it as fiction... ALL FICTION.
B00008YLV2|5.0|I owned the original release of this DVD and, thanks to this new release, I now own the deluxe version. Needless to say, this speaks volumes over how much I love this film.  I'm not a particularly big fan of war films but this movie really hit an emotional chord with me and I consider it one of my favorite films ever.  It is a truly powerful film.<br />However, this review isn't about the film itself.  Hundreds of people before me have already done that.  I am reviewing the DELUXE DVD version, which I must say was well worth the wait.  <br />If you are a fan of any of actors of this film, then the special features will be a major treat.  The main members of the cast (approx. 20 actors) - from Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Sam Shepard, Eric Bana and Jason Isaacs to up-and-comers Hugh Dancy, Matthew Marsden and Orlando Bloom get a major boost in this DVD.  The 2 1/2 hour \\"Essence of Combat\\" documentary alone is worth the price of the dvd.  It is packed with fabulous behind-the-scenes features, candid interviews and footage featuring the screenwriter (Ken Nolan), book author (Mark Bowden), director (Ridley Scott), special effects guys, composer (Hans Zimmer), military/technical consultants, cast members and even the actual soldiers who were involved in the mission.   There are approx. 9 deleted scenes, most of which were a shame to not have been included in the final film.  There are also photo galleries, loads of commentaries and many more!!!<br />If you are a fan of the film itself or want to know more about the events surrounding the Somalian conflict, there are two excellent TV documentaries from PBS and the History channel that would do just that.<br />I highly recommend this DELUXE DVD to fans of the film as well as fans of the actors involved.  It is a major treat to see your favorite actor go through the week long military training (orientation) at the Ranger/Delta/Pilot facilities, get their haircuts or just talk about their overall experience in the film.  Add to that an high quality transfer of this top-notch film and many other special features and you've got one of the best DVDs ever released.  Simply superb!
6304936362|4.0|Memphis Belle, Michael Caton-Jones' fictionalized 1990 account of a real-life World War II B-17's final mission, harkens back to wartime morale-boosting films.  Like Wake Island or Air Force, it depicts the crew of a Flying Fortress taking part in the bloody aerial campaign over Western Europe - and trying to survive the last of a 25-mission tour of duty.<br />Produced by Catherine Wyler, whose father William had shot a documentary about the real Memphis Belle, this version takes familiar clich&eacute;s from World War II films and fleshes them out with fresh Hollywood faces.  Matthew Modine, Eric Stoltz, Sean Astin (best known now as Samwise in the Lord of the Rings trilogy), Reed Diamond, and Harry Connick, Jr. are among the ten actors who portray the fictional crew of the Memphis Belle.<br />Released during the buildup to Operations Desert Shield/Desert Storm, this very retro movie failed to excite audiences, but even so, Memphis Belle is impressive once it gets off the ground and dispenses with expository material.<br />Set in England in May of 1943, the story starts somewhat slowly as an Army Air Force PR officer (John Lithgow) annoyingly prepares the crew and squadron for the Memphis Belle's return to the States.  The bomber has completed 24 missions over Nazi-occupied Europe.  Now the only thing standing between the war-weary flyboys and home is one last mission over Bremen.  There are the usual war movie get-to-know the crew scenes and even a quick (but not graphic) sexual encounter between one of the lads and a British lass...ho hum.<br />But when dawn comes and the bombers are sent to bomb a German fighter-aircraft factory, Memphis Belle draws the audience into the harrowing yet mesmerizing drama of a daylight bombing raid over Germany.  Here there are no Stealth fighters with laser-guided smart bombs flying with relative ease over the enemy.  Instead, we are treated to almost every danger faced by bomber crews in World War II - mid air collisions, flak, enemy fighters, and even a case of friendly fire.  Naturally, most of the havoc inflicted on the B-17s falls on the Memphis Belle, which in real life was not damaged as badly as this movie would have viewers believe.<br />The Warner Bros. DVD presents this film on both full and Widescreen formats on a double-sided single platter, making it necessary to handle with extreme care.

0446310786|5.0|I have heard this award bestowed upon The Great Gatsby, but for me, To Kill A Mockingbird is the great American novel.  In it, we meet the best and worst America has to offer.  We learn that while most Americans are good people \\"when you really see them\\", we unconsciously inflict the most damage upon those who never hurt us.<br />The central plot in Ms. Lee's tale involves the trial of Tom Robinson, but the book is half over by the time we reach this point.  Instead, Ms. Lee paints a picture of a sleepy, shabby Alabama town where locals are poor, have little to do, and spend a great deal of time worrying about the activities of their neighbors.  We see the town through the eyes of Scout and Jem Finch, children of the attorney Atticus Finch.  Slowly we see a world where people want to do the right thing, but lack the courage of their convictions.  We see how unjustly the town's African American citizens are treated by the majority of the townfolk, by the contrastingly decent and fair treatment of these citizens by Atticus.  We learn that Atticus is the man in the town who does what no one else has the heart to do--whether it is shooting a rabid dog or defending Tom Robinson in an unwinnable case.  He does it all without boasting, and without the expectation of reward.<br />I read recently that Atticus Finch had been voted the #1 hero in American cinematography by a majority of Americans voting.  I work as a lawyer, and a majority of my classmates ran off to join a big firm and get as rich as possible as soon as they graduated.  Yet we idealize this simple, humble man who believed in doing the right thing before making a fast buck.  In this time of Enron and secret terrorism tribunals--both of which make a mockery of our legal system--it is important to remember the lessons taught by Atticus Finch:  never cheat a man with less education, for anyone who does so is trash; never judge someone, for you don't know what it is like to walk in their shoes; never shoot a mockingbird, for all they ever do is make beautiful music for the rest of us.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is the reason Led Zeppelin was the biggest drawing concert act of all time.This compilation is a perfect snapshot of Zep in 1972. At the time, they were still kind of known as a live show band, even though they had several huge albums under their belts. They never released a single. The word was out on the street. Go see Zeppelin live. <BR> These L.A shows capture the band at it's best. Still hungry and excited about the new material(an unbelievable live arrangement of Over the Hills and Far Away), and yet not quite so bored with their live show standards(Whole Lotta Love). The accoustic set is a perfect blend with the rip your face off rock.<BR>  All this for probably [...] a ticket!!!!<BR>If you never saw them live, I suggest repeated listening of this CD. It does'nt get any better than this.
0385504209|4.0|The book is definitely fast paced, and I had a difficult time putting it down.  I enjoyed it, but was occasionally distracted by the fact that he'd refer to some tantalizing piece of information that won't be fully explained till chapters later.  In the mean time, he keeps telling you that's important.  I'm thinking specifically of what Sophie witnessed when she went to visit her grandfather.<br />Considering how much this book refers to certain pieces of art, I wish they'd been included in the book.  I mean, so many books have pictures/photos these days, why not this one, which just begs for it?  I found out this morning, however, that his website has them on there.  I suppose that's better than nothing, but what about the people who don't have computers at home?  I was motivated enough, however, to go to the library to hunt down some of the pictures after I finished the book.  I think if I'd had the pictures to refer to while I was reading it would have been even better.<br />But it's a good read regardless.  I think this book would be a good one to make into a movie.  The visual possibilities have me drooling....  Hey, Spielberg, you listening?  :-)
B00005IBGQ|2.0|I bought this cd after hearing &quot;hallelujah&quot; and &quot;across the universe.&quot;  It is nothing like these songs.  They do not emphasize his terrific voice and come off as extremely odd.  He needs to just stick to what he is good at.
B000002572|5.0|This was an amazing album when it first came out in 1976. Almost every song was radio material and they kept getting played around the clock, especially &quot;More than a Feeling&quot;. The fantastic melodies and the harmonistic singing just captured everyones imagination.<br />I think I read somewhere where Boston still holds the record for sales on a debuting album. Conventional wisdom said Tom Scholz and company had perfected these songs over a five year period. What a musical high it was. Unfortunately Boston never even came close to duplicating, let alone exceeding the excitement and feeling on this exceptional album<br />This album set a standard for pop-metal that may never be eclipsed. This is an essential album for any collection!
0553582445|4.0|I have read several of Robin Hobb's books when she wrote under the name of Megan Lindholm and liked them.  Not realizing they were the same, I never gave her previous trilogies much of a looking at.  At last, I decided to try &quot;Fool's Errand,&quot; since I thought it was the start of something new.  Now that is not the case, so I found myself midstream in a long series without an anchor, desperately piecing together the rest of the story.<br />Of course, it didn't quite work.  I found myself reading an obviously well written story without any sympathy for the main characters.  And fighting Hobb's tendency to drag out each action for everything it was worth.  This would be okay if I was expecting it, but &quot;Fool's Errand&quot; gets off to an extremely slow start as FitzChivalry Farseer is gradually pried out of an idyllic life in his forest cottage with his bonded wolf Nighteyes, and adopted son Hap, and re-enters the service of the Queen of the Six Duchies.<br />The young prince has disappeared, and FitzChivalry takes up the disguise of Tom Badgerlock, servant to his old friend, the Fool, to help find him.  The rest of the story is a tale whose background is the painful place of the 'witted,' those who can bond with animals, in the social structure of the Six Duchies.  Once the action picked up, I gained interest, but never the sympathy one needs to really become engrossed.  Finally, I put the book down partially read and gave it a break.<br />And picked it up much later to find things were much better.  Obviously, the book hadn't changed, so I had adapted to the rhythm and characters over time.  While I still think the story suffers from an extremely slow pace, I found myself appreciating the writing more.  One thing I have to concede is that Hobb's leaves few loose ends.  And the ending is extremely satisfactory.<br />This is a book for readers who like to immerse themselves in character and detail, but not for those who seek adventure with every turn of the road.  In that sense, it is a rare event worth looking into.  I do think it would be best to start with the previous trilogy though, which provides much of the explanation and detail for &quot;Fool's Errand.&quot;  If this is your cup of tea, you will not be disappointed.the road.

B000001OAA|5.0|I would give this album six stars if I could because this is a solid five stars not a rounded up five stars like a lot of albums are. Not only is their not a bad song on here there isn't even a weak song. From my experience this happens only about one in every hundred plus albums I buy or every five years, whichever comes first. <br />I love Shirley Manson's alto voice and her twangy, cynical delivery. The songs are well written and the musicians are very capable. The Music is sort of Pop/alternative/gothique. Heady stuff. And here's something else to look forward to, Version 2.0(the second album) is almost as good, as is the third release, Beautiful Garbage. Pick this up. It is an album that will entertain you for hours. Also Shiley Manson can be heard on Angelfish.<br />TRACK LIST <BR>1. Supervixen, GOOD SONG <BR>2. Queer, GOOD SONG <BR>3. Only Happy When It Rains, GREAT SONG <BR>4. As Heaven Is Wide, SUPER SONG <BR>5. Not My Idea, OK SONG <BR>6. A Stroke Of Luck, GOOD SONG <BR>7. Vow, EXCELLENT SONG <BR>8. Stupid Girl, SUPER SONG <BR>9. Dog New Tricks, GREAT SONG <BR>10. My Lover's Box, EXCELLENT SONG <BR>11. Fix Me Now, GREAT SONG <BR>12.

B000063DI9|5.0|This is an out and out masterpiece. A concept album telling a longer story of a child of destiny.<BR> <BR>Every song can get into your head, but are each different. And the single 'The Evil That Men Do' is one of those songs you just never get tired of blasting. From string synth ('Moonchild')to a straight out bass riff ('Clairvoyant'), every part of this album oozes with genius. The lyrics are awesome and sung by the best singer in the biz.<br />This is probably Maiden's best album, and that's saying a lot. Listen to know why they can draw a quarter million people.
B000000ORE|5.0|No doubt about it! This album broke the sophomore jinx and made a big name for these boys from Sacramento with five top forty hits including, \\"Heaven's Trail\\"(No Way Out), \\"Love Song\\", \\"The Way it is\\" and \\"Hang Tough\\".<br />If you're only going to have one album, this is the one you want! One of the band's best albums, The Great Radio Controversy retains the typical big-sounding production and clever hooks of '80s pop-metal, but Tesla adds a grittier, bluesier edge to their music than most of their peers.<br />Tesla was no hair band. Their music was blusey and folksey and more. It was basically Pop-metal sort of a cross between Guns and Roses and Tom Petty. Tesla also benefitted from the very unusual sound of vocalist Jeff Keith. His voice was gravely and high pitched and couldn't have fit the music better.<br />You've probably seen bands where the singer didn't quite fit the music. I always felt that way about Rush. Well, Tesla's music and Jeff Keith's voice were a perfect fit. It was sorta like Sammy Hagar.<br />BAND MEMBERS<br />Frank Hannon Jeff Keith Troy Luccketta Tommy Skeoch Brian Wheat<br />Tesla was great, I miss them. If there were still bands like them around, maybe I wouldn't be looking to Imports for my music as much, because I don't think much of whats out there today in american music.<br />Tesla was also the Musician's band. There the ones that the other bands, on top and wannabes listened to. I remember once reading in an interview with Van Halen when asked who they listened to, to a man said Tesla. Now who did I say sounded a little like Jeff Keith? Sammy Hagar that's who. Conspiracy theory anyone?
B00008973Q|2.0|The Great Lord, Hidetora Ichimonji (played well by Tatsuya Nadakai), has reached seventy years of age and decides to relinquish his crown.  He has decided to give equal power to his three sons to show that cooperative family life is important and possible.  His sons are worried that this won't work, until Hidetora shows them that one arrow could be easily broken, but three arrows held together couldn't.  One son however is not awed by the little demonstration and spoke up.  His name is Saburo and he is banished.  He leaves right away but is not forgotten.  Soon after Hidetora retires, the two remaining sons quarrel and fight with themselves and other enemies and get in a huge civil war.  Hidetora is eventually banished, but finds Saburo, who is kind enough to let Hidetora stay with him.  Eventually the war brings down the entire family.  Hidetora's other two sons are killed in battles, and Saburo is assassinated.  Hidetora then has a heart attack, or something like it, and dies on top of Saburo.  It's pretty depressing.<BR> Ran is very well done, but not particularly enjoyable.  Kurosawa, the world-renowned director, chose Japan, obviously, to shoot the film.  He shot the movie in rural areas where there aren't any buildings or modern roads.  The landscape is beautiful when it is peaceful, and ugly during battle.  During the peaceful discussions between Hidetora and his sons, the grass is green, the sky is blue and everything seems happy. During the battles, however, everything is gray, ugly and dead.  There is no grass, the skies are cloudy and there are many soldiers dressed in dull, grey uniforms.<BR> The battle scenes are amazing.  They are extremely long, which is very uncommon in today's films, like Braveheart and Gladiator, where the battles last for about five minutes.  The battles actually rage, instead of just start with huge explosions and then end.  There are hundreds of extras that seem to be trained as Samurais.  The special effects aren't great, because the film was made in 1985.  There is way too much blood that looks like red paint.  Even though the effects are poor, the battles are very well done.  They are easy to follow because the troops have colored flags that indicate which team they are on.  The battles are what make Ran the epic that is known as.<BR> Although Ran was very well done, I didn't personally like it.  All the shots were long and slow.  They lasted for a very long time, and since I have developed a self-diagnosed case of ADD from all the video games I play, I got bored of them.  The movie only had about an hour of plot, but it was stretched out into two hours and forty minutes.  I got very sick of the talking scenes.  The movie would be better if it was half as long.
0385504209|5.0|As an Art History student who took a class in Iconography with Horst Janson as an undergrad at NYU, I have to say this book is better by a mile!<br />Art and history brought to life and while it is a novel, it screamed TRUTH at me from every page.

B00005Q4CS|3.0|This movie hits you over the head-repeatedly.  After a while though, it gets fatiguing.  It takes more than technique to make a story!  The acting is great, the dialogue is less so, the method of getting you to feel like you are the addict is the best feature.  A thrill ride to hell.<br />The story is a non sequitur, it simply makes no sense for a large part of the film, particularly the ending.  The ending was almost expected, more or less.  Where is the story?  I like a good story, I do not think this flick had one.  Sort of like having an inside view of an addict's life, with some ridiculous improbabilities thrown in for shock effect.  Worth watching once, after that forget it.
0446608955|5.0|A walk to remember is certainly a book to remember!<BR>This is one of the most moving stories I've ever read.

It could have benefited from another 100 pages.<BR>I also watched the movie, \\"A Walk To Remember,\\" it is great in its own way. Some parts the book is better while some parts the movie version looks better.

0380789019|2.0|This is the first book by Neil Gaiman I've read and frankly it was little disappointing. The biggest problem with the whole book (and I am reading American Gods right now and it is kind a like that in there as well) is the complete and utter lack of curiosity on behalf of the main character. A great deal of very curious things happend to him but he never asks why... and in the rare instances when he asks a question (no matter how important) the reader is only alerted that at some point the question has been asked and answered... but the answer is not given. I don't know why this is and after reading the book there are so many things that are left unanswered that it is frustrating. <BR>Overall, I really didn't like the book, save for the writing style which is great. Right now, I am reading American Gods and it is a lot better (altough there is still the problem with the questions.) I guess Neil Gaiman just doesn't know a great deal of the worlds he creates so he just cannot give as enough info. I am sure that if I tell someone that they should not talk to someone they will imediatly ask me WHY. Not the case in this book. The main character will  just nod and that's it. Utterly annoying.
B00008LDPU|3.0|While it's claimed that The Animatrix is a collection of nine animated tales that happen in and around the Matrix, it's really a collection of eight, as there's a two-parter that utilizes the same animation studio. I'll say one thing for it: it's pretty.<br />Actually, there's a lot of good animation to watch for the 100 or so minutes that The Animatrix goes on. However, it shares the same problem that most anime (and, indeed, The Matrix Reloaded) have: style but lack of substance. Most of the pieces within The Animatrix are visually appealing, but they lack any sense of coherence. They're scenes of story that just miss the mark of being stories themselves. There are exceptions to this within the film, but The Animatrix seems to be more an exercise of marketing and visualization than an envelope push of storytelling. This isn't Serial Experiments Lain or Cowboy Bebop-no matter how much it wishes it was.<br />Final Flight of the Osiris - Created by Square Studios, the animation geniuses behind Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, Final Flight is a photo-realistic CGI fight sequence. It's wonderful and amazing to watch, as it takes the beautiful CGI of Final Fantasy and kicks it up a notch. It's visually fantastic. Unfortunately, the story itself is half fight scene and half flight scene with a weak and fatalistic plot. In many ways, this was the perfect choice to open The Animatrix with, because of it's aesthetic qualities. It also lets the viewer know what they're getting into: style over substance.<br />The Second Renaissance (Part I & Part II) - This two-part animation sequence is directed by Mahiro Maeda (the man behind Robot Carnival and Macross: Do You Remember Love). The animation style is a great representation of classic \\"Japanime\\" and it's a pleasure to watch. Rather than being an actual story, Renaissance is a compiled history of the rise of the machines and how it [the Matrix] all came to be. It's an interesting take on how the Matrix came to be where it is by the time of the movie(s). While interesting, it manages to come across as a bit contrived, as if the Wachowski brothers (who wrote the segments) had another series in mind when beginning, but were forced to shove that series' history into that of The Matrix. I'm not sure what the desired effect of Renaissance was, but by the end I sympathized more with the machines than humanity.<br />Kid's Story - This story ties in directly with The Matrix Reloaded and features, briefly, the vocal talents (or lack thereof) of Keanu Reeves. While I didn't care for the animation style, I was glad that it wasn't simply \\"more of the same.\\" It's the story about the Neo-worshiping boy from Reloaded. There seems to be an aspect of the story that is lacking, even with the knowledge gained from Reloaded about the character, there's still something missing within the story. It's a stylistic piece that lacked story and that missed the mark visually.<br />World Record - This is, quite possibly, the lowest point that The Animatrix falls. While I'm not a very big fan of the animation style used in, say, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, I don't necessarily hate it, either. Record uses a similar art style, but comes across as sloppier. The mish-mash story is about a runner who becomes aware of the Matrix because of his determination to succeed. Like The Second Renaissance, it doesn't interact well within the setting of the live-action movies.<br />Program - If you like animated fight scenes and don't care about story then this might be your favorite segment. This story is little more than a training simulation for a user. It's a drawn-out, feudal Japan-esche, fight scene that uses the context of the protagonist's lover (and sparring partner) trying to convince her to reinsert herself into the Matrix as it's (flimsy) plot backdrop. I found it to be the biggest yawn-fest in the film.<br />Detective Story - Shinichiro Watanabe, the man behind Cowboy Bebop, directs this pulp-detective, film-noir style tale about a man hired to find Trinity. It's interesting and aesthetically pleasing, but pushes the Through the Looking-Glass cliche a little too strongly and falls flat in the end. It's probably the biggest disappointment of the film, because it had the most potential. It's one of the few stories that would have worked and have been stronger with more time and outside the confines of trying to tie into another series.<br />Beyond - This is a simple story about what might happen in a \\"bad sector\\" of the Matrix's \\"hard drive.\\" While a little bland, Beyond is the one of the better pieces in the film because it works perfectly with the context of the live-action movies and the Matrix ideology itself. It's also one of the only complete stories. It poses a question and answers it.<br />Matriculate - The final segment in The Animatrix is a story about a piece of the resistance that is attempting to sway machines to their cause, one by one. It's more animated acid trip than story, but it's fun to watch. The end of Matriculate, much like the end of the first piece (Final Flight of the Osiris) is a fatalistic downer, though.<br />Ultimately, The Animatrix is worth a look, but I don't know if it's worth purchasing.

B00003CWTH|5.0|Warning: Spoiler below concerning the ending :-)<br />I will admit upfront that this film is not for everyone. By definition, art of great quality is not for everyone, as many people watch films purely to be \\"entertained.\\" Well, Magnolia will definitely entertain you, but it will also make you think and feel deeply. It is fiercely intelligent and unashamedly passionate. Therefore, most people seem to either love or hate the film, depending on the expectations that they bring to it. Magnolia is decidedly not an \\"easy\\" piece of work-- but it IS by far my favourite film of the 1990's. If you want predictable, formulaic filmmaking, head for the multiplex to catch the latest Hollywood blockbuster. If you want more, watch Magnolia.<br />Now, about the ending. The director, Paul Thomas Anderson, seems to have assumed that viewers of the film would have some knowledge of the most influentional and (once) well-known book in the world-- the Bible. Well, Paul, I love ya, man, but you assumed too optimistically-- most people, at least here in the good 'ol US of A, barely read books AT ALL anymore, much less a work of such profundity as the Bible. Oh well, we were a fairly well-educated country at ONE time anyway... Back to the ending. The frogs are a reference to the Book of Exodus, Chapter 8, Verse 2. If one looks very carefully at one point in the crowd at the game show, a man even holds up a sign with the Biblical citation on it. Think back to what the rapping kid said to the policeman-- \\"When the sunshine don't work, the good Lord bring the rain in.\\"<br />Congratulations, Paul Thomas Anderson, for not dumbing down your film. You force the audience to reach UP to understand your work instead of reaching down to them. Such an act takes courage in these increasingly mindless times. By the way, I didn't know the Exodus reference either, until someone pointed it out to me. Thank you, again, Paul, for enriching my sadly impoverished American mind. Are you SURE you're from this country? Just kidding-- I really DO love American culture at its best. This film is one great example. Please see it. (And read your Bible-- it has more to say than you may think...)
B00000255F|5.0|For a long time I knew little or nothing of the power of Bruce Springsteen.  He was one of those classic rock guys whose songs filled oldies radio stations hinting that his music was a staple of another generation.<br />With Springsteen's release of The Rising I immediately found myself wanting to look back over his career. I went out and listened to most of his older records just to see if they had the same spine-tingling affect on me that The Rising's haunting lyrics and precision played rock did.<br />Of those records Born To Run stood head-and-shoulders above other Springsteen records such as Darkness On The Edge Of Town, The River and Born In The USA, while those records all had their highlights, they didn't seem to be even trying for what Born To Run accomplishes.  From the opening harmonica on Thunder Road, to the rock opera of Junglelands there is an epic quality that resonates throughout Born To Run as Springsteen adds an emotional flare to the day-to-day struggles of the lower middle class.  His lyrics talk about wanting to build a new life and leaving your struggles behind, the type of subjects that few major label artists seem to be able to pull off from their multiple platinum view of the world.  On Born To Run, Springsteen sounds like a guy from your neighbourhood just plugging away at his music that allows the listener to completely accept the lyrical content of the album.<br />From a musical perspective what really impresses on Born To Run is the use of the piano.  The emotional piano introductions on Thunder Road and Jungleland are the albums most memorable parts, adding a down-to-earth quality to the music that other Springsteen records don't have. But despite the opportunity for the album to fall into a Counting Crows like abyss of sadness, one of the most surprising parts of Born To Run is how fun of an album it is. Tenth Avenue Freeze Out sounds like a James Brown song that Springsteen sings with such glee it's easy to enjoy the album's sudden RnB influence.  Meanwhile Born To Run's title track is a full on rock anthem that despite its lyrical content is actually brimming with attitude and energy.<br />Born To Run has that rare ability to grab a new listener immediately regardless of their age or even when they first hear the record. Even though it was released more than 20 years ago, Born To Run doesn't seem dated. Springsteen's lyrics have a timeless quality to them that mixed with the down to earth rock style of the record makes it well worth a listen even in the year 2003.  Maybe that's the reason why his music has remained a staple on classic rock radio for so long.nB influence.

B00005JA2B|5.0|The CD is just incredible.  I bought this the first time in 82, when I was about 15 years old.  what a turn on it was then, and now remastered, it sounds like heaven... songs like 'cheyenne anthem' and 'the wall' are just two of the many gems on this CD.  I can remember listening to 'magnum opus' and thinking there wasn't anything else worth listening to. I wore out at least two cassettes of this in my youth.<br />If you like progressive rock with southern rock sensabilities, this is the band for you, and this is their epic recording.<br />NOTE... if you are looking for some bands that remind you of Kansas, or are in the same musical style.. check out Glass Hammer, and Neil Morse --Kerry Livgren actually plays guitar on Neil Morse's new CD TESTIMONY.  Very good CD.  Also, Flower Kings and Spocks Beard.  But Glass Hammer reminds me most of a Kansas/Yes blend.  Symphonic Prog Rock.
B00008DDXC|5.0|With the first movie I was not please with how much it was unlike the book, this one is different, it's like following the book word by word, letter by letter, till it's not hard to enjoy!!!
0380973650|2.0|This book was certainly a page-turner, but it was nothing new and left me feeling dissatisfied.  The basic idea of competing gods with alternate &quot;realities&quot; like the &quot;backstage&quot; idea of this book comes straight from Heinlein's &quot;Job: A Comedy of Justice.&quot;  This book would be good for folks who have not read much science fiction, because then they wouldn't know that it wasn't recycled.  I'm very surprised that it won a Hugo.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I was given the record some 3 years ago and had put it away without even trying to listen to it. I just can't stand all those neat and overproduced fm-radio pop singers. Then a few weeks ago, I finally decided to give it a try, probably out of boredom. Well, good surprise. Big surprise. Excellent surprise!
0448060191|5.0|Before I read this book, I thought that magic and spells and imaginary books were the best. Then my mom told me I should read this book because I was going to love it. And she was totally right. The good thing about this book is that it is real. I have to admit it: I fell in love with the real characters. This book shows that life can be great with love. Louisa transmits feelings, and reading this book you feel happiness, sadness, and lots of stuff. My mom told me that she even cried when she read the book. The characters will become your imaginary friends and I'm sure that, after reading this book, you will see life in another way. In a few words: I love this book and I'm sure you will love it too.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Love this CD.  It's very romantic and very relaxing at the same time.  My favorite CD to listen to on my way home from a very stressful day at work.  I never really liked &quot;Cold Cold Heart&quot; until I heard Norah's version.
B00005ASHM|5.0|I've listened to this album hundreds of times and it still knocks me out. Brian Wilson is a truly great American. As Pete Townsend once said &quot;I love the guy so much I find it hard to take&quot;. I know how he feels.
B00006RCNW|5.0|This show is much better then I expected it to be. After watching Pilot episode I could not stop watching and I finished the whole season in a couple of days. Those who like &quot;Training Day&quot; and &quot;The Sopranos&quot; should watch this show. My friends also love it. Unfortunately, they don't show it on TV or cable here in Australia. I am definately going to buy the second season when it comes out. This show kept me on the edge of my seat.
B00005JLWN|4.0|I would have given this a 4.5 star rating, but I can't, and don't think it deserves a 5 star rating.<br />Nonetheless, the movie was great. The action scenes where extraordinary, and while some people say they are fake, they aren't. Here's how it works, the star is surrounded by enemies. He has two guns and shoots them in opposite directions(ie, one forward and one backwards, or one to the left and one to the right). Those guys are dead, then he does it the opposite way(ie if he shot forward and backwards then he shots left and right the next time), this is because those are the most likely of your enemies to shoot you next. Then it happens diagnally. Now this may seem a little fake, but you have to remember that this guy has been trained for a LONG time and is the BEST of his proffesion. He's also fast, not Matrix fast, but fast. Bale does the fight scenes with a kind of beauty, and it makes the action seem very real, very concrete.<br />And while I'm on the Matrix, I'll say, that this movie is original in its action, nothing like the Matrix. Don't worry, this movie isn't a rip-off of the Matrix.<br />While reminiscent of Farenhiet 451, this thriller is still very original. It has many twists and should be much more widly watched. I learned about the movie, not from T.V., not from the newspaper, or a magazine, but from another person who took a chance and rented it. I wasn't wild about renting the movie, but decided to as there was nothing else to rent at the local Blockbuster. I took a chance and loved it, you should too, wether you are looking at this review to rent, buy, borrow you shoud definetly get it, or at least rent it. It's worth every penny.<br />Christian Bale, does a splendid job too. In a world where there is no emotion he can't show happyness, sadness, anger, nothing. And he does it very well. He shows no emotion while doing the shoots up until the parts that require emotion(He accidentally doesn't take his emotion-depressing drugs on accident).
B0000028RR|5.0|This is truely the best cd by Rage Against the Machine.This has very angry and political lyrics.The guitars sound awesome and this is one of the best examples of hard rock filled with tons of rage.This is a master peice and it is a must have.Its even better than any other Rage Against the Machine cds.
0060090367|5.0|My brother was in intensive care in the hospital, and I had run out of reading material.  I grabbed this book from the hospital book store, mainly because the picture on the front looked cute, and I love stories that take place in Ireland.  During a rough time, this book kept me entertained and provided me with much needed comic relief.  The changes Claire undergoes after her husband left her prove that with enough time, you can get through anything!  A message that got through to me.  I am looking forward to getting some more books from Marian Keyes to read during the rest of our hospital stay!
B00008LDPU|4.0|Great new insight to the Matrix. The DVD is really short though.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is yet another wonderful CD from U2. They are so creative and deep and imaginative, and this CD boasts their out of this world talents. \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\" is such a beautiful song and it is very original. It has some kind of quiet grace that makes it a wonderful song for listening to when you feel sad. Or happy, whatever. \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" is also an awesome song. It makes me wonder what Bono is looking for. \\"With or Without You\\" and \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" are also really amazing songs. God, the list goes on forever, although my favorite song would have to be \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" because it is just one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, besides \\"Sombra De Ti\\" (Shakira, Donde Estan los Ladrones?). The way Bono sings it is just so unbelievably beautiful, and you can really capture the theme of the song. More amazing songs include \\"In God's Country\\", \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\", and \\"One Tree Hill\\". Honestly, I could listen to them all day. This is really a gem of a CD and whoever disagrees has something wrong with them. You can really tell U2's seious accomplishment on this CD. Buy it immediatley because it is so beautiful. Don't miss #6, \\"Red HIll Mining Town\\".
076790592X|5.0|Whether you are the sentimental type--which I'm not--or just the opposite, anyone with a heart will appreciate Albom's book about his relationship during the last days with his old sociology professor, Morrie Schwartz. Written in a short, easy to plow through style, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" tugs at the heart strings as we see Albom discover a new side of himself that he had ignored for the previous two decades. I like the honesty of the book as professor and old student dealt with the sensitive issue of death. I hope that I would/will be able to deal with death as Morrie did rather than deal with it by hiding under the covers, which is not the way we were meant to leave this life. <br />One thing I would have liked to have had more insight on was Morrie's religious beliefs. Besides showing his Jewishness and referring to God several times (for instance, Morrie felt God \\"overdid it\\" when it came to the story of Job), we never really know if Morrie was atheist, agnostic, orthodox Jew, or what. Maybe Morrie was not really open about his religious views, but I think his philosophy in this area would have been very interesting to many. Otherwise, this is a fine book that can easily be read in two short sittings. I highly recommend it as it will cause you to reflect on your own mortality and the things that make this life worthwhile (i.e. relationships with other people).
B00005NGZX|5.0|I have to let every one here know that because of converge i decided to form a band of my own! Im the vox  ofcource and we play sort of a  mix between  emo ,hardcore, and, thrash wich all together ? Sounds actullie &quot;impressed&quot; as our &quot;fanbase&quot; says and lets us know after every performance.Now, converge's &quot;Jane doe&quot; has realy  a truly good grindcore sound as well as emo put all in one. I realy haven't found one disapointed track here and the lirycs ? Good job ! Converge brings back so many memoris... thats why their music is so good to listing to! Laters!!
B00000IAU3|5.0|Like others have said, I first heard Dido, after seeing the Eminem music video for the song &quot;Stan&quot;. The chorus of &quot;Stan&quot; is from the beinging of Dido's track &quot;Thankyou&quot;. Around the same time I saw that video and fell in love with the chorus, I saw the music video for &quot;Thankyou&quot;. After that I was very impressed with her sound, and went out and bought her cd, just for that one track. <br />When I first got it, I only listened to &quot;Thank you&quot;, but after a little while I but it on track number 1, sat back with the booklet, and read the lryic's as the cd played. Suddenly, I realized I had fallin' in love with every track. And right after the cd ended I put it back on 1. Each song has it's own unique charm, and hidden beauty. Although, her voice has been compared to others, it is different, and beautiful because of it. &quot;Here with Me&quot; is probably the most popular and famous track on the album, but believe it or not, I didn't even know it was on here (or that she even had sang it) when I first got it. &quot;Thank you&quot; which has also become popular due to Eminem, and it's release as a single, is (of course) also featured on this album. It still remains a favorite of mine, (the beat before the lryics is soft and haunting, which helps makes it great), but it is now joined by others. &quot;Hunter&quot;, &quot;Don't Think of Me&quot;, and the bonus track &quot;Take My Hand&quot; join the two songs above, as my favorites. But all the tracks are simply amazing. I usually get frighten when the cd gets up to track 8 and up (track 8 being &quot;Slide&quot;), because from there on it tends to be filler tracks, however, that is not the case on this cd. Every song is terrific! The melodies, are always completely different from the songs before, yet every track seems to flow right into each other. And the soft elegance of each song shines throw everytime Dido starts to sing. The lryic's are some of the some beautiful lryic'sI've ever heard. They read like poems, but sound wonderful in song. And none of the song's lryic's have cheat rhymes, each word is very unique, and flows well with the rest, in a different way. Also, each track sounds very personal, Dido is not like other artist's who don't ever show any emotion as they sing, each word is expressed perfectly by Dido, and her incredible voice. If I were to rate each track, they would all get a 10/10. The music will relax you, and put you in a better mood. Even if you have only heard one of her song's, you should pick up this album. You won't be disappointed.
B00005JM03|5.0|Best movie I've seen in a while...great plot, amazing action, romance, comedy, and more...The Italian Job was great and I would see it again...and again...
B00005OAIE|5.0|A friend had me listen to this for the first time and I immediately bought it for myself.  I enjoyed the songs and the humor that is underlying in a few are quite interesting (but could be missed by some).  You won't be wasting your money to give this one a try. Good tunes and easy on the soul.  I will be looking forward to more from John Mayer.
B00005JLR2|1.0|This was one of Disney's worst movies. I collect all of the Disney movies, but this one will not be joining my collection. Even my kids hated it. It was actually painful to sit through this whole thing. I kept telling myself it has to get better, it's a Disney movie, but it never happened. The only good thing about this movie is the animation. I would suggest renting it first.
B000070IXT|1.0|Let's start with the merits: Marilyn Manson's contribute to the film is great, and Milla Jovovich rocks. Sadly, Resident Evil is a far cry from the Fifth Element and the Messenger... Hell, it's a far cry from Resident Evil. They managed to take everything that was great about the game series and ruin it. The Licker's CGI looked better in Resident Evil 2, the Night of the Living Dead had far better zombie make-up, and Michelle Rodriguez continues to be one of the most annoying (and worse) actresses in Hollywood. <br />It's sad to see Paul Anderson go from Mortal Kombat (the ONLY good game movie) and Event Horizon, to this junk. Really, the most dissapointing aspect of Resident Evil is that it ends right when it looks like it might get interesting... A city, a shotgun, and Nemesis... Alas, we must wait for a sequel to see how they screw that up though :(
B000002NJS|5.0|This is Madonna's best work ever, even after 5 years of listening to it.
B00005R23X|5.0|The movie Dracula has been made and remade since the epistolary novel by Bram Stoker was written. Bram Stoker's Dracula is the latest installment of Dracula movies. <br />     The movie starts with a prologue dating back to 1462. The mighty Byzantine Empire is at war with the Turks. Vlad, Prince of Transylvania stood at the forefront of the war as a formidable warrior fighting for the Byzantine Empire in the name of God. He was<BR>notorious for leaving his enemies impaled on spears in the wake of his army.  One day, Vlad leaves his loving wife, Princess Elizabetha, to fight a particularly crucial battle against the Turks. Vlad's army massacres them. But during the battle, a group of Turks fire a message-laden arrow into Vlad's castle. It carries the false message of Vlad's demise. Elizabetha dives of the cliff of the castle and leaves a note for her homecoming prince. Vlad arrives and sees Elizabetha's recovered body and damns God for his plight. After driving a sword through a large stone cross, he drinks the blood that bleeds from it. From then on, he is the immortal Dracula, the prince of the damned that feeds on mortal blood.<br />     Fast forward to 1897. A young rising real estate broker named Jonathan Harker is sent to Transylvania to arrange property sales for Count Dracula. Jonathan is kept as a prisoner in Dracula's castle and then the Vampiric fun begins.<br />     Dracula is a very lush movie. It's lush in color, good cinematography, better sets, spectacular costumes, deep symbolism and a wonderful score. The color scheme is done in the way that Sleepy Hollow was done. The settings are mainly dark, but have characters in clothes that contrast delightfully. The cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is exceptional. It gives wonderfully fitting angles to beautiful scenes. And the sets, o the sets. They're marvelous. They're so masterfully designed, you'll think that it was all shot on location. The costumes are absolutely amazing. The costume designer, Eiko Ishioka, won an Academy Award for his masterwork in the movie. They're so good, they're indescribable. They click not only with the Victorian setting, but also with the mood of each scene. The transitions are stunning and effective. They flow seamlessly into each scene.  The symbolism is immense. There is a great deal of recurrent themes and colors. It helps make the movie deeper than the average splatter house thriller. The score by Wojciech Kilar is fantastic. It's haunting and suspenseful. I would have it no other way for a movie like Dracula.<br />     The acting is quite spectacular with one exception: Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker. He's dead weight in the movie. His British accent is done in a quasi-effeminate voice and stays at one monotone level. There is no exaggeration when I say that there was next to no inflection in his voice. However, everybody else played their parts magnificently. Gary Oldman plays Dracula. A beautiful performance with the rights guttural noises and just the right accent. Wynona Rider portrays Mina, Harker's fiancé and Dracula's love interest. She plays the part flawlessly and gives the modest Mina the right expressions and inflections. Anthony Hopkins plays the sometimes eccentric occult know-it-all Dr. Van Hellsing. It's a sterling performance. Hellsing provides the occasional dry humor and he couldn't be better played by anyone except Hopkins. Sadie Frost plays the vivacious and bubbly heart-breaker, Lucy. Frost's voice is the embodiment of Lucy and her acting is quite exceptional. Music legend Tom Waits plays the amusingly insane Renfield. Even though the part is relatively small, Waits shines. No small triumph in this movie is the directing. The movie is directed by cinema master Francis Ford Coppola who orchestrated the classic The Godfather.  <br />     Overall the movie is a passing magnificent tribute to Bram Stoker's classic. Despite the baleful acting by Reeves, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a must-see. My rating is 5 out of5 stars.
B000050XEI|5.0|Este material cofirma una vez m&aacute;s la virtuosidad de esta hermosa mujer, Enya.<br />Temas como Tempus Vernum y Only Time son magn&iacute;ficos.<br />Este CD es verdaderamente recomendable para quien buscan un momento de espiritualidad &iacute;ntima consigo mismo.
B000096I9G|5.0|This is the ultimate Cure DVD! Their three most intense albums played live!  I haven't even finished watching all of it, but i have to stay that i'm pretty impressed with most of it already. All the albums are faithfully performed and each performance is pretty close to the full album length, so there aren't any experimentation (and fortunately, no edits). I don't know if it was the film or the filmer, but this is a much more satisfying release than the live performance from their Wish tour. That one just seemed too \\"produced\\" (if that makes any sense) and didn't really seem \\"live\\" (compared to, say, U2's Zoo TV video, which looks like a tv performance but feels like a live performance, with no overdubbing, etc.....)and basically, \\"bloated.\\" The band played really well, and i think i can finally appreciate Simon on Bass, seeing as how i can finally hear him (cheers to whoever mixed the sound). The final encore of the two Kiss Me tracks are also very well played, with the band \\"rocking out\\" on The Kiss. I probably would have also enjoyed \\"jupiter crash, faith, primary, push,\\" but i guess they needed some downbeat tracks to fit in with the rest of the set.  Also, there isn't any interaction between the band and the audience (which i suppose isn't really strange, but you'd think that during those three hours Robert would have something more to say than \\"thank you.\\" So if you're a Cure fan, you probably already have this, but if not, go get it. These live performances are probably the best they've released either on video or cd, especially the Disintegration set (entreat was just bad). Now we'll just wait for them to release \\"In Orange\\" in DVD.  Enjoy!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|This album is a welcome return to form after a four album losing streak. This album never comes across as sounding stale or dated. This album has everything a Maiden fan could ask for;  Galloping beats, a rythm section with a strong sense of melody, strong, structured solos, and vocals that never seem to age. I swear, along with Rob Halford and Ronnie James Dio, Bruce Dickenson never seems to lose his edge. The best songs on this album include &quot;The wicker man&quot;, &quot;Ghost of the navigator&quot;, &quot;Dream of mirrors&quot;, &quot;The nomad&quot;, and &quot;Out of the silent planet&quot;. Personally, &quot;The nomad&quot; is my favorite song on the album, which features a catchy chorus, and a great Middle eastern type atmosphere including wonderful soloing and a plethora of great riffs. This is a very varied disc and should make Maiden fans very, very happy. Keep it up guys!
B00005JL78|1.0|Ok, this move gets a little too futureistic with the pre-cogs and other things. It thouraly grossed me out.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Billy Wilder made some great ones and this might be his best. Jack Lemmon was terrific as usual, Fred MacMurray had the creep role down perfect, and Shirley MacLaine was just so damn beautiful in this.
B000002UA9|5.0|Brian Epstein recalled this is how he 1st saw the Beatles.  This is the one album that started it all for the Fab 4 in the UK.  It'd be another year before they broke through in the USA and Canada, though this was available in an abridged edition called Introducing the Beatles (it didn't sell well and is now a collector's item).<br />This debut album includes their 1st 2 singles.  \\"Love Me Do\\" is a skiffle (a style in England similar to folk, country and blues) number written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney back in 1957, with Paul on lead vocal and John on harmony and harmonica.  At the time of this recording (1962), Ringo Starr was a newcomer and though he didn't play drums on the single version or \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" he plays drums on both tracks here.  \\"PS\\" is a pleasant ballad with some interesting chord changes (also sung by Paul).  \\"Please Please Me\\" (recorded in late 1962 and released early 1963) started out as a slow Roy Orbison-style number, but producer George Martin suggested they speed up the tempo and John (who sings lead) included a catchy harmonica riff at the instrumental break.  The B-side \\"Ask Me Why\\" (also sung by John) has a jazz progression.  Who would've thought the same bloke who wrote \\"I love you 'cause you tell me things I want to know\\" would later pen \\"No one I think is in my tree\\"?<br />The rest of the album is basically a sample of the Beatles' liveset, all recorded on the same day back in 1963!  Imagine how long the session must've been!  The album kicks off with Paul counting \\"1-2-3-FOUR!\\" on the bright \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" (originally titled \\"17\\").  \\"Misery\\" follows this (sung by John, this is one of the 1st troubled relationship songs they penned).  Geroge Harrison sings the pleasant \\"...Want to Know a Secret\\" with a Spanish sounding introduction.  \\"There's a Place\\" is sung by John and Paul and features some fine harmonica blowing by John.  \\"Anna\\" (sung by John) sounds like it inspired \\"This Boy.\\"  Ringo debuts on lead vocals with the Shirelles' \\"Boys,\\" and George sings \\"Chains.\\"  Paul sings \\"Taste of Honey\\" (their version has more of an edge with the electric guitars).  Last but not least is  the Beatles' classic and spirited rendition of the Isley Brothers' \\"Twist and Shout.\\"  John had to suck on a few Zube coughdrops before singing lead on this since he knew his larynx would take a beating!  Paul gets into the act with his blood-curlding scream at the \\"aaahhhh-aaahhhh-aaahhhh\\" buildup!  This song usually ended the Beatles' live performances and was saved for last in the studio that day!
B0000048CP|5.0|Although all of Bathory's albums are outstanding (except for Octagon), I would have to say that this is Quorthon's signature album. It was a turning point in his career. This album is basically a transition from the raw, old school Black metal style found on his first three albums into more melodic song structures and themes involving Nordic mythology. \\"Blood, fire, death\\" starts off with the great introduction \\"Oden's ride over Nordland\\", which blends into the great war anthem \\"A fine day to die\\". Then comes \\"The golden walls of Heaven\\", which is my personal favorite of this album. \\"Pace 'til death\\" is a little dumb, but it's still alright. \\"Holocaust\\" is another fast paced, doom laden classic. \\"For all those who died\\" is a slow paced gem with some great lyrics concerning the atrocities that Christians have commited towards people who don't share their beliefs. \\"Dies Irae\\", for the most part, is so fast that it could be considered a wall of sound. About two and a half minutes into the song, the tempo slows down considerably into a very groove oriented riff which for me is the highlight of the song. This song also contains creative lyrics about Satanism. The album goes out with a bang with the awesome title track which is a perfect hint at things to come in the Viking metal stage of Quorthon's career. I really enjoy the lyrics which tell the listeners an uplifting tale of hope and rebellion. I  highly reccomend this album to anyone who wants to hear a cornerstone of the Black and Viking metal subgenres.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Page is beyond description, but contrary to the reviews in Guitar One Magazine, Page is not the whole band. Without Plant, and the others, it just wouldn't be the same. But Jimmy Page (and I am a guitarist- I'd like to think), must have practiced about 5 million hours, and then got completely creative to play like this. There usually is just not enough time to get that good without some (insanity?). Not only does he play clean, but he and the band get totally aberrated once in a while, for the contrast back to the resolve on the next clean number. Amazing. God bless that band. PLC  One last thing,  the only improvement that could have been, would have been the camera men, who filmed this years ago, were obviously not musicicans.  They kept cutting away from Page's left hand, not allowing the viewer to see what chords he was playing.  Too bad.  Newer videos, have great footage, and closeups of guitar fretboards.
B00008PX8P|5.0|...for sharing this incredible footage with the world!  There are countless Zeppelin fans out there (myself included) who were either too young or not born when Zeppelin was touring.  Before now, if we wanted to see what Zep were like on stage, we had 'The Song Remains the Same,' which is okay but not great, or, for the hard core dork set among us, grainy bootleg films shot on somebody's Super Eight camera or whatever they used back in the day.  But no longer!  Now we can watch this DVD, which is so great that the nonsmokers among us will feel the need to rush to the nearest Kwik Trip for a Bic lighter to raise in salute to our TV screens!<BR>If you haven't bought this DVD yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?  It's all good.  There are no lame parts to be had.  My favorite section is the Earl's Court stuff, but everything else is beyond amazing, too.  It's really cool to see how the band's stage act evolved from the Royal Albert Hall stuff (nice argyle sweater vest, Jimmy) to the stuff from later in the 70's when they were really working the stage.  For anyone who is not a Zep fan (what's wrong with you?) but will inevitably watch this anyway due to a loved one's devotion to the Hammer of the Gods, I'll bet you'll love this, too, even if you won't admit it.  Plus, this DVD is a bonanza of wacky 70's hair and clothes that will have everyone but the most humorless of fans giggling.  Come on, didn't you find it funny that John Paul Jones and John Bonham apparently didn't change their clothes from Madison Square Garden in 1973 to Earl's Court in 1975?  If you didn't, you have no sense of humor at all, but at least you had enough good taste to watch this DVD!
B000002IU9|5.0|Manowar is Powerful.  Their Best album ever made.  The kings of Metal sticks because they will change for nobody!  Manowar is and are the Metal Masters.  These guys know how to put out great material into their songs.  Manowar will always be my Metal king.  Best song on the album is Metal Warriors of course, but The Burning is 2nd place, as for 3rd Power of thy Sword.  Hail Manowar.  Death to false Metal!!!
B000003TA4|1.0|I don't see what others see in this album. The lyrics don't make any sense all all. The drumming isn't all that hot. The guitar work is ridiculously simple and so is the drumming. There is one positive outcome and one negative associated with the birth of Nirvana. The positive outcome is that with this album, Nirvana managed to end the popularity of glam rock which from day one blinded people as to what authentic metal sounded like. The negative outcome is that with this album, Nirvana popularized the entire genre of grunge which consists mostly of vocalists complaining about how awful their \\"Beautiful people having a lovely time\\" lifestyle is. Whiny, narcissistic, self-indulgent people don't impress me. I agree with the other one star reviewers. The death of Kurt Cobain only helped compound the praise of this band and especially this album.
B00003CXA4|5.0|I watched Sir Richard Attenborough's epic Gandhi as a child, and now that I own the DVD, I can say that I find this film as fascinating and awesome as I did back then.  Ben Kingsley turns in a wonderful performance as Gandhi, the attorney-turned-activist who fought for an independent India not with weapons, but with passive resistance and words.  From the Mahatma's early days as an attorney in South Africa all the way through to his assassination,  Sir Ben Kingsley portrays Gandhi with such searing intensity that I sometimes felt as if I was seeing the Mahatma himself and not the actor portraying him.<br />I also have to give a nod here to the wonderful cast of Indian actors who appeared in the film, but most notably to Roshan Seth, who played Pandit Nehru.  I have seen this versatile actor in several other films, but I think that he really shines as Nehru, Gandhi's friend and advisor.  This must have been an intensely personal project for someone such as Mr. Seth, who was about 5 when the Mahatma was assassinated, and he carries himself well in the role.<br />The extras on this DVD were quite a good mix; I especially found the newsreel footage of Gandhi to be quite interesting.  Although I was a bit troubled by the lack of a Hindi language track, I gave the DVD 5 stars because I figured it was an oversight on the studio's part that can be corrected in subsequent releases, and not something for which one can lay blame on Sir Richard Attenborough.<br />All in all, a great DVD that I will definitely find easy to recommend to friends and family.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Let me just say: this is the only cd I have bought this year.  For someone who loves music (and is short on cash) that means a lot. Everyone who's disliked this album really isn't accepting it for what it is, or trying to categorize it as something it's not.  They are the White Stripes, and they're at their best.
0553573403|5.0|The first 40 pages of this novel brings you even deeper into the lives of the various characters than even Tolkien could do in a hundred pages. Treachery, deciet, lies and incest lie at every turn...<br />George grasps you with his fluid story telling and tempts you \\"deeper down the rabbit hole\\". It is an epic that once you have started reading, you'll be compelled to continue.<br />I have read the all of David Eddings, Cecilia Dart Thornton, Garth Nix and several other fantasy novelists and by far George's books never cease continually amaze me with the darker side of human nature and how honor and valor can ultimately triumph over evil.
B00005LOLD|3.0|This review is mainly about this DVD presentation.  The movie is an outstanding 1950's Hollywood Classic Film dealing with bigotry, cuturial hatred & inter-racial marriages of the Post War Japan between U.S. military men & Japanese women.  This movie does \\"James A. Mitchners - Novel - Sayonara\\" a respectable transition to the big Screen.  The movie is worth the price of admission alone!!!!<br />Unfortunately - MGM did this WideScreen Technicolor 147 minute classic movie a disservice when transferring it to a digital format!!   First of all the true WideScreen is reduced to 4:3 Letterbox format.  (this is a inferior True letter box picture -horizontal black bars on 4:3 tvs & horizontal & vertical black bars on WideScreen 16:9 HDTV's (postage stanp size)).  Also by not being digitally enhanced for real WideScreen HDTV your Technicolor Pallet of vivid color is reduced to washed out presentation.  A real shame because the Japanese ornate costumes, lavish Landscapes & exotic botanical gardens colors are lost.  Also the only extra feature is a trailer.<br />Again, \\"Sayonara\\" is an outstanding 5 star movie with an allstar cast starring Marlon Brando, James Garner & Red Buttons.  At the very least rent this Hollywood Classic it is worth the viewing.  I hope MGM re-releases this film at a later date with all the extras to justify this films cinematic value & beauty.  Enjoy.
6305627371|4.0|WOW!  First of all, NOTHING can prepare you for how offensive this movie is.  Even though I'm a huge fan of the show, I was not prepared for how over the top this movie is.  Big Gay Al leading the USO show?  NAKED??  Saddam and Satan, gay lovers?  With Saddam pulling out a giant, uh, toy, from under the covers as if it were his \\"member\\"?  The all-black platoon being assigned to \\"Operation:  Human Shield\\"?  Terrance and Phillip's flatulence-filled song \\"Uncle F#$%er\\"?  And, of course, Cartman's rousing new (and international!) version of the classic \\"Kyle's Mom's a B@#$ch!\\"?  And that is just the tip of the iceberg . . . so, consider yourself warned.<br />Now, once you accept all of these images and sounds, the movie itself is a hysterical send up of overactive parental groups who are quick to blame the worlds problems on the artists (or in this case, the country which produced them) instead of taking responsibility for raising their own kids.  They make fun of everything and everyone along the way (including themselves, when Cartman is less than enthusiastic to see the Terrance and Phillip movie in the first place because \\"they're pretty funny, but the animation sucks!\\").<br />This movie really has everything:  sight gags, sound gags, toilet humor, a great statement about taking responsibility instead of placing blame, and most importantly, something to offend EVERYONE - Guaranteed!!
B000000Y2F|4.0|I was a little dissapointed with this one, it should have a label saying: historic 3 tracks, the other tracks are just fillers. The 3 tracks of Trane and Monk are amongst the best I have ever heard in jazz, electryfing. But theres also two outtakes from the Monks music album that you dont need if you already own that album and that do not show the chemistry between Trane and Monk. And then there is a track with Monk playing by himslef. I cannot help but feeling a litlle .... off, sorry.
B0000029AL|5.0|This is one of the greatest Starts in rock history! Along With The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Velvet Underground, Van Halen, and Guns N' Roses this is one of the greatest break-through albums in history.<br />-Make it, is an awsome song and the best song to ever start off an album! 4/5<br />-Somebody, is a really cool song with a rockin' riff its got a great blues swagger about it 3/5<br />-Dream On, this is the greatest song in the word enough said 5/5<br />-One Way Street, This is a classic Aero song about getting fed up with a chick. (Joe and Brad play a killer solo) 5/5<br />-Mama kin, one of my all time favorites and one of the greatest hard rock riffs ever, Mama Kin is the mother of everything good in life 5/5<br />-Write Me, is a cool song and Stevens voice sounds really cool along with the riff its a sure winner! 4/5<br />-Movin' Out, I love the song, the riff, the lyrics, the everything this is the first song Joe and Steven ever wrote and its one of a kind, really it is take a listen! 5/5<br />-Walkin' The Dog, a great Rufus Thomas cover that was also coverd by the Stones and I honsetly think Aerosmith did it the best 5/5<br />  So as you can see this album is just as important as Led Zep, The Doors, and yes even Guns N' Roses' first album!
0385504209|5.0|Da Vinci Code is the best book I have read in many, many years.  I hope that Dan Brown will write other books that involve Robert Langdon as I completely enjoy his character (as well as the history lessons!).  I highly recommend this book - 5+++ stars!
B00008LDPU|5.0|The real trick of the Animatrix collection is how it tries to stealthily introduce an American audience to some of the stunning animation work developed from Japan's anime tradition.  Or so it may have been envisioned when the project started.  The award-winning &quot;Spirited Away&quot; may have already gone a long way towards revealing to American audiences that Japanimation does not end with Pokemon.  Animatrix expounds on this, bringing more of an American storytelling element and presumably making the dazzling imagry more relevant to an American audience.<br />To be honest, though, I found some of the stories submitted by the anime directors to be the most intriguing and engaging.  Not that it all falls apart, either.  Each of the 8 stories feels very distinctive, both in story and look.  As such, the disc not only serves fans of &quot;The Matrix&quot; by exploring aspects of its world not covered in the films, but also explores the anime tradition with such wonderful variety.  They short films are anything but a series (with the exception of a two-part episode) and this gives them each a freshness that is great for the viewer.<br />I especially enjoyed the two works by the man behind &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot;, Shinchiro Watanabe.  &quot;Kid's Story&quot; is astoundingly imaginative in visual presentation.  The &quot;hand-drawn&quot; look bleeding to distortion is not only great to look at, but propels the story forward.  I kept thinking of &quot;Waking Life&quot; and how it played with reality as this film progressed.  His other work &quot;A Detective Story&quot; is very reminsant of &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; without feeling derivative.  Playing with color and tone really establishes the feel of the piece.  The design of the characters and props, too, creates an appealing retro-future nevertime very appropriate for a story from within the Matrix.  Very clever work, all around.<br />My favorite, though, is &quot;Beyond.&quot;  I simply cannot say enough about howstunningly artistic this film is.  In many way's, its story is the most simple and is really the only one to be told from a life within the Matrix without any intrusion of &quot;the real world&quot;.  It is wildly imaginative in story and presenation, and you must see it for yourself.  It is realistic and magical at the same time.<br />&quot;The Second Renaissance&quot; stories are interesting and really beg for a larger presentation.  I'd have loved to see the story told with twice the time, as I think it would lend greater impact to the savage violence we see in the second part of the story.  It is a fascinating mythology, and it does come across well here.  The animation is a bit self-consciously  inconspicuous if that makes any sense.  The story is definetly what is important here, but the visual seems to be trying to hard to not be noticed, as opposed to the seemlessness of the other episodes I mentioned.<br />The remaining episodes, however, are all about the visual and usually to their fault, I'm afraid.  It is hardly a horrible fault, but they do feel less cohesive.  &quot;Matriculated&quot; is the best of the remaining episodes.  From the creater of Aeon Flux (and believe me, you can tell), the visual is splashy and inventive and the play with color is supurb and important to the story.  My only complaint is that I don't think enough story was told.  Its a very intriguing concept, but a bit underdeveloped.<br />The same can be said for &quot;World Record.&quot;  A nice idea, but it seems a little hollow here.  The visual presentation, however, makes up for it.  It is very impressionistic and individualistic and impressive.  I can't say the same for &quot;Program&quot;, however, which is a shame because there is so little story here that it needed a powerful visual presentation to make the story.  Instead, it just drags and is my least favorite of the bunch.<br />Which leaves the much talked about &quot;Final Flight...&quot;  I'm not that impressed.  Oh, sure, it is a wonderful technical achievement but as with the Final Fantasy movie, the characters don't seem alive which is a major problem when your animation is banking on its realism.  Its a major step forward, and the action scenes are engaging, but this &quot;photo-realistic&quot; style just seems like bells and whistles to me.  All style and no substance.  Especially in contrast to the wonderful living characters created by Pixar.  The studio would do well to employ more quality animators who have really developed an eye for the way people move and live.  I've seen many, many traditional animation characters that exhibit more life.  They just aren't living up to the promise of the technology.  It felt like all of the effort was poured into the animation here, and it just didn't come together for me.<br />The extras are nice.  Nothing of any enormous significance, but a solid compliment to the disk.  I would certainly recommend this DVD to anyone with an interest in &quot;The Matrix&quot; or in anime.
B00000JNJ1|3.0|I really wanted to love this record. The good news; it is pretty definitive. Despite what others might say, this is the only Faces cd you need. The bad news; the overall quality of songs doesn't do anything to enhance the legacy of this band. The playing is always a highlight. Its easy to see why the Stones wanted Ron Wood. Its also easy to see why Stay With Me was their only hit. The rest is decent, never bad, but just not anything that elevates this band to the top. In retrospect, the impact of Rod Stewart saving his best songs for his solo records is more clear than ever. None of his songs here approach the quality of the best songs he wrote for his first 4 solo records. That fact is basically indisputable. Makes you wonder what could have been if there was a stronger committment level from Rod. There is no doubt Faces made some enjoyable music, but I can't help but think about what they could have been.
B00008DDXC|5.0|Okay, I'll admit, I wasn't too crazy over the first Harry Potter movie.  Sure, it was pretty nice when it first came out, but it isn't one of those movies that I'll watch over and over again.<br />Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets definitely is a movie I could watch over and over again.<br />The acting is brilliant.  It doesn't look fake; it looks very realistic, as if this were a real life scene and not a movie. The spell effects are awesome.  Not once does the movie get boring.  Each scene kept me staying on my seat to see what happened next when I first saw the movie.  Moaning Myrtle (sp?) was adorable.  I like her a lot.  The basilisk is definitely the coolest creature ever!  The giant spider Aragon (Sorry, can't spell for my life) is very neat too.  Actually, that whole scene in the forest is awesome.<br />All in all, I found this a great movie with plenty of action, a dash of mystery, great actors and actresses who make the movie seem real, and neat special effects that don't look phony.
B000002JOH|3.0|Pantera's second available album is a complete departure from the sound of their earlier power-metal recordings. The aggressive, rough vocals from Phil Anselmo; the high guitar notes played by Darrel Dimond (his name back when this album was released); the jazzy bass of Rex; and the fast-paced drumming from Vinnie Paul make up the sound of \\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\". <br />None of the views expressed in this paragraph are intended by me to sound negetive or positive. These are more or less mere observations about the sound of this disc. Here, Pantera has obviously taken influence from 1980's thrash metal bands (i.e. Metallica, Slayer, Megadeth). They come off sounding like a mixture of the guitar tecnicality of Megadeth and the speeding thrash of Metallica, with more basic song structures. Phil Anselmo's lyrics deal with government and religious hypocrisy, being yourself, etc. <BR> <BR>\\"Vulgar Display Of Power\\" kicks off perfectly with the first 5 tracks (excluding \\"This Love\\"). There is variety, headbanging guitar riffs, and insane vocals. Since these are the standout tracks of the entire 11 song album, I might as well give information on them. Starting with \\"Mouth For War\\", we are given a great catchy guitar-line that sounds like it would work for any metal-head house party. Although Phil Anselmo's vocals are too rough to make the lyrics catchy, the music is way too good to let that bother you. \\"A New Level\\" has a very simple song structure, but certainly stands out, with it's genius guitar-solos and heavy backdrop between Phil's verses. By the way, Darrel Dimond was at his peak for mind-blowing guitar-solos, and it helps even scattered moments of the weaker songs. Moving onto \\"Walk\\". It's repeated guitar-riff fails to be catchy for a good amount of time, but is good enough. The only other thing worth noting is the genius solo (which is controlled, but risky. You'll see what I mean when you hear it.) \\"Hostile\\" is a good song. It sounds like Metallica, but without any of the power. A lack of bass is apparent, and it just barely feel put together. But the speed should keep car racers and criminals of the such happy. Skipping past the horrible anti-love song \\"This Love\\" we come to the best song, \\"Rise\\". With it's blindingly fast main-riff and powerful vocals, it remains Pantera's best song.<br />Unfortunetely, the second half of the album is too weak. \\"No Good\\" is sickeningly basic and utterly boring to listen to. \\"Live In A Hole\\" is slow and dull. \\"Regular People (Conceit)\\" nearly rips off Metallica's \\"Disposable Heros\\" in the intro, and in the middle of the song, recalls the boredom of \\"No Good\\". \\"By Demons Be Driven\\" tries to sound intense, but the lack of ominous bass and goofy screaming of Phil, we are treated to a snore-fest. In the beginning, \\"Hollow\\" tries to sound melodic and 'haunting' but ends up sounding like an oldies hit from the 70's. Admittedly, the heavier part of it is refreshing, and a half-decent way to close the album.<br />Basically, this would be a perfect album if \\"This Love\\" and everything after \\"Rise\\" were edited. Then we'd have a classic EP. As it is though, \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\" suffers from severe inconsistancy.<br />Phil Anselmo's lyrics are arrogant. Whenever he speaks of the government, he sounds like a \\"anti-political redneck\\". All I have to say about this. <br />I wrote a review for this before, but since I wrote it, it sounds insincere. This is not a great album, it is average at best. Pantera's inability to be more than half-consistant hurts this album too much for me to recommend it. <br />It is difficult to enjoy Pantera if metal is not your only musical preference, so if you like Metallica and Megadeth, this is for you. If Fuel, Pearl Jam, or even something radically different compared to this like The Roots, this is not for you. It would be best for you to download the standouts above, and nothing else.<br />If you enjoy this album, you may also enjoy Metallica's \\"Kill Em' All\\",  and Helmet's \\"Meantime\\".  <br />Overall rating: 2.8 stars (technically rounded to 3, but not recommended)<br />P.S. This album is garbage compared to \\"Cowboys From Hell\\", which is highly recommended.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|This movie is very ambitious, but that isn't always a good thing, like a rival politician that has different views.  Every frame of film is lush and electrified, every sound edit larger then life.  A true musical, though I was not aware of this when my wife purchased it.  It shows elements of Cabaret and Rocky Horror and its very own taste of bizarre.  The plot is simple enough underneath it all as most musicals are, ala any later Elvis movie, but it proved to me to be a tough pill to swallow.  It is like watching &quot;The Wall&quot; by Pink Floyd but wanting something lighter.  It is a larger than life experience that you will love or hate, and that says something about it.  For me personally it was to convoluted and lost in its excess, but I could see that this could be someone's favorite movie that they would defend with very good reason.  It definitely is cinematic art, you just got to ask yourself what mood you are in before you watch it.
B00000APLB|3.0|I'm a Stones fan from WAY back, but drifted off into other preferences after having become a professional musician. I reignited my jones for them after seeing them on the last tour. I immediately started buying the CDs produced during my hiatus from them. I have always preferred live recordings and was blown away by both \\"Flashpoint\\" and \\"Stripped.\\" But after having listened to \\"Love You Live\\" on my way home from buying it, I wanted to immediately turn around and return it for being an dissapointing joke. I don't agree with those who say the Stones don't sound good live, in fact, for my money that's when they sound the best. No band can do what they do, or even come close to the kind of drive they bring to a performance. But \\"Love You Live\\" was obviously part of a strategy to get Ronnie Wood immediately on the royalty wagon. The sound is awful, Mick could easily have called in his performance and Keith sounds out of control. The guitar playing is loose and really the best thing in these sets. Charlie, as usual, is rock solid. Buy \\"Love You Live\\" only if you are a fanatic in need of a Stones fix.
0823003035|5.0|I have studied numerous drawing books and by far this book I have owned. I often reread and reference it to inspire me, and i can honestly say my work has improved immensely. <br />I had been a portait artist for about a year and the face is not a problem to me but the figure was a time-cosuming challenge, that is until I was opened to Anthony Ryder's technique of envelopes, blocking-in and contours. It made drawing the figure so much easier, well proportioned and realistic. Using cylinder and blocks just doesn't do it for me.<br />The rendering is awesome and it already has an impact on my art.<BR>This is not to say I simply copy his style but rather to combine his with mine to produce even more amazing results.<br />Lastly this is NOT your beginner basic learn-how-to-draw book. You should have sound drawing ability inorder to tackle this book. So don't complain if it doesn't instruct you step-by-step on drawing the hand or head 5 eye-widths apart(a pretty bad method anyhow). You'll learn to draw the figure as a whole and not as broken down indivual figure elements.
6304401132|5.0|Several people complain that this Disney film is not true to the original fairy tale. Who's actually read that, anyway? And do you think Disney could get away with things like adultery in an animated 1959 movie? NO!<br />Sleeping Beauty has been my favorite cartoon ever since I was three. There was just something there that I loved. The humor, the magic, and the characters. Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, the 3 good fairies, are very funny. Maleficent, the evil witch, is extremely captivating. I would seriously recommend this to any movie goer!
B00005JM03|4.0|'Italian Job' was a definite surprise for me - a lot better than I expected.  Ostensibly starrring Mark Wahlberg, Charlize Theron and Edward Norton, this movie is completely stolen by six co-stars, Mos Def, Jason Statham, (especially) Seth Green...and three Mini Coopers.<br />Mos Def shows good comedic skills as explosives guy 'Left Ear.'  Statham - of 'Lock, Stock...' and 'Snatch' fame - is suave and cool as wheelman 'Handsome Rob.'  But Green is the scene-stealer here. As Wahlberg's computer expert, Green's movie-long rant about *he* was the true inventor of Napster is a pop-culture thing of beauty.  [Nice little non-speaking cameo appearance by Shawn Fanning brings an added level of authenticity.]<br />Green also provides the comedic highlight of the film - providing some private, imagined dubbing on a conversation/pick-up between Handsome Rob and a cable technician named Becky.  It had the entire theater in hysterics.<br />In regards to the Mini Coopers, this might be the best product placement in recent memory.  The cars look fabulous here.  The marketing value to BMW is incalcuable.
B00004R99K|5.0|Several people claim that Disney's Alice In Wonderland has no plot. That's not true. The plot is like so: A little girl gets lost, and must find her way back home (in a dream). It is never confuisng, but weird things are supposed to happen--the whole movie is the dream of a 7 1/2 year old girl!! WEIRD STUFF IS GONNA HAPPEN!!<br />I love the songs in this movie! Golden Afternoon, sung by the flower bed, used to be my favorite Disney tune ever. Kathryn Beaumont has a splendid voice, perfect for Alice (and eventually<BR> Wendy in Peter Pan). The caterpillar may be slightly annoying, but he's still cool.<br />The mad hatter and march hare are very amusing. Their wild tea party is so random, that it forces Alice to claim, \\"This is the STUPIDEST tea party I've ever been to.\\" The Queen of Hearts and the Cheshire cat are also very funny. <br />And this is a note to all those fussing, worrying mothers who think the scene where the \\"cute\\" little oysters die is, and I quote, \\"inappropriate for children\\": GET A LIFE!! Do you want your kids to grow up thinking that every single thing in a movie has to end happily ever after?! If you force-feed your kids the typical disney happy film, do you think they'll ever learn anything?! GEEZ!<br />Bottom line: this is a MUST for all Disney and Lewis Carroll fans. And may I say, the movie is far more interesting than the books that its based upon (even though they were good).
0425152251|4.0|I have read through half the book, and I think it has its positive and negative points.  It is highly imaginative (although the fairy tale references may go a bit too far), and brings the central questions of philosophy in view with a certain degree of vivacity.  Of course, this occurs only through the first 150 pages.  After that, the book becomes quite bizarre, not least of which will describe Alberto's crawling growth as a mentor (is growth even really the word I'm looking for?!?!)  Yes, this book can be entrancing and gorgeous, but it will nonetheless require a LOT of sifting through.  I do appreciate Sophie's growth as a character, but it seems as though it is almost as halting as Alberto's character.  She could do far more to display her appreciation for him (by the obvious conveyance of Platonic friendship, perhaps).  Indeed, Alberto is a bit cold, but appears to slowly demonstrate a warming effect (although more artificial than not).  That is what irritates me so much about the book.  His character seems to be teetering between formal kindness for Sophie and a teasing urge to relate to her, if at all.  Sadly, the truth of his ways lies in the former more so than the latter!  Come on, why can't he reduce that stone-like objectivity towards her?  Is he afraid of tarnishing his stone- wall code of ethics or what!!  One starts to think that he and she are playing each other for the mere acquisition of information.  They're using each other as the means alone, rather than the end as well (remember Kant, people?)  Folks, Alberto needs to be more human towards her, and Sophie needs to stop acting like a split-brain patient when it comes to her opinion towards Alberto!!<BR>P.S. Perhaps the sequel will improve upon their relation towards each other- and if there is a sequel, it had better!!
B00008PX8P|4.0|Let's get it out of the way- this is an absolutely fantastic set and shouldn't be missed. The video quality is excellent, as is the sound, and it's an absolute bargain given the 5+ hour running time. Buy it now.<br />So why only four stars? Well, the production team couldn't just stop at a masterful restoration of the deteriorated masters- they had to 'improve' it. <br />Bootleg videos of the vast majority of this material has been floating around for years, and having seen much of it, I can vouch for the astounding restoration work this set represents. On the other hand, they saw fit to reedit nearly all the sequences to a 90's MTV aesthetic. Where the original may show a 10 second shot of Page's hands playing a solo, this version will feature 4 or 5 fast intercuts to footage of Plant clapping (culled from earlier in the set), digitally fuzzified and pseudo-shakycam versions of the original shot of Page's handwork, an audience shot culled from another show, another shot of Plant digitally slowed down in an attempt to make his clapping sync with the audio, etc., etc., ad infinitum. <br />In some instances it's apparent that this was done to cover minor glitches (probably unrestorable) in the video, but the vast majority of the embellishment is in sequences with excellent quality. The fuzzy faux-shakycam treatment is particularly galling, since it's such a cliche in recent MTV fare and obscures some truly lovely passages. I'm not expecting an historical document, so I have no problem with the usual monkeying with the set order or the merciful editing of Plant's traditional lengthy (and quite stoned) patter between songs, but every time one of these 'improved' segments kicks in I'm left longing for the beautiful set that would have remained had the producers stopped after the restoration process.<br />Sometimes less is more.
0790749815|5.0|\\"North by Northwest\\" is a perfect blend of humor and adventure. If the humor gets by you, it is still enjoyable as a chase film. Hitchcock lays the humor over this movie like a lace tablecloth. And Cary Grant, like no one else, plays the ludicrous situations to excellence. The shot that lingers on Cary Grant, standing on a dusty mid-western road, staring at the other man across the road, who is doing the same thing to him, had me doubled over laughing. It's one typical example of the not-so-obvious humor that might get by people. I say that because people have asked me why I think it's a comedy. Please get this film and watch pampered ad-exec. Roger (Grant) going from a theatre date with his mother to some of the absurdist situations in which one can find themselves.
B000002I2I|5.0|MORRISON HOTEL is the fifth of the six studio albums recorded by Jim Morrison and The Doors before Morrison's death. Three of the six are rated \\"essential\\" here, but MORRISON HOTEL isn't one of the three. The Rolling Stone Album Guide, on the other hand, gives MORRISON HOTEL five stars (its highest rating) and rates it the best Doors album.<br />Personally, I'm siding with Rolling Stone. The Doors was a band whose albums I would buy unheard as soon as they were released. They were one of the very best late-1960's bands. All of their releases were good except SOFT PARADE, which was a disappointment in my opinion. The first album (THE DOORS) and L.A. WOMAN were excellent, in fact. Still, I've always thought MORRISON HOTEL tops. It has a straight-ahead, no nonsense blues/rock flavor that make it more direct and accessible than the earlier sets. It's no accident that one side of the original vinyl release was subtitled \\"Hard Rock Cafe\\". Beyond that, though, the songs are all catchy and well-crafted, and Morrison's lyrics are some of his best. Overall, I find this album to be more consistent and cohesive than any of the others.<br />The Doors was a top band of the late 1960's, and that's saying a lot. MORRISON HOTEL is arguably their best recording. Many will differ on the latter point, but it is certainly one of their better sets. Any classic rock collection is incomplete without it. If you haven't heard it, wait no longer. Enough said.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|Watch out matrix fans, here comes a big one.  I think this movie touches a very interesting / futuristic / possible situation not very far from now.  The characters couldn't be better and the performing was excellent.  After watching matrix reloaded, this one still beat any odds.  Eventhough the matrix is a more deep-message movie, this one seems to touch an aspect never considered but psicologically interesting for crime bahavior studies.  Very recomended !!!
B00005JM03|1.0|Now I have to say that this film has yet to hit our shores but, in the UK, the original is such an iconic film, a film that defines the best of Brisish cinema, played most Christmas days, that the thought of a remake, let alone a foriegn remake, makes one's blood run cold. The original is perfection.....it's like trying to repaint the Mona lisa....
B00008J4P5|4.0|In response to &quot;Rodeo Jones&quot;'s harsh and narrow minded review (half a band? I wasn't aware all bands had to be a 4 piece?), you pretty much blew your review when you 'wrote them off' with Led Zeppelin. Both are excellent bands.<br />Everyone else, I just want to say: quit being a snob and check out the White Stripes.
0688163173|2.0|As I read this book, I kept checking to see if I had the wrong author.  I do think it would be a great movie but one I figured out half way through.  Maybe he is just tired but had to fulfill a book deal because this book does not stand up to the standards established in previous books.  I really missed his complex characterizations.  This book was like a good wax museum; pleasant to look at but not real.  Maybe Lehane wants to make a lot of money on a movie deal.  Can't say that I blame him.  Think Russell Crowe for the lead.
B00008LDPU|4.0|There is great quality and variety in this outstanding animation project. I believe the Animatrix as a whole would have been a lot better if there was perhaps five or six more episodes, with more connections to the movies storyline. Still, an excellent dvd if you're a Matrix (or anime) addict, like me.
B000096I9G|4.0|The Cure hold a special place for me, as they do for you, OR you would not be reading this or buying the DVD.<br />The good:  Sound quality, Video Quality, Performance.... the sets are very good, and the little extras such as the interviews are also quite good. I always enjoy Smith's candor in the interviews.  Some of the songs are amazing...Plainsong is just awesome.... 100 Years is Amazing....  and the entire Bloodflowers set is just like I remember in 2000.<br />The Bad:  Some of your and MY favorite songs are performed off key...yes I said it..off key... particularly &quot;Closedown.&quot;  This is my fav Cure song, and yet the keyboard sample is wrong....it is not even close to the original nor does it sound good.  To me that is tragic.....tragic .... I had waited so long to see it live only to be disappointed.  I can't imagine why Smith allowed this to go unedited.<br />6-string problems... the haunting sound of Rob's 6 string has been toned down and muffled throughout...why? I don't know...another strange decision by the band I suppose.  If you want to hear it best, get &quot;Show&quot;.<br />Bottom line is Buy it...you'll love it but don't expect perfection.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is a must have for Zeppelin fans.  The sound mix is amazingly well done with good instrument separation.  It sounds better than &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; and the performances are inspired. . .esp. the early Albert Hall footage.  Bonzo's drum solo at that gig is worth the price of the discs.  There is also a great acoustic segment on disc two that showcases their multi-instrumental talents.<br />Jimmy Page, well done.  The only question now is when are you going to redo &quot;Song Remains the Same&quot; with this new technology?
B00001OH7X|5.0|This album definitely merits more study by people who find it dull. There is no Bowie album which is more art-referential than \\"Lodger,\\" and a cursory listing of its musical attributes only tells half the story. I've often kept the cover art for the vinyl version on my wall since it was released. It's a unique work of art and never ceases to inspire me.<br />Unfortunately, many of the graphic elements that made the cover and inner sleeve such a perfect pop koan have not been reproduced in CD form, an omission which is sadly true for virtually all of his CD reissues. <br />The strange enigma of a cover is a reference to the dadaist Francis Picabia's \\"Portrait of Cezanne,\\" as well as to Bowie's gatefold image in \\"Aladdin Sane.\\" Like that album, \\"Lodger\\" takes us on a whirlwind tour of landscapes that may or may not exist, but in an inner terrain enabled by Jungian symbolism and dadaist vitriol. It adds up to a form of synthetic modernism that is absolutely unique among Bowie records. <br />To say that \\"Lodger\\" is weak on any level is really to underestimate Bowie's perspective on the future and his own past, to overlook the fact that before Talking Heads, Peter Gabriel, Malcolm McLaren or Paul Simon did their own take on the issue, Bowie was looking to the very foundations of rock to trace the evolution of modern Western consciousness. \\"Lodger\\" creates its own language of simulationism which remains unprecedented in pop music. This album is ABSOLUTE genius folks!<br />Since when is ennui NOT a proper subject for art? I seriously discount the idea that the song \\"Fantastic Voyage\\" refers to anything besides Bowie's depression. It's a worthy introduction to a treatise on cultural colonialism (revived in the video for \\"China Girl\\" as well as the visual theme for his \\"Serious Moonlight Tour.\\" \\"Lodger\\" also contains Bowie's first major use of angel symbolism, a theme he beat to death in later years.)<br />In short, in the Seventies, Bowie was more than a musical figure, hewas a cultural prophet, and \\"Lodger\\" finds him poised as a lonely scout for the human tribe. His art then was as much visual as it was musical, and in the entirety of this album are artfully conceived, enigmatic mysteries that have kept me fascinated for nearly 25 years.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This album is an instant classic!  How two people can make an album filled with so many different sounds, and recorded using no computers, still amazes me.  If you gave this album 4 stars, can I just ask you if you listened to &quot;Ball &amp; Biscuit&quot;, because that song alone is the best &quot;rock&quot; song in 30+ years.  Rolling Stone's 5 star review was more than warranted.  This, my friends, is rock and roll at it's finest.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|Maybe someday people will look at music as a form of art again,(the mainstream croud that is)rather than another way to be popular(and rich). Maybe then,(doesn't look like it will happen though, sadly)people will want to here genious work again, like it used to be decades ago. Somewhere along the music line, the youth turned to good looks. Now, good looks and dancing, rather than music that gives you goose bumps like 'A Day In The Life' by 'The Beatles'. Somewhere, poeple started caring more about what Lennon looked like, so to speak. Who cares what artists look like when your getting goose bumps from the intensely beautiful art that your hearing? The answer is clear....<BR>Great music that is called classic rock, has basically transformed into a different kind of sound. During that change, music took a turn for the worst, in my opinion. In the classic rock era, ALL music made, was ONLY about the music....Now, there is genious work, but not a lot that's for sure. Prime examples are: Radiohead, DJ Shadow, Aphex Twin...There's a couple handfulls of them, and that's all.<br />Now to comment on this album. This is the start of an artist that will definitely be known 100 years from now. This wonderful, very detailed piece is so beautiful......Words can't describe it. I don't even know why I attempt to explain his raw emotion in his work. It's just spectacular. All I have to say is listen to 'Heliosphan', that's the one track ( #7 ) that you should listen to if you are questioning Richard D. James' skill for making music as a child, or as an adult. It's interesting what a genious can do. <br />So if your on this page, reading this, most likely you care about good music like me, and don't care about what he looks like (which is why he has his face on just about every cover, smiling that way)........I have a little something to say to people who are so sadly missing out on such a perfect art called music: People that want to \\"watch\\" music, I'm asking you please, for your sake......\\"Listen\\" to it.....Peace.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Release Seinfeld, its a guarenteed Multi-Million dollar decision.  If all the episodes are released, there will be more people buying them then every series combined.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I own thanks to it's blended mix of everything from soft piano tracks(My Immortal), to the hardest rock              <BR>you can get(Bring me to Life). It even has a song that would creep you out if you were alone(Haunted). I reccomend this CD to anyone who has the money to spend and a good reason.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This is one of the few films I would watch again and again. Like Shakespeare in Love, I could start the DVD at any point and be entranced.<BR>The structure of the play is pure Aescheus(sp?); one actor's voice, (even Mozart is chorus), one enormous hubris (blocking God), and a simple twist to foil Salieri - Mozart's wife comes home.<BR>Understand, this is a story, not history.
B000069CWE|4.0|I think these are the best remixes I have heard in a long time. They have newer better elements that I wouldn't have even thought would work. I would buy this CD with or without being a Linkin Park fan.
B0000024T3|5.0|This album devoted to songs penned by French composers marks Streisand's first collaboration with producer/composer Michael Legrand, whom would go on to write the brilliant score for Yentl in 1983.  It provides the singer with a bit of challenge, seeing that it calls upon her to sing not only in English but also French for the first time as well.  Not surprisingly, she pulls off the numbers splendidly and JE M'APPELLE BARBRA is yet another exceptional release from Streisand's sixties catalogue.  Barbra gives definitive renditions of the French classics \\"Autumn Leaves,\\" \\"Clopin Clopant,\\" \\"Speak To Me Of Love,\\" and the breathtaking \\"Once Upon A Summertime.\\"  The lessor-known material (\\"What Now My Love,\\" \\"I Wish You Love\\") is just as good, with \\"Free Again\\" (which had been performed in French as \\"Non C'est Rien\\" on Color Me Barbra) standing strong as one of her most amazing vocal performances.  The disc also finds Barbra composing her first melody (\\"Ma Premiere Chanson,\\" which showcases her considerable writing talent in it's early stages), as well as tackling a song that was originally written for Edith Piaf (\\"Le Mer\\"), on which Streisand really excels.  A delightful departure for the singer, JE M'APPELLE BARBRA Barbra became Streisand's 8 straight Top Five album on the Billboard Hot 200 and eventually went Gold several years later.
B000005RT8|5.0|I can't believe more people can't see the genius in this album, Macca plays all the insterments and does it so well, I guess he was right when he said NOBODY KNOWS! they don't acording to the reveiws, well probably because of how ahead of it's time it was, DARK ROOM, should be out now and still I havn't seen anyone get more real then that, and CHECK MY MACHINE, macca is hip hop no question, I've had so many people say that this is there favorite macca album, I'm talking about kids in there early 20's in the year 2003, paul has perefct execution in this, I've seen people cry to ONE OF THESE DAYS, and FRONT PARLOR, what forget about it, FROZEN JAP is techno from the 90's, anyone who doesn't like the fireman is not a music fan or is just too old, see MACCA is for the young generations and he keeps hittin them, that's why they say that he always got the teeny's and that's true. Back to the egg was also way ahead of it's time, this era of macca is unbelievable, if you don't get this then you're missing out. THE ONLY SONG I SKIP OVER is WATERFALLS, this seems to be the favorite on this album, well I always skip it because I find it the only corny track on it figures it went pop, COMING UP is cool but runs as second worst compared to how hot this album is, so the most popular songs are the weekest, go figure, and yes folks BOGEY MUSIC and ON THE WAY rule!!
B00008OWZC|4.0|Fans of Led Zeppelin for years have been asking for live material to be released from the vaults. Other than bootlegs, the only previous live material released was the soundtrack from \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" movie which was somewhat disappointing and the \\"BBC Sessions\\" which contains mostly earlier material.  \\"How The West Was Won\\" is a 3 cd set that contains material from concerts at Los Angeles and Long Beach in 1972.  The masterial included is from their first 5 albums.  The disks sound ok considering the tapes are over 30 years old but are somewhat muddy in places.  John Paul Jones bass could have been mixed a little more prominently.  Jones versatility proves a drawback in the live setting as he can not play the bass and keyboards at the same time.  The dual role is alleviated in the studio by the use of overdubbing.  Interestingly the songs that sound the clearest are the three song acoustic set at the end of disk one.  \\"Going To California\\" (ironic?) and \\"That's The Way\\" never sounded better.  Other highlights include moving versions of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\".  I was glad lesser known favorites like \\"Over The Hills And Far Away\\", \\"Bring It On Home\\" and \\"The Ocean\\" were included.  The rock and roll/blues medley in \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" is an interesting look at the band's influences.  <br />There are a few drawbacks.  It sounds as if Jimmy Page is having tuning problems during \\"Black Dog\\" and with the exception of \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\" disk two is a disappointment.  \\"Dazed And Confused\\" spends a lot of time going nowhere. The interpolation of \\"Walter's Walk\\" was the most interesting part.  These guys weren't as adept at jamming as Cream, the Allman Brothers Band, the Grateful Dead, King Crimson or Quicksilver Messenger Service\\".  While in no way a knock on Jimmy Page he tends to play his solos note for note like they are on the album with little room for improvisations. Some people may like this but I favor a littlemore improvisation to keep the songs sounding fresh otherwise you might as well listen to the album version at home.  John Bonham while one the great rock drummers as evidenced on this set does not hold my interest for 20 minutes of \\"Moby Dick\\".  While most bands from this era features long drum solos this loses my interest after about five minutes.  In addition each disk is less than an hour.  It would be great to hear more inspired versions of \\"Celebration Day\\", \\"No Quarter\\" and \\"Rain Song\\" than the ones included on the \\"Song Remains The Same\\" soundtrack.  I had hoped they would include more later period material from the post \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" albums like on the DVD.  Maybe they will release another live set with material from this later period.  All in all, a worthy purchase for fans and a better representation of their live sound but by no means perfect.
B00005JLRT|5.0|Star Trek: Nemesis, the Tenth and perhaps last of the Star Trek theatrical films, directed by Stuart Baird, focuses on the idea of what makes up ones own personality through the course of events and actions that effect our life?  If altered, can they be changed or are we bound by some unknown destiny we cannot foresee?  Patrick Stewart returns as Captain Jean-Luc Picard along with the rest of the original \\"Next Generation\\" cast.  His adversary: a twenty-four year old clone of himself named Shinzon (Tom Hardy), who was created by the Romulan empire in the hopes of killing Picard and taking his place.  But the plan was scrapped and Shinzon was forced to live out most of his life on the dark, desolate, dillithium mining planet of Remus, where he slowly began plotting his revenge: the total annihilation of earth.<br />     Strong performances abound in this truly grand epic, including Tom Hardy as Shinzon, who does a spectacular job going nose to nose against Patrick Stewart's legendary acting abilities, while still managing to hold his own in a scene together.  The film also boasts an impressive story, including a unique subplot about Data (Brent Spiner) and his newfound brother, B-4 (also played by Spiner).  Other highlights include the much anticipated wedding between Will Riker and Deanna Troi as well as Data's rendition of Irving Berlin's \\"Blue Skies\\" at the party afterwards.  And with strong character development, a tremendous score by Jerry Goldsmith (one of his best), some exciting action sequences, including an all terrain vehicle chase (with Picard behind the wheel) and an all out space battle between the Enterprise and the Scimitar (Shinzon's cloaked vessel), you've got yourself a film that's has it all.<br />     So then what happened at the box office?  Many people are still scratching their heads as to why Star Trek: Nemesis ended up becoming the lowest money making Trek film of the entire franchise, which was previously held by Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.  A major factor had to be the release date on December 13th (2002), which pigeonholed the film in-between the release dates of Harry Potter & The Chamber of Secrets as well as The Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers, two of the most highly anticipated movies of the year.  It would almost seem like suicide to release a film anywhere near either of them.  Still others contend that the downfall occurred due to the franchise exhausting itself with all the different television series that have been released over the years, burning itself out in the process.  Some have even argued that there were just too many parallels between Nemesis and Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn.  But no matter if you're an optimist or a pessimist, the question remains:  <br />     <BR>     Can something be done to help save the franchise?<br />     A popular idea (which this reviewer happens to agree with) is to bring back the ever popular character, \\"Q\\" (made famous on the tv series) and make a film using him as the main focal point.  Played flawlessly by actor John de Lancie, \\"Q\\", an omnipotent superbeing, would be able to take the Enterprise on a journey the likes of which we, the filmgoing public, have never seen or imagined.  He also has the potential to appeal to both Trek and non-Trek fans alike.  \\"Q\\" is always at his best when matching wits against Picard.  Their chemistry together is just perfect.  With all his amazing powers (the ability to make anyone or anything appear as well as taking anyone anywhere in the universe), the possibilities are endless as to the kind of story that could be made for a possible Star Trek XI.  And although this doesn't seem likely now, one can remember a similar experience with Star Trek V: The Final Frontier when everyone thought it would also be the last installment.  Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker) has been saying for virtually every TNG picture, that \\"Q\\" will eventually show up in one of them.  \\"Q\\" could do for Star Trek XI what the Borg did for \\"First Contact.  But is it too late?  Let's hope not.<br />     The Star Trek: Nemesis DVD also has some rather interesting extras, including an audio commentary by director Stuart Baird, who speaks in an almost soft whisper as he shares his thoughts about the film and what he was forced to cut out (such as Riker playing his trombone or more scenes with Data's cat, Spot).  Four featurettes and a photo gallery are also present, each discussing different aspects of the film, from directing, character development, action, special effects, and even a small possibility, by Patrick Stewart himself, for a potential sequel.  Many will find the nine \\"deleted scenes\\" section on the DVD fascinating.  Highlights include an intimate discussion between Picard and Data (who looks at the Captains flute from \\"The Inner Light\\" tv episode) about getting older, a second rape scene on Troi by Shinzon in a turbolift (which was partly shown in the Nemesis theatrical trailer), and an extended ending which shows a new first officer taking over for Riker (who is leaving with Troi to become Captain of the starship Titan), as well as Picard's Captain's chair finally being fitted with automatic seatbelts.<br />     So show your support and pick up this DVD today.  There are still many more stories to be told with the Next Generation crew of the starship Enterprise.  Let them be made into a reality on the big screen.  <br />                               Engage.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Some of the songs on this album took a couple listens at first, but after a week or two of not listening to it, then coming back to it...I couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it! After hearing very terrible reviews for this album, I really feel that a lot of critics didn't even give this record a chance. Every critic so far has mentioned that the lyrics on this album are &quot;superficial&quot; and &quot;under-developed&quot;. For years Madonna's lyrics have been ambigious, mysterious &amp; poetic, but the lyrics on this album are straight-forward, HONEST, &amp; to-the-point...giving us a clearer idea of who Madonna is as a person. Critics &amp; people expect *so* much from her as a super celebrity, that they can't even take her having a vulnerable moment for one second. Many of the songs on this album illustrate clearer representation of Madonna's true emotions of love, sorrow &amp; happiness. After hearing all of Madonna's albums, I would have to rate this one as her most personal &amp; genuine. THIS is who Madonna is. This album has a lot of wonderful love songs, &quot;Intervention&quot; has a fabulous vocal arrangement &amp; the lyrics are beautiful, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is reminicent of &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, singing about faith &amp; love. The vulnerable, &quot;X-Static Process&quot; showcases Madonna's sensitivity in relationships, with very raw lyrics. &quot;Easy Ride&quot; is a song about the struggles &amp; ordeals of coping with celebrity life, &amp; who better to hear it from than Madonna? Other more upbeat tracks include &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Love Profusion&quot; &amp; the hit, &quot;American Life&quot;. I would rank this album in the Top three of Madonna's best albums of all time.
B00008LDPU|5.0|Wow. That's all I could say throughout the time I watched this DVD. If you're into the Matrix and seek a significantly clearer understanding of the concept, buy this DVD and watch it. If you just want awesome anime action, buy this DVD. If you are looking for something new, buy this DVD. It will keep your attention for all 90 minutes. Watch it, and be enlightened.
0441003257|5.0|I'm a fan of Neil Gaiman's work, although I've not read anything else by Pratchett (not generally favoring his almost slapstick style), but this book was a wonderful blend of the both.  The plot is quick and tight, the footnotes are as entertaining as the rest of the story, and - hey, who knew the apocalypse could end up being so fun(ny).
6304698798|5.0|Okay, who holds the record for having seen this movie the most times?? I've seen it maybe 5 times, and I know I'm not even in the running. My 18yo kid says he's seen it about 10 times (and he says he wants Blondie's cigar). My father, who is 89, has seen it maybe 20 times (by his admittedly vague recollection).<BR>Any movie that can span the affections of 3 generations deserves 5-star rating.<BR>Why can't all Westerns be like this, made up of bad guys, badder buys, and the really bad, bad guys? Angel Eyes is the personification of suave evil, like a beautiful deadly snake; Blondie represents honor among thieves. But oh, every time Tuco comes on the scene, he steals the show. Who will ever forget his wavering alliances, his race through the cemetery, his face at the stagecoach when he realizes Blondie holds the missing piece of information: the name on the grave where the gold is buried, his whimpering at the end as he balanced on a crumbling cemetery cross with a noose around his neck? And the music! Doo-y-ooo-y-oooooo....Wah WAH Wah... Spectacular. 10 stars, please.<BR>Now I'm going to go watch it again, and try to catch up with my dad.
0789723107|5.0|The title says it all. The typical web surfer will not give your website the benefit of the doubt; they want to get in and get out quickly while being informed at the same time. Too many web designers/programmers fail to give usability the importance it deserves. This book is a good introduction to making site more customer-friendly, and it's written in a very approachable format. There are plenty of illustrations and screen shots to help demonstrate points made throughout the book. Steve Krug has brought a little fun into the usability realm.
B00005UQ9F|3.0|I was very disappointed with this film.  Though it was well acted, the storyline left alot to be desired.  The movie plodded along with a lot of character development, which is usually a good thing save when it comes at the expense of any sort of real or long lasting suspense.  I often wondered when the thrills would begin, when things would start to pick up, when they would start to explain why I should be interested and scared at what I was seeing.  They never really came.      In movies like this, where the source of thrills is left ambiguous, it can sometimes fall down to whether or not you decide to care.  [SPOILER ALERT] Along the way there are hints of an evil presence, an entity that \\"lives in the weak and wounded\\" and causes people to hurt others violently.  For instance, does the sudden insanity and inexplicable turn to murder of the main character entail supsense and terror simply because they play scary music and jumpy sound effects at the \\"right\\" time?  The movie never really decides if the evil entity is the twist, or if its just a story that ups the creepy factor.  In so doing, it was questionable that the movie was really \\"Session 9\\" and not \\"Crazy Waste Eliminators 5.\\"  Because, if you couldn't guess, without something involved, the story amounts to the life and times of five dudes and their garbage removal hijinks.
0156027321|5.0|&quot;Life of Pi&quot; packs so much into a little book.  It starts off as a whimsical story of Indian teenager and his confusion about life, religion, and animals (his father is a zookeeper).  It is reminiscent of John Irving's &quot;Son of a Circus&quot;, and it bit like Salman Rushdie's &quot;Midnight's Children&quot; but more fun.  The story then takes a much more adventurous turn when the boy and his family embark on a sea voyage to Canada.  No spoilers here, but what a fascinating story.  While a book for all ages I think &quot;Life of Pi&quot; will become a classic for the &quot;I am too old for Harry Potter, really!&quot; teenaged set.<br />Bottom line: simply wonderful.  Fully deserving of the Booker prize.
B00006JJ1O|1.0|god, this music is soooo annoying! and didn't Britney already do the schoolgirl thing? they can only kiss each other while performing so many times before everyone gets tired of it. <BR>boring.
0786711647|5.0|Ira Levin is one of my favorite writers.  While his stories are a bit far-fetched (as with \\"Rosemary's Baby\\", \\"The Boys From Brazil\\", and \\"The Stepford Wives\\") they are always entertaining.  His first book, \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\", is now largely forgotten (..it was written nearly 50 years ago) but seems remarkably fresh.<br />In \\"A Kiss Before Dying\\" we have a a rich college girl and her gold-digging boyfriend in a dilemna.  The girl is pregnant and the choice ahead is grim: either get married and lose daddy's money, or risk an illegal abortion (remember this book takes place circa 1950).  She prefers the former, he the latter.  The outcome of this dilemna is unexpected (no spoilers here), and the story then really kicks into gear.  Yes, in true Levin form the plot is a bit contrived.  But it is deliciously readable.<br />Bottom line: strongly recommended.
B000096I9G|5.0|There is not whole lot to say, this is The Cure at their best. You are not looking at crowd shots in this video, you are watching The Cure play out three of their greatest albums (recordings). This is a MUST!!!!!!, for a Cure fan.
6305907145|4.0|i believe when making a movie adaptation of a book, esp. from a very different time period, one has to consider the fact that the director and all involved are working in the present and therefore to be historically faithful and precise to the book is always interpretive. I applaud any director who will use their own creative and conceptual knowledge to bring out an interpretation that is also relevent with today's times - it is a dialogue between the book, its history and the movie medium [see Women in Love]. Any reader of any book has a subjective opinion. I've read all of Austen's books EXCEPT for Mansfield Park [i have to admit i avoided it because i didn't like the heroine's name] and now because of this movie I am compelled to read the book. That in itself is a good thing - most movie adaptations of books these days make people read less - this makes me want to read more. Most Austen movie adaptations are predictable and somewhat fluffy and I'd be hard-pressed to believe that Austen herself would discourage her work to be remade with another concept in mind. The director granted me a different take on Jane Austen and because I love her novels so much, I am glad to see even more how her writing impacts on my life through the issues and imagery brought up in this movie.
B00005JKPF|5.0|This movie was definitely one of the best ever! I personally think it out did the first one! Back with a great director and the greatest cast I have ever seen! This movie has everything! It picks up exactly where it left off making it easy to catch up especially for those who may or may not have seen the first one at all or in a long time. It gives you the romance between Iceman-A.K.A Bobby-and Rogue, and between Wolverine, Cyclops and Jean Gray. The action with the all new and completely awsome Nightcrawler. William Stryker comes in too, and gives you another bad guy with more plans for domination giving you an all time thriller! Abosolutely AWSOME!
6305313687|5.0|I was sitting around watching the Independent Film Channel when all of a sudden this movie came on. It looked good, so I decided to watch it. Also, I heard of it before. As I got into the movie, I began to enjoy, unlike a lot of the movies on this channel. <br />The movies about a young teenager who really wants to be a skinhead like his older brother Derek Vinyard, who is famous for starting up a group of skinheads in Venus Beach, California. The trouble start up when Derek goes off to jail for killing two young African Americans who were breaking into his car on night. <br />The movie starts off with Danny, the young skinhead brother, getting in trouble with the principle of his school, who happens to be African American, for writing a book report on Mein Kumph, Adolf Hitler's autobiography. The teacher now sends Danny into a class which he will teach named American History X. To start off the class, Danny has to write a new report on his brother Derek. Even though Danny hates the idea, he still agrees to write the paper. <br />Around this time, Derek is released from jail. However, his look has changed. He no longer pocesses his rebellious bald scalp, but a full head of hair. He is met early by the still bald-headed Danny, who tells him about the report he has to do. Shocking to the boy, Derek tells him to do the report, and says it wasn't a good idea for him to write on Hitler. Derek also discovers that Danny has joined the group that he had been a part of, and taken the same mentor that Derek took when he was a skin. <br />Intense, disturbing, and touching at times, American History X gives the story of a family who has been torn down by racism. With excellant performances from Edward Nortan and Edward Furlong, this movie packs a message about the neo-Nazi skinheads of America. This is definatly a movie anyone on the planet shoulld see. It pulls in family, anti-racism, and changes that will shock you until the end.

B00005JLWN|4.0|I didn't expect much when I rented this DVD. I had never heard anything about Equilibrium when it came out in theaters last December and I'm sure I wasn't the only one. The film bombed as could be expected since not many were even aware of its existence. And then, the marketing team tried to connect it with the Matrix phenomenon to get their products known, even putting references to it on the cover of the DVD. I agree with some reviews that the implied connection does somewhat of a disservice to the movie. This is no Matrix as it shouldn't be, even though a few minor elements might be seen by some as \\"Matrix-influenced\\".<br />After a third world war, a new regime has decreed that feelings are dangerous and the cause of every human being's self-destructive behavior. Therefore, they decided to suppress emotions in the population by using regular doses of a drug which will inhibit their capacity to feel. \\"Clericals\\" are highly trained officiers hunting down and executing \\"sense offenders\\", who are people that stopped using the drug. This premise is actually interesting even though not necessarily new, with obvious references to \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"1984\\" among others. <br />Shot on a very low budget especially for a sci-fi flick, some of the special effects are definitely on the cheap side but surprisingly, the whole look of the movie is quite stunning. Dark and greyish tones are utilized in different sets to evoke a sense of rigidity and coldness which fits well with the storyline. The plot is fairly simple but engaging, even though many aspects of it border on the cliche and seem convoluted at times. But despite its flaws, I found myself quite engrossed in the story even though it still felt like a [copy] from so many other sci-fi movies I had seen.<br />One thing that really irritated me about this though, as some reviewers have pointed out, is the fact that all the actors who were supposed to play characters unable to feel would emote all over the place. In the short documentary about the making of the movie, the director explains that he made the conscious decision to have the actors avoid playing their characters as \\"zombies\\" because he felt like it would have been much less interesting for the audience. Excuse me? Personally, seeing all those actors show every emotion in the book made the whole purpose of the story seem ridiculous and pointless.<br />Christian Bale as the lead probably gives the best performance, even if he has some trouble making the switch from cold to emotional seem fluid. Then again, how is the audience supposed to see the difference between a character who is still under the influence of the drug and one who isn't when everybody acts the same way? I must admit this really bothered me because I feel like the movie could have been even better if the acting was more in accordance with the story.<br /> This said, I still enjoyed Equilibrium quite a lot as I was able to suspend disbelief long enough to not let this big flaw ruin my appreciation of the film. I won't pretend this is a masterpiece but rather, a good \\"little\\" movie who deserves to be seen and appreciated. Four stars seemed appropriate here as I felt like, although not the best sci-fi I've ever seen, it is far from being the worst either. It has a coolness and sophistication which redeems its flaws and I truly feel like the movie deserves an audience. Give it a try if you are a sci-fi fan.
0440237688|4.0|Lois Lowry's book \\"the Giver\\" is awsome, i loved it. The whole conseps was facinating. This book is about a community which is vary different than ours today. i dont want to give the book away but the end of this book is vary different.well i suggest you read it because my class loved it, and so did i. So dont even hesitate to buy it because you will LOVE IT!!!
6305508550|5.0|GREAT movie! I especially appreciate the office humor after having worked for two large semiconductor manufacturing companies...won't mention any names. Anyone in similar fields will really appreciate the humor in the movie. The soundtrack isn't too bad, either.
B000021XR5|2.0|Stone Temple Pilots is one of the more stunning grunge groups, with amazing songs, however i was the least bit impressed by no.4 it was what you get if you mixed the dave matthews band and pearl jam, it was good all the same but nothing compared to any of there other albums.  The Skinny:Best song-Sex and violence <BR>and down
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I saw the T.A.T.U. video on MTV and I really like the song Not Gonna Get Us, so I decided to get the cd. The lyrics are kind of simple, but the beats of most of the songs are great. I believe that about three of the songs are in Russian as well.<br />All in all, I think this CD is worth buying, just for the simple fact that it is a fun album and you can dance to it. Plus, it is really fun to drive to as well!
0679721037|5.0|Great account and read!
B00008H2LB|5.0|If you liked their first album, then Linkin Park's second should be as pleasing.  The songs are intense both in lyrics and in sound; they flow from one into another which may be confusing for the listener but I say treat it as an album and not as a much of singles and you'll do fine.  I loved the fact that the songs blend so well into each other.  Just wish I could understand the lyrics better and not have to rely so heavily on the enclosed booklet to figure out what is being said.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My wife and I love this film.  Anime isn't usually &quot;our thing,&quot; but this film goes beyond all else!
B00008GKEG|5.0|This DVD set is, by far, the definitive video document of the rise and fall of what is arguably the greatest band to ever crank out a tune.  From their humble roots as children in Liverpool, through the early years as a quintet (without Ringo Starr, mind you) touring as naive teens in Hamburg, their rise to world superstardom, and what would eventually turn out to be one of the most devastating and painful breakups in rock history...it's all here.  The entire story is told in the words of the Beatles themselves, offering not just a basic history lesson, but true insight into what was going on behind the scenes in terms of thoughts, reasons, and emotions.  When I finished watching this incredible 10+ hours of video, I felt that I truly understood not only what the Fab Four were all about, but how they personally experienced the times as well.<br />  Having been born just late enough to have actually lived through the Beatlemania period, without being able to really appreciate what was going on around me, I found \\"Anthology\\" to be not only entertaining and informative, but very \\"memory intensive\\".  Events that I only vaguely remember being on television finally come alive with all the details that my young mind couldn't quite comprehend at the time.  I was, after all, only 6, when the Beatles played Candlestick Park, a mere 10 miles from my home.  But once I became a fan, just about the time they broke up, I was pretty much absorbed into the legend.<br />  Technically, this set is one of the best I own.  The EXTENSIVE concert footage (covering the entire span of their group career) put me right there with the band for some of the most memorable live performances ever recorded.  The overwhelming majority of footage is crystal clear, and edited very well, giving a true concert feel.  And remixing all the cuts into 5.1 surround has brought out some of the incredible detail of The Beatles' music...some of which is sadly missing from the CD versions of the same songs!<br />  I would have willingly paid twice what I did for this set, and still would have been ecstatic with the results.  Superior story, fantastic footage, and awesome audio make this THE collection to own, whether you are a diehard Beatles fan, or just want to find out what all the fuss was about.  This Magical History Tour WILL take you away...
B00006HBUA|5.0|Did you ever watch a movie, watch it again and watched it<br />yet another time, but just never grew tired of seeing it?<br />That is how our family feels about this movie.<br /> Set on Spooky Island, the Scooby Gang sets out to solve a<br />mystery, but not as a group, they each plan to figure this one<br />out alone.  The characters are charming, the special effects<br />are great, the mystery is just right for all ages.<br />  This was one of those movies that you are sorry it is over.<br />Very well done, great job all the way around!
6303477259|5.0|This is by far the greatest live performance of all time.  The only thing I regret is not having been there in person.  Some are upset by the lack of Roger Waters, but ive seen his live stuff that he does on his own, and its not nearly as good.  The way I see it, Waters is the artistic visionary, but Gilmour and company have the ability to bring it to life musically and instrumentally.  Guy Pratt (new guy on bass) is better at bass than waters anyway.  BUY THIS VIDEO!!!!
B000002JPA|5.0|As a whole, Dream Theater, in my opinion, is one of the greatest bands to graces God's green Earth. Images And Words is one of my favorite CDs that gets great attention in my library (I've already bought 2 copies, working on my third), and for good reason too. The CD plays extremely smooth from the first track to the last, which is a very rare feat to accomplish in today's music world, where everybody wants to throw in some filler tracks and just get their almighty dollar. This CD boasts classic DT tracks such as &quot;Metropolis: Part 1,&quot; an insane sonic orgasm of catchy hooks, tight musicianship and explosive solos. &quot;Pull me Under&quot; is definitly one of everybody's favorites, with the mind-numbing chorus and a guitar solo that'll have me tingling for years. And because I play guitar, I must brag about &quot;Under a Glass Moon,&quot; the song is insanely high on the musician-o-meter and the guitar solo is just plain wrong...almost too wrong. <BR>All in all, IW is definitly one of the greatest album on the planet, as is every other DT album out there. It gets my 2 thumbs up, and if I ever grow more, I'll let ya know.
B00008DZ0J|5.0|Real rock and roll.  No pop on this album.  All you'd hope to expect from the peppermint twins.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This set is simply rock and roll nirvana.  The way rock-n-roll should be played.  Nothing more needs to be said!  But I will say more.  If there is one highlight on this CD, one song you could listen to to really GET this band, it would be Stairway to Heaven.  Now, you say, of course.  That's probably their biggest song ever.  And yes, that would be true.  If you listen to enough live Zeppelin you soon realize that Page plays guitar solos different EVERY TIME.  This particular version of Stairway is one of the best I've ever heard.  The ABSOLUTE BEST would be the DVD version, hands down.  Now, to this one.  Listen closely to the solo and you will hear in certain sections that Bonzo matches the solo on the drums.  When I first noticed this I actually went back and listened to that section several times.  It really is remarkable because Bonzo doesn't catch up until a couple of beats into it.  It shows how tight they were that he could notice what Page was doing and double it until he ran it out.  I would challenge you to find a modern band that does anything close to this.  It's why Zeppelin will always be the greatest rock and roll band ever.
B00003CX9E|1.0|What they forgot to put in the DVD set is the documentary \\"The Hype Behind Citizen Kane\\", which tells a story how this film unrighteously claims the title of the best American film. This movie is so boring and put audience throught a story of a man's empty life that would only interest few people.
B00002E233|4.0|This is a fun shark film.  It does not have the suspense levels of Jaws (mostly because we can see the sharks more often) but it certainly has its moments.<br />A major firm is funding a research facility studying sharks to find a cure for Alzheimers and other degenerative brain diseases.  The plug is going to be pulled from the facility as one of their sharks had escaped and caused some scares before being recaptured.<br />But with 48 hours, positive results may be had.  The result is that Samuel Jackson travels to the facility between shifts (read that as smaller cast) to witness a test.<br />A &quot;protein complex' is taken from the brain of one of the test sharks and it does, indeed, reanimate inactive brain tissue.  But then the test shark wakes up, chomps an arm and is released back into the pens.<br />Scientist sans arm must be evacuated while a hurricane batters the facility.  Guess what happens.  The rescue is botched, the facility is breach and blows up, and the two smaller sharks can now swim through the flooded corridors.<br />The main characters try to avoid flood waters and killer sharks as they try to find a way back to the surface.  But then we learn that the sharks were genetically manipulated to give them bigger brains.  It also made them smarter.<br />Although the station is flooding, it is not the best environment for sharks so the cast are able to fight back to a degree that would not be possible in the open ocean.<br />Tense moments abound until the film's end when the survivors she the next shift arriving by boat.<br />One thing that sets this movie apart from other shark movies (except Jaws) is that the sharks are physically real.  Two huge animatronic sharks were built that could swim and act like any other shark.  CGI was only briefly used in two short spots to minimize danger to the actors from an 8000 pound robot.  The result is some nasty looking sharks.<br />One of the better shark films around.  The DVD has some commentary, five deleted scenes (only one of which could have added to the final film) and a documentary about how the sharks were built.
B00000JMQE|5.0|I was subjected to watching The Wizard Of Oz every year while I was growing up. I am sure that it is a fine movie, but I truly became tired of it and now prefer to not watch it. When my wife suggested watching Return to Oz I simply stated that I had never heard of it and was slightly scared of what it might be like. I LOVED IT! I was relieved to see a different cast and entirely different feel to the movie. This movie will surprise you with the slight darkness to it, but keep you very entertained. This one I can watch more than once a year and still look forward to seeing it again.
B00003CXXP|2.0|Haley Joel Osment gives an excellent performance as a robot. First as a merely advanced unit, and then as one that can truly feel emotion. Jude Law also puts in a very strong performance as a gigolo robot.<br />The time is the future and much of the world was flooded when the ice caps melted. Resources are very low, so robots are popular because they do not consume resources. This explanation should have been left out of the film as the visually show excess after excess.<br />Haley is a robot designed to be a loving young boy. He is tested by a family that has lost a young son to a disease that currently has him frozen awaiting a miracle cure.<br />Slowly Haley wins over the mother to the point that she activates his imprinting routines. Suddenly he is a little boy and not an appliance. Their relationship grows.<br />But suddenly a cure is found and Martin, the original son, returns. He does not like David (Haley). He taunts him and tries to get him in trouble. Because of this, David looks like he might be dangerous. The mother takes David out to the woods and abandons him ala Hansel and Gretel.<br />David learns of the dark underbelly of society, first with the Flesh Fair where robots are destroyed in spectacular ways and later in many various forms. It is at the Fair that he teams up with Joe (Law).<br />Now David becomes obsessed with the idea of the Blue Fairy who made Pinocchio into a real boy. David now has a purpose and Joe will help him.<br />The quest leads to Man-Hattan and his original creator. There is no Blue Fairy. There is no hope. David jumps into the ocean only to be rescued by Joe just after a new hope forms. David believes that the Blue Fairy lives just under the water.<br />David travels underwater to the remains of Coney Island where he gets trapped in front of a statue of the Blue Fairy. He is trapped for 2000 years. He is rescued by future robots who have never seen humans (who made them?). David is a robot who has interacted with humans, therefore he is important to the future robots.<br />Now it really get silly. The new robots offer to resurrect David's mother. He agrees. Then they tell him it is only good for one day. They don't say why she can't be resurrected again. David wants her. She is resurrected, they spend a day together and David goes to sleep and has his first dream (but what of his dream to be a real boy?).<br />I really got the feeling that this film was made because there were some new special effects techniques that Spielberg wanted to test and didn't want to wait for the right story. I never was able to grasp where the story really wanted to go. It seemed to have a very dark path for most of the film with all desires and dreams being squashed.<br />The ending made no real sense and the idea that David would now go one for untold thousands of years more without love was never dealt with or even brought up. I really do not recommend this one for any reason other than the strength of the acting.
B00008DDSC|5.0|It really has been awhile since a smart, sly, and extremely sexy romance has come along. It's not the S & M side of this movie that makes it refreshing (although it is personally something new to me). It's the way the subject is handled with taste and style. Maggie Gyllenhaal in one of her first starring roles, gives a startling and real performance as Lee, a troubled woman just out of the mental institution. To help steer herself towards sanity again, she takes a job as a secretary with lawyer E. Edward Gray (James Spader, who although is playing a character similar to the one in 's,l,&v', plays his role wonderfully). At first the work is pretty typical but then he begins reprimanding her for typing errors and the like. It starts out mild but it soon escalates to spankings. And Lee likes it. Her relationship with Gray awakens her and she becomes a new and stronger person. But there's trouble in paradise when Gray begins to feel disgusted with himself. There's more but that will remain undisclosed. I'll start off by saying this film is definately not for everyone. But those who venture into the territory will find something in this movie to latch onto. Despite the fact that the cover and opening music scream 'soft core porn', this is a die-hard romance in disguise. So those who are willing to take the plunge, I say, dive right in. You will be, ahem, satisfied.
B000096I9G|3.0|I have been a fan of The Cure for almost 20 years. I have all their cd's and many imports, I was kinda disappointed when I bought this DVD, I found it very long and not to exctiting. Don't get me wrong The Cure is very entertaining, but I enjoy The Cure in Orange and Show much better then this one. He seemed to have less energy onstage in Trilogy. But over all I think it is great if you are a die-hard Cure fan. I do love them, but not this DVD. This is just my honest opinion!!
B000002534|5.0|This is Carlos at his most expansive, free and heedless of commercial demands. Yes,Supernatural was a comeback: to commercial pop. Commercial pop does not need Santana. Instead of making another Supernatural in Shaman, he should have made another Borboletta. This album has his best band, his best vocalist and some great songs. This album is a timeless classic and sounds as good now as when I bought it in 1975. If Santana is remembered for one album it should be Borboletta.
B000089RVX|3.0|I have to agree with the first paragraph that I read.  The lead singer has an extremely strong voice, but by the time you get to the end of the album it seems like all the songs somehow run into each other.  They have alot of talent and with a little creative energy they can have an outstanding album.  As far as the Lincoln Park reference, there knew hit does resemble Lincoln Park, but if you listen to the whole album they are not trying to imitate them.  Bottom line, I would buy this cd again.
B00005JKZV|5.0|As may of the other reviewers have said: it is a great film, definatly one of the best ever films, Gollum was brillaint, all the characters suit there actors/actresses and the special effects are quality. However they have massacred the book. Ive made a little list :p - they got treebeard and the ents totally wrong, missed out erkenbrand coming with gandalf to helms deeps aid, the hourns as helms deep are missing, gandalf and theoden going to isengard and the palantir, the whole shelob episode,they got faramir totally wrong, added a stupid osgilliath bit and i also thought the return of gandalf was wrong. If you want a brilliant lord of the rings abridged story get the BBC Audio Lord of the Rings as i have bin addicted for the last 16 years and the Gollums voices is the best ive ever heard!!!! hope u find this helpful
B000002WU9|5.0|wu-tang, one of the more notorious but underappreciated rap groups in history. with the exceptions of masta killa and cappadonna you cannot say there is one sub-par lyricist (odb is average...). and with ob4cl raekwon leaps ahead of other, more renowned wu rappers. true hip hop heads rate this album as one of the top 10 of all time.<br />knuckleheadz is a solid track, but outshined by the next three. knowledge god is a simple repetitive beat that echoes in your mind. ghost comes hard in criminology, and incarcerated scarfaces is one of my favorite tracks.<br />i am not going to go through every track, but there is only one bad song, ice water. i dont know what the rza was thinking keeping that annoying beat on a song.<br />the bottom line is that rza comes with some amazing beats, and though there are a few cameos, they are stellar. nas is flawless as always on verbal intercourse, ghost compliments the chef amazingly, and meth comes hard on ice cream and other tracks.<br />i was blown away by this cd...pick it up
B00004XONN|5.0|This album, like any other really, cannot be rated as an album on first listen. Any good band makes an albums for which your love and appreciation grows with each hearing. No other album I've listened to suits this idea as much as Kid A. The first time I heard this, it was just a strange collection of sounds. This seems to be most people's first impression of it, that it's not as much music as modern art for a new millenium. This view of the album persisted for awhile. My dislike for Kid A's inaccessibility seemed to grow with time and I eventually stopped listening to it altogether, getting into Radiohead's other numerous masterpieces. But this album kept on getting into my consciousness. I decided to give it another spin.<br />My opinion immediately changed. I loved it and my love has only grown with time. This album is not pure technological ramblings; it's beautiful art rock with a technological backdrop. From the opening synth notes of 'Everything in its Right Place', this album sets a mood. An unsettling mood, yes, but one that burrows into your mind and makes a lasting, even profound impression. This song moves into the oriental xylophone chords and obscure, subtle beat, and obscure, technologically-muffled lyrics of the title track. The next track, 'The National Anthem,' thunders right along with its catchy bass riff and horns that start off relatively normal but soon digress into a blaring wall of sound. Next comes 'How to Disappear Completely,' among the most haunting and beautiful songs on the record, a song that hints at isolation with the world around and wanting to escape. This is followed by the relaxing (believe-it-or-not) guitar sounds of Ed O'Brien. 'Optimistic' is the song on here that sounds most like prior Radiohead tracks, never a bad thing. A nice little section at the end of this song leads into 'In Limbo,' a haunting piece with spiralling lyrics and guitar. A bid at genius techno beats follows with 'Idioteque,' and Radiohead succeeds by great bounds. 'Morning Bell' is an interesting song to say the least. It's about divorce; keep that in mind when Thom sings of 'cutting the kids in half.' It's not as morbid as it seems. The album closes out on a heavenly note with the album's most beautiful, touching, amazing, and overall best song, 'Motion Picture Soundtrack.' This song is basically Thom singing over organ and harp. The highlight of the album is probably the most heart-wrenchingly lovely line ever penned: 'I will see you in the next life.' The way this line is crooned falsetto over the spiralling music can't help but make you feel emotional.<br />This is an album that grows on you over time. Mind you, it can take a lot of time for this appreciation to kick in. Musically, this is the most fulfilling, if not favorite, album I have ever bought.
B00005JL9B|5.0|The concept is a class of grade school students are put on a deserted island and are forced to kill each other off. Yes indeed, the plot is Japanese. So is the copious amount of blood, and the way people act. But Battle Royale manages to surpass these attributes. This is an honest to god good movie. Different side plots emerge, the action scenes are extremely well done, there are great characters, you can follow the entire process death by death... It's a great movie! There are some parts that are bizarre: a nerd walks up to our favorite couple with a gun saying \\"y=-x!\\", but if you can see past the gore, you'll love it
B0000041Q3|5.0|I have listened to several &quot;Turandots&quot; and this one will always be my favorite. The chorus, orchestra, and singers are superb! The pacing and choral work are gorgeous. Of course Pavarotti's signature &quot;Nessun dorma&quot; is unsurpassed. I know others may disagree, but just listen to the finales of each act of this Puccini masterpiece and see if they are not the most moving ever recorded. The end of Act II is especially overwhelming. I never fail to get goose bumps just thinking about it. You will not be disappointed and this too will be among your favorite all time recordings. An historic great!
0553103547|5.0|The world of Westeros, the setting for A Song of Ire and Fire, contains the perfect balance of realism and magic that has been missing in the genre for some time (are you listening Forgotten Realms editors?).  We find moral ambiguity and the constant and real threat of an untimely demise, even for the most important characters.  The characters are well-nuanced, with real motives and human passions.  Magic is reserved for the few and, when it manifests, it does so in incredible displays of power.<br />I labeled Martin's prose \\"raw\\" and \\"reckless\\" because he does not appear to be afraid of any theme or issue and he turns many conventional fantasy elements on their collective heads.  Martin, quite simply, is the best fantasy author since Moorcock.<br />A warning:  don't buy this book unless you are prepared to purchase the entire series.  The books are, at once, compelling and addictive page-turners that will leave you clamoring for more.
B000002AZ8|4.0|Many Pearl Jam fans are divided into two categories:  those who love \\"Ten\\" and \\"Vs.\\" for their accessible, energetic rock music; and then there are those who embrace Pearl Jam's entire catalog.  \\"Vitalogy\\" marked the album that alienated the millions of fans that were hoping for a continuation in the same vein of music as before.  The music is darker, less catchy and definitely a far cry from the classic rock tendencies of previous albums.  Those who take the trip into \\"Vitalogy\\" with an open mind will be rewarded however, with music that is at the level of Pearl Jam's finest work.  <br />Every true song on this album is a highlight all things considered.  Pry to, Bugs, Aye Davanita and Stupid Mop are tracks of quirky filler that when listened to as a whole with the rest of the album work quite well.  Unfortunately, by themselves they make no sense and can be quite annoying (especially the last track, which I never listen to).  Luckily, the other ten songs on the album are wonderful.  Last Exit is a tense, off kilter rocker that sounds like it will fall apart at any second.  Not For You is a Pearl Jam classic, with seething vocals and a guitar line that is to die for.  This one is played at nearly every Pearl Jam concert.  Nothingman is the album's centerpiece, a truly beautiful, soaring ballad that stands as one of Pearl Jam's best songs.  Corduroy is another concert staple, an alternating punk-rock and pop song that works to great effect.  Everyone who has ever listened to modern rock radio has heard Better Man, which is a great song (hard for me to listen to anymore though).  The final great song on the album is Immortality, a dark acoustic-based rocker with a great acoustic solo by Mike.  <br />While I can't give this CD 5 stars because of the senseless tracks that make up too great a part of this CD, I must rave about the music contained within this disc.  \\"Vitalogy\\" acted as the introduction to the next chapter of the Pearl Jam legacy.  After this CD, Pearl Jam continued to stray from the public's eye, crafting music that became increasingly detached from the classic rock that made them stars.  If you truly love the sound of Pearl Jam, you already have this album.  If you don't own it though, there is absolutely no logical reason reason why not, and you should buy this wonderful CD today.  Long live PJ!<br />Dan
B000089RVX|2.0|this cd is uimpressive, i listened the single they have on radio and was captivated with the female vocalist but the poppy music and raped male singind messed the whole song, so i decided to listen to the cd (burned of course) expecting something more and it was the same riffs and same structures and gets boring and repetitive. compared to goth bands (lacuna coil, moonspell, tiamat, the gathering) they fail, and compared with really great bands with female vocalist (new arch enemy, lacuna coil, nightwish, sinergy) they fall even further, so like others say, the lead singer should break with those linkin park wannabees and start again with better musicians or more mature writers.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is where Metallica reached there peak. This is an amazing album. The songwriting on this album is amazing. This album really shows how talented the guys in Metallica are. There is only one flaw in this album and that is the production. Everything else is perfect. Form Blacked to Dyers Eve this album is a non-stop assault of incredible riffs, solos, pounding double-bass drums and epic intros/instrumentals. Every song on here is perfect with none sounding repetitive. This is for sure Metallica's most complete album and there crowning achivement. This unfortunately IMO would be there last great album. This album truly shows how great metal can be. I will never get tired of this album, it is perfect in every way, thank you Metallica for this wondeful piece of music. For all metal fans this album is a must, Buy it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I bought this cd after hearing it play at a local bookstore and am absolutely thrilled with it! It is one of those cds that I never get tired of and so far there are only two of those...this one and the Sarah Mclachlan cd Surfacing.  This cd is so mellow and soothing and as I drive for my job all day it really relaxes me and helps me to sink into daydreams and escape the world!!
0800141660|5.0|I couldn't wait to get the dvd in the mail.  I truly enjoyed watching this masterpiece; I actually saw it a few times!!  Worth watching if you are into Victorian era movies!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Get this album. Best think from Radiohead since 'OK Computer'.
B00005MP58|5.0|Not as good as Sense and Sensibility; took me awhile to really get into the movie; I truly think I liked the movie because the setting was from a by gone era; a \\"romantic era\\" a time when \\"life was simple but there were so many rules to everything you did\\"; kind of makes you happy you live in today!  I do have to rate it a 5 star just because I am a \\"sucker\\" for Victorian type movies!!!
B0000029GA|4.0|Yall crazy saying Nas is better than JAY-Z .Nas is the king of contadiction he is not real.He is a good rapper but he is not deep like people think he is .He is not even better than Busta Rhymes,M.O.P OR Eminem.
6305041156|2.0|\\"Ran\\" is a Japanese Samurai movie directed by Akira Korusawa.  It is about a powerful Japanese warlord who is nearing the end of his life and is ready to divide his land and power between either his sons or his peers.  Hidetora, the lord chooses to divide his belongings between his sons, Taro, Jiro and Saburo  Taro and Jiro are the two eldest sons respectively, and they look down on Saburo.  They treat him like an ignorant boy.  They are do-gooders, and kiss up to their father even when he isn't even listening to them.  Saburo has more sense than Taro and Jiro, and he thinks about things before he decides to believe them.  He knows how relationships work, rather than how they're expected to.  Hidetora gives Taro supreme power and the first castle with its surrounding lands.  Jiro gets the second castle and its surroundings, and Saburo gets the third castle and its surroundings.  After Hidetora makes this announcement, he presents a metaphor to his sons', which states that a single arrow is weaker than a bundle of three arrows.  Taro and Jiro easily accept the metaphor.  Saburo, after thinking about it and applies its meaning to real life decides it wouldn't work in his and his brothers situation and defies his father by showing that it's possible to break three arrows together, and says that the sons will not get along if sharing land and power.  After this act of disrespect, Hidetora banishes Saburo and this later on sparks civil war between the three sons.  Taro (yellow), Jiro (red), Saburo (blue), and Ayabe (black) all eventually go to war for the lands, and in the end Ayabe wins after the deaths of all the brothers.    <BR>\\"Ran\\" is the Japanese version of Shakespeare's \\"King Lear\\".  The plot is good, partly because it is based on a great play, but overall, I didn't enjoy the movie.  It looked as if Hidetora was wearing a phony mask, or had a very overdone make-up job.  The acting was very forced and seemed staged.  The way the speech sounded was also forced, andnothing seemed natural to the actors.  The fight scenes, which I will admit were cool at first, went on way too long, and were just the same thing over and over again.  They became redundant and boring.  All of the battles had tons of blood.  The blood looked like cheap paint, and it dominated many of the shots.  There would be ten men all piled together, looking like they were marinated in paint after a fight scene.  Each shot was about a minute long, which seemed like an eternity for most all of them, and it made the movie much longer than it could've been.  One thing I liked was to see how everything came together in the end in the deaths of all three brothers and the father, and the victory by Ayabe and his army in the civil war that took place during the bulk of the movie.<BR>Another thing the movie did well was display the life of a Samurai in Japan.  Although they were kiss-ups, Taro and Jiro showed great respect, and patience with their father.  Saburo showed great thought, and comprehension of situations.  Hidetora was very wise and respected.  He was a great warrior, which is an inference I picked up when I learned he owned three castles and their lands, all of which he gained through war.<BR>All in all, I didn't like \\"Ran\\".  If I ever want a story like it again, I'll go ahead and read \\"King Lear\\", but if you've already seen or read \\"King Lear\\", and want a different point of view from a different society, then \\"Ran\\" may be a great movie for you.
B000092ZYY|5.0|This is a very complex album, and difficult to easily review. It has at least three main levels of enjoyment. I'll start with saying I did indeed download the unmastered tracks some months ago. I had already heard all but two of the albums songs live, and I heard that these tracks available for download where unmastered. Being a student of the audio field, I wanted to completely absorb the unmastered tracks, and compare them to the actual album. So, needless to say, I have had some time to take it all in. I hope people in the audio field can back me up; You can listen to Hail To The Thief over and over and find new sounds, and textures. There are seemingly dozens of very subtle layers of production. Nigel Godrich's engineering is brilliant.<br /><br />  My immediate impression, when I listened to the unmastered tracks, was that HTTT is a brilliant album. This had more to do with the music itself, which of course, wouldn't change come the official release. Aside from just sounding fantastic enough to give me emotional highs, Radiohead's actual music-writting skills have reached an all time high, in my opinion. Songs like 'The Gloaming' and 'I Will' are more melodic emphasized lullabies, while '2+2=5,' 'Go To Sleep,' and 'There There' among others, are brilliant sometimes edgy, always musical and witty rock songs. \\"Where I End And You Begin' perhaps my favorite track, is unlike anything I've heard. An odd, but powerful piece, fusing rock with dreamy electronic music, completely smothered in reverb and sonically building higher and higher until it's dreamy, euphoric climax.<br />  Finally, we have the meaning. What is this album about? While art is open to all kinds of interpretation, HTTT is heavily constructed with social/political commentary. Time Magazine put it brilliantly, \\" ... Thom Yorke, would just like the world to behave. His best songs (listed songs) are written from the perspective of a perfectly rational person who thinks the rest of the world has gone nuts.\\" The engineering, music, and lyrics al tie together to create the album's meaning and emotional atmosphere. In 'We Suck Young Blood' you can envision a vampiric corporate or political leader giving a speech to a small crowd of youths, who clap in unison very slowly, as if hypnotized to the song and this figures words, in a small, dark room. 'The Gloaming' has Mr. Yorke crying out to the world, \\"Your alarm bells, they should be ringing!\\" There are too many moments of greatness to list here, and too much to talk about. I'll just say that Hail To The Thief is a masterpiece, and possibly Radiohead's greatest album.has gone nuts.\\" The engineering, music, and lyrics al tie together to create the album's meaning and emotional atmosphere.

B000093BDX|4.0|This is a fun CD containing an excellent selection of classic Beach Boys tunes, albeit with a VERY disappointing mix of mono and stereo versions.<br />The selections, to my way of thinking, are top notch.  Nice to have this group all on the same CD, especially a great new stereo version of the original DANCE, DANCE, DANCE and a well-produced DO YOU WANNA DANCE, even if it is mono.  This is about as career-comprehensive as one can come for The Beach Boys on one CD.  Capitol did a good job in that respect.  <br />What galls me about this CD, and keeps me from giving it five stars, is the large number of mono tracks which are included.  Thirteen of the thirty tracks are mono and Capitol does not provide the consumer with that information on the outside packaging of the CD.  You need to buy it to find this out.<br />Why Capitol, why?  Why release yet another Beach Boys compilation, which could have been absolutely superb, which contains excellent new stereo versions of the some of these classics, while including so many mono versions?  Why not wait until most or all of these tracks were available in the terrific-sounding stereo versions?  To be fair, all tracks are well-produced, digital quality.  Nevertheless, I feel deceived.<br />So that you can make the informed decision that was denied me in purchasing this CD, following are the thirteen mono tracks: GOOD VIBRATIONS, DARLIN', SURFIN' SAFARI, I GET AROUND, FUN FUN FUN, DON'T WORRY BABY, HELP ME RHONDA (the good version, not the one included on &quot;Endless Summer&quot;), BE TRUE TO YOUR SCHOOL, WHEN I GROW UP, BARBARA ANN, DO YOU WANNA DANCE, DO IT AGAIN and WILD HONEY.  If I had known these tracks were mono, I may not have purchased this CD, but then again I may have just the same.  I just don't like to be deceived and intentionally misled.  At least now, you will not be.<br />Despite all, I can not end this on such a negative note because this is &quot;up&quot; music and there is one other good point about this collection.  Virtually all of the new stereo mixes are superb.  There are new or relatively new stereo mixes for CALIFORNIA GIRLS, SHUT DOWN, DANCE DANCE DANCE, HEROES &amp; VILLAINS, GOD ONLY KNOWS, SLOOP JOHN B and WOULDN'T IT BE NICE.  All are the original versions, but in updated, crystal-clear stereo.  The remaining songs are older stereo mixes that sound just fine.<br />All in all, I don't think you would regret purchasing this CD but at least now you know what I did not, and can decide for yourself if the mono versions matter to you or not.
B00003CXSP|5.0|In this Hannibal series, this, IMHO, is far and away the best of the group. Stylish, atmospheric and beautifully photographed, directed and scored. The music, especially, is haunting and absolutely perfect; after all, this is Grand Guignol at it's finest hour, thanks to the Master, Ridley Scott. Even the gore is done in an operatic fashion, and when the Abattoir takes center stage (which is rather often), you are still hypnotized and mesmerised by the spectacle, the story and the images. Nothing is gratuitous; nothing is done for shock value, but rather, as an integral; part of the story. Sir Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter, and his speech, his subtle nuances, and his asides (one favorite is his exceeding delight in the moment just preceding the demise of someone who crossed his path and shouldn't have...alas, too late.) Lecter is such a fascinating character that even his worst moments are beautifully choreographed and served up as a new and tantalizing dish, exquisitely prepared for your pleasure alone. Irresistable...yet he is a fiend. What a gorgeous paradox! Ray Liotta is great, especially toward the end, and Julianne Moore (again, IMHO) makes a superior Starling. I do not like comparisons, but with Moore you get more into the character of Starling, and are not distracted by thinking it's Jodie Foster playing a part. Mason Verger, another remarkable character, who has excellent reasons of his own to capture Lecter, lives in isolation on his estate (the famous Biltmore House, built by George Vanderbilt, ((still privately owned and lived in, can you imagine living in such a place! by the great great grandson...))in Ashevillle, SC, and also used for &quot;Being There.&quot;) except for the beleagured doctor who he demeans at every opportunity, poor Caudell; and assorted faceless servants. When I read the book I was skeptical about displaying such a human ruin onscreen; but the effects are nothing less than remarkable...Verger portrayed by one of my favorite actors.<br />THIS is what moviemaking is all about; this should be used as a template in film schools/studies; it is flawless, not one moment of drag...but the character who made me saddest of all is the poor, fallen-from-grace Police Investigator, Giancarlo Gianinni; he evokes tremendous sympathy, even with a wife who is exquisite beyond words, and still has a good job, but falls prey to his own greed...perhaps for the benefit of his beautiful wife. The opera scene, the music, the streets, transports you away from wherever you are, which, of coure, should be the goal of all films, but in this case, it succeeds beyond any expectations. Magic. Only watch this on DVD! Nothing less will suffice or bring you the production as it is meant to be seen, in all it's glory...fantastic.ors.<BR>THIS is what moviemaking is all about; this should be used as a template in film schools/studies; it is flawless, not one moment of drag...but the character who made me saddest of all is the poor, fallen-from-grace Police Investigator, Giancarlo Gianinni; he evokes tremendous sympathy, even with a wife who is exquisite beyond words, and still has a good job, but falls prey to his own greed...perhaps for the benefit of his beautiful wife.

B000092ZYX|5.0|one of radiohead's best.  an aural delight.  if you downloaded it before it's release, consider supporting the band and buying it if you like it.  it sounds wonderful compared to the unmixed/unmastered copy that most people downloaded.  buy this album!
B00008YLV2|3.0|While I think the movie is a great technical experience and one of the most stressful (in a good way) pictures I've ever sat through, I must say I was very disappointed in the sound on this special edition disc, which isn't right, since this won the Oscar for best sound editing.<br />First of all, it's a crime that there wasn't a DTS track on the disc with the feature, but the 5.1 mix just isn't up to snuff.  There was very little feeling of ambient sound and the mix was largely centered in the front speakers.  There are occasionally some sounds that zip by in the rear speakers, but I was not impressed, and thought the disc makers really glossed over something that I would vastly improve the experience of this film.<br />That being said, it's a great flick and I haven't had time to go through all the extras, but I'm looking forward to it, especially the Frontline documentary and the Ranger commentary.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Listening to this album, is like swimming bare naked in an electronic sea while the absolute paranoia of the world carreses you in its wake. Now i've never done that before but im guessing it'll be a bit like this record, and its a fantastic feeling. Thom Yorke may be stepped on by people for being, \\"pretencious\\" \\"cynical\\" even....whatever.  I can tell you track by track that this one song sounds good, what this other song incorporates, what that song sounds like. But i wont, just get this album, and listen to it in its entirety. For it has captured a dying civilizations struggle, post 911 post War, post election and every other tragedy to rebuild itself and made something beautiful in its melancholy.
B000092ZYX|5.0|HTTT starts off on a right note by listening to Thome's voice quietly in the opening seconds of 2+2=5 saying &quot;That's a nice way to start'', later in the song he says, you were at home, allowing yourself to believe the lies.  The CD is loaded with political messages as well as optimistic lines that leave you thinking about what the future will be like for Radiohead.  The 14 tracks, which contain several song-oriented tunes make is seem more like a classic Radiohead CD, but they still incorporate the synthesized sound captured in Kid A and Amnesiac. Overall, it's an excellent CD, with a variety of great tracks.  It ends with a great song, a creepy suspicious fantasy that captures the essence of Radiohead, and leaves you thinking that the best is yet to come.  I should only give it 4 stars because I think that O.K. Copmuter and The Bends are better, but in my (biased?) opinion all but Pablo Honey are 5 star albums.
B000002J09|5.0|This is an amazing album.  Every song is good from begining to end.  \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\" are excelent examples of rock.  \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is an amazing song even after the 700th time.  That goes to you music fan from portland.  \\"Battle of Evermore\\" and \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" are excelent songs.  \\"Going to California\\" is a great song with excelent lyrics.  Oh yeah, hey music fan from portland, i agree the Rolling Stones and The Who are great bands.  But aerosmith??? Give me a break.<br />LED ZEPPELIN RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|great album, several subtle changes, but overall Radiohead is the same
B000003CMC|5.0|What makes Eat a Peach so hip is that it blends the Allmans' blues-based jam band thing with 70s drug trip psychedelia, without either getting the way of the other.  The Allmans pull it off better than Zeppelin or Floyd or the Dead ever did.<br />Several tracks here come from the Fillmore shows and are straight-ahead blues.  Gregg's tunes make for the more psychedilic stuff here, but even they never get far from the blues and especially on Mountain Jam you hear them both together.<br />Since the Fillmore Concerts are an idealized virtual live show, Peach has got to be the best Allman Brothers album qua album.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I was shocked to find this DVD for only $14.99 (fourteen dollars and ninety-nine cents) at Target.  This DVD is very, very nice, and if you like the Matrix and/or good anime, this is a must-have.<br />There are plenty of good plot summaries out there, so read those if you want a synopsis of the DVD, but let me just say that I thought the \\"First Rennaisance Part I and II\\" were awesome and crucial to an understanding of The Matrix.  I was glued to the screen.  \\"Program\\" blew my mind, and is probably my favorite.  \\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" is beautiful and a little racy--great, nonetheless--and is mentioned in the Matrix:  Reloaded.  I thought that was pretty cool.  And \\"Kid's Story\\" is also essential to understanding one of the characters in Reloaded.  \\"Matriculated\\" was a little strange, but I highly enjoyed the other episodes.  My only complaint:  the DVD's just too short!
B0000025DD|4.0|Opinions: This solo effort by David Gilmour is great for his guitar skills and his voice.  It isn't weighed down by the darkness of those late 1970s that is characteristic of Pink Floyd's releases of the time.  One can even hear similar stylings from the Animals album such as a guitar effect from Dogs which is also in #4 here, or the ending to Sheep similar to the ending to #3 here.  But enough of digging for little details.  I have to say that I gave this 4 stars because of David Gilmour's words.  There isn't the depth one may expect coming off of Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here albums and I believe if there were any doubt as to the power of the words of Roger Waters, such doubts are extinguished here.  This does not sound like poetry and it seldom hits to the core of the listener.  So with words aside, this album is great.  The instrumentals (at least 3 here) give the impression that David Gilmour just couldn't wait to give a try at a solo album.  One can almost hear the new Pink Floyd (post The Final Cut) waiting to be born.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Pink Floyd of the early to mid 1970s until Roger Waters assisted in depressing the planet Earth with his father issues and overly morose lyrics.<br />Facts: Released in between Animals and The Wall, this album contains the song There's No Way Out of Here and as well as no Roger Waters credited songs.
B000002KCF|5.0|I first bought this album in vinyl back in 1977, along with <BR>&quot;Sleeping Gypsy&quot;. I was in college then, and me and all my friends were &quot;Franks Fanatics&quot;. These two were the albums you played to impress girls with your great taste in music. It was so radically different from what was out at that time. And the girls just loved it! It made all of us think we were so sophisticated, since we thought we were the only ones who were cool enough to like Michael Franks. Of course, over the years we've grown out of that mindset, but &quot;The Art of Tea&quot; always make me feel warm and fuzzy, with fond memories of my college days. Thank you Mr. Franks!
0452282152|3.0|The historical context is interesting as are the various roles of the characters - the author is particularly good at highlighting the subtleties of power and influence in the characters, however this is not maximised and the end result is a rather light read, without much depth to the story. A good read if you want something that's interesting without being too complex or taxing.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I was afraid, like many, that Radiohead was on their way for a fall.  I will tell you this was not the case.  This album is as rich and satisfying as to belie any Radiohead fan's concerns but accessible enough that anyone can pick it up and totally enjoy it.  I would never have thought a year ago that I would have been a Radiohead fan but today I'm diehard and this album only proves that no Radiohead devotion is unworthy.  From the sensually redone mixing of 2+2=5 to the pulsing pop of Myxomatosis, the vein is pure Radiohead but it has the almost sentimental lyrics of a far less talented-instrumentally-band.  The lyrics are great, the music is great. Radiohead has yet again outdone themselves-this is fantastic.
0780626478|4.0|But it's definitely lighthearted so it's hard for me to give it 5 stars.  <br />Christopher Walken is histerical.  But it's Fraser's innocence and genuine expressed joy that really makes the film watchable.  Not to mention that I always enjoy seeing him dance.  He's definitely got some go.  <br />Alicia Silverstone's character is pretty transparent but she gives a credible portrayal.<br />It just works.
B000006OAM|4.0|I was playing this CD and my boyfriend said \\"Is this chick dying?\\" I thought it was pretty funny.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There is nothing better and original in rock music ar the mo.Everything else is revival of garage,metal or punk rock.It has a feel of both Amnesiac and Ok Computer coz of electronica and guitars mixture..but there's much more.If you're a Pink Floyd fan think of early acid floyd(ummagumma) meet &quot;the wall&quot; or &quot;animals&quot; phase. Some people critics compared this album to the old King Crimson ..and I would actually agree to a point.They do  share the same courage to explore the possibilities of the new music which characterised the prog rock bands but there's allways a punk feel in it.If you're into predictable music you're not gonna like this one anyway.Strongly recommended
B00009P1O2|5.0|The guy above unfortunately is reviewing the Brazilian bootleg DVD.  The above ad is for THE REAL THING!!!  This is the Queen DVD I have been waiting for.  I too bought the Brazilian bootleg thinking it was just an import.  The 2 disc set above includes TONS more than the bootleg and it's CHEAPER!!!  Every Queen fan should own this DVD, but if you're not a Queen fan, THIS WILL TURN YOU INTO ONE!!!  This DVD will show you why Queen could entertain like no other!!!  All four members put on a show that literally made me jump out of my seat.  We definately lost a \\"one of a kind\\" guy when Freddie Mercury passed away.  I'm getting kind of long winded so I'll make one thing clear- BUY THIS DVD.  For more info about it, go to queenonline.com. It's the official Queen website.
0688163173|5.0|Shutter Island sits off the coast of Boston and is home to Ashcliffe Hospital for the criminally insane.  Teddy Daniels, U.S. Marshall, and his partner, Chuck Aule, arrive on the island to help in the search of a missing patient.  What actually goes on at Ashcliffe?  Unconventional psychiatric treatments?  It's difficult to review this book without giving too much away.  Several other reviewers have said they were unprepared for the shocking ending.  So I prepared myself by paying close attention to all the clues.  But it wasn't enough.  As I finished this book, sitting in a well air conditioned room, I actually broke out in a sweat.  That has never happened to me before.  What a stunner!  Some reviewers have said they thought Lehane's previous novel, Mystic River, was better.  I just can't imagine that.  So, I'll put Mystic River on my must-read list.  It's going to take me awhile to get over Shutter Island, though.
B000089RVX|3.0|Evanescence has a great sound and Amy is a beautiful singer. But her voice belongs best with piano pieces like Hello and My Immortal. The rock songs she sings, she sings well but her voice sounds the best when on haunting piano pieces.
B00005QW5X|5.0|A few nights after seeing \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch,\\" I happened to be reading the chapter on love in Andre Comte-Spoonville's \\"A Small Treatise on the Great Virtues,\\"  and discovered \\"Hedwig's\\" plot line.  Imagine my surprise.  It appears that Aristophanes' portion of \\"The Symposium\\" was lifted, almost lock, stock, and barrel for the brilliant song \\"Origin of Love,\\" that pretty much lays the groundwork for the whole movie.  More astounding is that the material is used to great effect, and does both Aristophanes and Plato quite well.  Throughout the movie Hedwig is looking for the other half to make himself whole, and it's a touching, sometimes shocking, always amusing search - and the music rocks.  What more can you ask for in an evening's entertainment?
6303471714|4.0|I have had this video for years, and it is still my favorite.  There are some exersizes that can hurt you if you do them wrong, but anyone who works out should know that your knees should never go past your toes, full sit-ups can hurt your back, etc.  It is very easy to substitute safe versions of each exersize.  It is a very effective video, and I am considerably more tone and fit.  Best of all, it is not boring or cheesy--which most videos are.
B00003CXI1|5.0|The year 1997 was the beginning of a literary phenomenon with the release of the first Harry Potter book entitled \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" (a.k.a. \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\") by J.K. Rowling.  Following the release of the fourth book in the series (\\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\") in 2000, Warner Brothers released the first Harry Potter film titled based upon the first book in 2001.  Directed by Chris Columbus, the film received a lot of assistance from J.K. Rowling herself and remained very true to the original book, but with several changes, artistic interpretation and editing.<br />The story is about an 11 year old boy named Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), who is an orphan being raised by his very unpleasant Uncle Vernon Dursley (Richard Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw).  Unknown to Harry, he has magical powers and occasionally (and unknowingly) makes things happen that greatly upset the Dursley's.  However, the Dursley's know that Harry has magical powers because Harry's deceased parents (James and Lily Potter, played briefly by Adrian Rawlins and Geraldine Somerville) were a wizard and a witch.  A very powerful wizard named Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) had left the infant Harry on the Dursley's doorstep following his parents' deaths.  The Dursley's own son, Dudley (Harry Melling), is the same age as Harry and treats Harry very badly.<br />Upon Harry's 11th birthday, he receives a letter: something that has never happened before.  The Dursley's won't let him open the letter and become very upset when they read it, but more letters begin to arrive for Harry.  In spite of Uncle Vernon's efforts, Harry finally gets to read the letter when Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane as the groundskeeper at the Hogwart's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry) bursts in to personally deliver Harry's letter, which is his invitation to attend Hogwarts.  Harry at first doesn't believe that he is a wizard, but agrees to leave with Hagrid and hislife is never the same again.  He learns about muggles, goblins, wizards, witches and magic.  He also gets to meet Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), Albus Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), Professor Quirrel (Ian Hart), the unpleasant Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and a host of other wizards, witches, ghosts and other creatures.<br />Watching this film and its sequel based upon the second book (\\"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\\") inspired me to start reading the Harry Potter books.  I was very impressed with the amount of detail in the book that did not make its way into the feature film and understood how much the film deviated from the original story.  One of the biggest differences is the amount of attention given to characters in the book that only had minor roles in the film including Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), the Weasley twins (James & Oliver Phelps) and Dudley Dursley.  Also, a few characters in the book don't appear in the feature film at all.  The other major difference between the story presented in the feature film and the book is changing of when things are said and done, which is understandable considering the length of the film.  (It took me about 8 hours to read the book as compared to watching the film, which is 2.5 hours long.)<br />Memorable scenes in the film include Harry under the Dursley's stairs, Hagrid's arrival at the lighthouse, Diagon Alley, the train station, Harry & Ron meeting Hermione, the boats, Harry's first class with Professor Snape, the Quidditch match, raising the feather, the mirror, the forest, Fluffy, the keys, and the ending scenes.  Overall, I rate \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to everyone.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Most of the songs on this CD were great for parties and other stuff. My favorite song is &quot;Hella Good&quot;, because it has a great beat to it. A &quot;Platinum Blonde Life&quot; is a great way to show that blondes aren't all that dumb. Well some are. like me. So you want to know if you should buy this CD? My answer is &quot;Yes&quot;. That is All, Buh-bye.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead is rockin' for the first time since 1997. The first track, \\"2+2=5\\" is the rockinest song I've heard in a hell of a long time. Between that and \\"A Wolf At the Door,\\" are twelve more delicious tracks. <BR>\\"Hail to the Thief\\": The sum of Radiohead's career wrapped into one difinitive album, like nothing they've ever created before and yet you can hear every album they've ever recorded in this one collection. Rather than sounding like one big experiement, such as \\"Kid A\\" and \\"OK Computer,\\" this is a mix of their best stuff.<BR>Oh yeah, and do Thom Yorke's vocals sound different? Perhaps a little more mature? Damn right. He's in his prime right about now and those deep murmers and wails have never been better. A most excellent vocalist with some of the best musicians in the world to back him up.<BR>I never expected to hear clapping on a Radiohead CD as part of the song; I figured that kind of accompaniment belonged on a song written in 1953 about a car. However, this effect is used on \\"We Suck Young Blood,\\" in way that makes one think of marching in a death camp. Without this effect, the song would not sound as moody and complete.<BR>The mix of electronic sounds with raw guitar riffs and percussion make for some of the most creative music I've ever heard.<BR>This album is now number one in my collection. I don't know how it could possibly have been made any better.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This CD is really great. I know many reviewers disagree but this is, in my opinion, one of her best CD's yet.

B000092ZYX|4.0|Its been publicized that this CD is supposed to return the band to the days of guitar-driven songwriting. However, it does no such thing. If you liked Kid A and Amnesiac, then you will like this CD also. Although,it does seem as though there is a more coherant collaboration on this release, its very much in the same vein as the previously mentioned albums. <br />I miss the days of OK Computer. WIll they ever release another CD that matches the genius of that masterpiece? I dont know. However, with Hail To The Theif, it seems those days are long gone. This is a good CD, but not a great one. Its very enjoyable for what it is, but it doesnt match up to the quality of The Bends or OK Computer.
B00005JMC6|5.0|I've not been moved to write a review here before but this movie is quite something. I've seen it twice and may go again. Wonderful, genuinely interesting story, great performances, especially by Keisha Castle-Hughes, and smart visual storytelling. Another person on this board mentioned \\"waterworks\\"-- boy, no kidding! Impossible to contain. Niki Coro has a gift for dealing with intense emotion in an honest way. This is a great movie.
B00008J4P5|1.0|When I first heard &quot;White Blood Cells,&quot; I really didn't care for it that much. I especially couldn't stand the lead single &quot;Fell In Love With A Girl.&quot; However, after hearing some of the other songs on the CD (&quot;Dead Leaves&quot; escpecially) the album grew on me and now I like it a lot. So, I desperately wanted to like &quot;Elephant.&quot; However, I was soon very dissapointed in this effort. The songs are almost painful to listen to. They sound as if elementary school kids got together in a garage and just started playing. I just don't get the &quot;hype&quot; surrounding this release. It is so overrated.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I found the 9 anime short stories to be very creative and well scripted.  This is not the Matrix.  These are stories in the periphery.  You do get to see the final flight of the Osiris but you also get to see where the Matrix goes awry in Kid's Story.<br />I think they are actually a bit more human than the movie.  They explain themes you don't otherwise get.  The animation and subject matter in the 'Second Renaissance' is simply brilliant.<br />If you like anime and you like the Matrix these are must sees.
B00005JLF5|5.0|DS9 was probably the least popular out of all the Star Trek series out there.  Most NextGens couldn't get into it, and it was too complex to fascinate the younger generation like the previous two series could.  However, if you were one of the few who ACTUALLY gave it a chance, you were rewarded with one of the best TV series ever.  It created a story ark so huge that it literally started with series opener and was not resolved until the series finale.  The interaction between characters is what really gave the show its flavor though.  If you can afford it, pick up at least the first season.  If the show isn't your cup of tea, then you ca forget about the rest of the seasons.  However, if you give it a chance, you could be drawn into the most fascinating Star Trek series of them all.
B00008I8IF|5.0|The Jayhawks new album RAINY DAY MUSIC is quite a surprise. Although I wasn't impressed with their past two albums, I felt it was a step down, I am highly impressed with this album. The harmonies are right on and the songs are addictive, and make me want to sing along. It's good to hear this music again. One of the catchiest songs is &quot;Come To The River&quot;, which has some killer instruments and a memorable chorus. Same goes for &quot;Tailspin&quot; and &quot;Eyes of Sarahjane&quot;. &quot;Stumbling Through The Dark&quot; is very profound and beautiful in its lyrics and form. &quot;All The Right Reasons&quot; is another pretty song that has great lyrics and harmonies. &quot;Angelyne&quot; is one of my favorites on the album, a really nice memorable melody and the chorus is very beautiful.<br />The limited edition version contains a bonus disc with some bonus tracks, that include &quot;Fools On Parade&quot;, &quot;Say Your Prayers&quot; (Demo), &quot;All The Right Reasons&quot; (Acoustic Version), &quot;Caught With A Smile On My Face&quot; (Demo), &quot;Tampa To Tulsa&quot; and &quot;Waiting For the Sun&quot; (Acoustic Version). This is must have for any fans!<br />This is truly some great music and I recommend it highly, fans will definately not be disapointed in RAINY DAY MUSIC.

B000092ZYX|5.0|Once I started listening, I couldn't stop. This album will even get new listeners hooked. From its slow progression into a jangling mix of guitar and strings in 2+2=5, to it's whining, creepy ballad in \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", this album has a range of different moods, all seemingly melancholy, sarcastic and powerfully defiant at the same time. In this day and age where young people want to listen to something hard, poignant and violently beautiful, Radiohead has got it.
B00005V1B1|5.0|Camel is one of my favorite groups and I have all of their albums. This one is my personal favorite and I can't recommend it highly enough. It is amazing how cool this album sounds when played really really loud!!!<BR> \\"The Snow Goose\\" is my second favorite by them but you should know in advance that it is more New-Agey than most of their other material.<BR>It's unfortunate that this band has never recieved any real recognition by the media bozos... They deserve so much better... But, everyone I know who has had the pleasure of their music has liked it!!!
B000089RVX|4.0|First of all, i absolutely disagree with the other reviewers this music has nothing to do with linkin park music, it is gothic-rock not metal. i give it 4 stars because the songs are<BR>almost all very good and the gitarre fits perfect to the melodic voice. my favorite song is my tourniquet and going under. i just heard the band live in germany and it was nice to see and hear.<BR>but for really good gothic-music i highly recommend check out<BR>LACUNA COIL, it is by far the best music in the goth-rock sector
B000093NLH|5.0|It has a great bonus CD. I wish it had shown the same special features as the Acoustica DVD, but it's still okay. I wanted to see the music video edits of the songs, but I still enjoyed the interview. I wish Klause was there too, and all the other people that was performing with the Scorpions on Acoustica. I liked the short part of the rehearsals throughout the VCD which contained a little rehearsal for The Zoo, When Love Kills Love, Dust in the Wind, and Life is too short. It's still a great album. I recommend this album if you are a true scorpions fan. You would still be able to hear some songs from other bands that the Scorpions covere such as Dust in the Wind from Kansas, Love of my Life from Queens, and Drive from the Cars.
B000069AUI|5.0|A Rush of Blood To the Head is one of the most meaningful albums I've ever heard. It's one those albums that you can listen to from beginning to end, because every song here is great. Chris Martin's singing is amazing, and he's one of the most talented musicians out there. Anybody who can play the piano, guitar, and sing deserves your attention. This is a solid buy, one of those true emotional albums that you don't see very often. My favorite songs on this disc include politik, the scientist, and Amsterdam, but everything here is a winner. The only thing that bugs me about this cd is the group's political agenda inside the cover, and how they list several websites to help their cause. Besides the fact, this is a classic.
B000089RVX|5.0|A great selection of music, in which track by track sends<BR>you through life's situations. I listened to this cd as<BR>I was traveling, and my personal favorite song is My Immortal, amoung other tracks. But that one took me by suprise, I never expected a voice like that from a band like this, definitly 2 thumbs up. Great musicians... and great music...
B000092ZYX|5.0|LEts just get one thing straight, this is NOT a return to roots album. Its all fresh stuff here, and what it mostly feels like is the Bends crashing head first into Kid A. People who are hoping for OK Computer 2 will be let down. The rest of us will be rejoicing.<br />This album is still very wierd. Lots of techno esque bleeps and bloops. And at least one song is completely electronic, al la Kid A. But this time, the minimalistic electronic noises of Kid A are now more in your face. Be prepared for some seriously dancable techno sounds. But saving this album from being a total techno wash is that there is alot of other stuff to keep it a rock album gone electronic, not vica versa. Some very cool guitar going on, somewhere in the mishmashed soundscape. And theres a lot of Piano, which fits quite nicely. <br />My one complaint is that Radiohead seems to be afraid to do anything long, which is kind of a downer, since Parinoid Android was 6 Minutes and completely steller. Some of these songs build build build, but have a quick climax that quickly fades. Sometimes your left there wanting more. Perhaps thats the artistic intent of the album... but I woulda liked more.<br />All in all a good purchase though. The special edition will be interesting to you if you want to take out the poster-map thing and hang it on your wall (like myself). Otherwise I recomend the other version for its jewlcase. The digipack has rather flimsy packaging.
6305508550|5.0|Mike Judge, mostly known as the creator of the innocently stupid Beavis & Butt-Head, conceived this surprise comedy masterpiece that has gained quite a following since it's initial release.  Ron Livingston stars as Peter; a man so stuck in his cubicle at his dead end job that he undergoes hypnosis and decides not to do anything at all.  As he puts it best later on in the film: \\"It's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care.\\"  When company downsizing starts, he surprisingly ends up getting promoted, but when his two friends are in line to be laid off, they hatch a scheme to skim funds from the company's accounts.  The film itself is laugh out loud hilarious from beginning to end, thanks to the great screen play and Judge's excellent direction.  The rest of the cast is perfect as well; including Jennifer Aniston as Peter's new girlfriend, Gary Cole as Peter's smarmy jerk boss, Diedrich Bader as Peter's hilarious mullett headed neighbor, and a scene stealing Stephen Root as Milton; the company's constantly pushed around and neglected mumbling employee whose trials and tribulations you'll bust a gut laughing at.  All in all, Office Space is hilarious and is a one of a kind comedy that oh so rarely comes along.
B00008G9JO|1.0|Have we &quot;read Robert Burns&quot;? (Someone wants to know.) I'm going to pull a volume of his stuff from my shelf, open it at random, and point....Egad! It's part of a poem called &quot;To a Mouse&quot;. This is purely a coincidence, I assure you. From my finger (the beginning of verse seven): <br />&quot;But mousie, thou art no lane/In proving foresight may be vain:/The best-laid plans o' mice an' men/Gang oft agley/An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain/For promised joy! <br />&quot;Still thou art blessed compared wi' me!/The present only toucheth thee:/But och! I backward cast my e'e/On prospects drear/An' forward, tho' I cannot see, I guess an' fear!&quot;<br />Not too shabby, eh? Okay, let's see: It's &quot;mousie&quot;, not &quot;brown mousie&quot;, &quot;foresight&quot;, not &quot;clear-eyed forewight&quot;, &quot;men&quot;, not &quot;savvy men&quot;, &quot;grief&quot;, not &quot;anguished grief&quot;, &quot;pain&quot;, not &quot;heavy pain&quot;, &quot;present&quot;, not &quot;fleeting present&quot;, &quot;e'e&quot;, not &quot;weary e'e&quot;, and so on. <br />These two verses are much more forcible (and just as &quot;bucolic&quot;) as any two of &quot;Heavy Horses&quot; (especially more than any two of &quot;Acres Wild&quot;). Is it fair to ask a rock lyricist to compete with the national poet of Scotland (even if he does hail from the sterner side of the Tweed)? No, but then *I* didn't inaugurate the competition.
6305971099|3.0|Picking up right after Halloween 4 left off, Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers finds our favorite psycho once again after his young niece.  Donald Pleasence is back (yet again) as Dr. Loomis and is his usually great self, but the rest of the cast is plain 'ol bland and boring, and in the end your rooting for Michael to hack and slash them all away.  Halloween 4 was at least a bit memorable thanks to it's surprise ending, but this installment just like the previous, is notably missing any of creator John Carpenter's stylistic creativity.  This installment also introduces us to the \\"mysterious\\" man in black whose identity would be revealed in the next (and undoubtadly one of the worst in the series) Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers.  All in all, Halloween 5 is hardly the worst in the long running slasher series, but your better off sticking with the original classic film.
0316666343|5.0|This book is just amazing! It takes you to another dimension. I cried, laughed and was just overcome with emotion.Susie Salmons innocence and love for family and friends will sweep you away. Read the book and decide for yourself, you will not regret it.
B000002KNI|4.0|Art Garfunkle has the voice of an angel.  He sings so high and so sweetly!  Together, he and Paul Simon could sound like a boys choir.  <br />Paul Simon has few peers as a songwriter.  His melodies are accessible, and the music is &quot;easy listening&quot; with its roots firmly in the '50s and '60s folk and rock.  Still, the music is timeless, and as relevant now as when it was written.   Mr. Simon's lyrics, could form the basis for a course in modern poetry.  They create a beautiful and complex picture, often depressing and dealing with timeless emotions of lonliness and ineffectuality of our attempts at communication with another human being.  For example, &quot;Tonight I'll sing my songs again -- play the game and pretend.  But all my words come back to me in shades of mediocrity, like emptiness in harmony, I need someone to comfort me.&quot;  <br />Technically, the musicianship is very good, although there are a few missteps.  The recording is very warm and natural, and very good for a live album from the early '80s.  Well worth the price of admission!

B00005QXDD|5.0|I know the cd has been out for a while now, but I felt the need to share just how awesome this album is. Tenacious D is that sort of funny that will make you laugh 'til your eyes water. Also, they are very talented as a rock band, and are a lot better than most bands that take themselves too seriously. Don't be mistaken, you won't regret buying this album, especially if you're a Jack Black fan...
B00007JVBI|4.0|Not quite album of the year, but very interesting indeed. What stands out most to me is her voice. It's rough, yet girly at the same time. Musically it is pretty simple. Probably good for a \\"Cat\\" nap, or headphones. There are a few upbeat songs, \\"Free\\" and \\"He war\\", but I wouldn't exactly say they rock. Most songs involve piano and acoustic guitar. The only comparisons that come to mind are Elliot Smith, or a mellow Juliana Hatfield. Some complain of the cardboard packaging. I found it in a plastic case. My current favorite is \\"Good Woman\\". She is pretty cute. Meow.
B000068IEU|3.0|when i saw it for the first time around a year or so ago, well, when i just bought it from a region 1 dvd store, i was expecting it to be pretty scary. ...but...after viewing the the film i thought it had a few select disturbing scenes but that's about it. i mean the disemboweling scene was very graphic but other than that not much else was scary about it. for a very short film the scary scenes were over before they began. the ending where the leader krug got hacked up by the chainsaw wielding revengeful father, it didn't show any gory parts of him being killed. the special features had more scary bits in it to be honest. IF you want a MORE disturbing movie, watch texas chainsaw  massacre for the billionth time, or THE EXORCIST, voted the scariest movie of all time. i did like the film, but it could've been a lot more scary and disturbing. mari's last name &quot;collingwood&quot; is of a football team called the &quot;COLLINGWOOD MAGPIES&quot; IN AUSTRALIA.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This is a great movie. One of the best movies in years. This movie is better then any other world war two movie made in the past. I own it on dvd. I would tell any body to buy it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|The disc opens with the urgent 2+2=5 which is taken directly out of 1984 the novel. Yorke gets anxious and screams \\"You have not been paying attention!\\" with thick guitars squalling behind it.<BR>Dropping right into sit down stand up as yorke portrays big brother singing innane orders. All and all this is defenitely there most political album rather than Kid A which used more metaphors. Hail to the thief (taken from the protestors signs when bush was sworn into office)is a direct statement. The music as usual is very sonic and matures with every release. This being there most ambitious with full rock and idm/experiemental songs. Do yourself a favor and listen to the words. The beautiful we suck young blood is brilliant. ...

014028009X|1.0|Readers MUST relate to the heroine in order to find this funny, which means: they must find one's weight; food, drink and tobacco intake; clothes; cellulite; wax jobs; and every little frivolous emotion to be absolutely fascinating.  I know that some women talk endlesssly about such issues, but no one I know wants to be within 50 miles of them.  Those looking for splendid humorous fiction from contemporary British novelists should read Nick Hornby, David Lodge, and those with ambition will be rewarded with Salman Rushdie's extraordinary prose and fantastic comic view. These authors feature fully developed characters immersed in real dilemmas and within a truly universal view of humanity.
B00005JLK0|2.0|Another movie that had a great story line ripped to shreds by predictable scenes and cliche-like story sequences. I am a horror movie buff, but the recent surge of so-called horror movies have left a lot to be desired. If you see this movie with the intention of expecting it to be a total B movie, then it might not be bad. To a certain extent, I expected it. I don't know if the intent was to make this movie scary or gory (I feel there is a difference between the two), but this was all gory.The opening scene with the cord is a bit much. I felt like saying out loud &quot;yeah, right.&quot; <BR> Why do they have to make these &quot;ghost&quot; movies into &quot;action&quot; movies? Is it what people want? I wanted to see a movie about ghosts.I wanted a little suspense. It's weird, because I did like some parts of this movie, but, by the end,  I felt like I had seen this story a hundred times.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I myself hate almost all anime i see, with 2 exeptions, cowboy beebop, and this. this is an incredible 90 minute thrillride. alot of it doesnt make sence but 5 bucks says it will in november. the second renissance parts I and II are so cool. its the world before the machines rose and how they took over. if you like the matrix buy this. if you thought it was okay. rent it.
B000092ZYY|4.0|Radiohead recorded this album in a more relaxed setting, and you can tell by the edge and spontaneity in the music.  Each album seems to combine and improve upon elements they've experimented with in the past.  There are true classics here, in particular \\"Sail To The Moon\\" and \\"There There,\\"  Yes the guitars are back, but so are arrangements that combine electronic and acoustic elements together in a way that only Nigel Godrich could conceive.  But what makes Radiohead stand out are their lyrics.  \\"I Will\\" is simultaneously touching and menacing, \\"Go To Sleep\\" is horrifying and open ended enough to make you create your own picture of what's happening, which is the most appealing aspect of Thom Yorke's visions.  Radiohead comments about living in an insane place better than any band out there.  I think many years from now critics will talk about the last few Radiohead releases in the same way they talk about David Bowie's \\"Berlin Trilogy.\\"<br />The special package is well designed.  The theme this time around is a map.  The packaging folds out to read like magnetic poetry on acid.<br />It's upsetting that bands don't approach their art with the creativity Radiohead regularly expresses.  Well done, boys.
B00006V9A0|5.0|You Know You're Right: 5/5. this is a verry sad song. it is ironicly touching. it will mean more then alot to people who love this band.<BR>About A Girl: 4/5. This is a good song. I myself prefer the MTV unplugged version a helluva lot more.<BR>Sliver: 4/5. a good song, i love the little bass line through it. it sounds pretty funky.<BR>Been a son: 3/5. why the hell is this on here?<BR>Smells like teen spirit: 3/5. there are some people who will want to kill me for that, but nirvana is my favorite band and this is my least favorite song by them, its not that it isnt good, the novelty just sorta wore off.<BR>Come as you are: 4/5. once again the novelty has worn off. i still like this song alot though.<BR>Lithium: 5/5. one of the best on the album, also one of the best off nevermind. up there with stuff like Love Buzz, Paper Cuts, School, Rape Me, Heart Shaped Box, and Territorial Pissings.<BR>In Bloom: 1/5. This song sounds way to pop-esque for me.<BR>Heart Shaped Box: 5/5. a wonderful song. if you havent heard it and if you have, didnt like it, screw you and fix yourself.<BR>Pennyroyal tea: 4/5. once again i prefer the unplugged version. but still a great song.<BR>Rape Me: 5/5. A blowback, just amazing... wow...<BR>Dumb: 4/5. A good song, but a little repetitive and gets old fast.<BR>Man who sold the world: 5/5. a classic. one of the best off the album.<BR>All Apologies: 5/5. It sounds so much better when they had pat with them.<br />Final words:<BR>They should have thrown on the meat puppets songs at the end, especially lake of fire because that was a hit (at least they play it on my radio station)
B000092ZYX|5.0|A car without wheels will never go anywhere but if you play any 'Radiohead' album in it, it'll hover above ground for a few seconds and then shoots out into space.  It'll let us stare down from a great height at the beauty of our blue planet.  At least for me it does.  Your sense of perspective rises above cloud and tall buildings when you finally allow yourself to be immersed deep into this new album: Hail to the thief!<br /> I am not going to get into a debate with myself on which album is better than which because that is like looking at your own kids and picking favorites...its impossible.   I can always go grab 'Ok Computer' and listen to it, as with the other albums.  <BR>To everyone out there: Listen without prejudice.   The sonic textures and the palette of hypnotic hues are all here wrapped up in a bundle of 'Pseudo-Drug Induced' state.  You'll grow a second conscience. You'll grow a second and third mind.  Not exactly schizophrenia, but something like having an angel and a devil on your shoulder.   Except, these two are friendly with each other.  <br /> HTTT opens up with a hammer that plays around your soft shelled egghead for a litle while before it goes into a fury assault by hammering speedy guitar lines into your head.  'Pay Attention!!!', if you start drifting off into cloud cuckoo lands.  This is an opener that drills you for 3 short minutes before it relaxes itself abruptly.    The ticking sound queing up the next wave starts up instantly.  This wave of beautiful piano-laced lullabye rhythm and clicking beat puts you into another world almost instantly.   <br />HTTT isn't an album with just a 1-2 combo hit...its a 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14 Combo hit
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is a good, good, good album. good. it is just so GOOD! First off 7 nation army, a cool rock song that even my parents like. then we have coolness with meg-tastic vocals on in the cold cold night... just go get this CD.
0395645662|4.0|The giver is a very good book. I like it alot the begining is very boreing but the in the middle it starts to grab your attion and you want to read on, even during my break time i would sit in my desk and read.But the end of the book is confuseing to some people  when you read this book you cant be closed minded you have to be able to picture things in your head your.  so i suggest you buy the book and start reading.
B000092ZYY|4.0|From the moment HTTT opened in its swirling confused melody in 2+2=5 I knew this was going to be one of their best albums yet.  I think that radiohead is a band unlike all others mainly because they are constantly evolving and changing.  Hail to the thief is a great record because they took the electronics and great lyrics from Kid A and tied it in with the mor pop oriented Ok computer. I suggest you buy this album.
B00005KFUN|5.0|Muse are quite simply an astonishing band. Accompanying Matt Bellamy's amazing vocal, lead guitarist and piano talents, there are Chris Wolstenholme's intricate bass riffs, and Dom Howard's reliable and steady percussion. The album itself is a mix of most different styles of music, ranging from the heavy and hard rock of &quot;Plug In Baby&quot; and &quot;Hyper Music&quot;, which are just so cool, to the frankly brilliant &quot;Darkshines&quot;, with its wicked start-off. &quot;Feeling Good is also a brilliant tune, with a peaceful start leading into the heavier sound that I now associate with Muse.  The only complaint I could possibly have about this album is that the lyrics are not particularly meaningful, but this does not matter because the music overules this. Overall, I class Muse as a sort of heavier version of Radiohead, but without all the depression that seems to plague their albums.
B000096I9G|5.0|The Cure \\"Trilogy\\" live in Berlin is an unprecedented document of one of the most prolific and critically acclaimed bands in the history of popular music.<br />\\"Trilogy\\" captures The Cure's performance of their landmark albums Pornography, Disintegration, and Bloodflowers, in their entirety. For those who are familiar with commercially-released Cure videos, \\"Trilogy\\" is comparably the epitome of The Cure's sheer genius. A brilliant light show, outstanding cinematography, and unparalleled sound quality effectively convey the melancholy and chaotic vision of Robert Smith as never before. The Cure's performance is alternately intense and subdued: Robert's vocals are consistently stunning, while subtle variations in musical arrangements breathe new life into familiar songs, rendering every performance superior to the album version while maintaining the essence of the original. Perry Bamonte's guitar work is particularly tasteful during the Bloodflowers set, while Simon Gallup's bass provides possibly the only semblance of cohesion during the near-schizophrenic Pornography set. Jason and Roger are once again acutely proficient at drums and keyboards, repsectively.<br />Highlights of the Pornography set include unbelievable renditions of \\"A Short Term Effect,\\" \\"The Figurehead,\\" and \\"Cold.\\" The Disintegration set is simply mind-blowing. Note the return of the original synth to \\"Pictures of You,\\" as well as haunting versions of \\"Last Dance\\" and \\"Distintegration.\\" <BR>\\"Fascination Street\\" and \\"Prayers for Rain\\" have never sounded better. Bloodflowers songs are even more concise and emotional than Dream Tour performances: standouts include \\"Watching Me Fall,\\" \\"The Last Day of Summer,\\" and a surprisingly improved \\"39.\\"<br />The inclusion of encore \\"The Kiss\\" is a wonderful asset to the set and a fitting end to the DVD. Even long-established Cure fans will be shocked by the intensity of \\"The Kiss;\\" I have heard many, many live versions and this one...WOW. Worth the price of theDVD for this performance alone. <br />The Cure \\"Trilogy\\" DVD is a phenomenal testament to art-in-progress. The performance is timeless and classic, yet strangely contemporary. This DVD is a mere facet of The Cure's extensive catalog of music and is representative of Robert Smith's most ethereal, introspective work...casual fans would benefit from becoming familiar with less-demanding albums before watching \\"Trilogy\\" from start to finish (Cure Show might be a good place to start as far as concert footage.) \\"Trilogy\\" is a brilliant, unparalleled perforance...The Cure are successful in making three inherently dark albums sound, well...a whole lot darker. 10 stars.
B00008PC2O|2.0|Of course I was interested hearing that they were going to be releasing a 1080p version of the movie.  And I wondered if it was going to be worth purchasing this version, considering the add'l 16 minutes of footage were included on the previous Ultimate Edition (albeit by way of an Easter Egg, as it were).  So of course, I purchased it.  I have not actually watched the whole thing yet, and I will explain why.  But first let me say that the picture and sound were phenomenal.  I do not have Dolby ES, but DTS, but it still sounded great.  The picture was not to be believed at how clear.  I do have progressive, albeit only 480p (not the 1080p touted by the DVD - are there really any 1080p TVs out there?  Mine does 1080i - did it make a difference?  Not sure, but it looked pretty awesome to me!)  <br />Anyway, the one 'flaw' with this edtition, and the reason I am even writing this, is this ... they chopped off the sides of the film!  I can't believe out of all of these reviews, that no one had mentioned this little shortcoming of this version. They clearly explain in the enclosed booklet that they took a 2.35:1 (wider) format and chopped it down to 1.85:1 to fit the standard widescreen TVs.  It sounds like they only did this so that the presentation would be clearly 1080(p) (not to make liars out of them? dunno).  Otherwise, as they explain, there would be black bars at the top/bottom that would take away precious viewing from the full 1080 lines of resolution. <BR> <BR>Well, (Hello?!) I don't know about you, but the major reason that I even purchase Widescreen versions of DVDs at all is to GET THE WHOLE PICTURE!  I WANT to see what's going on at the extreme periphery of the scenes.  I admit I did start watching this edition, and, after having read how they masacred the panarama, I wanted to see if I noticed anything.  Well, the first scene they show through the Terminator's eyes - y'know all the data stuff happening on the sides of the screen - he was sizing up the Biker Dude to see if he could fit into his clothing -  well, it was very clearly and obviously Chopped Off.  I shut the thing off and have been contemplating bringing it back to Media Play for a refund for the reason of False Advertising.  Although, now, reading in these pages, someone is saying there might be an additional Extended (by 2 mins) version of the film - although not sure since it appears this person was referring to a foreign version.  So I might give his Easter Egg a try - and he claims something about he 2.35:1 A/R.  We'll see.  <br />So I gave this a '2' rating, because as much as what you could see was pretty awesome in comparision with previous (or any) versions, resolution-wise, I was not happy with the 'widescreen pan &amp; scan' thing they pulled.
B00005NOOH|5.0|I'll be simple and brief: this superb documentary is nothing more than a must own for any and every person interested in the history of World War II. <br />Expertly written, painstakingly researched, dramatically narrated by Laurence Olivier (giving perhaps his finest performance), and, the greatest aspect- countless invaluable interviews from survivors and veterans. Besided the miles of riveting newsreel and battle footage, World At War captures living history by preserving the oral histories of men and women from all sides of the war. Russians, Japanese, British, German, Dutch, Jewish, French civilians, soldiers alike all share their harrowing personal experiences.<br />I've known several history instructors on both the high school and college campuses who have used this magnficent document as an effective basis for their World War II curriculm.<br />I cannot be too effusive in praising this documentary. Hard hitting and throughouly entertaining this excellent series of DVD's is well worth every red cent.
B00008LDPU|5.0|I really, really enjoyed the Animatrix.  I am both a fan of anime and a fan of the Matrix and its sequel but I really think you need not be either to appreciate this package.<BR>The films obviously owe a debt to the storytelling devices and concepts that have been coming our of anime for years from Ghost in the Shell on, equally the films rely heavily on a video game inspired sensibility so it is my understanding that the directors put in equal time and energy to ancillary packages of anime as well as video games, that support and tie in with the films as well as stand alone as significant entries in their own genres. <BR>I don't have a Playstation, so i can't vouch for the video game, but I've read some of the reviews for the Animatrix and I think people are missing the point.  I don't think it's meant to be the Matrix Reloaded broken down and reformatted, nor are the stories meant to be direct support structures to the film.<BR>The Animatrix (as we have been told) is a collection of nine shorts which are basically riffs on the premise that the Matrix puts forward.  Some are more straightforward (a second renaissance parts 1 &amp; 2, for example, supplies a dispassionate history of the machine persecution and revolt that ultimately led to the supplication of humans as the dominant life form of the planet.  The art  is clean and the machines are reminiscent of what you may have seen in &quot;Metropolis&quot;.  Although, ostensibly supplying background information that fills in the blanks that movie did not have time to elaborate on, to consider it just a primer for the movie sells it short.  It is beautifully animated and moving, specifically scenes of machine torture, riot and images of violence that deliberately recall some of the more disturbing images of this century.  Both sides of the conflict are reflected in an objective and honest (if sometimes harsh) light.  Perhaps it is because of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end of the second world war,but Japanese animation in particular seems to have an eerie conscience in regards to rubble strewn devastation and bombed out cities and their aftermath and this has been the sharpest contrast when you compare their films on these subjects (Grave of the Fireflies, for example, or Jin-Roh) to our own.  There is a sense of conscience, grief and a tendecy not towards valor, but rather towards regret and responsibility that infuses the storytelling in this short in particular beyond just being background filler.<BR>Other shorts take aspects not presented in the film but suggested by it and develop them.  In 'Matri(x)culated'  a team of humans capture machines and re-program them (with hallucinatory, almost religious imagery ) to aid in the conflcit aganst their own kind.  'Beyond' (my personal fav'rite) explores the idea of a glitch in the matrix which evidences itself as a series of localised , bizarre phenomenon which a bunch of neighborhood kids believe to be a haunted house.<br />You don't even need to have particularily liked the matrix or its follow up to enjoy these shorts.  What you have is a collection of shorts  by some of the most impressive animators currently working, commisioned with a large budget and creative freedom and the result is pretty spectacular.  The animation is some of the best I've seen, &quot;Program&quot; picks up with the moody atmospheres that dominated &quot;Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust&quot;.  &quot;A  Detective Story&quot; uses a monochromatic style that looks partially like watercolor washes, partially like newspaper photographs, and partially like sepia toned photographs to create a visual style that compliments both the noir-ish aspects of the film as well as it's techno driven frenzy.  &quot;Matri(x)culation&quot; has a sequence of beautiful if cypherish images that are dreamlike and hypnotic, sort of like one of those &quot;beyond the mind's eye&quot; videos used to illustrate a symbolic allegory.  Some of the shorts are slightly more stylised (&quot;kids story&quot; and &quot;World Record&quot;) and &quot;Flight of the Osiris&quot;  is the hyper-realistic CGI work that you may have seen in &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;.   Each story is well told and slight, more like a tone poem, which suits the idea of being a collection, each one relating to the story that came before it and to the one that will follow it, supported by,  but not dependent on the greater story arc.<br />If you have seen or appreciated any fine animated films like Spirited Away, Metropolis, Ghost in the Shell, Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust, Jin-Roh, or of course, Akira, then there is something here for you to enjoy.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This is the kind of thing I crave.  Whenever I consume a good movie, book, or CD; I always want more.  Although not religious about THE MATRIX series, I did enjoy the first film (great DVD!) and have yet to see RELOADED.  Having something as cool as THE ANIMATRIX come out directly on DVD was a stroke of genius.  The nine animated shorts on this disc are all exceptional, some more than others of course.  A visual cornicopia of different animated styles, the feature is not only for MATRIX fans but for sci-fi and art fans as well.  You need not be labled a geek for procuring this item for it stands on its own as a cool little collage of smart ideas based on the MATRIX mythos.  I sometimes find myself looking for a DVD that I can pop in and enjoy some cool visuals and soundscapes for fifteen minutes, this is that DVD.  Worth it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I am writing this review way before i have even heard the album.<BR>They are my favourite band, who cares!<br />Go buy the original it's mastered unlike the one s you download off the net, those aren't even mixed.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Theres nothing groundbreaking here. Too dark? Could have been alot darker if you ask me. What the heck happened to Bullseye? Why does he now look like the character from The Last Action Hero? Certain things just shouldnt be messed with. This just doesnt come close to spiderman and no where near the first Batman. Cant wait for the Hulk, that should be a good laughable cartoon.
B000002B1M|5.0|On this he had the best lyrics of all time on this album I love this I play this everyday it was written is the Greatest.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I am a big radiohead fan, and have been looking forward to this album for a long while. It does not dissapoint. Like Kid A and Amnesiac, it is not very listener friendly, and takes repeated listenings to fully apreciate. This album is haunting, the melodys burrow under your skin hitting all the right spots. get it.
B00005JLEX|5.0|This is absolutly the best show in the world. Friends is close, but thankfully I heard on TV Guide that Seinfeld is being made on DVD as we speak. Jerry Seinfeld says it will include interviews with the cast and outtakes. The release date is currently unavailable.<BR>SO BE PATIENT, AND START SAVING UP!

0385486804|5.0|Into the Wild is one of the best works of recent nonfiction, a work of true drama and mystery, and an attempt to answer the question \\"What would cause and very intelligent and adventurous young man to die in the wilderness of Alaska?\\"  I sat spellbound as I read through Krakauer's book and all the time feeling as if I was with Chris on his journey across America and into Alaska.  I highly reccommend this book.
B00004VWA7|5.0|Jaco Pastorius is without doubt one of the best(if not the best) bass players who ever lived.Once you start listening you're hooked!Every song is unique and somewhat intense and mellow at the same time.As a bass player myself,I believe if are in need inspiration Jaco is the man to listen to.<BR>Buy this album,you will not regret it!
B00004XPOZ|5.0|'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away'.<br />I was 14 when I first saw this now-famous opening 'card' to what was then just Star Wars.  It had not yet been given an Episode number or a subtitle.  It was simply Star Wars back in the summer of 1977, and George Lucas was not sure - and neither was 20th Century Fox - whether his dream of a six-chapter Skywalker/Star Wars saga would be realized.  After all, this mixture of space adventure, Western, war movie, and old-fashioned mythology was, according to some studio executives, a souped-up comic book story with no chance of making money.<br />Yet, the adventures of farmboy-turned-into-hero Luke Skywalker somehow defied the logic of skeptics and fuddy duddy critics, and Star Wars went on to make movie history (and billions in ticket sales and licensed products).  Lucas went on to write the next two films' stories and screenplays (with the creative talents of the late Leigh Brackett and writer-director Lawrence Kasdan to assist), and with the success of Star Wars (which by 1981 would be renamed as Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope) to build up Lucasfilm Limited (LFL) into a huge multi-media empire.  And even though it would be almost two decades before the prequels could be made and released, the Star Wars Trilogy's completion in 1983 laid the groundwork for the creation of Episodes One, Two, and Three.<br />This boxed set of the Star Wars Trilogy consists of the 1997 Special Edition films.  These were released to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Star Wars, which was a good promotional tool for LFL to build up fan enthusiasm for the still-in-production Episode I.  The Special Edition re-release featured not only a restored print of the film, but also some deleted scenes (mostly with Jabba the Hutt) were incorporated into Star Wars: A New Hope.  Mos Eisley was practically reinvented digitally, and some scenes were tweaked digitally, pleasing some fans while annoying others.  The other two Episodes (The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi) were given less drastic retouches' or at least there were fewer gripes about the changes there.<br />Of course, none of the elements that made the Classic Trilogy such a big part of our lives is missing in this Special Edition.  Luke's earnest quest to be a Jedi, Leia's resolution to restore the democratic Republic, the droids' Laurel-and-Hardy friendship, Han's casual courage, Chewie's fierce loyalty, Obi-Wan's quiet nobility, Yoda's quirky teachings, Palpatine's unremitting evil, and Darth Vader's dark power are all there, just as we aging teenagers of the Star Wars Generation remember them.  Industrial Light & Magic's then-visionary effects have been cleaned up (there are none of those unsightly mattes that are evident in home video transfers), and John Williams' classic score still sounds fresh and timeless.<br />The Star Wars Trilogy - at least this is my impression - is the movie series that has been most shamelessly re-released and re-packaged since the advent of videotape.  Since 1992 four boxed sets (original, THX, 1997 Limited Edition, and 2000 re-release) have been launched like so many probe droids.  This latest video release has the fewest extra features of the last three - the 1992 boxed set has no extra features.  While the THX version from 1995 opens each film with a short intro by George Lucas and Leonard Maltin, and the 1997 limited release comes with explanations of how and why the films were altered and/or restored, the 2000 boxed set only has a short promotional featurette about Episode II.<br />This boxed set comes in an easy to find pan and scan (full screen) format and a harder-to-find Widescreen version.  Until the DVD set comes out sometime in 2005, this boxed set is the best way to enjoy the original Star Wars films.Back and Return of the Jedi) were given less drastic retouches' or at least there were fewer gripes about the changes there.<br />Of course, none of the elements that made the Classic Trilogy such a big part of our lives is missing in this Special Edition.

B00004VWA7|5.0|Jaco Pastorius is without a doubt one of the greatest(if not the greatest) bassist who has ever lived.The things that he can play are just absolutely amazing.I also think this is a great album beacause every song is unique.It can be intense but also really mellow.As a bass player myself I can say if you are looking for inspriation,Jaco is the man to listen too.Great stuff!<BR>Buy it,you won't regret it!
B00000J6AG|1.0|I honestly fear for mankind after hearing this album. Even more so, I worry about everyone who loves it so much. If you're finding absolutely anything about this album to be inspiring, exceptional, unique, or even GOOD in the slightest (with one exception, which I'll get to later), you obviously haven't heard nearly enough REAL music, and obviously have been inducted into the Mindless Drones With Money to Burn Hall of Fame.<br />Moby's formula is to take a sample, loop it, and add drums. He does this over and over again. There are no exceptions. For some reason, people find this \\"deep\\".<br /> Some tracks are \\"ambient\\"--otherwise known as \\"narcoleptic\\". When a song absolutely DOES NOT CHANGE for four minutes--and what's there to begin with is hardly exciting--it's left the realm of true ambient music and gone into sleep-inducing, terrifyingly bad hype.<br />As for the \\"deeper meaning\\" behind this obvious attempt to [put] out yet another commercialized sellout record (not like he had any talent whatsoever to begin to sell out with), simply put--there is none! Where are people finding meaning and substance in \\"why does my heart feel so bad\\" repeated over and over for 3 minutes? Where is the purpose and direction in \\"gunnahunnagumbay\\"?<br />The lone exception to this rule is the exceptional song \\"everloving\\"--download that and enjoy, because if you're looking for that kind of music, you'll most likely hate the rest of the album.<br />If you want to listen to real music that actually has substance unlike this amateur [stuff], listen to Delerium's album Karma... Enigma's Screen Behind the Mirror.... Amethystium's Aphelion.... Sorten Muld's III....<br />There is so much good music out there--don't waste your time on this one.
B00008PX8P|5.0|All young people today should see this DVD to see what a <BR>REAL rock band is all about.  People like myself who grew up in the 70's were exposed to quite a few talented bands, Zep, Floyd,<BR>Queen, Genesis, Yes, etc.  Nowadays the garbage I hear today has musicians(I use the term loosely)who are lucky if they can play 5 chords.  As a matter of fact comparing Zeppelin to any band around now talent-wise is like comparing Einstein to the village idiot.  There simply is no comparison.  The quality on this DVD, sonically and visually is superb and even better than The Song Remains the Same footage because there are no silly fantasy bits.  Page produced this just like he's produced all Zeppelin material and as usual did a great job.  A welcome blessing to Zeppelin fans everywhere.
B000092ZYX|5.0|THis cd just reafirms why it is that radiohead is the most important band in all music today. truely this cd is the &quot;right of spring&quot; of the 21st century
B000092ZYX|4.0|Like their last two albums, the music on this release simply cannot sink in the first time or two you hear the record.  I don't like to pinpoint where an album falls in relations to other recordings by an artist, but I feel this album progresses logically from where Kid A and Amnesiac left off in developing the band's sound.  Hail to the Thief feels like a quiet, introspective album, but on repeat listens you start to notice a kind of tension beneath the surface, brewing violence waiting to break out from underneath the quiet lilt of a number of haunting melodies.  It's an unsettling album in a lot of ways--but it still has the quintessential Radiohead rock-out moments and, of course, some of the most inventive sounds you'll hear a modern band produce these days.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I have been a radiohead fan since the first time i herd the albulm ok computer. Now 3 years, 6 cd's, and one concert ticket has reminded me the epic proportions of radiohead phenominal talent. I have never felt before how radiohead makes me feel... Its like you are floating in space with the whole universe surrounding you and your the only one there, such a sence of comfort yet vulnerability at the same time. These feeling which were so prevelent on Amnesiac still occur on HAil to the Thief but unlike KID A and Amnesiac This marks a return to the world of Rock n roLL.  the first time i herd these songs were at Field day and radiohead was simply god-like. the only thing which i am going ot say is you may not like this cd the first time you hear it if you are not a fan... but i guarrente that if u give it a chance it will blow your mind. buy it... its all i have to say
B000092ZYX|4.0|As a Radiohead addict, I downloaded this cd several weeks before it came out, but I also got up at 4 in the morning on June 10th to buy the cd. Its well worth it and a great addition to the Radiohead collection, but its not as electronic-driven as Kid A or OK Computer (which I recommend to anyone just getting in to Radiohead). While it is better than Amnesiac (what wasn't) or Pablo Honey, Its not another legend in the making. One quick comparison: (and not just because theyre Brits), but Radiohead's sucess is much like that of the Beatles. They peaked, and they continue to put out good stuff, but they'll never measure past their greatest accomplishment (Kid A, or the Beatle's Sgt.Pepper's), but everything is still smooth sailing.
B000092ZYY|5.0|more along the style of kid a.  i like it alot and you should buy it. trust me. if you dont get it i feel sorry for you.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I love Tatu!!  I first saw their video and thought how refreshing to see something so beautiful.  Then I saw them on the movie awards and couldn't believe how amazing their performance.  I love this CD as it is a work of art.  Definitely the best album to come out in the past few years.
B00008RH3L|5.0|I don't often review works on Amazon, but I felt the itch to plug one of my favorite movies now that it has finally been released on DVD.  Other reviewers have done a great job of outlining the plot, so I'll keep my comments to just 2 points.  <br />First, the casting in this movie is just fantastic: Gabriel Byrne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro, Albert Finney, Jon Polito... My vote for the best performance in this film, however, would go to J.E. Freeman as \\"The Dane\\" - the Grim Reaper couldn't possibly get a better portrayer.<br />The second observation is that Miller's Crossing is not just one of the funniest movies ever (\\"are you done talkin'... or maybe you still got too many teeth in your head\\"), but also one of the most heartbreaking.  How the Coen Bros. managed to do both is a mystery that I still haven't solved 13 years after I first saw this film in the theater.  It's an absolutely indispensible movie.
630521610X|1.0|This ain't one of them. Simply laughable. If you got scared in this, you are a whimp.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I was a 'hard rockin' teen back in the late seventies...I was a drummer playing in garage band after garage band...laying down tracks to Zep, Purple, Hendrix, Aerosmith, etc.  Of all the great music I was listening to and (vainly) attempting to immitate, it was none other than Led Zeppelin that stole my heart.  As you may or may not know, the reason people LOVE music is because it stirs EMOTION within themselves...it \\"lights up\\" their soul.  And obviously, for me, it was Zep that did the trick.  On some occasions I found myself hypnotized listening to Page tell a story with his guitar, while other times I was destroying furniture...pounding out beats on anything that crossed my path as I listened to the groove and passionate fury that Bonham unleashed on his kit.  Zeppelin gave me in musical bliss what heroin gives a junkie!<br />The irony of this whole story is that I haven't listened to Zeppelin in nearly 25 years.  From the late seventies through early eighties, I had Zeppelined myself to death...burned out beyond burnability.  Done. <br />But here I am...twenty some-odd years later.  I purchased it, I played it, I played it, I played it, I played it....<br />Some people like Tony Bennett...not my taste, but I most certainly respect their love of music.  If you happen to like 'heavy metal', a.k.a 'hard rock', it doesn't matter if you're an old Zep fan or a new one:<br />1)  Buy this CD<BR>2)  Spend the rest of your life trying to find something better<BR>3)  Die before you find it!
B00008PC2O|4.0|I have the the Ultimate Edition also and I purchase the Extreme Edition primary because of Windows Media 9 high definetion.  Also has full contementary by James Cameron. Video is far better than Ultimated.  And the Media 9 looks really good - especially on a friends projects.<br />That was the good new, here is bad news...<br />Audio.. by leaps and bounds, the Ultimate Edition is far better audio than this version.  I have a Harmon Karmon 525 7.1 sound system and i was extremely disapointed that this version has no DTS. <br />If you have a 7.1 systems, the experience of DTS ES 6.1 is unbelievable.  T2 is older movie, so DTS ES Descreet 6.1 may not be possible. But I personally will repurchase a DVD I already own if it had DTS ES 6.1 tracks on it.  I watch Blade II last not on my system and it rock my house.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I can't put into words how wonderful this movie is! Its so awesome! People who say that the acting & singing was horrible must have seen a ToTaLlY different movie. The casting was awesome! Catherine Zeta Jones was beyond aWeSoMe! Queen Latifah was hilarious! Renee Zellweger shone. And Richard Gere was good too. I saw a preview of this when I saw Sweet Home Alabama and I really wanted to see it. Alot of people compare it to Moulin Rouge and are saying that Moulin Rouge is better and I totally disagree. The only thing Moulin Rouge & Chicago have in common is that they are both musicals. I mean Moulin Rouge is a romance & Chicago has like no romance in it. So disregaurd people's comments about Moulin Rouge being better. I can't wait until this DVD comes out because the special features sound like they will be fun to watch! I've heard that there is another song thats in the deleted sung by Velma! In my opinion Catherine Zeta Jones totally out does herself & out shines Renee Zellweger. I just cant put what I feel about this movie into words.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|For all you Sum 41, Jimmy Eat World, 311, Linkin Park, etc. fans Relationship of Command is not for you. It's too raw, too loud, too energetic, too melodic for you &quot;Mainstream Fans&quot; to handle. This band is for true Rock fans who have real taste in music when it comes to Rock. At the Drive-In resurrected garage Rock that has been faint for the last decade. Since this album has come out I have noticed more Garage bands have been emerging to the likes of The Strokes, The Hives, The Vines, The White Stripes and all those other &quot;The&quot; bands. Their break-up is a tragedy but, in the ashes you will find something left in THE MARS VOLTA, not Sparta. This album is a must in a collection of true Rock fans. Blink 182 fans stay away from this album for your own safety.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Amazing sounds and rhythms.  this magnificant 5 do it again.  Their beautiful melodies and layering meshes beauty with absurdity.  Give it some time to sink in...and enjoy.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Anyone saying this is the next OK Computer in terms of style is only half right. It's not quite like OK Computer, nor Kid A, no Amnesiac as has also been said. Like all of Radiohead's albums, it introduces a new sound. In regards to listenability, it is probably most akin to Kid A or possibly Amnesiac - hard to listen to at first, but becomes easier after each listen, and better.<BR>2 + 2 = 5 gets the album off to a good start, with it's haunting progression and lyrics building to heavier rock for the second half. It also contains some of the darkest, paranoid, and most definitely funnest lyrics to both read and sing along to on the album. Sit Down Stand Up follows a similar soft, haunting structure, this time piano backed up by soft bells and sound effects, the texture thickening for the conclusion. It's threatening lyrics are also amongst my favourites, in terms of content mainly rather than delivery. Sail to the Moon is likely to be the most popular track with the more 'uninitiated' Radiohead fans out there, as it is one of the more accessible songs on the album, soothing and with a soft yet catchy guitar melody, and comparably 'nice' lyrics. Backdrift defines itself immediately with it's rhythmic, staccato synth-woodwind-sounds bouncing from ear to ear, which continues unchanged throughout the rest of the song, soon joined by lyrics and drums and and a truckload of synth, yet manages to feel constant in it's thin, windy texture. Go To Sleep is probably the most guitar-oriented song on the album, with an acoustic country-reminiscient chord progression being joined by electric guitar which later on is slightly reminiscient of Radiohead's earlier song 'Just', and repeated lyrical responses delivered very well. Where I End And You Begin sounds like the theme to a horror/sci fi flick mixed with early 90's rock and can imagine hearing it going in clubs, people jumping all over the plac (and hopefully not ignoring the thoughtful lyrics). We Suck Young Blood comes nextwith slow, slightly-evil sounding piano and hand claps making the now-irked listener feel like they're in some kind of of cult ritual in a twisted horror movie, the depressing, trapped lyrics assisting. Then The Gloaming comes along in drum&bass style with static flying all around and later bouncing, irregular square waves getting things freaky. The simple lyrics deliver what may be considered the overall message of the album (especially since The Gloaming is the alternative title to Hail to the Thief quoted in the included booklet) Then things jump back to There There, a great track also likely to popular, due to it's steady, catching beat and little in terms of paranoia-inducing effects, the last part of it's lyrics also giving a message clearer than that put forward by most of the other tracks. Then there is I Will, which offers a short, soft, electric ballad with nice minor vocal harmonies, the depressing lyrics holding with it well. A Punchup at a Wedding is the closest thing to funk found on Hail to the Thief, a slow, piano-based semi-funk that is nice and tight and catchy. Myxomotosis might sound closer to what is classed as 'standard rock' these days, if it weren't for the flickering, dirty saw waves and tense, high pitched chords which keep you jumpy and paranoid until the very end, the lyrics also being amongst the best on the album. No tricks with Scatterbrain, just soft, straight, nice rock, with the mastering of the guitar and the rest slightly reminiscient of 'Knives Out' and 'Dollars and Cents' from Amnesiac. Finally, A Wolf At The Door finishes in a similar epic way as Radiohead's other albums, with Thom singing in a style rarely heard from him, certainly shouldn't be missed.<BR>Anyway, Hail to the Thief is in some ways, more structured and unified than either of the last two albums (Kid A and Amnesiac), as well as more Rock-inspired. However, this does not automatically make it an OK Computer clone either - it continues Radiohead's trend of each album experimenting in new and different directions. It is a little hard to get right into, though not as much as Kid A.. but like any Radiohead album, it takes more than one listen to fully appreciate it for the brilliant work it is, and this album certainly doesn't disappoint.
B00005JM1F|3.0|A movie like \\"Old School\\" should know better than to mess around with a serious plot.  Most college gross-out comedies like this one don't.  Even \\"Animal House\\", the Gold Standard of college comedies knew enough just to have a plot that led to various gags, concluding with the incredibly funny final act.  All that was just so the guys could mess around.  For the first 2/3rds of \\"Old School\\", the movie knows enough than to take it's plot too seriously.  And for those 60 minutes, it's low comedy at it's best.<br />The basic plot outline is that Mitch(Luke Wilson) has just broken up with his long time girlfriend when he discovers that well, she's been cheating on him.  Big time.  Anyway, he gets a new house on the outskirts of a college campus, and his friend Beanie(Vince Vaugn, laying on the smarm), who feels trapped in his marriage and REALLY misses college, convinces him to form a frat to allow Mitch to keep his house, which the vengeful college dean(Jeremy Piven, painfully unfunny for the first time ever) wants taken over by the school.  Mitch relents in the face of the needs of his friends, especially Frank\\"The Tank\\"(played by Will Ferell in a star-making performance), who just got married but has quickly gotten seperated because he a booze hav a special relationship that some might call addictive, but which Frank considers necessary.<br />Anyway, the start the Frat, with a rogues gallery of pledges, some of whom are not students, such as \\"Blue\\", played by Patrick Crenshaw, who is just barely outshone by Farell for comic brilliance.  The movie moves from one set of gags to another, mostly howlers that will have you in stitches.  Then, the movie simply stops being that funny.  The plot takes over, and instead of simply being a vessel for more jokes, it takes over completely, with the gags becoming fewer, and the ending being really, really unsatisfying.<br />This was the same problem Writer/Director Todd Phillips had with his first mostly funny film, \\"Road Trip\\".  There, just towards the end, too much plot takes over, and the ending feels rushed, just like it does in \\"Old School\\".  While the last frames are funny, the big 20 minute hole in which the plot takes precedence over the jokes hurts the overall ranking for the film.  Also, Phillips can't write women well, and it shows in the opening scene and in Luke Wilson's sort of romance with Ellen Pompano's character.  It's just very weak.<br />The DVD itself, however, does have some great stuff.  The unrated edition has more risque, nasty stuff if you're into that sort of thing(heh), and the disc also has a hilarious bit in which Will Ferell reprises his interpretation of \\"Inside the Actor's Studio\\" host James Lipton in which he showers the film and actors with praise better suited for a Royal Shakespere Company production of Hamlet.  There are also deleted scenes that are pretty clever.  There is one thing Phillips has been consistantly good at: picking music for the soudtrack.  \\"Old School\\", just as \\"Road Trip\\", has the perfect song selection for it's best scenec(I've never seen Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" used more effectively).  Anyway, Phillips is developing as a comedy writer and director, and is prepping a sequel to \\"Old School\\" with the original cast.  Hopefully, he'll throw most of the plot out the window and let the cast work it's magic.There, just towards the end, too much plot takes over, and the ending feels rushed, just like it does in \\"Old School\\".

6304696566|4.0|Given the stature of this film, one would expect a better quality DVD.  I can only hope that one will soon be made available.  This is perhaps the greatest Western of all time.  Wayne turns in his most compelling performance as the lone wolf, Ethan, forced to confront an old Indian nemesis, Scar.  Ford sets Wayne against the backdrop of Monument Valley, as Ethan tracks down a teenage girl (Natalie Wood) who had been abducted by Scar.  The film can be a little uneven but it tells a very intriguing story.  Ford confronts racism and feelings of isolation, steering away for the most part from cliche images of the West.  Edward Buscombe has written a fine piece on &quot;The Searchers&quot; for BFI Film Classics which is well worth reading as it fills you in on the making of film, offering notes on Ford's epic vision.
0694003611|5.0|My older children loved this book so much that the first copy is worn out and I had to buy a second copy for my third child.  Easy to memorize text and few words per page make it fun and easy to read to kids.
B000000OTY|4.0|Two words.....LOVED IT!!  I was never a Peter Gabriel fan until I saw Secret World Live on TV.  Until I watched it and heard the music, I had only heard two of Peter Gabriel's songs (Sledgehammer and Steam).  And I never knew that he sang the theme song from the movie The Bone Collector, also (Don't Give Up).  I simply could not believe the sensuality and the \\"soul\\" of the music--especially in the opening for Across the River with the electric violin.  Music moves me anyway and THIS music (Secret World Live) truly touched SOMEthing in me and I LOVED IT!!!  If you like Peter Gabriel, you need this CD no doubt!
6300214370|2.0|This film was silly and dumb the day it came out, and it remains so today, even given the nostalgic smirk that it will conjure up from most of its viewers. The eighties was a time of teen dance movies, and this one cashes in as best it can. A reviewer below is right to point out that the premise of a town that outlaws dancing is utterly ridiculous. (Perhaps had the film been set in the late 1600s it would have been believable, but then they wouldn't have been able to sell the cheesy pop soundtrack.) Along comes the inevitable good-looking rebel to shake things up with his slinky moves. As a period piece, this formulaic eighties film might be good for a few warm guffaws. Otherwise it's pretty insipid, and holds up even less well than many Elvis movies from the sixties.
B000084T18|4.0|First of all, i would like to say that this is one of the bests hip hop cds i have heard. I know there are better cds out there but for being one of the newwest cds out, its very good. I think its funny how people like to make fun of 50 by saying that he is just a newcomer and that without EM and DRE he would have no record. I find that funny because people have no idea that 50 has been rapping for a long time. He wasnt just picked up off the street and put in a studio. He actually has about 5 or 6 records out. But, no, people just  like to make judgements and not even look into their arguement.
0385720920|2.0|This book is disgusting. It goes against the whole nature of humanity. It is the story of a little boy who grows up with his estranged mother - who comes to claim him everytime she gets arrested for various crimes. The mother is mad and the child eventually believes that he is the product of a genetic association between his mother and the foreskin of Jesus Christ. Imagine the storyline. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star because there are several interesting twists throughout the novel
0783227256|4.0|Have the critics of this film's historical &quot;accuracy&quot; never heard of &quot;dramatic license&quot;? If they had, then they would understand that Spielberg, like most of his profession, slightly alters history to make for greater theatrical effect or even heighten the events of the story. &quot;Amistad&quot; achieves both with scenes of horror combined with those of great poignancy that make for a total movie experience.<br />While there are times when the film drags, the performances and the engrossing story itself make up for the few inadequacies. Though stars Morgan Freeman (especially riveting in the inspection of the Amistad scene), Anthony Hopkins, and Matthew McConaughey perform well in their respective roles, the best acting belongs to Djimon Hounsou, Razaag Adoti, and Abu Bakarr Fofanah as three of the Africans, and the underrated Pete Postlethwaite as prosecutor Holabird. Nigel Hawthorne, as the inept President Van Buren, and Peter Firth as a conscious-ridden British ship captain are also memorable.<br />Spielberg skillfully balances a movie that is a courtroom drama mixed with an indictment against the slave system of America's past. The scenes of the events of the cursed &quot;Middle Passage&quot; are as graphic as is possible within the confines of Hollywood filmmaking.<br />John Williams contributes a beautiful and understated score, just below the surface of the on-screen events, providing just enough to carry the story along.
0805062971|5.0|Wow! I was amazed at reading this book. I mean I watched the film but the book really clears out the things that the film didn't. Written in an original style with very original content. It is about anarchy and the fight against the way society has us controlled by advertising and material objects. The narrator discovers Tyler Durden, who helps him realize how passive his life is. Eventually the two of the create Fight Club. Excellent novel. I read it in 2 days, cover to cover. I highly recommend it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|11 words to sum up June 9th...'the new radiohead album 'hail to the thief' is utterly amazing.' i seriously think it is every bit as good as 'ok computer' and i am not even done listening to it the first time through yet! this could be the topper. i love it so much. thom yorke pours out his emotions like toxins and combined is the alternative rock thud of 'ok computer' and the alternative rock thud (with an electro-twist) of 'kid a' on this rollercoaster of an album. great artwork too. possibly one of the coolest album covers ive ever seen. the 13.99 that paid I for it was let alone worth seeing the rest of the artist's work in the liner notes, and to think you also get the best radiohead album yet?!?!?! i'd say that's a pretty good deal. for a starving-artist-type anyway. this disc just simply rocks. i don't think i can explain it any better. produced by nigel goodrich (who by the way produced one of the best albums of last year (beck's 'sea change')). i love this record so much. get it. buy it. buy 5 copies of it. give them away to random people on the street this record is so good...
B00007AJF8|5.0|as always cameron diaz is the best, she plays wonderfully. Even though she plays an unsexy animal fanatic( but not with the penguins, thank godness), she's  stunnig. The story is a little strange, but it's captivating.<BR>Buy this dvd, hear it in german, it's funny!!!
0156027321|5.0|I read this book on my sister's suggestion. She'd agnostic, and after reading the book myself, I was surprised she suggested it. It leaves you with a wonderfully spiritual feeling. Every word is compelling, and though you desire to skim ahead to see what happens, you are far too interested in what is happening now to do so. I can not think of a person who would find this book anything less than a great read. You will have trouble putting it down, and even when you've finished, it will stick with you.
B000092ZYX|5.0|\\" just because you feel it doesn't mean it's there\\" can best describe my feelings i once had for radiohead. around the time of ok computer i could not stand radiohead and though the heap of praise was wasted on a bunch of lousy artists. then 3 years ago i met someone and fell in love. well this person was a big radiohead fan and i sorta got into them. well i bought him kid a and i got to like them even more. after amnesiac i was converted. now with the release of hail to the thief i am ready to crown them my favorite band. the opeing track 2+2=5 is so compelling a song that i can't see the masses not eating it up. the song starts off slow but kicks in high gear and sets up the tone for the rest of the record. the record is a cross-pollination of kid a/amnesiac and ok computer/pablo honey. there hasn't been a band since r.e.m. that has conistently put out consective masterpiece albums. my fav songs are there there, 2+2=5, where i end and you begin, and myxomatosis. the album manages to combine the work of early radiohead and kid a/amnesiac without sounding borrowed or old. the combonation sounds so fresh and so new. and to this music lover who started out hating the group this new incarnation of radiohead may well be thier best.
B0000931OG|2.0|I started listening to Blur at \\"Parklife\\", caught up with their past on \\"Modern Life is Rubbish\\", loved their artsier (but still grounded) work on \\"The Great Escape\\", and followed their spiral into textures and sounds on \\"13\\" and \\"Blur\\".  \\"Think Tank\\" is simply more of the same-textures, sounds, but....NO MEMORABLE SONGS!  I strained to listen to the whole CD.  It just doesn't do anything emotionally for me.  It doesn't connect!  I do like bands that take chances and try new and different things (\\"Think Tank\\" replaced Hatfield and the North's \\"The Rotter's Club\\" in my car's CD player, for Christ's sake!).  But what made Blur interesting in the first place was their songs!  They were skewered songs, but within conventional pop song structures.  But on \\"Think Tank\\", the songs aren't memorable.  In ten years time, listeners will not remember Blur for this CD...they'll remember \\"Parklife\\"!  Sorry!
B000092ZYY|5.0|This album has definitely the mix of Amnesiac and Kid A. The package comes with poster and specially printed lyrics. The rhythmuic parts came back from the virtually absent Amnesiac album. Because of that, the songs are meant to be more acceptable. It is meant for everyone to listen to. And as usual, you need to listen to it over and over to understand the good stuffs. But, great album takes more time to appreciate, right?
B00008J4P5|3.0|...but lotsa hype don't always cut it.<BR>If you think this is great stuff, then buy Led Zeppelin's &quot;How The West Was Won&quot;. Zeppelin mined the same territory with better results...bigger, more textured, better songs. John Bonham or Meg White? Come on!
B000092ZYX|5.0|There are a million different ways one could go about reviewing this album, for there also are a million ways one could begin to address the band that is radiohead.  But being familiar with many forms of music, and all that is involved with music as an artform in general, allows me to review this album with very few words.  In relation to &quot;Hail to The Theif&quot; i would say this;<BR>Radiohead is the best band in the world
B00008LDPU|2.0|Like Matrix Reloaded: lots of hype, lots of anticipation, and man... how disappointing.
B00000DRA9|5.0|The Neverending Story, the soundtrack is part of the reasons why the movie became so successful. Title theme Neverending Story and Bastian's Happy Flight are the uplifting themes which will surely make you want to see the movie.(Atreyu's Quest and Atreyu Meets Falcor and Happy Fight are basically the same as Bastian's Happy Flight but with a bit of different touch). Moody scores such as Swamps of Sadness and Gmork depicting the swift and sly movement of wolf-like evil creature vividly conjure up the part of the movie scene. It is no doubt one of the finest 80's soundtracks. The movie is as great as the soundtrack and the novel has slight different theme from the movie. Both are highly recommendable as well. Also recommended for Harry Potter and Lord of the Ring appreciaters.
0802130208|1.0|Although I'm usually pretty critical of books, it takes a lot in order for me to give a book only one star.  I picked this one up because it had won a Pulitzer and I was going to New Orleans soon and wanted some relevant (fictional) reading.  I don't deny that Toole had some ambitious aims when he began this book--and yes, I agree it's a satire.  But I didn't find it that effective because I could barely recognize humanity in these people.  I usually think of satire as a social criticism involving humor and exaggeration.  This book is filled with exaggerations--but I really didn't find it funny at all.  Moreover, I could see what types of connections the author was trying to make with his critique, but I didn't find them at all compelling or even believable.  In fact, I found the casting to be trite and ill-formed and am forced to agree with previous reviewers in saying that the majority of the book seemed redundant and annoying.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I have nothing actually negative I can say about the movie. It was...EXCELLENT!!! I have Irish pride and the Dead Rabbits are [the best]! I was although really expecting a rather more spectacular finale fight scene that the whole film basically made you anticipate. Interrupted by those damn cannons!!! Great movie none the less, Leonardo, Diaz and definitely Daniel Day-Lewis as the villain all played out excellently with each other. Great acting and overwhelming atmosphere all throughout this great film of a depiction of the first gang wars of the US.
B000092ZYX|5.0|radiohead's new album 'hail to the thief' took me a few listens like every radiohead album with the exception of 'pablo honey' to love. the songs are brilliantly crafted, and the overall feel of the album is superb. I don't want to necessarily say that this is the best radiohead album, but it's RIGHT up there with 'OK Computer' and 'The Bends'. genius.
B000002ADT|5.0|They should issue this album at birth, with the statement, \\"Use this to get through the good and bad times of life\\" on the sleeve somewhere. This is the definitive Jazz album, and a must have for anyone considering getting into the genre. Admittedly, I'm not the biggest Jazz fan in the world, but I couldn't imagine a collection without this. <br />So many reviews have focused on the technical masterpiece of the album. The review by amazon lists all the artists included on this record. To the novice they mean nothing (believe me, soon enough they will), so just take my word for it, this is one of the best ensembles of MUSICIANS (not just jazz) to ever collaborate on one album. I can't picture editing being done at all to this disc, it would seem completely obvious that coltrane, davis, adderly and the rest just sat down and cut the thing in 45 minutes, and called it complete. I've raved enough, but it should be the first album you buy if you even remotely call yourself a music fan.
B000092ZYX|5.0|...and so begins Radiohead's sixth studio album, with one of the great opening songs heard on a CD in some time.  2+2=5 builds into a sonic explosion in the middle of the track, and you get the sense that Radiohead is a band brimming with confidence and that they are doing what they do best, writing great songs, and doing it with relative ease.  You will see reviews of HTTT that lament that it is not a return to The Bends/OKC era.  And you will see reviews that HTTT is not breaking any new ground like Kid A. Thus is the expectation that Radiohead has built for itself, they are constantly being compared to past masterpieces, so much so that people are failing to see that HTTT is yet another masterpiece from one of the great, most innovative bands of this time. Whether people agree with this or not is not the point, the point is that HTTT is miles ahead of anything out there right now.  If this was RH's debut CD, critics would be going wild over it.  As it is, songs like Where I End and You Begin and There There are some of RH's best work.  And A Wolf At The Door is one of the most chilling, yet moving album closers in years.  HTTT is the culmination of everything the band has done since Pablo Honey...it's the best of all of their creative phases, in one CD.
B000092ZYY|5.0|I just wanted to say that this album is awesome!!!! My favorite will always be the Bends.....But this is like Radiohead melted down all their albums and poured it into this one record....It's got a piece of everything in it....from the rockin riffs of Pablo Honey & The Bends to the spaced out psychedlic melodies of OK Computer and last but not least...they piled on the textured sounds from Kid A & Amnesiac......it's an all around beautiful album!!!....Any Radiohead fan would agree......My suggestion to anybody reading this, thinking about buying it.....Stop Thinking about it and JUST DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Well let me start out with this, as with most of Radioheads cd's it takes several listenings to get into the music and understand its complexity.  If your not a true radiohead fan and really dont like the experimental kinda of stuff that they did with albums like Kid A, i would say hold off because you probably wont like it (but thats just my opinion).  A couple tracks go back to the days of OK Computer most notably Scatterbrain and There There.  I read somewhere that they planned this one out like they did with The Bends, well what ever they did u can hear the difference from the last two albums.  As far as song content, it offers views on war, bush(take a look at the title), love, and life. All said and done, this is a great album, and i hope there's many more to come.
B00000G3PA|1.0|This movie is pandering, predictable, awful. What was the point? So many people list this movie on their favorites list, which means the filmmakers did the job they set out to do - make a mindless, inoffensive, lowest-common-denominator film that the teeming masses of American consumers could get behind in their quest to cease critical thought all together. I say, let the meteor hit.
B000092ZYY|5.0|I saw the show at the Beacon Theater and was amazed to realize that the songs from \\"Hail\\" sounded so good even while playing live.  (And they sang 10 out of the 14 tracks...)<BR>This CD is all about connotations and interpretations, which makes Radiohead a pure form of Anarchism; there are no rules, no ways of thinking, understanding and hearing the music. The music is what you feel and the feeling is GREAT. At first hearing, the lyrics might sound like a bunch of codes to the Israeli Mosad. However, after adjusting your spirit you will find an essence, a meaning, once again, very individual, very private.<BR>The sound is great, new, rhythmic, electric, harmonic, kicking, screaming and touching. You can find it all in  \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\" for instance; my favorite track so far, due to the crazy ending.  <BR>I noticed some external influences; \\"Sail to the Moon\\" reminded me of Pink Floyd \\"Dark Side\\" (Nothing wrong with that! On the contrary, it is a good influence). The last song (Wolf at the Door) has the Rhythm of the Beatles' \\"Because\\" (And if not \\"Abbey Road\\" than what???).<BR>I am a big OK Computer fan, and I must say this CD is a great continuation to it. It had fun, sadness, mature factors and stupidity (A song about a cat that got Myxomatosis?!).<BR>Enjoy.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I brought this CD after listening to Hybrid theory.<BR>I was amazed! If you thought Hybrid theory was good then think again, this is better!<BR>The track order is excellent, with the really heavy tracks at the start, gradually cooling down, and a big finish with Numb. Breaking the habit, although very different, stands out as the track that i replay the most. This CD can be amazing versitile. it can be something you jump up and down to, or something to relax you!<br />If you liked Hybrid theory, You'll love this!
B000092ZYX|5.0|I'm going to get right to the point.  This is a fantastic record.  If you are expecting it to break new ground like the last four did, you may be disappointed.  Radiohead did not go a new direction on this one.  Instead, they've explored some of the innovations they already made on the last four records.  If you're a fan of the Bends, you'll be happy to know that Johnny Greenwood is playing some blistering guitar on this one.  If you like OK Computer, you'll be pleased to know that Radiohead has not forgotten how to structure an album around a complicated theme and still rock.  If Kid A and Amnesiac are more your speed, you'll be pleased to know that Radiohead is still experimenting with noise and sound and using many non-traditional rock instruments.  So, groundbreaking?  Who knows.  Ask me in a year or so.  But this is the best rock record of the year so far, and it's bleeding brilliant.  Coldplay, if you're reading, THIS is how it's done.
B000002H97|5.0|When I first heard a lot of the songs on this album, I didn't like them except for \\"Sad but True.\\" However I picked up the CD and \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" \\"God that Failed,\\" and \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" show how well Metallica can write a song. The music isn't the death metal that was evident on ...And Justice For All or Master of Puppets or the other 1980's Albums. This doesn't mean that they lost their edge (Except for the song \\"Nothing Else Matters\\"). They just put more of a rythm to the heavy assault that they have used so well.<BR>Best Metallica Album.
0792833260|5.0|This is one of my favorite moives of all time. I can't count how many times I have watch this moive over and over and I never get sick of it. If you haven't see this moive then you should!!
B00008LDPU|4.0|I wasn't sure whether I wanted to spend my money on a copy of The Animatrix, so I read dozens of reviews and did some research, then decided to go with it. I'm glad I did because I thoroughly enjoyed watching these 9 short films based on the world of The Matrix. Before this I disliked anime, but now I see that it can be used in beautiful ways- the films are very diverse testimonies to that. But, the only full CGI film is the one that looks the best. Anyway, I liked the stories, thought they looked beautiful, and sounded great. 4/5
B000005IU2|5.0|The Stooges and Iggy are my personal favorite &quot;punk&quot; musicians. I've listened to several punk bands and different styles but I think they are by far the most raw and retro. I like mostly music like The Doors and Led Zepplin and I guess that kind of explains why I enjoy the Stooges also. I believe in that the Stooges and the Doors have a lot of comparisons between them, they both expeiremented with blues (doors-L.A. Woman, stooges-L.A. Blues) and they both had &quot;ties&quot; with the Velvet Underground and art rock in general, and both bands of course had charismatic and slightly insane frontmen. Anyways I look at this album as a slightly watered down version of &quot;Raw Power&quot; which I think is a little bit better than this. I listen to this album when I'm in a little more mellow mood and Raw Power is perfect when you want some loud, powerful, one or two chords only rock. I think the jazz and blues elements arent that much of an imporvement nor do they destroy the music. The one thing this album that Raw Power doesnt is an excellent finale, the ending is like a crescendo of guitars, Iggy's psychotic whaling, and just pure noise. Anyways this is an excellent grage/punk album and I highly reccomend it!
0316666343|4.0|When I was going to start reading this book I had expectations as to what I thought it was going to be like.  I read it with justice and revenge in mind.   When I read it at first I was disappointed because that is not what it is about.  But the more I thought of it and the story that was told.... the more I liked it.  I wish I had read it with more of an open mind.  The book did bring out a lot of emotion, I cried and laughed.  The story was told very well and made me look at things in different way.  I will and have recommended the book to friends and family.
B000092ZYY|5.0|there's a reason everyone likes radiohead. this album is, musically, the best to date. ok computer had an amazing impact, but hail to the thief is everything we've come to love about this band since '97 and i haven't met a person who isn't absolutely floored by this album. snicker if you will, record snobs, they may be huge, but you know radiohead is genius.
B0000035GN|4.0|This is probably the only Sebadoh that I will listen to on a regular basis and i haven't heard much of their other material. However, i found that some of the songs seemed to be under par compared to the great ones here. Magnet's Coil, Liscence to confuse, Careful, Dramamine and Not To Amused are the better tunes, and the rest are all filler to me. But these songs don't hold down the band nor the disc. The best part about Sebadoh? This is real rock. Sebadoh is like the Foo Fighters: they don't need to talk about depression, drugs, and stuff like that to get their point across and good guitar rumbling through a lot of people's speakers.
0790729342|4.0|The road warrior is my favorite Mel Gibson film, I like all the action sequences and all. But the DVD is another cheap cardboard one. I really reccemend the DVD only because it's awesome and full of action. Even though i hated when Mel's car was blown up. But i fully reccemend it to any action movie person.
B00008NRI8|2.0|&quot;Two Weeks Notice&quot; stars two appealing people, but they have no chemistry. My dog and cat have more chemistry. Why would a lawyer (Sandra Bullock) want to work for a conceited billionaire (Hugh Grant)? Greed is a bad thing. Falling in love after countless annoying incidents just makes this movie another routine POS. There was one scene where they were playing mixed doubles in tennis and I was truly ashamed with their athleticism. I could've probably beat all of them with my hand tied behind my back because I'm the king of handicap matches. Oh well. This movie really doesn't grab your attention and makes you wish you spent your money on something with substance, like a twinkie.

Her cousin also becomes closer to his dad who in the beginning weren't close at all. They barely saw eachother. Mary says if you look at it closely it's as if the whole world were as a garden. This is suppose to be the VHS version.
006109594X|5.0|&quot;Nimitz Class&quot; A most excellent &quot;fiction&quot;.  I read it prior to 9/11 &amp; walked away wondering if an Islamic radical could carry it out, and that an aircraft carrier is in fact a juicy target.  Way too many hard-nosed military's gave their misguided reviews here.  It's called fiction for a good reason!  I'm military savvy, &amp; I never saw it containing military &quot;flaws.&quot;  Also reminded me of the good partnership the U.S. &amp; British military share &amp; rely on.  A co-worker, a former WWII diesel submariner loved it.  I also passed it on to a West Point graduate &amp; likewise he really liked it.  I passed on a tradition my dad started:  read it &amp; pay it forward.
B000066NW0|5.0|As most decent people have written, this cd is as good as it gets. Since September last year, this c.d hasn't been off my stereo,- and that's saying something! Avril's music has changed my life forever, no doubt about it, and like Britney started a whole new \\"phase\\" Avril has just started her own.<br />Even though it's amazingly hard to chose, everyone has their own fave songs on this album, and here's just MY review.<br />1) Losing Grip - Excellent start to the album, a standout track,- talking about how her old boyfriend was [mean] 9 and a half/10<br />2) Complicated - The start to her career. Great song, funny video clip, great rhythm! 9/10<br />3) Sk8er Boi - When this song came out I learnt the words strait away, and I loved it. Now I'm just a bit over it. Got annoying after a while. 7 and a half/10<br />4) I'm With You - Not many people's, but one of my favourite songs. It's a great slow ballad, singing about being alone. 9 and a half/10<br />5) Mobile - Bit wierd, but great instumentation and Avril's voice sounds amazing. 8/10<br />6) Unwanted - Probably the heavyest song after Losing Grip, and still slow at the same time. Great song. 8/10<br />7) Tomorrow - Probably (if possible) my least fave. song on the disk, I just think it's a bit boring, but that's just my oppinion. 6 and a half/10<br />8) Anything but Ordinary - Awesome! It may be a bit slow, but excellent point she's making and she sounds great too! 9/10<br />9) Things I'll Never Say - Another \\"bit weird\\" song but still good. 7 and a half/10<br />10) My World - Great, fun song where she tells us about her childhood and how she \\"got fired by a fried chicken a*s\\". 9/10<br />11) Nobody's Fool - One of my 2 fave. songs on the album. She raps in the verses, which is funny, but the song has awesome lyrics making it another standout. 10/10<br />12) Too Much to Ask - Another standout, another [mean] boyfriend, who this time \\"Chose weed over me, you're so lame!\\" Great!! 9 and a half/10<br />13) Naked - My other fave. song on this disk. Maybe because it was the first one I could play on the guitar, maybe because I could relate to the lyrics or maybe just coz it was a great end to a great album. 10/10<br />So, if you haven't yet purchased this disk (which I doubt) you should seriously do it... NOW! And find out which are YOUR fave. songs!<br />Also the Complicated & the Sk8er Boi singles are great if you want extra good songs!
0783889836|5.0|Mark Bowden's Black Hawk Down gives an extremely detailed picture of the whole battle in Mogadishu. From the first time the Rangers and Delta hit the Hawks, untill the last shot was fired, I was glued to my chair, like one might be glued to the couch watching a good T.V. show. Extremely detailed withought any confussion, it makes you feel like Bowden made all this up. Wich is the truly amazing thing, every word is true. The book is much better than the movie and should definetly be read by anyone who even remotley liked the movie.
B00005JKZV|3.0|This movie was ok... The fight was great... but one thing leaves me uneasy. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT PROGRESS FROM THE FIRST ONE! Frodo and Sam are still trying to get to the tower... The other hobbits are still lost in the woods... and the armies of the eye almighty is still being built... through in a few trees and you have the two towers... if you just watch the first LotR and the third... you wouldn't miss a thing.. If you'd like to see good fight scenes go see it... other then that just skip this...
B00008LDPU|4.0|This is a very tricky piece to review.  I'm actually torn between three and four stars but I put four simply because of the awesome animation.  <br />The first thing that came to my mind while I watched these short films was that I felt like I was at an independent film festival.  This can be a good or bad thing depending on whether or not you're open to independent type films which can be wierd yet amazing at the same time.<br />However, overall, I can truthfully say I did enjoy this Dvd.  It was kind of like being on a rollercoaster since the stories seemed to change so fast and were only about nine or ten minutes each.  The only problem with this was the fact that each story seemed very rushed and by the time you felt the slightest bit of attatchment to the characters or plot (or even figured out finally what the plot was) it was over and you were on to next episode.<br />There were actually only about two episodes I did not like and one I was very uncertain about.  I wasn't fond of Detective Story because it seemed to be building to something and when it got there, it just fell and then stopped.  However, once again, the art was amazing! I've never seen anime in all gritty blacks, whites and grays before and it was really cool to look at.<br />I also didn't like Matriculated mostly because aside from the interesting concept it presented of trying to sway a machine into joining the human side, it was a major let down at the end.  In my opinion, stories that end in simply death are too lazy to think of a more creative way to save their characters.  Its much easier to kill of people than to save them.<br />World Record is one I'm not certain about.  I liked the idea and the anime was interesting but the way it was presented was somewhat strange.  I really think they could have gone about it better. It's showing someone surpassing their limits and therefore breaking out of the matrix by accident.  Hovever, once again, we're left with a ending that leaves you angry.<br />The Final Flight of the Osiris was very entertaining and I loved the Computer Graphics.  You feel a great deal for the two main characters and it acts as sort of a trailer to the Matrix Reloaded.<br />Program was a wonderful short story with beautiful character designs and great fight scenes.  It deals with the tempation of going back to the Matrix and returning to a life of ignorant bliss.<br />Beyond was cool mostly for the animation and the way they represented the Matrix and how messed up things could be.  The focal point is a house that appears to be a glitch or defective spot in the matrix world.  A teenage girl and a few kids stumble upon it and find they can do amazing things there because they believe it's \\"haunted\\".  <br />Kid's Story was probably one of my favorites.  The story is thrilling and shows an escape from the matrix world.  The art is very unique and has a squiggled, sketchy quality that gives the impression of motion,speed and anxiety. I found it very interesting.  <br />The Second Renaissance parts one and two are also my favorites.  They tell the past and explain how the machines rose up against the humans in the first place.  These are extremely interesting and thought provoking, dealing with many psychological issues as well. <br />All in all, I did like this DVD and I'm glad I purchased it.  The episodes I liked far outweighed the ones I didn't and the entire package is a feast for the eyes.
0446608955|5.0|If you liked the movie than you will love the book. The book is so much better, and the movie does not do it justice.
B00008S2VG|5.0|At first i didn't like it, then for some reason I started liking it. I think it's a great album, and if you like Madonna, you'll probably like it.
0792843835|5.0|When I watched this movie for the first time, I was quite surprised. Because I had to watch it for my class assignment, so at first, I did not expect much. However, unexpectedly, the movie was a thing! <br />Above all, I like all the characters in that movie. Jasmin, (Actress Marianne S?ebrecht-Sugarbaby) a German woman abandoned by her husband in the Mojave desert becomes a member of the society of Bagdad caf? I was deeply affected by the process of her belonging into a kooky community at a remote caf? Jasmin as a typical German housewife, she likes all things clean and neat. She always wants to put things in order and sweep. At first, she goes through some quarrels with Brenda during getting to understand each other. Finally, the hostess gets to accept her sincerity, and Jasmin gradually succeeds in changing the sleepy and desolate coffee shop into a fascinating and popular roadside refuge. Jasmin, armed with a mop and a magic kit, brings happiness into the wasteland. She, as a German woman, makes an American remote community into a mixture spot of two cultures-neatness & freedom and self-centered world. Maybe this is a German movie, so the director wants to show the virtues of Germany. Due to this point, the good things of Germany are embossed much more than America, I think. Anyhow, I felt that it was quite successful and appealed. <BR>The second character, Brenda, (Actress C.C.H. Pounder-television series: ER) gives an atypically sloppy impression as the caf?owner. She is always spunky, loud and bad-tempered. She does not trust other person if he is a stranger. Brenda, the owner, doubts her guest, Jasmin, only because she has a trunk filled with just man's clothes and seems suspicious. She is very unyielding even to her husband, so makes her husband leave the house. She has a family of a son who is young but already father of a baby and a girl who likes to go out with guys. However, after Jasmin's arrival, she gets much confusion. What she thought as her own proper world but not hopeful begins to stagger, and she gets angry with that. At the beginning, she does not want to have changes in her life, so she is hostile to the newcomer. She gets in trouble with Jasmin a few times, and finally, she gets to understand and resemble her. Those two women actually had many common things like husband who left her, feeling solitude and needing somebody who can apprehend considerately and accept herself as she is. They did not recognize some common things in their minds at first, but later, they could promote mutual understanding each other. They become true friends from the bottom of their hearts. <BR>Third, Jack Palance acts as a wonderful as an artist who wants to capture on canvas the beauty he perceives in the rotund Jasmin's warm. He caught her own beauty in his drawings and painted her with slightly unreal colors. Those portraits of her contain almost everything what the films wants to show us, I think. It gives the film a hint of fantasy and time standing still for a life. The artist knew how to manifest her innate beauty to the outer world. He captured what others could not see but exist obviously. Her beauty maybe exists in all of us, and the director tells us to find each power and beauty. The artist falls in live with Jasmin during painting, and then succeeds to get married with her.<BR>Other characters in that movie are all same kind of people. They are neglected by the society, and just live in their own community `Bagdad caf?. They do not have hopes to make any achievements. <BR>Brenda's son has a baby but does not have a wife. He has no skill for living, and just does nothing except playing the piano. He loves music, but his mother, Brenda hates that. He hopes somebody who understands his music to appear. Suddenly, Jasmin appears in front of him, and he retakes happiness from having someone who likes his playing. <BR>Another guy, a traveler, is an exception who shows the liveliness. He is the unique person among the nerveless people except Jasmin. He always throws a boomerang. That boomerang flies away but comes back soon. It means many things. Maybe I can tell that the boomerang's flight suggests Jasmin's fate. Jasmin leaves for her country, Germany because of visa problems, but comes back to her real life in Bagdad caf? For she found her soul in remote American desert, she could not help coming back there.            <BR>   <BR>\\"Bagdad Caf? ranks near the top of my life favorite movies list. With wonderful performances by the entire actors and actresses (especially the acts between Sagebrecht-`Jasmin?and Pounder-`Brenda?, the focus is on the power of friendship and understanding. Rigidly coiled in tweeds, Jasmin is formal and uptight, yet curious. Equally enclosed in anger, Brenda is cold and has a distant air. Yet these two women find common grounds- the fact of their both having been abandoned--to create (literally) magic, even joy. <BR>I feel that the painter in the movie (Actor Palance) is very lovely and also seems a little sad. He finds beauty in attractive Jasmin and gently assists in her emancipation. <BR>The soundtrack is, as it were, one of my favorite soundtracks. The title song \\"I Am Calling You\\" is really unforgettable and perfect. It matches very well with this movie. The perfect accompaniment to a place and time and a group of people whose lives are reinvented and greatly improved as a result of their moving past former imposed constraints (both social and circumstantial) to find a real happiness simply in being alive.
1556154844|4.0|Code Complete is a book for every beginner-intermediate level programmer. This book is for people serious about programming. This book is not based on syntask of any language but it more like tells you how to be a good programmer. It teaches you how to write better code. Steve McConnell has done a great job by compiling such  enormous amounts of techniques, practices you can use to be a better programmer. Surely all of it has been compiled from years of experience. For a beginner it will be a huge leap towards being a professional. This book focses on code construction. The last few chapters tell us how our own character effects our code and how focusing on our personal character we can be better programmers. On the other side this book is about 800 pages long. It gets pretty dull and dry in the middle, but most of it is valuable stuff. It might be hard to finish the book but once you have you can give a pat on your own back for doing a great job.
0380002930|3.0|I admit, going into this book I thought it was going to be terrible. It was not my favorite book, but it was kind of entertaining. It is not the kind of book I would usually read, so it broadened my horizons.I did almost fall asleep a couple of times, and I didn't really have a drive to read it(English assignment). I thought the whole plot got really predictable towards the end. I also thought it to be bland with no real variety in sentences. So overall, if your into this variety of books, you will probably like it, but if you are a literal thinker, you will probably find it boring and silly.
B00006LLLN|5.0|I'd heard some AKUS songs before, and I knew they were a talented band, but this 2 CD album (and what a great price!) really blew me away. Alison and crew are extraordinary musicians, and there's something on this album for everyone. I agree with all the praise in other reviews, but for my two cents &quot;We Hide &amp; Seek&quot; (an instrumental) is the best thing on the album. I've played it over and over for days, and if it doesn't get your heart soaring and your foot tapping, then, well, I'm afraid you're not alive. :) Just a great album, up there for me with a classic like &quot;Graceland&quot; by Paul Simon.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This movie is the best movie in the world!!!!<br />I don't get the people who say they didn't like it; but wait, yes I do--they don't have the imagination and creativy to understand it!!! If you din't like this movie, then why are you taking your oh-so \\"valuable time\\" to review?<br />I'll tell your the real truth about this movie, your first-timers, considering the fact that these critics didn't give you ANY reason why \\"they thought this movie was horrible':<br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are absolutely DAZZLING as the two star-crossed lovers of the film. They are believeable and wonderful. Not of you critics could even wish to be as talented as this two amazing actors. Nicole and Ewan's voices are charming to listen to. (This film was NOT A VOICE-OVER, while Chicago[that moulin rouge wannabe] was.) and the dance sequences are a delight to watch. Also, this soundtrack was great. Everyone knows these songs, so of course you weren't sitting there praying for them to hurry up and stop singing, because you could sing along.<br />The fact is, the only reason Chicago was made, was the fact that Moulin Rouge did so well at the box-office. Why don't you critics think about that and in the process--why don't you stop raining on a GREAT MOVIE!<br />People who didn't like this need a hobby or something, because you are too boring to watch this Spectular film!

B000075BFL|5.0|I normally give every PAC album 5 stars but this one deserves 6. This is classic Tupac right here. The things he says here are things that cant be copied by noone whether its JAY-Z, NAS or JA RULE. YOU cant copy this legend. CD 1 is slightly better then CD 2 but both are still fabulous. Every tupac album is a classic but this is tha bomb right here. A MUST FOR ANY RAP/HIPHOP COLLECTION.
0694003611|4.0|Although this book has some pretty graphic drawings reminiscent of Paul Rand, in nice primary colors, I found the characters to be rather one-dimensional. Their development is entirely absent, and even a method actor couldn't find their motivation. For example, why don't the cats and kittens devour the rabbits? <br />This book is divided into two sections, which do segue into each other nicely.  There is the \\"before bed\\" first act, and then the denouement, in which the protagonists sharing their cozy middle class abode wish each other \\"goodnight.\\"<br />I found Eugene O'Neill's \\"Long Day's Journey Into Night\\" to be a more thought-provoking and cathartic study on a similar theme. However, \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is prescient in that it is a harbinger to many of the plots of the 1970s television series, \\"The Waltons.\\"

B00008G9JO|5.0|Having attended over 75TULL shows over the past 27 years I am somewhat biased.  I find good in every Tull album, and enjoy every Tull album.  Heavy Horses marked a change in style for Ian and the boys.  His voice seemed to almost be a whisper to nature, perhaps trying to be unnoticed by those on the &quot;farm&quot;.  However, the songs are powerful, poignant, and in some cases sensual (Acre's Wild).  Having all of Tull's albums plus several &quot;bootleg&quot; records and all imports and other hard to find gems, I rate this as one of Tull's finest.  I played in daily while a senior in high school the year it was released.  Although I have this album only on vinyl, I listen to the album today, and when I do listen to it, I am moved back in time, to a farm in Scotland, among the acre's wild...
B000092ZYX|4.0|Well, these day's rock and roll is dead, unless you consider Limp and LinPark rock. Radiohead, however, fill the void in this seemingly long stagnation in rock. Oasis may still be rocking but they were only leading the pack for a week, radiohead on the other hand, has been guiding the pack since OK Computer. When Kid A was released in 2000 it was welcomed with confusion and mixed reviews, however, listening to it three years later, one can't help but consider Thom and co. genius's. Ed, Jonny, Colin, and Phil are as integral in the band as George and Ringo were in the Beatles, just listen to Go To Sleep. Hail To The Theif begins with a classic introduction similar to Kid A's Everything In It's Right Place, but soon 2+2=5 builds into a grandious crescendo where rock meets electronica, and not sounding bad at all. New Order would be proud. Sit Down, Stand Up follows a similar structure. Starts softly but then builds up to this missile firing electronica while Phil gets to work on his drum beats. Sail To the Moon is an experience to behold. The only thing similar to this song is Fake Plastic Tree's, this one will one day be on a greatest hits package. I will not critque this one, experience it for yourself. Backdrifts lives up to the its name, you hear backward loops of beats with electric drum's, hmm..excellent rhythm, this one will be addicting to hear over and over again. Go To Sleep, we finally get a guitar driven song on this one. Definetly the I Might Be Wrong song on this album. You can really hear the reminents of The Bends on this one, this is one of their more stronger songs and sounds most likely to become a single. We finally get a bass driven hook and will be a live favorite. We Suck Young Blood is a very melodic song hanged together will Phil's air brushing drum technic. The Gloaming, this was considered to be the albums title, again we say hello to an electronica driven beats and swirls, but this is to be greeted welcomingly. Now we come to the first single and what everyone has probably heard already, There There. This is getting heavy rotation on MTV2, which is one of the few rock songs to be featured on there. This is not a surprise it's their first single, its the strongest beat driven, rock and roll single since Paranoid Android (Knives Out was not as good as this). The druming is excellent and the band is at their best on this, the guitar's drive the song instead of the electronica...old fans are probably proud of this. I Will is a very relaxed song which will bring you down from your high after There There and is the bridge that connects the to final section of the album. A Punch Up AT A Wedding is a piano driven song comparable to the Egyptian Song, however, I consider this to be the stronger of the two. You are treated to layers of piano chords and and once again, Phil's beat maintains the ground of the song. Effects on this song is greated with a surprise, you hear galactic noises, almost Third Stone From The Sun feel by Jimi. Myxomatosis sounds something like the Beatles would have made if they had the technology at the time. This is a guitar distortion driven song that radiates its sounds to full force and played loudly will drive your nieghbor's crazy (all the more reason to do so!). Scatterbrain is a handled by Thom's voice and we now know the end is going to come: it's the Lucky of the album. Now Wolf At The Door closes the album. It's once again grounded on Thom's strong voice which builds from a high to a low and has layers of music which lends some support to Thom. It's a real melody treat and closes the album which by this time, leaves you yearning for more. I give this a four because I really feel that the album is still not concluded. It doesnt give us something comparable to The Tourist nor Street Spirit. Motion Picture Soundtrack even presented some real sense of conclusion, I mean, that was just as comparable to The Beatles White Album with Goodnight. But if Thom and co. thought it was a goodone, then I wont [go on] about it too much. Excellent album, good for any music collector or even for a person curious enough to give it a shot.  WARNING: If you have not seen this band live, you will not grasp the music to its full potential, they are one of the best bands to see live right now: this is to be experienced LIVE.
B00005T30L|5.0|\\"Ghost World\\" is a sad world, a place for eccentric losers, a visual poem composed to those in the so-called \\"real\\" world who want to take a permanent detour.<br />Those denizens of the \\"real\\" world will try to make you feel guilty for not being one of them, for not fitting in. You will be laughed at for your unabashed love for music or a movie no one cares about any longer. You are so out of it, you don't even know who won game 3 of the NBA championships.<br />Seymour is such a personage: His crime is having his own tastes, not dressing in the socially-accepted fashion approved of by his middle-managment bosses, not paddling his canoe with the mainstream, but not against it, either. He's sitting on the shore, reading a book of his own choosing.<br />His attempts to find love with a woman from the \\"real\\" world only end in disaster. Obviously, the fellow needs psychotherapy.<br />But, Seymour meets Enid, or rather, Enid meets Seymour, through a cruel prank she plays. Enid has long since given up on the \\"real\\" world, but occasionally makes the mistake of so shunning humanity that she can't recognise the victims of the \\"real\\" world from its movers and shakers. But then, she finds Seymour. Unfortunately, she never finds herself.<br />The theme of \\"Ghost World\\" is so eloquently simple, yet tragically true: There are no happy endings in the \\"real\\" world, and the \\"real\\" world rears its ugly head into the reality of those who live by their own standards all too intrusively.<br />Are there happy endings in the Ghost World? Probably not. Some people don't really know what happiness is. They have been cast out, blackballed and discarded.<br />Such people are only fooling themselves: They have that mark upon them, the mark of earnestness, of discrimination, of taste, of intelligence. They shall be denied happiness. They are easily exposed, and their pretense at happiness is but a sham and sad attempt to salvage defective thoughts and feelings into a jury-rigged, ersatz worldview.<br />There is only happiness in the mainstream, a ready-made world in which one need not think too much. Ignorance is bliss. Those who are not ignorant are the true fools, and they need counseling. Medication, perhaps.<br />Then they will join the great mass of humanity. They will thrill to \\"The Flower that Drank the Moon.\\" They will eagerly tune in to see Katie and Matt on the \\"Today\\" show in the morning, and Jennifer and Courteney on \\"Friends\\" in the evenings.<br />Life can be made so comfortable.<br />If you've ever felt alone.<br />If you've ever felt different.<br />Or, if you've felt like a freak, for no reason at all. A rag doll missing a button eye and the stuffing from your left arm, stranded on the Isle of Misfit Toys.<br />There's a world for you. An imperfect world, but one that takes on reality on its own terms, and foregoes the soma and sacharrine.<br />That it is better to be alienated and depressed in the Ghost World than it is to be numbly happy in the \\"real\\" world is this movie's tragedy.<br />Or its redemption.<br />Find out.
B00004R9A4|4.0|I remember seeing this movie almost 15 years ago and falling in love with it. When I saw it on the store shelf the other day in DVD finally, I couldn't resist. I didn't even realize new footage had been added until I started watching it, and I began seeing all these strange new scenes.<br />I tend to agree with other reviewers about the full-length edition kind of dragging the movie out. There should be an option to see it either in full, or as it was cut. That would have taken a minimal amount of effort, as they did for Independence Day.<br />The worst part I thought was the shoddy attempt to dub the audio in the newly restored scenes. Not only were the characters mouthing (syncing) something different than what you heard, but the new voices weren't even close to the originals! I don't expect perfection, but they could have found more accurate dubbing voices if they really tried. It was quite distracting, but those are my only complaints, which calls for the absence of one star in my rating. The rest of the movie is a treasure to watch. I like the 2 new songs that they originally left out.<br />Not everyone may like the movie as I do, as it wasn't that popular to begin with. If you are hesitant or unsure, I would recommend renting it first before you consider adding it to your collection.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Since Radiohead released OK Computer, they have been sliding towards more experimental electronic music. Amnesiac and Kid A were dark, troubled CD's that were hard to listen to: not for lack of musical talent, but for the emotions and ideas that they raised within. Hail to the Thief gives its listeners a refresher course in its alternative rock roots but at the same time delivers plenty of well-placed ambient noise and despair. For those of us that have ever wanted a Radiohead album that was a mix of Pablo Honey and Amnesiac, this is the album we've been waiting for.    This CD is highly recommended for its approachable musical themes as well as its message: the helplessness we all feel with our current situation with Iraq and terrorist organizations and the American response to those situations. The CD starts out with the song, 2+2=5, a scathing representation of our apathy towards the direction our world leaders are headed. \\"Are you such a dreamer - to put the world to rights - I'll stay home forever - where two and two always makes a five.\\" For those of us feeling frustration over what we see in the world today, Hail to the Thief provides both explanation and inspiration.     In my opinion, easily the best Radiohead CD to date.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is beautiful.<BR>I cried.<br />This album is heaven sent....as radiohead has in the past they continue to blow me away. This cd allows for the application of a subjective meaning....thats the beauty of radiohead. <br />While listening to stand up, sit down....at the end of the song, i was so overcome by its power i went into a stage 2 seizure...but it was worth it. <br />I only hope people can see what ive seen in this album.<BR>f the government.
B00000ILDE|5.0|I've always been a big fan of the Alien series. They all seem to have just the right blend of everything, but this one... THIS ONE... hehehe. This is by far the best in the series. It's the most intense, well thought out action/sci-fi I've ever seen. The Matrix? It's got nothing on this. Watch this and you'll find some of the coolest lines ever (Hudson), sweet cinematography, and by far the most thrilling action shoot-out ever put to film. If you've never seen this, go buy it. It's that good.
0156027321|4.0|Life of Pi has one of the strangest beginnings that I have ever read.  The narrator gives us many small and random facts about zoology, then proceeds to detail his interest in Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism, and how he practices all three religions at the same time.  Not exactly gripping writing, or similar to the survival story described on the back jacket.  But, near page 100, Life of Pi abruptly transitions.  Our hero, Pi, leaves India with his family and their zoo animals, (his family runs a zoo) on a cargo ship bound for a new life in Canada.  But, the cargo ship soon sinks and Pi is left on a life raft with a tiger.  Now, the real book begins.  Pi must survive on a small life raft with a massive tiger.  The meat of the novel is Pi explaining his activities while on the high seas.  But, as the novel continues, his exploits change from the normal, collecting water when it rains; to the hard to believe, going blind and meeting fellow survivors.  Predictably, Pi survives, and the author's purpose of writing the novel becomes clear when he is interrogated.  Life of Pi can be read two ways, as a exciting survival story with a bad beginning; or as an allegory for the two different ways in which events can play out, the reader not knowing which way actually happened, and which way was fantasy.  Because of the questions it raises, Life of Pi would be an excellent discussion book for a book club, however, it is enjoyable when read alone as well.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Or the Gloaming, meaning twilight or early evening -what a deft description of this album. Starting with track one, 2+2+5, you get a sense of the time just before darkness when all things possible come out to play. The music contains layers upon layers (if you have a home theatre, listen to each speaker individually) and the soothing yet intense lyrics tend to imply a battle between ones sense of control and indulgence. The album rounds out nicely with A wolf at the Door, a track that implies the feeling one tends to get after an evening of adventures -making your way home as the sun quietly begins to rise and you begin to come down. Overall this is a great album, and like the best of them, it only grows better with each listen.
B000002UJQ|5.0|beautiful<br />how can people not give this 5 stars.....get out of the house, turn off mtv jock jams and start living.
B0000067X1|5.0|This is a stunningly complex and outright mythical record. I truly felt unworthy to hear such a brilliant piece of artwork. That is all.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Finally they've struck a balance between spacey and rocked-out.  I completely enjoyed Kid A and Amnesiac, but I longed for some rocking Radiohead in the midst of all the bleeps, blops, and strung out madness that was their experimentation.  Here we seem to have found a balance with many electronic beats with an always-flowing shout from Yorke.  Favorites as of now include Sail to the Moon, Myxamatosis, There there, Punchup..Wedding, and the rest are not far behind.  Entire album is awsome - no skip songs and no BS as usual.  Go grab it - it's Radiohead at their best.
0316666343|1.0|&quot;Lovely Bones&quot; seemed more to be a book written to be a bestseller than a book that was written and happened to become one...
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead fans...this one is defiantly for you.  Over the years the band has obviously made some significant sound adjustments and image tweaking but, ultimately, have produced some of the most beautiful compositions modern rock has ever seen...Hail proves to be no different.  I'm sure most of you have heard that this album is a huge &quot;welcome back&quot; to Radiohead's rock &amp; roll roots and that it will remind you of The Bends era but (in all reality) it isn't and it probably won't.  Hail holds its own personality while incorporating some the band's previous sounds and beats.  Yes, it is much more guitar oriented but that is only a tiny aspect of the finished product.  Hail to the Thief is much more simplistic in comparison to Amnesiac and Kid A but is just as deep in a tonal and intellectual sense.  Believe me when I say that there is something in this album for everyone.   5 stars for Radiohead's latest effort.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I had high hopes of this DVD, and I wasn't disappointed. The story, animation and feel of the movie were so unusual and enthralling that I sat through 2 veiwings back to back.<br />It makes such a change from the usual fare of Disney(ish) films issued for families, not that all Disney films are bad, but they do tend to be a bit bland and formulaic. This film keeps you thinking.<br />Some younger kids will find it a bit hard going.<br />Why did I have to get this film imported from the US tho?<br />Neill
B000002H6C|5.0|One Of there best and still a much needed album of any Metallica Fan!!
B00008DDSA|5.0|This movie appeals to a very specific type of person, and you know who you are.<BR>5 Stars
B00000DHZJ|5.0|This is all you need!  Not only does this include the radio hits (Purple Haze, Fire, etc.), but it also includes some of the under-rated gems that should have been hits (Bold as Love, Castles Made of Sand). This 20 track disc also includes the classic Woodstock performance of the Star Spangled Banner which is as much a historic moment as it is musical perfection.<br />Whether you're new to Hendrix or familiar, this cd satisfies. It may leave you wanting more, but personally, I feel all his best songs are accounted for. The only other cd I would strongly suggest buying would be Band of Gypsys which displays Jimi's tremendous talents in concert.<br />If you haven't agreed with anything I've said thus far, you can't deny that Hendrix was a true innovator of music and in the short 4 years that he recorded music, he accomplished more than most artists do in a lifetime. The Ultimate Experience is proof of that fact.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This was my most anticipated release of the year, and I haven't been disappointed, this is much more accessible on first listening than either Kid-A or Amnesiac as both of these required considerable effort from the listener. <br />There seems to be a return to more melodic style for several of the tracks (Think Fake Plastic Trees, Street Spirit) esp. Scatterbrain and Sail to the Moon.<br />There There is also a superb opening single that really expresses the feel of the album.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This album is solidly crafted. I got this a couple days ago and haven't been able to take it out of my CD player. I like the experimentation on this album. Great mixture of acoustic guitars and piano with clean vox. My Favorite songs on this album currently is &quot;In My Time of Need&quot; &quot;To Rid the Disease&quot; and &quot;Windowpane&quot;. The songs on this album are just downright catchy. Highly Recommended!If you are new to this band I suggest you get this album and &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; or &quot;Deliverance&quot;.
B00006ZSAD|4.0|Mesmerizing, compelling, haunting, alluring, quirky....the work has the spirit and sparseness of some of  (posthumous) legend Nick Drake's fine efforts yet doesn't quite claim the same melodic accessibility.<br />Still, in its own right, some tracks shine more than others in this regard while some are downright spooky, using studio wizardry to full effect (in the most subltle yet effective of means). Arrangements are often brilliant by introducing background vocals which only occur once in the song- where you'd expect the same hook to occur, an even more beautiful melodic motif is introduced. I don't generally find myself waxing on technically but after repeated listenings, one can't help become increasingly sensitive to these musical elements. <br />Fine thought out music- each track a slightly different feel from the others. The kind of record you &quot;get&quot; and pity those who don't- the intimacy  of Beth's voice combines an understated strength while the initial esthetic reveals a fragility and openess so sorely lacking in most of today's purported &quot;musician&quot;'s product.<br />Bravo and looking forward to the next. Portishead fans should appreciate the move towards this refined, if edgy, folk. In my humble opinion, the one track which feels out of place was released as a single. It is worth a listen but doesn't fit the general mood at all- r &amp; b  inspired alright  but doubtful it was the artists' original guiding light when their collaborations first began.
B000092ZYX|5.0|people, radioheads new album is not only truly astoundingly beutiful and haunting, but it continues to show radioheads ability to reinvent itself.<BR>This album is somewhere in between those two great albums known as 'the bends' and 'ok computer' combining the greatest of the two albums. rocking guitars combine with various crazy computer noises to make this up there with the best. Thom Yorke no longer howls songs to the stars but rather sings his soaring lyrics with more of a passion, and more of an intensity.<BR>Hail to the Thief definitely has some funky tunes in it as well, which is rather surprising. Some songs are there that can really be grooved to.<BR>Definite highlight is 2 + 2 = 5 <BR>this great song combines radioheads veiws on the current world order with soaring harmonies, guitars, and funky computer sounds.<BR>Overall 'hail to the thief' is a thoroughly fantastically amazing cd, and truely gives ok computer and the bends a run for best album of all time
B00008PX8P|5.0|This is an inspiring collection that was obviously a labor of love for Page.  The intensity of &quot;Kashmir&quot; is worth the price alone.  I was a teenager when Bonham died - never got the chance to see them perform.  <br />Even with all the remixing and fine-tuning, this is a compelling musical vision.  It may not be 100% &quot;as it was,&quot; but it looks and sounds great!
B000092ZYY|3.0|I agree with the reviewer that Radiohead takes a couple of listens to appreciate but i am not currently impressed with this album.  I long for the anthemic granduer that was OK Computer and the Bends.  I think i can grow to appreciate their later records but not love them.  But you have to respect a band who is constantly pushing their limits and the limits of popular music.
6303481272|5.0|I have naver seen a cartoon with so mush blood and gor and i like my blood and gor.
B000092ZYY|5.0|this cd is increadibly good. It embodies all aspects of the essential radiohead sound. If you are a radiohead fan this is a must buy (even if you already downloaded it). Also if you are just getting into radiohead this is the perfect album to start with (then get ok computer). Overall this cd is mad dank in all aspects and I also saw them at field day and they were amazing.
0380977788|5.0|It was a great book. I usually have a hard time getting into a book but I couldn't put Coraline down. Though the cover and pictures look a little crazed, it isn't scary. It had me reading all the time until I finished, and I loved the way the it ended. I would say it's the best book I've ever read.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|When i purchased this cd, at first glance i saw all the great tracks ands immediatly parted with my money, but when i got home i realised to my shock that the greatest fleetwood mac song(possibly of all time?) was not on it! Where is &quot;Man Of The World&quot;? How can you call this a greatest hits without it? also missing is &quot;The Boy Is Crackin Up&quot;, although i'm not a very big fan of that song, but still..i mean, c'mon!
B00005JKPF|5.0|when i watched the first film i thought to myself hmm?<BR>it was good but didn't do justice to the comic and animated versions. it was too short a film, less than 90min, didn't give time to the story line to develop. It was predictable, the action lacked a certin originality to it.<BR>i think this conclusion comes from the fact not enough of the characters from the animated\comic versions were there. and those that were didnt have time to develop.<BR>THIS FILM WAS RUSHED!!! and \\"bryan singer\\" during an interview asumed he had time and was corrected upon this assumption by the producers i think they were. this interview is on the DVD special features.<br />this is not so with the \\"sequel\\". the length of the film was perfect, gave the story line time to develop and the characters to become more involved with their roles. <BR>the intensity of action and violence were in the right amount and were used in the correct scenes. to sum it up it gave me a great buzz at the right time and i was engrosed in the film from beginning to end.
B00005LK94|5.0|The great thing about this film is the way they integrate two films in one. First is the story of a young teenage girl, marvelously portrayed by Anna Paquin, who is forced to move to Canada to live with her father, whom she barely knows, after her mother dies. The second story is how she cares for a gaggle of geese who have her imprinted as their mother, and how she and her father decide to help the geese migrate to the Southern United States rather than have their wings clipped and live as tame rather than wild geese. As the two of them first learn to fly the ultra light aircraft that they will use to transport the geese and then actually undertake the journey to lead the geese south, they too manage to bond, just as the girl has with her geese. The end, when the girl has to fly the final leg by herself after her father has sustained an injury, will bring a tear to the eye of even the most flinty-hearted individual.<br />This is one of those films that some film viewers might overlook that they ought not. Many films are driven by cinematics; some, like this one, are driven by a marvelous story. I think just about everyone should give this film a chance, but parents with daughters should especially search this one out. As a single father of a daughter, I know from experience that this is the kind of film a young girl especially will find inspiration in.
0156027321|4.0|The Life of Pi is probably one of the most original, thought provoking books ever written. The premise alone supplies more imagination than any other five books by a single author. While many people here have decided to give a plot synopsis, I don't think another one is necessary. The Life of Pi is like something you will never read again. Whether or not you choose to believe the fanicfull version (which makes up the entire book)that comes straight out of a childrens book or the realistic version that comes along at the very end, you can never be sure which is right. <br />If nothing else The Life of Pi reaffirms life and the ability for man to overcome any obstacle, whether it is a Bengal tiger, or a ruffian French cook. <br />As unbelieveable as it sounds it is yet quite belivable, yet I think people managed to miss the point. Yann Martell claims the book will make you believe in god. It will not if anything the Life of Pi will make you believe in the human spirit, a spirit that can overcome any adversity. Something only attainable when faith is put into god. <br />The final page of the book sums it up perfectly Martell and Pi do not care if you believe one story or another. The only person who knows which story true is Pi himself. They only ask that you believe in the spirit of man to overcome any adversity. <br />If your reading this and still on the fence whether to get The Life of Pi do yourself a favor and get it. It is like nothing you have ever read before, and will only reaffirms the inner fortitude of man. I cannot reccomend this book enough.
B00008LDPU|3.0|After seeing the teaser Animatrix about The Osiris inthe movies, I was excited when my roommate got it on DVD, but after watching The Flight of The Osiris and getting into some of the other short animations, I realized that the first short was also the best.  If you're looking for computer animation and interesting story lines, I would suggest watching the first Matrix movie, but there are some interesting revelations that tie into the second movie...overall, I would say rent it!
0385504209|3.0|If you have read HOLY BLOOD, HOLY GRAIL (1983) or similar books you may find this story entirely too predictable to enjoy.  The central plot twists are based on traditions, speculations and legends previously published in other books.  If you are not at all familiar with these theories you will probably enjoy the story.  Whether you believe them or not the theories are interesting enough to carry the plot.
B00000DHTF|4.0|Most artists shouldn't have collections of outtakes and unreleased songs, but most nowadays do. Often they're disappointing. You have to be very prolific and very good to make them worthwhile. You also have to be a questionable arbiter of your own material to keep such good material off your &quot;official releases&quot; (something Bob Dylan's been accused of). But, there is a reason why Springsteen, like Prince, Neil Young, and Dylan, is widely bootlegged, and not just for his amazing concerts. He is prolific, he is very good. BUT, he is a pretty good judge of his own material. A few lapses, but he still bats close to a 1.000.<br />The set starts off with a few demos. Here's a young man, hungry, ambitious, exploding with nervous energy and ideas, rushing through his songs on just his voice and an acoustic guitar. Upon repeated listening, they pale to the live, full-band versions, all except &quot;Growin' Up.&quot; A great, great version. Next up, a great live cut, &quot;Bishop Danced,&quot; just Bruce with Federici on accordian. It's a lost classic, and so is &quot;Thundercrack.&quot;  &quot;Seaside Bar Song&quot; is a good-time, swinging record, but &quot;Santa Ana,&quot; &quot;Zero...,&quot; and &quot;Linda...&quot; don't take off, lyrically or musically. I almost turn off the record, but then things pick up with the lost classic &quot;Thundercrack.&quot; The best of the rest, a rocking live &quot;Rendezvous,&quot; the retro, pile-driving &quot;Give The Girl A Kiss&quot; and &quot;So Young...,&quot; the slow, romantic &quot;Hearts Of Stone,&quot; and a slow, brooding &quot;Iceman&quot; are all good, but they don't match what you find on &quot;Darkness On The Edge Of Town&quot; or &quot;The River.&quot; Either it's not quite as good or thematically, it clashes too much, or both. On a few, Bruce doesn't get through the whole song without botching the lyrics (luckily, they print them up for you). Still, a song like &quot;Restless Nights&quot; has a killer guitar break even if it isn't one of Bruce's best songs. The middle of the set is sustained by some excellent B-sides from the singles off the &quot;Born In The USA&quot; Lp, but the stand-out is the acoustic version of that Lp's title track. It  takes the song somewhere darker, more disturbing, and ultimately saves the song from being hijacked as a widely-misinterpeted arena anthem. Bruce's 'cars and girls' songs are getting better, too. By 1978, they already transformed into social commentary, anger, and frustration instead of the retro, romanticism of his early years, but as you can see from the outtakes, he was still writing and recording some in that mold as late as 1984. But, again, he had outgrown them, so the nice, romantic &quot;Frankie&quot; gets shelved and the swaggering &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; is banished to B-side purgatory. This is where the pickings get slim, and Bruce nearly hits a brick wall. Most of the last disc is generic sounding. They're not bad, but they cover well-worn territory. If they were musically more compelling, he'd get away with that, but they aren't. They sound generic. Still, &quot;Sad Eyes&quot; creates a nice mood, as does &quot;Happy.&quot; The last track, &quot;Brothers...&quot; (unrelated to the similarly titled song on Disc 3), however, ends the set on a high note. Not a lost classic, but better than anything on the &quot;Tom Joad&quot; album. Just excellent. Had his effective, underrated re-recording of &quot;The Promise&quot; and &quot;Missing&quot; been included here instead of being banished to &quot;18 Tracks&quot; and a Europe-only CD single, respectively, the last quarter would've been so much better. The former is a lost classic (previously recorded in intolerably slow versions), the latter a strong latter day song exploring new ground (done for a movie directed by Sean Penn). &quot;The Fever&quot; should've been here, too (also on &quot;18 Tracks&quot;).<br />Bruce's studio albums from &quot;Wild, Innocent...&quot; to &quot;Tunnel Of Love&quot; are all very good to great. Each one had been called a masterpiece by somebody, and dropping the songs you hear on &quot;Tracks&quot; doesn't hurt them. But, one could have a very respectable career had they recorded the music you hear on &quot;Tracks.&quot;
B00005BL2A|4.0|After twenty years of recording, it's reasonable to assume that any band will encounter a dry spell of sorts, resulting in either laughably bad albums or the demise of the group. For the past ten years, Depeche Mode have sought to avoid that curse by releasing three wildly distinct studio albums: 1990's crystalline Violator, 1993's heavy, distortion-laden Songs Of Faith And Devotion, and the murky Ultra in 1997. And while each of these have been solid albums in their own right, Ultra's absence of a clear direction indicated that perhaps Depeche Mode's time was running out.<br />After a four-year recording absence (save for the release of a new single on their greatest hits package), Depeche Mode have returned with Exciter, an album that displays a newfound sense of energy and optimism. The album's opener (and first single), &quot;Dream On&quot;, is an appetizer for the rest of Exciter, its restrained acoustic guitar and syncopated handclaps giving a taste of the complexity and atmospherics of the rest of the album, due in no small part to producer Mark Bell's creative input. <br />Though by no means the best song on Exciter, &quot;Dream On&quot; is one of DM's better singles in years, and far better than the majority of songs that find their way to modern rock radio. And while songwriter Martin Gore usually opts for love songs tainted with a certain degree of pessimism (&quot;Goodnight Lovers&quot;, &quot;Breathe&quot;), songs such as &quot;Shine&quot;, &quot;Freelove&quot; and the epic &quot;I Am You&quot; reflect an straightforward romantic abandon that gives them a refreshing spin. There's also the dancefloor-friendly &quot;I Feel Loved&quot;, a classic DM dance track given a high-energy infusion of Brazilian percussion. <br />Of course, the album does have its share of low points: the incongruous noise-fest &quot;The Dead Of Night&quot; might have some of the silliest lyrics Gore has ever written, and the two instrumental tracks on the album are so brief that one wonders what their point is. &quot;Easy Tiger&quot;, in particular, might be a good song if it were allowed to breathe past its painfully short two-minute length. &quot;Comatose&quot;, a typical Gore ballad, plods along but never really goes anywhere.<br />Despite these faults, Exciter is a very good album that should satisfy the most critical of DM aficionados and attract a new legion of fans. Far from the last gasp of an aging band, it's the band's creative second wind, and a welcome breath of fresh air at that.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Somber, confrontational, bittersweet, reflective, poignant, hopeless, earnest, progressive, haunting, social, complex...  Radiohead's 6th full release Hail To The Thief is all of these things and more.  <br />Regardless of other factors, the grandeur of a CD really boils down to the songwriting, and the tunes on HTTT show the very same potency that OK Computer, Kid A, and The Bends were imbued with.  Upon the first listen, one can easily recognize the earmarks of progressive writing that so successfully propelled OK Computer.  Also here, albeit more sparingly, are the multi-layered electronic sound-scapes that Kid A and Amnesiac were overwrought with, and it's all wrapped up in a familiar socially conscious bow.  However, unlike the last couple releases, HTTT seems to utilize all of Radiohead's assets without overindulging any of them.  Although there are only 2 tracks to exceed the 5-minute mark, each offering is layered and rich, building upon their established sound.  Here Radiohead manages to weave something different - a collage, more personal, more concentrated, and at times more sublime than ever before.  The movements are as esoteric as ever, and the occasional genius here needs a patient ear.  This, like any other Radiohead CD after The Bends, takes a good half-dozen hearings before all the pieces begin to fit together, and those who may have had difficulty digesting their earlier work are in for a similar process.  However, when they finally do fall into place, like a cosmic epiphany, it's to the ultimate credit of their distinct musicianship and solidarity of vision.  Radiohead challenges us once again to look at ourselves as individuals in a society gone astray, successfully condemning and mourning, while offering a slim margin of redemption simultaneously.  The tracks herein are well-written and varied, taking the listener from the serene little escape raft on an enormous ocean in &quot;Sail To The Moon&quot;, to the angst-ridden, tongue-tied `man in abox' of &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, and many places in between.  It's near 60 minutes of imagery continues the Radiohead tradition by making us think, sometimes too much, about where we are, and more importantly where we're headed as a society.  This release, like a hybrid of OK Computer and Kid A, manages to breech the wide gap between them, directly transporting the listener (like it or not) into uncertainty.  Whether you agree with the politics of the message, which sticks it's neck out further than ever, or not, you can't help but respect the bold position that the band takes. \\"We don't want the loonies taking over.  Tip-toeing, tying down our arms....\\"  And there are still those tracks that seem to retain all of the `humanness' in such a wasteland of satirical rhetoric by exposing inner-turmoil in spite of it all.  This contrast between the harsh sociopolitical scrutiny and a fragile humanity \\"you fell into our arms...\\" makes HTTT one of Radiohead's most responsible and rewarding bodies of work to date.<br />As usual the production (credit Nigel Godrich) is generous, but not the overbearing electronic juggernaut that emerged at times on former CDs.  Here, I believe, Radiohead has struck a perfect balance in their sound using each resource, electronic or otherwise, to compliment the others.  The few tracks that are definitely more synth laden (Sit down. Stand up, Backdrifts, and The Gloaming) appear at intervals where the scope of the CD can accommodate them, and the slower 'ballads' (Sail To The Moon, Go To Sleep, and I Will) balance it all out very nicely. <br />I realize that certain reviews will seriously detract from my praises of Hail To The Thief, but as we all know Radiohead's music isn't for everyone.  If it did strive to merely entertain there would be diminishment, and it would most definitely regress into the crowded halls of mediocrity.  I suggest that anyone listening to this CD give it a few turns, and remember that the whole is absolutely worth morethan the sum of its parts.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Titanic, James Cameron's 1997 hit starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, is one of my favorite romantic movies of all time. This film, set aboard the doomed ocean liner Titanic in April of 1912, is both sad and moving. <BR>The media pundits speculated Cameron's $200 million epic would cause his downfall; signaling the end of blockbusters films and sink Paramount Studios just as fast as the Titanic sunk on April 14, 1912! How wrong they were in that conclusion! Not only were the media pundits  proven wrong, but Titanic made over $1 billion in the global box-office receipts (due to some viewing the movie more than once at the movies). Titanic surpassed all the previous box-office hits to become the number 1 box-office hit of all time.<BR>The movie is a disaster and love story in one, in my opinion. Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), two star-crossed lovers that met on board ship, fell in love and crossed what then were vast class differences. The other actors in the move where great in the parts they played \\"Unsinkable\\" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates),  Cal Hockley, Rose's cold and rude fianc (Billy Zane) and the many others. When you see them going through what they went through you won't come away from watching it dry eyed.<BR> The cinematography was superb, with each scene it was as you were there on board the ship looking and being a part of what was going on from the grand ballroom and dining area in First Class to the crowded and squalid  Third Class steerage where many Irish and other foreign immigrants were going to America hoping for a better life for themselves and their families. <BR>Not only did Titanic win 11 Academy Awards (including Best Picture, Director and Dramatic Score by James Horner), but Titanic's best selling musical score was the first soundtrack to reach the No. 1 slot on the Billboard charts in two decades. Celine Dion's \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" will bring tears to your eyes, making you think of what Rose and Jack were going through as the tragedy unfolds on the ill-fated voyage. This finely honed piece craftsmanship by James Horner who has tackled musically adventuresome projects in his career including scores for Apollo 13, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games and Star Trek II: the Wrath of Khan.<BR>For me, this movie will be an enduring and classic love story for years to come.
0385507755|5.0|I apologize if this review is a bit repetitive, but it is true to say this book is quite addictive.  I could not put it down.  Frey takes you along and puts you inside a place most of us will never see, and allows us to relate to someone with such a profound addiction and the people around him dealing with it, and healing for it.  His unique writing style will surely drive the most strict English professors nuts- but for the rest of us, it is a refreshing take on getting feelings across from the narrator to the reader.  I absolutely recommend this book.
0761119752|5.0|My 14 month old not only loves this book, but now seems to love all books. He started, however, with this one.  He would carry this book over to his mother and me to be read over and over.  We would no sooner finish reading the last page, when he would turn it back to the front cover to be read again. Soon he was carrying other books over to us to read.  When we were not reading to him we would find him in his room paging through this book trying to imitate the sounds we read to him.  I would recommend this book to any new parents looking for a book to spark their childs interest in reading.
B000092ZYX|5.0|As Hail To The Thief pummels my brain for the second time around, I have to say that though this is the most anticipated release (for me) in quite some time, no expectations could have possibly prepared me for the sheer magnificence of this disc.  Every song is instantly memorable, filled with hooks and beautiful aggression.  Every track is different from every other track, and different than anything that Radiohead has previously released.  At the same time, however, EVERYTHING Radiohead has done is represented in this collection (With the exception of Pablo Honey).  Every song will be someone's favorite, every lyric will hit somone somewhere that nothing's touched in awhile, if ever.  This is a masterpiece of music, just as the Beatles Abbey Road represented a culmination of everything they had done before, Hail to the Thief does the same for Radiohead.  All aspects of radiohead are represented here, plus so many new and different sounds that it is mind altering.  Buy this cd, listen to it repeatedly, enjoy it.  Records like this rarely come along.

B00008O0WN|4.0|This is the tenth Star Trek motion picture since the original Star Trek tv series (1966-1969) and Star Trek: The Next Generation (1987-1994).<br />  At a Romulan meeting, Commander Donatra (Dina Meyer) excuses herself from the room when suddenly a thalaron energy disc opens to release a substance when showered over all in attendance, decompose, shatter and die.  All of the Enterprise crew, including Data (Brent Spiner), LaForge (Levar Burton), Worf (Michael Dorn), Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden), Wesley (Will Wheaton), Guinan (Whoopie Goldberg) are in attendance for the wedding reception of Riker (Jonathan Frakes) and Troi (Marina Sirtis). Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) is the host.<br />  Once on the Enterprise E, Picard goes to the surface of Kolarus III and drives in an Argo vehicle.  They find pieces of an android which is another &#34;Data&#34; model (Brent Spiner).  The Kolarans chase after Picard, Data and Worf.<br />  Later, Admiral Janeway (Kate Mulgrew [Mrs. Columbo, 1979]), who has returned to Earth since her Star Trek: Voyager years (1995-2001) invites Picard to Romulas.<br />  Captain's Log Stardate 56844.9:  A Romulan ship, Scimitar, comes into sight and Viceroy (Ron Perlman) awaits them.

B00008YLV2|5.0|\\"Black Hawk Down\\" may be the greatest war movie ever made.  This is not a film that attempts to buoy itself in dubious storylines (such as the otherwise amazing \\"Saving Private Ryan\\") or political statements about the causes that wars are fought for and the inherent goods or evils therein.  \\"Black Hawk Down\\" is an utterly ferocious depiction of urban warfare; a to-the-details accurate recreation of the fiercest firefight that American soldiers had (at the time) been involved in since Vietnam.  This is an absolutely riveting account of the undescribable professionalism and heroism of a relatively small number of American troops pinned on the ground in the middle of an entire city full of armed people who are trying to kill them.  Those who have criticized \\"Black Hawk Down\\" have neglected to appreciate the film's overriding purpose, which is to place the audience right there in the streets with these soldiers as they come under unending enemy fire from every imaginable direction for 18 straight hours.  I have never seen a war film that has done a better job of depicting the utterly hellacious ferociousness of military combat, and therefore created such a deep and lasting appreciation and respect for our country's fighting men and women, what they go through, the sacrifices they endure, the hard-fought victories they win, and the causes they are called on to fight for all over the world.  The movie avoids all the sloganeering that would beat these values over your head, but if you come away from the film without having absorbed them for yourself, then the purpose of the movie has been utterly lost on you.  This is not a movie about stories or morals; it's a movie about the combat experience and what it brings out in those who fight, and by the time it's over, you can only react with tears of sadness... but also of great, great respect.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Just finished listening to Hail To The Thief for the first time. Mixed emotions about it, melancholic to uplifting at times. The lyrics are seemingly powerful, but needs more listening to get used to. I am going to listen to it again, but after peeking inside this cd for about 40 minutes, I am glad I bought it.<br />Right now, I am giving it anywhere from 3.5 to 4 stars - I am sure that will change soon. It's been always that way for me with Radiohead.<br />And kudos for boycotting Clear Channel Corporation. Glad you guys have the backbone to stand up to a bunch of hypocrites.
076790592X|4.0|I read this book based on the recommendations of other members of the cadre. Seemed a little sappy in premise, but it is a book with a 'big heart' and an important message for those who might question some of the central issues in life such as love, aging, materialism and death.<br />The eponymous character, Morrie Schwartz, is a well-loved professor of sociology at Bradeis University. He is renowned for his gentle and caring spirit, and he has touched many individual lives in a way most university professors don't. At the age of 75 he falls ill with ALS, an incurable disease which he knows will end his life slowly and painfully. Despite this condition, he maintains his positive attitude and busy schedule with classes and students and family and friends. As he starts to decline, a friend collects his aphorisms, little snippets of advice and wisdom, into a newspaper column. This column leads to an interview with Ted Koppel on NBC; this national exposure brings his former student, Mitch Albom to to his bedside. <br />Mitch, a graduate of Brandeis and a student of Morrie's, has achieved great success at an early age. He writes a sports column in Detroit, and mingles with talented and wealthy athletes and team owners. He has an incredibly busy schedule flying to sporting events all over the country and he has acquired many of the vestiges of success. But when his unionized co-workers at the Detroit newspaper go on strike, he can't work and has the perfect opportunity to visit with Morrie and talk about life. He begins showing up every Tuesday at Morrie's home, to sit by his bedside and ask Morrie his opinion on topics such as love, marriage, forgiveness, and death. <br />These conversations take place as Morrie declines week by week, his disease slowly creeping up his body. Morrie slowly surrenders to its grasp, becoming utterly dependent on his caregivers to feed, clothe, wash and thump him on the back so he can breathe. Mitch records this process of disintegration with pain and guilt, and is amazed that Morrie still maintains his appointments with friends and even strangers who were touched by his wisdom. Mitch carefully looks at his own life, and you can see him grow as they spend these last days together. At the end of Morrie's life Mitch is feeding him, holding his hand, and rubbing his feet, things which would have been unthinkable to him to do two months before. He is profoundly affected by this relationship.<br />I took a lot away from this book about the mentor-mentee relationship. It started out in the formal educational system, in which Morrie was doing his job teaching Mitch in sociology classes. But it grew into a friendship both at Brandeis and after, as Morrie took the time to talk to Mitch, to have lunch, to give advice and to support. Their relationship grew as they embarked on this book, which Morrie called \\"their project,\\" knowing it would find an audience and bring comfort to others. Mitch as the mentee actively sought out Morrie and steered the conversations to topics which troubled him or interested him. This contradicts what many people might think of these relationships - Morrie certainly had advice and enjoyed giving it, but he also asked questions and listened humbly throughout their many days together. Both gained, as Mitch absorbed Morries' wisdom and applied it to his own experience, and Morrie was loved and comforted in his final days. <br />The truism I got out of this book was about the incredible importance of giving yourself to others. There are times when you would rather be alone, or you think that you don't have the energy to listen to others. But it is the kind of gift that is so easy to give and brings joy to yourself and others. Morrie gave generously of his time and elevated personal relationships to the highest level in his life. He danced every weekend, ate lunch with students and friends, took walks, always expressing his feelings freely to men, women, students and his children and wife.It was a lifetime of this giving that came back to him when he was dying. He even scheduled his own memorial service before he died, so that he could join in the remembrances. <br />This was a wonderful book to read. At times the style is like a newspaper column, with short choppy sentences and paragraphs, but it is clear that this book has an incredible amount of heart. I of course want to know how Mitch lives his life differently because of those Tuesdays with Morrie, but I guess I will have to read his sports column to get a glimpse of his thinking.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I love this CD ! I like all the songs on it but my favorite are Mother &amp; Father, Easy Ride, Nothing Fails, Love Profusion and Hollywood. I don't understand why this Madonna album isn't successful in America, you should be proud of Madonna. The critics say the album is anti-american and anti-patriotic but the lyrics are just ironic. Madonna is a great artist, one of the last real stars in the world. Come on America, buy this CD. May AMERICAN LIFE be successful in the US.
0385504209|5.0|This is one of the most original fiction titles I have read in months -- not only is it spellbinding in terms of plot, but it also raises several important theological questions.  Dan Brown creates believable characters stuck in extraordinary situations that strain credibility at times, but like 17th C French neoclassic playwrights, he keeps the 'unities' of time, action, and place realistic enough to sustain our interest.  The action starts right from the prologue, when Sauniere, a curator at the Louvre, is murdered by a mysterious albino 'monk'.  Realizing that an important secret will die with him, Sauniere stages his own death scene full of clues to the reason behind his murder.  This brings Robert Langdon, a symbologist, into the picture: first a suspect in the murder, then the only man who can truly solve it, Langdon finds himself fleeing through Paris and beyond to solve the clues and exonerate himself.  Langdon is joined by Sophie Neveu, who is revealed to be the granddaughter of Sauniere, and is herself a cryptologist.  The fun of the novel is watching the characters figure out the clues left by Sauniere, a master puzzler in more ways than one.  The big 'secret' everyone -- good and bad -- wishes to find is based in current theological debates on the nature of Christianity and the role of women in the church.  Although the end seems a bit rushed and almost too neat (intellectually, not emotionally), this is truly a \\"I can't put it down\\" novel.  Definitely worth reading.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I followed Radiohead after a friend of mine turned me onto them, I started with OK Computer and began to move backwards to catch up on what I missed. It was great, Pablo Honey, and the Bends are two fantastic albums, then I moved onto Kid A. The idea of a CD that I had to get used to didn't appeal to me, and when I first heard the title track appropriately labelled &quot;Kid A&quot; I cringed at it. But after 5 or 6 spins in my CD player I got used to the clicks and strange noises that really inhabited the CD more than words, but I've always remained much more partial to OK Computer.<br />Not anymore, Hail To The Thief is FANTASTIC! Radiohead has progressed slowly to experimental for quite sometime now and I can safely say that now they're moving backwards to around OK Computer. This CD is a second OK Computer with a little bit of Kid A thrown in. This is where the band's balance should be, opening with a traditional rock song &quot;2+2=5&quot; and moving onto the quiet sweeping ballads &quot;Sail To The Moon&quot; (which is my favorite on the CD) this CD is right where it needs to be and I hope Radiohead stays here, because this is how gold is made.
B00000ICD9|5.0|This is by far my favorite movie ever!  It is sooooo good, it's what I think everyone dreams of what \\"heaven\\" should be like after they die.  This movie is so visually appealing and beautiful with wonderful actors and actresses.  It is so sad though, it will bring tears to anyone's eyes I'm sure.  So I encourage anyone to go rent and see it.  It's well worth it and then if you like it as much as I do, buy it, I did and I couldn't be happier.  And I can't stress this enough: it's a [good] movie!!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Like many great bands, Radiohead is one whose career is marked by a progression of musical styles as their albums go on: from traditional rock-driven simplicity, to groundbreaking meditations on technology, to anti-mainstream experiments in discordant noise and mixed musical backgrounds. Their latest effort, 'Hail to the Thief', presents yet another unique part to their repertoire, that stands alone on many levels but also acts as a melting pot of these past albums and forms. <br />'Hail to the Thief' first stands as a continuation of Radiohead's previous two releases, 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac'. At its strongest points, it is driven by the blend of sleepy piano, raucous guitar, and the synthesized drumbeats that have contributed to the success of the most recent albums. The techno-driven beats of \\"Backdrifts\\" and \\"The Gloaming\\" remind the listener of \\"Idioteque\\" or \\"Packd Like Sardines in a Crushd Tin Box.\\" The band's earlier albums also bring their unique characteristics into play: the guitar-driven \\"Go to Sleep\\" sounds like it came straight off 'The Bends', along with \\"Myxomatosis\\" and its wicked, adrenaline-charged bass riff. Even though \\"We Suck Young Blood,\\" one of the album's best cuts, starts as a humming dirge, its crash toward a piano-heavy climax is thrilling, and allows bandleader Thom Yorke to manipulate his vocal talents to their utmost level. <br />This struggle of reconciliation between the hard and soft sounds of Radiohead hints at its inherent vulnerability-a good part of what sets it apart from other bands. \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" is a gorgeous, complex song; Yorke's at-first emotionless vocals are brought to a new intensity with synthetic instrumentals and the album's focus on singing just as much as that which backs it up. It is apparent that 'Hail to the Thief', much more than past albums, uses Yorke to bring even more depth to its songs as he provides them with both harmonies and melodies. And they meld perfectly: his voice soars on the more muted, orchestral pieces such as \\"Sail to the Moon\\" and \\"I Will\\" (during which, amidst the band's characteristic political thoughts--this time of nuclear fallout--Yorke's voice is at its strongest yet most delicate when he quietly wails, \\"I won't let this happen to my children\\").<br />To argue with Yorke's claim in the album's first single, \\"There There\\"-\\"just 'cause you feel it doesn't mean it's there\\"-there is *much* below the surface of 'Hail to the Thief'. It is not another 'Amnesiac'; nor does it abandon everything the band has done in the past few years and return to the simpler days of 'The Bends'. Rather, it is a combination of Radiohead's past, as well as another strong impetus toward continued future innovations and success.
B00005RJ1U|5.0|Oh my gosh, this movie was soooo hilarious!  I loved it.  I usually don't like &quot;scary&quot; movies because they're boring to me, but this one is worth seeing just because it's so funny!  There's a part where the monster has to hobble to the police station and that is the absolute best!  The movie has a bad ending, a not very good plot line (in my opinion), and is so not scary at all, but I would encourage anyone who is not scared by &quot;scary&quot; movies to see it for all the laughs it will be sure to bring!
6303402348|3.0|I just intellectually could not suspend all that would be required in order to enjoy this. The basic motif of inserting Gump into all these actual events annoyed me. And then seeing it take place over and over just exacerbated my annoyance greatly. Few movies as nice as this one bothered me as much as this one. <br />So, to go from the subjective to the objective, I'd like to suggest that this doesn't have *universal* appeal. It is a very distinctive movie, with a unique structure and content. And if it *is* your cup of tea, great. But if as you're reading about it, a little voice inside is getting annoyed, listen to that voice. For some of us, it just doesn't get us there.
0393314804|5.0|If you truely want a book that will entertain you as well as shock the hell out of you, this may be the book for you. In this book Irvine Welsh takes an uncomfortably close look at the dark side of the human spirit as well as friendship, with one of the most vulgar and cynical texts that I have ever read. But if your wondering if this takes away from the story, let me assure that it only enhances it. This book has the type of humor that will cause you extreme guilt after laughing. I would certainly not recommend this book to everyone but I have yet to read a more facinating book. Irvine Welsh is a master of dialect and his dialogue is nothing short of brilliant. I would imagine that Mr. Welsh is probably a very good listener.
B00004YYDI|5.0|This is the story of Leon(Jean Reno), the highly efficient contract killer who's known as a cleaner due to his ability to kill you without you ever knowing he's there.  He's cold blooded, but at the same time lovable due to his obvious innocence, seen as he affectionatly waters his plant and his love for milk.  He lives a loners life until he meets Matilda(Natalie Portman), who was soon to change his life.  Luckily for Matilda, she was running an errand for Leon while the corrupt villian and lead antagonist of the movie Normon Stansfield(Gary Oldman), and his group of thugs decide to wipe out her entire family, due to some drugs, which were cut by her father while he was supposed to be just holding them.  When Matilda returns, she finds that her family is dead and turns to Leon for help.<BR>  <BR>   When Matilda learns what Leon's trade is, she is intrigued, and convinces the reluctant Leon to teach her the ways of the cleaner.  As Leon trains Matilda, their relationship grows, and to the dismay of Leon, she develops a crush on him, while at the same time he develops a paternal love for her.  This is a great movie, from the action packed beginning, to the thrilling climax.<br />     I definately feel that the uncut DVD version is better than the original version.  It let's you see more deeply into the relationship between Leon and Matilda, and you get to see more of the \\"training\\" scenes, which show how Matilda develops from an unknowing child to a novice cleaner.<br />     I'd also like to say something to the prudes out there that feel the relationship between Leon and Matilda is perverted.  You see it as a sick man trying to take advantage of a young girl, but if you recall, it was Matilda who continually came on to Leon. Leon clearly tells her in one scene that a sexual relationship is not possible.  And even then, it should be clear to anyone that Leon loves Matilda in a way that a father would love his daughter.  I can clearly see this and I'm only 14.  Apparently, there are a lot of low IQ people out there.  The UNCUT, INTERNATIONAL version is the way to go if you want to see a more meaningful, touching movie.  I'm a very cold person at heart, and this is the only movie I've ever watched that made tears swell up in my eyes. It's the greatest movie I've ever seen.  It features a brilliant cast, and a touching, and very unique storyline.
B000092ZYY|4.0|After listening through the album non stop for the past day now I can't say that there is one track that sticks out at me.  Overall this is a really good album.  Hail to the Theif feels like a mix between a toned down Amnesiac and The Bends.  There is still that ambiant feeling with the vocals from the older albums.
B000092ZYX|5.0|So I rushed out to the store in town.  I got there around 11:45 AM, and the UPS guy hadn't come with their shipment of the new Radiohead album.  The guy behind the counter said that they should be getting it in any minute, so I waited.  And waited.  I looked around the rest of the mall before I came back, and finally, after a short while, a line of customers were standing behind me waitin' for the CD to come in the door.  The UPS driver finally arrived, the guy behind the counter ripped open the box, and everyone in the line (myself included) said, &quot;oooOOOOoooo.&quot;  The album was in my hands, I shoved it into my car's stereo and drove for over an hour just to listen to the album once through interrupted.  And man, it's spectacular.<BR>I apologize for my long-winded review, but let me assure you, this album was worth the wait.  Radiohead's musicality is spectacular... Their fantastic layering of sound makes for an incredible depth in their songs, which you'll find that you'll keep playing over and over again.  In terms of style, this album lies somewhere between &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot;, combining the best of both to create their most richly layered work to date.  Radiohead really cranked this album out in a short period of time, and while some reviews have argued that one or two more of Thom Yorke's trademark &quot;wails&quot; into the microphone could have been added, this album feels much more intuitive, much more gutteral than cerebral.  Point being, it's incredibly moving as well as being, well, fun.  It's a fantastic piece of work... Radiohead's albums are ALBUMS, and not just a collection of music where there's one or two songs you like and you can throw away the rest.  You can't easily listen to just one song in &quot;Thief,&quot; you just have to hear it all the way through.  Finally, it's important to note that, while being very politically-charged, this album personalizes its politics.  It's not quite so abstract... It's aboutfacing an absurd outside world, and yet finding no refuge in isolation, either.  You can't hide from the world to be safe from it.  This album is possibly my favorite of theirs: it's more mature in its subject and its emotions, it's musicality is fantastic... In short, it's bitchin'.  I hope y'all enjoy it!
B000089RVX|5.0|It's great to hear a strong voice with soul again!  This band has a great rock sound with powerful lyrics.  They're a cross between Sarah MacLaughlin and Fuel.  They're awesome!!
B000002J09|5.0|I see we have two extremely negative reviewers with a lot of support behind them, and it's very sad to see such.  I think both of them need to wake up and realize two things: they're not the center of the universe, and just because they don't personally like the music doesn't mean the music itself is inherently bad.  That's right: there are other human beings on this planet too, and they like other things than you.  Surprise!<br />I'm going to keep it fairly simple: it's all about taste.  People that rant and rave about what is \\"real music\\" and overtly attack others' musical preferences with negativity and insults have either a): a hard time maturing, or b): no heart.  A lot of today's kids need to awaken to a sense of reality.  Just because the sounds that grace your ear aren't always filled with a feral or angry quality that doesn't mean it's not Rock.<br />That aside, I'll comment on the album!  When I was 14 I first listened to Zeppelin IV, borrowing it from my dad.  Little else to say, really: it took me off the path from the &quot;MTV music&quot; and onto the music of the 60s and 70s, from Pink Floyd to The Beatles and Nirvana and so much more.  In short, it's the album that changed my life, music-wise.  I strongly advise anyone who wants to experience 70s rock fully epitomized and at its zenith to go pick up this album.  And never forget your music history: Led Zeppelin was the beginning--the Tolkien of hard rock . . . the grandfathers of hard rock--the ones who made it okay to play hard rock on mainstream radio, the ones who influenced a genre forever.<br />It's okay to not like Zeppelin's music!  It's all opinion, all right?  Just never mind that--just, I'm asking you, at least, show a little *humanity* and some *respect* toward the artists and their accomplishments.  Because as far as Zeppelin goes: they affect all music, as The Beatles do, and there is no denying that fact.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Secretary is captivating from start to finish. I must admit I heard rumors about how it was just about S&amp;M and how strange it was. But my curiosity got the best of me so I decided to see for myself what all the hype was about and let me just say I was glad I did. This movie was brilliant! <BR>The character of Maggie was so richly portrayed as was the Mr. Grey character. In the beginning you sympathize with Maggie but as the movie continues you become enlightened to see the strong but submissively confident person she becomes. She starts off doing what other people want her to do (like dating the nice but completely wrong guy!)but through Edward she realizes who she wants to be. It is a completely genuine love story about two lonely troubled people whose common bond blossoms into true love. Do not watch this film unless you are going to have an open mind. I think it is possibly one of the best films of the year!
B00008WG3U|5.0|many of theses pop bands today that have thrown the word punk after pop have desecrated the punk music un-industry. NOFX started out with songs about beer bongs and straight-edgers, politics and fat lesbians, and you get at least three out of the four here. And, of course, don't forget the signature, ingenious puns. I think these guys are one of the only bands to be able to criticize Reagan, Clinton, AND two different Bushes during their respective terms. All in all, this is a great album. If you have heard no other NOFX, check out \\"White Trash, Two Heebs, and a Bean,\\" or \\"Heavy Petting Zoo.\\"
B00008RH3L|5.0|Easily Coens' masterpiece...strewn with fascinating argot (&quot;Whats the rumpus?&quot;,  &quot;Always with the high hat&quot;), breathtaking cliffhangers and plot about-turns, one of the BEST action sequences ever filmed with 'Danny Boy' in the backdrop (at par with the Val Kilmer/De Niro/Pacino cameo in &quot;Heat&quot;), and despite never quite having amassed the epic acclaim of &quot;Godfather&quot;, an absolutely exquisite, wholesome treat.<br />Even as a straightlaced gansta flick, it rocks. But beyond that at a deeper level, the movie is an exquisite narrative of more sapient themes such as personal ethics, chance, destiny, and one's command over one's own life -- particulary in the brilliant denouement that happens between Byrne's and Finney's characters.<br />Given the near-classic status this movie enjoys, one would have expected a lot more from a DVD though -- especially after we were made to wait for so long! At the very least, interviews with the Coens or some of the characters were in order. Is &quot;Criterion&quot; listening?
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I knew VERY shortly after I put this cd in the player that I was going to LOVE it! I've been listening to Godsmack from the beginning, and you can see sooo much growth from them with this album! The songs are in-depth, and melodic, without losing that tribal/hardcore metal edge that makes it Godsmack! I've had the cd since the day it came out. (april 8th, 2003) and it still hasn't left my cd player...I love it! It has everything! Groove, thrash metal, tribal, just anything you want from a great disc, this one has it! I would (and do) recommend it to anyone and everyone. It ROCKS!
B00001U0E1|5.0|There's nothing about this movie that I can criticize.  The acting is perfect, and there are dozens of &quot;inside jokes&quot; that will only be noticed by avid Shakespeare scholars like myself.  Even if you're not well-versed in the Bard, however, you'll love the movie: it's a beautiful love story that always succeeds in making me cry at the end no matter how many times I see it!
B000093NLH|5.0|I was a tad behind in my Scorpions collection and had not bought the regular edition of Acoustica yet. Imagine my surprise when the Official Scorpions web site sent me an image, track listing and link to this Platinum Edition. Of course the link was to Amazon.com and the price was reasonable.<br />Well, I must say I am impressed. It's a cool 2 CD set in a slip box. It was made in Thailand. Yes, the imprint on the back is Warner Music Thailand and the video footage was shot by a Thai television film crew.<br />The 43:20 second video played great on my Windows Media Player9. It's a DAT file and you it's not like Quick Time or RP vids.<br />That being said the video has astounding quality and sound. OH! I also was able to play disc 2 in my RCA DVD Player. Most Excellent!<br />The interview with (only 2 members of) The Scorpions is in English with Thai Sub-titles. At times the interviewer speaks to the audience in Thai so what he is saying is lost on us.<br />That being said the performance footage is fantastic. The interview is good. This was filmed in Portugal in Feb 2001 when Acoustica was being done. There is a lot of behind the scense footage. It's a real treat for the fans.<br />The Scorpions used extra musicians for the 'Acoustica' shows. A (nationally known) Cellist from Portugal, a keyboardist, some extra guitars and three back-up singers!. The songs are given carefulo new arrangements. Even a hard number like 'The Zoo' works well in this setting.<br />(The Scorpions played 3 Acoustica shows in early Feb, 2001. Most nights featured over 20-25 songs. With this set you get 18.)<br />A cool cover song is Kansas' \\"Dust In The Wind\\". I really enjoyed it being in this set list, but I am not a fan of Kansas. A 2nd surprise cover song is \\"Drive\\". Yes, this is the song from The Cars. 'Acoustica' was done not long after the death of Cars guitarist/vocalist Ben Orr. Who knew the Scorps were fans? A nice tribute and one of the videos on disc 2. Of course All the Scorpion's Best Known Ballads are here and a few news songs.<br />IF you are a Scorpions fan YOU must buy this set. It's excellent.<br />IF you are a casual Scorpions fan I think you will enjoy this set MORE than a \\"Best Of\\" album. It's easy on the ears and the video footage is superb.<br />The 3 bonus audio tracks on disc 2 are also Top Notch!<br />Rock on Scorpions!<br />[One disappointment I have is that it is mentioned in the interview and behind the scenes footage that \\"Catch Your Train\\" was performed! I would rather have heard an acoustic version of that than say Hurricane 2001. This song hasn't been played live in years (if at all).]<br />Note: Amazon's track listing above is INCORRECT.<br />HERE is the actual track listing:<br />Disc 1: 1. The Zoo 2. Always Somewhere 3.

B000002H2H|5.0|I never thought I'd hear a biblical reference from metal's Four Horseman of the Apocalypse, but \\"Creeping Death\\" is just that.  With songs about dieing and Punishment, Ride the Lightning is one of early Metallica's greatest attempts at ruling the world.
B000092ZYY|5.0|I have followed Radiohead's musical progression since &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;.  Each of their albums has progressed in it's musical acuity tenfold over it's predecessor.  &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is no exception.  To me, this album seems to be a transitional album for these great musicians.  It is definitely not a straight-up prog rock album like OK Computer.  However, it is also not a electronic/techno/ambient album like Kid A and Amnesiac, two albums which took me several listens before I could appreciate them.  &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; seems to combine elements of older Radiohead with their newer elements, and does so very successfully.  Some of the tracks that really stand out are &quot;Where I end and you begin&quot;, &quot;Myxomatosis&quot; (probably one of the more interesting tracks on the album) and the single &quot;There There&quot;, which although it is the most radio-friendly track on the album, is still very unique in and of itself.  I had resisted downloading any tracks off this album before it came out for the sole purpose of listening to it for the first time without any preconceived ideas.  I had heard from other fans that it would take a few listens to actually like the album, but I did not find this to be true.  It will take several listens to pick up on some of the nuances I missed before, however, a task I look forward to!
B000002H33|5.0|With the final appearance of bassist Cliff Burton, Master of Puppets is a thunderous showing of what these guys were(and still are)capable of.  The only spoiler to this album is the knowledge of what they dealt with after it was completed.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Those looking for some common ground between OK Computer and Kid A should be very very pleased with Hail To The Thief. The album is just as dark and brooding as Kid A in many spots. However, it still manages to maintain some of the elements that made OK Computer so special: excellent song writing and guitar work. <br />The political innuendos are there but they aren't always obvious. Someone who disagrees with Radiohead's always outspoken political beliefs could still enjoy this album. <br />Clearly, Radiohead is in a league of their own and are incredibly driven and committed to pour themselves into every album they release. This is a good thing in an age of such strong commercialism and recycled music that seems to be progressing nowhere. <br />Buy this album and let Radiohead expand your musical horizons even further.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I can't write a review that hasn't already been written yet- I'm not talking about the ones bashing Christina, I'm talking about the five star ones. I CAN tell you I was incredibly impressed by this cd. Finally a pop star has come out with something with a little more edge and a little more soul. Something from the heart. I read some reviews saying Christina should get over her abused childhood- and I was incredibly angry. It's not something you can casually throw aside. Of course, so many people who review here are incredibly ignorant and wouldn't have the brains to know any better. Growing up, I went through the same as Christina did, if not worse. When I first listened  to \\"I'm Okay,\\" I nearly started crying. I think it's so great that she could come out and sing about that, you cannot possibly understand how hard it is to talk about having grown up in home where there is/was domestic violence. So no, she shouldn't shut up about it, and for this, I have so much respect for her.  Not only is she truthful, but she comes out with some great songs that are not only empowering but have great beats. \\"Fighter\\", \\"Infatuation\\",\\"Beautiful\\" \\"Make Me Over\\" and \\"I'm Okay\\" are just SOME of the standout tracks. I don't usually buy pop cd's because alot of it is ..., but Christina Aguilera actually has a voice and is laying herself out on the table for us. If you want a cd with variety and one you'll never get tired of, buy this one. It will be worth it, trust me.
0375422307|5.0|If you enjoyed Art Spiegelmen's Maus or Joe Sacco's Palestine, you are sure to enjoy Marjane Sartrapi's Persepolis.  The story telling is bold first persson, and the drawings are stark and  striking in their pure black and white sympathy.<br />I cannot wait until the sequel is translated into English.
B00003CX5P|2.0|The hopes of Episode 1 fell quickly. This movie truly was rushed, and had no patient hands or minds. A moment of interesting starts, the federation was cutting all access to the planet of Naboo, and then starting the conflict. Liam Neeson, a super actor, looked and seemed good, yet failed to impress me as a legendary Jedi. He was flat, not very characteristic. Too many stop and go things with him. He still was the part, just not outwards. Ewan McGregor was the perfect pic as Obi-wan. Again, here was a problem. It wasn't him, no. He was very underused. The script he was able to work with, well, he did a good job at<BR>keeping whatever was workable in this very uninteresting story. <BR>And ya, Jar-Jar, go away. The Vice Roys are nothing but a bunch of cowardly overgrown guppies out of water...hahaha....and why the heck were they in this movie? I understand a cowardly villan was ok, but three of them? Where was the Menace (Maul) for the majority? Oh, here and there. Coward federation guppies! <br />\\"Seal off the bridge!\\" <BR>\\"Close the Blast Doors!\\" <BR>\\"Where are those Droidikas?!\\" <BR>\\"Send in the droid.\\" <BR>\\"I-dont-I don't know-\\"<BR>\\"They're still coming through!\\"<br />Cowards!<br /> 2 most disapointing details, are:<BR> <BR> Anakin (Jake Lloyd) should not have been picked for this film/part. He talks like a Nickelodeon show kid who you see on Saturday morning (cool, totally awesome, whoa!...stuff like that) and has no acting skills, and says, \\"This is tense!\\", or anything a kid from those morinig shows would say. This is Star wars, NOT Nickelodeon! If only Elijah Wood was young enough to play his part-see him as a kid? He is an actor ! <BR>very tense, fun, and great acting. <br /> Why droids? Whatever happened to men fighting men? troopers vs. Gungans or Naboo people-that'd be better.....not....droids, droids....yawn. <br />\\"Roger, roger.....\\"<BR>\\"Uh oh.....blast 'em!\\"<BR>\\"Halt-freeze! Uh, does not compute.....ZZZZZ....ZZZzzap....fzzzz.\\"<br />Geese....., stupid droids.<br />Effects are good, and so is the best sabre duel scene ever. <BR>Oh. Why bring back R2 and C3P0? So what is they were loved....i like 'em, but again? They should have made 2 other droids....too lazy and selling out....they thought without R2 and C3, this movie would sink. No. I'd love to see original droids. marketing....geeze. <br />Watto is hilarious!!<br />\\"MMMMMM....yes -NUBIAN....MMMMM\\"<br />And the meazly space battle was borrrring. Droid fighters? Wow...ooooh-scary......lol<br />What a waste. <br />Natalie Portman keeps becoming royal english accent, then loses it, gains it, loses it......
B000000HSU|5.0|Bad Brains is a classic, immensely talented, frenetic hardcore band (...), and \\"Rock For Light\\" is arguably their best release (although I probably prefer the more punkish \\"Black Dots\\" album a slight bit more).  I know a lot of folks prefer the self-titled release to this, but I have never understood that.  RFL is so much more diverse, with a handful of great reggae songs and some wonderful \\"pop-core\\" (the title track and \\"At the Movies,\\" for instance).  The song selection, for sure, is far superior to that of the self-titled release (including the already-mentioned \\"Rock for Light\\" and \\"At the Movies,\\" as well as \\"Coptic Times,\\" \\"How Low Can A Punk Get,\\" \\"Joshua's Song,\\" and \\"Riot Squad\\").  My one complaint is that I take great umbrage with Darryl's decision to resequence the track order on the Caroline CD.  The new tracking blows and completely ruins the flow of the album.  For those of you who really want to experience the greatness of this album, reprogram the tracking as follows:  <br />Coptic Times (the perfect opener)/attitude/we will not/sailin' on/rally around jah throne/right brigade/f.v.k./riot squad/the meek shall inherit the earth/joshua's song/banned in d.c./how low can a punk get?/big takeover/i&i survive/destroy babylon/rock for light/at the movies  (you can add the three bonus tracks at the end -- supertouch/I/jam)
B000092ZYY|5.0|Anyone who's ever wished there would be a band to defy trends, ignore musical boundaries, or simply just write good songs can finally sleep tonite. or can they?.....dum dum dum...!!!!The most thought provoking band in 30 years has just released the most thought provoking album in 30 years with enough of everything you want out of radiohead and everything to keep you awake listening to it over and over. Anyone who ever denied them their place among the sculpters and innovaters of rock and pop music should only look back now and see all their clones lost in the dust of sophistication anmd literature.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This is a another good Radiohead album, that ranks up there with their catalog.  Although they may never eclipse the masterpiece Ok Computer from 1997, the band continues to release quality album after after album. The opener &quot;2+2=5&quot; is great way to start with a catchy guitar line and infectious melody. HTTT is an album that is hard to sing along with, but one that you will want to listen to over and over again. There are still electronica tracks like &quot;Backdrifts&quot; and &quot;The Gloaming&quot;, but the best songs are those that have more pop leanings such as radio single &quot;There There&quot; and &quot;Where I end and you begin&quot;.  The majestic &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot;, is reason enough to buy this album, but there are many great songs.  Radiohead always produce great music and songs and HTTT is no exception to the rule. I would enjoy this pop record for the time being, because knowing Radiohead their bound to evolve next time around. Hail to the Thief!
0553288105|4.0|To any reader of science fiction, Isaac Asimov is an old familiar. Not only did he create the three laws of robotics and 'Foundation', his name also presides over countless anthologies, awards, and one long running magazine. Unlike many of his contemporaries, people continue to read Asimov. The ideas are still engaging, the characters still 'typed-up' well enough to resemble people we might know - or be interested in knowing, and the writing still crisp and relatively free of all the dating that's so heavily sprinkled in other works from the sixties and seventies. In 'The Gods Themselves', Asimov deals not only with a people more like us, but a people much closer to us in time. This novel does not take place in a galaxy far far away (at least two thirds of it don't), but in one very close to now. Secondly, Asimov deals with chemistry (sprinkled heavily with some quantum mechanics), which was the field he pursued as a scientist - despite being one of the fathers of robotics. <br />The story plays out in three almost completely distinct parts. A common practice with Asimov. Many of his novels, including the first two 'Foundation' books actually consisted of several novellas stringed together. These parts consist of characters - talking heads really - struggling for or against the new technology Asimov has created to serve as the plot device: the electron pump. However negative such a simple description may sound, the application of it to paper is beautiful. The electron pump itself is such an engaging scientific concept, it draws the characters toward inexorable toward it. Much of the talking-head criticism stems from the necessity for the characters, in dialogue, to explain certain scientific principles in order to elucidate for the reader just what the heck they're talking about. Part Two (and the titular part): &quot;...The Gods Themselves...&quot; might perhaps be the most brilliant alien creating I've ever read. The aliens not only have more character and personality than most of Asimov's human creations (maybe Asimov was alien?), but they somehow come across as completely alien and completely recognizable. It's a remarkable feat, and is almost disappointing that it doesn't end the book. Alas, part three is a necessity.<br />Anyone who loves Asimov and likes real 'science' fiction - not space opera or fantasy - could do a lot worse than this one. In fact, they'd be hard pressed to do better.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Thom Yorke has been quoted as saying that this album is the band`s return to OK Computer territory, but that the next album wont be `The Bends', rather something `completely unrecognizable`. So, is this album OK Computer revisted? It certainly starts off in rocking form, with the superbly catchy `2+2=5`. However, from there, blips and bleeps reminiscent of the more recent albums are introduced, and the sad piano with the odd chord changes coupled with Yorke`s near whine, show this isn`t going to be a complete return. I think Kid A was great, but Amnesiac perhaps too similar to it. This is an album showing that the band have grown. They`ve combined the more adventurous experimentation of the last two albums with more classic pop songwriting structures, to come up with an interesting album that is definately not short on hooks. Just slightly different hooks from the norm. Standouts include 'Where I end and you begin', with haunting keyboards reminiscent of Talk Talk's 'Colour of Spring' album, as well as the excellent single 'There There'. Perhaps they`ve been listening to Pere Ubu a lot recently too, because the warbling voices and angular guitar on the opening track certainly remind of those American indie heroes. As for the next album, who knows what Yorke means by 'unrecognisable', but for now Radiohead are both going back and moving forward at the same time. Near-perfect paradoxical pop.
B000092ZYX|5.0|If we are to believe Thom Yorke this will be the last album that sounds like the OK COMPUTER era Radiohead.  That's sad because that will be the era that everyone remembers the band at its peak.  Hail to the Thief is an exceptional album that delivers what Kid A and Amnesiac promised.  It's the right mix of trippy beats and spacey guitars.<br />Right off the bat on &quot;2+2=5&quot;  we hear the awesome guitar licks that made OK COMPUTER an instant classic.  There are greats songs on the record including &quot;Go to Sleep,&quot; &quot;Where I End and You Begin,&quot; &quot;There There,&quot; and &quot;A Wolf at the Door.&quot;  The only area of the album that drags a bit is &quot;The Gloaming.&quot;<br />For fans who wanted a carbon copy of OK COMPUTER or the The Bends they may be disappointed, but this is easily more accessible than Kid A and Amnesiac (both albums I enjoyed).  Radiohead is still by far the preeminent rock act right now.  All others fall short.
0783229526|1.0|... but this one just hits the bottom!<br />After reading about it: the cast, Gilliam, etc. I thought that it should be a good movie, but oh, what a disappointment...<br />Drug use and abuse is no good, that's what the movie keeps shouting all the time.<br />Images are weird (druggy), acting is weird (druggy), plot is weird (druggy), etc.<br />I have no doubts lots of people will like it (as some reviewers adore it), but not me.<br />I love strange movies (\\"Mulholland Dr.\\", \\"Memento\\", \\"The Wall\\", \\"Pi\\", \\"Delicatessen\\", etc), but this one was just over the top.<br />You really need to be in the mood to watch it.<br />It's not your popcorn-kind of movie.
B00004XMTH|5.0|The musical CATS will forever be one of the true greats of musical theatre. The video is the next best thing to seeing it live. I watch the video so muc, the tape might wear out soon.

B000003Z6I|5.0|This album is divine for its storming and pounding. We have strong evidence here Cave is the last great romantic poet. The music focuses on a kinetic and roiling set of rhythms over which Cave sings his dirges. My favorite is &quot;Wings of Flies&quot; which has some pretty darkly humorous imagery (&quot;she loves me, she loves me not!&quot;) as well as an adolescent flare.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I was hoping this album would see a return to the form of OK Computer or The Bends (though to even come close to equalling those two superb albums would be amazing) so was quite disappointed when I first listened to this album.<br /><br />While it is not as experimental as \\"Kid A\\" or \\"Amnesiac\\", thank goodness, it still has quite a few tracks that could be straight out of those two albums, complete with random noises and unintelligible or pointless lyrics. However, there are a few tracks that are reminders of the good old days: \\"There There\\" (by far the best track on the album), \\"Where I end and you begin\\", \\"2+2=5\\" and \\"A punchup at a wedding\\"<br /><br />The songs that fall somewhere between the good stuff and the experimental stuff tend to grow on you though, so if the stuff that is reminiscent of Kid A (buzzing noise and pointless lyrics) is ignored, this album is pretty good, rather than just average.
B000067CPX|5.0|Definitely a must have for any fan of the band!  A return to their earlier styles does suit them well.  I don't even find myself skipping through songs, I want to listen to them all.

B00008LDPU|2.0|This DVD contains 9 different short stories drawn by different artists.  In some cases, I liked the animation, and in others I disliked it.  I found the drastic changes in the artists' style to be distracting at best.  But this is a matter of personal taste.  I was really disappointed and a little annoyed by this collection because the stories themselves seemed trivial and sometimes incomplete.  At the end of many of them I thought so what?  Nothing of substance occurred and there seemed to be no point to many of them.  Much like the Enter the Matrix video game (which I also own and am disappointed with), the Animatrix felt like a cheap grab for more of my money.  It seemed hastily written and slapped together just to squeeze out a few more bucks from me.  While I sort of liked Matrix Reloaded, I think the release of that movie coupled with the video game and the animated stories was overly commercial and really diminished my enthusiasm for Revolutions and my overall opinion of the Matrix storyline.  The Animatrix should have just been included on the Matrix Reloaded DVD for free when it is released.  I would not waste your money on this one.
B00008PC2O|4.0|If your interested in the real differences from a technical perspective then here it goes:<br />The ultimate Edition DVD that has been out for about a year now has the best special features and extras. <br />The new just released EXTREME EDITION, the very DVD on this page, has the best picture and sound possible from the source material. The developers have gone back and copied the original source in extremely high resolution, of course your average TV can only get a fraction of the resolution this is actually displaying but High Definition TV can see it in all its glory. So in reality this DVD was made for the future high definition DVD players and HDTV systems that will be released probably within the next 3 years. <br />The EXTREME edition does have the best picture and sound because the bit-rates are much higher than the Ultimate Edition. But because of this the DVD can not hold as much extra features and such. The Extreme Edition does feature the first EVER James Cameron commentary on T2, and it is exceptionally interesting stuff! If you don't own the Ultimate Edition then this Extreme Edition is definitely worth it. But if you do own the Ultimate Edition, you probably would be fine without this DVD unless you absolutely must have the best experience possible regardless of special features or you are a collector or extreme fan of the series. Think of this edition as a companion to your Ultimate Edition.
B000001IPP|5.0|This is by far my fav Rancid CD since I heard it back in '94...I wasnt able to take it out of my cd player for weeks. And now 9 years later I still listen to it. Its catchy as hell...I love it!
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is the best album I've heard so far this year.  I like it better than the new White Stipes album, but they are completely different types of albums.  The album is a mix of all the sounds Radiohead has indulged in over their career.  From straight up rock tracks like 2+2=5 and There, There to electronic driven songs like Sit down, Stand Up and Backdrifts.  One thing I like about this album, is when Radiohead go electronic, they are more song structured than Kid A's electronic tracks were.  My favorite tracks are 2+2=5, Sit Down, Stand Up, Sail to the Moon, Go to Sleep, There, There, I Will, A Punchup at a Wedding, and A Wolf at the Door, but I enjoy all of the songs.  A Wolf at the Door is one of the coolest songs I've ever heard.  Anyone who enjoys any Radiohead album should pick this one up.
0316548189|5.0|'Long walk to freedom' is a book that doesn't take you long to read it. It's one of the most interesting autobiographies you ever got to read. It's definitely written beautifully and it is so vivid and enjoyable. What makes this person so adorable and a hero is the way he tackled the most difficult situations with ease, even in his book he didn't make such a big fuss about his <BR>sufferings and tough times he had to go through.<br />This book includes 10 parts, and the eleven-th one is the part of FREEDOM.<br />A country childhood - in which he recalls his childhood days so vividly.<br />Johannesburg - he runs away from regend (foster parent) after he arranges a marriage for him with a girl who was in love with the regend's son.<br />Birth of a freedom fighter - his liberation struggles begin here...<br />and so on...<br />A remarkable book - from which not that I have seen one man's struggles for FREEDOM, but also learned a lot of things - that are most useful in everyday 'civilised' world!!!

B00005JLPK|5.0|All I can say is after viewing this film, I cannot understand why Hollywood does not embrace Salma more! She's stunningly beautiful and a multi-talented actress to boot!<br />Thank God it was her that brought this film to life and not some of the others who had plans for it like Madonna! Good God! I could imagine what she would have done to this story!<br />But Salma should be congratulated for having the chutzpa to persist with her dream and vision! She gave us a winner. I saw this when it was in the theatre, and was truly moved by it.<br />The story of Frida is a beautful tragic one and it's told perfectly here. The colors are rich. The blends of Frida's paintings, particularly at the end, make the viewer really understand the pain that Frida felt in her body, and how it transferred itself to the canvas!<br />I'm so glad this film got made! Do yourself a favor and get this film! You will not be sorry!
B00008J4P5|5.0|I will admit I like many of the highly symphonic pieces out there that some people complain about but rhythmic music played on few instruments has a special place too.  White Stripes did good.
B000002549|5.0|Proving that she really can pull off anything she sets her mind to, Barbra recorded this amazing collection of traditional, lieder classical music.  Streisand's instincts are seldom off, and this incredible intuition follows her into the classical realm.  Even in the context of this very difficult style of singing, Streisand's performance never seems anything less than completely natural.  In fact, Barbra's elegant rendition of Carl Orff's \\"In Trutina\\" is one of the most beautiful vocal performances I've ever heard.  Throughout the ten track album, Streisand sings in five different languages and seems completely at home in all of them.  Most amazingly, she is somehow able to meet the demands of the compositions without completely surrendering her own unique attributes.  This hybrid is at it's most spectacular on Hugo Wolf's \\"Verschwiegene Liebe\\" and George Frideric Handel's \\"Lascia ch'io pianga,\\" in which the combination composition and performer create an almost surreal beauty that echoed throughout the entire project.  Melodic and surprising, CLASSICAL BARBRA showcases yet another side to the indescribable talent known as Barbra Streisand.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Certainly not as powerful as the first four albums, I'd say Hail to the Thief one-ups Amnesiac because of the new sound found in songs like Backdrifts, Sit Down, Stand Up, and Go to Sleep.  Radiohead has always been able to shift the sound from low to high intensity in a matter of seconds and make it sound so perfect.  This whole CD if filled with those shifts.  Backdrifts is right now my favorite on the album.  Any Radiohead CD should be given 5 stars.  Buy this for sure.  And Radiohead, confirm the Salt Lake City date on the tour, please!
B00006LFGD|5.0|This compilation is actually more successful than THE ESSENTIAL BARBRA STREISAND, simply because it has a clear-cut purpose:  collect the best of the extraordinary duets that Barbra has recorded during her long career.  The tracks are not in chronological order, but that's acceptable seeing that this isn't a strict hits set.  <br />Given that Barbra can seamless blend her voice with just about anyone, it's more than a little ironic that Barbra's best duet has been with herself, on the thundering \\"One Bell Less To Answer/A House Is Not A Home\\" medley.  However, I'm not for certain that singing with your own overdubbed voice is really a duet.  Her best \\"true\\" duet is with the bluesy \\"Cryin' Time\\" with the magnificent Ray Charles, which was recorded live on a television special.  <br />The collaborations with fellow veterans Judy Garland and Frank Sintra are similarly winning, as are her smash hit duets with the more contemporary artists like Bryan Adams, Barry Gibb, Donna Summer, and, most poignantly, Neil Diamond.  Some terrific album tracks are spotlighted, like \\"Music Of The Night\\" with Michael Crawford, and the soaring \\"I Have A Love/One Hand One Heart\\" medley with Johnny Mathis.  <br />There are also some underrated singles releases that finally get a chance to shine.  Barbra's most criticized duet is unarguably the Top 40 hit \\"Till I Loved You\\" with ex-flame Don Johnson, but the track is actually much better than it's reputation.  The duets with Vince Gill and Kim Carnes (\\"If You Ever Leave Me\\" and \\"Make No Mistake, He's Mine,\\" respectively) both failed to reach the Top 40 on the Hot 100, but they're both as good as adult contemporary ballads get.  In fact, besides the classic pairing with Garland, the Carnes duet is possibly Barbra's best vocal collaboration with another woman.  <br />There are also two newly recorded duets.  The first, the restrained \\"I Won't Be The One To Let Go\\" with Barry Manilow, is very good, but the closing \\"All I Know Of Love,\\" with Josh Gorban, is the real keeper.  The song may be melodramatic and slightly generic, but Streisand and Gorban surprisingly set off vocal fireworks!  This album isn't essential to all Streisand fans, but it is a top-notch collection, with expertly packaged and remastered.  If nothing else, DUETS is a compilation that finally delivers what it's title promises.
B00005JLEU|4.0|Ok, this is a review from an animation lover. This is the first Miyazaki film I've seen, so I'm not going to compare it to his other films or even to other animated films. I bought this DVD becuase of the hype Spirited Away generated, and out of plain curiosity.<br />I love Disney, and animation in general. Though 99% of the reviews I read about Spirited Away gave it 5 stars, to me the movie is 3.5 stars. Why? well becuase basically it didn't make me feel anything. there are funny parts, there are scary parts, but the whole thing leaves you wanting more just becuase it delivered so little. Many charecters come and go, without purpose, leaving you wondering why are they here? how did they end up in this place? what is their story? and that is true, as the movie ended, I discovered that we should only care about Chihiro and not the rest of the charecters, which I find wrong and almost instantly kills the supporting cast. I now know the ending, and knowing that there's isn't anything else this movie can give me, I doubt I'll want to watch it again.<br />As for the DVD, well major disappointment. I'm sure that the contents could've been easily squeezed into one DVD. Even the Treasure Planet ONE DISK DVD has more extras. And though the claim here is that &quot;quality is more important than quantity&quot;, I disagree. The Making Of documentary (which is made by a Japanese TV station, and is in Japanese with English subtitles) is very nice, and very pleasing to see such a fresh documentary; it's structure, commentary and everything else is entierly new and very pleasing. The sad part is that many animation/movie related subjects weren't mentoined. Computer animation, abandoned sequences, history of charecters or anything to take us deeper into the myth and wonder of &quot;Spirited Away&quot;, is nowhere to be found. Only 4 features in a whole DVD is really very little. One of them is a Storyboard To Scene Comparison featurette, and another is a series of Japanese trailers(both add up to around 10 minutes) and the &quot;making of&quot; runs at 40+ minutes.<br />I still like the movie, but I don't love it, and actually doubt It'll make my top 30 best animated movies list, still the animation is superb, the dubbing is perfect, and as a whole it really takes you to another world. Sadly it leaves a lot to desire, and I believe it only scratches the surface of what could've been the best movie ever (animated or any other kind)<br />This is my personal point of view, and I'm sure many will disagree, but I tried to be as objective as I could. Thanks.
B0000025HG|4.0|The third and last album with producer Garry Klein is intended to be a concept album built around a water theme.  The album was yet another Top Ten, Platinum seller for Streisand, and it follows the same formula as the previous two Klein-produced outings.  The song selection is stronger than that of SONGBIRD, although \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\" is a forgettable dance track.  Contrary to popular opinion, I actually love the campy disco-rock cover of \\"Splish Splash,\\" which is pure fun and allows Streisand to really loosen up.       The big showpiece is the smash Donna Summer duet \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\" (#1 Pop, #7 Adult Contemporary, #20 R&B), however even this track is upstaged by the disc's six ballads.  From the opening sonnet-like title track and  the simmering cover of \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\" to the majestic \\"Niagara\\" and the closing splendor of gorgeous hit \\"Kiss Me In The Rain\\" (#37 Pop, #9 Adult Contemporary), Streisand shows us once again why she is the finest vocalist on earth
B000089RVX|5.0|Well I dont care what the other people say. It doesnt sound anything like linkin park cause I hate linkin Park. If it was to sound even remotely near LP I wouldnt have bothered getting the CD after a friend of mine had me listen to it.<br />Like I said in title.. I LOVE IT! Go out and buy it. Tis a great CD to add to collection
B000002AEN|5.0|MJH was a pre-blues songster of the highest order. His fingerstyle guitar playing is sweet, his singing is rich, and his songs are classics. This disk and his 3-CD Complete Studio Recordings (Vanguard) are the pinnacles of country blues guitar.
B00000IO4J|5.0|I was really surprised by this movie.  I was expecting your typical teen slash flick, but was treated to a humorous, nerve wracking mystery that was similar to the old monster movies of the 50's.  The cast was stellar, the dialogue crisp and on target and had a decent stoy line.  This is one movie I can watch over and over again and not get bored.
B000084T18|5.0|For all that hate on this man must like girly music that you can dance too. You can't see this man is about getting maney.  He raps about the street everyday life that half of you would never see.  So until you live it don't judge it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After &quot;Amnesiac&quot; I had wondered if we were seeing the beginning of the end for Radiohead. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; had many admirable moments artistically, but I had the feeling the band forgot that music should be enjoyed not just admired. But with &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; Radiohead has produced a masterpiece that is both mesmerizing and awe invoking. I'll leave the detailed, song-by-song reviews to others. But I will say that each song is a gem, the production and sound quality is gorgeous and the cumulative impact is magnificiently addictive. Radiohead is back.... is there a better band out there today?
B000005843|1.0|This is not a terrible release but its not that great either. Their are some decent riffs and Andy is on drums which rules but this release falls short compared to other bands . There just nothing new to offer on this release like there was with other Death Metal CD's at the time.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Always is a smart movie, with great lines all the way through. John Goodman shines in his role as Pete's best friend. Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss make a great pair - the dance scene is a classic, with Holly in that great white dress, the song Pete requests from the band, and the dirty firefighters wanting to dance with &quot;the dress.&quot; The only problem I have with the movie is the last sequence, when Dorinda is flying and loses oil pressure, then crashes into the water. The whole thing is too surreal to reconcile with reality. The movie as a whole, however, is among my favorites of all time.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is a great album which continues the tradition of Kid A and Amnesiac in that it is a good mix of progressive rock and experimental electronica. Most notably, the latter part of &quot;Sit down. Stand up.&quot; is reminicent of a composition like Aphex Twin. &quot;The Gloaming&quot; is drawn-out and compelling like &quot;Ideotique&quot;. And the last song &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot; is unlike any previous song of theirs but is an awesome finish to a wonderful cd. Altogether it is a haunting mix of melodies that further proved what an exceptionally talented and unique band Radiohead is.
B000096I9G|5.0|I've only had time to sample a little of each track on this 3-hour disc so far (what I really need is a cold, rainy, dreary night to really immerse myself in this DVD - oh, wait...I live in Vermont! That should be this weekend!!) What I've heard so far is stunning, not only in sound but in picture as well (and thankfully, the film is in 1:85 widescreen!) What I think I like most, though, is finally hearing &quot;Pornography&quot; with the lush, full-band sound it deserves - no drum machines or tinny production - putting it on a level with any of the band's later material. Of course, every bit of &quot;Disintegration&quot; is simply majestic - I didn't know whether I felt like crying or taking a shit, it moved me so much! &quot;Bloodflowers&quot; - well, what can I say?? If you're a &quot;true&quot; Cure fan (i.e., one who knows that these are their three best albums - well, ok, I gotta say I love &quot;Wish&quot; as much as these three), then you've gotta have this. One of the best concert DVD's I've seen yet, easily on a par with U2's &quot;Elevation Tour&quot; disc.
0316921173|5.0|This book is so incredible that it is impossible to do it justice simply by reviewing it. you just have to read it for yourself to see what a genius Wallace really is.
B000002C1V|2.0|The last &quot;real&quot; pink floyd album, but i think that you get very tired if you want repeated listening.
B000067CPX|5.0|This CD was just about perfect. Most of the songs are very good especially &quot;Dosed&quot; and &quot;By The Way.&quot; A few of the songs could use a little work on the lyrics, but everything else is perfect. I haven't heard any of the other Chilli Peppers CDs, but I think they did a really good job with this one CD. Four of the songs in this CD have been played on the radio, and one song was number 5 on Kroq's 106.7 songs of the year countdown.
6305718954|1.0|Having done some researched on the stigmata phenomena in the past, I was ecited to hear a movie of it was being made. The previews made it seem like an interesting movie.. Then I saw it.  Ok, 1st of all... Dumb script. The movie went on and on as if tryin to obviously explain everything to a 6 yr old. The cardinal sends the priest to explore these cases...yet is appalled when he tries to look deeper into them.. Stupid. They explain to the priest who wrote the Gospels (guess he was absent during that part of class)..In this day and age do many poeple still not know what a rosary is? <BR>Overall..very disappointing movie... Not deep. Not thought-provocking. Just a cheesy written film, badly acted,..with a wannbe controversial message stamped to the end... yawn.  NEXT.
B00005JKPF|5.0|I thought this movie was unbeleivable. I really thought they did a great job on the new effects, and I love the whole story to this film better than the first. I would definitely reccomend this film to anyone who shows any interest in comics or even those curious about the Xmen. I do also reccommend seing the first one, only so that you will understand some of the scenes with Jean, Wolverine, and Mystique.
0393057658|5.0|As an advid Oakland A's fan I couldn't wait to read this book. The last few years since Billy Beane became General Manager of the A's, I've been wondering how or why he made some of the trades/moves that he did? <BR> This book explains exactly what I and many A's fans have been wondering about the trades and moves Billy has made over the last few seasons. <BR> Michael Lewis explains what makes Billy Beane tick and sometimes explode! He gives us a behind the scenes look at Billy and his low budget A's! Michael Lewis also shows us why baseball is like no other sport where stats are more important in judging players, and how Billy Beane and Paul Depodesta(A's assistant G.M.) use on base percentage stats and other stats to make trades and draft baseball prospects! Michael also gives us a brief background on Bill James and Voros McCracken and their theories. <BR> After reading this book you come to wonder why teams would pay so much money for players that don't produce like the Low budget A's, Now I can't wait to see what Billy's Next move(s) will be!
0679882820|5.0|We introduced our nine-month-old son to Dr. Seuss with this book. He's a year old now and is still loving it -- this is one of the few books that will hold his attention from the first page to the last. He loves hearing all of the sound words (we're still trying to get him to say \\"onomatopoeia\\"!) and laughs like crazy when \\"Mr. Brown can BUZZ!\\" I'd recommend this book to anyone!
B00005JLWN|4.0|I didn't expect much when I rented this DVD.  I had never heard anything about Equilibrium when it came out in theaters last December and I'm sure I wasn't the only one.   The film bombed as could be expected since not many were even aware of its existence.  And then, the marketing team tried to connect it with the Matrix phenomenon to get their products known, even putting references to it on the back cover of the DVD.  I agree with some reviews that the implied connection does somewhat of a disservice to the movie.  This is no Matrix as it shouldn't be, even though a few minor elements might be seen by some as \\"Matrix-influenced\\".<br />After a third world war, a new regime has decreed that feelings are dangerous and the cause of every human being's self-destructive behavior.  Therefore, they decided to suppress emotions in the population by using regular doses of a drug which will inhibit their capacity to feel.  \\"Clericals\\" are highly trained officiers hunting down and executing \\"sense offenders\\", who are people that stopped using the drug.  This premise is actually interesting even though not necessarily new, with obvious references to \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and \\"1984\\" among others. <br />Shot on a very low budget especially for a sci-fi flick, some of the special effects are definitely on the cheap side but surprisingly, the whole look of the movie is quite stunning.  Dark and greyish tones are utilized in different sets to evoke a sense of rigidity and coldness which fits well with the storyline.  The plot is fairly simple but engaging, even though many aspects of it border on the cliche and seem convoluted at times.  Despite its flaws, I found myself quite engrossed in the story even though it still felt a bit like a ripoff from so many other sci-fi movies I had seen.<br />One thing that really irritated me about this though, as some reviewers have pointed out, is the fact that all the actors who were supposed to play characters unable to feel would emote all overthe place.  In the short documentary about the making of the movie, the director explains that he made the conscious decision to have the actors avoid playing their characters as \\"zombies\\" because he felt like it would have been much less interesting for the audience.  Excuse me?  Personally, seeing all those actors show every emotion in the book made the whole purpose of the story seem ridiculous and pointless.<br />Christian Bale as the lead probably gives the best performance, even if he has some trouble making the switch from cold to emotional seem fluid.  Then again, how is the audience supposed to see the difference between a character who is still under the influence of the drug and one who isn't when everybody acts the same way?  I must admit this really bothered me because I feel like the movie could have been even better if the acting was more in accordance with the story.<br />     This said, I still enjoyed Equilibrium quite a lot as I was able to suspend disbelief long enough to not let this big flaw ruin my appreciation of the film.  I won't pretend this is a masterpiece but rather, a good \\"little\\" movie who deserves to be seen and appreciated.  Four stars seemed appropriate here as I felt like, although not the best sci-fi I've ever seen, it is far from being the worst either.  It has a coolness and sophistication which redeems its flaws and I truly feel like the movie deserves an audience.  Give it a try if you are a sci-fi fan.
0688163173|2.0|It's hard to figure out why Lehane has strayed from his Kenzie-Gennaro series -- some really fine reads there and engaging characters. Mystic River was a departure and much more of a main stream kind of novel with a lot of depth of character.  Shutter Island just does not engage.  I didn't care about Teddy Daniels, the main character, enough to care what happened to him. The novel has so many twists and turns, there's no focus. By the time I got to the end, it was more a relief than a surprise.

B00005JLWN|5.0|For action sake why this movie was so poorly received by critics?  Ok, I'm a huge action fan.  I love watching a movie with well-developed characters, great plot, interesting conversations but when I rent something in the action category I am expecting to see a film where the main character kicks some serious butt.  Equilibrium was great!  It not only satisfied my hunger to see beautifully choreographed gun battles but it also delivered likable characters and an intense plot.  Christian Bale shines in his role as the cleric John Peterson.  His expression is so cold, his stance with a gun in each hand exudes extreme power and fearlessness.  In fact, he doesn't feel fear because he has to take Prozium, a drug that eliminates emotion.  Accidentally, however, one day John misses the dose of his drug and starts feeling the world around himself like a true human.  This is where the trouble starts and cool fight scenes begin.<br />If you are an action fan, you will love the fights in Equlibrium.  I'm also a big Matrix fan and after watching Equlibrium I have to say the gun battle scenes of this movie can almost put Matrix to shame.  For the love of action, do not miss this film!  This film does indeed shows us something new.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Each successive release plays to me like a piece of one giant perfect recording.<br />Mind blowing.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Simply put this was Arnold's best action flick ever.  The story, acting, special effects are all superb for a movie that was released in 1984.  Terminator 2 was also a great movie, but moreso for the incredible (at least for 1991) special effects, and not as much for the story.  Basically Terminator and T2 are both AWESOME movies, but T1 was better, even if the special effects look dated nearly 20 years later.<br />Buy this DVD, and T2. You won't be dissapointed.
B000092ZYX|5.0|There are no words to describe how amazing this album really is. Call me weird, but this cd is hard to listen to from song 1 to song 14 because each song puts you in a mood to listen to other tracks on the album.  For example, as soon as you pop in your copy of \\"Hail to the Thief\\" and hear the killer jam of \\"2+2=5\\", it makes me want to skip to other cool, rockin' jams on the album like \\"Where I end and you begin\\", and \\"A Drunken Punch-up At A Wedding\\", which in my mind is the best track on the album.<BR>However, if i hear the haunting tune of \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\", I will automatically skip to \\"We Suck Young Blood\\", both songs which are good to hear when you feel moody or just feel like hearing something spooky.  Then you get to songs that are uplifting that can possibly make people cry b/c they are so beautiful, songs such as \\"Sail to the Moon\\", which plays big brother to \\"Pyramid Song\\", and \\"Scatterbrain\\", a song that becomes addicting to you.<br />The point I am trying to make is that this cd will make you feel a number of emotions, which is probably due to the different moods that this album is based on.  Unlike their previous cd's, Hail to the Thief is an album that is difficult to pop in without knowing which songs you want to hear.  But it works for me because I'm tired of putting in \\"Street Spirit\\" and \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" everytime i feel depressed.  There are new jams to hear, which probably make up the best offering from these 5 lads from Oxford.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief is Radhiohead's best album yet combining the best qualities of The Bends, OK Computer, and Kid A. This is progressive Rock at its most compelling. <br />Although the message of Hail to the Thief can be interpreted in many ways, it is clear that Thom Yorke is expressing his utter disgust with the Bush Administration, the War on Terrorism, the enroachment of government upon freedom and civil liberties. But, unlike RAGE, Radiohead is much more subtle and alleghorical with its political and social commentary. <br />Radiohead should be commended for speaking out against the current state of affairs and taking a stand against the excesses of George Bush and Tony Blair's governments. <br />Anger, frustration, sadness, and torment color most of the songs of the album. And this raw emotion makes the music all the more beautiful. To name only one example, Sail to the Moon is one of the most fearlessly evocative songs I have heard in years. <br />Kudos to Radiohead for making the most relevant and important album in recent memory.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This movie is insane...it's a trip in itself. Jake Gyllenhaal, one of the most talented young actors out there, totally outdoes himself in Donnie Darko. out of all the movies i've seen, this one is second only to The Godfather in my mind. if you like darker movies that make you think a little bit, you'll love this one. the first time i rented Donnie Darko, i watched it 3 times in a weekend and i was still floored by the story.  it's a creepy ride, but when it's over you'll be begging for more...
B000059T00|5.0|Why didn't Blind Faith last longer? They had such a classic debut, and they could've made some terrific songs judging from what's on here. Every song is a killer. Had To Cry Today has a amazing riff from Steve Winwood (he wrote the song), and some dual guitar soloing from God, Eric Clapton. This was when Clapton was cool, and not a adult contempary star. Can't Find My Way Home is a terrific ballad. Steve Winwood really shines with his vocals here. Well All Right sounds nothing like the Buddy Holly original it was. There's some good jamming at the end. Presence Of The Lord is what you would call the single of the album, written by Clapton. Clapton's great wah wah riff is in this song. A God moment. Sea Of Joy is the epic of the album, with gentle acoustic guitar and soft violin in the middle. Do What You Like is Coltrane in rock. Everyone gets a chance to solo on this song, and they all do it well. Ginger Baker's drum solo is memorable, which is rare in drum solos. I actually wish it was a few minutes longer, or at least have a long intro. But this is a great album from a short-lived supergroup. Very good.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I've seen a lot of mixed reviews for Hail to the Thief, but I don't agree with any of the negative stuff as I haven't been able to listen to anything else since I got it. It definitely seems to be a 50/50 mix of OK Computer and Kid A/Amnesiac stuff and is all the better for it. I guess it helps if you like Aphex Twin as much as you like Radiohead, and seeing as I do it's all thumbs up here. It does take a couple of listens for it to hit home, but it's worth the time, and the opening and closing tracks are explosive tunes. Love the special edition roadmap packaging too.
B000002OZY|4.0|I think this is a very good album, but not as good as Who's Next, Quadrophenia, and the last few albums. The songs are great, there's good playing, but it has horrid production and it's sounds soft. Live, they were on a whole different level. I'd prefer Live At Leeds Deluxe Edition and Isle of Wight 1970 over this. But the original isn't completely bad. Acid Queen is my personal favorite, and there's Cousin Kevin, an underrated gem. Welcome, Sensation, and 1921 are amazing songs. However, there's some bad filler in here like There's a Doctor, Underture (a complete rehash of Sparks), and Miracle Cure. However, Sally Simpson has some great production and sounds like Who's Next. The Who has had better albums, though, but this is a step in the right direction.
B000092ZYY|5.0|If you are looking for a break from listening to the caucophony of music of today, (the rock music that is forced into your ears by record execs and whoever else makes it so you have to listen to nothing but bad music) which happens to all sound basically the same, then look no further.  Unlike Radiohead's previous 2 albums, Kid A and Amnesiac, Hail to the Thief retains all of the best parts of their &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;The Bends&quot; and manages to keep all of their music within the same genre.  With a more &quot;rockish&quot; sound, the band makes love to your ears with songs like &quot;2+2=5&quot;, a build-up rocker that will leave you with a sense of &quot;Why does it have to end?&quot;, &quot;Backdrifts&quot; a techno-rock smash remanescent of their song &quot;Idioteque&quot; from their album Kid A (2000). 5 Stars.  The songs couldn't be more well assembled and enthralling.  Thom Yorke's voice once again doesn't fail to impress.  Johnny Greenwood's guitar riffs and amazing work on his Ondes Martenot and Analogue Synth are excellent.  Phil Selway's drums are almost all entirely unique in every song.  Ed O'Brian's effects are &quot;WOW&quot;.  Colin Greenwood's bass in this album soars and has left a very lasting impression enough to help make this a unique album.  Definately my new favorite album of all time.  A MUST HAVE for any musician wanting to listen to music that could give some positive inspiration.
B000092ZYX|5.0|After Amnesiac and Kid A that brought both mixed feelings from older fans, yet at the same time bringing in some new listeners, Radiohead hits it on this one.  The album is just raw enough to dodge endless radio play and just gorgeous enough to keep you listening to it on repeat over and over...and over.  The themes in this one, go beyond alienation in OK Computer, and frustration with the way of the world in Kid A, into a profound fear of where we are in life and where we are going.  A fear that we should all share in one aspect or another.  They music is nothing less than beautiful, ranging from electronic beats to mellow guitar peaces all intertwined with Yorke's emotional angst and beautiful arias.  As always, Yorke's lyrics are both to the point and shrouded behind metaphors, that make what he is saying all the more powerful.  This is one of those fufilling albums that grows on you the more you listen to it, signalling a Radiohead classic once again.  Not only is this possibly the best Radiohead album yet, but possibly one of the best progressive rock albums of the year so far.
B0000024JA|4.0|This album was released in 1994 on the Def Jam label and was the first official solo Wu-Tang Clan release. Method Man was always one of the premier members of the Wu and his first solo album really shines with originality. Johnny Blaze a.k.a Method Man wanted more time to work on the album and wasn't really satisfied with his effort even though he did a solid job on \\"Tical\\". Meth's not the greatest lyricist in the Wu or in the rap game. However, his original style,voice and flow rank among Hip-Hop's best, making him one of the most recognizable and respected MC's ever. Tical's elements are RZA's grimy, rugged beats and Meth's rhyming making this album a Wu-Tang Banger for ages. There are 13 tracks total and I can't really call any song wack but some are stronger than others. Guest appearances are made by Raekwon, RZA, Inspectah Deck, Street Thug a.k.a Street Life, Carlton Fisk and Blue Raspberry lends her vocals on \\" Release Yo' Delf\\". The highlight track on this album is track 3 \\"Bring the Pain\\". This track has crazy beats by the RZA and Mef adds the essential rhyming to classify this song as a Wu Classic. For those that don't know track 2 is called \\"Biscuits\\" referring to guns and track 9 \\"P.L.O. Style\\" meaning Palestine Liberation Organization, which is a group of Arab terrorists.(No joke). Meth's not talkin about terrorism on this track. He means his style is deadly not by guns but with rhymin and this brings terror among other MC's. In my opinion this album was ahead of its time just because of the total flow it possesses. \\"Tical\\" never gets old because Method Man's voice and rhyming style has gone virtually unchanged since 1993 and in this case since 1994. This is a must for any Wu-Tang fan or any Hip-Hop fan just because this album is so original. Not everyone will agree this album is a classic, but they must agree that this album was one of the best of 94'. PEACE....
B000092ZYX|4.0|Radiohead have shown that maybe they are headed back to their roots on Hail to the Thief.  Drums and guitars have come back replacing synths and keyboards.  Overall I think it's a fine album.  If you liked Kid A and Amnesiac then there's no doubt you will like this cd.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Considering the substanial hype, it seems too much of a Lindsey Buckingham album. I know, I know, it started out as one of his solo albums before it was a Fleetwood Mac Cd. Well, I liked Buckingham's production on Tusk, but since then, it's been a little cheezy for my tastes.  Also, there is some really excessive guitar wanking on a few tracks. Some may applaud it, or at least be surprised by it, but it sure gets old fast.<BR>Also, I thought I would be glad to hear an album without Christine McVie songs, but it  seems a little empty without her musicianship. So, go ahead and pass on this one. Instead, seek out an independent group that may still have something new to offer.
6301966562|3.0|This is one of those charming stories, where guy #1 battles with guy #2 to get the girl - except that in this case, guy #2 is a computer with a rather stubborn personality! The technology looks fairly amusing these days (who would have thought we would need such enormous, clumsy computers?), but the plot and characters are still endearing after all these years. Worth a look!
B00005MP58|5.0|Great masterpiece of the screen. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE....THOUGH I ALSO RECCOMEND THAT YOU HAVE A DICTIONARY WITH YOU AS YOU WATCH IT. THIS IS MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE MOVIE.
B00005YW4H|5.0|What rock have you been living under? This is quite simply the most tasteful thing to hit the scene that sits very easily between the jazz and country worlds and sounds quite exquisite in between. Outstanding 'mood music', great to fall asleep to, and a perfect example of an album that follows the 'KISS' principle musically. I just hope the next album lives up to this standard!<br />Get thy mouse hovering and order it now!
6305282927|5.0|Oklahoma! is well made with a very good story. The songs are added glitter to this glimmering jewel of a movie. You'll love Shirley Jones and Gordon McCrae as they portray sweet Laurey Williams and the bronc bustin' cowboy, Curly. This sweet story is full of laughs and the whole family is sure to enjoy it. <br />I rate it 6 stars!!!!!
B00000DGUG|5.0|I've enjoyed this CD very much.  The music is mostly of one tone - dark and angry - but the lyrics are thoughtful and well-articulated.  The whole disc is playable, unlike so many CDs with their clearly-delineated Radio Tracks and Filler Tracks.  Everything here is a worthwhile listen.  If you liked &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; this is a definite must-have.
B00006RU5B|5.0|No it's not exactly RATM and no it's not exactly soundgarden but it was better than i expected. The instrumentation is amazing, the band does and awesome job, you even hear their roots from rage in every song. Chris does a good job vocally. I didn't like this CD when i first got it but now it's one of my favorite ones ever.
0345448898|5.0|The His Dark Materials trilogy was my second attempt to find a series to keep me busy between Potter books (the first being Tolkein), and I have to say, it was extremely rewarding.  The comparisons to Harry Potter should stop at the fact that both series include children as main characters, fall into the Fantasy realm, and have British authors.  HDM is a darker series with a much more controversial storyline.  In the books, Lyra, a girl raised by a college of professors in an alternate-universe kind of Oxford, and Will, a boy with a haunted mother and a missing father, journey through their world and other worlds to save the world's children from one man's plan to cut them from their daemons (the outward manifestation of the soul).  To say that this is a complex story is an understatement, yet Pullman creates more than one beautiful world with grace and apparent ease.<br />The books have been released both as young-adult trade paperbacks and as mass-market paperbacks geared to attract adult science fiction/fantasy readers, and I think the latter audience is the more likely sell.  This is a fabulous series for adults and older children, particularly if they can read it together and discuss its points.
B00000258J|5.0|A great back-up band (too bad pianist Otis Spann had passed away) with James Cotton, Johnny Winter, &quot;Pinetop&quot; Perkins, Margolis, ect.  &quot;I can't be Satisfied&quot; is arguably the best song on the album, WOW what a song!  If you like the blues (you don't even have to love the blues, just like the blues) you would be missin' out if you don't even listen to this album and give it a whirl.  Live a little, it's MUDDY WATERS!  p.s. All the songs where done in just one take, put that in your pipe and smoke it.
B00009L1UP|5.0|This album will always be a classic. It is full of great musicianship and Geoff Tate is obviously one of the great rock singers of all time. However, it has never sounded this good before. The remastering gives a great deal more punch to the album and the bonus tracks are just as good as the rest of the songs on the album. I only wish that they had been put on it in the first place. The production of this album is exceptional and Chris Degarmo was really writing some amazing material at this point in the bands career. For those who are fans of Progressive Metal this is an album that is essential for your collection.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I wish I got into this band a lot sooner than I did. They are one of the few good new bands out there, along with Mooney Suzuki and The Datsuns. There is a great development in songwriting and skill, and a lot more overdubs than White Blood Cells. Gone are the 3 minute pop songs, replaced by more personal rock songs with big guitar solos. For 2 people, they know how to rock. My favorites are the single Seven Nation Army, Black Math, Ball and Biscuit, The Air Beneath My Fingers, and The Hardest Button To Button. There is not one weak song on this album. A lot of emotion and soul is found in each of the songs on here. Mostly Anger, annoyance, and confusion. I hope they do another album in this direction soon.
B000092ZYX|3.0|But nothing will top OK Computer.<br />Nothing.<br />Every band has its masterpiece.<br />That was it.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Before purchasing this DVD set, you must ask yourself this simple question:  \\"Am I a true Led Zeppelin fan or do I just like a few songs I hear on the radio?\\"<br />If you are just a casual fan who likes the cuts they hear on the radio and may own an album or two, this DVD is definitely not for you.  This DVD is for the hardest of hardcore Led Zeppelin fans.  For those of us who weren't fortunate enough to be around during Zeppelin's heyday, then this DVD is a dream come true.<br />For years I had heard all the stories about how amazing Led Zeppelin's live shows were.  Of course I've seen \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" countless times and have a few bootlegs that are just good enough to tease.  After completing just half of the first DVD, I felt that I had finally found the Zeppelin Holy Grail.  <br />The performances on this DVD don't completely live up to the hype, but they sure do come close.  While the performances themselves are amazing, it's the little things that really turned me on.  Watching how the band communicates through their improv sessions, the fact that John Bonham sung backup on Bron-Yr-Aur Stomp, seeing John Paul Jones playing the mandolin parts that I always thought were Jimmy's, and countless other little bits that make it all worth the watch.<br />I'm not going to state that all the performances are perfect, because they certainly are not.  The reason Led Zeppelin's live shows were so legendary was because of how much improvisation they emphasize in the performances.  It's extremely rare to see that in a Rock and Roll band outside of the Dead.  I believe the band maintained the ethic that sure it may not be perfect, and sometimes downright messy, but when they get into a groove, it's truly lightning in a bottle.  These improvised jams tend to be something that only musicians with jazz or blues backgrounds tend to understand.  That's exactly why Led Zeppelin was in a class all their own.<br />I personally tend to disagree with those that make Led Zeppelin out to be the fathers of heavy metal. True, they were a major influence then and now, but it's got too much of a base in blues and jazz to be compared to Metal.  I think we're better off leaving that title to the likes of Black Sabbath.  After seeing and hearing some of the material on this DVD it just re-emphasized this thought.  The concert at Royal Albert Hall is just one blues jam after another with hints of their songs thrown in to give it a sense of cohesion.  <br />For all of those musicians out there who idolized Jimmy Page as I did, you will not be disappointed in the slightest.  To see how he communicates with the rest of the band as he goes through his wild improvisations is simply amazing.  While it is true that Jimmy tends to be a very sloppy guitarist, it doesn't change the fact that when he's on, he's REALLY on.  To me the term \\"sloppy\\" is kind of silly.  No he's not precise like your Joe Satriani's or Eddie Van Halen's, he is however extremely musical.  To be as improvisation oriented as he is takes a lot of talent, knowledge, and well...balls.  Something that many of today's guitarists simply don't have.<br />While I love going to rock concerts to listen to my favorite bands, I always feel a bit ripped off because what is being performed is almost identical to what you were just listening to on the radio coming to the show.  This can never be said about Led Zeppelin's live performances.  Every night is its own experience.<br /> That is captured, for the most part, throughout this DVD.  As I have repeatedly stated, these performances are more jams than just song after song.  If you watch this DVD over and over again, sure you will find tons of musical mistakes.  However, if you take it for what it is, a single moment in time, then you can't deny its power.  Led Zeppelin was one of the gutsiest, energetic, and awe inspiring live bands in the history of music.  <br />If you are a musician and don't find this to be a major educational and emotional experience, then in my humble opinion, it's time to re-evaluate what music is to you.  To me music was always a way to convey an emotional state through your performance.  If you limit yourself to a pre-existing structure, then you've just taken away the essence of what the music was meant to be.  <br />Essence.  That is what this DVD is.  The essence of the music, culture, and time that was all Led Zeppelin's.
B00000637V|4.0|When \\"Berlin\\" was first released I HAD TO HAVE IT ... prior to \\"Berlin\\" my collection of Lou Reed was simply a couple of Velvet Underground LPs in import editions ... they weren't released locally in Sydney ... his eponymous solo album \\"Lou Reed\\" and of course \\"Transformer\\".  Then came \\"Berlin\\" ... and it blew me away ... and I played it and played it and played it ... and still do only now on CD.  It's a bleak and wonderful album.  Sparse production, minimal arrangements over lush orchestration and above all Lou Reed's completely dispassionate voice relating the decay, breakdown and aftermath of a relationship ... His?  Someone else's?  Who knows ... listen to the little kid's voice in \\"The Kids\\" yelling over and over \\"Mummy ... Mummy\\" and by the time \\"Sad Song\\" unravels it's wings like a butterfly emerging from the catharsis of the cocoon of songs preceding it you know you've just listened to a piece of modern literature and not a pop album.  \\"Limp Dick\\"?  Well, I recall at the time of \\"Berlin\\"'s release one of the many negative reviews I read, and there were quite a few, referred to the album in quite disparaging terms and noted Bob Ezrin's \\"limp dick\\" production; a phrase I've remembered and used many times since to describe critic's reviews.  I'm glad time, and the many reviews of listeners here on Amazon who love music and care about it, have vindicated Lou's vision.  Not that I imagine he'd care.  I think Lou Reed knows who he is and his faith in his own work and its validity is just as strong today as it was then ...
B0000028RR|4.0|1. If you want to hear to good &quot;music&quot;- plz look elsewhere...<BR>2. If you are a fan of metal- do the same- this ting is NOT metal.<BR>3. If you are a fan of rap- you can safely bypass it- it has one or two similarities, but it's NOT Rap.<BR>Tom Morello (the group guitar boy) sounds like he is a robot with a malfunctioning Jimmy Page chip planted to his brain. About 50% of the times it malfunctions, but the other half of times it creates TERRIFIC riffs of the highest caliber.<BR>The bass player and the drum boy are really good musicians- although hardly something more than that.<BR>There is also the agitator named Zack de la Rocha, which is supposed to sing... well, he doesn't sing, but did Johhny &quot;Rotten&quot; Lydon sing?<BR>Personally i cansider the next two albums pretty indifferent, but on this debut, the magical chemistry of the Morello/La Rotta chemical equation cretes wht is the most important rock album of the nineties. In fact, it is because of albums like that I consider that rock'n'roll is not dead.<BR>In short, if you have to get ONE album of the 1990+ rock releases, get this one- you cannot go wrong.<BR>Surely enough, this is NOT good music... Rock'n'Roll never was &quot;good music&quot;. But I don't think this is a factor when we talk about rock'n'roll. What counts there is the style and the feeling, and regarding that this album is simply GORGEOUS.<BR>Just four stars, instead of five, because no rock album after John Cale's Sabotage (1980) or Clash's Sandinista deserves the five stars, really. Oh, and pull this f*%cking bullet of your head, please- it might help.
B00005JKZV|3.0|Look, the movie's great, but remember what happened last<BR>year with LotR: FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING!

B000092ZYX|3.0|here's my deal:  i WAS a huge radiohead fan.  then Kid A came out.  i hated and still hate Kid A.  <br />i dont know where the band that made OK Computer and the Bends went when they made Kid A but this seems to be right on with the rest of the reviews as having more similarity with OK Computer.  this is a good CD so far.  I've listened to it twice.  it's kind of depressing.  try not to take any sleeping pills while listening to it.   <br />overall, i like it.  if you loved OK Computer like I do (i consider it one of the best rock albums of all time) you MAY like this cd.  will you love it though?  i doubt it.
B00005JLR2|3.0|It's always a gamble when you adapt a timeless classic like Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island.\\"  It's even especially dicey when you take the story out of its original setting and time. In this case, Walt Disney studios try to give the old swashbuckler a futuristic sci-fi spin in TREASURE PLANET, a film that partially succeeds in that task.  Set in a future time on a far off planet, the familiar story of heroic cabin-boy Jim Hawkins and the charming pirate Long John Silver is given the space ace treatment.  Instead of the one legged pirate we know, Long John is now a cyborg.  The Squire and Doctor characters who lead the treasure expedition are combined into one eccentric type (David Hyde-Pierce), while the ship's captain is a no nonsense feline voiced by Emma Thompson.   Finally, the castaway Ben Gunn is reimagined as a run-at-the mouth robot (Martin Short), who has lost his memory chip.  The animation is stunning and many of these characterizations work for the most part.  The one exception is the cyborg Silver.  Played with an Irish brogue and charm, I found it hard to really see this character as being totally capable of evil, as is his counterpart in the original book. Indeed, it's hard to take this softie seriously at times.  Part of the attraction of the Long John Silver creation is that he is a balance of good and evil.  He becomes a character we like, even as we loath his deeds.  <BR>Other than that, this film is suprisingly faithful to the book in the basic plot, and it deserved better than what the critics gave the film when it was first released.  Overall, this is a version that I would recommend, despite the fact that there are better adaptations and better portrayals of Long John Silver elsewhere.
B000092ZYX|5.0|The album is very strong. Radiohead become melodic again. The abstract electronica is of course embedded through the album but is not the dominant element like in their past 2 albums.<br />Strangely enough this is not an album that you must listen to it a 100 times before it clicks. It comes strong right from the start. It has the very familiar melancholy of OK Computer and in some instances I can recognize chunks of musical ideas from OK Computer resurfacing, with a new spin, reworked and matured.<br />Something that was a pleasant surprise is the bass guitar and the low frequency sound in general.Very strong, stands out in the front, in particular in &quot;Where I end and you begin&quot; which will surely become a classic.<br />This is a great piece of work that will satisfy all the hardcore fans. We were expecting that at some point Radiohead will return from the complete abstract song writing and sound which is usually characterized by lack of emotion to the warmer sounds of guitars and some piano and straight cut percussion. <BR>Well, they have come back. They have kept the best elements from their journey and put it in great use, fusing it with their signature songwriting.<br />I recommend this work to everyone. It is a fantastic and long awaited album.
B000092ZYX|2.0|A disappointment. The best song is easily &quot;There there&quot;, while the rest is mostly uninspired, meandering filler. Supposedly a mesh of their more recent experimental style and their original guitar rock flavors, the album can't hold a candle to any of &quot;Kid A&quot;, &quot;Amnesiac&quot;, or &quot;The Bends&quot;. Radiohead was once one of the best bands in the world. What went wrong? Boring.
067144901X|5.0|My daughter absolutely adores this book.  At 18 months she actually reads the book back to me! She points to each page and makes the animal sound, until she gets to the pigs where she just says...\\"no no\\" since she knows the pigs should say oink!  I actually enjoy reading this book myself!
0066214122|4.0|This book is an excelent novel. Michael Crichton out does himself. Writing one of the best books i've read to date. This book is about nanotechnology and how it can destroy us and how we have to be careful with science and nature. Its a good novel, but some parts can be difficult to understand. Great book, I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Lots of fun to watch and the quality is superb.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Like all masterpieces, Radiohead's \\"Hail to the Thief\\" takes a few extra listens. Nearly two months ago, I found the MP3s to \\"Hail to the Thief\\" somewhere online and burned myself a copy. I bought the special edition CD today and am even more impressed. The work that went into the music from April to June paid off; the remixing made each song that much better. Although I cannot compare this record to \\"OK Computer\\" (as \\"OK Computer\\" is my favorite record of all time), it does hold water--a lot of it. \\"Kid A\\" was a departure and a new beginning. \\"Amnesiac,\\" in my opinion should have been released with \\"Kid A\\" as a double LP. It was their weakest album since \\"Pablo Honey\\" and could hardly stand alone. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" fills the gap that the differences between \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\" exposed so harshly. It is both rock and art, simple and involved. There is trance, electronica, blues, and even some Bob Dylanesque moments. It is diverse and cohesive at the same time, a feat many try to accomplsh and many fail to succeed. <br />The underlying reason why \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is better than \\"Amnesiac\\" is because it doesn't get boring halfway through. All of the songs, save \\"We Suck Young Blood,\\" are very good songs are are placed very strategically throughout the record. The opposite occurred with \\"Amnesiac.\\" \\"Pyramid Song,\\" \\"Knives out,\\" \\"Amnesiac/Morning Bell,\\" and \\"Life in a glass house\\" were amazing songs, but the rest of the album was plagued with filler and nonsense. IE: \\"Hunting Bears,\\" \\"Pulk/pull revolving doors,\\" and \\"Like spinning plates.\\" I would say that if you utterly enjoyed \\"OK Computer\\" and welcomed \\"Kid A,\\" \\"Hail to the Thief\\" will be something worthwile. If you liked neither, then the album may be a bit challenging. One last note: \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is difficult at first, but like other masterpieces such as My Bloody Valentine's self-titled album, Sigur Ros' trio of albums, and, dare I say, Blur's \\"Think Tank,\\" it will shine brightly and eternally.
0385504209|5.0|This was a fabulous, fast-paced, intriguing read.  The plot was as intricate as a maze and highly entertaining.  It was particularly fascinating to learn so much about the sacred Feminine throughout history.  I seldom read a book that teaches me something I never knew before..particularly in Math of all things.  I'm very happy to learn that Mr. Brown is working on a sequel.  I highly recommend this book if you're looking for an exciting, unputdownable read.  You won't be disappointed.
B00005R2M3|5.0|Shakira is simply a great singer with her lovely voice, juicy n danceable pop - My fav 'Laundry Service', an album one can't resist to Listen again n again - Wherever, Whenever! Yeah, this one's a cool track that makes you put on the dancing shoes and swing the pop beat. Objection is a flawless Tango Delight with the Latin flavor and beautiful composition n lyrics. Underneath your clothes is a soft ballad brewing up emotions. Te Dejo Madrid is a Spanish number very melodious and lively number. Ready for the Times is a pep dance number. Suerte, the spanish version of Whenever, wherever is good listening. Shakira reminds of sparkling stars, shining moon and dancing on the floor swaying with joy - My choice, that's Shakira, cool Tangoing!!!
0465011020|5.0|Other reviewers have already noted the importance of this book in documenting the pervasive pattern and Kafkaesque quality of human rights violations in North Korea, so I shall concentrate instead on what other help this book offers for penetrating the veil of secrecy in which P'yongyang wraps itself.<br />In the past decade or so, there has been an explosion of Western interest in North Korea that has contributed substantially to a better understanding of P'yongyang's policy priorities and problems. Of particular note in this regard are two publications: \\"North Korea: Through the Looking Glass,\\" an elegant and balanced study published by the Brookings Institute, and \\"Kim Il-song's North Korea,\\" which presents the meticulously- detailed research undertaken by Helen Louise Hunter while she was still with the CIA. Both of these publications benefitted  from the exploitation of defector information, but their homogenized findings still lack a sense of ground truth, and it is in this regards that Kang Chol-hwan's account of his life in North Korea is so valuable apart from its obvious importance on the human rights front.<br />\\"Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" provides a considerable body of anecdotal information that documents several trends which, North Korean government pronouncements make clear, are of increasing concern to the central government.  These trends are rising hooliganism, especially on the part of youth gangs; rampant corruption and bribery in nearly all sectors of society; and a surprising underground use of currency (not always North Korean) in an economy that has traditionally been described as non-monetarized. Neither collectively nor individually are these trends underwriting an organized opposition, but they have substantially eroded both government control of the citizenry and public faith in the regime's relevancy and attractiveness.  Also answered by \\"Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" are such questions as what happens to the goods and cash that the Japanese sendto relatives in  North Korea; how North Koreans manage escapes to China; and how the lives of the privileged few differ from those of the multitudes.  \\"Aquariums\\" is especially well-paired with Hunter's book, which defines the vocabulary of everyday life in North Korea.
B000068VHP|3.0|Well...I have to agree completely with the previous reviewer; with so many pre-1990's artists re-releasing albums originally recorded in analog (ie. Pet Shop Boys, Tears for Fears, Cocteau Twins), and doing it well (digital sound quality, expanded liner notes, extra tracks &amp; remixes), The Cranberries unfortunately rank at the bottom of the &quot;must-have remasters&quot; list.  Shame, because &quot;EEIDISWCW?&quot;, and &quot;No Need to Argue&quot; are two of the most important albums of that decade, but with no noticable improvement in sound quality, the purist's sole reason for purchasing these revamped versions has been removed.  The new packaging and two or three extra tracks on each release are a nice bonus, but do not warrant purchasing all of these albums again, if you already own them (and everyone certainly should). In short, buy &quot;Everyone Else...?&quot; only if you do not have it, as it IS one of the most important records of the 1990's, but if improved sound quality is what you are looking for, steer clear of these releases.  Five stars for album, one star for &quot;remaster&quot;
B00008K7AN|5.0|i had some thoughts about seeing this when it came out in theaters, but i didnt. so i decided to rent it- I enjoyed it a lot.

That girl who played Jessica is really really hot(hence the title, lol)- whats her name, Rachel McAdams? anyone know where I can find a site with pics/bio/etc? if so email me(click on my name)<br />see this movie, its a little girly but its funny
B000092ZYY|5.0|If you feel that the culmination of the ousnd of radio head was ok computer, or if you like the new direction post ok computer, have no fear, this album is going to work for you either way.  It is such a complment to the band's ability, and thoughtfullness of their artistic vision, not to just produce another hit filled album but to say soemthing with meaning.
0393057658|5.0|Reading through this book, one gets the impression that arcane baseball stats that most major league GM's don't care about but should, coupled with the sly and shrewd businessman that Billy Beane appears to be has been a winning combination for the Oakland A's. A team that virtually everyone counted out after the 2001 season came back to win over and over in 2002. Although I'm not an Oakland A's fan, I found myself grinning at the moves that Beane makes again and again to not only keep his team winning, but spend as little as possible in the process. Lose your three best players? No problem. Just reload with cheaper replacements. Lose more players after the season? No problem..cheaper replacements are on the way. The A's and other small market teams like the Twins who also are winning poke a huge hole in Bud Selig's contention that these \\"small market teams\\" should have been contracted just a year or two ago.<br />Another thing I noticed about this book is how Beane dispenses with the conventional wisdom of running a baseball team in favor of his own method. So far it obviously has worked, and worked well. And yet only two other major league teams as of the book's publishing have embraced this method. The other teams seem insistent on running a team as inefficiently as possible. All the better for Beane to continue to work his magic.<br />Numerous folk have commented in reviews of this book that it will be harder now for Beane to continue to be successful because this book shows how he has managed to do this. I don't think so, in fact I think in some ways he wants the rest of the world to know how he has done all this. He secretly wants recognition for the way he has managed to beat \\"the system.\\"<br />Not only a look at an unconventional way to run a baseball team, but this book is also a look at an unconventional way for anyone to successfully run any business. A fascinating read.
B000092ZYX|5.0|I have been anticipating this album for so long that I was afraid to be let down in a way.  Not a chance!  This album WILL go down as Radiohead's masterpiece and will forever change the way music is recorded.  Standout tracks are &quot;There,There&quot; and &quot;2+2=5&quot;.  Thank you Radiohead!
B000092ZYY|5.0|People have been talking so much about how this cd will either be a &quot;glorious&quot; return to RH's earlier, rockier styles, or it will permanently exile them from pop music charts as they plunge deeper into eclectic sonic experimentation and artistic grandstanding.  It's neither..  rather it is an exact and natural extension of the sounds they began hinting at with Amnesiac.<br />Kid A suprised the world with its electronic bleep-and-swirl jive, but Amnesiac was dismissed (by some) as just another set of songs from the same mould.  But Amnesiac showed Radiohead maturing in its use of autre, electronic jiggery pokery into fluid natural textures, making use of them just as they do any other instrument, witnessed in &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; and &quot;Spinning Plates&quot;  both of which are heavily doused in electronics but sound as if they could have come from any decade in modern music.<br />Hail to the Thief takes this concept further and shows a band very comfortable with who they are and their abilities.  They no longer feel the need to experiment so deeply to show their &quot;artsiness&quot; and as a result, simply rock.  But don't expect them to &quot;Bends rock&quot; or even &quot;OK Computer rock&quot; for that matter.. this band may be comfortable playing real instruments again, but they are definately not stupid enough to backtrack or devolve musically.  The songs here comprise a certain angst that seems so true to todays world, full of lyrics about self-doubt, insecurity, mistrust in others, and the choice of whether to become involved, or watch it at home on the television.  We need this album today, and we need Radiohead today, to be telling their message.  There are many more radical bands out today, many with harsher views or more personal involvement.  But no band as popular as this even comes close to having the balls to name a cd &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; at a time when country stars get blackballed for simply not liking George Bush.  Their mission goes well beyond him though, and is a wake up call to everyone in the world, in their comfy homes, to realize what is going on.<br />To all the people who wish for a return to their simpler roots, would you have wished for the Beatles to make another &quot;Meet the Beatles&quot; directly after &quot;Sgt. Peppers?&quot;  Would music be the same today if they had reverted?  I don't think so.  Despite sentimental value, Bends-era Radiohead isn't coming back... and this is a good thing in the long run.  Nothing can survive long if it doesn't adapt, change, or evolve, and this is especially true for popular bands today.mission goes well beyond him though, and is a wake up call to everyone in the world, in their comfy homes, to realize what is going on.  <BR>To all the people who wish for a return to their simpler roots, would you have wished for the Beatles to make another &quot;Meet the Beatles&quot; directly after &quot;Sgt.

B00008LDPU|4.0|CREATIVITY and intellectual brain-play is marvelous in this collection - and if you are a philosophy fan, you will enjoy it immensely. No point in reviewing each separately - other reviews posted here do a fine job of that.  But do watch for the complexity of the philosophical references, plus those to religion, world history (My Lai and the Holocaust being merely two dominant ones), ethics, postmodernism and modernism, and the like.  Some are quite obvious (Michael Karl Popper, in Kid's Story, for example...)  OThers are more subtle... half the enjoyment is realizing they're there!<br />Creativity and intriguing intellectual flair make this a winning combination full of WONDER -- watchable again and again because one sees and realizes more each time.
0316776963|4.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is David Sedaris' very funny look at himself through both his family and his time in France.  The good news that his sister's comedy, Strangers with Candy, is coming out on DVD made me pick this book up again and remember all over what a truly Talented Family this is (and Amy's appearances in David's essays are amongst the funniest sections, outside of the David learning French, of course).  These essays seem fresh on second and third helpings.  Since the first time I read this I have finally heard many of them on NPR and now can read them with the author's rather distinctive voice in my head.  Now my brain is, sadly, changing all commerical jingles into rather nasally, high-pitched Billie Holliday-emoting songs.  That may not be a blessing but this book is and will always be.
B0000399WI|5.0|It has long been my contention that it is the moviemaker's task to hold the viewer's attention, not to burden him with his self-indulgent, difficult-to-follow symbolisms. <br />That having been said, I find it difficult to find another movie I would recommend more highly than The Shawshank Redemption. Without any high-adrenaline action sequences or steamy sex scenes (two sure-fire ways to get the vewer's attention), this film somehow has the power to make you sit through all 142 minutes without for a moment getting bored. And I challenge anyone who has seen it to delete any scene, even any minute, from the final edit. The fact is, you can't. Because every single scene is an essential element that contributes to the final result: a masterpiece that captures the drama of enduring friendship and resiliency of the human spirit more powerfully than any other film ever made. Even those who normally do not watch movies with a critical eye will find themselves so drawn into this experience. I really can't say enough about this film. Suffice it to say that this is certainly the Greatest Movie Not to Win an Oscar. (Since Citizen Kane, at least. )<br />Actually, I can forgive the Film Academy for not honoring this film with the Oscars I firmly believe it deserved. But when the American Film Institute in 1998 put together their list of The 100 Greatest Movies of all time (covering the period from 1896-1996), and so myopically overlooked Shawshank in favor of such titles as Rocky, Dr. Strangelove, Network, and Jaws, well, I thought that was absolutely ridiculous.<br />I wouldn't hesitate to put it in the top five of all time.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Oops!...I Did It Again is Britney Spears' second release.  Following the unbelievably successful ...Baby One More Time - the debut album that propelled Britney to super-stardom - this CD goes to show you that addictions can grow stonger, making them hard to get rid of.  While assumed rival Christina Aguilera went on her three year break before the 2002 release of Stripped, Britney won over her fans with her naughty, yet innocent girl-next-door image.  Oops!...I Did It Again is pretty much a clone of her first release, but (unsurprisingly), it became more of a hit than her debut album did with fans.  There's an annoying thingwith this CD, though (as if Britney's voice and the lame ballads aren't bad enough) - the lyrics featured on this CD, just like ...Baby One More Time, it seems that Britney only releases lyrics from the songs she likes.  Despite that, here are my ratings for Oops!...I Did It Again.<br />1) \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" - (4.5/5) - The first release as well as the title track of this album, Britney does what she did with her first album.  With the release of ...Baby One More Time, the first release was the title track - which became a national phenomenom.  It looks like did it again.  With her voice being virtually enhanced on the song on this very upbeat song along with its steamy video, Britney once again had an instant hit under her belt.  This is without a doubt the twin sister song of \\"...Baby One More Time\\".<BR>2) \\"Stronger\\" - (4/5) - The twin sister song of \\"(You Drive Me) Crazy\\", this upbeat song without a doubt strongly reminds you of \\"Crazy\\".  This upbeat song shows a 'stronger', independent Britney.  Stronger in record sales, maybe.<BR>3) \\"Dont Go Knockin' On My Door\\" - (1/5) - Uck.  This song is horrible.  Again, words can't describe how horrible it is.<BR>4) \\"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\\" - (1.5/5) - With the cover of the original Rolling Stones' hit, when it comes down to Britney, this is the twin sister song of her 1999 song \\"The Beat Goes On\\".  It seems Britney can't cover a popular person's music without lowering its popularity and making a fool of herself.<BR>5) \\"Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know\\" - (4.5/5) - This is a very, very Pop-ish love song - but Britney gives it her all.  And the results are \\"Wow.\\"  When Britney puts effort into her music, she can deliver a sexy, yet very, very beautiful ballad. ...Wait.. what!? Shania Twain and husband R.J. \\"Mutt\\" Lange wrote this song? Wait! Don't go onto the next song yet! Okay, that might explain why it's actually a good song, not to mention the male back-up singer that comes in around the end of the song sounding like Tim McGraw - but very virtually Pop enhanced.<BR>6. \\"What U See (Is What U Get) - (4/5) - Why can't they just spell out 'you'? Oh well.  I like this song because it seems to give off a message - that if you're gonna love someone, you're gonna have to accept them for who they are.  That is a good message.  This upbeat song is pulled off nicely.<BR>7. \\"Lucky\\" - (2.5/5) - Borrowing from the first song \\"Oops!...I Did It Again\\" and featuring a horrible male choir, this song bombs.  The melody and the lyrics are horrible (when sung by Britney).  Max Martin shouldn't of risked letting Britney singing this song - this song could've acheived great success if he had someone with better vocal power.  But despite that, along with the rating, this song delivers a powerful message that \\"The person with the most things is truly the saddest.\\" So, if despite that, I'm gonna change my 1/5 rating to a 2.5/5 rating - only due to the message of the song.<BR>8. \\"One Kiss From You\\" (2.5/5) - Could you lay off the voice enhancers? This song sort of reminds me of her 1999 song \\"E-Mail My Heart\\".  This is an okay pop song - very pop.. Britney just can't stop pumping out these lame ballads.<BR>9. \\"Where Are You Now\\" - (1.5/5) - Britney tried her luck on this ballad.  If I were to listen to any \\"Where Are You Now\\" song (that were Pop), I'd listen to the Jessica Simpson version.  This song isn't a complete failure, but for some reason it's actually appealing.  I would change the rating of this song, but I feel something telling me not to.  Hm..<BR>10. \\"Can't Make You Love Me\\" - (1/5) - Enough horrible ballads, please!<BR>11. \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" - (2.5/5) - Written by Diane Warren.. this should be good.  This song is decent, but it could be a bit more upbeat.  For some reason, 3:01 into the song, the instrument invovled reminds me of Nancy Sinatra song featured on her official website.. how strange!<BR>12. \\"Dear Diary\\" - (1.5/5) - With a melody that's Whitney Houston material, this 2:46 length song is pretty much boring as your listen to Britney singing to her Diary about how she met a boy and how she can't wait for to see him again.  Luckilly, though, she won't - this is the final song on this CD.<br />Overall, I'm raiting Oops!...I Did It Again with 3 out of 5 Stars.  With its highlights, along with the nearly decent song \\"When Your Eyes Say It\\" (only because Diane Warren wrote it), and its abundance of horrible ballads, Britney's 2000 release doesn't have much to offer.  The Princess of Pop's 3rd release didn't go so well either, but there's little backlash to it.  All of Britney's fans are now anticipating her fourth CD release scheduled for release later in 2003.  Britney, you have your faults, but you're still a powerful force in the music biz.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is up with the best albums Radiohead have produced. It's nothing like the bends or ok computer, more like a slightly more traditional amnesiac. The cover art's just as good as usual, it's worth buying for this even if you have the incomplete version (there's not much difference) that was leaked on the net.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt blends eastern and Celtic influences wonderfully in this album. She incorporates such eastern instruments as tabla, oud, and shawm along with the very Celtic bodhran, harp, and tin whistle, yet they they blend together beautifully.<br />She draws on literature as well as religious traditions to craft her lyrics. They are thoughtful and lovely whether she wrote them herself or borrowed something that inspired her.<br />\\"Mummer's Dance\\" is a celebration of the Earth and her seasons. She has set a fragment of a traditional English May Day song into her words. The hurdy gurdy that accompanies it evokes a ritualistic, ancient feeling.<br />\\"Skellig\\" tells of the passing of a monk who has spent years of dedicated work copying and illuminating manuscripts. It brings to mind the monks who laboured to create the Books of Kells, as well as Saint Francis, with it's mention of the monk's love for a mouse and bird, his only companions, and the appreciation shown for nature.<br />\\"The Highwayman\\" is a classic poem of ill fated lovers. McKennitt's music wonderfully conjures images of the ghostly moon, and purple road trailing over the moor.<br />The beautiful \\"Dante's Prayer\\" draws it all to a wonderful, meditative close.
0156027321|2.0|I thought it was painfully unfunny, misleading about zoology and snide about faith. Many zoo tigers spend their lives pacing a small area until they get euthenized or worse to make room for baby tigers and the bigger crowds and revenue they draw. And I never expect good things when a discussion of faith starts off with the guy declaring his spiritual development is better than that of many people. I hope the Booker will resume honoring better titles.
B000002UJQ|4.0|Radiohead is very good at what they do. The question is, What do they do? Sentimentality and plenty of. This is my opinion maybe many people like all this sentimentality but I get a little tired of it. No album should be able to tug at the heartstrings like this, it should not be allowed. I like The Bends better.
B00008LDPU|5.0|If you like the Matrix and Reloaded you will love Animatrix.  The shorts cover everything, from the machine rebellion to a story about a woman who lost her cat.  She found the cat in a run down area where there was a programming glitch.  The children of the 'hood gathered around to play in the lack of gravity.  This was the programming glitch.  Cannot tell you anymore or else I would spoil it for you.
0156027321|4.0|Don't want to spoil the end though. Starts out somewhat slow but its not too hard to trudge through it. Very interesting in case you would like to find out how to survive sharing a life boat with a Begal Tiger in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.  Take my word for it: the ending will blow you away. Read it if only for that.
B00008S2VG|5.0|God forbid she have an opinion about America...Oh, I forgot...having an opinion is Anti-American...my bad...wake up, people...this album rocks.
B00008CLOA|4.0|i'd prefer to give it 4 1/2 but aparently thats not possible. Intensly trippy, the wizard of oz thing works but it is just a coinsidense. At first Time, money and the last two interconnected songs stick out as memorable however after listening to it incessantly with and without headphones you come to appreciate just about every moment. Now my favourite part is Any Colour you Like [?] pure intrumental but awesome. They were, i think, the greatest psycadelic band and this was, i think, their greatest album.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This guy is soon to be a household name.  It's incredible that this record is just getting a U.S. release, having been out in Ireland for over a year.  Damien Rice picks up where Jeff Buckley left off, and reminds us what great songwriting is all about.  Haunting, beautiful, heartbreaking and hilarious, all at the same time.  Enough said.  Get this record and go see this guy play live.  You will be blown away.
6305603847|2.0|I rented this thinking that it would be entirely trippy cartoons like in fantasia except with the freedom of modern art. But alas no. It tries to set a movie to the album with a few songs missing and one extra. Ok i love the album it is magnificent but by putting a movie to the music you don't get the chance to actually listen, the scenes get kind of drawn out and repeatitive. The cartoon snippets are awesome yes but the take a back seat to the predominent live action parts.<br />     It is the story of Roger Waters so you got to feel for him a bit, it tells his story but why mix that with the music and inserted trippy cartoons.
0671027379|1.0|I try to avoid reading novels that are even remotely political.  Why?  Becuase almost to the person, an author will describe a Republican as either a dumb huckster, or a malicious, conniving, sneaky, self serving jerk.  I decided to try an author, new to me, whose reviews are good.  I encounter this stereotype within the first five pages.  Ahh, all is fiction.  The mindset is immediately predictable.  I will try to read this book already knowing the evil that lurks behind the character of Sinister Senator Sedgewick Sexton. He's the REPUBLICAN primary winner. And his political persuasion just had to be pointed out.
B00005V9HH|3.0|It's a one shot deal, don't buy this movie, rent it. maybe watch it a second time while keeping an eye out for all the clues, but that is no real way to watch a move. Maybe scene by scene. It was really good, and quite original yet still ultimatly forgettable.
B000092ZYX|5.0|If you're a fan of Radiohead, buy this now.  If you're not, this may be a bit hard to get into, but at the same time it may be the best summation of what this band is about.  Progressive rock mixed with various boundary-bending elements such as tricky rythms, complex harmonies, brilliant new sounds, and lyrics conveying mixed emotions.  All of this with still beautiful, simple melodies.  <br />While not as groundbreaking as Kid A, it is an excellent record all around.  Every song has it's own little surprises backed by solid songwriting, making for a constantly enjoyable experience. Radiohead never simply rely on a bag of tricks-the writing is always new and strong.   <br />And if this record sounds too political for you, it really isn't.  The lyrics are very metphorical, not too specific.<br />All in all this is a fun record with songs that have made Radiohead an excellent paradox-the music is lonely, sad, and dark yet it lifts you to heights no other band can come close to.
0783229526|5.0|I've both read this book and seen the movie and in my honest opinion the mind of Hunter S. Thompson filtered through the mind of Terry Gilliam only increases the truthful insanity the original book was peppered with. I liked the movie better as a work of art more yes. Still that was just me and many people i've watched this with just hated it (so did ebert) but that doesn't matter you either get it or you don't. When i watched it as a kid i hated it to but id like to think that i've grown. Maybe prior experiance with drugs is required that might help too.<br />  All reviews are subjective anyways if you are not like me maybe you could not but hate it.
B00004YZFR|1.0|I dislike this film/documentary so much because of what it could have been..really..the Hell with Altamont! Stones fans want to see the Stones play, play, man!! Especially with the Mick Taylor line up. When he joined the band--the Stones suddenly became a<br />Serious band. What did they do before and after Sticky Fingers and Exile? a few gems here and there? He even put his stamp on Let it Bleed (although Kef' did do most the the lead work on that--amazing!). I hope there is footage out there of this tour--and the Stones take a hint from the Mighty Zepplin and release all that we only get glimpses of in this boring snoozer that you have to keep your finger on the FF button for.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Yet anothor great one<BR>i got my copy today and after a listen i can see how they returned to the &quot;ok computer&quot; days yet they kept some electronic elements....but not as much as it was in &quot;Kid A&quot; <BR>this one is yet more easy to get into than both &quot;Kid A&quot; or &quot;Amnesiac&quot;<BR>There is a glimps of hope and brightness in this album that is not available in the other previous ones<BR>they just keep getting better and better....they grow with each album<BR>4 stars cause i liked it better than &quot;Amnesiac&quot;....yet there is nothing new they haven't done here before
B00008BXJF|5.0|Once again, the originators of \\"art rock\\" have created a gem of a concept album. \\"The Power to Believe\\" is perhaps Crimson's best release since \\"Beat\\" (1982). <br />For me, this was unexpected, because I considered the performances on \\"Thrak\\" and \\"Construktion of Light\\" to be somewhat inconsistent (even though both are great albums). I wasn't sure if K.C. would ever get back to its old form again. As several other reviewers pointed out, \\"The Power to Believe\\" appears to be the album where the band's new line up - including Trey Gunn on warr guitar and Pat Mastelloto on drums - has finally \\"gelled.\\"<br />At times, \\"The Power to Believe\\" sounds like the old, pre-\\"Discipline\\" King Crimson (perhaps in the 1973 to 1975 period). At other times, it sounds like the Crimson of the early 80s. And at other times, it sounds completely new - i.e. a continuation of the direction the band was taking with \\"Thrak\\" and \\"Construktion of Light.\\" <br />The amazing thing about it, though, is that it is incredibly cohesive. The tracks all hold together amazingly well - whereas the band's previous two studio efforts seemed somewhat random and inconsistent - i.e. an assmblage of tracks that didn't really flow all that well. There was also some material on the two previous releases that was, well, bland - at least by King Crimson standards.<br />Like Crimson's pre-\\"Discipline\\" material, listening to \\"The Power to Believe\\" can be compared to taking a tour through an art gallery. Each track on this disc is like looking at an abstract painting. You may see many things in it - or you might sit there for hours, straining just to find something ... Keep your \\"Eyes (and ears) Wide Open.\\" New layers of detail are revealed upon each listen. This is a solid effort.<br />Yes, I do miss Bruford and Levin - but on this album, Gunn and Mastelloto have really come into the fold of the band - and each adds greatly to the band's sound. I'll admit that, for the most part, Gunn's \\"warr guitar\\" might as well bea bass - but he does add some interesting \\"groaning\\" sounds, not too unlike what Levin used to add. And Mastelloto has proven to be a monster of a drummer on this album: Rapid time signature changes are no problem for this guy - although you could argue his style is more geared to hard rock, compared to Bruford.<br />The tunes on \\"Power to Believe\\" range from wildly experimental to relatively straightforward. As I said earlier, some tracks sound like they were influenced by \\"Lark's Tongue in Aspic\\" or \\"Red\\" - while others sound like they are from the \\"Discipline\\"/\\"Beat\\" period. Still others are, well, completely new. On certain tracks, the band seems to have changed to a much heavier sound. For example, \\"Level 5,\\" \\"Facts of Life\\" and \\"Happy With What You Have to be Happy With\\" rock much harder than any Crimson I've heard during the past 10 years. <br />I love all the tracks - but, right now, my favorites are the ones with the heavy Adrian Belew influence. In particular, I love \\"Eyes Wide Open,\\" an absolute gem of a track (thank you Adrian!) which has enriched my life daily since I bought the disc. The others are \\"Facts of Life\\" and \\"Happy With What You Have ... \\" Never before has the band sounded so ... heavy. I mean, it's amazing. It's not metal - it's \\"angry\\" King Crimson. It's surprising to hear someone like Robert Fripp, at his age, rock this hard. <br />One reviewer said he thought the band was trying to appeal to a younger set by creating this heavier sound - but I see no effort here to appeal to a wider audience. The tunes are way too complicated - way too \\"1970s progressive\\" - to be considered \\"mainstream.\\" Like other Crimson releases, this one takes several listens to get used to ... let alone to understand. It is an album that one must develop a personal relationship with. It will surely join the ranks of the other \\"classic\\" King Crimson albums.<br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I never had a chance to hear the EP (\\"Happy With What You Have ...\\") that preceded the release of \\"Power to Believe.\\" All I can say is, I hope Crimson continues to do what they do best - coming up with well-conceived, well-written and amazingly complex music that defies categorization. I also hope they continue to pump out creative \\"concept\\" albums like this one, where all the tracks hold together and the album takes on its own identity. If you love Crimson, you're gonna love \\"The Power to Believe.\\"
B000092ZYX|5.0|This album is amazing. It's fascinating to watch their progression from the Bends to Hail to the Thief and to hear the way their sound has evolved. This album is the perfect cross between OK Computer and Kid A. Every good thing about both those albums has been combined to creat Hail To The Thief. Once again Radiohead has offered up a real work of art. Old fans of Radiohead will really appreciate it, and its accessible to new fans as well.

B00003CY0V|1.0|This movie is a discgrace. Shame on you Travolta !!! Of course, we couldn't expect much more from Hugh Jackman, considering his extremely limited abilities as an \\"actor\\". The only thing in this movie worth seeing is Halle Berry, you know what scene I mean. Other than that, this movie has a crummy plot, horrible acting, and the special effects are not that good either....crummy, even for an action movie!!! Save your money and buy some toilet paper instead, because thats about all this movie is good for.
0553573403|5.0|&quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; is a rich saga with splendid characters and an intricate plot. This book is EXCELLENT. A must read for anyone who likes character-driven stories and rich world with well developed political and historical structures. Very highly recommended!
B000092ZYY|5.0|Another great album by a great band.People have learnt to expect great albums from this band and even though this is not as groundbreaking as OK Computer or Kid A(am i asking for too much!) its a very good album with very good songs.With a combination of guitars and effects it probably sounds liked something between OK and Kid A.Wouldnt recommend it for first time listeners but Radiohead fans will love it.
B00008LDPU|1.0|I was excited to get to see this dvd when i first heard about it, however, when i watched it with my friends we all decided that with the exception of Final Flight of the Osiris, the dvd [stunk].  this adds nothing to the story that surrounds the matrix.
B000092ZYY|4.0|As of late, I've become quite the die-hard Radiohead fan.  Sure, I've heard their work long before now, but only recently have I really discovered the greatness of both the band's music and art, and even more so when combined properly, such as their 4th release, \\"Kid A\\".  When I heard that Radiohead had released a brand new studio album, I had to hear it.  So, now I've purchased it, listened to it, and was prepared to think about it and listen to it again, when I realised that, unlike any of the band's more recent work, \\"Hail To The Thief\\" is not hard to grasp.  In fact, I was almost insulted that Radiohead had released another \\"pop\\" album...it's almost as if they're pandering to their \\"Bends\\"-era crowd.  I wanted a challenge...I wanted another Kid A....I wanted mood and emotion, not riffs and catchy hooks.  In fact, I'm probably one of the few fans who likes the song \\"Kid A\\" more than anything Radiohead has ever released.   It's music that puts you somewhere else and locks the door for a good hour-or-so.  It gets in your head, man.  <br />However, \\"Hail To The Thief\\" is not a bad album. It's not even sub-par Radiohead at all.  In fact, some of these songs are downright brilliant.  \\"There There\\", the album's single, for instance, has become my favorate song overnight.  And, as always, Thom Yorke's surrealistic lyrics fill your head with images that make you want to listen to these songs over and over again.  <br />The only reason I gave the album 4 stars out of 5 is the fact that I bought the special edition of \\"Hail To The Thief\\", and I was annoyed, and...almost pissed that there was almost no now-infamous radiohead artwork inside.  It did come with a poster, but it looks a lot like the cover.  I was hoping to see mutated cardboard mountainscapes or evil bears with guns or something.   But no, I get the lyrics.  Whoopie.<br />So, yeah, I'd recommend \\"Kid A\\" or \\"OK Computer\\" if you really want to see Radiohead for who they truely are, but \\"Hail To The Thief\\", Kid A's sober little brother, is well worth the listen.
0140277447|5.0|Excellent book - It tells some of the saddest and most horrible  war crimes during World War II committed by the Imperial Japanese military.  The sad true is that Japanese government still has not offically apoloized to the Aisa countries for its war crime.  I highly recommend this book for everyone and hopefully history would not repeat itself.
B000092ZYY|4.0|this cd is quite awesome.  the first track (\\"2+2=5\\") starts off with the guitar getting plugged in, and that's pretty rad.  the whole cd is good, but i wouldnt say its as good as \\"The Bends\\" or \\"Ok Computer\\". either way its a good cd.  if your a die-hard radiohead fan, get the special edition one. it has a free poster and it comes in its own unique way.(youll know what im talking about if you get it.)  if your just a fan that likes \\"creep\\" and/or \\"optomistic\\", then get the normal edition.
B00008PX8P|4.0|Much of the music on this DVD is brilliant - but a disasterous set at MSG keep this DVD from being rated 5 stars.<BR>The highlight of this two-disc set is at the beginning - the early footage at Royal Albert Hall. This is the band before they could coast on their name, and before the myth of their shows overgrew the reality. What carries this performance is Robert Plant - he's in excellent voice, and hits every note the songs call for (something, we learn, he did not always do, particularly as he aged). The stage presence of the band is superb, and they tear through a heavy, but upbeat set of songs, strutting the entire way. The pace slackens for the long instrumentals - Dazed and Confused drags a bit (though the violin bow is cool) and Moby Dick, though certainly confirmation of Bonham's skills, is not particularly enjoyable. One exception is Page's phenomenal \\"White Summer\\".<BR>The first set of note on the second disc is at MSG - easily the worst in the collection. Plant seems to be content to shout the words, and rely on audience sing-a-longs to save himself from actually working. Page's constant points to the audience seem more like a flashy show-trick than anything else. They go through a set of great songs, but play none of them well.<BR>The show at Earl's Court shows Plant learning how to sing with his diminished range. The acoustic set is superb, with an amazing \\"Going to California\\", and their rendition of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" does not disapoint the lofty expectations one may have, despite the fact that Plant is clearly no longer capable of shrieking the final verse.<BR>The Knebworth footage is a mixed bag - Plant's singing and the band's playing are solid, and the songs are quite good. Of particular interest is the dark and almost somber tack that Plant takes with the usually boisterous \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". The one drawback is that the band LOOKS old and tired. Apparently Bonham died soon after this show. Watching the DVD, one is waiting for him to keel offof his drum stool, he had physically deteriorated so much. Compared to the raw power and cohesion from Royal Albert Hall, the band seems too polished and tame - almost like they would have broken up soon even had Bonham lived.<BR>Overall, the DVD does a good job of capturing the arc of Zeppelin's career. The Royal Albert Hall footage and the Earl's Court footage shine enough to make this DVD a vital purchase to any true Led Zeppelin fan.
0385504209|3.0|This is not a book for theologists, art historians, academics, or intellectuals.  It is for curious, reasonably intelligent people who can admit that they know very little about Leonardo Da Vinci or religious history, even if they are well-educated in other subjects.  If this describes you, then \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" may just blow your hair back, and hopefully entice you to go out and explore other (ahem, better, more well-researched) books on these topics.<br />Brown does succeed in presenting ideas and theories most of us have never considered or even heard about, and it has the potential to challenge an average person's religious views and beliefs.  I found some of it downright fascinating, but as I told my father (who gave me the book), I wish he had simply written a nonfictional essay, outlining his various theses--however \\"half-baked\\" they may seem to those religious scholars out there--in similarly simplistic language (ie. layman's terms) for those of us who are less knowledgeable but still fascinated.<br />What I do admire about Brown as a writer is his ability to reach a large number of people from vastly different walks of life.  By veiling his sentiments (however thinly) in a popular fictional genre (however awkwardly), he has attempted (and succeeded, judging from the sheer number of reviews on Amazon.com) to \\"spread the word\\"--a strange new gospel of Dan, if you will.  As a composer in a decidedly unpopular musical genre, I can appreciate that accomplishment for what it is.  Having said that, I cannot recommend \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" as great fiction.  Read it if you love art but don't know it; read it if you are fascinated by religion but not religious; heck, read it if you are on vacation (I was) and you need a fun read at least two steps above Danielle Steele.  But most importantly (and I say this about most things in life, because nobody has the answers), read it with a grain of salt!  Ideas are just ideas, however dramatic, explosive, and offensive they may seem.  Think of this book as speculative cocktail conversation, with a few exaggerated Hitchcockian details thrown in for spice.  We all enjoy that from time to time.they may seem.

B00003CXAA|4.0|It seems rediculous to me that they won't sell these as individual units and it is not like they don't stand alone nicely bythemselves.<br />No need to talk about the movie but the DVD features are pretty nice.  Coppola's commentary is a nice change from the usual self congratulatory fluff we often get.  Also am I alone in liking one person commentaries?  The making of feature is decent but and the family tree will help the Godbabies out.  <br />Sometimes I feel the nostalgic hype has outpaced the actual film but it stil holds up today even though the idea of the &quot;mob&quot; has been pretty much played out.  Are we supposed to like Mikey as he goes through his change?  Also it makes me sad to see Al Pacino in such amazing form as it reminds me of those people who &quot;peaked in 6th grade&quot;.  Yes he has had many fine perfomances since but how could you do better than Godfather II?  Also no matter what anyone says, Godfather III is not a good movie!!  Someone should of &quot;whacked&quot; it in production.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Y'know, for the life of me, I've never really understood why so many people latch onto the idea that OKC was \\"normal,\\" Kid A and Amnesiac were \\"weird,\\" and any subsequent album has to be a return to the OKC style. Trout Mask Replica is weird...Kid A and Amnesiac found an excellent band toying with arrangements to songs to create an initially-alienating experience which, when broken in, revealed an excellent assortment of songs and ideas.<br />So what is the new disc, \\"Hail to the Thief,\\" then? Is it a \\"return to form\\" after those two experimental discs? Is that even the point?<br />Not really. What you need to know is this: Hail to the Thief is excellent. Radiohead decided, this time around, to \\"road-test\\" their songs (a la Zappa) with a series of limited concert dates late in 2002; the songs, according to the band, which got the best reactions were fine-tuned, and recorded in a marathon 2-week session for the album.<br />What's the result? Well, for one thing, \\"Thief\\" is Radiohead's least-\\"produced\\" album for quite some time; there are remarkably few \\"shimmering soundscapes\\" this time around, and most of the arrangements are decidedly performable by a band live on stage (unsurprisingly). If anything, that's the change in approach for \\"Hail to the Thief;\\" while OKC, Kid A, and Amnesiac sounded like they had been labored-over *in* the studio, \\"Thief\\" sounds like it has been labored over *for* the studio. Which it has.<br />And the approach works, because the songs are great. Some might quibble that their favorite tracks from the 2002 tour didn't get included (most advocate for \\"Up on the Ladder,\\" but I was curious to see what could be done with \\"Wicked Child\\"), and I'm already seeing a negative reaction to the two \\"new\\" tracks (my advice: let them settle in), but this is some great, great material. \\"2+2=5\\" is the logical opener, with a great sense of dynamics, going from slyly accusing to all-out sound 'n fury. \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" and \\"Sail to the Moon\\" both deliveron all of the promise they showed during the 2002 tour. \\"Backdrifts\\" is one of the new tracks, and *I* like it, at least; it's a Greenwood Bros. track, as far as I know, and it's quite excellent, with a very emotive chorus and *lots* of nice effects. I also like \\"Go To Sleep\\" quite a bit, which gets pegged as \\"Bends-esque,\\" if that sort of thing appeals to you. <br />\\"Where I End And You Begin\\" has improved tremendously since the tour, growing out of its beginnings as a Cure-alike song and into something even more delightful. \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" (the lyrics to this seem to be among the band's favorites, as they've been used in almost every advertising campaign so far) is the first of the album's two vaguely-\\"horror\\" tracks, and is great...the very idea that handclaps can be \\"sarcastic\\" is explored to great effect. I like \\"The Gloaming\\" slightly less than \\"Backdrifts,\\" but it appears that nobody on earth agrees with me; in any case, it's still an excellent song, and the editing done for the real release does tighten it up a bit. \\"There There\\"...you probably know this by now. \\"I Will\\" would have been fascinating to hear in its original Like Spinning Plates incarnation, but is still touching, with some stark, dry vocals...pity it lost its intro. \\"Punch Up at a Wedding\\" is a great bit of drunken, subverted funk, with some excellent Thom harmonizing. \\"Myxomatosis\\" be fierce! And \\"Scatterbrain\\" and \\"Wolf\\" are two great album closers.<br />And in grand contrast to many currently-released albums, Radiohead manages to mostly avoid the trend of having their audio squashed beyond recognition. \\"Thief\\" is still a bit uncomfortably compressed in a few places (\\"2+2=5\\" is a bit on the border), but it isn't album wide (\\"We Suck Young Blood\\"), and in general the thing has a fairly large amount of dynamic range, especially for today. Hooray! Let this trend take over, please...\\"louder\\" is not always better in a CD-Audio sense.<br />Two caveats, however. In one way, \\"Thief\\" does harken back to the days of The Bends in one important way: it's the least \\"integrated\\" of all of Radiohead's albums since that time. For those who complained that Amnesiac didn't flow as well as Kid A as an album, well, \\"Thief\\" doesn't even really try to; gone are the segues which marked OKC, Kid A, and Amnesiac, as \\"Thief\\" only really tries this once (between \\"I Will\\" and \\"Punch Up\\"), and even then it's kinda half-hearted. Not that \\"A Great Collection of Songs\\" is anything to scoff at, but those accustomed to Radiohead's albility to make a smooth, organic album That Could Not Be Possibly Listened To In Any Other Way might be thrown off, a bit.<br />Caveat two: apparently, the US version (which, if you're at amazon.com, is probably the one you're looking at) is the only version out there that consistently lacks copy protection. If you're considering buying your country's native version, remember to check out whether you're getting a REAL CD or something that vaguely approximates a CD first. Don't worry, this isn't the band's decision...that's what record labels are for.
B000069AUI|5.0|I had heard a few singles from the Parachutes album and knew that there was a band out there named coldplay but never cared much until I first heard Clocks. It may not be everyone's favorite but its a masterpiece. The piano is really fantastic. When I heard the whole album a couple of times there was no looking back. They deserve more than 2 grammies and I just hope they continue like this. Coldplay and Radiohead rock!<br />I have all the songs they have ever sung and I can never get enough of it. For all the coldplay fans who haven't heard &quot;I ran away&quot; (unreleased), try and grab it. Its one of my personal favorites!
B0000039LE|5.0|This would have to be one of the alltime scary movies.The role<br />of Michael Meyers steals the film. Meyers escapes from an insane asylum and returns home. His doctor played by Donald Pleasance<br />goes hunting for the evil Michael Myers. The villain of this movie starts killing the members of two groups of teenagers who<br />are celebrating Halloween.He is scary. After several killings by Meyers the movie comes to a conclusion. The doctor finally locates Meyers and shoots him several times blowing him off the balcony. The movie has a creepy ending with the supposedly killed<br />Michael Myers nowhere to be found.The music at the end of the movie is absolutely creepy. Jamie Lee Curtis in the role of the<br />babysitter does an exceptional role. This is a must see movie. Buy it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Theif is, in a nutshell, a bridge between The Bends / OK Computer, and Kid A / Amnesiac. It is as if you mixed both, and the best possible result came out. Hail to the Theif is a booming soundscape, and a whispered prayer. It is clear that there has been combination between their former styles and techniques on Hail, and they are beautifully combined in the masterpiece that is Hail to the Theif. This is one of the best Radiohead CDs thusfar, moving away from the Over-Production of Kid A and leaning back towards the former Progressive tones from OK Computer, and the melodies from The Bends. Buy it.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Diana Krall's smooth old-school stylin' makes this soundtrack an essensial album for any swank lounge. When the lights are dimmed and the martinis are flowing, this CD will move things along to the next level. Especially if that level needs to include slow dancing to perennial favorites.
B00003CX7L|5.0|This movie is hilarious! I just loved how they copied Star Wars near the end! And this movie has some very moving parts too. Like when Jessie tells her story about her owner and what happened to her. You actually don't have to be a kid to enjoy this film. I love Pixar Films and I can't wait to see what they make next!
B000092ZYX|4.0|I waited patiently, and finally, here it is.  The buzz was that this album would be more like The Bends and OK Computer (my two personal favorites).  Well, after my first few listens I'm finding that this is much more like Kid A - which isn't neccessarily a bad thing.  It's everything that was GOOD about the first half of Kid A.  It will definately take a few more listens for the music to soak in, but I immediately liked 2+2=5, Sail to the Moon (one of Radiohead's all-time best, I think), and There There (another one that will no doubt be on their Greatest Hits in a few years).  <br />It's heady stuff and very experimental - not as immediately accessable as The Bends and OK Computer, but the best albums are usually the ones that slowly work on you without your even knowing it.  Maybe by next week I'll have to change my rating from 4 stars to 5.
6303314015|5.0|I saw a lot of animated movies in theaters when I was little, but the one that stands out the most is &quot;The Lion King.&quot; This is my favorite Disney movie, and it's definitely on the list of one of my favorite movies ever. It has a wonderful story and wonderful music. You'll be singing Hakuna Mutata in your head long after the movie ends. All I can say is, if you haven't seen this Disney masterpeice, where have you been??? See it now!!
B00008YLV2|5.0|As an Army wife of some 30 years (now retired), I listened when my husband talked about war. He wouldn't watch most of the movies, called them 'rubbish', but shortly before he died in November, he saw &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;, and was visably moved. The military advisors, writers, director, and producers did a magnificent job. The actors brought the characters to life and along with all the kudos for the leads, please watch carefully the performance of William Fichtner as SFC. Sanderson. He got it all exactly right. Thanks Mr. Fichtner.
B00005YUNY|4.0|The sound quality is absolutely amazing.  The sound of Jon Anderson's voice is even clearer than on any of the studio (and live) albums i have on CD. (From Yes to Topographic.) The musicianship of Yes and the orchestra is wonderful.  Steve's &quot;bad guitar tone&quot; didn't take away too much from the experience, although i'm not a guitarist or a guitar connoisseur by any means.    The animations can be toggled on or off, which is good, because they aren't very entertaining.  And the animations during Gates of Delirium are terrible.  I don't have any other Yes concert videos (unless you count the Special edition EP, aka best of Musikladen Live) so i don't have much to compare it to as far as Yes videos go.  But it is the best concert video (from any group) i've ever seen.  Steve Howe is awesome, and unintentionally hilarious.  The only bad bit is Chris Squire, who is a great bassist, but has an annoying over-emphatic stage presence.  Jon acts very strangely and hippyish.  <BR>Good disc.  The Magnification tracks are bad.  But good disc.  Get it.
B00006LLNU|5.0|This CD, in my mind, is one of the best CDs I own.  It is atmospheric and makes me visualize some kind of a wierd landscape that I would never be able to find here on Earth.  And in this landscape the people speak Hopelandic.  Jonsi, the singer of Sigur Ros, has made up his own language to accompany this strange utopian music.  The words have no defined meaning; they only have the meaning that each person gives them.  Hopelandic is not a language.  It's an artform.  In fact, the band decided to put no lyrics, CD notes, etc. inside the cover.  Instead they would rather have the listener write, draw, do whatever they want to where the lyrics of each song should be.  All other bands use the music to accompany a voice, but this is definitely not the case.  The music is already there, and with it comes the eery sounds of Hopelandic.    This is not only a beautiful and artistic album, it's an album meant to inspire beauty and art as well.  If you are not ready for this kind of inspiration don't buy this album.  If you are....the first time you put it in your CD player listen to it with headphones, in a warmly lit room, and listen to it in its entirety with no interruptions.  Do this and you'll want to listen to it over and over again.
B000089RVX|5.0|Where to begin...as many others, I was a big fan of the song \\"Bring Me to Life\\".  I purchased the cd for that sole reason, but soon had a change of heart.  EVERY and I mean EVERY song on this cd is so powerful.  I cannot stop listening to it.  I have owned the cd for several months now and have not gotten tired of listening to it almost everyday.<br />Any of you that get the opportunity to see this band live in concert...you are denying yourself if you do not go.  They put on a great concert.<br />I'm anxious to see future works from this band.<BR>ENJOY!!!
0385335482|4.0|Meet Becky and her shopping problem.  She has a job working for a financial magazine that she doesn't enjoy and it doesn't even come close to paying off her shopping expenses.  Yes, she is a little too materialistic, but everyone has times where they just HAVE TO HAVE those new pair of shoes (or whatever you like).  Becky just likes everything that's sold...  She's insanely in debt, but finally is able to land herself a gig as a financial advisor to a talkshow.  You'll never guess who she tells off to get it either!  <br />It took a little while to get into this book, but all the letters you get to read from different debt collectors are a riot!  Stick with the book and you're going to love it!
0385504209|5.0|This is a novel of breathtaking quality and mind-blowing sophistication. Quite simply: brilliant!  Dan Brown weaves historical facts and architectural and religious wonders into a hard-hitting, fast-moving story, with twists at every turn.  I simply cannot believe anyone who claims to have figured out the ending of this book before the last chapter.<br />I won't rehash the story line, but will say that for anyone looking for a fantastic, fascinating story, this book is a must-read.  It is not a reference text, so those who are concerned with cross-checking every little detail of the story would do better to simply go to a library and study a history textbook.<br />Read this book.  You won't put it down...
B00000AFGM|5.0|I would of given it four stars but this album deserves better. When I first saw this album cover I was about to say never mind I'll just get into a different band but I didn't and boy am I glad I didn't. This album is awesome because of the look, the sound and the lyrics. There is no slow point on this album. All though it does not compare to Holywood or Golden Age it does blow Antichrist Superstar out of the water. If you like this album then you might consider getting the movie God is in the T.V. which has all of Manson's videos up to this point. Plus, it shows a lot of backstage footage of the tour and is awesome.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first heard of SoundGarden's Chris Cornell and the band of Rage Against the Machine teaming up, I could only think of being disapointed. I never actually understood what in the wold could bring these two together. I always been a SoundGarden fan but never one of Rage.<br />The first single from the albrum is \\"Chochce\\" or something like that. From the day i heard it i didnt like it. And never thought about buyting the album. But then i heard like a stone.<br />Like a Stone is probably a song I will never get over. I bought the Cd because of it. I listen to the album everyday and skip the first song. If you don't like Cochise don't let that stop you from buying this album. The whole album is an amazaing work of art. The best thing that happened to the band of Rage is they broke up with Zack and teamed with Mr. Cornell. If you likes Like a Stone you chould give Getaway Car a trey.... That has to be my favorite track in the album.<br />I made three of my closest friends listen to this album. These days all four of us have the album playing at home and in the car.<br />You should to!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Most Marilyn Manson fans would say that this album is his best I'm not one of them. I own every single Manson album released and I have to say that if you are new to his music you should go for Mechanical Animals or The Golden Age of Grotesque. This is still a very good album and if you like Pink Floyd's The Wall you may find this a lot darker but a very good concept album.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Well , they did it again , I was not expecting anything so good as this one , it is clear that this guys became the most progressive band of the mainstream arena and hopefully because of them others will gain popularity.<br />A step forward from the previous works and their  most solid achievement.<br />Now, if you are a sound explorer and would like to discover other bands as good and adventurous as Radiohead , try Porcupine tree &quot; Sky move sideways&quot; , Godspeed! yo black emperor , and what is for me the best discovery in years , Tempano &quot; the agony and the ecstasy&quot;<br />Happy listening.
B00005JM03|5.0|I may be a bit biased (My daily driver is a '67 Mini), but I think this is one of the best movies ever filmed.  I love a good heist, and was grinning from the first scene with Theron in the mini.  The driving and chase scenes are some of the most exhilerating ever caught on tape.  I have only seen it once, but I'm already on the waiting list to buy it.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!

B000092ZYX|5.0|This cd is absolutely incredible, a must have. Go get it now. It is probably their second best after OK computer. Quit reading and go buy it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Once again Radiohead absolutely reels me in with a new album. I expected nothing less of Radiohead, and they far exceeded my expectations as is the norm with every new album they put out. This one has to be my favorite of them all, because it takes elements from their last 3 albums (OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac). OK COmputer because it features a lot for guitar than the latter two albums mentioned, Kid A because there is a lot of electronic influence littered throughout the 14 songs, and Amnesiac because it carries on that melancholy (sp?) tone the whole Amnesiac album brought about. The combination of the elements from those 3 albums makes this album, in part, what it is. This album did nothing but astound me. In factm I stood in fromt of the record store for two hours before it opened just so I could buy their first copy, which happened. They thought I was weird. I am. Back on track, it's extremely hard to pick and choose favorites, but being a piano man myself, I would have to say that &quot;Sit Down, Stand Up&quot; and &quot;Backdrifts&quot; are my two absolute favorites because they both have some of the most hauting piano parts I've ever heard in my entire life. For fans of Radiohead, this album will be an immediate masterpiece. For the casual, once-in-a-while radiohead listener, this album will take some getting used to, especially if it took you a while ot get used to Kid A and Amnesiac, or even if you never got used to those two at all.
B0000640VO|4.0|If you're looking for a sweet movie that asks nothing of you but to enjoy watch this. Calming, charming, interesting....It just makes you smile.
6305508550|5.0|I don't remember the last time I laughed that hard... \\"Office Space\\" is a great flick, poking fun at daily life at the office. Its ironic and situational comedy is superb, and if you enjoy a good laugh, you love this film. I recently heart of an office-manager playing it for her staff during a meeting, to \\"lighten\\" everybody up. I think it did the trick! Find out what I mean. ;-)
B000069AUI|5.0|The main reason to bought this album was the song &quot;In My Place&quot;, and that I already owned Parachutes.  It's amazing how a group in 2 years can create a wonderful record.  All songs are fantastic, the lyrics are excellent, for example in &quot;The Scientist&quot; and others.  I usually carry this record in my car, and I love listen it when I have to drive for a long time, it's relaxing; this record have great beats, the piano in some songs is played excellent.<br />All I have to say, is that this record should be in any collection, and if you still don't have &quot;Parachutes&quot;, it's the perfect time to buy both.
B00008OWZC|5.0|This is rock and roll, period.  I must qualify my review by admitting that there are still a couple tracks on this album that I haven't listened to yet, because I've been too mesmerized by the DVD to give the album a thorough listening to.  But I've certainly heard enough to know that this album, together with the DVD, is definitely the biggest treat that rock and rollers will get this year.  Incidentally, I assume the reviewer below who prefers his live Duran Duran album is a joker.  He's got to be.  It's inconceivable that there could exist on this planet anyone so misguided, and if there was such a miserable wretch, surely he'd know better than to expose his unhappy condition.  So I assume we're dealing with a joker.
B00008NGHI|5.0|This CD sounds beautiful!! Even if you overlook the fact that Alison Krauss sings like a angel and Union Station has some of the most talented musicians in the world, this CD is still a wonderful recording. And the best part is that it's a hybrid which means I can listen to it in the car too. If ever there was a reason to get an SACD player, though, it's this album.
6305736650|5.0|Many critics consider this film one of the great ones.  Others think it is sentimental claptrap.  I hadn't seen the film in many years, and I had to see it again to make up my own mind. <br />I bought the DVD ... and looked at it just last week.  Hey, this is really a good film. The photography is excellent throughout. There are great, moody B&W shots, and certain images, such as Ingrid Bergman in soft focus, her hat slanted low over her brow, have become iconic.  Bogart drinking away his sorrows while Dooley plays \\"As Time Goes By\\" is a scene filled with dark shadows and lover's angst.  <br />The acting is superb.  Bogart and Bergman weren't just stars.  They can express emotion with the movement of their eyes or the gesture of a hand. They are fun to watch.<br />This was supposed to be just another studio film, or so the legend goes.  But it seems Michael Curtiz put more effort into this than one might expect.  It is impossible to find a false moment in this film.<br />The last time I saw Casablanca, many years ago, the print was scratchy and dirty.  The DVD version is bright and crisp.  I'm glad I revisted this old standard.

0345363132|5.0|This is the best of the historic fiction genre.  I cannot recall the last time I enjoyed a 900+ page novel so much.  The Sunne in Splendour is an historic novel about the War of the Roses and its players; its about Warwick, Edward, Richard, Henry the last, Lancastrian king, Marguerite d’Anjou, the Woodvilles, the Nevilles, and the Tudors.  Having read Allison Weir’s history, The War of the Roses, and having seen Shakespeare’s Richard III, I thought I knew a bit about both the story and the players.  But I never quite saw them the story in this light.<br />One reviewer described this book as daring.  I agree.  Unlike Shakespeare, and the histories written by Tudor sycophants, Penman (through historic fiction) portrays Richard sympathetically, and heroically.  She represents his claim to the throne as legitimate and creates a plausible alternative to disappearance of the princes in the tower, one in which Richard is quite innocent.  <br />This is a story full of power struggles, warfare, greed, and avarice.  It is a story full of malice, politics betrayal, murder, and yes love.   <br />Is should be hard to care about people who lived in the 15th century, but it is not.  Sharon Kay Penman brings all of the characters and their many faces to life. She tells the story to the 30+ years of warfare.  We all know that history is written by the victorious. Five centuries after the events, Penman brilliantly gives Richard III a voice. <br />I highly recommend this book.
6302814359|5.0|First off let me state that I agree with some of the other reviewers about how sad it is to finally get a movie you've been waiting for to find that it's been molested by edits. With the re-release market the way it is these days I'm sure we'll see a better version someday. My review is based upon the film itself, not this DVD release.<br /><br />I think this movie is a fine addition to the Return of the Living Dead saga. My only complaint is that this film still doesn't have a special edition DVD release, much like the third installment. With cult films starting to make a rise in the DVD market perhaps we'll get the ones we want.<br /><br />The story followed the original a little too closely (almost a re-make for our two witless grave robbers), but I believe this creation was an attempt to work with what the original had to offer plus a larger budget. (if only slightly) Also, the original PG-13 release? I mean come on, when is Hollywood going to stop trying to make these movies family friendly. It's horror for crying out loud.<br /><br />Finally we get a DVD release....and a part four & five (barely).<br /><br />Answer to reviewer from Claxton,Tn:<br />This is not a sequel to Night of the Living Dead exactly...with that series you have.<br />Night of the Living Dead<br />Dawn of the Dead<br />Day of the Dead<br />Land of the Dead<br />soon....Diary of the Dead<br />(and yes.....severing the spinal cord/blow to the head was sufficient to destroy creatures)<br /><br />With Return of the living dead its easy.<br />Return of the living dead 1,2,3,4,5<br />(the approach of destruction for Zombies here was more realistic....for a movie anyway, lol....they couldn't be killed. After all they're already dead. Then they blew that storyline out of the water by making the Zombies easy to kill in four and five with simple bullets fired anywhere you wanted like a human (depending on which Zombie is being shot).....guess the people who made it never bothered to watch the first three) If you notice alot of the names associated with 4 & 5 seem to be of Eastern European origin. Most of the movies coming from that area these days are questionable at best. Sometimes the simplest stories can be screwed up by people who never understood it in the first place.<br /><br />The first ROTLD was actually intended to be a sequel to NOTLD, notice the ROTLD book was written by John Russo (uncredited in the film) whom wrote the NOTLD screenplay. I'm guessing that they later decided to spin it off in a new direction by just stating that the \\"real\\" Zombies in the cannisters gave them the idea for NOTLD.<br /><br />;-)astern European origin.

0385504209|5.0|Once I began this extraordinary book, I could not put it down. \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is so much more than a gripping suspense thriller. Dan Brown takes us beyond the main plot and leads us on a quest for the Holy Grail - a Grail totally unlike anything we have been taught to believe. With his impeccable research, Mr. Brown introduces us to aspects and interpretations of Western history and Christianity that I, for one, had never known existed...or even thought about. I found myself, unwillingly, leaving the novel, and time and time again, going online to research Brown's research - only to find a new world of historic possibilities opening up for me. And my quest for knowledge and the answers to questions that the book poses, paralleled, in a sense, the quest of the book's main characters. What a trip! What a read!<br />A violent murder is committed in the Louvre Museum. The museum's chief curator, who is also the head of a remarkable secret society that has existed since the death of Christ, is found dead and gruesomely positioned on the floor near The Mona Lisa. In the minutes before he died, this very complex man was able to leave clues for his daughter to follow. The daughter, a brilliant cryptographer, along with a famed US symbologist, follow her father's codes and leads, hoping that he will, through his death, finally tell her what he wanted to confide in her while he lived.  The secret society included members such as: Leonardo Da Vinci, Boticelli, Gallileo, Isaac Newton, Victor Hugo, Jean Cocteau, etc. These folks really Did belong to this society, which Really existed! This is when I first began my online search.<br />The mystery, or mysteries, take us through England, France and far back in time. We learn about the secret of the Knights Templar, and the symbolism in many of the world's most treasured paintings, as well as architectural symbolism in some of history's most sacred churches. Of course, we also learn who committed the murder and why - although this is almost secondary next to the real epic mystery the novel uncovers.<br />If there are flaws in the plot, I was too busy reading to discover any. That is probably the sign of a terrific book! The writing is excellent and the characters are a bit on the super-hero/heroine side, but who cares? Is what \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" proposes true? Well, the research is correct. The historical events and people explored in the book are real. But no one knows the Truth...nor will we ever, probably. I think that some things are meant to be a mystery. With all the world's diverse religions and each individual's belief in what is Divine - the  Truth would have to destroy the beliefs, hopes and lives of many of the world's population. So, perhaps, in the divine scheme of things, there are many more Truths than one. Don't take the book too seriously. Just read it and enjoy!his is almost secondary next to the real epic mystery the novel uncovers.<br />If there are flaws in the plot, I was too busy reading to discover any.

B00009V7P8|5.0|This is one of the best and most original cds I have ever heard, one of those rare albums that can bring tears to your eyes and chills to your spine. I can't compare this music to anyone else's. The use of classical and opera, the melodies, and the incredible voices of Damien, and of Lisa Hannigan who joins him on several tracks. It's not often music can be described as beautiful. This is. Do yourself a favor and buy this album.
B000092ZYX|4.0|Once again, Radiohead has completely defied convention and will receive great critical success for being the only top-selling band to continually produce such challenging, unconventional albums.  Upon first listen, although certain songs had their moments, only a single song stood out.  The reason that this song, \\"Myxamatosis\\", jumped out at me is that it pretty much reached through my car speakers and grabbed me by the throat. Trying to describe this song to other Radiohead fans, you may indeed find yourself \\"tongue-tied\\". This is the hardest rocking song that Radiohead has ever laid down.  Yes, the guitars are back on this album, but they are interwoven with experimental electronica that is sometimes hyperactive and at other times serene, not unlike Aphex Twin.  I hate to use the cliche that much of this music seems ahead of its time, but this would provide a nice soundtrack for humanity once the machines have really taken over.  Listen repeatedly, because each time through, you will find more to enjoy.  Some of this stuff comes so close to the edge that you have to wonder if Radiohead is playing a joke on the fans and critics alike.  Some songs may produce visions of an untouchable band secretly plotting, \\"let's see how far we can go before someone has the bollocks to say that they don't like a Radiohead record\\".  But, then something happens during that same song to remind you that this is a \\"Radiohead Record\\".  They can go as far as they'd like and we will follow them into the future.  In years to come, some may ask the question, \\"if you had to choose one record to listen to for eternity while ruthless machines slowly suck the energy from your being, what would it be?\\" The answer will undoubtedly be \\"Hail to the Thief!\\"
B000092ZYX|3.0|With rumours abounding on the internet months before the release of this LP, Radiohead return and all the gossip ceases. According to those rumours, it was supposed to be \\"harder\\", \\"different\\", \\"experimental\\", this, that, you name it. Well, guess what, it's none of the above, it's simply ...Radiohead and, in fact, not the best Radiohead we've heard.<br />     Seems to me that the band are struggling with themselves at this point. Because these are extremely talented musicians and together they've been lucky enough to develop a great chemistry,even when they're short on ideas their albums are still good. As is this one as well.<BR>    Good, in their case though, doesn't mean \\"special\\". \\"hail to the thief\\" might've easily been a great debut or a noticeable album for other bands but not for Radiohead. You hear it, you think \\"yup, it's good ole Radiohead\\" but it doesn't stick to your mind. <BR>    I can imagine that the die-hard Head fans might disagree but then again fans usually do and it takes a crisis of frankness to admit that their fave band have outted an album that's unspecial.<BR>    This simply doesnt cut it and it falls right in that row of albums that have followed \\"Ok computer\\" which all have great moments but just that, moments.<BR>   The good moments in this one are even fewer than they were on \\"Kid A\\" or on \\"Amnesiac\\". So much so that after half a listen i was already feeling kinda bored with what was going through my ears.<BR>   Before listening to the new RHead album i also listened to the new Mogwai which happens to top the \\"Hail to the...\\" by a wide margin.<BR>   Radiohead need to, hmm, reinvent themselves, refresh their ideas, maybe opt for something new, something extremely different than what they've done up to now. Easier said than done, and who cares, they already have cut their niche and probably they cant be bothered enough to explore any new territories.<BR>   Well, i kinda think that in case, the more they go like this the more less people will keep bothering with them.
B00005JLT5|1.0|A classical pianist surving the Nazi atrocities through the spirit of music-sounds like a great dramatic plot right? Well, it was miserable. Brody should be forced to give back the Oscar, Polanski should stick to flicks like The Ninth Gate, and we ALL knew how horrible the Nazi's were, shooting people in the head and just plain evil, no need to go over it and over it for 2 and a half hours here????!!!!!<br /> Brody's entire family is wiped out and you see him staggering down the streets weeping like Deniro in a comical way, as in Analyze This: the worst acting I've seen in a lond time, Brody's speech was better.<br /> If you want a killer flick about classical music and struggle, check out Immortal beloved, Amadeus, etc. Stay away from this one. And the DVD bonus features stunk on here also. Very dull.<br /> ZERO RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF DVD'S, USA.
B00005JLT5|3.0|This book should never have been made into a movie; the narration of the horros experienced by Wladyslaw Szpilman during the Nazi occupation of Poland was published soon after the war ended, and it constituted a powerful and frequently introspective story; I have not read the book, but the critique it has received from Amazon readers is uniformly good (nothing less than four or five star ratings). The truth is that some books simply cannot be transformed into successful motion pictures, and this apparently is one of them. It is an account of how events descended upon a man who remained a passive receiver of uncountable pain and horror; and how, in the end, he prevailed.<br />The ingredients that went into making this movie are all superb and beyond negative criticisms: the script is masterful and Roman Polanski directs with precision and meticulous concern for detail and nuance. Adrian Brody's performance reflecting his physical decay over time, and his increasing anguish, is certainly a tour de force of extraordinary acting. The film's theme of hope and of survival cannot be faulted. And so, why does the final product miss its goal, and become (dare I say it?) tedious? The clue, in Roman Polanski's own words, is this: \\"The events [Szpilman] describes are not written like a novel, they are written like a journal, and are therefore unfilmable.\\" Exactly. This film consciously attempts to resemble the newsreels of the day; and like newsreels (in general) it provides the visuals and the immediacy of action without furnishing the transformations that lead to truly great art. When my mind started wondering about what kind of lighting was it that made Mr. Brody's ample nose become translucent, and was this being done on purpose, the movie had obviously lost my attention.
B00005JLKN|5.0|The movie: killer. Almost as good as Silence of The Lambs, I thought. Norton is great and Hopkins still manages to bring new life (or death?!) into the sickly intelligent mind of Hannibal The Cannibal. <br /> The DVD: Even more killer! Great interview with Hopkins, inside the mind of a serial killer with an FBI profiler-the real life Norton who hunts these guys down-commentary and more. <br /> I grabbed this for a price of [money], I would have paid the retail [money] or whatever for it-it's that great. <br /> Happy viewing and be sure to watch this one the sound up, some superb effects bounce all over the room, as with any DVD. <br /> 5 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF HORROR DVD'S, USA.
B00008OWZC|5.0|When I first heard about this live album, I was more than a little skeptical. After all, if the performances were so great why weren't they used for a live album earlier?<BR>Well, it seems as if Mr. Page has been cleaning up these dirty bootlegs for the past two years and the result is a glimpse of one of the most influential bands in history at the very apex of their power. Stripped of all studio trickery, Page and his mates manage to thoroughly entertain an audience (two, actually) from opening note to final encore. I'm 43 and this album recalls my early concert-going days when bands (the good ones) really did try something new every night. The album also reveals how special American blues was to Page's development at this stage in his career. Recorded live right after the release of Houses of the Holy, this is a transitional period for the band...they are exploring the blues live a year before starting their more experimental studio album Physical Graffiti (an album that took 18 months of studio work). <BR>How the West Was Won is also notable for great acoustic songs like Bron Yr Aur Stomp, That's The Way and Over the Hills and Far Away. John Paul Jones plays some great keyboards and mandolin and John Bonham's drum playing easily shows why the band disbanded shortly after his death. <BR>This is a great live album in the tradition of the Allman's Filmore East, Zappa's Roxy & Elsewhere, and other good experimental electric blues discs from the early 70s. <BR>The 17-minute drum solo on Moby Dick is a little much but is necessary to put you in the 70s concert frame of of mind.
B00005OWEG|4.0|\\"Apocalypse Now\\" is a brilliant film, but the question here is whether \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" is an improvement on the original.  My answer is no, it is not.  I would rather have seen most of the extra footage treated as deleted scenes in a deluxe DVD edition that could have included commentary and perhaps even the \\"Heart of Darkness\\" documentary.  That way these scenes could have seen the light of day without intruding upon the integrity of the original film.  A Director's Cut is usually validated by the studio's insistence on the original vision of the film being altered, and that is not the case with Francis Ford Coppola and \\"Apocalypse Now.\\"<br />When I first saw \\"Apocalypse\\" now I found the ending rather anti-climactic, although I certainly appreciate it better today than I did the first time through.  My initial reaction was premised on the fact that the trip up the river to see Kurtz (Marlon Brando) was such a descent into hell that probably nothing they could have discovered at the end of the journey would have been as good as the set up.  For years I said my favorite part of the movie was from the time Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) got on the boat until they arrived at Kurtz's camp.<br />Most of the added footage of \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" comes during the journey and, for me anyway, consists of two extended segments that dispel the whole idea of descending into the metaphorical heart of darkness.  The first has Chef (Frederic Forrest) and Lance (Sam Bottoms) both hooking up with a couple of Playboy Playmates.  Having these rather bizarre sexual encounters undoes the whole scene of the sex-starved troops leering over the USO show and dispels the ever enveloping gloom that afflicts the group on their trip upriver.  The second has Willard at a bizarre dinner on a French plantation where he is lectured on the folly of American Imperialism by the owner (Hubert de Marais) and a beautiful woman (Roxanne Sarrault) walks around naked while spouting existential bon mots and tucking the captain in for the night.  Again, the additional scene alters the tone of the film and regresses the accumulating horror.<br />Those who consider \\"Apocalypse Now\\" now to be a cinematic masterpiece will certainly want to check this version out sooner or later.  You can always better appreciate the film by seeing the road's not taken, especially since \\"Apocalypse Now Redux\\" proves that all of the cuts improved the film.  But if you have never seen the film, then you owe it to yourself to see the original version and pass on this one.on mots and tucking the captain in for the night.

B00005JKJA|5.0|Truly great film that has apparently inspired some strong reactions. It's a lot simpler than many reviewers make it out to be, but does require you to think it terms of the ambiguity of the subconscious mind. This isn't elitist stuff - nowadays nearly everyone touches on this in High School. Diane is unbalanced and her intense conflicting emotions of desire and jealousy over Camilla have exploded in a deeply meaningful dream/fantasy, her madness culminating in her suicide. An interesting question is whether this fantasy occurs just prior to death, in the time it takes for the bullet to leave the barrel and enter her brain. This merits some attention because, in the dreamwork, Betty and Rita encounter the decomposed corpse of the suicidal Diane Selwyn in the bungalow. So in addition to having to recall your classwork on Freud, Kafka, Camus, Nathaniel West and Philip K Dick, you now have to look up Ambrose Bierce and his \\"Occurrence at the Owl Creek Bridge\\". You have your homework, there will be a quiz in the morning.....
B000092ZYX|2.0|Now, I realize I may not have the popular opinion here, because Radiohead has achieve probably the most rabid and defensive fanbase I've ever laid eyes on, but I feel I can say my piece in that I used to be one of them. I was a huge Radiohead fan when their first few albums came out, and maybe I've just grown out of it, or maybe I just don't get it, but I really don't know what Radiohead are trying to say anymore. <br />I enjoyed Pablo Honey when it first came out. It was a good collection of rock songs. When The Bends came out, I thought I was a fan for life, because that album still remains among my favorite rock albums of all time. To me, it was perfection in music. OK Computer was great as well, but I didn't feel it was quite as solid. Kid A put me off a little, but I still enjoyed it. Around that point, I began to notice that Radiohead was, essentially, alienating all of their rock fans. Then along came Amnesiac, and while I liked a couple songs from it, I just didn't see why they were doing this. They had so much more potential as a great rock band and they became a mediocre experimental electronic band. <br />And while I do think that the venture into the electronic/experimental genre is a bold and brave move for the band, in my mind (the mind of a long time fan, mind you), it's just simply not Radiohead anymore. I am a rock fan, as well as an electronic and experimental music fan, but I just don't see these two styles meshing that well anymore. Don't get me wrong, if this was a great experimental album, I would say so. But there's really nothing to grab onto in this album; no real substance that I can see as profound, just a bunch of blips and bleeps.<br />I will give this album a little credit, however, as it does contain some hints of the old rock style. And *gasp* there are even a few songs where guitars set the melody, such as \\"Go to Sleep\\" and \\"There There\\". But if those songs were an indication of the entire album, I'd enjoy it a lot more. Right now what I'm hearing while listening to Hail to the Thief, is a new Radiohead, and it's a Radiohead that's trying way too hard to be eccentric. There's a fine line between eccentric and pretentious, and I think Radiohead has long since journeyed across that line. Die-hard Radiohead fans will probably enjoy this and talk about how deep and meaningful it is to them, but for this particular fan, I'll just go pop in my copy of The Bends and wallow in some nostalgia for awhile.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Somewhere in the half-way wasteland between the great OK Comp and the somewhat interesting Kid A, this album is NOWHERE.  It really, really is limp-wristed, half-arsed junk.  The critics, of course, love it.  Believe me - don't waste your time or money.  Pass on this.
0792844882|4.0|This is one of those films that probably sold alot of dvd's because people did'nt want to see it in a theatre and one I think people like more than they are willing to admit. I love Showgirls...you have to admit the movie is at the very least visually stunning...and there is of course Elizabeth Berkeley, who is also visually stunning. My main gripe about this dvd is that it should have offered both widescreen and fullscreen versions (as most MGM discs do). While the widescreen version is very useful for many of the dance and stage scenes, it also leaves something out. I have the fullscreen vhs tape, and compared to this widescreen only dvd edition, the bottom 25% of the picture is cut out...I'm not talking about the black bars, but the actual picture...this is a bummer on some of the scenes (particularly for fans of Berkeley's bod)...for example when Elizabeth Berkely walks down the street on the &quot;Ver-says&quot; shopping spree, her legs are cut off... the widescreen shows almost no leg, whereas the full screen vhs goes to about the knee. There are lots of other instances where the full screen is preferable...there are also scenes where the extra wide/side view is better....which is why they should have put both formats on the dvd disc. Widescreen is not always better. If you happen to have the vhs, you'll see what I'm talking about...does'nt seem this fact has been noticed or mentioned. I did a little reading up on the widescreen format, and there are times when indeed the bottom part of picture is missing in the &quot;theatrical&quot; version relatve to &quot;fullscreen&quot; pictures...there are also director's who prefer the &quot;fullscreen&quot; aspect ratio of their movies. Showgirls is a movie which is destined to become, if it has'nt already, a &quot;cult classic&quot;...just wish there were both formats available on dvd.

0385504209|1.0|One of the pleasures of reading fiction is the ability to suspend reality for awhile. Within that context, however, the plot needs to be believable. For example, in science fiction, the author will lay out most of the 'rules of the universe' early on, for example, 'takes place 10 or 100 or 500 years in the future', 'government is now galaxy-wide', etc., etc.  The basic premise in THIS book is that a number of people can keep a deep secret for 2000 years, and that NONE of those folks would be confronted with a motivation to break ranks (successfully, anyway). He also mis-states a fair amount of history: one example, overstating the number of gospels that were floating around before the Council of Nicea.<br />Sadly, I think the real motivation behind this book is simply anti-Christian, and more specifically, Vatican-bashing.  I suppose if it's subtle enough, people will get sucked into it, but frankly, the plot was just too stupid for me.
0767817486|1.0|this movie [stinks] on many fronts.  first, smuggling four pounds of hash is NOT a minor drug offense.  not even statewise!  i love how the xenophobic american movie makers embroiled in their own racism make statements mitigating this dubious drug dealer's activities.  four pounds of hash IS trafficking.  getting four years for that is a light sentence.  so first, let's get that straight, oliver stone.<br />the movie further makes up stuff.  it injects the tale with the typical hollywood emotional extortion material of over dramatizing the basically yawning plot.  stone and parker didn't know -- as is typical -- in hollywood, when to stop and go as far as lying about the 30 yr sentence, the tortures, and the killing of the guard.  none of that is true!<br />and finally, this character brad davis.  he's hopeless.  he's very very difficult to watch.<br />i would have gladly flipped the channel but this was slightly better than the informercials everywhere else on these hopelessly boring american TV feeds.<br />i love the americans reviewing this movie.  that's the most fun about it.  notice, how -- especially this character matt -- americans, whose first language is english, i believe, can't put together a sentence without major grammatical errors and without spelling butchery beyond descriptions.  <br />they don't know how to write but they're experts on international drug laws and turkish prisons.  pleeeeease, you clowns.<br />anyway, the movie bites.  save money and time. watch something else!
B000092ZYX|4.0|I bought HTTT the day it came out, unfortunately not at a midnight sale, but as close as possible (9am).  I've already listened to it, through, at least five times. Something tells me that this album, like Kid A, Amnesiac, and to some extent, Ok Computer.  Unlike most other fans, much of the music was new to me, though I did download a couple of songs from the internet about a week ago...I couldn't wait.  Anyway...<BR>HTTT is a strange album, because, since Kid A, most people have been wanting Radiohead to return to Ok Computer, namely in the idea of more lyrics and more actual band.  Well, this album is significantly a step in that direction. However, after Kid A and Amnesiac, electronic albums that they were (with exceptions, of course), it sounds strangely wierd to actually hear Selway's drums, and Yorke's untouched voice.  In addition, because of the majority of \\"band songs\\", the electronic songs, like Backdrifts, and the Gloaming, seem out of place. <BR>The truly high points of the album are at the end of this album, I think.  Starting with \\"I will\\", a song in the same vein as \\"You and Whose Army?\\", a really haunting piece of music.  Then, \\"A Drunken Punchup at a Wedding\\", a fairly good song, bridges the mood from \\"I Will\\" to \\"Myxomatosis\\". Drunken Punchup is the kind of song that really grows on you, I think.<BR>\\"Myxomatosis\\" is just a great song.  The chorus, of sorts, \\"I...Don't...Know...Why I...feel...so...tongue....tied\\" is just about the best hook this side of the bends.  \\"Myxomatosis\\" leads into \\"Scatterbrain\\", which is just amazing, whether live, unmixed, or on this cd.  PRICELESS.  FANTASTIC.  This is radiohead, right here.  The essence.  And then, Wolf At the Door, a song I tried to download but could never seem to find a working copy of.  I'm falling in love with this song, folks.  Yorke's delivery is fantastic, throughout the album, but especially here, and in \\"Myxomatosis\\".<BR>Other points of interest on the cd are \\"2 + 2 + 5\\", the opening track, which really is a phenomenal song, perhaps the best on the cd.  It's a tie between this and \\"Scatterbrain\\".  And \\"There there\\", the single, has an odd way of attaching itself to you.  Oh, and the other songs are pretty good, too.<BR>This cd will probably take a few more listens to catch hold, partly because I hold it up to OK Computer (the GOLD STANDARD of music), but take notice.  I think this cd, in the first track, has more lyrics than both Kid A and Amnesiac combined.<BR>I recommend this, as anyone who has bought or heard extensively Radiohead albums. If you're a radiohead virgin, start at the beginning, and try and understand the track the band takes.  HTTT is pretty [darn] good, but it [not good] as an introduction to Radiohead...
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead has always been one of those bands that with every album force the listener to reinvent a new way to 'hear' music. Kid A challenged listeners so much in fact a large group of fans were left behind, myself included. Eventualy, Kid A grew to be an obesession just as Ok Computer did before. To write that this new album was anticipated would be a slight understatment. I've been listening to the stripped down versions since they emerged in Febuary and at first i was not impressed. Instant Radiohead classics seemed to follow an even pattern on the CD. The persistant build up of \\"Sit Down, Stand up\\" instantly blew my mind along with the infinatly complex electro-orchestra of \\"Backdrifts\\". The heavy distorted bass of \\"Myxamatosis\\" i thought resembled \\"The Nation Anthem\\" in too many ways, but after MANY listens the songs seem to resemble total opposites altogether. The dark clappery of \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" seemed all to slow and redundant at first...but now i enjoy the anticipation. \\"Where I End and You Begin\\", \\"2+2=5\\" and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" became instant favorites due to the raw emotion and power i remeber from the past. The first single, \\"There, There\\" is an ambiatic/tribal hybrid that slowly works it's way to a rock epic which really suprises me that a song this complicated is getting so much radio and MTV attention. I beleive the next single is \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\" which is a dark angry ballad set to techno blips with an almost jazzy texture. \\"The Gloaming\\" is an all out techno feast which sits light at first just as \\"I will\\" and \\"Scattedbrain\\" did. The real versions of these songs are much easier to digest and now are my latest obsession. All in all, i can say now without a single doubt in my mind that this is the best radiohead album to date. As a whole, the cd is a masterpeice without the usual filler heard on the projects of the past. Every song is so strong and thick with underlying metaphores and subtle blips, it keeps the mind and ears discovering and learning in unison. The dark ambiance is there. The random outbusts of insanity are there. The post-modern ideoligy is there. There, there, with a few more listens, it wont leave your cd players for months. Trust me, You'll have one copy for the car, and one for the home.
B000092ZYX|4.0|This album is by far one of the best releases this year.  The quality of songs and musicianship is amazing, the production is top notch and of course, the melodies are beautiful.  The reason for it only getting 4 stars is: its nothing new.  You will not be shocked or taken off guard by anything on this album.  Before, Radiohead sounded different on every release.  I knew this day would come, but I was hoping they would release one more album before platueing.  <br />Hopefully their next release will blow all of us away - but until then, enjoy this collection of wonderful songs.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Powerful, creepy, and wonderful, this album can to make you feel the music with a well-developed bass and entrancing lyrics.  Their dynamic level goes from a tranquil whisper to an overwhelming explosion, but they find a way to make each song flow to the next and stay within it itself.  It stays modern while keeping a special undefinable quality that only the classics have.  From the powerful &quot;Black Math&quot;, to the bone-chilling &quot;In the Cold, Cold Night&quot;, to the oh-so-sweet &quot;I Want to be the Boy to Warm your Mother's Heart&quot; and &quot;You've Got Her in your Pocket&quot;, and the astoundingly brilliant &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot;, this is the best album of the year, and a worthwhile addition to any music library.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I listen to all kinds of music. In my car's CD case I have Dave Brubeck sittin' right next to Sammy Hagar, Georgia Sattelites, Memphis Slim and John Scofield.<br />So is Norah Jones jazz? Yes. And no. If I had to pigeonhole this album, I'd call it dreamy-pop-jazz-folk.<br />Yes, it's all dreamy and slow, with a minimalist approach to arranging... And so what? It's perfect for a rainy afternoon or a latenight drive on the highway.<br />Her voice is soothing and stylish. Not a real powerhouse singer, but she's got a nice timbre.<br />I read somewhere that she jokingly commented her next album was going to be death metal music. Personally I hope to see some more uptempo stuff on her next disc.<br />Some might argue that this album's monotonous. Others (like me) will say that the songs flow into one another seemlessly.<br />Anyway, I personally am charmed by this CD and I do hope to hear more of her in the future.
B000007T1M|4.0|This is the System of a down cd that started it all. The lyrics go from topics such as life after death, genocide, death of a relative, what drugs can do to you and how media harms peoples minds. Serj's singing was just as good here as in toxicity and steal this album. The rest of the band got a unique sound later on in their career. I'm not bashing the cd at all. In toxicity daron's playing got heavier, darker, and also more diverse, for example the bridges in science, deer dance, needles, and others. It is amazing how te band can go to a heavy riff to multitracked acoustic guitars and mandolin in a minimum amount of time. The whole cd is just incredible and a display of their talent. Like the awesome chorus riff of darts, the solo in peephole (which is almost as good as the one in streamline) and the hilarious verses of sugar. You have to buy this one
B00006J9OT|4.0|Great album and a good representation of a Diana Krall concert. Notice there are more uptempo numbers too.<br />If you buy only two DK albums, make it &quot;Live in Paris&quot; and &quot;All For You (Nat King Cole Tribute)&quot;. And maybe Love Scenes. Not surprisingly they're her &quot;jazziest&quot; albums.<br />&quot;When I look in your eyes&quot; and &quot;Look of love&quot; are both too poppy. And the overdependency on dramatic use of strings makes them sound like muzak.<br />Vocally she's no Ella (who is?), but she does try to maximise the effect of her vocal abilities and I applaud the way she does it.<br />Anyhoo, great set of tunes, good musicians and a vocalist with panache makes for... an album worth having.
B000092ZYX|5.0|This is officially my favorite Radiohead album to date.  It's as deep and moving as OK Computer, with more goose-bump-administering hooks and more psychopathic breaks into frenzied crunch moments.  If you're one of the Radiohead fans that gave up on them when they went &quot;techno&quot;, now's the time to come back.<br />The opening track starts off unassuming, but by the end of the song the guitars are screaming, and Thom's in his falsetto, singing, &quot;all hail to the thief!&quot;  It hasn't been this beautifully heavy since Pablo Honey.<br />Each song drifts seamlessly into the next, making it the perfect album with no songs that need skipping.  They've fully integrated the keys and weird background noises into their sound now, pushing them far beyond the simple grunge band they once were when they were singing, &quot;I'm a creep&quot;<br />The album's on repeat in my stereo, and to quote Thom Yorke: &quot;I'm up in the clouds, and I can't come down.&quot;
B00005QIPH|5.0|Finally there is a band that isn't afraid to sound \\"Dirty\\", The Strokes give you up-front Rock with no gimmicks or studio tricks. They have finally brought back the true meaning of Sex, Drugs & Rock n' Roll. Music sounds so computerized these days with a handful of exceptions. The Strokes bring raw talent in this album and it sounds that there will be a bright future for these guys.
B000083E79|5.0|This is every gay man's soundtrack to life and that's the best review I can give!
B000066F6H|3.0|If this album didn't get so tiresome I would have given it 5 stars but, fact in the matter is that it gets tiresome so that justifies me taking two stars away. They have lots of catchy tracks that just catch you but when you realize that this is the band you keep listening soon the fire will die. Buy this album but don't over do it. Another thing I must mention is that they [are bad] live I mean not good but this review is on the album not their shows.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack is an awsome band that hails from the state of Boston.  This forsome is made up Sully, Tony, Robbie and Shannon. The band's song &quot;Straight Out Of Line&quot; is a hard hitting in your face masterpiece. Faceless is full of heavy riffs that are sure to hold your attention. The tribal beats that were used in this cd was a great way to set up the last song &quot;Serenity&quot;. Serenity is an easy going song that lets your mind rejuvinate.  If you aren't sure if you will like it, listen to the songs &quot;Straight Out Of Line&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot;. I guarantee that you WIll NOT be disappointed. Godsmack's frontman Sully Erna is not just a great vocalist, he truly cares about the band's fans. He goes out of his way to make sure that everyone can afford to buy their cd's and concert tickets. To me, this band knows what is takes to be truly great. Their new cd was well worth the wait and money. So, go out and buy this cd and rest assured that you have made a good decision.
B00006BTCA|5.0|Give this album a few listens then you'll see what I mean. BUY this album. They're even better Live.
B000092ZYX|5.0|The gloaming of the world and all who are in it.  Thoughts of a lurking mankind betrayal on itself.  Pretty enormous subject matter for a \\"progressive rock\\" album.  But wait, nevermind, it's Radiohead.  The scope will be covered with ease and other subject matter to boot.<BR>     With their 6th studio album, Radiohead has managed to raise the bar again.  Thom and the rest of the group are tackling problems that most aren't even aware are in existence, and they're hitting hard.<BR>     So they didn't reinvent their sound this time.  In fact, they didn't change their sound at all.  Instead they blended the old with the more recent, pleasantly balancing all extremes covered in past years.<BR>     But that's not to say that this album is just a hybrid of 1997's breakthrough OK Computer and the ever-so-groundbreaking Kid A.  Hail to the Thief stands on the shoulders of these albums and conceptually pushes forward.  This is mostly courtesy of Yorke's lyrics, which span every end of the spectrum from breathtakingly beautiful to cryptic and horrifying.  \\"Like parting the waves, like a house falling into the sea, I will eat you all alive, and there'll be no more lies.\\"<BR>      If you're a fan of anything from albums past or are just looking for rock music in its highest form, give this one a shot, at the worst you get nicely colored maps filled with intense poetry.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Ok so yeah, Radiohead has been gettin pretty experimental lately.  But that's what makes em Radiohead, they're damn unique.   And I love this album.  I think this is a combination of ALL of their works, manifested into a perfect album.  It's not &quot;too much&quot; of anything.  It's a perfect mixture of electronica, guitar, drums, and vocals.  People say that this album is going to hurt them but I have to disagree.  This album REPRESENTS all that is Radiohead.  I highly recommend it.  Yorke does some cool stuff with his voice I tell ya.  And his messages have a lot more meaning and his lyrics are actually though provoking.  Enjoy!
B000092ZYX|5.0|Not a Radiohead die-hard fan, so please condiser this review objective! I first heard HTTT after the stolen copies were put out some 10 weeks before the official release like many people did. The band said that they were not finished with it. After listening to the official release, they were right. It's worth getting just for the improvement in sound quality and getting the book with lyrics (they can be hard to understand at times). Plus the effects added only bolster why some people call Radiohead the current generation's Pink Floyd. HTTT is a merger of OK COMPUTER and AMNESIA with songs that are angry but catchy, moody but rocking. Definetely one of their most radio friendly albums in years, so those who hated KID A and AMNESIA can breathe easy...(\\"You have not been paying attention!\\"), the governmental authoritative \\"Sit Down, Stand Up\\" (\\"We can wipe you out anytime\\") and the apathy of \\"Backdrifts\\" if the songs weren't so damn captivating. \\"There There\\" shows human frailty but by the end makes you want to get out your air guitar. This has to be considered one of the best albums of 2003. And if you're still listening to the bootleg version, throw it out and get the real thing. You don't know what you're missing. Otherwise, as the band said, you have not been paying attention.
0385504209|5.0|This book kept me up at night, and reaching for it whenever I had a free moment! A fantatstic, wonderful read - Intelligent, and yet still easy to read and understand. The anagrams and various other puzzles contained within this book were entertaining as well as engaging - Overall, a phenomenal read that gets my highest remarks! Definitely a worthwhile investment of time and energy!!!
6305127646|5.0|I thought that this was one of the best romantic/action thrillers in a long time.  Val Kilmer is sexy and mysterious.  If they do make a sequel, they better hurry before he gets old and wrinkled like Sean Connery and Roger Moore.
0800187792|5.0|A 13-year-old girl from New Zealand, Amy (Anna Paquin) ,after the untimely death of her mother, comes to live with her father (Jeff Daniels) in Canada.<br />At first suspicious, angry and uncommunicative, she discovers a new purpose and blooms beautifully, after discovering some goose eggs that hatch into a flock of baby geese.<br />She rears the geese lovingly, and when winter comes , and it is time to fly south , her father comes up with a fantastic plan to guide the birds south to their summer grounds , with the aid of a makeshift airplane/hang-glider.<br />A particularly beautiful scene is when we see the birds landing at their new destination.<br />A wonderful story of the beauty of both animals and people.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Anyone who is familiar with Radiohead's past efforts will certainly not be disappointed by \\"Hail To The Thief\\". One would suspect that, after so many successful albums, they'd be due for the typical popular-music slip-up. Instead, they seem to keep getting better and better, without so much as a chink in their armor of well-produced and intricately composed ventures. Radiohead fans will not only be familiar with the style, but also pleasantly surprised with the new twists and turns. <br />Those who aren't familiar might tend to be a bit shaken up on the first go-round, but repetition should certainly allow it to fall into place...just give it time. <br />Ah, overall...gutwrenching altrockballads; a few great, typical Radiohead hooks (think \\"Bends\\"); the rest is somewhere in between. Bottom line, it's nearly impossible to be disinterested in any of these tracks.
078322608X|5.0|It's just another intelligently written, visually stunning, highly imaginative, well acted, post-bio-holocaust, time travel, tragicomic adventure-romance. Most of your friends won't like it because it isn't a formula they have seen about 10,000 times before. If you never voluntarily read anything and hate interesting science fiction you will absolutely despise this film.
B000088E6D|5.0|I first heard Michael Buble in the film DOWN WITH LOVE. I turned to my friends and asked &quot;Who is that singing? He's great!&quot; But I didn't think about the unknown singer for weeks.<br />Then I was in a CD store with the same friends and one turned to me and said &quot;You must get this CD. This is the guy you liked from DOWN WITH LOVE.&quot; Well, I bought the CD and rushed home to listen to it. <br />This guy has real talent. Harry Connick Jr. may be a fine musician but he is but &quot;a poor man's Sinatra&quot; next to a singer like Michael Buble.  Buble brings something more to the standards. He has a sweeter voice than Connick yet brings a more individual style too. In some ways he is reminiscent of Bobby Darin but whereas Darin could certainly swing, Buble also brings a sensuality to his music. His version of &quot;Sway&quot; is by far the best I have heard and my current favorite from the CD. <br />The arrangements are all great and the selections range from standards like &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; to new classics like &quot;How Can You Mend A Broken Heart&quot; and &quot;Moondance&quot;. Buble's cover of &quot;The Way You Look Tonight&quot; would make even Fred Astaire proud.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead are one of the few bands alive today who have proven themselves to be true musical artists in every sense of the word, and their brilliant new album &quot;Hail To The Thief&quot; more than cements that fact.  Here are moments of stark beauty, dark despair, all driven by the bands' masterful insturmentation and Thom Yorke's emotionally powerful voice.  I am so glad to see this wonderful band evolve to where they are today, recieving the acclaim and praise they so richly deserve.  Real stand out tracks for me are &quot;Sail To The Moon&quot;, the semi-folksy &quot;Go To Sleep&quot;, the crunchy in-your-face &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;, &quot;Sit down. Stand up&quot;, the dreamy &quot;A Wolf at the Door&quot;...the whole album is fantastic from start to finish, and you'll want to hit &quot;repeat&quot; once it has played through the first time in its entirety..it's THAT excellent!!  Radiohead's newest masterpiece is NOT to be missed and is a definite addition to my list of best cds of 2003...with this stunning new collection of songs, Thom and the boys have nowhere left to go but up~and towards an ever brighter future.
B00008LDPU|2.0|Let me start of by saying I really enjoyed the matrix.  The matrix reloaded was okay, but nothing special.  I was looking forward to the animatrix because I incorrectly thought it would be written with a similar quality and caliber as the first matrix.  I was wrong.  I won't rehash what many other reviewers have already stated, but for those who are still deciding whether or not to buy, DON'T.  You will be disappointed.  The quality of the animation presented is sub par only to its dialogue and plot. Many of the stories are pointless and obvious.  I fear the kid's story will start a new trend of teenagers jumping from the roofs of buildings so they can wake up in the \\"real\\" world.  I am honestly not sure [who] thought that story up.  With the exception of the last flight of osiris this was a poorly thought out poorly executed production.  I advise that you rent before buying.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Once again Radiohead comes back to save popular music from the banal drivel.   &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is without question thier best effort to date.    It is experimental while still maintaining accessibility, few artist can pull that trick off.  One of the best tracks is the funky &quot; Myxamatosis&quot;, it's pulsing synth is completely infectious.  It is hard to pick other standout tracks, the entire work is so strong.  This CD has a cohesion about it that flows gracefully from one song to the next.  It is nearly impossible to listen to one track without listening to the whole thing.   <br />Hats off to Radiohead for making the most interesting CDs of the year.  Ahead of the curve, WAY ahead.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|this movie is one of the most incredible films i've ever seen. It was completely shocking to me. The story is absolutely crazy and the end really tripped me out. Though terrifying and morbid, it is an amazing movie and will make you think.
B00005JM1F|1.0|I cant believe people are comparing this movie to Animal House. Animal House is a comedy classic. This movie is a joke. Its a typical comedy of today.....Stupid! They dont know how to make movies anymore, its pretty sad. I dont even know why I rent movies today. I guess I like \\"old school\\" movies.
B00005JKPF|5.0|Surpassing it's rival, the over-hyped MATRIX RELOADED in terms of action, story, spectacle and SFX, X-MEN 2 is one of the (Very) rare sequels that actually manages to turn out better than the original. Pitting the good and bad X-Men against a military scientist William Stryker (Brian Cox), the story is more involved than X-1 and has better action and some good humour thrown in for good measure. And fans are kept happy with some great mutants from the comics. Building on his fantastic persona, Hugh Jackman does a terrific job as Wolverine, who finds out more about his mysterious past. And he kicks some serious butt in this movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magneto are great, and new mutants Pyro, Iceman, Nightcrawler and Lady Deathstrike. My favourite character, Magneto is even better and Mystique provides both eye-candy and action-woman role. John Ottman's comic book-esche score gives the films a whole new layer of mystery and excitement, and Brian Singer's steady hand makes this one that is not to be missed on the big screen. Building on itself to the amazing finale, the only problem with X2 is that once it's over, you want to see it again. An incredible action event and one of the best movies of the year so far. 5-Star entertainment.
B000092ZYY|5.0|Anyone who was maybe less than thrilled with Radiohead's more outright cerebral outings in Kid A &amp; Amnesiac will be pleased to know that their latest 'Hail to the Thief' is full of energy, spunk, and Thom Yorke's trademark lyrical barbs. Yorke lays out a full plate of jabs at the power hungry who seem to be taking over, it's a call to arms to stand up because &quot;you haven't been paying attention&quot; he tells us in the rocking opening &quot;2+2=5&quot;. Yorke's vocals are brought to the fore-front and he's never sounded so fleshed out, confident, melodic, and intense. The record definitely has the feel of a band working together, proof that the test these songs got at live shows last year worked.<br />The balance between old and new is met nearly perfectly with the electronics being used as more of a compliment to song buidling, instead of the main course as was the case at times in the 2 previous efforts. The first single &quot;There There&quot; is the prime example, featuring 3 band members playing percussion with a nice arrangement, but with some anthemic guitar work kicking up in the middle. &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; fits that mold as well with it's groundwork of acoustic guitars building up to a more sonic blast climax. &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; is &quot;Pyramid Song&quot; reborn, while something like &quot;A Punch Up at the Wedding&quot; is almost an r&amp;b groove, something new, as is the big fuzz bass of &quot;Myxomatosis&quot;.<br />Radiohead fans will rejoice at this effort, both new and old, no matter if they want 'The Bends' part 2 or not. This is probably the true stepping stone between the past and future, only a couple years late. Wether it can turn someone onto Radiohead that hasn't connected with them in the past is hard to tell, but it's certainly something worth their time to invest in to see.
0140067477|4.0|This book explains Taoism and how it translates into &quot;the way&quot;. It talks about how pooh doesn't conplain constantly like eore and calculate, he just is. He sees a situation as it is, and explains that that is the tao of pooh. He later talks about Lao Tzu-the founder of Taoism.<BR>     It is a very imformative book on a very well known character and how he relates to a fairly uncommon religion
B000092ZYX|4.0|New disc from Radiohead has a sound and feel similar to the band's awesome OK Computer LP. After my disappointment at the pointless electronic doodling of Kid A, I was thrilled to hear the band getting back to a more structured, less experimental approach. There's still plenty of strange electronic sounds drifting around in the mix and no shortage of the keyboard-oriented techno style that dominated Kid A but I welcome the return of vocal melodies and guitar this time around. After the first listen, The Gloaming stood out as my favorite but all the songs are good. New Radiohead music...life is good.
B000077VR3|3.0|I liked it but then I didnt like it. I think the problem is that I saw Chicago before I saw this &amp; it blew me away! I expected more from Moulin Rouge then it was. I still thought it ws good. It made me laugh &amp; it made me cry. I love that one guy i forget his name but he has like a speech problem! He is so cool! Anyways Chicago is a much better musical than this, and if you want to see a classic musical see Chicago not Moulin Rouge
B00008PBZW|5.0|\\"Windtalkers\\" is another great WWII epic that depicts a little known and seldom-told story of the war: the Navajo Code Talkers. The film did not deserve the bashing it received by critics. One of the reasons it was bashed was because the film was a bit uneven in the editing. It jumped too much in some areas. But that has been cleared up thanks to John Woo's impressive \\"Director's Edition\\" of the film. The 134 Minute film has been extended to 153 Minutes, and is much more exciting and balanced in editing and emotion. This just proves that war films work better at a running time in excession of 150 Minutes! As for the DVD, it is incredible. Disc two features a documentary on the real Navajo Code Talkers as well as a Tribute that will have anyone tearing up. As for the rest, pure entertainment (Warning: the Special Features are almost 100% identical to the ones found on the \\"Pearl Harbor\\" Vista Series Director's Cut DVD, but this does not take away anything at all)! A must-own DVD!!!!<br />Movie Grade: A+<br />DVD Grade: A+
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is one of the best albums I have heard in some time.<BR>New and unique sound. Every song is one to enjoy.
B000066F6H|5.0|I bought this Cd when it was first realeased and I listen to it non-stop for about a week. I haven't slowed down since. Once you put it in your Cd and hear the opening chord, sure it's great. But what follows is a relentless attack of chords, vocals, and, my personal favorite part about the Hives, bass lines. After this perfectly timed Cd you realize something. You haven't heard music this good in years. Then you listen to it again, again, and again. Thanks guys. You rock!
B000003TAR|5.0|Now on to the music......Nirvana follow up their landmark album \\"Nevermind\\" with a much more darker, and introspective album. \\"Nevermind\\" was a album that catered to the angst of a lost generation. \\"In Utero\\" is a album that challenges that same fanbase with new ideas. This album is by far Nirvana's best studio album. The album kicks off with the rockin' \\"Serve the Servants\\" which in my opinion is Nirvana's best song. A song about Cobain's reluctance to be labeled the spokesperson of Gen X. He also references in the song his longing for a real father. This album doesnt really hit a bad-note. It's a guitar driven, distortion lovin', feedback makin', rocker all the way. Cobain's influences go as far back as Jimi Hendrix which is evident with all the distortion and feedback in this album, Jimi Hendrix created that style of playing. Another incredible song on the album is \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" which is so genuinely raw it'll leave you wondering what you just heard. Other noteable songs are \\"Rape Me\\" and \\"All Apologies\\". <br />This album is a must-have for any hard rock fan looking to get lost in musical Nirvana.
B000092ZYX|4.0|As Radiohead's return to recording after almost 2 years, Hail To The Thief (HTTT) is an amazing work. After first hearing almost three months ago, when an unmastered copy leaked to the internet, I must say I was blown away. A few reasons why:<br />2+2=5. Wow, Guitars - rockin' ones. Something lacking in the past two albums.<br />We Suck Young Blood. Haunting. Looming. Beautiful. Hand claps.<br />There There. Great solo.<br />I Will. Perfection.<br />A Wolf At The Door. Quickly becoming one of my favorite songs.<br />The only thing that really irks me about this album is The Gloaming. That song, for some reason, cannot click with me. But other than that, this is a solid album and I reccomend buying it.<br />So do it.<br />Right now.<br />No, now. <br />C'mon! :]
B000092ZYX|5.0|It's safe to say that Kid A is the dividing line in Radiohead's catalog, separating those who were fans of The Bends poppier, hook-laden guitar rock from those who welcomed the more experimental electronic leanings of the aforementioned. (Thankfully, I love both periods). Regardless of whether you're from the pre or post Kid A camp, any new Radiohead release is looked upon with high anticipation. Thankfully, with the release of their latest, Hail to the Thief, there's a little bit of something for everyone.<br />The album plays like a conglomeration of Radiohead's career to date, mixing in a perfect balance of material featuring crunchy guitar rock in their OK Computer vein along with their electronic post-Kid A dabblings. Yet, while the songs may appear to tread on familiar (or at least now familiar) ground, this album is far from a holding pattern or artistic \\"coasting\\". merge their multiple-personalities and signature sounds into a tight little cohesive statement that still manages to tread into unchartered territory for the band and expand their sonic pallette further. Take tracks such as \\"Myxomatosis\\" and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\", which are definitely different than anything they've done before. Lyrically, Radiohead isn't afraid to address current issues either, which is refreshing in a world currently overrun by corporate greed, big brother police state tactics, media manipulation and falsification of truth, and general overt political correctness. Radiohead wants to remind everyone that we all (at least in the western world) are supposed to have freedom of speech and have a right to speak our minds. And while others have clearly buckled and kept their mouths shut after catching heat for making unpopular remarks, Radiohead clearly don't give a $#!t what anyone thinks. Not everyone took those idiot pills after the bombing of Iraq. (Read what you will into this comment...I don't care).  <br />Hail to the Thief shows the band continuing their logical ascent towards maturity and growth, and further solidifies Radiohead's importance and vitality in an otherwise drab and uninteresting period of current music. If anyone can save popular music, it's Radiohead.
B000002KHF|5.0|Sublime. Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness. So pure. So clean. Unprocessed like a hay field should be. Just enjoy it.
B00005QATY|3.0|The three star rating for this movie is a relative rating.  By most standards, this is a pretty decent movie; by Coen movie standards, comparing it to &quot;Blood Simple&quot; and &quot;Fargo,&quot; it doesn't quite come up to snuff.<br />Very very very loosely based on Homer's &quot;Odyssey&quot; (the Coens admit that they have never read Homer), this movie feels more like a series of vignettes, only marginally connected to each other, loosely strung together.  Some of the scenes, such as the revival down at the river, really don't seem to make much sense and do little to advance the storyline.  Compared to some of the excellently constructed scripts of the other Coen movies, this plotline meanders considerably.  As the movie approaches its conclusion, the plot becomes increasingly contrived in an effort to tie all the loose ends together.<br />That being said, this is nonetheless an extremely enjoyable movie with some great lines (I don't want Fop, goddammit, I'm a Dapper Dan Man!) and engaging characters.  Also, the soundtrack is simply top-notch.  At times, I suspected that the Coens fell in love with bluegrass and crafted this movie just as an excuse to put together a good movie soundtrack.<br />This was a fun movie to watch --- I guess I have just been spoiled by the very high quality of the other Coen films.
B0000028M7|5.0|Ive been listening to this album since the day it was released. Every song on the album is perfect.<BR>This album defines the words &quot;Hard Rock&quot;.<BR>Newer bands need to take lessions from them (except godsmack who totally ripped their sound and even name off AIC)
B000002J09|1.0|...This CD is completely amazing.  Any one who criticizes this album is not a fan of Rock.  Personaly, I have spent most of my adult life researching pretty much every Rock band that has made any success at all.(It is my job)  I have come to a conclusion that Led Zeppelin is most impressing band there is.  To many, Jimmy page is the best guitarist ever.  That can be debated. The same issue can be considered about John Bonham.  Robert Plant has an extremely attractive voice.  He has very impressive variety, and sounds excellent.  Jihn Paul Jones allows Led Zeppelin to be such an amazing band and still have only 4 members. I think that it is a complete miracle of life that these 4 people of different talent found each other.  This album is a result insane talent.  There is no better explanation. I also suggest buying the new DvD and CD. It will take breath from you.
B00005YUNY|2.0|If you compare their song with Lezeplin, the Who, rolling stone,<BR>slade, Sweet etc.... Their way far out behind... all i remember<BR>their notes is close encounter third kind \\"not a actual root of<BR>rock and roll beat.... except...\\"Owner of the lonely heart!!\\"<BR>their get it right!!!.
B00007EBAG|5.0|This is one of the few CDs I can listen to all the way through and not wish I'd skipped some tracks.<BR>It's true it doesn't sound just like Vibrator and Symphony<BR>or Damn - but it sounds great.
B0000931OL|4.0|I enjoyed the album as a whole. However, the packaging says the album has 4 extra tracks on the limited edition, yet I haven't been able to access any of these. No one else has commented on this, and I am a bit confused why.
B000001GQB|5.0|I was a bit reluctant to buy this cd because of some of the complaints regarding both the tempo and &quot;stiffness&quot; of some of the symphonies. But I'm now grateful that I was persuaded by the other 90% 5* reviews! Mozart in my opinion was a master at both tempo and volume, not in an absolute sense, but rather a relative one. In other words the tempo and volume of one part relative to that of another in the same piece or movement. And Bohm brings this out quite well. It this variation of intent, mood, tempo, etc. that make Mozart's symphonies timeless works of art. I see his symphonies as a metaphor for life itself.<br />Finally, although I'm content with this recording's version of the &quot;Jupiter Symphony&quot;, I find the version recorded by Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony (RCA 6376) as quite stunning despite having been recorded almost half a century ago.
B000092ZYX|2.0|I've never been a huge Radiohead fan, but I know great music when I hear it.  And this band has made some great music over the past 10 years.  But this album is pretty much garbage... even if it's admittedly some of the most interesting music that will reach a wide audience this year.  The fact is that \\"Hail to the Thief\\" reeks of pretension, cliche, and worst of all: MEDIOCRITY.  The album title is obvious, the cover art is aesthetically hideous and politically redundant, and the song-titles (all 28 of them) are... well... they're just unnecessary.  But let's get to the music!  Here's my track-by-track analysis:<br />\\"2 + 2 = 5\\":  No it doesn't!  Nor does \\"ANOTHER arpeggiated guitar riff intertwined with a treated rimshot beat\\" + \\"a vocal mannerism completely ripped off from David Thomas (Pere Ubu)\\" = \\"an effective album opener\\".  <BR>\\"Sit down. Stand up.\\": Write better lyrics.  Or shut up.  This track has some interesting things going on instrumentally, but how many times have I heard those drum samples?!?  Also, those laser guns sounded pretty stupid 25 years ago when Joy Division used them on \\"Insight\\" - chances are they ain't gonna sound much better now.<BR>\\"Sail to the Moon.\\": This track is pretty good, but it's entirely interchangeable with at least 5 or 6 other Radiohead songs. <BR>\\"Backdrifts.\\": Once again, I've heard all of these drum samples a million times.  There are definitely some interesting melodic sounds though... and some effective vocal doubling.  I guess this one's a keeper. <BR>\\"Go to Sleep.\\": This just sounds like a bad rip-off of the Red Hot Chili Peppers' \\"Breaking the Girl\\" to me for some reason.  That was a great song.  This is not.  <BR>\\"Where I End and You Begin.\\": This track is AWFUL!  It sounds like a throwaway track from Can's \\"Tago Mago\\" with embarassing 'eerie' keyboards.  Let's be innovative and adventurous by throwing an odnes-martenot on top of a boring drum and bass combo.  \\"I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive\\" - the goreimagery is just stale at this point.  Case in point:<BR>\\"We Suck Young Blood.\\": I wish I was listening to Nick Cave instead of this, even though his last album was pretty much garbage also.  But \\"No More Shall We Part\\" is probably the best pop/rock album of the past 5 years - so buy that instead of this.  This song should just be called \\"We Suck.\\"<BR>\\"The Gloaming.\\": Looks like somebody discovered Max/MSP.  This would be much better without the vocals (as is the case with most Radiohead).  Pretty good minimalist electronic - the sounds should be much more varied, though.  Check out Autechre's \\"Draft 7.30\\" if you're into this - Radiohead wish they had an ounce of these guys' imagination and technique, and it's probably the best album of the past 7 or 8 years.      <BR>\\"There there.\\": The drums (and video) are a direct rip-off of Bjork's (pronounced Bajork) \\"Human Behaviour\\"... but I'll admit this is a really great song.   The vocals are less mannered and the lyrics are more understated than the rest of the album.  It's about time they have some hooks on this thing!  Interesting guitar sounds.  <BR>\\"I will.\\": Again, interchangeable with at least 5 or 6 other Radiohead songs.<BR>\\"A Punchup at a Wedding.\\": This drum intro is embarassing.  And then you have to go and steal the riff from Beck's \\"Loser\\"!  A terrible example of layering electronic sounds (that don't blend at all) on top of a dull backing-track in a sorry attempt to make it \\"complex\\" and \\"heady\\".  <BR>\\"Myxomatosis.\\": I'm not sure what to say about this.  That Moog sound is pretty Eno-riffic but I think it would have been better saved til the climax of the song.  It becomes too grating and repetitive after a while.  I like the other synth sounds, but again the lyrics have to go.<BR>\\"Scatterbrain.\\": \\"Hey Johnny, it's almost the end of the album and we only have one song with an arpeggiated guitar riff intertwined with a rim-shot/hi-hat beat!  Whip us up another one!\\" \\"No problem, Thommy!  Just don't forget touse your same cloying vocal mannerisms!\\"    <BR>\\"A Wolf at the Door.\\": A nice change of pace in the vocal delivery.  Thom should quit Radiohead and do a solo rap project a la Zack de la Rocha.  That's the best idea I've ever had.  Crap, now he's singing again... at least he's avoided the falsetto for a good three minutes.  Whoomp, there it is!<BR>OK, album over, hopefully I'll never have to listen to this all the way through again.             <br />Epilogue: I've decided that the biggest problem with this band is that there's no sense of JOY in their music.  Yeah we get it, the world's a terrible place... Bowie was a paranoid android 25 years ago, but he also had a sense of the good life.  So, in conclusion, buy Can's \\"Tago Mago\\", Eno's \\"Another Green World\\", Bowie's \\"Scary Monsters\\", Nick Cave's \\"No More Shall We Part\\", and Autechre's \\"Draft 7.30\\" and you'll hear complete mastery of everything Radiohead tries to accomplish on this album but simply cannot.
B00006CXXU|4.0|i'm not exaclty a christina aguilera fan cos i think that her attitude is really bad and she needs a slap but this album is crazy. her voice is really powerful i would reccomend this to anyone even if it is just to slag it off but you have to hear it. with a few let downs in the album it is over all fantastic. i hate to say it but...go her.
B00009EIQE|5.0|This is best blues album Buddy has put out in years.In fact it's the best one anybody has released in years.<BR>The song selection is great and Buddy plays acoustic guitar the way it's meant to be played.Remarkable vocals,he's never sounded better.<BR>In this year of the blues Buddy pays great tribute.
B000092ZYY|4.0|...and it could be 5/5 stars by the fourth or fifth listen.  It seems like Radiohead are trying to get back to the days of OK Computer and The Bends, but they have been so warped from the creation of Kid A and Amnesiac, that they had a bit of trouble trying to get back.  I must say that when I first heard 'There There' (the first single), I nearly jumped for joy as I heard guitars instead of keyboards.  Now don't get me wrong -- I have grown to love Kid A and Amnesiac like all of their previous albums, but they were so entrenched in keyboards that I forgot (at times) that Radiohead is still a guitar band at heart.  I won't run down the tracks and analyze each one, but I would definitely say that this is an album worth purchasing.  It will be very interesting to see where Radiohead goes from here.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Hail to the Thief is stunning.  Radiohead knows how to please listeners every time.  This album isn't like Kid A or Amnesiac, which most fans have had a hard time adapting to.  It incorporates elements from both Ok Computer, and Kid A/Amnesiac into it.  &quot;Sail to the Moon&quot; has the space vibe to it just like Subterranean Homesick Alien off of Ok Computer, good song to listen to at night.  &quot;Go to Sleep&quot; has a notorious acoustic riff that can be related to their Bends period.  &quot;A Punchup at a wedding&quot; gives you a church feel, with all the voices in perfect harmonization.  &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; reminds me most of &quot;The Tourist&quot; off of Ok Computer, the voice emitted from Thom Yorke is truly beautiful.  It's so great to hear him singing again; after not hearing his voice in full rotation on Kid A and Amnesiac.  The thing about Radiohead is that you can't judge them by what they have done previously.  Those 5 men keep the true spirit of innovative and talented music alive, while commercial music comes and go.  Brilliant, Innovative, RADIOHEAD.
B00008WT5J|5.0|You can look at AC/DC's Who Made Who in 2 ways: You can view it as a greatest hits collection, and as a movie soundtrack. I Look at is as both, although its not really considered a greatest hits collection, but it has all the good tunes to accomplish that level. No matter what this is, its still a great album. It has classics such as You Shook Me All Night Long, Hells Bells, For Those About To Rock, and Who Made Who itself. It even spawned a video collection, which went gold. The best song on here is the Title Track, which is live staple. All songs sound good, but even better digitally remastered.
0060925000|5.0|Just finished my second reading of \\"A Suitable Boy\\", it will always be one of my favorite books.  Looking over some of the other reviews here I see that this 1474 page novel has been called \\"just\\" an Indian soap opera, and while I think soap-opera may be an apt description, it is one of the best books I have ever read.  This novel reminded me of an old fashioned English novel in the style of Dickens or Trollope or Eliot, with a large cast of characters, a thick tome with many divergent plot lines that are eventually tied together by the ending, an incredible journey for a reader.  They just don't write them this way any more.<br />The title story of  the novel is the one of Lata Mehra and her search (or rather her mother's search) for a suitable boy to marry.  The novel opens at the wedding of Savita & Pran and introduces many of the characters we will be seeing more of later.  Lata is struck by the fact that her sister is marrying a total stranger, accepting passively a marriage arranged by the family,  later she will choose between passion and an arranged marriage for herself.  Maan Kapoor is another central character that we get to know in depth following him through his obsession for Saeeda Bai, exile from the city and the dramatic scene involving Firoz.  There's far more though than the stories of only Lata and Maan, both of whom are sometimes almost forgotten for several chapters,  so many other unforgettable characters amongst  the Mehra family,  Kapoors, Chatterjis, Rasheed & his family, the Nawab Sahib & his family, Saeeda Bai's establishment.  I found Arun & his wife Meenakshi, the anglophile snobs absolutely hilarious.<br />Besides being \\"just a soap opera\\" revolving around the lives of half a dozen families of Bramphur, this is an ultimate book about India following the years after the death of Gandhi and independence from  the British.  Partition and ever increasing tension between Hindus and Muslims are ongoing themes  and the continuing more subtle influences of the British on Indian culture.  Every walk of life is covered from the untouchables of the Rudhia district to the Raja of Marh and his son.   <br />Don't let the size of this book discourage you, I found it easy to read over a period of time;  each of the 19 sections is like a mini story in itself, with many short chapters in each section.  I took several breaks in reading this, always drawn back the way one is drawn back to a family and old friends to see what's become of them now.  Long as it is, I wished it could go on forever.
