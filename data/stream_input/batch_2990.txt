B00AW57L96|4.0|A easy read on a rainy day. Interesting twists and turns with nothing too r-rated. Satisfying end to it. Overall enjoyable.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Enjoyed reliving this series in one continuation, no commercials. Most importantly on my time schedule.  Only gave four because it was an older series.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I like this app because it does have all the radio stations that I like to listen to in Lincoln, NE. I also like exploring all of the other radio stations as well (such as the radio station in Antarctica!). My only complaint is with the home screen widget. In landscape mode it works just fine, but in portrait it just says &quot;problem loading widget.&quot; I'm running a rooted original kindle fire android 2.3  with go launcher and the kindle stock launcher (I switch back and forth). I've also dual booted the device with android 4.2.x so will check to see if the widget works properly with the higher android version instead. Fix the widget for 2.3 and I will upgrade to a 5-star rating. If you don't use any custom launchers (i.e., you only use the basic kindle software, which is the majority of users) you can't go wrong this app if you enjoy listening to live radio. Just be aware that it doesn't close in the background if you use the home button. This is so you can listen while doing other things such as reading an e-book. The station should show up in your status/notices bar so you can get back to the app easily and pause or close the app from the menu inside the tune in radio app. It's just a pet peeve I have: there's nothing I hate more than when an app gets bad reviews from people that obviously don't know how to run their device.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read Ender's Game more than once, but not in more than 10 years. It's aging, but well. It's definitely a favorite of mine and I wanted to reread it before the movie is released.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I like BBC news on LPB and find it more informative on US matters and less political than US tv news.  Having a Peace Corp grandson volunteering in Jordan gives me a better outlook of middle eastern governments in that region.

B003QS9WIE|4.0|This is one of those movies that you really need to watch more than once to appreciate the subtle characters points and plot twists.  The performances and direction are top notch.  Very enjoyable for 13 and up.
B00BC5I6Q2|2.0|I give it two stars because of the acting.<br /><br />But let's talk about the storyline:  This is the only series I have ever watched that with each succeeding episode the writing (script) got worse.  I would give the first episode a \\"9\\" and the last episode of the season a minus \\"2\\" because it was so stupid.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />In the last episode, Kevin Spacey murders a fellow congressman.  They are in the congressman's car, in the garage, engine running.  The congressman is drunk, and passes out in the passenger seat.  He is a major liability for Spacey, so Spacey shuts the garage door.  The exhaust fills the garage.  He has made it look like suicide (or accidental death).  Washington D.C. Police find his body the next morning. HOLD IT RIGHT THERE.  This death scene would have been investigated by the FBI -- because he was a member of congress!  This is not a local police crime scene -- it is Federal, and there is no way that Kevin Spacey is going to elude the best forensics in the world.<br /><br />Besides, was that the only option Spacey had - murder?  NO!  This is just terrible writing.  The writers are trying to be edgy, instead of clever.<br /><br />Consider The Boss: Those writers deliberately paint Kelsey Grammar into a corner in each episode, causing you to wonder how in the world he is going to get out of this mess.  And the writers cleverly save him!  Each episode gets better because of the writers.<br /><br />House of Cards needs new writers.  The original writers gave it their all in the first episode.  Then ran out of gas very quickly.

B008G3N71W|5.0|W.H Auden once wrote, \\"Every man carries with him through life a mirror, as unique and impossible to get rid of as his shadow.\\"  A mirror has power over people because the reflections we see in the mirror are often not the objective reality.<br /><br />For Greta May, the protagonist of this novel, a mirror is a symbol of who she imagines herself to be.  At the beginning of the novel, she wants to be an actress but fails at it and has to work in a shoe store. She isn't confident in herself, she's yearning for approval, and is not sure where to find it. Her perception of her own image reflected in the mirror is a warped one, and the mirror does no favors for her self-esteem.<br /><br />The mirror is a symbol that is used throughout the whole book; it appears in the book 27 times, and each time Greta's perception changes ever so slightly. At the end of the book, she is confident and she accomplished her goals, if not in the way she had hoped for. And since she dreamed of being an actress, it seems fitting to quote Drew Barrymore, also an actress, who said, \\"I used to look in the mirror and feel shame, I look in the mirror now, and I absolutely love myself.\\" And that's how Greta, no doubt, feels by the end of the book.<br /><br />Greta aspires to be an actress, and the novel contains many references to various roles Greta either had or wanted to have. The beginning of the story, after she meets a mysterious stranger on the subway, reminded me of the 1980's film \\"9 and a ½ Weeks\\"  but this novel takes on a very different direction. Instead of being emotionally destroyed by kinky sexual experiences, like the heroine of the film, Greta manages to take control of the circumstances where no control seems possible.<br /><br />Unlike Kim Bassinger's character in the film, Greta is not intimidated and doesn't end her sexual adventures by leaving and crying. On the contrary, she gains confidence and control over her life. Her sexual journey is not of the vanilla variety, and most people would not even want to fantasize about the experiences Greta willingly participates in - but that's what makes reading about them fun.  Read this book if you dare but keep in mind that, as Chloe Thurlow writes, \\"Once you give in to your instincts, give in completely, there is no way back, no way of knowing where it might lead you.\\"st people would not even want to fantasize about the experiences Greta willingly participates in - but that's what makes reading about them fun.  Read this book if you dare but keep in mind that, as Chloe Thurlow writes, \\"Once you give in to your instincts, give in completely, there is no way back, no way of knowing where it might lead you.\\"

B001XVD2Z0|4.0|The movie was good and a fun review of philosophy.<br /><br />I could not watch the regular version so I had to rent the HD version and the total was double plus the extra HD charge:( no way to get my first charge back because you have to watch it within 24 hr but it would not play. Just spring for the HD and enjoy.

1611136954|5.0|If you like legal strategy, and want a suspenseful book to listen to while you walk, clean, commute, do errands etc., I looked forward each day to my daily 60-90 minute walk so I could listen to this Mickey Haller legal mystery. It may be my favorite novel with Mickey Haller. Loved the courtroom strategy and the unpredictable curves in the plot.<br /><br />The defendant is a character you love to dislike, but she seems likable compared to some of the other unsavory characters in the book: the murder victim, unscrupulous financial firm CEO's, the opposing attorney and more.  Mickey brilliantly conceives a strategy that is innovative involving a fifth witness.  Fabulous.<br /><br />Loved listening to this story from a CD, as it seemed like Mickey was talking to you, and you were sitting in on the meetings with the judge, the client, Mickey's staff and in the courtroom itself listening to the testimony.  I could walk 90 minutes and it seems like 20 minutes, which is always a bonus when you are exercising.  I just wish I had another Mickey Haller ready for the CD for my walk tomorrow.  Looking forward to the new release this December of the latest Mickey Haller adventure.  All of Michael Connelly's mystery novels are good; this one I thought was particularly excellent and one of my favorites Connelly has written.  I thought it equaled THE LINCOLN LAWYER in quality.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I am very happy with Chromecast.  It took awhile to get it and I didn't get the three free months of Netflix, but I got over that.  We're enjoying Youtube videos on our TV and casting movies from other websites.  Some people have complained that the video and audio are not synchronized, but I haven't had any problems with that.<br /><br />I'm seriously considering terminating my satellite TV subscription since between Chromecast and Roku, I have more content than I could probably watch in a lifetime and, of course, both keep getting new content.  I'm also tired of paying through the nose for over 200 channels of satellite TV when I only watch about 15 channels regularly.  I've heard that apps for Chromecast are in the pipeline and I'm really looking forward to them becoming available.  It's a great deal at just $35.  I highly recommend Chromecast.

B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I was introduced to the rock music at the age of probably 12 or so by my elder brother. Many groups had come into my life like the Grandfunk, Bad Company, Deep Purple... etc. etc.<br /><br />For the Deep Purple, &#34;Smoke On The Water&#34; goes deep into my memory and easy to sing along. Likewise the GrandFunk's &#34;Inside Looking Our&#34;, &#34;Locomotion&#34; and the Bad Company's &#34;Bad Company&#34;, &#34;Rock Staady&#34;, &#34;Ready For Love&#34; etc. etc..<br /><br />But it's this band Eagle that I can remember most if not all songs. They're without doubt one of the most talented musicians get together and sing straight from their heart passionately, always.<br /><br />All are original band members except Steuart Smith sit in for Don Felder and all are so harmonise and synchronise that they deliver nothing but the true music to all.<br /><br />To them is Farewell Eagle, to me is Forever Eagle.

B001BPQT8A|5.0|I always have this thought that human is quite a conflicting, complicated creature on earth. Is it true? I'm not too sure as well. But people eat sharks fin and yet they say sharks are dangerous; they eat snakes and yet they say snakes are venomous.. etc.. Then there's a classic saying:- Money is the root of all evil.<br /><br />Now this show really sums up all the characteristics of human beings and presented them in a trilled but yet down to earth manner via the Seven deadly sins - gluttony, envy, lust, pride, sloth, greed, and wrath.<br /><br />The young and energetic detective David Mills (Brad Pitt) take pride of his work but still end up as a loser to the serial killer who killed his wife -- He can't control his feelings of hatred and anger (wrath) and shot dead the killer. The show is intense and I hardly move my sitting position.<br /><br />A true reflection that we may have committed one of the sin daily without knowing it. An excellent show that I highly recommend to be in your collection/library.

B004SEUJ82|2.0|This review will contain potential spoilers throughout. That's fair warning for anyone who hasn't seen it because this movie is impossible to discuss without referring to the events.<br /><br />It is my opinion that Viktor Frankl would be displeased. An eminent psychologist who survived three concentration camps, he hypothesized the \\"meaning-drive\\" and an existential approach to therapy that would deal with it. He wrote frequently about the human need and capacity to create meaning in any situation, no matter how horrid. Of course he wrote extensively on Holocaust experiences to defend his views.<br /><br />From that standpoint, I think this movie is a complete failure. What are we ultimately to learn? Frankl himself believed the task of great fiction was to help us interpret the meanings of the unique conditions of each individual. So let us take each individual in the movie.<br /><br />We have \\"Kurt,\\" the soldier who's sent to the front lines for not reporting his father, yet he learns nothing in the movie. He's horrid straight up until his disappearance, lest we're to interpret his tousling of Bruno's hair as a transformation. There's Bruno's sister who falls victim to propaganda and has nothing more than minor emotional reactions to any event of the film aside from the ending.<br /><br />There are Bruno's parents. The father who acts as if he's been completely brainwashed. He has one line about \\"sometimes you have to do things you don't want to,\\" and there's no evidence he's referring to the atrocities he's committing. Other than that, he's emotionless throughout. We see him as a true fundamentalist authoritarian without a thought in his head or a conscience anywhere in sight. His final look of the film is simply one of surprise, and I'm still not sure he learned anything. The mother is utterly useless. She's caught between not seeming disloyal so that her horror show of a husband won't report her to the authorities, and the eventual revelations she suffers which cause her to snipe at him from across the table. There's no growth here either.<br /><br />This brings us to the heart of the film: Bruno and Schmuel. They're both innocent. Neither of them ever learns anything about their situation. Bruno at best questions the wisdom of his tutor or the ethics of his father once or twice, but neither of those are pursued as even side-stories. Then they both die.<br /><br />Ultimately this brings us to the question of what have we gained from this experience? None of the characters have gained anything. If they ever do, it occurs after the movie which doesn't count in terms of the story. Write about the change of the character(s) is storytelling 101. As a viewer, it could be a revenge plot. Does the father deserve the suffering inflicted upon him, and does Bruno deserve to die to enact it? That's awfully fatalistic and cynical though, and Frankl's point was that we can find meaning in any individual experience no matter how horrible. Friendship prevails to the end? Children are naive? There is simply no depth to be applied here.<br /><br />We don't need to know that the Holocaust was horrible. Anyone who needs to be informed of that won't learn it from this movie. So at the end of the day the film is emotional, jarring, shocking, and any number of the numerous adjectives used to describe it, but it fails as the meaningful interpretation of an individual life. In that sense it lets down both the viewer, and someone who I think is one of the greatest minds to survive the Holocaust.

B007SZ0E1K|5.0|My main reason for upgrading was to increase my FPS on Tera (online MMO, which uses a lot of CPU processing). My cpu was bottlenecking and decided to try out the i5.<br />From an old AMD PhenomII x6 1075T (OCed to 3.5 GHz). This upgrade was like adding rocket boosters to pc... WOoosh...<br /><br />In battlegrounds, with low settings I usually got around 5-15 FPS.<br />Nexus... bleh... with low settings I used to get about 1-5 FPS.<br />With the i5, battlegrounds gets a 25-40 FPS with max graphics on.<br />and in Nexus a decent 20-32 FPS with max graphics on.<br /><br />(Running on a AMD HD 7870 2GB (DDR5) at 1920x1080 res, with 8GB DDR3 1333MHz ram)<br /><br />Installation was simple, although I really hate installing an intel heat sink... (took me a while to figure out the trick on installing and un-installing it.<br />I would recommend you getting an after market Heat sink for your CPU. even if you are not OCing... not that the CPU gets hot, but still, a cooler cpu gets better performance than a warmer one.<br /><br />Was it worth the purchase? Yes.<br />Another recommendation! If you dont plan to Over clock, then go for the i5-3570 (not the i5-3570K). Notice the K at the end. The one without the K is a few dollars cheaper but the cores are not unlocked.

B005LAIIGW|5.0|Director Alfonso Cuaron (Children of Men, Harry Potter and the Prisoner Of Azkaban) took and amazingly simple premise of a fictional STS (Space Transport System) mission using the now retired Space Shuttle fleet and bringing the `reality' of walking in space to complete and full visceral life on the big screen. \\"Gravity\\" is one of those films where you'll leave the theatre feeling like you had just experienced an amazing adventure yourself.<br /><br />Written by Cuaron and his son Jonas Cuaron (Year of the Nail), this is a fresh original story that will move you with every frame of film. This is one of those rare films where the experience is only enhanced if you see it both in 3D and in IMAX. It was a thrilling adventure. It was breathtaking. It was scary. It was awe-inspiring and it was a roller-coaster of action and event after event.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock (The Proposal, The Blind Side) plays Mission Specialist and medical engineer Ryan Stone who definitively gives an Academy Award deserving performance throughout this production. She plays a nervous, somewhat excited and an extremely professional scientist sent up in orbit to enhance the Hubble telescope.<br /><br />The Mission Commander, Matt Kowalsky, who is on his last mission before retiring to Earth, is wonderfully played by George Clooney (Batman & Robin, The Descendants). He is light hearted, professional and focused but knows how to make his team feel good about their work and being in space.<br /><br />Things go terrible wrong as a Russian Anti-Satellite test goes wrong and they have to destroy it in space. Shooting and destroying it with missiles from Earth. The debris from the explosion (which we never actually see the explosion) is blasted into orbit traveling in thousands of pieces at the speed of a bullet.  (Which is approximately 900 to over 1000 miles per hour.) At those speeds, with no atmosphere, no resistance and no sound, within half-a-second they rip through, the shuttle, the probes, the satellites are literally pelted to pieces and yes, even some of the crew.<br /><br />Because this happens in space, it's Clooneys, character that figures out that they stay in orbit around Earth at that speed and appear every 90 minutes or so and again rip through anything in their path until their individual orbits decay. The film is basically about survival in what is literally the loneliest place you could ever be. Space. No sound. The finale is amazing and the depths that Bullock's character goes through and the performance she gives will leave you inspired.<br /><br />With just the two of the most incredible actors Hollywood has to offer(Bullock and Clooney), along with director Cuaron, they take you a thrilling (and peaceful) journey through space, space stations and even satellites that orbit above us as you read this even now. With beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men, Sleepy Hollow) and incredibly accurate production design by Andy Nicholson (The Mummy, Alice In Wonderland) \\"Gravity\\" is a full blown `real' movie experience.<br /><br />The panoramas of the Earth and space are amazing. The stars shimmering against Earth are beautiful and quiet and incredibly detailed. (Especially in the IMAX and 3D format.) The music by Steven Price (The World's End) is just as inspiring as the images you see. This is one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long while and it feels so visceral and life-like that you actually feel good leaving the theatre. Take the whole family to see this one \\"Gravity\\" is aptly name, once you see it, you'll know why!satellites are literally pelted to pieces and yes, even some of the crew.<br /><br />Because this happens in space, it's Clooneys, character that figures out that they stay in orbit around Earth at that speed and appear every 90 minutes or so and again rip through anything in their path until their individual orbits decay.

With beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men, Sleepy Hollow) and incredibly accurate production design by Andy Nicholson (The Mummy, Alice In Wonderland) \\"Gravity\\" is a full blown `real' movie experience.<br /><br />The panoramas of the Earth and space are amazing. The stars shimmering against Earth are beautiful and quiet and incredibly detailed. (Especially in the IMAX and 3D format.) The music by Steven Price (The World's End) is just as inspiring as the images you see. This is one of the best Science Fiction films I've seen in a long while and it feels so visceral and life-like that you actually feel good leaving the theatre. Take the whole family to see this one \\"Gravity\\" is aptly name, once you see it, you'll know why!
B00F91SCXC|3.0|I liked the story and it was definitely creepy. Suspenseful and weird. The only thing, for me, that didn't nail it was the pacing toward the last 1/3 of the movie. I was also ready for something else to happen but it didn't. Still worth the time to watch it.
1587143879|5.0|I received the package in excellent conditions. 2 books, dvds.<br />Very useful I almost finished the first book. At the end of the month I am going to pass the exam.<br /><br />Cheers
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Loved it! Great follow up to the 2009 Star Trek. Hope they make another one. Picture and sound quality is great.
055380684X|5.0|Great knowledge for any parent, coach, teacher, inidivudal.  In-depth discussion on his research and findings and yet easy to apply. I would recommend also reading &#34;The Little Book of Talent- 52 Tips to Improving Your Skills&#34; by the same author.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Even if you don't like zombie movies, you can still watch this and pretend that it is about a virus that goes haywire.  There are some mild profanities (Hollywood just cannot make a movie without using such words), but none of the very offensive ones (I am not sure of the \\"UNRATED\\" version), although, if you watch it very, very, very closely, Brad Pitt almost uses the F words.  I could tell that some editing was done, but most won't notice unless you replay one scene several times [I will keep it a secret].<br /><br />Brad Pitt actually is watchable [I am a male, so his 'machismo' is a bit too much in some movies] and comes across as a tender father even better than Tom Cruise [an egomaniac in many of his movies] did in War of the Worlds.<br /><br />Even the ending gives one a sort of feeling of relief.<br /><br />I give it a 9.7 out of 10.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is funny and amusing. I am terrible at games, but I feel even the avid gamer will feel challenged enough in this game. Love it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I use this wile I'm reading and sleeping its got a sleep timer .I love all the sounds!!!!! Im very happy with this app.
B00B1D7ANK|5.0|I realize the title of this review isn't terrible creative, but there's no need for fancy descriptions when you have such a great toy.  The level of detail is amazing and the quality is beyond compare.  My twin four year old boys have played with almost nothing else (except perhaps as opponents for the fearsome dragon and noble knight) since we got it, and even their ten year old brother will try to get in on the act.  My only (small) complaint would be that the wings pop out a little easier than I would like; while this isn't an issue now, I'm afraid the sockets will wear out over time and exacerbate the problem, but time will tell.<br /><br />Simply put a beautiful, fun toy that should lead to hours of imaginative play.
B0048NXG4W|5.0|I saw this movie when I was 11 when I thought I was so in love with a pretty girl in our neighborhood. This movie elaborates that innocent feeling of love from your childhood days. The music score by the Bee Gees was a perfect fit. Melody, to me, is the best movie about childhood crushes and innocent love...puppy love!<br />Mark Lester and Tracy Hyde were perfect for their roles.
B000Q6GUW0|4.0|I have collected several shows and though I have a few others I like better, this show is well worth checking out.<br />Although it may not be for all people, I enjoy it a lot. If you don't mind getting into the head of a serial killer I suggest you give it a watch.<br />I will be ordering the rest of the series soon.
B00BWJ91XK|5.0|Did a great job again- great story, great acting, great visuals- make sure to buy it and not rent it- you'll want to watch again and again.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I totally enjoyed this book.  It also gave me insight to life as a severely handicapped individual and I don't look at even a handicap parking space the same way.<br />Want to get lost in a book?  Then this is for you.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I love this show. I would and have recommended this to all my friends. I own all 10 seasons and will continue to purchase them as long as the show runs.<br />The mixture of serious crime drama and comedy is just perfect.
B0037WP83M|5.0|I've always loved the film. I had somehow misplaced my DVD and discovered I could buy it on Amazon for my kindle. You can't believe how happy I was. Now I can watch it wherever I have WiFi!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I recommend that everyone make purchases with this supplier , it is very good and fulfilled with the product and delivery.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Typical jack reacher but still good.  Innocently kidnapped with an female FBI agent ... Too bad for the bad guys.
B00E89VXQY|5.0|I'm going to open by saying the idea of the movie seems absolutely less than important.<br /><br />What is important and the reason I bought this album, is the audio is absolutely delicious. I don't know what James ate those nights, but his voice has never sounded better in the past ~15 years. This performance sounds like the '89 seattle shows crossed between the cunning stunts era. The band has a great presence, the engineers did a great job of capturing that 'live' sound. Cyanide, which I was not a fan of from the album, takes on a whole new life here. I don't know if its the upped tempo or the tightness of playing it for years now, but way better performance than the album. The classics are tight and lively as well. Orion I could do without, something about Cliff's work that just can't be recaptured.<br /><br />ten bucks for a live record that actually seems to capture that live essence? absolutely.
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|I recommend that everyone make purchases with this supplier , it is very good and fulfilled with the product and delivery.

B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book.  This was very suspenseful and the ending was not what I expected.  I would highly recommend this book to others.  I did not want to put it down.

B00AWJYJVA|5.0|Le Carre has a way with words that keep you glued to the page. This is one of his best books and with the recent whistle blower scandals one which is  amazingly current. A most enjoyable read I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good yarn.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I read the prequel and loved it so this one was just as fun and engaging! Read something borrowed first and then go to this one. You won't regret it.

B008RA3X5E|4.0|it works very well and it's always on time<br />I really like the weather feature. its very informative and easy to use
B0036TGT2A|3.0|Purchased this in part for the 3D version but the other main reason I bought it was because I thought it included the soundtrack. It says &#34;+ Music&#34; which I found out was just 7 songs from the movie and 3 renditions not in the movie. I had a difficult time trying to get my digital copy via iTunes so I could at least get those 7 songs on my iPod and it did not work out. The instructions were not very clear on whether or not the music came with the digital copy of the movie or if they were 2 separate downloads. I tried to email the address they gave for digital copy help and my email was returned to me saying the recipient did not exist! As of now I have no digital copy of the movie and no songs :(  Not too pleased with the purchase.
B000MDJH9A|1.0|Order came quickly but DVD doesn't work..  This is my second order OF THE SAME dvd from different company and the DVD's are not reading on any of my DVD'S(3).  Other movies are working perfectly fine.  Disappointed!!
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|The album is a mixed bag for me. A dramatic turn of events was amazing, so i guess my anticipation was too high.  I like Labrie and Rudess' new solo albums a lot better than this. None of the songs are 'bad' they just arent that memorable.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The character development is just like a novel of that period, rich and complex. Notice how Edith has developed from the little snit she was in the first season. Look at the dimension we are now seeing in Maggie Smith's character--and of course, her performance is flawless!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Mr. Gaiman continues to provide excellent, thoughtful literature.  Per usual he has masterfully mixed sweetness, darkness, and mysteriousness to provide a quick and fulfilling read.

B003JTHXN6|5.0|I'm not a &#34;big&#34; reader, when I do I tend to read books on coding. I started reading this book on a vacation and couldn't put it down. I read this book non stop.
B00EIMJVOM|4.0|I bought this CD as an import because it wasn't made available in the United States. I listened to this CD all the way through with no skips, and it was all right. The album wasn't as good as Jessie's first record. It really felt to me that there was too many ballads on this album. They seemed to weigh the album down. There's not a lot of upbeat songs, but all in all, this was a good album. The first track, \\"It's My Party,\\" is a great track! It get's a little annoying sometimes, but i like it. The next, \\"Thunder,\\" is a very powerful song, it's one of my favorites! :) After track three, \\"Square One,\\" the album goes into a slower mood, with the little exception of, \\"Sexy Lady,\\" a midtempo track. The album kind of drags on until track eight, when you get to, \\"Daydreamin'.\\" This is a 1980's grooving flashback song! The mood and melody of it is great! (Another one of my favorite songs). We then are to track nine, \\"Excuse My Rude,\\" featuring Becky G. This was also one of my favorite songs! It just has so much energy and wit behind the lyrics. You have to listen to the silence in this song to understand what i mean. Track ten, \\"Wild,\\" is a great song, but i prefer the song without Big Sean or Dizzee Rascal. They really get annoying after a while. Tracks eleven through 13 dragged on, they were ballads as well. I thought track twelve, \\"Conquer the World,\\" featuring R&B Queen Brandy would be more upbeat, but rather, it has a more acoustic, stripped down feel to it. It's a nice track to just sit down and relax to. I bought the deluxe edition, so we are up to tracks 14-16. These tracks are midtempo - uptempo songs. I like them, and i prefer them over the ballads. Track 14, \\"Unite,\\" is a great song. Powerful lyrics, good beat, and good vocals. The next, Hero, (which was featured in Kick A** 2), is another great song. It is similar to, \\"Unite.\\" The next to last, \\"Magnetic,\\" is a very powerful, yet dark and great song altogether. (It was also featured in a movie, \\"Mortal Instruments: City Of Bones). The last track, a remix of, \\"It's My Party,\\" is a good remix. All in all, i give Jessie J's new album a B-. It is a great record, but i really thought that the ballads on here outweighed the uptempo songs. I would recommend getting the Deluxe Edition, as it has tracks 14 - 17 on it, listed as bonus tracks! Great record, but not as good as, \\"Who You Are.\\" Recommended.ts: City Of Bones). The last track, a remix of, \\"It's My Party,\\" is a good remix. All in all, i give Jessie J's new album a B-. It is a great record, but i really thought that the ballads on here outweighed the uptempo songs. I would recommend getting the Deluxe Edition, as it has tracks 14 - 17 on it, listed as bonus tracks!

B003K16P3M|4.0|I am an adult but really like reading the young adult titles with string female characters. These were lacking when I grew up, I hope they are helping to empower young women to know how strong they are and that they can stand on their own two feet.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is a good story, well-written. SPOILER: it's a sad tale, especially if you are a parent, but I enjoyed reading it. Great character development. I'd certainly recommend it.

B00992CF6W|1.0|I hate this game I had 22 dimond and 53 gold but my kindle shut down and daltted my world
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a well written story that kept me laughing and made me cry a bit too.  It is worth your time to read.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Do you love a story that takes you in and gently wraps around you, becoming a part of your every breath? This is an enchanting tale told in a voice that is masterful in storytelling. Please write more. Ms. Morgenstern is a true craftsman much in the same sense as the great Harper Lee. I insist you make time for this gem!
B0040I09RM|5.0|Great to start of the series. You'll want to watch it non-stop! Twists and surprises until the end. View it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love love love this game. This is a great game for people of all ages--criticial thinking skills are required!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I like the game and it is fun but, the load time is not good and there are constant pauses in the game.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|I haven't finished reading the entire book.  It really isn't a book that you expect to read through like a novel.  From the sections I have read and the anecdotes told by the author, I have already learned more than I anticipated about how to pick up on other people's non-verbal cues.  I have also used some of the advice to control my own body language, positive and negative.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|constant action. surround sound was awesome. nice reversal of roles between spock and kirk in the end compared to tv program years ago. khan takes on more sinister persona and solution was classic. spock new and old was nice twist. exciting movie with great video and audio effects.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is just a simple game that doesn't hold your interest for very long.  My kids occasionally play it but even they tire of it and move on to the next must play app.  It's pretty hard to give any app that is free a bad review or rating.
B007N579X6|5.0|Got this one after seeing the sequel in the theater.  Maybe not quite as good as the sequel, but still well worth having as a complement to the other.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Excellent short novel, you'll probably read it in one sitting and want more. I know I did. Sanderson has outdone himself with this story, and I'd read more novels in this setting in a heartbeat.
B004JMZPJG|5.0|Really sturdy camera case, we are using this case for our Canon EOS 70D DSLR camera and it fits perfect. We also put the battery pack inside and it fits well too. There are two zipper pockets on each side with room for cables and instruction manual. Zippers are sturdy and the fabric is nice and protective.
B000UJ48SQ|4.0|Must get the Blu-Ray version to really and fully appreciate the portraits in motion picture cinematography. This is truly a masterpiece.
B005DOKL3E|5.0|Protects and make it easy to keep up with.  Zipper is smooth and conforms to my Kindle Fire.  Nice pretty color.
0802473156|5.0|I'm convinced that Dr. Chapman was inspired by heaven in his work and in writing this book. Understanding the concept of love languages, and our individual love languages specifically, has made our pretty good marriage really great! I have been recommending it to everyone I know!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Absolutely amazing. I would highly recommend this book. A friend told me to buy it & just read it. She wouldn't tell me what it was about & strongly urged me not to read about it or any reviews. So I did just that. I turned to the first page and began reading. In the beginning I was slightly confused but as the story continued I understood where I was & what it was about. Beautifully written. A very important story for today's society. I urge you to pick it up and begin the adventure on a...more
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|This book is so-so reading. The plot started out interesting enough and then took a boring turn. Also the author goes on a bit too long describing irrelevant scenery. For free, it's good enough to spend a rainy day with.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is a really good time waster, for procrastinators like me. It does take a while to get investment points without going bankrupt.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|I ordered this for my soon to be 4 year old and he loves it!  Octonauts are his newest obsession.  Just be careful that the plastic opening windshield comes off frequently and is the hardest of all the &#34;gups&#34; to put back!
B00EY8B8JG|5.0|This show has everything I'm looking for in weekly entertainment. A bit of drama, action, mystery and definitely humor. I'm looking forward to getting to know each of the characters piece by piece as episodes unfold.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I've been hoping that King.com would make it possible to play their facebook games on Kindle.  This game is great, I've been playing it on my pc for a long time.  Thanks, and now--please--let us have Candy Crush Saga!!!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I loved the voices and the story. The girls were darling and the movie has a good ending. Nothing negative for a change!
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I absolutely love this show. I couldn't wait until the third season was released on DVD.  I started watching it as soon as it arrived.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I loved this movie so much I read the book by Michael Orr<br />I have never watched a movie where I cried so much.<br />LOVED IT and would recommend it to everyone.<br />Great, uplifting story
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Enjoyed. Does not come up to the level of his more recent trilogy but would recommend it to a friend.

B004LOMB2Q|4.0|With its ability to easily capture from web pages and hold all formats, Evernote is the best app of its kind.  I only wish they would allow you to upgrade your monthly upload allowance for a flat fee rather than a subscription price.  I end up using it in conjunction with Dropbox because of this.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|Really good acting. Vanity and pride played out well. Story line keeps you interested from start to finish, but would have liked to seen the ending pulled out just a little to see reactions of family members. Won't say more it would spoil it.

B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Have watched from the beginning and unfortunately have watched the story go down hill.  That the story is set in a transitional period for the UK is true but the spectical being made of good people living this change in their society is not well done and unfair.
B00003CXI1|5.0|DVD has been delivered and is in great condition.  Thank you very much.  I have been wanting the widescreen edition of this for 10 years.
0399534601|5.0|Very cute ideas in this book. As an artist I usually get something out of it whenever I randomly open it. Also, I leave it out and about so that people can play with it when they come over. Everyone likes it :)
B000A6T1JU|1.0|100% agree with the disappointment of other fan's of this Directors/Butchers/Narcissist Cut.  As one reviewer put it : The Directors cut is a HORRIBLE abomination to the film. I hate the fact a whole new generation of people will watch this disgraced version for the first time. The powerful segue-ways during the Baseball Furies chase / the dusk to dawn sequence from the train to the Wonder Wheel towards the end and that final amazing scene during the credits...are RUINED by the juvenile comic book stills. These unnecessary interruptions take away the tension, suspense and just ruin the cohesiveness and momentum of the movie in a very significant and desecrating way. Walter Hill the great director should have fired Walter Hill the worst editor ever. The extras that include interviews with the cast are certainly worth seeing, but if you have not seen this classic before, PLEASE watch the bare bones first edition DVD that does not have the ubercolor cover but the more black/blue/whitish cover with a large picture of Swan's (Michael Beck)face in the upper right...or search your movie section of cable and find it on Encore or IFC. Walter Hill...Shame on You! Do NOT watch The Directors Cut version if you have never seen this movie. Watch the original, then check out the extras on this disc if you feel the need.<br /><br />The Original version cover looks like This:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000541AM Warriors Michael Beck]]
0761169253|1.0|This book just flat out sucks. I don't get it, I don't get the hype about this guy at ALL. Great idea with the blacking out type and whatnot - but a whole book about it?<br />What a waste of money.<br />So anyone want to trade me for mine? Give me a book you hate I'll give you one I hate :D
B00D7NOOJ0|3.0|Great idea, but the story really fell short of what it was capable of.  I'd recommend the watch if your mind is a little numb and you just want to put something on that doesn't require much thinking.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app is great.  The large interface makes this an app that's easily readable.  It provides the key basic functions of a calculator that gives you the quick answers you are searching for.  Highly recommend that you download this one!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|It was funny and entertaining... the perfect movie to stream for free with Amazon Prime on a lazy Friday night!
B0029LHW4U|5.0|If you like Alice in Chains, this is the best in my opinion, hands down.  Every song on the album is good.  It's one that the band put their heart and sole into.  You can't buy an album with every song being good anymore.  This is one of the final exceptions to the rule.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Great effects and fun for all. A for sure classic for generations to come.  Of course the original has surpassed the test of time.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is Soundgardens' first album that really got some air time and was owned by everyone I have ever associated with back during that time.  It doesn't sound like old stuff.  It's still really good.  No filler on this album.  Every song is great.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King proves once again who the master is. I always thought follow up books never beat the first, until now. In my youth, \\"The Shining\\" was the scariest book I've read. But I enjoyed the excitement of Danny and \\"'redrum\\". I couldn't wait for this book to be released. As soon as I read what it was about I knew I would be hooked. Never a disappointment from the first page to the last. KEEP ON WRITING MR KING
B000RLH2VM|3.0|This was a good action movie with a lot of car chases and exciting twists. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action and adventure movies.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED this series. and the third and final did not disappoint. Ended with a decent closure and the writing stayed true to the author. I already miss Ana and Christian. laters babies.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|All around great action drama. Great character actingcts and CG effects.  My son loves the Avenger Characters. You need to watch the individual Character movies too. Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America,Thor.
B005SGMR8Y|3.0|The streaming of this show is terrible, not to mention extremely irritating. And this is the standard view, don't even waste your money on the HD.  It usually starts right up, but a few minutes in, it starts to buffer or cache or whatever the heck it's doing.  Then when it finally restarts it does so from a point a few minutes back in the show and I have to fast forward to where I was when the problem started. Then wait again while the yellow circle goes round and round. I have no complaints about the show itself, at least in it's first season, but something has to be done about the streaming issues. Its a total PITA.  Unfortunately, I purchased the entire season so I am now stuck, pun not at all intended, trying to get through the episodes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fluid animations, and detailed card design. Love the different deck back choices too. Very easy to get lost in the game and lose track of time, but well worth it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I play it all the time and love it! Plus, it doesn't require wifi, so it is a great time waster!
B001TMFFSA|5.0|I bought this for my son as a book that he needed to read for school, it arrived on time, and it was in great shape.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is very fun to play! You can play it anywhere you go. Well if you have Wi-Fi. I have Wi-Fi. It's so funny when the person runs into  the or a train. MUST GET!!!!
B003U9TDII|4.0|Good soundtrack. I loved the movie and knew the soundtrack had to be good.  The are a few filler songs where it's just background music but there are some good ones on the disc.  A good buy nonetheless.
B0030BCCB6|4.0|I was surprised by how much I enjoyed these records.  All three albums are really good classic blues records from a great band--prior to several radical transformations.
B00AF82WTO|5.0|I have the prior version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, and i find this comparable.<br />I have watched this many times (lost count).  Great Jane Austen novel and great actors.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. I was a ardent fan of the original TV series and stars. This movie felt warm and comfortable.
B0093QHWLC|5.0|I loved it! Tragic how his wife did not believe in him more. He had already gone through so much.
0062225790|5.0|I am a big fan of Richard Dawkins and I like the way he writes, so I expected this book to be good--I was not disappointed!<br /><br />I admire Dawkins work in Botany, Philosophy, and Ethics. This book is done from a very personal viewpoint and it helped me understand his background and how he developed as a young man.  Interesting family pictures and many personal details.
0321934318|4.0|Doesn't explain everything, but as usual with his books, the writing is clear, and it covers probably 90% of everything you'd want to do. I use it almost exclusively although I have more advanced manuals.
B007SGLZH6|5.0|In 2001 I was given Ed Wood's Sourdough book and a package of his fine San Francisco culture.  I read the book and baked from it.  Since then I have had read and baked from 6 or 7 more.  I have achieved some degree of success from those books.  But I have never achieved the level of success as I have with this book.  Folkish book is an easy read and straight forward.  Unlike many other books out there, He lays out the concepts of the why's and how's and then follow with exercise recipes to demonstrate the concept.  On my very first try, I had baked the best bread that I have ever baked in my entire 12 years of endeavor!  Just want that good bread and have no good bakery nearby, want to bake something that you can claim your own? Simply buy this book and follow Ken Forkish's advice.  An absolute must have book for bread lovers!
B002361MLA|5.0|So...first heard of Tolle in a Falmouth Jamaica. Came back got the book then also read A New Earth. I like this one better as it seems more on point IOW NOW. It helps keep me focused on my own minds wandering and has quieted the incessent dialogue.<br />I got it from the Kindle Lending Library but after another few monthes kept wanting to go back to it so purchased and glad I did.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great show, JM  and Chris Noth are awesome. Great acting, great storyline... I am hooked, yes I am very hooked
B000SEI230|5.0|I really loved the book. I couldn't put it down. It made me cry most of the time. It's definitely one of the best book of Nicholas Sparks.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Modernized version, but well written and well acted. Lots of sex though, definitely not for kids to watch! Once you start watching, you get hooked and wanting to keep watching and wanting more. Really good show, just keep in mind, it's entertainment.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Google needs to find away to allow the Chromecast past hotel &#34;login&#34; splashscreens. I'm surprised google overlooked this.<br /><br />Without that, I can't take it on the road with me, so it's just a novelty item for home or office use.
B005544TRQ|5.0|TV has always had a place for the genius character, but this is much more an ensemble show. Great cast all around; not a weak performance in sight.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|got the movie for my kids since I grew up with this timeless classic and it looks wonderful in HD the Blu-ray looks great and it looks very nice in 3D as well this is a perfect movie for all ages to view and fits right up there with other classics, this is spoiler free but the audio transfer on Blu-ray was wonderful and fully surrounds you almost like your there under the sea. also if you make this purchase for the 3D edition you get the standards that the other versions come with (2D Blu-ray and dvd) also you get for FREE a digital copy which as of this writing costs $20 here on amazon also you get a digital music download which honestly wasn't that great since I still have the original CD release from way back when. all in all another great classic from Disney and as far as I know there should be only 3 diamond editions left with spring being jungle book and all that's left should be Aladdin and 101 dalmations.
B00AHG9KYE|4.0|This is a well told story that is very believable in terms of todays technology. The main character stands out as do his relationships to the others. This has inspired me to read the preceding books in this series and I am enjoying them as well. Taking this one out of order did not detract from it at all.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Good season but killed off way to many main characters and left the season on an extremely depressing note, hard too want to watch season 4 when it comes out.
B008DBF5Z8|5.0|Quality product which is easy to use.  Clear picture on the screen helps give better graphics to the audience.  Worth the price.
B00CRS88IO|2.0|Not wringing with facts to hold to time period just a odd set of characters.Not worth the time even as a quick airline read. Just so many better books to use you time with in reading.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|What happens relly when you become half an inch tall!  Great excitement, sad tragedies but quite clearly a page turner in true Crichton fashion.  Don't plan to sleep if you start to read this!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My cousin and I can play this app all day. We never get tired of it because it never gets old!! Its super fun I reccomend it!!
B0007ZD6YK|1.0|This was extremely dissapointing because the disc is european and I can't play it.<br />My schedule is busy and taking the time to try and return items is very frustrating.<br />I will not buy from this Seattle based shop again.<br />I still want to see this show!
B007T99ENE|4.0|Good read and plenty of variety. Could not put it down at the end and glad it ended happily ever after!!! Typical McEwan stuff - he knows how to get the message across. It always amazes me how men can write so much about women - they seem to know more about us than we know about ourselves!
B0001IMCDE|1.0|It's a europian DVD and I can't play it.<br />I will be returning it for replacement or credit as I still want it.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|Nice bluray set, for a great show. Honestly I can't stand Sookie, but the rest of the cast is awesome.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's facebook. Nothing more to really say about it. It's been the same since it was created - could use some updates similart to what Apple provides for their users.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a very basic set of Mahjong games, but it is a lot of fun to play once in a while.  For free, I recommend this game for anyone beginning to play Mahjong.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A decent thriller movie. Many thanks to the makers who spared us the gratuitous gore that I was bracing myself for and expecting to have to turn off. There are lots of plot holes, improbable situations, etc., but for some tense chases, things that go bump in the night and wanton destruction, it was a pretty fun ride.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|This is the only way to go.  If you have an old style power supply cable and a new laptop, the inexpensive tip is perfect.  The magnetic connection is solid and I never worry about it getting lost with normal activities.  It works perfectly and I highly recommend it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Action packed<br />A Percy Jackson afterwards<br />A cliff hanger so great that you want to strangle uncle Rick! (Rick Riordan)
B005HSG3U6|5.0|This case has kept my kindle fire well protected, and it looks as though it will last longer than the kindle.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Excellent so well researched, thoughtful, historical, respectful, well written, I loved it. Look forward to reading more of this author. Understanding the historical/cultural periods of our major religions is fascinating.
B002RKSCA6|4.0|I had not read this before and got it since it is a classic.  Not a bad addition to my library.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Very compelling true life adventure told with humility and humor.  Bravo, Cheryl, for your courage and stamina and for sharing it with us.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I recently finished rereading it.  I had as much trouble putting it down as I did when I first read it!  I've read the whole trilogy twice and expect I'll go back to it many more times.  I'm glad it's a Kindle version -- not going to wear out the spine!
B003CHGV74|5.0|Very good show. Characters are so well developed and you can't help wondering what will happen next!  Can't wait to see the next season!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'd read a hard copy of The Hunger Games loaned to me by my son.  After racing through that and coming to the end (What!  NO! Don't stop here!) I raced to get the sequels (and later the first) for my Kindle.  This is the third course of a great banquet, the final act of a gripping play -- either way, NOT to be missed.  This version makes it so easy to keep with you.  Thanks to whoever translated this to a Kindle version!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyed the previous 2 books (Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns) much more than this one, but none-the-less i was a good read.  It felt somewhat disjointed - there were perhaps too many different characters involved that were really on the sidelines and simply did not have enough to do with the main characters.  Felt that more should have been made of Pari's 'lost' brother, Abdulla and the ending was rather flat, or rushed, perhaps.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After having read the copy of the book my son had lent me I rushed to get the whole trilogy for my Kindle.  I started  reading quite reluctantly and soon found myself on this roller coaster racing to the end!  I have read the whole trilogy twice and I expect  I'll come back to it, much like having a favorite meal again.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|The special effects are extraordinary.  The plot regarding a crew on a mission that determines the fate of everyone on Earth, certainly is interesting.<br /><br />The flaws are as follows:  At the beginning of the movie, there is no sense of urgency.  Most of the characters have emotional issues so obvious, they'd never pass the psych evaluation to get on the mission.  The final scenes were made too surreal and the flesh being pulled off an arm was gratuitous gore that served no purpose.<br /><br />But, even with all that, I have the urge to watch this movie again.
B00122MBY8|5.0|I think this is the greatest album of the \\"rock\\" album era.<br /><br />It's one of those discs that seems to exist out of time or space. I've never really been able to come up with a tidy way to describe the music on this album...Celtic folk/soul/jazz? I don't know, but Van's lyric about \\"gardens all wet with rain\\" describes the vibe perfectly. It's mood music for late nights of the soul, I suppose. Or maybe late afternoons of the soul. Whatever it is, it's perfect. Uplifting without being upbeat, and always moving. Timeless.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I have really enjoyed this series so far!  This book did not disappoint!  I think that the writing is well done, and that the characters are being very well developed.
B001LR73QA|5.0|Discovered this album back in 1997 on a rainy night in a Borders music section. Whatever was playing over the speakers sounded like Nick Drake crossed with late-sixties Kinks (two of my favorite obsessions), and I finally asked the guy behind the desk what I was listening to. I was the only person in there, and he eagerly shoved a copy of the (then new) disc into my hands.<br /><br />The band has grown stronger and more diverse over the years (even as they've lost two founding members), but this disc (technically their second, but the first to receive widespread release) remains one of a handful of essential listens for me. As summer comes to a close, it's re-entered heavy rotation again, over fifteen years later. Stuart Murdoch's hushed, poetic vocals, and the band's intricately beautiful arrangements never sound dated. And it's an album that works best as a whole, taken in one unhurried listen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is very addictive and you will never want to stop playing it!!! It is definetley worth every penny  in the $6.99, there are so many different things you can make. If you buy this app, you will never regret it, TRUST ME. Mojang is a genius for creating this app. If you are creative and love art, do not waste any time. Scroll up, hit purchase, install , then tap on open. YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT, TRUST ME!!! ;) :)
B0048KXRR6|5.0|This is one our family's favorite movies!  We also love the first Nanny McPhee. Fun for the whole family!  Good, clean entertainment.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|All i can say is \\"i'm hooked\\"!! Add me!! My farm id Dshdzvc I love playing it. It just makes you think of nothing else but your cute little farm. Total distressor at the end of a long day.
B000KJZWMW|4.0|The film is clearly low budget, but it is entertaining.  The helicopter pilot's character is brilliant.  It is worth watching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The hunger games series are spectacular! Brilliant! Epic! AWESOME! One of the best series ever. And the second book is so cool! I can't wait to read the next one!!!!!! :)<br /><br />Suzanne Collins your so awesome!!!!!
B000IZXR7U|4.0|If this movie had a large budget, it would have been a huge hit.  The plot is good, and there is a lot of suspense in it.  The cars are cool, and not the type you find in the US.  I watched it with my girlfriend, and she was really caught up in the suspense.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|It's amazing to read on such a complex universe told in such a simple way. Really kept my interest and attention throughout. Very well written and told.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It's more a speed completion than other versions I have played, if you get stuck then it just resets the tiles, but it is very enjoyable nonetheless
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Each episode is fast paced and exciting and there is always something at the end to make you want more.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|My sister and I missed it in the theater so we were really happy to finally watch it.  We both really liked it as well.  It was a great movie experience! But like anything in life we all have our own opinions.  This type of movie is not for everyone but my sister and I enjoy these types of films and we like Will Smith.
B0085A9J18|3.0|I have seen better movies with better plots also when I played the movie I had to restart it and change the language from Spanish to English I never had this happen before.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Great picross type of game, alot of challenging levels to work on. I love these typesbof games and this is one of the better ones on the android platform
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I am really enjoying the practical thoughts James is bringing to the topic of how to live for your own self fulfillment and in turn make lots of money and in turn benefit those around you.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|I have a kindle fire HD and I really like this Facebook but unfortunately it crashes all the time or goes slow and gets on my nerves.
B00AW8VUDG|4.0|this album sounds GREAT, fantastic vocals , pure guitar power but misses identity.<br />their albums &#34;metal rendez-vous&#34;, &#34;hardware&#34;, &#34;headhunter&#34; and even &#34;the blitz&#34; sound much more unique, Krokus stylish.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I liked the book.  I didn't even know that the orphan trains existed.  I love a good story that leaves me with a little new knowledge of history.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Too soon to say &#34;I love it&#34; because there is a lot going on and until we see more of the direction of the series, I'll hold off giving it accolades.  It is a &#34;thinking person's&#34; look at the Agency versus those who mean us harm.
1423170148|5.0|The book uses rhyming to follow each sister in their frustration at the other sister. It's focus was on having siblings be themselves, and was very moving. The visuals are breathtaking, as Brittney Lee was also a visual development artist on the film. A must buy for any Disney fan, especially those who can't wait for Frozen! (Note - the book is very light on spoilers, nothing the trailers haven't given away.)
B008Y212PI|5.0|Liked it well enough. Enjoyed it. The review must be longer. So I thought the 5x5 puzzles fit the screen nicely.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Continues the story that has captured the Colonies. I love it!  I downloaded it to my TiVo, and it is easy to watch whoever.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This game is fun and entertaining.  It's good for children and adults alike. I will recommend this game to my friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fabulous series... The best show ever! From the cast to the costumes... It is spell bounding ! We will continue to watch this great show!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Daughter Loves this game!! Think we got it for free...<br />Good pass time game, for adults and children.<br />Thanks!!
B00F35BV64|4.0|Of all of the recent action movies, I think the Star Trek reboot has been among the best.  Good story, solid pacing, pretty decent acting all things considered.  They've done a good job of taking existing iconic characters and making them their own.
B004GYY714|5.0|I just love it, I live in Italy and I still can hear my favorite radio station. I strongly recommend this app to anybody is perfect.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I have enjoyed temple run  but stopped due to seemingly not getting anywhere. With Oz, I was in the balloon within a little while. Also continual game starts was well worth the $.99 cost. Great game.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|You are a (beep) and a (breeders) mom dad grandma hoarse pizza sandwich lookup hug Billy bop booger face McGee
B00E7SFAAG|4.0|Enjoyed this for far too long last night and succeeded in alienating my husband, hah.  Fun, simplistic and easy to master.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|You may as well forget what you were doing previously to playing this game.  Once you start it, you just want to keep moving up to the next floor.
B00F35BV64|2.0|Movie was a little drawn out.  The actor selection was good and seemed true to their counterparts on the tv show.  The movie had great potential but missed its mark.  Its not a waste of time to  watch but could have been done much better.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This game is like a dream come true for veterans of Magic. There's finally a feature to make your own deck! Game is a solid upgrade from previous editions.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|One of the best series ever!! Can't wait to see the next episodes.  Transports me to another time another place!
B00CTT9646|4.0|Really enjoyed the movie. More of an action flick than a traditional Star Trek adventure but still entertaining.<br /><br />The phaser was a little disappointing. I already have the previous version which I feel has a better finish. The only difference besides the slight color variance is this version has the ability to change from &#34;stun&#34; to &#34;kill&#34; but there is no button to engage the mechanism. You have to rotate it manually. Once changed the mechanism will stay firmly in place but the &#34;stun&#34; side slightly hits the bottom of the rotation area and caused a slight scratch in mine when I rotated it. My phaser also arrived with other minor scratches in the finish. That was disappointing considdering that my original version arrived in perfect condition. Having said all that, the sculpt is excellent! It's movie accurate and has a good weight to it thanks to its metal finishes. It makes and excellent piece for any sci-fi display. Hopefully yours arrives with fewer scratches.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I bought this because i like the transformers series and this movie came in great condition! well worth the purchase!
B003VANOFY|3.0|cheapest 7.1 with wirless , the ear pads sucks swet get all over it , the mic is wors than 5$ mic
6305510016|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my son and his new wife for part of a wedding gift, as we are taking them to see the Titanic exhibit in Buena Park on the 19th
B00846TTDG|5.0|Very good portrayal of actual scenarios; nice to use actual soldiers.  They deserve so much more credit than they get.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|This is an oldie but goodie that we have watched numerous times.  It's a real classic and funny.  If you haven't seen it, do so.
0553296981|5.0|The book is excellent and it came in a timely fashion. I highly recommend to anyone interested in learning about one of the saddest moments in history.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|My 11 year old son loves it. I found the app and downloaded it on my kindle.  He has thanked me several times.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you're not using this, download it now.  You will love it.  If some of the versions confuse you, choose an easier one like ESV or NLT.  You can make notes, bookmarks... It is very easy get move around.  Love this app... one of my favorites.
B00CIAYTL6|5.0|This movie greatly brought out Ip Man's perseverance and modesty. He is a very humble man. Showing his strength to Japan and America now is a very big thing. This was a very fun and entertaining movie to watch, and I recommend it to all, who can handle fighting.
B007XF4J70|5.0|A lovely enhanced version of a film classic. Bogart and Bergman at their best. Good keepsake. Would recommed this purchase.
B00CB3N5DS|5.0|This movie was outstanding. It was perfectly action packed with emotionally difficulties. You start to care for the characters and want Ip Man to always win.  I don't regret buying this permanently. It's so great i'd watch it more than twice. I recommended this to all who can handle watching fighting.
0099448599|3.0|A very good read, interesting information presented in a very good story-line, well done characters, and an exciting climax.  I recommend it highly.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I love love love this movie! It's always going to be one that I can go back & watch & remember my childhood lol
B00821OX98|2.0|Meh at best, Pilot fell short of keeping me interested to a second episode.  Might be something that is slow going, which is fine, just not what i was looking for.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Restraunt Story is a TeamLava game where you can make your own restraunt and you can make food! I love this game and is recommended for all ages!
B00E0SXNE8|3.0|The animation is beautiful, but the story itself and the entertainment value just fell short for me.  My 6yr old daughter on the other hand loved it, but that's not setting the bar too high.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|An free of charge office software which is easy to use and very clear to see, just like on your laptop.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved everything:  easy reading, intense characters, and some you come to love or identify with.  Glad her and Peeta have each other again.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|I thought this was a 3-D movie as they told me it related to the 3-D glasses.  I am planning to return it.
0062215507|5.0|FANTASTIC book! Perfect for a lover of the movies. Shows how everything evolved from the first to the last. The inserts were superb. Avoid buying at book stores. Every one I found was damaged in some way. This one from Amazon was still perfectly wrapped and in mint condition.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|It was a very good who done it and romance book. Very well written.  Had good twist in it. II couldn't put it down.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|One thing leads to another, one secret , etc.  How tragic most people don't realize this.  So much like life, so interesting & entertaining.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and the way in which she told her story.
B002OSXDAU|5.0|Atlas Shrugged is my very favorite book of all time, it has spoken to my soul, my values, and my career path.  Dagney Taggart, John Galt, collapse of society do to adoption of the welfare state, greed, and unwillingness of those who contribute to support those who are able, but unwilling to contribute.  I have actually read Atlas Shrugged three different times (ok, the first time I skipped part of the monologue).
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Great movie, Great acting, humor throughout the entire movie!<br />Very entertaining and if you get a chance try to read about the background of the movie. It's awesome too. It's one of those that you keep thinking about for days.
B000R3NNDQ|4.0|I enjoyed reading this story about penguins in a crisis. The approach of using a fable like story to address the complexities of implementing dramatic change is both entertaining and informative. I only rated it 4 stars because I felt that at times it was too simplistic. It certainly gave examples of the issues and the resistances and steps to follow to sell and implement change, but it didn't really do much to address the bigger issues or conflict resolution in the actual solution of a major problem.
B008M721MS|5.0|Yea I love this app, because you can video chat friends and message them.<br />I think it's really awesome, but the problem was that when I try to get on it takes to long to load quick enough but it is still a great app and I love it thinks now I can do more.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Read it in two days. It was wonderful spending my time back in the imagination of my favorite author. Being back in Danny Torrance's life again and seeing how he's grown up was a real treat. Stephen King: \\"You done good\\".
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Love Tina Fey. This book is so intertaining. Easy read and funny as all get out. You won't be dissappointed.
B005LAIIGM|5.0|Cast:<br /><br />Sandra Bullock -- Dr. Ryan Stone<br />George Clooney -- Matt Kowalski<br />Ed Harris  -- Mission Control (voice)<br /><br />Director:<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron<br /><br />Writers:<br /><br />Alfonso Cuaron, Jonas Cuaron<br /><br />A NASA space mission to attach an antennae to the Hubble telescope goes wrong when a Russian missile destroys one of their satellites and the resultant debris field wreaks havoc. The two remaining astronauts, Kowalski, the mission commander and NASA veteran, and Dr. Stone, a genius who has had only six months' training and is there only to attach the device she created, are stuck in space and must devise their own rescue.<br /><br />\\"Gravity\\" is one of the best choreographed, most visually awe-inspiring films I have ever seen. From the moment the film came on, I was lost in space, my hands gripping the seat, and my heart hammering. The music was a beautiful counterpoint, emphasizing the key moments without overwhelming viewers.<br /><br />We saw the film in IMAX in an RPX environment--essentially, Regal charges extra for leather seats, widescreen and upgraded sound. It was worth the near double price of the ticket. \\"Gravity\\" is the best film I have seen in a long time.<br /><br />This is probably one of the most researched films in history and the hard work really paid off. \\"Gravity\\" took 4.5 years to make. Sandra Bullock said choreographing the zero gravity pushed her body to the utter limits.  While rehearsing, Bullock had contact with a real astronaut, Catherine \\"Cady\\" Coleman, who sent her texts from outer space to tell her various aspects of her job. When Coleman finally got to see the film, she said it was one of the best depictions of her work she'd ever seen.<br /><br />WARNING:  Some people have complained about dizziness and nausea from viewing the film. People with vertigo and problems with 3D should probably not see \\"Gravity\\" in 3D. I have vertigo and did not have a problem with the standard version, but your mileage could vary depending on what your triggers are.<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, October 2013
1416972250|3.0|I give it three stars because I know it's a YA book, and I'm sure lots of teens will love it.  I have to say that the ending was less than what I expected.  I mean, I knew everything that was going to happen well before it did, but I thought our reward would be a huge, earth-shattering, tear-inducing moment of reunited love between Clary and Jace.<br /><br />Most of the things that were mundane about this book ;)  I wrote off due to the intended audience.... but I really hoped for more of a pay-off for waiting the entire three books for Clary and Jace.<br /><br />Oh well!  I agree that it wasn't life-altering, but as someone else stated - if you have time to kill, it's worth the effort.
B001TXWJ4M|1.0|Violent, sadistic behavior; plot filled with personal betrayals; main character has no character and is unable to look deeply at his own issues. I guess that's what people are looking for. But not me.
B000002NIW|5.0|It was exactly what I wanted, by far my favorite Deftones album. I am so glad I have this in my collection.
B004JLDSIC|5.0|Great jazz, well performed and a delight to listen to.  Stacey's voice is like none I've heard since Billie Holliday
1780721676|4.0|I would recommend this book and this diet to anyone who wants to lose a few pounds and has tried everything and nothing has worked before.  Also, I would recommend it to anyone who is tired of starving themselves day in and day out and not seeing results like I was.  I saw results after the very first week.  Like it says in the book, you know you can do it because the next day, you can go back to eating regularly!  And i'm a vegetarian and most diets do not cater to me.  This way, I can eat the way I want, I just need to pay attention to the calorie count.
0307279189|5.0|Inspiring book for anybody involved in or interested in endurance sports. I found the history fascinating and have changed my running style to what I believe is a much healthier habit
B00847KFDS|5.0|Outstanding. Wish he was actively writing new stuff. Plenty to be angry about today, and we need someone who can relate to the older generation and point out the facts of life, just as Woody Gunthrie was the voice of my fathers generation. Great music now and for ever.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie!  What a wonderful story.  I really loved this book.  Took longer to read it because I did not want to finish it...if that makes sense.  This book had me by the first several pages.  Can't remember whether this was fiction or non-fiction.  However, if Ms. Adichie wrote this about her life...she really told the story well.  This book convinced me to read &#34;Puple Hibiscus&#34; a wonderful novel as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show. Clean; conservative; family oriented; historically inspiring.  I just wish that things will always end as I expect, but they don't... just like real life.
B006RXQASA|2.0|that was a turn off and it wasnt that funny to me, only got like 20 minutes in before i couldnt take anymore
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed this book.  We often study the soldiers, but this is about those left home, on both sides.  Unique and enjoyable.
B000OCXIDK|4.0|And moving tale.  A memorable picture woven  from sparse facts and good research -- highlighted with emotion and a surprising, but satisfying ending.  Loved this author.

B00F91H666|5.0|I knew it was going to be a 4 or 5 star movie.  I waited until I could watch it on Amazon because I was afraid<br />I'd be too fearful to sit  thru a big screen version. Good decision.  Crystal clear quality and I could stop it<br />when  terrified and start it again.  Thanks, Amazon

B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love this show! I own all 8 seasons and enjoy re-watching them as each new season comes out. The guys are funny, vulnerable, and sexy as heck!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|After reading the first two books I was totally hyped and excited about book three.  For me it was just okay... alright.  Nothing earth shattering and the ending was quite dull.  I will think twice before I invest my in another book my E. L. James and will definitely think three times before I read any of her trilogys.
B00005JOFQ|1.0|I would never have bought this movie except my sister wanted it. I hate bad endings and that's the only reason I hate the movie! The acting is great and all that, but, sorry, I'm all about happy endings and not misery and life lessons! I think SHE like the movie though!

0061122416|5.0|I connected with this book more than most. If you're looking for answers, this book will definitely help you along the way.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I had a hard time getting through the Great Gatsby.  I love Leo DiCaprio is the reason I rented it.  Toby McGuire carried the movie and he was good in it; Gatsby wasn't prominent enough in the movie and it was just plain boring to me.  It wasn't smooth watching.  Too much 1920's era stuff going on and not enough story. The parties were overdone. I watched it in patches not all at once - only finished watching it because I paid for it! It was painful to watch. Sorry Leonardo DiCaprio - I think you're a great actor and can do so much better!
B00594XOZU|1.0|I used kik on my kindle before now all of a sudden it doesnt want to load anymore it needs to be fixed
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Love NCIS! Have been watching from season 1 and will hate the day they decide to call it quits! Miss Ziva already - the sparks between the team members is great! Ziva made a great addition to the team after Kate left the show - Tony, Ziva, and Tim made a great team!
B002CIY8EM|4.0|This product works satisfactory and I am very happy with it and recommend to anyone who buys it will also be pleased to find that it was also shipped on time and in excellent condition.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|The app works, the customer service is 5 star quality, and the usage is very good.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Addicting! I have blown through all 3 seasons and now I've got my mother hooked. A show that can capture all ages with only a few scenes inappropriate for children. Nice to have a show without tons of vulgarity.
B000W15AQ6|5.0|I love eminem. This album is one of his best in my opinion. I recommend it to slim shady fans.
B003EI2EH2|1.0|The author is very inconsistent in his advise on diet ...in my opinion almost worthless.<br />He advocates one thing in a chapter then changes in another.<br />Regarding Kindle, page numbers must be displayed before I purchase another ebook.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|I really enjoyed this. I ordered it to come on the day it was first available, and it arrived just on time! The quality is really good and on each disk there's bonus features on top of the blooper reel. Overall, I'm glad I bought it so I could be up to speed for season 9. :)
B003YL4LYI|2.0|To many characters, all over the place. It's like Martin had 10 short stories and he's trying like hell to get them into a coherent whole. I personally think he is taking his fans for a couple of extra book rides. Love to see how HBO handles this one!
B0013ND30M|5.0|I have been searching everywhere for a brand new DVD of Sleeping Beauty. And this DVD was still sealed in the original case, no scratches, and at a great price!
B004X6PRO6|3.0|So many people disappear and another person takes their name I couldn't keep up. It was also to unbelievable. I know its fiction but to over state the dysfunction of North Korea is a disservice to readers.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I could not put it down!  Absolutely loved this book.  Now I have to go back and read The Shining again.  It has been too long since I read it last.
B005LAIIMG|4.0|I rented this on Blu-ray from my local grocery store for $2. I like Zombie movies so it kept me entertained for a while.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|Good acting, script at least relates to the Austin original, and some of the author's humor comes through well. A pleasant period romance.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|This remains one of the very best shows on TV, network or cable, but this season felt a bit tired and strained to me. The season end cliffhanger was effective though, and I'm looking forward to the new season.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|enjoyed this game<br />typical of this developer. nice mix of HO scenes and mini-games. the strategy guide came in handy.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|Piper Kerman professes to be smarter, nicer, and just about better than her fellow prisoners, the staff, the US government, her co-conspirators, etc. her holier than thou attitude poisons the entire book.
0307341550|1.0|Read Gone Girl, and LOVED it. Couldn't wait to go back & read Flynn's first novel.<br />This is just a dreadful book, in every sense of the word. I agree 100% with all of the 1 star reviews. Each & every character is thoroughly unlikeable. The dialogue is bizarre. The actions of the characters defy logic. The main character is obviously a scarred person, in about every way a person can be scarred, and you'd think she'd engender a little sympathy, but she does not. The killer is in plain sight the whole time.<br />If you enjoy plumbing the depths of depravity of the human spirit, just for its own sake, and without the benefit of sympathetic characters or even the writing flourish Flynn would later demonstrate in Gone Girl, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, lets just say I hope Gone Girl demonstrates that Flynn has grown enormously as a writer, & look forward to her next effort.
0061537969|1.0|If you only know one thing about this book, you know that it's written from the perspective of a dog. It felt like a failed attempt at combining the peripheral narrator in The Greaty Gatsby with the loveable lab from Marley and Me. The dog's perspective sounded too much like the author's (self-indulgent) voice. It was a wasted use of a creative plot device that could have potentially added substance to the right story. In this case, it seemed like having a dog narrate this book was a cheap marketing gimmick, riding the tailwind of success from Marley and Me. There is even a picture of a yellow lab on the cover that looks like Marley even though the dog in Racing in the Rain was a terrier mutt.<br /><br />Enzo (the dog-narrator) is much too anthropomorphized to make the story feel as if a dog is actually the one telling it. After Enzo's introduction, the fact that the narrator is a dog becomes completely irrelevant.<br /><br />At one point I had hoped we were going to get a voyeuristic glimpse into how a family copes with grief and loss. People tell their dogs things that they won't even admit to their spouses, best friends, therapists, because dogs can't tell your secrets and they can't judge you. Enzo could have held the whole family's deepest darkest secrets. Instead, there is almost no discussion of any of the characters' thoughts, emotions, or motivations in the entire book.<br /><br />My other complaint about the book is that after the plot twist (spoiler alert), we find out that the book is actually all about a questionable report of statutory rape. What follows is the completely illogical investigation and trial. I couldn't shake the feeling that the author was minimizing actual statutory rape. In the book the main character (Denny) lets an under-age teenage girl spend the night at his house. I wasn't buying the logic for how Denny let her invite herself over. Then the author has this teenager go into this adult male's room naked and she initiates some vaguesexual activity while the guy is asleep. That sounds like the fantasy of a dirty old man <cough> Garth Stein <cough>. Enzo doesn't shed any light onto what really happened, because he just says stuff like \\"I won't let myself think anything bad about Denny.\\"<br /><br />The only reason I kept reading was so I could write this review.<br /><br />One of the lowest points was when Denny runs into the teenager at a coffee shop while they are still awaiting trial. He confronts her and guilt trips her into recanting (which she does).<br /><br />I didn't even care that Enzo actually SPOKE as a witness in the trial, because I was already so done with the book.<br /><br />It could have been so much better, but what we ended up with was a formulaic book written for the movie by a Hollywood producer who knew he could put in minimal effort and still get rich. Personally, I wouldn't let my teenage daughter get any closer to him than to Roman Polanski.
B00006RAKP|5.0|Masterful compilation of EJ's 34 classic songs. The cd quality doesn't get better than this. It is pure acoustical magic!
0345545338|5.0|Grisham weaves a story line like one you could never dream of, making this a true edge-of-your-seat thriller.  &#34;Gotcha!&#34; is the applicable one-word description!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|It's a magical treat for the whole family! (The parrots are very mindfully depicted here. Someone who is very familiar with these great birds must have had a lot of input into this cartoon -the bird characters to underline their intelligent and animated bird qualities).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It's not quite as compelling as Seasons 1 and 2, but still so much better than everything else on television. I'm very interested to see where it will go next.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|Dark and difficult to view on a smaller screen I felt the story's focus was misplaced. Mighta been nice to have better understanding of the.bas guys psychotic break.
1400069807|5.0|A must read for a healthy America.  The book delivers all it promised and more.  All dieticians should have and read this book so they can keep their patients informed.
B00BFV1JZI|5.0|I love reading a book where the author is invisible and this is one of those books.  I devoured the books one after the other not wanting the story to go on with out me.  Ms  Collins has captured the horror and futility of war, not to mention the wasted lives of children torn apart and forever maimed by the experience.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Oh my God the best book I have read in a long time!  I too have often wondered what happened to Danny.  I like the man he has become.  I loved this book, I never wanted it to end!  I would love to sit here and rehash the whole book from beginning to end but it would take to long.  I love that in the end Jack was there to help his son and granddaughter.  That made it even more special!  Stephen never stop writing because you can never be topped. You have always been my favorite wrier and always will be forever!
B00E3BK0QQ|3.0|As usual this. Was not worth 5 bucks they suck you in then pay up and then you have already played the best part its downhill from here and the ending is nothing if not predictable the game should be longer and have a real ending. Not just so they can continue the story in parts there is a differance between sequal and dissecting a story
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a good game most people like it you should get the app is is grat. get it.  I love this game
B00EQF0JJC|1.0|And I'm not just talking about the digitally processed \\"black and white\\" film. But, I will talk about that, because it was the first thing I noticed about the film and didn't like.<br /><br />The choice to do the film in black and white was I am sure well-intentioned, but it didn't serve any purpose that I could see, and it actually made the film less interesting to watch. And before someone jumps in and accuses me of not understanding the nuances of black and white film making, let me just note that I like a lot of black and white classic films perfectly well. Colorized \\"Casablanca,\\" for example, is just a travesty. \\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\" is perfect in black and white, as are all the film noir classics. \\"Some Like it Hot\\" never fails to entertain, nor does \\"All About Eve,\\" and all of them are in black and white.<br /><br />So, yeah, back to \\"Much Ado About Nothing.\\" The problem with the black and white in this film is that there isn't enough contrast in the film--there are no really pure whites and no pure blacks so it all comes across as bland shades of grey, and unfortunately, it makes the already very similar looking actors look even more alike. So, yeah. Not good.<br /><br />And then there is the \\"acting.\\" I've seen plenty of the actors in other films, and there is nothing wrong with their acting ability, except in this film. Wooden doesn't even begin to describe them. The lines are just being said, with no emotion behind them. Amy Acker, who plays Beatrice comes across as just a whiny, naggy bitch, not a witty, independent woman, and her squeaky voice worked my last nerve.<br /><br />Thank God, I didn't go see it in a theater; I'd have been really upset to have wasted full ticket price on this boring, sad version of what is actually one of my favorites of Shakespeare's plays.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|I needed something that would allow me to access files and install them. This is the perfect item. Simple to use and does what I need quickly
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Brilliantly imaginative and fantastically adventurous; a reminder that childhood fantasy and innocence are fastidiously legal and still very much alive.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie, I remember seeing this as a kid when it first came out. It really gets me into the Halloween spirit. Every Halloween I have to watch it(chances are Disney will show it, but I hate commercials)I even get into a Hocus Pocus mood and watch it outside of Halloween.. Its fun for all ages, funny, catchy one liners, and just makes me feel young again. 20 years later still a top 5 must see at Halloween(who says that it has to always be scary movies)
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|The movie MUD is a must see!  The friendship between the two boys and Matthew is wonderful to see.  The movie will lead you to believe one thing but it turns out differently.  I did not like the cursing by the boys but it actually does fit well with the feeling of the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show!!  We really enjoyed the series and cannot wait to see more!!  The actors on the show are really talented.
B0050N8N0Q|4.0|Really good album. A few songs are meh, but overall I like it. I was glad it was on the $5.00 promotional deal.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I gained so much more of a live view of the history that will help me as I read the Bible.  I cried when I read about the cruelty and disregard for life. I have a deeper understanding of the time that Jesus lived and his followers.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am a Jane Eyre Junkie.<br />It's true.<br />I have seen every version of the novel released in the US and I think this one is my favorite. While no cinematic representation of the book is without its faults, I love the length and detail that this one provides.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|The movie is a pleasant, if predictable, romp.  The quality of the picture is amazing though.  There are no extra features worth mentioning, this is very disappointing.
B000TEUSJK|4.0|Caligula is very different. I wasn't expecting the amount of violence nor the amount of sexual situations that were present in the movie.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I downloaded this tonight, and I love it already.  Very user-friendly with lots of options.  I like how there is an option to either edit an existing picture or to capture a new one.  To the dev team who put this together -- excellent job, keep up the great work!!
B0090CVJZ4|5.0|Love these. If you have ever fiumbled around with connections for speakers on the limited area on the back of your amp you will love these connectors.
B005GSZZ1A|3.0|Okay, I admit it; I like books with a modicum of pleasantry.  SO, that is why I couldn't finish reading this book.<br /><br />I quit listening to it when he was describing the torture after his mother and brother attempt an escape; truly it was just too painful for me to continue.<br /><br />So, I'm not in a good position to review it, except to say this.  IF this book is true, North Korea is even more evil than we imagined.  I have no reason to doubt the book, so it means that NK and its government are PURE EVIL.  I cannot imagine living under the conditions he describes; hatred, anger, snitching, stealing food from his mother....<br /><br />And, it makes me angry that Dennis Rodman would coddle up to the current leader of North Korea.<br /><br />If you don't mind reading about sad, sadder, saddest; then you might be enlightened by this book.  I feel like I had a taste of the horribleness, and didn't need any more to see just what evil lurks in the country of North Korea.
B00E72OKAS|5.0|this game is so cool! you have to buy new cars and upgrades to win the game. can you win in less than 37 days?
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Because it has better sound and picture than the regular mobile youtube.My son loves to use it!  I have an easier time searching as well
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved the e book couldn't put it down!! Recommend to everyone! Would make a great movie please go and read !
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|if you love star wars this angry birds is awesome. I enjoy playing this and pretty much is easy to do.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love how you can draw and make your own pictures,but I would like to be able to add more decorations to it. But I like how you can draw on a picture to make it more beautiful :)
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Reminds me a little of the Will Smith movie &#34;I Am Legend&#34;. A sudden breakout of a viral disease. A search for a cure. People die and the worlds population comes close to extinction. Then at the very end just before all hope is lost, viola, problem solved.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It was a good story.  I just couldn't put it down. I was totally surprised at the ending. I used it for an 8th grade book report.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|This is why I have listen to Earth , Wind and Fire from day one . The new album sounds great and  has that vintage EWF sound
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|This game is totally awesome as my grandson would say, He enjoys it as much as I do The graphics are high quality lots of laughs super fun you will not be disappointed with this one
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun but it keeps freezing and buffering I hate when it does that but other than that it done
B00594XOZU|1.0|It said some will help me I have been waiting over two to three months  for some one to fix it, I like it but if I can't log back in I will send another complaint
B009P1WES6|5.0|Very different to dine cri e fiction.  The plot unfolds to provide twists and turns a reader doesn't expect.  The main character is unique, a dwarf detective with an twisted mentality.  Highly the recommended for anyone who wants to read something macabre and different.
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|This is how you do a concept album. From start to finish, every song and interlude flows together perfectly. I rarely love an entire album this much. Janelle Monae is an exceptionally talented singer and songwriter!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love this CD and can't top playing it every time I'm in my car. Only problem is I start singing and m kids get annoyed!  They say I can't carry a tune (they're right! Lol)
B00F91H15W|4.0|I liked it.  Emma Watson was fantastic. She did a really good job getting into the character of Alexis Niers (one of the original bling ringers). She had the voice and demeanor down completely.  I don't know if I could watch it again, it was a little off-putting at times, especially because the main girl, or ring leader ( I forgot her name) has no concept of right and wrong. Which I know is the one of the points of the story, but I just don't understand how she stole things so freely.  If you watch the movie, keep in mind that it is done really well, the reason it may be hard to watch is because the individuals are not aware of how disgusting are not aware of their wrong doings.
030746363X|1.0|Hey yo, Tim - if it takes you 15 minutes to get your girl off (especially with the clitoris....), YOU'RE DOING IT WRONG! 15 minutes of stroking?! FIFTEEN? And still nothing? Maybe she's just not that into you, fellas.<br /><br />Anywho, the rest about eating whole, nutrient-dense, low glycemic/ low carb foods with room for a treat every now and then isn't some secret science either.<br /><br />This book is an expensive door stop.
B008FWHGYS|4.0|I usually do not like movies of this kind, where there are interconnecting subplots, but this is the best I have ever seen.  The only reason I would not give it five stars is the aforementioned fact that these are not my favorite movies.  All the characters were totally believable and subplots were well constructed.  Bravo!
B008RKGFTK|3.0|&#34;American Gigolo&#34; is a fun, campy ride back in time.  On that level, it is wildly entertaining.  Is it a good movie?  No.  Still, it is oddly compelling.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Jesus crist ive never played the game but I cant download cause it says I'm running low on internal storage when I have 5.36 gigs free God its annoying
B00EE3FVSU|4.0|Wonderful and engrossing. Seems a shocking premise: the death of a child. Did figure out the culprit early on but it was still captivating. Great character development and beautifully presented.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This DVD set is a Big Bang dvd set so need I say more other than this set is awesome. I have not gotten a Big Bang set that wasn't great.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|Terriffic-what grew music-thoroughly enjoyable if you like movie music. Item arrived in good time and as described. Thank you very much.
B00FEN1C50|4.0|Great story and graphics.  Only just too dark.  All fight scenes are at night or under water.  But even that didn't detract from the excitement.
1476733953|3.0|After reading all of these other reviews, I was expecting a life-changing read.  I was expecting a work of fiction that would stick with me from here on out.  Uhhh...just finished the book and not so much.  It's good.  Sure.  Interesting ideas that lead to a decent story.  Amazing?  Excellent?  A \\"real page-turner\\"?  Not for me.  I love other sci-fi/dystopian stuff, but this one was just whatever.  Maybe it really gets going in book 2.  Who knows?  After 508 pages I think I'll move on to something else.  If you like this, I highly recommend the virtually unknown and highly-underrated \\"The Knife of Never Letting Go\\".  Now this is a book I'll never forget.
B00F35BV64|4.0|The first five minutes were amazing but I really wished the rest of the movie had been paced a -little- slower. Parts of the plot seemed rushed and character development was too often neglected. None the less action packed and worth watching for any fan of Star Trek.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|FAbulous!!!!!<br />Back to storytelling at its best!<br />Loved the characters, the pace and all of the links to the past.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I like how the Diamond Edition includes a \\"Crab-E-Oke\\" sing along when ever the movie is paused for the inevitable potty breaks.  The voice for Sebastian is different but sounds close enough.  Another new extra is Carly Rae Jepson's music video and rendition of \\"Part of Your World\\".  All of the previous DVD extras are bundled in as well.  The video quality has been further restored compared to the 2006 platinum DVD copy we own and the 7.1 speaker support is another welcome feature. For those who have not owned the Little Mermaid in disc format, this is a worthy purchase.
B00F52YOPA|4.0|I went through it so fast, I was hoping there were other rooms to design after the initial was completed.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|In the end, the quality of writing is pulp fiction junk. Just your basic love story. Disappointed. Lots of crazy people put there.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this game was wikid but it took forever to load it is awesome though really Cool to I loved it don't waste your money and get it!!!
1451695187|5.0|This is not my first reading of NDE, but is one of the highest credibility.  Eben Alexander entered a realm that defies full explanation.  His cognitive brain was not working, his body vegatative, yet he returned to bring us details, images, understandings that speak of other dimensions in which our spiritual selves are fully alive and loved beyond measure.  To absorb this knowledge as deeply as possible while still in our physical, temporal experience is to live free of the fear of death and in the warm embrace of the Divine.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Absolutely wonderful ending for this series. What a great ending for a series that spans nearly two decades. Thank you.
B0000057C5|5.0|One of my all time favorite cd's. German is the language of anger, which I agree. Tills voice is awesome. Thank you ! Corey

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Edward is flawless and Jessica adorable. This movie was great, it leaves you wondering what the heck is going on all the way up until the end. It is a classic if you ask me.
B004UIOUHC|3.0|My main reason for using Op we ra on my Kindle Fire HD was it's features to enlarge the text with a double-tap. Now they've devolved this important feature as well as the app's text itself is often difficult to read because of its small size.<br /><br />This refers to the new Opera 16, The settings have been simplified giving the user less control. Text wrap is of by default and double-tap does not enlarge the text as large as before. Can no t edit the&quot;speed dial&quot; and the title text for the links is much too small. These issues and the ridiculously small text in some parts of the app itself is just poor implementation for a product meant for smart phones and tablets.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|With the exception of paying real money for the good gear, this game has great content, controls and customisation. Unfortunately, in order to progress, you need to spend hours grinding for XP and money. Health potions are nonexistent unless you wait 6 hours for the maximum of 3 or again spend real money.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Jewels Star was fun but I quickly got to the end of all levels and can't play it any longer.
B003PPDBQ2|5.0|This book hooks you in and keeps flowing. Thoroughly enjoyable read even though the topic is a bit grim.<br />Recommend to those who like a detection type novel.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I watched this on my daughter's recommendation.  Did not like being terrified, but it actually is a good story of survival.  I can't wait for season 4!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Outstanding all the way around.  If I still collected DVDs, I would buy this in a NY minute.  Rush and Firth earned their pay.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|We have come to love the Masterpiece Mystery style British shows.  They are so smart and not at all predictable.  We got the first 4 episodes on our cable tv, but for some reason last 4 weren't available.  We found them on Amazon and bought the instant download so we could find out &#34;whodunnit&#34;!  Awesome story, great acting and we were shocked at the ending!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My little cousin's and the kids I babysit really enjoy it, so for me the app does what's needed when I need to have them occupied or I'm putting another child to sleep. It's easy to use while still providing some challenge and is safe for all ages
B0014C0BMU|5.0|The Matrix Trilogy has gained a well deserved reputation as a classic.  We watched it again after several years - and enjoyed it as much as first time round.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I was watching videos but now it's just saying youtube stopped<br /> when I tryed to search other than that it's good fix that bug plz
B00E0SX118|4.0|I think it was very entertaining funny a great movie for adults and kids Just get the whole family involved
B009WUBERW|5.0|Almost a parody of action movies of the past. An all star cast of actions hero's including Bruce, Arnold, and Chuck Norris. A mindless romp of non stop action built around a decent plot line. Not for everyone, but if you enjoy this sort of movie, this ones a can't miss. Can't wait for Expendables 3.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|Just ok...had a phone call so stopped watching 1/2 way through, haven't watched the rest. Does that tell you anything :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Period. Just a fantastic voyage into a creepy world where reality and fantasy mix together in a story that will have you turning pages while you catch your breath...

B0014BECF8|5.0|Nothing but good things can I say about this CD and the person/persons who sold it to me. I love it and listen  almost everyday to it.
B00B3L3RPA|5.0|you can never go wrong with a classic, The book was great, I read it on my kindle and I could not put it down. forget all you preconceptions and just enjoy the read I guarantee you will fall in love too!
B006M4F67A|3.0|I play a lot of Mahjong games and this one needs some changes and challenges added to it to make it interesting.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and I am now reading the books in the series. I hope they come out with another movie to continue the storyline.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|My general thoughts are that I lost interest in doing the experiments after the 2nd or 3rd one. It's not that it's hard to follow the instructions its just I don't think i was participating well enough. I will hopefully come back one day and give it a more honest effort and speak of the results then.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love all three! The 1st & third one are really good, but This one is my fav! :) it shows more of Christian as a normal guy then the always mad billionaire you read about in the 1st
B00B5P37IG|2.0|Downloaded and could not find anything local to watch.  Very poor selection and quality.  Waste of money and time. don't bother.
B006C45CFG|4.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be. I was expecting little plot and mostly spectacle, but it ended up having some solid plot to it as well as some decent character development. I would recommend checking it out at least once.
B00EQRPFGC|5.0|This song is so beautiful!  John Legend has done it again!  This song describes true love between two people  :-)
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app because I can hear my favorite news on radio, MVS in my cell phone, an before I couldn't do that
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I really liked this movie and how they meld this movie with the older ones. Can't wait for the third one
B00F91RYL8|4.0|A lot of reviews were ho-hum about this movie, but I enjoyed it. It had solid action and suspense from start to finish. The plot was overall pretty believable.
B00EA5HEM8|5.0|The kids loved this book and getting to create their own dot after we read it!  I would however recommend getting the actual book rather than the digital version.  The pictures in the digital version were too small for the large group to see
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever 2 things not to buy 2survivalcraft 1 craftsmen don't get fooled with the minecraft titles just by minecraft
B0075PYG1M|5.0|A Grand Slam Home Run that's the only way I can describe Black Radio after purchasing the mp3 version of this break out Album from Robert Glasper Experiment that features excellent versions of Kurt Cobain's Smells LikeTeam Spirit and Afro Blue sung by Eryka Badu. It's been a long time since I became instantly hooked on an entire Album, instead of 2 or three songs, and have to take my hat off to Glasper for daring to go outside of the formula usually assigned to musicians, in his case Jazz which he makes clear at the end of track 5 Gonna be Alright where he laments being &#34;pigeon holed&#34; into a certain genre and being expected to be like &#34;Charlie Parker&#34; when that's not who he grew up listening to. All in all a great album with an excellent supporting cast that's why I give it 5 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this Solitaire! ! ! !<br />I am way over 13!  By the way it is very improper to ask a lady her age.
B000002LKU|4.0|Mark Knopfler's music is like an old pair of shoes that fit just right. This is such an interesting album because of the contributions from the other players. \\"Weapon of Prayer\\" will stop you in your tracks. Brilliant work here.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|A little cheesy at first but the doctor did not fail to draw me into the show. This show has adventure, comedy, drama and quirkiness. I will warn you that once you are watching a few episodes, you'll never stop. Trust me.. I'm the doctor.
030758836X|4.0|Loved the two crazy voices of two very disturbed characters. The ending was disappointing to me, but I liked it overall.
0316017930|3.0|I liked Tipping Point better.  Outliers is an interesting concept but some of the stories of outliers seemed contrived.  Gladwell includes his own family story in the concluding chapter.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This story follows several families thru decades and wars as their lives intersect.Never a dull moment....never a predictable plot twist.
0486424510|3.0|I'm glad I read it for my book club because if I hadn't felt I had to, I would have stopped.  On the one hand the book is interesting because it is the first English mystery and it does give a sense of the era.  However because it was originally published serially in a newspaper that paid by the word, there are way too many words.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I've liked all of John Grisham's books and this is one of his best. Plot has interesting twists and characters I got to know and like
B005651RDS|5.0|Worthy of praise, an important book written from the soul. A testament to great literature written simply and from the heart
B00CA6WLAE|5.0|This was a awesome book. A must read for young readers who like action and adventure and a fast paced quest.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|It started out a little slow but definitely delivered as a solid story.  I am Looking forward to the next book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game... the picture looks great... it's not hard to fallow... I do recommend this game to a child... or an animal lover like myself.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Fun movie. My 7 year old loved the big animals & explosions. Can be a little scary at times for really young kids - but nothing too major. Cute story about not letting fear run your life.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I still get more use at a later date.  I am on  vacation and do. it have a lot use for a calculator at this time, by l will later.
B00B44XVZC|3.0|As before, this is falling off a bit from the earlier installments. Generally thought this was a bit too dark for my taste.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|So far I have been using it and it seems to give me what I look for. I hope to get much use as I work with it.
B008S0TAY6|3.0|While I have enjoyed the Fables series, these latest installments seem a little bit lost. Still trying to figure out where this story is really going to go.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|my hubby loves it! the first time of using, my hubby won 3 prizes in his club, he's so excited. excellent trade!
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|This is a terrific, remixed and expanded version of The Band's wonderful \\"Rock of Ages.\\"  Since I completely read the description on here and (elsewhere) of exactly what I was getting in this set, there was absolutely NO rip-off of any kind. As far as the price goes, yes it is expensive as are most of these sets, but since no one put a gun to my head and made me buy it, I'm not going to complain about it. I am glad that I bought it.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Love those intergalactic birds and pigs.  Just when I think Angry birds &#34;have arrived&#34; you bring it again!  Yay :)
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is one of the funniest and cleverest movies I have seen in a long time!  Great for adults as well as kids.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|My first experience with Liane Moriarty and I glad I read this book. The characters are wonderful and the intertwining plot lines are so original and engrossing. One of the most original novels I have read in years.
0765338149|5.0|I only read 1-2 books a year but I was hooked as soon as I got this. I finished it in 1 day. I can't wait for the movie.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|Didn't like app at all. Not like the old sticky notes that used to be on my android. Not user friendly. I uninstalled it.
B00B8YSIMY|2.0|I really wanted to like this book.  The main characters were flat, I never really developed an emotional attachment to the story line or characters.  The story could have been great, not a thriller...
B00FOF8W8I|5.0|I was excited to see another release by Peter John. I thoroughly enjoyed his book the Dead Medium and have even given it as a gift. The Rekindled Affair by Peter John is just as enjoyable. This author has a way with characters, you can tell he knows how to sum up a person and spot their quirks, regrets, longings, etc. He has a knack for giving readers an easy sense of how his characters became who they are (the good and the bad) - like real people. This short story is full of life and a nice taste of the author's style. Well worth the time! 5-stars.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Another great book by Nicholas Sparks. Full of twists and turns, and as always, the love we all dream of.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is the best solution I have found for streaming content to my HDTV. Easy to install, flawless streaming at a very affordable cost. Highly recommended.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|This is a fun story that gently pulls you into the center of the adventure and doesn't release you until the last page.  I read the last page with a smile on my face.  Now, that's a fun book!
B005LAIIN0|4.0|Has just about 1% to do with the book but,, that's ok. It's still good.  It does move at a pace which is a little quick considering the distances the main character is assumed to be traveling but the frenetic pace makes it cool at the same time.  And the zombies run really fast while gnashing their teeth! What could be better? :)
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|A great well written book.  Held my interest from the first page.  I had trouble putting it down. Very good read.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|When this show was on the air, I had satellite and couldn't watch it.  I am a HUGE trekkie and couldn't wait to watch it. THANK YOU AMAZON PRIME VIDEOS!!!!
B00F91RYL8|3.0|This is an okay movie, it kept my attention but it ended to abruptly for my liking. Not a movie that I would watch more than once.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I loved the way it made me feel like old times, but gave it a modern new twist. Great job!
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Excelente
B0026SFEW8|5.0|My favorite musical. Something to watch over again (especially as an adult) because there are scenes/words that have a whole different meaning!!! Grease is the word!! I just get goosebumps every time!!
B002KJX4IE|5.0|I loved beetle juice as kid.  My daughter wanted to be it for Halloween so I thought I would get the movie to show her who beetle juice was.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great and easy to use basic calculator. One could not ask for more in a free app.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|Love this app - so easy to use and the effects are amazing!!! Better than any photo editing programmes I have tried
0439813786|5.0|I actually saw the movie first, when it came out. I fell in love with it, and so wanted to read the book. Never got around to it until I took a children's lit class in college and it happened to be our first book to read. The book is just as magical as the movie. The illustrations are gorgeous; they're so interesting and personal. And the story is really cool. I fell in love with all the characters and the plot instantly. It's a beautiful story that is very well done. It's not your typical book. Being able to read a book with so much wonderful artwork is a lovely experience. The way the history of film ties in is also very neat. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B004SIP9GK|4.0|this was fun, mildly offensive (and i say that in reverence) parody of the recent slasher-lite/slasher parody/slasher homages of that time (and a few others, as well).<br /><br />one note about the Blu-ray, however, while it's usually better than the DVD in picture quality, it's one of the worst discs i've seen. i've never seen details not just poor, but outright smeared-looking in places. i can't figure out how to even describe it. maybe like a Photoshop paint filter? also present is haloing from poorly supervised edge enhancement.<br /><br />i haven't seen TOO many of the silver or bronze discs of &#34;a certain site which has a PQ tier ranking system,&#34; but i personally would put this disc in Bronze or Coal instead of Silver where it's currently sitting.
B00821PCJS|4.0|A little dark but if you will give it at least three shows you will get hooked.  Cast plays well off each other and stories are not predictable .
0545586178|5.0|The first book hooked me into readiing the rest.  I do not reccomend it for very young or sensitive readers though.  The plot is a  little disturbing.  If you haven't read the series, do yourself a favor and pick it up today.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Great treatment of an important piece of the ecological puzzle that makes the American West so special. I have spent some time at the Grand Canyon, and even flown across in a helicopter, and this great film, shot in IMAX is as close as you can get without getting wet to a real experience. Much better in 3D.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter, 3, and I love playing this game together. It really is fun for adults and children.  I Would recommend this app to anyone.
1476727651|5.0|There are many great reviews already posted here, so I'll add my &#34;to the point&#34; two cents: If you are a Constant Reader, just quit reading reviews and buy the book. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />For everyone else:<br /><br />It's scary. Seriously, it's terrifying at times. I will be 40 this month, and have read all of King's work. This book has you cocking your head to the side as you try to sleep at night, just knowing you heard something, or someone, standing over your bed in the dark.<br /><br />Fantastic characterization; you will feel truly, emotionally connected to the characters in this book.<br /><br />The story itself is just written with perfect pace, and, to me, there are no pointless meanderings or unnecessary pages. The story just flows.<br /><br />King's writing just gets better and better.
B009V3KKXY|4.0|This is a good book, if you didn't already know most of these knots can be found on the authors YouTube Channel. The pictures can be difficult to follow on some of the more complex knots but it's a nice reference book if you're getting into the hobby of making paracord knots. I'd avoid the eBook and purchase the paperback. The ebook is poorly formatted and will leave you more confused than before you started.
1616550414|5.0|Great book for having in the living room, or just for yourself. It contains all the history, all the characters, everything you knew and you didn't know.<br /><br />It explains each and every game of the fanchise and also they make you discover the sequence of the games. And as always, you won't find a better prince in other place, so buy it with Amazon ;)
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Just read it.  Fun book....suspenseful.  Along the lines of Gone Girl and maybe better written.  Great fun! Here are three more words.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|Works as expected. I would have been surprised and indeed disappointed if this cable had not done what was advertised.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game let's you customize your character and the game play is similar to Elder Scrolls. The world is very big, lots of things to explore. I really like it.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Great video, a real feast for the eyes<br />!highly recommend for those who enjoy fine cinema<br />Action and fun adventure
B006C45LHA|4.0|A little beyond the realm of reality but like all good westerns, the good guys vanquished the enemy who came to destroy them.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Don't watch much TV during the week due to heavy workload but love the fact that I can, on a quiet weekend,  &#34;stream download&#34; a Season of some of my shows.  The Good Wife is one of my favorites,  Love the actors, plot seems to move along quickly and leaves you at the end of the show looking forward to the next episode.<br /><br />I like the fact that each episode has a plot within a plot and the pace of the show moves quickly. Sometimes each episode has a &#34;case&#34; which gives you new characters to deal with and also gives you an definite conclusion to what happens to that &#34;case&#34; and its outcome.
1400082773|5.0|Beautifully written. Excellent book. I was disappointed that all of the original book was not reprinted which would have included his speech.
B005LAIII0|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, and the quality of the Blu-ray was great. Glad to save and buy it through Amazon - always a good option!
B009RH9FR6|4.0|This case is really nice. Besides protecting my Kindle it also  allows me to prop up the screen for hands free viewing.
B00FEAZGDC|5.0|I say that because I am pretty sure that this is a movie mostly ignored by young people.  How else can one explain that I never heard about it until it was out in a box on a shelf at the local Target store?  There it was and I did not know this movie, never read about it, heard not a word about it.  My wife and I went home, called a couple of other old people, and streamed it.  We all loved it.  The actors, the story, the tears, the laughter, the sentiment:  all just fine.  When it comes out on Blu ray, I will purchase it.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|This cd is very well done.  I enjoy listening to it.  If you like Michael's other stuff and like Christmas music, you will really enjoy this cd.
B00D6BN9NK|2.0|I like Bruce Willis.  I like the character he plays in the &#34;Die Hard&#34; films.  But he should have quit after the first two.  I am sure he continues to make money from them, but how sad.  This is a dumb movie.  The car chase at the beginning goes on and on and on, and one knows that lots of people are being killed, innocent people, but we are asked to ignore that because it is exciting.  In truth, this car chase is not even exciting.  Like the rest of the film, it is just dumb.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|This one was a bit less superhero &#34;pure fantasy&#34; than the others have been. Contained more run of the mill visceral violence. Still, enjoyed it immensely. Downey is amazing, Gwyneth is her usual gorgeous self, and Don  Cheadle is one of the best. Totally fun (and intense at times).
B008Y212PI|5.0|Very fun and interesting puzzle game to keep my brain occupied. Having trouble just playing one board before putting it down. Gotta play a few in a row. Playing the 10x10 grids and they're challenging. Can't wait to finish them and hit the 15x15 grids..
B00BY7NK96|4.0|I found the first chapters held my attention more than the latter ones which tended to focus on what needs to be done  - rather than the focus on the author's personal experience covered in the earlier part of the book.<br />I would recommend it to any career focussed woman who has so many other things in her life to juggle - frequently with little understanding from others.
B000OVLINI|4.0|A friend was reading a later book by Zafon, but I read some reviews, and most said that book wasn't as good as &#34;The Shadow of the Wind&#34; so I thought I would read this first.  It's good, the plot moves along, the characters are well-defined, consistent within themselves, and interesting.  The conflicts are compelling and there is an air of mystery that draws me in.  Zafon is an interesting writer, and occasionally comes up with an original image.  (At one point, he refers to &#34;the perpetual grin&#34; of a piano.)<br /><br />Still, I wouldn't call this a great novel.  I wouldn't even say &#34;I can't put it down.&#34;  At this writing, I'm only about half-way through the book, so it could always move me by the ending.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The clarity was fantastic seeing it on blue ray. If you love the Sout of Music, you should get this one. The book and the real story was great to read.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I  love 'Game of Thrones' and the ease with which I was able to pick up my purchase at the 'lockers' was fantastic. Now I don't have to worry about purchases being stolen in my apartment building.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I got this item because my Kindle cord would not plug in.<br />I found another cord at my house, so I use this one for my cell phone.
1575666286|5.0|Great info for any one who wants to be healthy through natural ways, should read this book and use this therapy. It's somewhat time consuming at first but it is worthwhile.<br />I love this book and totally recommend it!
B000VX0416|5.0|the shoe is just classic, it's fantastic.<br />there's not doubt that people should have it, and it fits in many kinds of occasions
B004742Y68|3.0|Classic horror and mystery.  This is the best of the series and iconic as a movie making event.  &#34;They're Here...&#34; is a part of our culture.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great little game I enjoyed playing while I was killing time around the house while prepping and cooking supper thanks
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is one of the best thrillers I have read lately, I couldn't put it down. Great story !
B0000C3I6U|5.0|Must say a very informative documentary it has made me look at the sport in a different way. If your looking for some inspiration I would recommend you to watch it.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|It was interesting reading about grown up Danny Torrence. This was a &#34;keep on reading cause I have to find out howitzer ends&#34; book.
B0087ITBT8|5.0|Barbra has a major role in this movie as the mother of Seth's character. Her acting is very good, the story is sensitive and interesting. This was inspired by real life events in the life of the guy who wrote the script, who actually traveled cross country with his mom. He is a very talented person who has done some great work in Disney films.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I love cats, but Bob is truly amazing!! It is a heart warming journey for James & Bob  which ends on a haapy note!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is awesome!  I love Downton Abbey'a unique plot twists and subtle innuendos.  The casting is amazing and it feels like the early 19th Century.
B001F6ZIXW|2.0|Intriguing show but hard to buy in to!  Story lines are very soap opera like.  Good for 16 year old people
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Kind of a role switch on the WoK story. Well told. Little overuse of lens flares and barcode scanners as props though
1465012796|5.0|It's perfect for Swifties like me, the photos in the calendar are stunning and the quality of the print is good (High-Resolution). It is slightly different than the calendar found on the official Taylor Swift Store currently for those wondering, Cover photo is awesome. The photos from both calendars mostly similar to those found in the RED photobook,coming from the RED photoshoot . This has a more edgy, modern design though. Great way to keep schedule of things. This would make a good Gift for Taylor Swift fans .
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A good choice for anyone willing to have their heart broken. This is a book about falling in love, among other things. I fell in love quickly and easily with the well-drawn characters. It ended in the usual way that love, true love, ends.
B0063T7JGU|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE....one of my favorites!!! I have been waiting for a very long time for them to put this on amazon instant video....hurry up already!!!!
B008Y212PI|4.0|start off easy with 5x5 & work up to 15x15! keeps the brain busy & stimualated. adictive. downside: can't put it down.
1451673442|5.0|Amazing I recommend to everyone because it will completely impact your life for the better and make you a more positive person.
B008PPUMVY|5.0|I love songs that tell stories and Frank Zappa always told the best stories with very beautiful music.  Let The Central Scrutinizer take you on this magical journey.  You won't regret it.  You will better for it.  RIP, Frank Zappa.  I miss you.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Love the app keeps me busy while waiting somewhere I would recommend this for waiting at the dmv or other government office.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|It has been a while since I have read a novel that I literally stayed up late in order to find out what happens next.  This was the one I could not put down, I actually read before work so I could find out a little more.  It is packed with action, suspense, intrigue and I could not wait to read the next one.
B00EM764ZC|1.0|The maps are slow to explore and rigid I personally don't like this app maybe better for others.<br />I'm not giving this any higher ratings.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Marc Anthony is just AMAZING! God gave him such a special gift. He has so much passion in his voice I can feel every word radiate through my body. I just LOVE him!!
B009NH6JRE|4.0|Im a fan of this series and have the the other seasons on DVD so I got this one too. I had seen all the episodes so I knew what to expect. But I was disappointed in the extras or should I say lack thereof.<br /><br />There were only a handful of deleted scenes none very lengthy and several that were alluded to in interviews were not included. THe featurettes were nothing we hadnt seen before and again there were only a few.<br /><br />I had particularly hoped they would include Cold Storage the webisode series with Josh Stewart but for some reason they didnt and that was a big disappointment.<br /><br />If youre a fan of the series but already have it on a DVR or similar device there is no really  compelling reason to buy it on DVD.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khalid  Husseini has a gentle touch with human emotions, his characters are very believable and interesting, I look out for his books and enjoy reading them
B007PBKG5G|3.0|but not one that I go back to very often.  I love the classic blues sound, but it lacks the emotion of the original stuff it is trying emulate.  I thought I would be blown away, but I am more like, this is cool.  Maybe I need to give it a few more listens to get me into it.  I am looking foward to their sophmore attempt to see where they take the sound.
B009AMANBA|4.0|I liked this movie-what I did'nt like was the lighting in a lot of the scenes.It was as if they were trying to effect a mood to the viewer as if you were right there in the room where the scene was being shot.Over all I liked this movie.Daniel Day Lewis is an exceptional actor as is Tommy Lee Jones.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I do wish there was more instruction in how to achieve the state she is referring to. But, all in all, it is a great read and an amazing journey!

B0036S4B6M|5.0|After burning through the entire series of Orange in the New Black, I needed more.  Although the book is really NOTHNG at all like the series, it really stands on its own merits and obviously was the jumping off point for the series which creates many more plot lines.  This book highlights the insanity of the judicial system without being preachy.  There are many people in jail who are their due to the color of their skin and a little bit of weed in their pockets.  After years of incarceration where do these woman go upon release? They have nothing.  LIttle training and no reintroduction into the real world.  Being white with access to some money may not change everything, but it sure does not hurt.<br /> the book is funny, entertaining enlighting and thought provoking--- I would read it again.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|This was not necessarily totally new material (we've seen tons of kidnapping movies, including with determined fathers and even movies with sex trafficking as the reason for the kidnapping.)<br /><br />I think what made this good was:<br />1) Liam Neeson...perfect role for him.  He's such a dapper, international man.  The obvious plastic surgery is bothersome, but he is forever a 6'4\\" hunk and hero.<br />2) All the smart little ways he was always tricking the bad guys and getting what he needed.<br />3) Paris.<br /><br />The daughter was an annoying, spoiled brat and the ex-wife was an ice queen.  Ick to them both.  Honestly, were it not for Neeson, this would be much less of a ride.<br /><br />I would not buy it, but by all means it's worth a rent.
B008469DGY|4.0|Well gosh, this game sure was super fun. A # 1 good time. I will play it long time. Hooray for this game and all who are privileged enough to play it. Ok?
B00881VLCE|5.0|Enjoy doing puzzles.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|That game is amazing it is the best it feels like I'm really there like I'm really in the game I'm Scarlet Fox.
B0031RS8SA|5.0|I ws hooked form the 1st page.  I have recommended this book to many people as not only was it unputdownable, but it gave a rare insight into another culture.  Brilliantly written
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Very well-written, poignant and an excellent insight not only into living in jail but also how unconscious behavior affects your life and the lives of everyone around you. I felt for Piper and understood how she could have gotten into her dangerous life after college.<br />The first night I started reading this I couldn't sleep. Start this during the day! :-)
B00280LYIM|5.0|I LOVE IT so interesting the mystery is played out so well very good description  and very exotic adventures AWESOME
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun. Endless amounts of fun. Sort of like temple run but better.lots of stuff to.choose from.and money isn't really necessary. Thumbs up!
B00BV0FK58|5.0|It is a great book. It gave me great insight on things I never thought was a big deal<br />I would recommend it for everybody
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Just love everything Blake does, he gets it!  His lyrics touch my soul.  He never sounds the same on every sound which I love, very talented.
B00FFVML74|5.0|Once again BBC America has got a winner on their hands.  Broadchurch is such a great show.  The acting is top notch and it will keep you guessing until the end.  Won't give it away but it's about cops investigating a young boys death...  So if your looking for a great show from start to finish, look no further.  Broadchurch is a real winner!
B00CHI5F5S|4.0|Sean Penn as Meyer Lansky was terrific.  Josh Brolin wasn't exactly Robert Stack's Elliott Ness from the Untouchables television series...he was much tougher.  Good story...lots of violence...worth a look see.
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie brought a lot of things to the surface in our marriage, resulting in  some talking that we had not done in a long time,  I thought the movie was a good movie and did enjoy watching it at home.
B006BQM762|4.0|Enjoyable sci-fi movie that the whole family would enjoy. The adults weren't jerks and the kids weren't brats so there is something to be said about that.  The story was more about kid friendships and the strong bond they had between themselves.  This was the second time watching this movie and I'd watch it again in the future.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game is tons of fun!!!! I really like the interesting levels and interactivity of the game. Challenging yet fun!
B006QLH7O4|5.0|This was my 1st 3D purchase and i was very happy with it , audio and video quality was excellent and plenty of 3D effects
B008Y212PI|4.0|Fun game that is a good challenge on the 15x15 panels.  Would recommend to anyone who likes nonogram type games.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I really like this game, because  it's just flat out silly and some of the answers make me laugh. And some of the really hard ones, once I figure it out, it's like &quot;uh duh!&quot;
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|A beautiful story, beautifully told.  Very sad, I hoped for more of a reunion than there was...but poignant all the same.
B003Y5HWJU|2.0|Absolutely the worse audio editing I have ever heard. The volume would constantly vary from very low (unhearable) to normal levels to very loud. BAD
B008KGPEQG|2.0|i spected more, i start reading it one of the radio host from argentina recommended, after a radio interview with a book shop, but didn't get muy full satisfaction
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The Avengers was action packed and fun from beginning to end.  The special effects were pretty great too.  We can't wait for the sequel.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Very intriguing sci fi series. Great intertwining of a story within a story that lets each episode stand alone within the greater context. Like the interjection of possibilities for another parallel universe.
B000002WU9|5.0|This is the best Wu solo effort in my opinion even though it could be considered a group album with Ghost & Rae. RZA production is fire.
055358202X|5.0|I have enjoyed all the books in the series. Now i cant wait to get Dance with Dragons, the suspence is killing me!
B000THKAR2|5.0|Great music.  Iconic band.  If you are a fan of punk, or speed metal, you need to own this album.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Kept me interested all the way through.  The tv series is very true to the book.  Very satisfied with this purchase.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is thought provoking.  I am glad I picked it up.  Once in awhile you come across a gem.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Love, love, LOVE!! Amazingly well played & continually captivating. Beautiful acting, attire, scenery, story...generally wonderful. Much like a 'Pride & Prejudice' which is a welcome change from the normal shows on now.

B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Takes the best from other and makes some great extras. Well done job and keeps you entertained for a long time.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story is well written and full of surprises.  I especially loved the way the author presented so much information and \\"what ifs\\" in the epilogue.  I loved this book so much that I immediately downloaded 2 more books by this author.
B003NX75B8|4.0|I enjoy this author very much. This is a story about two boys who have the same name but not the same lives. Well written, I enjoyed it.
B00ENYCQX8|1.0|I didn't have luck with it at all and deleted it off of my Kindle and out of my cloud.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|MaMakes the kindle charge like new. the old charger would not work but this one does.<br />thanks<br />why does Amazon require such long feedback?kes the kindle charge like new.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|My granddaughter and I chose to read this for our &#34;together&#34; summer read.  Lots of who-done-it clues and richly woven personalities combined to make this a fun, classic read.  I kept going back and forth over the clues to see if I could figure out the suspect before the book's surprise ending.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It was exiting and kept me on my toes! It was so awesome! Can't wait to read the next one. Props to ally condie
B00DYWKPAQ|2.0|Gone the way of Pearl Jam, KOL has become an adult contemporary rock group. This album lumbers through what feels like leftovers from their two earlier records and is plainly too safe to be considered worthwhile.
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|I just watched 20 minutes into the movie, too violent and bloody. At least Rob Schneider and Sylvester Stallone made the previous version funny.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|It came within when it said it would and it such a great deal! Hopefully next time I need film will be before these sell out!!
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I guess i have watched The Walking Dead for too long. This was a good change of pace for a zombie movie.
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|The first Abrams new Star Trek was really fine.  I've watched it several times and don't get tired of it.  But all the writers and everyone involved ought to have known that Captain Pike, with the help of Spock, went to live on Talos IV in the first season.  I am offended that they would have Christopher Pike in this film as if season one never happened.<br />Furthermore, I am a great fan of Cumberbatch.  I was excited to know he'd been cast in this visual effects spectacle but alas visual effects were more important to the producers than concentration on historic detail and creation of new and vital characters.  More should have been done for Benedict.
B00E0G5U4G|5.0|This is such a fantastic release for an old school metal head like myself. The production, the riffs, the vocals, the DRUMS (new drummer is incredible). And 40-something Jeff still sounds like 20-something Jeff!  His lyrics constantly have me referencing Wikipedia to decipher what the hell he's talking about, so I'm learning something, too :)
B00DI75SWM|2.0|I like being able to make my own &#34;Keep Calm&#34; signs, but the app keeps crashing on my Kindle. I've made about ten signs, only to lose each one when the app crashes.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Excellent book, very well written, takes nothing away from women who choose to not lean in. It offers great research and opinions from many successful women. Two thumbs up.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I got this quicker than I had expected to get it. I looked all over my city for this CD and it was no where to be found. Can always depend on Amazon and then to get excellent customer service on top of that. I will only use Amazon for these type purchases in the future.
B00F91H15W|3.0|At its worst: Boring. The crime itself was boring, and so was this movie. Wait for it to be free, definitely not worth $4.<br />At its best: A commentary on how messed up these kids can be, with very few comments - just a few subtle scenes or lines that are poignant.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This show on DVD is simply going to be a classic!  Well done on every level and worth every penny spent.  First seen on PBS I wanted to purchase this show, and I'm not one to see a movie more than once because there are so many more movies yet to see!  It's food to the senses....
B00F36ZHHC|1.0|Tried to run then deleted shortly afterwards.  Doesn't work on Kindle Fire HD 7.  Good thing it was free.  Maybe one day they'll improve it enough so it actually works properly, then I might try it again.
0440241901|5.0|Her books are fabulous. They r page turners and they are full of humor. They make you laugh and at times you can see<br />Yourself in these books.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Set in a sci fi dystopia, Brandon Sanderson keeps you guessing with frequent plot twists. I'm always impressed with authors whose books don't fall into a predictable pattern. Sanderson delivers on that once again.
B00B5D32XS|5.0|I just finished watching this horror series and must say it is one of the best horror series I have ever seen. It is not just horror but also drama that will draw you in. I could not stop watching and stayed up to 4am. The character were very real and the surprises around the corner you will never see them coming. This horror has made me laugh, cry, relate to the characters Except the Bloody Face Murder and that crazy doctor. All in all I wish I could rate this series a ten no button for this If you watch this series you wont be disappointed unlike some horrors that are predictable this ones not.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|This short story is more or less about everyone's life on this planet, as it reviews some common existential problems of a modern-day person, who wants to achieve something big, to become somebody and enjoy the 'cheers' of others. Apparently, the protagonist, has got a certain talent, but somehow does not quite manage to develop his full potential; or possibly - he is never in the right time, in the right place, and never makes the right choices. Whether the latter is accidental, we should judge for ourselves somehow. The reasons behind this sad storyline are presented in a rather humorous and amusing way.<br />The plot is very natural, though with sufficient unexpected twists and surprises, together with a pinch of black irony. The style is really superb and enjoyable. Characters are quite realistic and oftentimes, allegedly, refer to real-life celebrities and events, without actually incurring any insult or overdone parody.<br />In essence, the moral of this narrative is nicely interwoven into the plot, so that the reader could arrive at it without any additional 'push'. The author definitely implies some interconnectedness between humans, their talents, relationships, value systems and sacrifices on the way to success. The key word here is perhaps success, but at what cost? Are we prepared to bear the cost indeed? Whatever the cost?<br />On the other hand, what are our priorities: family, career, friendship, success, fame? Could we always find the right balance between all those goals?<br />In a way, it is a 'soul-searching' exercise, both from a Shakespearean perspective and a 21st-century viewpoint. Nevertheless, one thing is for sure, whoever is not afraid of being sincere with themselves and wants to be a better person or more successful professional in the long-run, should read this great literary work.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I work night shift and this really helps me to relax and get the sleep I need during the day!  I would recommend this to anyone who has a difficult time falling asleep! love the sounds of rain!!!!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It was a little long winded and did not caputre my attention in the same way as &#34;the kite runner&#34; - less raw - more tamed down but still a fabulous story
B003O86FMW|4.0|Easy reading. Nice even pace and did not drag even when needing to give background information. Good ending and I want to finish the series.
B000VI12ZS|4.0|Good movie. Action was good and very gruesomely realistic. Plot could have been better developed but overall it is quite captivating. Instead of showing just the good side of story it has good depiction of racism and abuse that these Nojavo people faced in the military.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Challenging and lots of fun! I wish more of my favorite facebook games were compatible w/ my Kindle Fire. This is also holiday-appropriate!
B00B3EVNEE|5.0|I love what Robin has done with the older, &#34;root&#34; type tunes - bringing his creative, distinctive flavor to them!  He treats the roots of blues with respect, yet has a necessary disregard for convention as he shreds!!!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really like this App!  I was able to download my favorite songs to use to wake me up!!  I put this on my Kindle.
B0015FWRHS|5.0|For musicians, amazing work on piano, bass and drums. For music lovers, wonderful aching melodies with great amounts of rests/silence as well as uptempo pieces. If you have interest in Avishai Cohen, this is the best work I've heard to date.
B008Y768XO|5.0|This was a touching movie about a man and a loving dog.<br />I would watch this again.<br />Take time to view this tender movie.<br />True story.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|This is a phone version of the old hand held versions of rolling a tiny ball around in a puzzle to get to the end.  It is good for just sitting and letting your mind be distracted.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is loads of fun, I play it all the time.  Graphics and sounds are top-notch and the layout is visually pleasing.  Do not have to be connected to the internet to play which is important to me because I work in a place that is underground and I like playing this game at lunch.  Highly recommend!!!!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|The book had me hooked from the start but the further I got, the less hooked I was.  I will read the rest in the series because I'm curious where the story will go.  Also, a very unusual twist at the end...  Definitely wasn't expecting that.
0452295548|5.0|She amazed me that she was able to overcome all obstacles of a stroke!  My daughter died from a stroke!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie is for adults only due to the language in it. I choose the rating on it as I love it because it has a new twist to the myth of UFO and space aliens. Paul is a cute loveable alien who just wants to get back home. In the process of getting home he meets two lucky guys who become Paul's friends. If you like UFO movie this one is super dooper great.
B00447L4JG|5.0|Was a gift for my daughter for Christmas, had been looking all over for this movie. She loves it, it was a great price. Arrived quickly!
B004EPYZPS|4.0|I like this movie even though it's a little hard to follow in the begining. Towards the middle of the movie it become interesting. You need to pay attention to all of the events that are going to understand what the movie is about. I recommend this movie to those who have an abstract mind. It makes you think about life from another demension and sometimes how cruel we can be with life from another planet.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I think this could be an accurate description of what goes on between the family of children who kill. I didn't think it was overly dramatic, and that's what makes it all the more scary. Swinton was great. I didn't know how she'd pair up w/Reilly, but they worked. The boy was very convincing and disturbing.
6304806434|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who love action all the way throughout the move. All of the actors are great in this movie. As I stated it's bad to the bone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely fell in love with the show! The characters and their roles are outstanding. Each individuals performance makes me feel as if i am right there next to them.
B000002VSN|5.0|I love this CD and all that Whitney did, throughout his career in music around the mundol!! I listen to this CD every night!!!! Whitney is simply the biggest and best artist of all time!! I love Whitney, forever!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Good game, it help pass the time, and very much like the movie. I will update it at  a later date.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|I love this movie and all that Whitney did in his entire career in music from around the world!! I've watched, this film, more than thirty times!! I just love this movie!! Whitney is simply the biggest and best artist of all time!! I love Whitney, forever!!
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|This is an acceptable way to access LinkedIn.  Easy to use and navigate.  Not quite as inclusive as accessing online.
B000002VMD|5.0|I love this CD and all that Whitney did, throughout his career in music around the mundol!! Whitney is simply the biggest and best artist of all time!! I love Whitney, forever!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you want to read soft porn with little or no plot then this piece of crud is for you.  Were I a woman, I would be deeply offended by this trash.  The air headed virgin lets herself be beaten and degraded and BEGS  to be screwed by the man in the picture who is a 100 per cent psychopath. ( To be fair I stopped reading it about 70 per cent of the way through so badly did it suck; no pun intended )
B0063M22QO|5.0|Great colors. Easy flowing. Fun game. Worth paying 99cents. Easy to move tiles around and super fun. Love it on my kindle.
B000002LAC|5.0|I give it 5 stars! Awesome Cd! Country Music greatest female legends of all time! A must Buy! Great Christmas Gift😊
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|A good read although it did take me a little bit to get into it in the beginning but this is not my typical book of choice being a huge vampire or romance novel fan. Overall, I enjoyed this book and am definitely going to be reading the next one in the series now that the foundation is set. Such an interesting concept and I loved the idea of telling this intriguing story about these Shadow-hunters. Anything that has a bit of mystery to it, action and of course a forbidden love story captures my attention! To be quite honest, I didn't know about the books until I saw the movie which of course is quite backwards (I know) but it's better late than never. One of the things I enjoyed most is the fact that even though it is fiction, the world that the author created is believable and the characters are easy to connect to. If you can't feel the emotion yourself or connect to the characters in a book then you really have nothing, but Clare made it so easy to do. After reading some of the reviews I noticed that there are a lot of comparisons to other books but any book like this that comes out, will always be compared to Twilight, Harry Potter etc. That is to be expected as they set the stage, but I recognize it for the unique work that it is and look forward to what comes next for Clary.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|The first book I read on my ipad and this just made me feel proud to own an apple product.. I just love the kind of creativity and efforts which ever put in to get so many elegantly designed products out into this world...<br /><br />INSPIRING!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I finished the trilogy awhile back and just now got around to reviewing it but there were, of course, things that I LOVED about the book (which surprised me because Erotic Romance/BSDM novels are new to me) and there were things that I didn't like as much. Honestly, I probably wouldn't have picked it up and finished the series if it hadn't been for all of the hype that surrounded it but I did, and I don't regret it because it was different. It was a guilty pleasure that I indulged in just as thousands of other readers (mainly female) did. The idea, the plot: The successful billionaire with a dark past and a young college graduate, is probably what kept me engaged and reading and I liked where the series went. I did enjoy the twisted romance between Christian and Ana although if I am to be honest, by the second and third books I did start to skip through sex scenes now and again because they seemed to repeat themselves. I also found some of Ana's thoughts to be a little immature for an adult but then again, I get that she was supposed to be an awkward character which worked well for the story. Oh, I did love Christian though, like so many other women who read it! Interesting character and it was even easier to love him when I pictured him being played by Ian Somerhalder. ;)<br /><br />I hate to say this because I did enjoy breezing through the trilogy, but if I'm to give an honest review here I have to say that it had very poor literary qualities and needed more editing. I can't rate it any higher than three stars, even though I did enjoy it, because of that fact alone. There really isn't a style of writing or a genre that I can't get into when it comes to books, but when they are written poorly that can be a deal breaker for any reader. There are two things that make a book something that people want to buy and read: a good cover and readability (good writing/editing). There are so many people that I personally know who really did love the trilogy but all agreed that it wasn't written well, especially in comparison to other Erotic Romance Novel Series like The Crossfire Novels by Sylvia Day. I finished all three of those in four days! Anyway, it is what is. You take the good and the bad when it comes to this series by James or you just don't read it, but I'm glad I checked it out and have found another series I enjoyed because of it.
B0027DJ87O|5.0|I gave this collection 5 stars because, though there may be better studio recordings of her work, this represents Alanis at her very best: performing songs that flex her vocal and songwriting abilities. The instruments were superiorly micd and the sounds were mixed wonderfully in post performance to give the songs a studio quality while holding on to the organic live sound.<br /><br />I must confess that I am not her biggest fan. However, this collection won me over and remains among my favorites.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|Great. Allows the everyday man or women to shout out to the world their immense love and/or hatred. Moral outrage captured in prose. OR, ignorant blathering spouted from the minds of dolts. A flat playing field for diverse opinions. It would only be better if it came with fries ( therefore not 5star).
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was recommended reading by an uncle interested in the sciences and technology.<br />Rebecca Skloot told an excellent story and followed by answering all of my questions the post narrative.<br />This must is a must read for anyone  capable of understanding it's content.
B00594XOZU|1.0|It takes too Damn long just to log in. I've Been waiting 2weeks to see if It works, it doesn't. This app need to be fix. Imma just delete this app wait an extra 2weeks till it work.<br />I RECOMMEND DO NOT GET THIS APP UNTIL THE ERRORS ARE FIXED.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This product was perfect, they didn't lie to me or fool me like other places. Deserves all stars to me.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played. The game consists of all the best songs  and melodies from all different years  and the game makes you feel like you are actually playing the piano by yourself I think that merry Christmas is the best song and  the easiest to. Have fun .
B003Y5H574|4.0|For new movies, I wonder to myself, should I review the movie or the DVD? This movie isn't all that new, but I hadn't seen it and the price was terrific, so I splurged. I loved the movie. The DVD seemed good quality to me. There were some extras that were funny. Seriously, who doesn't love a few extra minutes of Ryan Gosling, lol!
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|These new movies in the Star Trek continuing saga, continue to be worth watching and showing to the younger generation who have not had the opportunity to see these programs as the older generation has been able to do. Even though friends have stated after watching &#34;Star Trek Into Darkness&#34;, it was like watching a rebroadcast of &#34;the sixties show&#34; with a new twist. As I watched this movie, I found that even though having seen all as a trekkie, it was worth watching, especially for the new twist.
0670023329|4.0|Do you think you understand what is going on in North Korea? Because if you don't read this book, you don't know. The story this young man tells is shocking and horrifying and terrifying and enlightening. I'm not going to retell his story in my own words. You have to read the book. In fact, no summary of the book will be sufficient. To grasp the horror of what is happening to people right now as we sit at our computers so safe and secure is unnerving. Then there is the insight you gain into who these people stay in power and how they destroy the spirit of people. And it makes you think of every tyrant and every prison camp.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very entertaining!  Enjoyed all the various super heros as we'll as the bad guys!  We'll done and one to add to the collection.
B006Z00R1Q|3.0|This seemed very repetitive and not particularly scary most of the time. I remember the original Paranormal Activity to be much much scarier. Perhaps we just know too much about what to expect now? My wife got bored enough to fall sleep which watching this one. :)
B00338QENI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It was such an interesting subject and well written.  A very controversial subject with no good answers.
8866137960|5.0|This little Hobbit Moleskine accompanied me on my own unexpected adventure. It fit right in my purse. It's perfect. I love it!
B008J34466|5.0|Pink out did herself on this collection of songs.  I didn't find a bad one in the bunch.  She is such a versatile singer and I love that she speaks her mind no matter what.  Beam Me Up really made me cry the 1st time I heard it and Great Escape was one of my favorites.  Buy it and enjoy it for yourself!!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|A terrifically talented cast. especially the two lead characters, brings poignancy and compelling drama to this series. I adored it.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|It's a fun tower defense game both my niece and I enjoy. Enough difficulty to keep it interesting with enough options to create wins so as not to become hopeless.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Fantastic acting, and great story lines.  Key to a successful show! Capt Picard one of the best. The best of the Star Trek series
B00915G6MG|5.0|Original, genuine, new series DVD sealed in original package.  Great show - happy to have this season to keep in perpetuity
B009UX2YAC|4.0|she loves the fast pace and the different features of the game.  It's a lot like Temple Run, but with more modern/urban themes and scenery...
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Acting is excellent as is the writing combined with the colors and costumes....superb.<br />The actors seem to be in the moments they present on screen plus I love history....more. more, more<br />Whatever happened to King and Reign?<br />Show also kept me sane while I was at my daughter's house with the flu for a week........
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I recently upgraded my MacBook Air, and of course, Apple had changed the power cable port. I have a dozen of the original MagSafe power cables, and for about $10 each upgraded them using this converter, rather than buying much more expensive new MagSafe 2 power cables. It makes me wonder why Apple changed the MagSafe to begin with.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|i love this app! it will wake me up for school! no other alarm does that!!it is really helpful when i wake up!
0671449028|3.0|Not worth the raves from other readers.  Not sure about the appeal.  Just OK and not a favorite for my daughter and me.
B0084AXZK0|1.0|I admit up front that I did not finish this book; in fact, I got very tired of it about 35% of the way through it. I had never read Oscar Wilde and wanted the experience. I don't know if this novel is indicative of his style, but I found it extremely wordy but very shallow. It seemed to me that he was attempting to be a noble philosopher through his characters, but they seemed shallow and uninteresting. I cannot recommend this book. I would have hated studying it in my long-ago college English literature classes.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Being in a rural area we need this app. It's great! Videos. Maps.Temps. Oh my! And more than one location is wonderful.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I tend to watch the trailer before I watch the movie to get an idea. For some strangest reason the trailer does not reveal that this THING is actually zombies. It is not obvious from the scenes. I am not a big zombie fan movie an actually probably would pass altogether if I knew it was zombie.<br /><br />The movie was decent. Brad was good, doing his Brad thing as he always does. Nothing breathtaking but you can seat through if you can sit through any zombie movie.<br /><br />It has some relevance to possible pandemic situation and it is interesting to watch<br />the scenario but then again zombies.. hmm.. you either like them or not.<br /><br />The sounds as many staed before is way off. You will have to hold to your remote<br />and either turn it up or down all the time. I have put CC to read text but it was so tinny<br />I would need magni to read it.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|I didn't particularly care for the original and thought I'd give the remake a try.  I shouldn't have bothered.  Overall lame.
B00CHVIPP2|3.0|The movie itself is pretty good. My 7year old wasn't a fan but she is at the age between cute cartoons amd wanting to understand adult humor.... so that's understandable. This particular combo pack was exciting at first because it came with \\"belt\\" the toy animal... but the case that held everything was horrible and flimsy. It is so thin and it is suppose to hold a dvd and a blu-ray? The first combo pack... I opened it and the cae has popped open-it wasn't taped shut like a normal movie case...  the blu-ray was cracked. I returned it and exchanged it for a different one. I opened the second one and again... the case was open but at least the discs were okay. I ordered a set of new cases off Amazon to fix the problem. Basically don't but this combo pack unless you want to buy a new case... just buy the regular combo pack without the toy.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|This is like real you tube compared to my kindle fire, but my kindle is 5x faster it's super slow so don't get it, it is a waist of a download. Please please please please please please don't get this app
B0087GZ8YW|2.0|As always Rankin writes a good yarn but this time because Rebus has retired from active service it seems to have lost something . The ending was also a bit drawn out . However I will continue to buy and read any bew novels from his pen,
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game gets me thinking. Using patterns and numbers to find keys and put clues together. I love it. The decoration of the rooms are nice and realistic styling.
B00FEN000S|5.0|...comes a great exo-skeleton! Why this movie wasn't as popular as any other action packed, apocalyptic but human bonding inspired against a common enemy oh I wonder whose going to die movie is beyond me. Thoroughly enjoyed it. If only they had a Jaeger with a tail....now that would have potentially been an awesome weapon...or recruited Godzilla. If you primarily talk to yourself and not others, then this movie might not be for you.
B00867HDTA|1.0|For whatever reason I can never find any of these apps in order to download, this is about the 3rd time I get one of this wasting time items and never works.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|I really enjoy the twists and turns this show takes and how Mike Ross is slowly bringing Harvey around to a little more of the personality he used to be. I like flashbacks, too!
B002M9WW30|5.0|I ordered this as a Christmas gift for my husband and father. It was shipped very quickly and I did not notice any issues with the packaging that would indicate damage. It is very compact for a boxed set, which to me is nice.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Great book loved it good plot and now I have to put in 9more words in order to submit this so us.
030759565X|5.0|My sister loves the smitten kitchen blog and had been eyeing this for a while. I got it for her for Christmas and she was very happy with it. It is a heavy book, so keep that in mind if you are going to be shipping it anywhere yourself as a gift - it may be easier and cheaper to ship it from amazon.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Very enjoyable read. I learned a lot about Billy Beane and his Oakland methods. Now I will see the movie.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|In this time consuming soul draining excuse for a game you click on objects to get in game currency and wait forever for them to be ready for you to click on them again.  It took me over a year, possibly two, to get to the end.  There is no special ending or video that's played when you complete everything just a &#34;yay it's done&#34; sort of thing.<br /><br />In order to finish the game you have to utilize the social network aspect.  Both of my devices worked fine on the internet, but the app refused to connect most of the time.  Despite the three updates, Gameloft has failed to fix this bug.<br /><br />No matter how much of an MLP fan you are, stay away from this monstrosity.  In the time it would take you to finish this game without hacking it or spending real money, you could learn to draw in the MLP style, learn to program, and make a game 400 times better than this one.
1885167776|5.0|I am a new realtor and this book was better that described.  It makes it so simple!  The Real Estate Industry as I am learning has many parts to it which can be over whelming.  The One thing explains so easily how to take charge of any goal or task One Thing as a time.  I will keep this handy on my desk for inspiration and guidance.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I purchased 2 of the dvd sets for both of my daughters.  We watched GG together, and we love having the dvds so we can have our own marathons when the mood strikes.
B0019IB0II|5.0|Brilliant and extraordinarily interesting book..!!<br />Definitely one of the best books ever: enticing, engaging, informative, sensitive..!!<br />An absolute 'must read'...!!!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I do like it and I like the challenge, It works great and is fun when you success.  I do like it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've struggled with my weight for years and I have never been able to stick with a DVD workout program. JM30DS has kept me accountable, pushed me to my limits, and help me to lose 10 lbs so far! She's awesome! This DVD has a great system that really eases you into the workouts as the intensity increases! Jillian has such a way of motivating you through the television screen. If you're struggling - BUY THIS! It's a great way to get started :)
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|It is not easy to figure out how it works.  I find it hard to work and figure out, so I will keep trying.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|I don't think there is much I have to say. It's a classic forever with such a great cast. Sure it's an 80's movie, but everyone loves it!!
B0000AUHQT|5.0|With the new movie of the great Gatsby, played by Leonardo Caprio, I thought it would be great to watch this version.<br />This movie .was wonderful also.
B009NY3CL8|5.0|It has such a great cast and really appeals to kids and adults the same. We just love all the great humor, but the story of how Peter left and lost his way!
0399159347|5.0|The title maybe suggest that this husband has another family..<br /><br />Read this book! You will absolutely love the surprised ending.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is one of his best works ever. The Shining was a great book. Doctor Sleep is fantastic. Stephen King has hit it out of the park. I hope he stays with the game forever!
B0060V1WJ6|4.0|When it comes to romantic comedies, which I rarely watch, I generally don't have high expectations...I merely take it as something to entertain me for a couple hours.  This was good...I don't find Steve Carell 'hilarious' but I find Ryan Gosling stunning. Emma Stone's comedic timing was great. I read one review who said this movie was 'crude', so I was expecting bathroom humor and a lot of sexual overtures...not at all. It was actually refreshingly not crude. I don't know, perhaps my standards have been lowered. Great romantic scene...watched it twice.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|It was very good i will tell my friends to see ti.  more episodes soon i hope.  see soon please
B006TF6WAM|5.0|This gentle, moving book has many lovely symmetries: as Harold moves forwards, his memories work backwards; the growing physical distance from his wife slowly heals the emotional distance between them. The tender observations of life are deliciously written, and the reader is drawn to see the beauty of the ordinary and flawed. In the end, simple human connections are the conduits to redemption.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I like it but the bad thing is that for the shooters u only get 10 please fix that but the game is good
B00338QENI|5.0|Great book, especially for those in the health care industry. It's one I'll read again! I feel like I know Henrietta!
B009P5S11G|4.0|This album exceeded my expectations. Usually on an album I'll have two or three songs I hate, two or three I adore, and the rest are all right. This album, I love almost every single one. Rihanna has got such a great voice. Some of my favorite tracks:<br /><br />Diamonds<br />Stay<br />What Now<br />Get It Over With
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Whether you grew up in the 60's or only read about them, you will love this movie! Sorry I waited so long to view it!
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|I don't care what the critics say. This movie nailed it on the head. It captures the essence of the book perfectly. I'd like to say a few things on two elements people criticize: the modern day music, and all the CG. I think having period music wouldn't have given the movie the same kind of craziness. it helps drive across how vain and glitzy the 20s was. As for the CG, I like it for the same reasons. The emotions and activities of these people are so hollow and such, not as real as we would like. I think the loads of CG for everything went along with that. Then there's the beautiful song written by Lana Del Rey that fits perfectly. This is a great movie, with fantastic music, direction, and production design. In the case of the two disc special edition, I was not disappointed at all with the special features. Must have for Gatsby fans!
B00447L4KA|5.0|This is just a great/fun movie about high school....love/hate relationship....funny...great acting....really miss Heath Ledger...gone way to soon.....highly recommend this teenage movie!
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|I am glad Fleetwood Mac made this for their anniversary to mark their milestones,which they always seem to be attenitive to.They care deeply about what they do and always have.Each member cares deeply to make sure that when the albums go out they are excellent.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Awesome show. Well done and like no other. Hard to predict what would happen next. You will not regret it and be hooked from the first episode.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|I liked the movie and thought it was Good but not the original judge dredd if you know what I mean..
0307352145|5.0|It really made you appreciate introverts and their gifts.<br />I have ordered a book for my brother, a Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist.

B0091REZMW|5.0|Great game hours of play... Just need help from friends. But just love this game thanks. And I play it on facebook too love it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am still watching this season but it has not been a disappointment.  I really enjoy all aspects of this series.
B00F9A903O|5.0|It's better than the facebook game. It's got to fix on how to get friends so there could help but I like it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I started watching this series.  The acting is really good with a captivating story line
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Dear Minon lovers,<br />We all want a game with minions right,and some people like temple run so well if we combine minions with temple run we get Minon Rush. So buy the app because it has minions and it is free.<br />  Love,<br />  MLD
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This book was entertaining but not so great. Took a while to get into it in the beginning. Just ok.
0061950726|5.0|I loved it because I had no idea this ever happened in the uinited states.  The only thing that I thought was a bit contrived was that the two from the train would  meet again.  this was unlikely but made a good story.  We did have a good discussion at our club meeting.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It was a beautiful love story that made you cry at the end! It brought back memories of your first love!
B00BLSJI80|4.0|She has unique song. Every single track is different! And you cannot get enough of them. I love the album!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Good app.  Nice graphics.  The game lets you build habitats and breed dinosaurs.  Pretty basic for this type of game but well executed.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|This is a real problem with my kindle<br />The only thing that I would like is more than one game<br />The first time I love it<br />Thompson
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This fun cool awesome and I don't have a horse I have dog so I like this because it makes .me feel like I have horse but maybe one day I can get a horse but that's a long time from now cause im 9 :D
0425263924|4.0|The storyline seemed to lag at times during the book - partly I think due to the fact that the book was first going to be a 3 part book trilogy and in the end more book/books are being written.  Anxious to see book 4 and get more information on the storyline.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This is the closest anyone has come to making a sequel to one of the finest Sci-Fi films. Outstanding, I have no idea why this movie flopped, but I am glad it was made.
B00B5DWI2O|5.0|this is a stunning composer , musician and technician ... he has THE great talent that only few possess in this world of music ..<br /> very smooth , softly jazzy with classical trends . Highly recommend .
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Fringe has content that appeals to science fiction,  romance and drama audiences alike. Found myself  anxiously anticipating each episode. Very entertaining.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|After being familiar with Judge Dredd version, was curious and just wanted to see where it went.  I watched all the way through.  While Karl Urban did not try to imitate Sylvester Stallone, he nailed the role.  Great action and interesting plot line
B00CM4VC7M|5.0|This is my first SH Figuarts figure (my only other is a Revoltech), but I was expecting high quality, which I believe I got. :)<br /><br />The painting work on the final version is a bit sloppier than the prototype, and it seems like they may have used a different paint for the golds, so they look less metallic than I was expecting.  There are not a lot of paint errors though.  I was able to compare two different Moon Sticks since it comes with one that has the distinguish attached and one without it (which is amazing) and you can see a visible difference in how the moon rod was painted; however the details are still similar enough to not be too big of an issue and neither looks bad.<br /><br />The detail work on the moon sticks themselves is amazing, and is a wonderful replica of her stick from the anime.<br /><br />I did unbox her because I could simply not resist.  Her joints move well and are tight enough to hold their position without slipping, while not feeling too fragile.  Her hair WILL fall out of the buns if you try to move them too far, and the left pigtail seems to have a propensity; they are held in by the part that fits into her odango being a round ball, and the odango itself having a round opening where it just pops and sits in there; however the shape doesn't allow for much more movement than straight out to her sides (having the hair &#34;flow&#34; out behind her doesn't seem viable).<br /><br />I have not tried switching faces yet but they all have great paintjobs, and though you can see where her bangs can be removed, the sculpt has them fitting so well with the head that from a distance it looks like one piece.<br /><br />I love the shiny red they used on her odango hairpieces.<br /><br />The wide range of hands and expressions allows for duplicating many of her famous poses.<br /><br />The base she comes with is a heart with Sailormoon on it.  You have to place the stand arm in the point of the heart, so the part that says &#34;sailormoon&#34;faces away from the viewer.  Instead of a C-shaped clamp, the sides of the claw can be manually manipulated to open and close, so you aren't limited to only placing it around the small waist, and you're not forced to clip the figure into a solid piece of plastic, which is great. There is less of a chance of causing paint transferal or scratching the figure this way.<br /><br />Points of motion include her shoulders, her elbows, her hands (which pop out fairly easily for exchange but may fall out if you're not careful when posing), legs where they met her hips, knees, and feet. I believe you can bend the waist as well but didn't manipulate that as much.<br /><br />The soft PVC skirt has some &#34;give&#34; allowing you to bring her knees up a bit for a kicking or flying pose, which is great. My Idol M@sters figure has a skirt that is too hard to allow for much leg movement, so I was worried that would be the case with this figure. But the skirt is flared out quite a big to allow for more movement on top of having a bit of give, so Sailor Moon definitely has more motion in the legs.<br /><br />The detail on the bow and her brooch is very well painted as well.<br /><br />Overall I am extremely pleased with this figure. I'm a hardcore fan of Sailormoon, not so much a collector for the sake of owning a piece that will be worth a lot, but if you kept this in mint condition I think it would be worth a pretty penny in another 10 - 20 years.<br /><br />Oh! The box came with a bit of damage on one of the corners (not a whole lot but you can feel a slight warp) but otherwise pristine, with the seals still intact.
B003XMXZCW|5.0|Finally, a Blu Ray with all the Apocalypse version in one set.  Terrific viewing on my large screen TV Theater room.
B00479SVBU|3.0|I loved this transmitter till it wouldn't turn on. Tried changing the fuse still nothing so regretfully I had to send it back
1400069289|5.0|This book does a great job of jumping back and forth between explaining principles and theory, and illustrating those principles with extensive case studies.
B004A2V3K0|5.0|The name speaks for it's self. New and Classic. All i can say is &#34; Who doesn't LIke Bon Jovi?
B009BJAPLK|4.0|Enjoyable production. Quirky. My husband really enjoys it. Fantastic acting and interesting stories. They did a great job casting everyone. Look forward to more.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Great follow up to one of marvels best.  I hope there will be more iron man movies made and the actors are the best
B00DWV3NM6|5.0|This is an awesome card. I went from two GTX-670 SLI to one of these.<br /><br />I can play most games at 2560x1600 with ultra/max settings no problem. In fact, in most games, I get over 60fps easily. If not, I just dial down the AA to 4x or 2x which is all that is really needed at that high resolution, aliasing issues are not as noticeable at 1600p resolution.<br /><br />This card is soooo quiet, and the temps are really good. At stock frequencies, it idles at about 30-32C with ZERO fan noise. On real world game benchmarks, it goes up to about 55C max, that's amazing, and dead quiet. And on unrealistic benchmarks like Furmark, it reaches a max of 67C; at those temps, the fan has a very slight low frequency hum and is not really noticeable unless you get really close and pay attention to it. It's nothing like the high pitch whining I used to get from the GTX-670's I had with stock coolers.<br /><br />Bottom line: really good performance and really low temps on real world games, dead quiet, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it so much. Cant wait for Season 4, whats gonna happen...I cant  stand it. I l wanna watch until I cant keep my eyes open anymore
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|My complaint with this concert is that it's not one complete concert from start to finish.  May concerts were edited together to make the DVD and it's obvious in some parts with the transitions.  I would have preferred 1 concert shot from start to finish rather than several combined together.  Some of the editing is a bit weird as well.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|It was a cute movie. there have been a few put out since Ice Age, and they were ok. going to be hard to top Ice Age.
B00CHZ4CBY|5.0|Awesome figure! The details are insane and well worth the price! I highly recommend this figure for iron man fans.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This game would be amazingly fun if it worked. But for both of my devices the game fails to create anything I type in! Not even the ladder in the tutorial is created! I highly recommend people who download this app to be prepared for a let down in case they end up like me and buy the he and not even be able to play it and uninstall it. Waste of my money!
B00E9ZAT4Y|5.0|I think it is interesting to read that the Amazon UK website has this Mary Poppins Blu Ray now on pre-order and says that it wil be released on 18th November, while the US blu ray release will be nearly one month later on 10th December.<br />Of course the film will be beautifully restored on Blu ray and should be a great improvment over the previous remastering attempts.<br />I can't wait..so will be ordering from Amazon UK !!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so glad I started reading these books and I can't wait to read the last book and find out what happens!!
B00271DNP4|1.0|The movie was basically unwatchable.  Couldn't get through more than a minute or two at I time before it would stop.  Waste of money.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Connelly keeps you guessing in this one -- just as you think you've got the whole thing figured out he adds a new twist!
B002DQDV6Y|1.0|took two days to get through it, streaming was very bad. very disappointing, haven't had streaming issues with any other videos.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Love this book. Very descriptive I could almost feel Katniss's pain and that helps me to appreciate life. Who'd guess peeta was going to be with Katniss.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I loved this book . Well reserched and written like all Dan Brown novels . This one was a page burner. It's hard to put down because you can't believe what is going on!  There areso many surprise plot twist and turns that I was exclaiming out to the book and my wife wondered what was going on.  Said it was just a great book she should read and didn't' want to spoil any of it for her . Don't miss this book !
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Excellent service. Only problem is of course the smaller screen of cell phone.  But it is even easier to carry around!
B000PDYVVG|5.0|As I read this book I was going through a divorce and I felt everything the writer felt! Actually I have read it many times and purchased on my Kindle so I will have it forever!  Lots to learn about life and love!
B00DIFARQ6|4.0|another one my grandkids purchased.  My grandson loves planes and cars. It keeps them busy at doctors office and other appointments.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Having read this the first time several years ago, I found it equally thrilling on the second time through.  Well written, a great plot and characters provided with depth.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I have played a number of mahjong games and this one is great. It is easy enough for the whole family to enjoy.
B001FA0H3E|3.0|This is not Le Carr&eacute; better books. But, I am still amazed on Le Carr&eacute;'s knowledge on what is happening in the world and the secrets of the good guys and bad guys. The setting is Hamburg and a rather shaky financial firm who has a claim on it from a supposed terrorist and it seems the Germans, Brits, US, and terror world are quite interested in catching the bad guys and capturing those who want to support terrorism. Caught in the middle is a young lady civil lawyer who is the counselor for the young Chechen terrorist who doesn't seem to all there.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed the book a lot and the information that it gave me that I wanted to know plus it went well with the first book and I am excited to see what happens next.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Fun easy enough to play looking forward to more levels. Suitable for  Children ages 10 and up. Keeps you thinking.
1444777556|5.0|Loved the first book and loved this book, coudn't read it fast enough.  Warms the hear and soul, Want more of James and Bob!
B000WR7HFM|5.0|I like this album, especially the bonus tracks! It's nice to be able to listen to the extended versions of &#34;Everybody Wants To Rule The World&#34; and &#34;Shout&#34;.
B0001I561E|5.0|A favorite movie of my childhood. Definitely can't go wrong with a Disney Classic like this one! Not disappointed with this purchase.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic Stephen King minus much of his old off-topic indulgences, briskly and smartly paced, an excellent sequel to 'The Shining'.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is very erotic, romantic, and it keep me very interested. To E.L. James, I love the book, Well done.
B0089LOG02|5.0|A beautifully written descriptive, heartbreaking, astonishing, sad, journey that hundreds of thousands of children were forced to undertake. The resiliency of human nature and our strong innate capacity to survive are captured in this strong, easy to read narrative. You'll be shocked, you'll laugh and cry as you follow the children's journey and the intertwining of their lives through future generations.  A must read and as well as a book you'll find hard to put down.
B00FFJ1GG8|5.0|\\"Beautiful LEGO\\" is different from any other LEGO-related book I've seen. It's not aimed particularly at kids, and it's not a how-to book. (There are no step-by-step instructions.) What it is is a handsome coffee table book showcasing amazing artistic creations using LEGOs. My son, an avid builder, was so inspired by reading this book that he started to work on some of his own creations right away.<br /><br />One important aspect is that the book does not only contain pictures of awe-inspiring, massive works that take 100s of hours to put together. (It does have those, though - for example the cover image.) It also features small, innovative pieces that are not unlike what my son has created - with the additional eye and palette of an experienced artist. This is what is most clever about the book. While it features amazing artworks, many of them could be rebuilt by young readers - or even be the starting point for new creations.  And the breadth is outstanding - from faithful historical replicas to way-out fantasy pieces. My son feels as if this book were created just for him.<br /><br />So \\"Beautiful LEGO\\" is a coffee table book, and an inspirational guide for builders of any age. Beautiful!
B005VBFW5G|5.0|I now have three pairs of these bibs as my original pair became my go-to bike shorts this summer.  I have been riding in Gore shorts for a couple of years now and at the end of last season finally upgraded to bibs.  Very happy with the fit, quality, and comfort.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. I made a tree house and a town in no time at all. I play with my brother all the time and we made  hideouts. I made a school with him too. You should buy this game.
B00594XOZU|2.0|Worked pretty good at first for the past two years I Been using it then when I logged out it and tried to log back in it would say &quot; this is taking longer than it should try again in a bit&quot;  :/
B005PJU16O|5.0|I actually bought this as a gift. 10 months later they've almost finished. Really detailed and smart. I'm not sure if you can still get these.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|First, let me say. I don't like zombie movies. Never have, never will, but this movie was quite captivating with a whole different approach. It was a unique story line and was exciting in every respect. I recommend this movie and if you're a zombie fan....you'll love it.
1423140591|5.0|If you have read Riordan's work you'll probably like it. It starts right after The Lost Hero book ended and tells you more about the Roman camp and expands in a good way Percy Jackson's universe.<br /><br />Great series of books worth reading for pre-teens and teenage kids.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Cannot rate this product because I went out of town before it was scheduled to arrive,<br />asked my neighbors to keep an eye out for it, but the product was never received and<br />I'm not sure I have a valid case for recovery because I was gone four weeks. I'm going to<br />try to contact someone at Amazon for some satisfaction.
1423140605|5.0|Riordan keeps up what he started with The Lost Hero, this time he brings together the characters of booth previous books and finally joins them right after were The Son of Poseidon left off.<br /><br />The book shows the adventures of the 7 main characters leading with their differences with the greek and roman style, many more new adventures now focused in Italy with a cliff hanger ending just making you want to read ASAP the next book due to be released in October 2013.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|Perhaps it's too early to give an honest review of this movie. Although it was vintage Iron Man, it<br />was too much of the same. Will probably appreciate it down the road but for now it was just a<br />ho hum Ironman.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|If you missed it in thetheaters and you like romantic comedies (not a chick-flic per se) you might like it. It has a great story, the actors play their roles amazingly no wonder they won Oscars or were nominated, even Chris Tucker in a serious OCD role looks great. a nice movie to watch in family time.
B00DWZHTRW|3.0|Once again, I think this is a movie that I'll appreciate somewhere down the road. I did enjoy it, the storyline was unique and everyone played their part flawlessly and the ending was certainly unexpected but I'll need to put it on the shelf and pull it out when I need a magic fix. For now I'll say that it was a good buy and recommend it.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|This new story by Tarantino is great but you should like his movies to not be offended by the approach he has on the slavery subject in America. It is greatly violent, brutal but stetic.<br /><br />Di Caprio as a southern villains is awesome as well as Christoph Waltz as a german gun slinger. The movie has a fast pace so you don't fill the 2 and a half hours it last.<br /><br />I highly recommend it
1401922732|5.0|I have wanted these cards for a long time... they came sealed in wrap and the box holding the cards is sturdy 'lift top' lid type.  Golden edges are delecate.... do not shuffle like ordinary cards!  Read the instructions before using cards.... must cleanse cards spiritually and know how to keep them clean.  So far I am very impressed with not only the quality and the low price; but am thrilled at new peace my readings have brought me.  Thank you, Doreen Virtue...!<br /><br />Update 1/6/14... added photos to my profile images.
142311339X|5.0|After Percy Jackson´s series this a great follow up with new characters, new gods we hadn't heard before that expands the 21st Century greek mythology in America. You will read about many of the characters you liked in Percy's series but you will get to know many more rich and fasisnating characters.
B002361MLA|5.0|I did 65yrs. finding the same answers that is in this book...<br />Two times I had contact with the GOD connection in our heads...<br />Age 60 and 61...<br />Found &#34;pure&#34; energy...
B005PK56TA|5.0|Creepy in all the right ways! Creepy because of the people's characters not hokey ghost issues. Cerebral, suspense, perfect series can't wait to see the other 2 seasons
B007SGM084|5.0|I thought I would be uninterested or even disgusted but was very surprised. I couldn't put it down. I actually found it very interesting.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wow!! This book is Amazing.  It should be a required book for all school age children.  If only there were more Jack's and Summer's in the world! I loved this book, fall in love with the characters, beautifully written, no \\"wonder\\" there are so many 5 star reviews! This book had me crying like a baby.  Great job to the author, thank you for such a wonderful read!
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is the first book I've read by the author and now I can't wait to read more of her work.  This book pulls you in from the beginning all the way to the end. It was hard to put down.  I love Vivian's spirit and attitude and how Molly made a dramatic transformation.  I had no idea about the orphan trains. Great history lesson.
B008XG1X18|1.0|i cannot get log on to it.....it keeos saying it does not recognize my email...makes no difference how many times i submit it
B005VPRFSY|5.0|I got the set in perfect conditions. The set itself is beautiful and the minifigures are among the best in the Lego Star Wars franchise.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|Zeb's storyline was entertaining and I enjoyed this book overall. I would say that it is the weakest of the trilogy, but I have no regrets for having read it.
B00DQC2FPM|4.0|When I looked for this item I went through a lot of reviews, and some of them noted that some parts may fall down when the set was complete. That happened to me. The doors fall down sometimes because they are supported by only one piece. Also, only one minifig fits in the car. But those are not, by any means, deal breakers. The set is awesome, is a one in a lifetime piece that celebrates both a great toy brand and one of the funniest and most beloved movie series of all time.<br />I'm very happy with the set, the rotating wheels are the cutest and a lot of details make it look great, like the flux capacitor and the time panel.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This was a book club selection that I enjoyed.  Extremely quick read, if not somewhat cliche.  While the voice is that of a teenage girl, I felt Green did a good job of elevating the language into a believable, intelligent account of how a terminally ill adolescent can hold the dichotomy of alarming maturity and perspective while also possessing an endearing innocence and naïveté.
1419705644|5.0|This book is just awesome, the design, the contents. Even if you are not a fan of the TV Show you'll find a lot of charm in this book. Totally recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|EVERYONE LOVES MINECRAFT!!!!!!! This game is AWSOME! If only there was an infinite star rating and this would have a couple...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is a fun game to play.  The game is somewhat small for the game but I can increase the size somewhat bigger and have fun playing while waiting for appointments.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I had mixed feelings about Still Alice. It was well written and obviously well researched. The reason I had mixed feelings is because my mother is currently suffering from Alzheimer's Desease. She is in the end stages where she does not speak or know who anyone is anymore. Still Alice was very insightful in showing how my mother as well as my father-in-law must have felt as they found themselves slipping away. It made me cry, but I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Alzheimer's as experienced from the victim's side as opposed to the care-giver's side.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|Love this band and this album!  My favorite song on here is days are gone.  Really love all the songs on here though, can't wait to see them live on the 18th!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I used the app to download 2 books to read on my Android Digital 2 pad.  It was easy to down load the app and the books.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Love Castle.  looking forward to many more seasons. It is a funny, family oriented show with quirky humor.  Recommended to all my friends who are also becoming Castle fans.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is so much better the second time around. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys this genre.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is Super Heroes on steroids. This movie is so good that everyone who remotely likes the hero/graffic art genre should see this movie. It's very entertaining and well done.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I couldn't wait to catch up with Danny.  I was not disappointed with this story and I would recommend this book
B00F35BV64|1.0|I am unable to put into words my disgust for this film.  Without giving away details, this movie goes where no Trek has gone before, straight to the trash pile.  The characters are flat and still lack development, it's like we're supposed to know them already...<br />If your going to do a reboot, then you have to tell the story... not just throw them around in special effected action sequences.<br />This is one of the greatest science fiction franchises ever, but science fiction need science to work, we're just that sophisticated now.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|So hardwork alone doesn't make one a success, there are other things, like luck, that plays into...I could of told you that, but not so masterfully!...The author builds his cases for his claims in this book like a master lawyer does in his courtroom. This book is art, a true masterpiece where every reader will be blessed differently for taking the short amount of time it takes to get through it. A must read for all that have ever ventured after their goals and have fallen short, for sure...Maybe, just maybe, it wasn't completely your fault.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I was so happy when this game became available on the kindle fire....I had it on my phone but my phone would always freeze up.  I play it every day.....gotta love those minions!!
B0014JLYS8|1.0|Bought these Crocs for my husband and although barely worn the soles began coming off. I've never seen a pair of Crocs do this...and I've bought MANY. These shoes are one solid piece except the soles, which are the ridges on the bottom, and they are glued on to the shoe itself. He had to pull the soles apart from the shoes and now the bottoms are very slick...which is not good. Pathetic manufacturing.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|This is one of the best shows Ive seen in a long long long time. The first season ties into the second season. I did like the second season more than the first and love the first so thats saying a lot lol. WATCH WATCH
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Excellent game and very fanny! Good work! Easy to play and spend your time.<br />Pretty friendly with battery life also.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|Movie was stupid and the concept was disturbing to say the least. Poor kids killing other poor kids for the enjoyment of the rich. A socialist propaganda gone completely awry!
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|I love this series and would hope they could bring something back similar to it. Season 5 is good but it starts to ware on u whats going on.
B00FGM0IEU|4.0|Very well done. You'll likely be surprised how much music comes from this beautiful, soulful, corner of the world. An insightful and entertaining look at why and how &#34;Muscle Shoals sound&#34; came to be.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Helped me discover new ideas and how to make myself better. It's a new era for business thinking and I'm going to start now.
B0091WUF3U|3.0|Great movie and all, but until I can download HD to Amazon Unbox on my computer movies can't get more than 3 stars.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Excellent!<br />It keeps you entangled with the characters and the story. I can't wait to see what happen next! Mockinjay!
B00CTT9646|5.0|This was a great movie and the phaser only added to the experience. I was an excellent purchase. Shipping could have been faster for the price, but I loved the item.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Loved SG-1 and the continuation is just as hooking. Definitely keeps you engaged and on the edge of your seat.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great CD, every song is awesome and love Amazon prime as I received it within 2 days of ordering. JT's music and talent is amazing, I really loved every song and play this on long drives.
B0014DW3OS|3.0|The movie was OK, I liked it enough to watch it till the end. I did not like Denzel Washington in thise role, I guess I like him being a &#34;good guy&#34; rather than a &#34;bad guy&#34;.<br />I think that most guys would like this movie. It's not one that would make my &#34;watch it again&#34; list.
B008Y5UADK|3.0|I wasn't impressed, maybe because I expected the main character to actually find that 'long digit number'. Brainiacs might enjoy this movie more.
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|This a good follow-up to the first Star Trek film released by the Bad Robot people.  Many complained about the Khan character. I think he was a good choice and very believable.  Lots of violence and explosions. Seems to me there is becoming less science fiction and more explosions in these new Star Trek films.  Anyways, you will like this film if you enjoyed the first one.
B00DYFCYSO|2.0|If you are a John Legend fan... you will probably love this CD.  I bought it because I loved one song, and that was the only song I could stomach.  This CD would have to be played on random with a variety of other cd's for me to ingest the cd in it's entirety.... no my favorite, by all mean.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|This is a fun movie with lots of trickery and deception. Of course it is over-the-top, what do you expect from a Hollywood magic film? This is worth a good watch.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I loved the characters and story lines.  The acting was great. I could hardly wait to see what happened in the next episodes.
B00AHJL7BK|4.0|Since I like Sudoku, I thought I would give this game a try.  It is fun.  On the hard level it is a bit of a challenge.  The pencil mode is a bit quirky, but it works fine once you get used to it.  I got it as FAOTD.  I probably wouldn't pay $3 for it, but if you like number puzzles it might be worth it to you.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This movie is definitely a favorite with my two-year-old. Since he's figured out how to work the iPad, I find him watching it ALL the time. We now have to limit him to just once a day (and have to hide the iPad to ensure this). Great buy and we love all the versions included!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Best keyboard app available. Have tried many others, but SwiftKey can't be beat. I use this app across all my Android devices.
B00ET47USI|3.0|I have played many spider solitaire games and this one is good.  A few things that could be improved are when you hit exit, it deals another hand.  The cards do not move easily with the mouse or stylist-you have to press hard with the stylist and often have to click several times to select and move a card.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I was intrigued by the same story told by the other character. At first I thought it would be silly but it really gave a whole different angle  to the story.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This game has far too many ad's. Every deal is interrupted by an ad. Also, many of the ads crash.
B00DHHWYAW|5.0|This is a movie which definitely should be watched in a large screen, since it's so colorful and full of detail. I had a grand time immersed in this world of decadent luxury. The party scenes are outstanding, beautifully filmed, with vibrant colors. The modern music blended in perfectly, which really suprised me. Tobey and Leonardo did an excellent job, as well. Great movie overall.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is a great game only if the price was not so high great game though get it for a great time playing the game
0345803507|5.0|I loved the 50 Shades triology....enough to reread it. Lay aside your preconceived notions and fall in love with Anastasia and Christian!
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I'm a little confused on how to use this mmmmmmmm it wbejsjsjsbsjdj Jens he did Sheehan.  She he s dvh
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King - ever since reading Firestarter as an eleven year old with her flashlight under the covers!!! I have lost my interest in some of his recent works but this book takes me right back to those times. I couldn't put it down and loved the continuation of Danny's story. As with most of King's stories there is a flawed hero who proves there is still good in a world that is filled with bad and how everyone straddles that line. There is redemption for mistakes but it's not an easy road to travel and what you wind up with depends on you. I hope Mr. King has much more in that wicked scary brain of his!!!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|My favorite super hero from marvel is iron man because he's the funniest and coolest super guy in the world. I think this game is the best game ever from a hero game get this game it's going to make you be enjoyed for a long. Please get this game I bet your going to love it<br />Game loft wins again like always.
B00AA0TZTW|3.0|I am a real fan of Hendrix.  There probably is a reason that these songs were never released. Not hit material (my opinion)...But if you are a Hendrix fan, or even a Hendrix wanna be musician, this CD provides excellent insight into the man's unbelievable talent.  Has some yet unheard great guitar licks.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Finally a Star Trek for the new generation. Pine & Quinto rock. Urban really captures McCoy. Need more stories though.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I guess the problem with reading reviews before hand is the expectations of a book, and that is what happened to me with this.  Everyone promised an interesting surprising twist, so when it came, i wasn't so surprised.  A good enjoyable read, and its nice to see a female character with this amount of depth, and not typical characterization.
B00CRVZRUS|4.0|Not as good as A Hard Days Night.  But I paid to see HELP  twelve times in the theater!  Ah youth.
B00F9040HU|4.0|I always play on my pc.  I wish they would make it for windows phone.I definitely am going to buy it.
B006M4F67A|5.0|It's easy to play and it's a challenge too. I would recommend this game to everyone.give it a try. I think you'll love it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen king at his best. The book I have been waiting for. Thanks for the characters and making them come back to life. It was a great story and good characters back for more. You can always make a person believe. Thanks for the good read.
B0050Q3TDY|4.0|I am strictly a jazz aficionado and love the intent behind this app and the service itself. However, I am not ready to jump to this because the categories are not as well defined as they could be. What I mean is if I select, say, the saxophone channel I will get everyone from Coleman Hawkins to popular saxophonists from today's generation. While it's gratifying to know that there is a new crop of players keeping the music alive I prefer older stuff.<br /><br />That is not to say that this station does not have merit - it does. It's just that it's not fine grained enough right now. I have no doubt that it will improve as it evolves which is why I gave it four stars -  a pretty high rating by any standard. Here is what it needs that Pandora already has:<br /><br />Channels by musician. What I mean by that is if I am Thelonious Monk fan I can expect a lot of his work, but the channel should also have a smattering of Bud Powell, Dodo Marmarosa, Al Haig and others. Pandora does that and I have discovered (or rediscovered) musicians I would not have considered until their music came up in the playlist. Yes, this does something similar, but is not segmented by era and genre the way Pandora is.<br /><br />Another feature that I would love is the ability to read bios of the currently playing musician as well as key features of the music itself. Again, Pandora does that and I hope this application and service behind it does the same.<br /><br />Finally, it's the functional controls that I miss as well. Here I cannot skip past a some I dislike or look ahead in the queue to cherry pick what I want to hear next. Such a feature would allow me to get more use and enjoyment from this app and service because it empowers me to control what I listen to. Pandora allows some of that. Where Pandora beats this in the functional area, though, is it seems to have adaptive learning built-in where it learns what I like and anticipates my choices. At present the playlists on Pandora are more aligned to my tastes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I have a feeling that this application and service will evolve into a more useful, mature listening experience. That's why the app will remain on my phone and I will frequently revisit it to see the improvements and progress. However, I am not ready to switch over for the reasons cited.ligned to my tastes.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I have a feeling that this application and service will evolve into a more useful, mature listening experience.

0312321376|1.0|How does this get published?  There nothing new here, it just rambles on about stories with little info or facts.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|My wife and I have been Castle fans since the very first episode of season 1 and we pre-order each new season on DVD as soon as Amazon lists it.  Having been huge Nathan Fillion fans ever since the Firefly series and the movie Serenity, and having seen his other poorly written TV series, we were delighted with every aspect of Castle, and season 5 was just as great as all the previous seasons.  This set is highly recommended for all Castle fans!
B000IU3XTW|5.0|I love this.  Dave does acoustic so well.  It has been several years and is still good.  I have the video also.
B00BEIYOHC|5.0|\\"Insidious Chapter 2\\" is a smart, spooky, stylish supernatural thriller that may even be better than the first movie. It is also the perfect example of why a good movie depends on more than a good director.<br /><br />I can't really talk about the plot of this movie without giving away spoilers from either this movie or the previous one, since it's basically a continuation of the paranormal terrorism faced by the Lambert family. Basically, there is a woman in white, and a woman in black, each stalking the boundaries between life and death, and each with sinister intentions towards one member or another of the family. With the help of detectives, psychics, and paranormal investigators, the mother and father (who may or may not be possessed) try to solve the deadly mysteries that follow them.<br /><br />Director James Wan has the strange honor of directing both the best horror film of the year, \\"Insidious Chapter 2\\" and the worst horror film of the year, \\"The Conjuring\\". I've always liked Wan's style - there is a kind of hyper-real theatricality to his filmmaking, and there is kind of a trademark visual style that he uses in all his films. But what separates \\"The Conjuring\\" from \\"Insidious\\" is the writing.<br /><br />\\"The Conjuring\\" was written by guys that wrote episodes of the \\"Baywatch Nights\\" TV show, as well as the Paris Hilton horror movie \\"House of Wax\\". The \\"Insidious\\" movies are written by Leigh Wannell, who also wrote several of the \\"Saw\\" movies. Now, you can say what you want about the damage to society inflicted by the torture-porn genre, but the screenplays of the \\"Saw\\" films were cleverly written to loop back and forth on each other, making a sort of meta-puzzle that could only be clearly seen from a distance above them all. Whannell does the same thing here. Some puzzling events from the first \\"Insidious\\" movie (that I thought were plot holes) are explained here. You can't really appreciate what this movie does if you don't remember the first one.<br /><br />Sure, \\"Insidious\\" covers similar territory to every other horror movie of the past 40 years (and who are we kidding, the Lambert family is just an updated version of the Freeling family from \\"Poltergeist\\"), but Whannell and Wan do pull some new things out of the bag. Instead of slamming the audience through 90 minutes of random non-stop funhouse scares (like \\"The Conjuring\\"), Whannell is willing to let the story marinate for awhile, requiring some actual brain activity and memory recall from the audience. You don't have to understand \\"The Conjuring\\" to experience the fright scenes (mostly because there is nothing to understand), but some of the impact of \\"Insidious\\" only comes when you put the pieces together yourself.<br /><br />The movie is rated PG-13 because there is no gore. But that doesn't mean it's a soft movie. There are real adult situations here, including psychosexual child abuse, serial killers, and the most over-the-top crazy mother since \\"Mommy Dearest\\".<br /><br />If you see only one horror movie this year, see \\"Insidious Chapter 2\\". Well, if you've seen the first one.<br />Sure, \\"Insidious\\" covers similar territory to every other horror movie of the past 40 years (and who are we kidding, the Lambert family is just an updated version of the Freeling family from \\"Poltergeist\\"), but Whannell and Wan do pull some new things out of the bag.

B008LZHA3G|1.0|This is not the Dylan of the 60's.  It's not for me. Don't bother with this CD, there is better music out there.
B0001I561E|5.0|My kids watched it 4 times in a row!  Great movie and an all time classic Disney movie.  Worth the money.
B00A8V3VVG|2.0|I liked the movie and thought the soundtrack would be fun to listen to.  Wrong.  There's dumb dialog interspersed throughout the CD.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|The title explains it all. Ads that I couldn't close. Here are more words to bring it to the twenty that are required. Uninstalled.
B00063EMJ6|4.0|I like the fact it has Harvest Moon and Ohio songs.  But I have Disc 1 of the Decade album that I like better.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|was looking for something entertaining and a bit different then the routine shows on tv.  My husband and I both like the show.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I bought this adapter five months ago and have been using it since then. It functions well and never causes any issues for me. I also like the simple and elegant design of it. It matches my mac air perfectly. It is a little pricy compared with other adapters, but I think it is worth the money.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|I'm not a gamer.  I'm a business person and do a lot in excel, word and outlook.<br /><br />I've been through a number of specialty mice in my search for improved productivity from vendors like Logitec and Microsoft. I even tried a 15 button shuttle pro. The programability of this mouse is simply off the charts.  You can do what you want with every button - every other gaming mouse I've bought had limitations. With 7 buttons you can automate cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, delete and enter.  That cuts out a huge number of moves to the keyboard or a screen icon.  The mouse has memory for two programs so I have a specialty set of functions programmed for heavy duty excel work [paste values for instance, a pain to execute otherwise].  They say 9 buttons but left and right click shouldn't be changed IMO.<br /><br />Being able to fine tune how the cursor moves on the screen and how responsive it is to double clicks is really helpful.  I never bothered with the weights, the lighter the better, cuts down on wrist stress.<br /><br />A few reviews say you are stuck with the hokey anchor light.  Not true, you can turn it right off.  Those reviewers simply didn't go deep enough into the programming options or the software changed recently.<br /><br />Now there is one glaring omission from this mouse which is why I won't give it a top rating.  The scroll wheel is not responsive to a left or right push which is standard on even a $5 mouse!  You can't skid past the right or left on a document that is larger than your screen.  Bummer, means I need to have my old mouse plugged in for those situations.<br /><br />Not so many business users venture into the gaming mouse zone. It is definitely worth exploring and so far the Anchor mouse is the best I've found.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Read this book for my book club.  Enjoyed it but lots of sad parts.  I liked the way the characters were tied together.  Sometimes a little difficult to figure out who was telling their story in some parts since there were many characters.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Love detective shows, interesting characters and like the twists and turns that it takes.  Great interaction between the characters, just something unique.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I decided to check out the books the Longmire TV series was based on since I really liked the show.  The books are even better than the show (like books usually are!).

B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|The action here is  great and it is a completely separate story from the first movie.  Some of it is predictable but still quality.,

B00821PCJS|3.0|I pushed on throughout series one even though the plots and storylines were a bit slow.  I started watching series two but just could not keeping going, so I gave up.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I generally like movies where a bunch of strangers facing various types and degrees of crisis have intersecting lives for a while, and I liked this one too.  For me, the biggest strength of the movie was the contemporary Indian cultural setting of the movie.  But on the negative side, I felt that this movie over-reached, in the sense of each character stretching the limits of plausibility and too much happening to them in too short a span of time.  This 'bursting of the fictional bubble' causes me knock a star off my rating, but I can still recommend the movie to people who generally like this genre.
B008602KQI|2.0|After reading the book I was so excited to watch the movie. I was in for a disappointment.<br /><br />Now, I know it is hard to translate a book into a two hour movie and retain all the same depth and detail. However, like previous reviewers have stated, this movie was cleaned up to be able to market to a wider PG-13 audience, which I'm sure brought in a lot of revenue but left me wanting more.
0316204366|4.0|I have read and reviewed all of Malcolm Gladwell's previous books and consider him to be among the most talented and energetic of journalists, with most of his work featured in The New Yorker. He also has superb storyteller skills. His \\"discoveries\\" tend to be well-known to those knowledgeable about the given subject. In The Tipping Point, for example, he discusses a phenomenon previous characterized by Michael Kami as a \\"trigger point\\" and later by Andrew Grove as an \\"inflection point.\\" Or consider \\"the secret of success\\" that he discusses in The Outliers. For decades, Anders Ericsson and his associates at Florida State University have been conducting research on peak performance. (Moreoever, they have been standing \\"atop the \\"shoulders\\" of Adriaan de Groot.) Gladwell duly acknowledges sources such as Ericsson and should be praised for attracting greater attention to the subjects he discusses. That is his great value.<br /><br />However, in his latest book, David and Goliath, he demonstrates faulty reasoning, such as what Christopher Chabris characterizes as \\"the fallacy of the unexamined premise.\\" He also has problems with causal relationships and this is not the first time that Gladwell confuses \\"because\\" with \\"despite.\\" For example, consider his assertion that attorney David Boies's great success is largely explained by the fact that he is dyslexic. Overcoming learning disabilities may have been - for Boies as well as countless others -- what Warren Bennis and David Thomas characterize as a \\"crucible\\" that strengthens and enlightens those who emerge from it.<br /><br />In this context, I am reminded of the fact that one of the world's most renowned authorities on ADHD, Edward (\\"Ned\\") Hallowell, is an author of countless books and articles on the subject, a child and adult psychiatrist, and a New York Times bestselling author. Also, he is a graduate of Harvard College and Tulane Medical School as well as the founder of The Hallowell Centers in Sudbury, Massachusetts, and New York City. Are these great achievements because or despite the fact that Hallowell is ADHD?<br /><br />In his latest book, Gladwell relies too heavily on insufficient evidence or, worst yet, only on evidence that supports his premise.  Yes, peak performers such as Boies, Richard Branson, Brian Glazer, David Neeleman, and Charles Schwab overcame severe learning disabilities and yes, 12 of 44 U.S. Presidents (including the first and the current) lost their father at an early age. There is no shortage of examples of women as well as men who have a \\"story of success\\" despite all manner of physical, social, and/or economic limitations.<br /><br />Gladwell is at his best when sharing what he has learned after exploring subjects of special interest to him. As indicated, I admire his skills as a journalist and storyteller. What I view as his defective reasoning skills detract from the presentation of some (not all) of the material in David and Goliath, hence the Four Star rating.tts, and New York City.

B004L3AQFG|5.0|On one level there's no reason this film should work as well as it does.  The story is public knowledge so there's no real suspense in the traditional sense.  But between the brilliant direction by Danny Boyle, and the smashing performance by James Franco this transcends to be not a film of suspense, but a character study of a very real, flawed but likeable person in a nightmare situation any of us can imagine.  We descend into his lonely hell with him and emerged amazed by the resilience of this young man in particular, but also by life in general.  I found it less 'thrilling', but - more important - far more moving than I expected.<br /><br />Boyle works wonders in making what is essentially a one-character, single-location film never feel static or dull, and the gruesome climax is almost unbearable to watch without ever feeling exploitive.

0525478817|5.0|Although the subject and story are great it is the author's beautiful use of language that made this book so much fun to read.  That's right, it's a book about kids with cancer and I laughed through half of it.  The characters are so wonderfully believable.  Wise beyond their years yet still teenagers.
0393317552|5.0|I wholeheartedly recommend this book for anyone with an interest in history. And for anyone at all, for that matter.
B004HD61KE|5.0|No disappointment here . As with all his work Rollins continues to keep you interested in the story ,invested in the characters and on the edge of your seat amazed at the technology his research has given him to weave into his stories.  This is the second time I have read this book and enjoyed it just as much as I did the first time. I have read all his books and not been  disappointed yet . I remain in great anticipation of the next book . His books are all great reads so don't cheat yourself out of great reads. If it has his name on it count on it for great reading.
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Having followed/watched the series since birth and being a scifi enthusiast it was nice to have another trek movie. thrums up
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved the book, great story telling as always, but i have to admit that I was a bit put off by the 'product placement' throughout the story.  none of the product placement added anything to the story, but actually took away from it, because it was distracting.
B005LAIIGW|5.0|One of the most talked about trailers of the year has been the two-minute trailer for \\"Gravity\\" that features Sandra Bullock and George Clooney floating in space. In the two-minutes, we see a brief intense and desperate moment in the span of a long movie where Bullock's character, Ryan Stone, tries to grab hold of anything and everything as her situation spins out of control. Many thought, \\"Is that it? Is that what the movies about?\\" or, \\"Two people in space. That movie looks silly.\\" Well, \\"Gravity\\" is far from silly.<br /><br />On the other hand, what you see in that trailer is exactly what you will have in store when you sit down to watch it. It is exactly what the movie is about and there are only two people in the entire movie. You will also see an amazingly well crafted, intelligent, exquisite and visceral space journey that possibly puts all other movies of the same vain to shame.<br /><br />Regardless of what you think of the trailer, you couldn't take your eyes off of it for two-minutes and that is exactly the way the full 90-minute movie is. \\"Gravity\\" takes you into space and treats you as if you were a tag-along for Ryan Stone's journey. The direction of Alfonso Cuaron is spot on, if not for a few minor moments of over-dramatization.<br /><br />Cuaron may be most well known for his direction of \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", but he also directed \\"Children of Men\\" and one of my personal favorites, \\"A Little Princess\\". This is a phenomenal achievement for Cuaron and for the history and future of film-making. If you've ever desired to go to space, this may be as close as you will ever get. \\"Gravity\\" rings authentic and it is exactly what movies are all about, taking you, the viewer along for a journey that you can't get in your ordinary life.

B000FILW86|5.0|Somehow I missed this offering from one of my favorite bands of all time. Thanks to satellite radio and Little Stephen's Underground Garage, I heard one of the tunes and thought, is there a new album out? Upon further investigation, I found that the record had been released years ago. Either I wasn't paying attention or they just don't promote like they used to, not to mention the extinction of contemporary earth based radio as we knew it, another subject for another day. In any event, I simply bought the CD and to say I wasn't disappointed would be an understatement. This record rocks! From chimey Beatle like ballads to ringing 60's style radio classics to heavy thunder rockers, this band continues to churn out great material. These guys get it. Their concerts are thrillers, they are as engaging as anything on stage and their material from a years long repertoire always satisfies. The album has no dogs, just pure rock and roll from beginning to end. It would have been a shame had I not listened to XM radio....I probably would have never heard this gem.

To cut a long story short, we rented it and totally enjoyed it, it had good action as well as suspense, can't wait to watch part 2.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|First let me say do not expect \\"The Shining - Part 2.\\"  Doctor Sleep is not that. It's not scary, but (let's face it) King hasn't written anything scary in at least 20 years. I like the King of old when he was drunk, doing coke, and probably a real a-hole to be married to. Much scarier writing.<br />But Doctor Sleep is still good. Catching up with Danny Torrence is the reason to read the novel.  Even the old, burned down Overlook Hotel plays a big part in it.  It's a very sentimental book, like King met up with an old friend and is telling us about it. Definitely worth adding to your Stephen King collection.
B000BNX3B4|5.0|This is a good movie as it has good actors, some dogs (if you are a dog lover), Christopher Plummer and some funny situations that will make you laugh and cring.

B005S9EJ14|3.0|Since the success of Slumdog Millionaire, the film industry has started to realise that India is a big and potentially exciting setting for films.<br />The best things about Best Exotic Marigold Hotel are the setting, in a romantic ramshackle picturesque old building in India, and the fact that it takes older people as its lead characters. We are living in an age of old age, with more old people than ever before, and oldies want to be centre stage! Oldies are interesting, oldies still have strong feelings and passions, oldies even have good ideas.<br />However, the film's entertainment is really on a fairly lightweight level. The storylines are not very gripping and the film is marred by the inclusion of a completely ridiculous homosexual romance. It is just not believable that two teenage boys who had a scuffle or a pash when they were 18 should meet again after fifty years and fall into each other's arms like true-lovers. The fact that they have both been married with children and are now grandfathers makes it even more ridiculous! This is a bit of embarrassing LGBT propaganda built into an otherwise entertaining film.
0061978078|5.0|thought Delirium was brilliant, but let me just say that Pandemonium was even better. Action packed without ever a dull moment and the stunning prose that left me once again blown away and suspense that kept my heart racing; this is definitely becoming one of my favourite series I have read this year.<br /><br />In short: My reaction after finishing<br /><br />MINDBLOWN.<br /><br />\\"If you're smart, you care. And if you care, you love.\\"<br /><br />Picking up where Lena left off from the first book and split into 'then' and 'now', I loved how this book really offered two sides of the story and highlighted how Lena changed. She experienced life in the Wilds and met new people. Transformed into an almost completely new person, Lena leaves all the comforts of her former home and life behind in order to become part of the resistance movement against 'the cure'. All the secondary characters were likeable for the most part and had their personalities shine through.<br /><br />To be honest, I don't really know how much I should really give away in this review because there is just so much that happens with twists and action around every corner. I would definitely think that this book reads at a much faster pace than the first novel, and much to its advantage. I found that at the end of every chapter there was a new mystery or element of suspense forming, and at some parts I really did feel like I was at the movies with my heart racing in the middle of a thriller film. In contrast, one aspect of the novel that was the same as Delirium was the beautiful writing style with enough realism to make it relatable to and engaging for its intended audience. It is such a joy to read a novel like this and made my reading experience even better.<br /><br />*CONCLUSION*<br /><br />In conclusion, Pandemonium is a seriously addictive and exhilarating sequel in what is so far an amazing series. With twists and turns at every corner and more questions made than answered, there is no doubt that I am highly anticipating reading the final installment: Requiem. Here's to hoping that it lives up to the success of it's predecessors and once again blows me away!at I am highly anticipating reading the final installment: Requiem.

1607066017|5.0|That any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic is what makes Vaughan's SAGA a fantasy. It is the narrator's coming of age starting literally at birth. Hazel's parents are from opposite sides of a continuing interstellar war who have \\"met cute\\", discussed literature (a tale of Earth-like manners with a bodice-ripper cover), and excited the ire of royal drones with monitor heads, bounty hunters with bizarre shapes and pets, and (of course) the in-laws. I was so taken with the SAGA, that I ordered Vol. 2 once I started reading Vol. 1.<br /><br />But it is Fiona Staples' artwork which makes Vaughan's SAGA really magical. Not only does she capture perfectly Vaughan's fantastical future (reminiscent of Chaykin's IRONWOLF) with its wooden spaceships and disemboweled babysitting ghosts; but Fiona Staples' art is a revelation in itself. Each panel is highly detailed with crisply limned foreground characters and exquisitely concise backgrounds of literally pure color.<br /><br />Both author and artist are working at the peak of their skills melding together with the grace of great dancers -- each adding to the other to form a whole. I hope that this series continues to grow the purchasers for its individual issues to keep the TPBs coming out, but I prefer to partake of SAGA in the larger chunks which the TPBs provide. This is a graphic novel for grown-ups with a youthful sense of wonder. Begin here and be hooked.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It was an unexpected treat. It caused you to feel for each character including the husband. A good read. I disliked the husband but at the same time I felt bad for him and empathetic. The so called wife had me feeling sorry for but also irritated that she placed blinders on for all of his years of infidelity. I just wanted to spank the girlfriend and hug her dad. I would recommend this book.

0744014956|3.0|This guide is great for someone who is new to GTA and needs basic guidance on how to complete missions but other than that I am really disappointed at the lack of depth it provides.  The guide gives a very basic overview of the car, guns, main story missions, and side activities.  If you are trying to go for 100% completion it helps with where everything is and what is required.  However, there is a lot that is left out, like how the stock market works and any tips on how best to take advantage of the market, or when doing heists which team members you should pick and why.  Unlike most other game guides that give you some sort of overview of the online mode, there is no mention of it in here.  Overall if you love GTA and collect it's a good buy but if you want it purely for in-depth game break down you are better off going to a game walk through site and get in-depth walk through there.

B008JFUOVI|3.0|\\"Feels good to be out. Tell no one. I'll be in touch, Chow.\\" Two years after the events of Bangkok the wolf pack is settling back into normality. Normal for Alan (Galifianakis) is not taking his meds and buying giraffes. After the death of his father the group gets together to take him to rehab. While on their way they get stopped and are given an ultimatum. They must find Chow, who has stolen money from this man, or their friend Doug will die. I enjoyed the first Hangover but didn't go crazy over it like everyone else. The second one I didn't like mainly because it was just a remake and rehash of the same jokes. I was a little leery going in to this one because of that. This one actually has a different plot and that fact alone made it better then the second one. Rather then piecing together the events of the previous night this one is about the events the group gets into trying to catch Chow (who in my opinion is the best part of the series). This isn't really a review that will convince you to watch or not watch since it is the third in the series, but I will say that I really liked this one more then I expected. Overall, if you liked the first two you will love this. If you didn't like the second one you will like this. I give it a B+.
B00B23Z2IE|4.0|This was an album that came recommended by Amazon as something I might like, and I do. Charles seems to have slipped under the radar, and I'm very happy to have been introduced to his music. Soulful style, voice dripping with honey. Not an album for pushing the volume up too high, more for relaxed listening, and that's cool.
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|\\"He does not need a commanding officer, he needs a father.\\" 1,000 years from now the Earth is a dangerous place to live, overrun by animals who will kill humans on sight. While on the way back home the ship carrying Cypher (Will Smith) and his son Kitai (Jaden Smith) is hit by an asteroid and they end up crash landing on Earth. Cypher's legs are broken and he is unable to go to the rescue beacon. Kitai takes on the dangerous task of walking 100km to the beacon in an unfamiliar environment with everything he sees trying to kill him. I don't really know why but I was not looking forward to seeing this at all. I do like Will Smith but the movie just looked generic and boring. While the movie is nothing amazing and nothing I would watch again I did like it much more then I expected. I do also have to say that since Jaden Smith is the main focus of the movie the movie is geared toward the younger teen crowd rather then adults. Overall, better then I expected and if I was 20 years younger I would have really liked it. I give it a B.
B004JLDSIC|4.0|I bought this mostly based on other reviews. Lots of good songs here, well arranged, produced and recorded. Stacey's voice reminds me of Blossom Dearie, especially on a track like &#34;Surry with a Fringe on Top&#34;. That's by no means a criticism. This album is very enjoyable, mostly quite laid-back. What it lacks is a really high point or stand-out track. Good album late in the evening.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome, as always.  Can't wait for yet another.  King's just that, the king of modern fiction.  May he live many more years and write many more great books.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Loved Season 1 & 2 so I knew that I would love Season 3 and I did!  Masterpiece Classic does a wonderful job!
B005F2BBLK|3.0|This movie is okay.  The animation style is &#34;ugly.&#34;  All the creatures, even ones that are cute in real life are made into an &#34;ugly&#34; style.  A lot of the concepts in this movie are above children's heads.  I'm not sure what audience this movie is aimed at. . . it's just weird.

B00ESY7QXI|3.0|As you can imagine, the book is better. It's a nice take on it but I would still go with the book.
B0039Q7QKE|3.0|This is not nearly as acceptable as a version that would be used on screen but it is an accurate replica and works well from a distance. The pins may be hard to connect / break easily but if you're looking for something just to use as a display, it is very good.

030758836X|1.0|Sorry, I did not like this book. It went on & on. The descriptions and adjectives reminded me of an English Lit major trying to impress her professor. I have to admit I skimmed most of the middle of the book just to get through it and then read the last few chapters. I could not handle all of the dialogue. The plot was interesting, but too strung out. I think she should stick to short stories!!
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|A nice fun movie to watch with the family. I enjoyed all the video game references of the past, my childhood.
0061950726|3.0|There were some wonderful parts to this novel but I expected so much more after reading all the reviews.<br /><br />The story shifts between two main characters in alternating chapters.  One is written in first person and the other in third.  The two women's backgrounds are very similar in that they were both foster children, moved around quite a bit, and faced many hardships.  I must say that I kept mixing up their backgrounds.  Niamh/Vivian's tale was extremely moving and told an important and little known part of American history.  With the title being as it is, I agree with another reviewer that it was unfortunate that only a small amount of the novel was focused on the orphan train itself.  However, I do understand the author's point in that the random acts along the train helped to shape Niamh.<br /><br />Without giving away the ending, my main complaint with the story was the uncharacteristic act of Vivian's.  I felt very strongly that Niamh/Vivian would never have done what she did.  For so many years she had longed for a home and her \\"giving away\\" act made no sense in the person she had become, no matter how grief-stricken she was.  Towards the end, the plot became predictable, and very \\"Hollywood\\". I was cynical in that I felt the author sacrificed staying true to Niamh/Vivian's character for the benefit of having a moving conclusion.

1478952725|4.0|Writers like Malcolm Gladwell are by no means geniuses. They don't overturn tables and present totally new ways of thinking. But what Gladwell does here, is provide a framework for non-conventional thinking.<br /><br />The meat of the book is the notion that, what we tend to think of as advantages and disadvantages, can turn out to be completely wrong. I'll freely admit that the cases and people presented in this book are all over the map. To some this may appear to be a completely disconnected set of circumstances, and come away confused. But there is a thread that runs through the book if you're willing to set aside your preconceptions. Gladwell makes a case for non-conventional solutions to certain problems, some of which are optional, and some of which are thrust upon the central character. He points out that this method of going about life is not necessarily easy, nor is it obvious.<br /><br />Whether you buy into Gladwell's ideology at all turns out to be irrelevant. The most important outcome for me was when I came away from the book, my head buzzing with concepts that, while seemingly obvious, really weren't. I now find myself questioning some of my preconceptions, and I have a taste for more wayward thinking. As an \\"eye-opener\\", I found this book to be very valuable. Is it scientifically scrupulous? I don't know, and it probably isn't since it's intended as a pop culture tome and not a serious study of anything in particular. Whether one finds value in this work is really dependent on the reader.

B003SH9ROC|5.0|If you like good stories that have some meat to them, this one may be for you.  Take some time to enjoy your book because it's the beginning of a three part series and I can tell you the other two are also good.  Then later she has other books, that while separate, are also parts of the original story.  Enjoy!

There are some that still take after the inherent madness in the book. It is convenient that the book is in one volume. The black cover is very appropriate.
B0036T31YY|3.0|I'd give the movie triangle 3 out of 5 stars but it had the potential to be a 4 star film only if the lead actress mellissa George had solved the problem on the ship and realtered the events which happened. sadly the director did not go that route in the film. therefore it was an ok film. Triangle only if I were your director then people would have loved you

B008RA3X5E|1.0|I purchased this alarm clock because I could read the numbers upon awakening, even without putting on my glasses.  The app performed okay, just okay. I much preferred Alarm Clock Xtreme which has a wider range of options. Sadly it doesn't have an option which would allow one to increase the numeric display. I used Xtreme for three months before buying My Alarm Clock which I used once before going back to using Alarm Clock Xtreme. Yeah, the list of music you can select as a 'ringer' is impressive, better snooze options AND you can select from several options which will prevent you from just hitting dismiss while not fully awake yet.<br /><br />I had no intention of writing a review for My Alarm Clock. I didn't think it was awful, I just preferred the app I had started with. That changed when I downloaded Outlook to my Kindle Fire HD. Outlook  immediately identified My Alarm Clock as Malware. The app can access your sensitive data and send it to the developer.  I had already switched back to my other alarm clock because of the options now I know I won't be switching back to this one.  I would rather put on my glasses, or squint, than have an underhanded developer helping himself to anything he wants from my devices.<br /><br />Amazon does a much better job than Goggle Playstore when it comes to weeding out malicious software...but better isn't perfect. Of my 301 apps, Outlook found two which contained malware. That number could have been higher but I was warned away from other problems by reviewers who had downloaded apps, only to be warned of the malware by Outlook. A high number of the apps with the malware have been FAOTD at one time or another! A little more diligence seems to be called for before Amazon accepts programming. At the very least, as a final check, Amazon should download Outlook, or another reliable security program, to a Kindle Fire and then download all submitted software on that device. If it triggers a warning that software should not be available for download through the Amazon App store.  Say Amazon, is anybody listening?for download through the Amazon App store.  Say Amazon, is anybody listening?
B000FC12L4|5.0|It's been my favorite book since elementary school. It's such a well-balanced read and the character development is something to be desired in many other series. I recommend that anyone and everyone reads Sabriel and Abhorsen as well as Lirael.
0763644765|4.0|There are a lot of cute potty books.  This is one of them.  Now, if it only came with a guarantee to work!?!?
0618918248|2.0|Very repetitive book. It mentions a lot of things that most informed people already know about it and it is far from original in its thinking. It's success is merely due to good timing. Strange how a lot of people use science to negate religion and they just stop there. To negate an idea, especially when it tries to answer the basic fundamentals of life and existence, you need to offer an alternative that answers the basic questions the negated idea tried to explain. Science has most of the answers (although a lot of things still remain unresolved) and this book fails to address them.<br /><br />The story that religion failed and caused a lot of harm in human history is too old for today's more informed audience in the internet age. We need more books that have a technical angle to them especially if they wish to elevate science to to the top of the human thought process; like Ray Kurzweil's: The Singularity is Near- When Humans Transcend Biology.
B00F2P8ZDC|5.0|Prefect movie for the little ones.  My daughter watched it over and over.  Plus she can watch it on her iPad when we are out.

B0027MJU00|3.0|I enjoyed the book, but I found myself constantly falling asleep during the first 3/4 of the the story.  Even though I wanted to keep reading, the cadence or something of the writing kept lulling me to sleep.<br />A bit disappointed in the ending.

1576875776|5.0|In 1996 I was helping my friend at his stall in the Evanston Farmers Market in Evanston Illinois. The market was on Sat. morning, I would see this very odd woman,Vivian Maier. I had no idea who she was or what she did however she was a standout in the crowd, very different in dress and bearing. She looked like a spy from a 1940's B noir movie. When she came to our stall I always wanted to make a photograph of her. I am a street photographer however she had an aura and I didn't want to mess with her.She once asked me if something was wrong I didn't know what to say. Get the Book you will not be sorry.

B00F91RYL8|4.0|I always like to see originality in Hollywood and this was a new spin on Zombie movies. Brad Pitt is great as usual, this time playing a semi-vulnerable hero. Good ending and fast paced throughout.
B000W23H8S|5.0|I knew what I was getting with this MP3 purchase and I'm not disappointed.  There are some classic Police songs and a couple of bonus songs - &#34;Murder by Numbers&#34; being one that I particularly like.  I can recommen this to anyone who likes the Police or Sting.
B00EI6E17A|4.0|I've had mixed feelings about this artist Gaga is definitely talented & has made some great songs Applause being one of them<br /><br />That said sometimes her over the top dramatics are a bit distracting from her music but in the end all that really matters in terms of music to me is the song over all<br /><br />I like what I like & nothing else matters beyond that because a good song is a good song it could be an artist I'm completely annoyed with but if that artist can make me dance, think, & enjoy the moment I don't care about any of the other stuff<br /><br />I don't allow public opinions or even my own personal views about an artist stop me from enjoying a great song though sometimes it's not always easy to ignore the things that annoy me about an artist but like I said in the end all that matters is great music.
B000JG9ZXI|5.0|If you are an Alfred Hitchcock fan then this movie needs to be in your collection. Cary Grant and Grace Kelly really make this movie great. I put this up there with Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest. I'm glad I own it.

B00FJTYDKK|2.0|My recommendation is to just watch the trailer a couple times instead of watching the movie. It has all the funniest parts in it.<br /><br />This movie felt very manufactured and unoriginal to me. It's like the \\"cool guy\\" from How to Train Your Dragon in an Avatar-esque world except that he is only a prop for this odd family that is obsessed with caves and being afraid of stuff. I think the main character is the sister but I'm not sure. Add to the mix a lot of big facial expressions and voice inflection to really fit that animated movie stereotype.<br /><br />They did try to make it meaningful. The moral of the story is that every sunrise can mean a better day than the last and it ties the beginning and end together but again feels manufactured, like that's something a good story should have so let's make up a moral to tie it all together, or something.<br /><br />Sorry Dreamworks, not very good.<br /><br />Also, there is excessive motion blur on everything. I don't mean to be negative, it's just true.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Simple to play and relaxing as well. I would definitely recommend it for all ages.<br /> Love this game! It is really a &quot;simple pleasure&quot;!
B00CXQL828|5.0|Superb super group. Awesome playing, singing, and songwriting. Catchy songs with shredding guitar solos and probably one of the best rhytm sections seen in rock music scene.

B003L77FYS|5.0|Castle and Beckett are so perfect together. I love the way the show is about serious subjects, but still injects humor into the storylines. Nathan Fillion wouldn't ever have to say a word; his facial expressions say everything. A cliffhanger ending meant I impatiently waited all summer for the fourth season to begin. I'll definitely buy all the seasons of Castle to add to my DVD collection!

B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Great book to read and be entertained, but as I often feel with gladwell his claims are very debateable.<br /><br />Gladwell is a tricky writer, he is very good at bringing the reader to see his claim for more than it actually is. For example, if you really break it down the entire section on \\"desirable difficulties\\" is nothing more than a fancy version of the old saying \\"what doesnt kill you (might) make you stronger\\". Nothing new, and not that interesting or controversial, but Gladwell presents it in a way that makes you think its something new.<br /><br />Same with the chapter on inverted U curves. All that boils down to is the common sense notion that too much of a good thing is usually bad. This is not new, but Gladwell is good at making you feel as though he has said something profound. Reader beware and REALLY think about what you read.
0307474259|5.0|Lots of good information---given in terms you can understand, but also scientific enough to know you're given factual information.  Interesting photos, too, from decades ago.  Generally, we need to improve what we are putting in our mouths...sugar is way too large a part of our average consumption habits and it's killing us slowly.  Read this book.  Make your own, informed decisions on how to eat.  What you do know can help you.

0312853238|5.0|There are very few books within science fiction that are as hyped up as \\"Ender's Game.\\"  Since its publication in 1985, readers have proclaimed the novel as one of the best, if not THE best, SF novel ever written.  Sometimes the novel itself can get lost in the fray.  With that being said, \\"Ender's Game\\" is truly one of the great ones, a novel of extraordinary power that is among the best the genre has to offer.  Written at a time where Card was at the top of his game and he could do no wrong (both on paper and in life), he produces a book that takes on the familiar SF theme from war fiction - war as seen through the eyes of a soldier - and reframes it so that the story is told through the eyes of a child.  Not only that, but the child is the war's central figure.  It is not merely about the loss of innocence, as much as inevitability, irony, deception and the purposeful destruction of innocence in the fantastical pursuit of a misguided higher ideal.<br /><br />In the futuristic world of \\"Ender's Game,\\" an alien race known as the buggers has attacked Earth twice and almost destroyed mankind.  To prepare for the next encounter, an international Battle School has been established, where the world's most talented children are drilled in the arts of war.  Their early training takes the form of \\"games,\\" which are basically simulated battles in null-gravity.<br /><br />Enter Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin: a genius amongst geniuses. The International Fleet originally had its sights set on Ender's big brother and sister Peter and Valentine.  But when it became clear that neither of them were what they were looking for, the I.F. decides that Ender may just be the individual they need to win the bugger war.<br /><br />Separated from his family before he is seven years old, Ender is sent to Battle School where he quickly establishes himself as a natural.  He excels immediately, and becomes commander of his own platoon ridiculously early.  But Colonel Graff, commanding officer of the Battle School, is grooming Ender, pushing him right to the limits of endurance.  It would seem that Graff is playing games too, and Ender is merely a pawn.<br /><br />The I.F. is clear about their agenda: fight the buggers.  What they aren't clear about are their methods.  The more Ender advances in his command, the more it becomes clear the Battle Schools games have no rules at all, or none that can't be changed completely.  Ender's Game examines the ethics of power and the role sheer manipulation can play in forming the cultural and political landscape people live in. Both in the Battle School, and in an interesting -- and astoundingly prescient -- subplot where Ender's siblings Peter and Valentine (both of whom are as much prodigies as he is in their own way) compose for their own amusement pseudonymous political essays on the web that end up having more influence worldwide than they could've dreamed of, Card explores how easily and unwittingly people can find themselves played. And even when you are aware of it, how difficult it can be to do anything about it.<br /><br />\\"Ender's Game\\" works from its first page to its last.<br /><br />Five Starsattle School, is grooming Ender, pushing him right to the limits of endurance.

B000HZGNEU|5.0|Since the first time I viewed this movie, I've been tickled by the humor and fun of the whole scenario of future travelers coming to 20th century earth.  I laugh each time I see Scotty picking up the mouse and politely addressing the computer.  I adore Spock and his use of colorful and inappropriate language or when Kirk explains Spock's weird-ness by claiming he had used 'LDS'.  Hope you enjoy it...it's a classic and in my opinion, the most fun of the movie series.

B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Loved this movie.  Want a sequel.  Best movie effects and actor success in tricks that I've seen in a while.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|It provide useful tips to talk to others. Especially for foreigner.<br />It makes me more comfortable to talk to friend.
1609611543|5.0|Lots of interesting data and recipes. It's interesting that so many people have these &#34;sensitivities&#34;, and I was really interested by the possible effects of foods on people with ADD and ADHD.
0062107143|5.0|Bernard Cornwell has brought historical figures back to life in an imaginatively believable way.  He has a knack for making human the mythic personae of our history books and of placing them in settings that we ourselves are invited to enter into.  He is an excellent story-teller.
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|Very cool, loved the music, each song was a little different, it was great to listen to in the truck
0439023521|5.0|I love a good post-apocalyptic action/drama. I love it when the author includes details in the plot that hark back to our world/time, for example when the characters find an \\"ancient\\" item and wonder what on earth we used it for and then find a new and usually weird use of their own for it. I liked that Collins didn't shy away from the action, didn't try to blunt it and make it bloodless - it's an action movie in a book - there's supposed to be ACTION and fighting and blood. Without proper action scenes and a little gruesomeness the book would lose a lot of its appeal (and they probably wouldn't have made a movie of it either). I would give the book a rating of 16+ due to the violence, I don't think anyone under the age of 16 should watch a movie like this, so they shouldn't read a book like this under the age of 16.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|The graphics are amazing and the bonus rounds are challenging. Playing the &#34;Pork&#34; side is fun. I highly recommend it.
0060873175|3.0|I enjoyed the plot and the idea, but found the writing a bit weird and irritating. I didn't like the way the characters were named using their first and last names, every time they were mentioned. I read their names so many times I'll still be able to remember them in a month. I was surprised by only one of the deaths (I don't want to spoil it completely, so I won't give the name), the rest of them were pretty predictable. The techno-speak was a little hard to understand, especially explaining the shrinking process. A previous comment mentioned being able to tell when Crichton's voice stopped and Preston's started. If Crichton was the one who used the full names of all the characters so excessively, then I actually liked Preston's writing better, it seemed to be more concise and flowed better.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|Loved the book. Funny and we'll written. Story was vet interesting. A good ending. Would recommend the book to anyone.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is a fun read and did 2 of the exercises so far...and guess what? Got results. If the LOA seems to be skipping by you give this book a try. (I will doing the rest of the experiments in the coming weeks.)
B00785P2QC|4.0|Very good I recommend this because it has good graphics and all bad news is that it is really really really really really really good
B005HEVBGG|5.0|This is one of my favorite of the franchise.  I've seen it several times.  Quality of the picture was very good.
B0064UPU4G|4.0|I've only heard a few songs from Daft Punk, and enjoyed what I heard so I decided to check out this album. There are some good songs on here, and now I have some new favorites.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|Great picture, sound and stream. We had no issues with this movie. This was a classic I had always wanted to see. Loved it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Very good overview about battery and good options for recharge and optimalization.  You can see how many percent you have in certain moment wich is mising in basic interface.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I would recommend that everyone read this book. Young women should read this book because it will give them insight on how they may be holding themselves back or how our culture doesn't encourage them in professional leadership roles as much as men. Mothers should read this book because they will see how we treat girls differently than boys. And professionals should read it to identify ways to push themselves and work to encourage women in the workforce.<br />I read this book for a book club and we had a great discussion.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|This Jack Reacher book is excellent and has one of the best endings of all the books.  Lots of twists and plot lines.  Great Reading.
B000QCS8UQ|5.0|Great read! Definitely would recommend to anyone who loves science and horror. Very good mixture of the genres. And provokes interesting thought and insight.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have to say in all honesty. This is your best work ever in joining two novels that completed the story as it should.  I am so happy I bought this novel!  I know I will read it again, just as I did with the Shining.  Thank you for a wonderful novel.  A master piece I might add.<br /><br />Tari
B00BSBR9N6|2.0|The idea of the book was interesting and the plot was unexpected. I didn't like the writer's take on Asperger's syndrome. It felt as though the author read a lot a outta e syndrome, but didn't actually talk to a living, breathing Aspie.<br /><br />No Aspie would behave as Don, the main character in this book. For instance, Don goes on a journey to change his social behaviors, and he does so seamlessly and easily. In practice, this process takes years, not days.<br /><br />This book could have been great had the author researched Asperger's a bit more.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|This novel is on simmer for 300 pages. Classic Jack Reacher, complete with wrong conclusions and obvious mistakes by Jack. But it doesn't disappoint. Thanks Lee!
B00F8GYC1Y|4.0|My 9 year old has been waiting for this to come out and absolutely loved it.  The only problem is that he was able to beat all the levels so quickly there was nothing left to do after a day.  Now he is anxiously awaiting the levels that are &#34;coming soon&#34;
B009RX7WTI|5.0|This series just keeps getting better.  I was actually concerned about where it could go once the original characters finished their residency and how they could maintain interest as several of them left the show over the years.  I need not have worried.  The standards by and for this show have been held at the constant high level we have come to expect.  If you are one of the few who don't like the show or have never seen it, I am not going to put out any spoilers, except to say the indications are strong that there will be an eleventh season!  The only sad thing is I have to wait another year before I can own season ten.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|My 9 year old son absolutely loves all these books.  He is anxiously awaiting the next book to come out now!
