B005PK57IK|4.0|I definitely wish Amazon had season 4 for free on Amazon Prime. I am definitely ready to watch the next season after season 3.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I wasn't even sure that I wanted to read this book in the first place, but was immediately taken in once started.  It is a moving story.  I loved the unique perspective of the narrator.  Even if you are not a dog lover, you will enjoy this book.
B005SE9W9I|5.0|I love 24. This was a great season and i love the way things ended. Jack is one of my all time favorite people
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I was told that this collection will grab you from the start and one will have a hard time putting it down. Well, I am midway through book 3 in this set and, to date, I can totally attest to this comment.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app and if you have seen Despicable me2 or the first movie of it then you will enjoy!!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Fun game. Some are easy, some can stump you at first. And you know once you play you'll start wanting to make up your own.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|Right out of the box I was extremely impressed by the build quality of the unit. When you pick it up for the first time you automatically feel like you own a high quality item.Set up was quick and easy - no issues at all. Took about 5 minutes to set everything up and install drivers. Right when i started playing music you can tell the quality is 10000x better. You do not need to train your ear for that \\"slight difference\\" in quality. Highly impressed thus far for the price (I purchased it for 149.99 @ local retailer) Now the only problem I have with this unit. The dials. They make the whole unit feel like something you bought from the dollar store. They actually feel like garbage. They feel loose and are hard to grip. I'd take down another star, but the build & sound quality are too good.
0345529057|5.0|I am of the Harry Potter generation - the books were coming out all through elementary and middle school. So I grew up being almost EXCLUSIVELY interested in those. And then the movies started coming. I had no interest in fiction books, but forced myself to try and start again (for example, I tried a &#34;Dexter&#34; book that the show is based off of and it was laughably pretty bad). I, like millions of others, was hypnotized by the show (after starting to watch it mid-way into the third season, so I had some catching up to do). But with my history of Harry Potter, I knew that the books are always better. So, this summer, I made it my goal to finish these four books. Having been awfully sick, I didn't have much choice to sit on my couch and plug away at them. But I would do that even if I wasn't sick - they're doubly more hypnotizing then the show. I really can't over-exaggerate the purely masterful story-telling, the unusually rich and thick back-story of civilizations and humanity that is created that this story follows after, and maybe most of all - to those millions that flocked to this series after the show came out - how amazingly different from the screen the story in this book is. I mean, Tywin was never at Harrenhall, Jon sees giants at Mance's camp, and Robb doesn't marry that sexy foreign girl (or I guess he does kind of, but not THAT one).<br /><br />I have had NO problem with the spines opening or the pages being incorrectly numbered (more than half-way into the 3rd right now). These books could be a little taller because reading the first and last third of the book sometimes is a headache because the weight of the pages in your hand is a little off. But I can hardly complain.<br /><br />Bottom line: this experience at this price leaves no one the option but TO buy this. My only regret is that I'll be too old and out of college before some classes are crafted on this epic.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|The talking dog is too funny. My godson loves this game. It keeps him busy for hours. He loves to play it every time he turns on the Kindle Fire HD.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It entertained me for hours. Good puzzles, hidden objects and story line. There were helpful hints that I could choose to use or not use. On days that I was brain fried, I would use them...got too hooked to not play on those days. When I was up for a challenge, I would stop using the hints. I hope there is a sequel.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's really awesome I love to take care of my horse...and when I say I love it, I mean I REALLY love it!!!!<br />And it seems like my horse is really REAL:)
B008BU75IQ|5.0|For some reason, I thought that the Clifton Chronicles was a trilogy...making Best Kept Secret the final where all of the characters are wrapped up in a very neat package.  Obviously, I was wrong.  Mr. Archer knows when he has a good thing going.  I can't wait for the next book.  Archer is perhaps the world's best storyteller.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|The movie is too long, but I appreciated its sense of humor. And Chris Hemsworth is nice to look at!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Tears filled my eyes when I finished reading this book! Is that a good thing? Yes - because the characters were so real and I felt so much compassion for them. Well done!!
B009B8YZIK|5.0|FINALLY!<br />I have been waiting for this for who knows how long?<br />The only complaint I have is, WHY ISN'T THERE MORE?!
B009LQKHIO|2.0|This was a good book; however, it contains strong language & very explicit sex. The book would have been better w/o either. Please reconsider reading this book.  :(
0452295548|5.0|My mom had a stroke like event 2 months ago. This book has been worth its weight in gold for us during recovery! HIGHLY recommend for anyone who finds themselves in the same type of situation.  Caregiver or patient!!!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Sometimes number 2 isn't as good as the first.... But as always Sylvester Stallone does not disappoint! Awesome action packed movie!
B00CSJYYO4|3.0|Difficult to undestrand. and saw no relations to real life unless you are a philosopher or a master in metaphysics
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great graphics..good game play .. been playing it almost non stop since downloading two days ago. Will be watching for more of there games.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|If your a purveyor of Disney films, then this anime is for you.<br />Its not like Disney really, but it is definitely a fun Family film, for the family about family.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|this app keeps my android phone and kindle fire running fast and not bogging down like it did before.<br />so far I think it is working very well for whet I wanted to use it for.
B005Z6YHEY|5.0|This book is very thought-provoking. I found it helped a lot to understand the the complexity of the human brain.
B00C1C0WCQ|4.0|To my surprise, this second film in the Jurassic Park series was more enjoyable than the first. More action, less downtime, and a good performance by Jeff Goldblum. Recommended.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I watch this movie now and again, what a great cast , and story based on fact by Henry Hill( Recently passed away)
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|very fun game but when I try to grow the regular rate plant it doesn't register that I'm growing it so it's not letting me finish the missions where they're needed please fix!
0765367297|4.0|Enjoyable sci-fi book even if you dont know much, or anything, about the Halo games and universe.<br />As this deals with where Master Chief comes from, it can server as a great intro into the first game itself.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|If I had taken time to check the Internet I could have found this exact same information on their website.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|I was given this book by the author in return for an honest review.<br /><br />This is a harrowing story of what minorities at the hands of Hitler and others during the Second World War.<br />I found this a real heart breaking tale following the trials and tribulation's of the \\"Weissensteiners\\"  and how they overcome everything that came their way!!!<br />Although this was a work of fiction this was a truly inspiring read and I would place this as high up as \\"Schindler's Ark\\".<br />This author had got details and character's just right!!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Another brilliant novel by John Green! It was beautifully written, thought-provoking, and so real. Thanks for a good laugh and a good cry, John!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|written by an author who has read a good deal of fantasy.  He writes the story he would like to read.
B004LROUNG|5.0|He keeps us, as usual, sitting up all night as you just can´t put the book down.<br />Very funny in parts and not so lengthy on description as in some of his former novels.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Seriously could not put this book down.  Loved the twists and turns, though [SPOILER ALERT] I wasn't thrilled with the way it ended!!! So many questions left unanswered!  Totally worth it though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves this game because it gives her entertaining when she's bird she can play it.<br />Another way I like it is that it is free.<br />My daughter does not ever regret buying it!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I got mine already. It sucks. It is constantly buffering no matter what, even at 480p. I have 10 other devices in the house that NEVER buffer. This thing plays 5 seconds, buffers for 10, plays 5 seconds, buffers for 10... It took 30 minutes to watch a 5 minute youtube video. Don't bother. Plus, this gives google direct revenue, and we all know they work for the NSA now, so......<br /><br />I'd go back in time and not buy this, and I got mine right away in the mail. The truth is, an hdmi cable from your PC is a way, way better option.<br /><br />Another frustration? Google Play music won't play side-loaded music on the chromecast. So if you want to hear the bootleg of your band from last Friday's show: No. In the year 2013, they released a media sharing device that is incapable of streaming mp3s WITHOUT VIDEO. Please explain this. I'll not be buying google hardware again.<br /><br />Oh, one more thing, somebody jailbroke this thing and got root and started playing with it so, you know, someday somebody might be able to USE the piece of shit for something, and they released an update to kill the root exploit right away.<br /><br />Basically: Google is evil now. The Chromecast is a Google product all the way, and not only that it sucks and doesn't provide the advertised functionality, and even specifically UNINCLUDES many basic features you would expect in a device like this that would've cost maybe $5 of development time to implement?<br />One other thing: No SD card slot. I'm sick of Google not including SD card slots. I don't want your ghey cloud, I want to copy 50 movies from wherever I want, and then, you know, WATCH THEM. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE NERVE OF ME?!?!<br /><br />F Google. F them in the A.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Not literally real but this book showed a protagonist who wasn't a knight in shining armor hero but a real hero who makes real mistakes that he accepts real consequences for.  A lot of times with the heavy action books there will be your everyday plots and schemes but after the end of this first book (which tied a couple loose ends up) you can see that we have barely scratched the surface.<br /><br />There is so much going for this series and I can not wait to find out what happens next. Get this book you will not regret it.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|What is the point of a help guide when the game isn't available in the app store? I wish I had chosen a different tablet.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Who doesnt love pac-man? hm? I love it!! Thank you for adding this as an app for my kindle fire!! love it! love it love it love it!!!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have loved basically everything about Neil Gaiman's writing since I first started reading him and his new novel does not disappoint at all. The writing is incredible, and the author takes risks that I wasn't expecting to see in a book supposedly for adults, but it all works out perfectly in the end. Don't pay attention to reviewers who complain about the book being too short - it is short, yes, but it's the perfect length for the story and I'd still call it a good value for the money. I'm all over the place with this review because I've literally just finished this book and I'm slightly emotional with how amazing it actually turned out to be. Read it. Now. Right now.
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|This movie had two things going for it: 1. I didn't waste $11 to see it in the theater and 2. I was able to rent it on amazon and saved some money in the process.
B007N85POS|5.0|Some of the levels are really challenging but if you look at it logically you can usually find a way to accomplish the goals.  The graphics are great.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is amazing you can breed dragons and you can mix the breeds of dragons. You need to get this game NOW!!!!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|One of the best TV series of all time - brings so much to life, including his car, his jacket and cigars. Great bedtime TV.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Once it gets rolling, Gaiman gives us a story that entertains and borders reality so well that I reflected on the gray memories of my own youth.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Get it!!!  Get it!!!  Get it!!!  It is the best game of the century, in my opinion,and you need to get it.  I got dream land or whatever it is called and I can't stop playing it.
B008LV8TSU|3.0|This book is exactly what I expected it to be. It was fun, easy to read, and easy to come back to between books. Sometimes you just need to give your mind a little rest after a particularly taxing book and just go along for the ride. This book does that. It's fun. If you need a quick easy story that's entertaining this will do it.
B005J2UM9S|2.0|With the 4-star review I was hoping this would actually be good, but it's just as annoying as the real ghost shows where supposed experts (who should be more accustomed to ghosts than the rest of us) nearly crap a brick every time a floorboard creaks. The acting was decent, but its the over-the-top sound and in-your-face images intended to scare does absolutely nothing but annoy.<br />Every scene was predictable, so I don't suppose this is a spoiler alert to say the wheelchair, table, and bathtub scenes did nothing. Or the giant distorting screaming faces that have been done to death.<br />The only creepy scene was the arms coming out of the wall, when they GREW in size. Now that's daggum creepy.<br />You want a real scary ghost flick involving a wheelchair? Check out George C. Scott in 1980's The Changeling.
034580404X|2.0|I dont know whats all the fuzz about, total waits of time.<br />I even couldn't bring myself to finish the first book.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|I love Beverly Hills 90210 almost 10 years. It was interesting for me , and it is interesting for me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a really cool game. It's really addicting. If you like temple run you would like this game. It's like temple run but a little different and better
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I've read several books now about the personal experiences of our warriors in Viet Nam, Iraq, and Afganistan. Mark Owen's book was the first one that captured not only the job they do in service to our country, but just how elite these professional warriors really are, both in terms of skill level and what normal parts of life they must forego to maintain that level. A quick read and a great piece of history to know more about.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These have terrific quality.  That said, the open style is something to get used to, and I probably wouldn't recommend them as your only pair of headphones.  I live in New York City.  When I'm outside, I have to crank the volume up most of the way, and when a subway is coming I just can't hear anything.<br /><br />Oh, and when you're at home, sometimes other people hear things you don't intend them to hear.  Open goes both ways.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Bought this one from Google Play couple of weeks ago. Installation part is really easy. Its simple. It works great browser one devices (TV and Phone/Tablets).<br /><br />Few things not aware of before buying this product (its not a product's fault but liwife tions) :<br /><br />- You wont be able to share your screens/ photos/ videos from your cell phone.<br /><br />- You will have to have some minimum configuration on your laptop. (Mine is Core 2 Due- ancient one). So i was not able to run it on my laptop chrome browser.I won't be able to use it from my computer chrome browser<br /><br />- It didnt work with my Netflix app of my cell phone that runs Android 2.3. But it runs fine on my other phone Jelly bean versions 4.2 and 4.3.<br /><br />- My TV didnt have the USB, so i had to use the power cable.<br /><br />It's not a device like Roku or Google TV or Airplay. It has its own area. At this moment only two useful app works for me. Netflix and youtube. video quality of the product is good. wifi reception is also good. I tried Roku 3 on the same place. Roku 3 was unable to pick up wifi signal. This one worked great.<br /><br />update 02/20/2014<br />=======================<br />Got another one replace of the previous one. It is again working correctly. I do not know what will happen after a week. Will it dispense like crazy like previous- dont know.
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|The Scandinavians have a way of doing crime novels that is terrific.  Harry Hole is a man with problems, but it is still easy to like him and care about his work and his life.  Jo Nesbo has become one of my favorite authors, and I eagerly await his new novels.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|it is good for my son. He is very happy with it. It is very nice.. I recommend it to you..
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I enjoyed the story content.  Would be interested in how people who read the book thought about it.  Since I heard much about how it was filmed, I was especially interested in the &#34;how it was made&#34; clip......I was very much impressed but glad I saw the film first because it might have &#34;tainted&#34; the impact of some scenes.  The special effects are so good that in the future it will be hard to tell &#34;straight photography&#34; from animation.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Surprised how good BC was, actually all the actors did a great job. nice unexpected romantic kinda weird people movie. reminds me of my own family
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season took me through all emotions, ending in shock.  It was a very good story with excellent acting.  Can wait for season 4 to start.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I luv this dvd only 20min.. She really makes u work hard i will defenetly recommend it. Im buying the rest of these dvs..
B001NAT07A|3.0|It was a my favorites actress and she was fine in this movie but sharon stone was very cold and she was not vey good in this movie.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Aqualung, Thick As A Brick, Living In The Past -- all great albums. But Benefit is the first of the remarkable Tull era. It truly shows the diversity of music and styles and the complexity of Tull's music. (The somewhat bizarre &#34;backward flute&#34; on &#34;With You There To Help Me&#34; to a classic riff on &#34;To Cry You A Song&#34; to a lyrical &#34;Alive and Well and Living In&#34; he band presented a variety of styles.) With John Evan playinig keyboards the group was beginning to develop into one of the top bands of the 70s. I still wish instead of the playing Elton John's &#34;Rocket Man&#34; whenever an anniversary of man first landing on the moon comes around, someone would be creative and play &#34;For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me&#34; , Collins being the astronaut left circling the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin got to walk on the moon. It is the album which made me a Tull fan for life.
B008Y73940|3.0|I just felt the better part of this was on the cutting room floor. It was just a medium movie that was very predictable.
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|I like kitsch and there is eye candy for everyone. Good special effects and hopefully a sequel. end of review.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series, fabulous acting, appropriate and intelligent humor. An unvarnished look at the complicated relationship between the haves and have-nots.  I can't wait for the next season!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Full of twists and turns.  Couldn't put it down.  Just when you think you know what's going on something unexpected happens.  Don't miss it!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Ordered this item the first day it was released. I was really excited to try it out and I was going to give it as a gift but I never received the package. I'm not sure if it was the carrier that Amazon uses Ontrac 's fault or it was Amazon's, either way I don't have the item. Since Chormecast is backed up for 2- 3 months I will not get a hold of this item till then. This  was the first item I bought through Amazon and I've never experienced anything like this online. With my disappointment with the service, I will probably never be using Amazon again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game takes some thinking. I really enjoyed the challenge. I look forward to new rooms coming out. Have fun!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|I play it from time to time... it is ok... sometimes frustrating... sometimes annoying because the bonus money you pick up is so low it isn't even worth the effort... but it is what it is...
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I find Facebook to be probably the best social media sites out there.  I really enjoy it and have reconnected with people from the past.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Would like to get the GooglePlay App on my Kindle Fire HD so I could take it w/me to play Candy Crush Saga and Pet Rescue Saga w/my friends & family when I'm not home!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I really like this application. It works great and is easy to use. I recommend this application for your Kindle Fire HD.
0345525558|5.0|The book met my expectations and was easy to read.  I would recommend it to friends, and I already have.
B00A27X972|5.0|This story made me smile from beginning to end. It's the kind of book where you stop reading to read a great line to the person next to you.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I find Twitter to be an ok social media site.  Nothing bad about it, just not my cup of tea I guess.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like being able to stay in better touch w/family & friends. Also, like playing games, but would like to know how to sync them to my Kindle Fire HD!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow! This game is so much fun,for anyone of all ages! And I love it,and I enjoy it so much!(: I myself love it and it's worth having it on my Kindle Fire. But I will warn you that it does randomly download,and it does take its time!(: Anyway,I love and enjoy this game...and I hope that you enjoy it too! Now get this app,and HAVE FUN!
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|It was a great book that followed along in the Wheel of Time series......Just as good as the last one I read......
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a dramatic gateway to a new fantasy world, where the borders between life and death are more watery than in our own. The main character, Sabriel, is a bold female protagonist, who leads us on an unexpected journey with a sassy feline companion. The words are descriptive and enticing, the world inventive and deep. The exact opposite of your usual damsel in distress novel, it is an inspiration to children and teens who are so often inundated with passive female characters.<br /><br />I first read it in my early teens, and am now in my twenties, but the book still exerts a hold on me, so much, that it was one of the few books that made the cut when I moved internationally.<br /><br />While it is accessible to any fantasy lover, I strongly recommend it for older elementary students who are above their grade level in reading, and teens. The language is more advanced, but the subject matter is not objectionable for older elementary school children. Neither is the book too simplistic for adults. I suggest giving it to a child or teen you are related to, so you can steal it back for a peek once they have finished.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|great movie would recommend it to anyone young and old.  Good for the whole family. must watch.  Would watch again
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|It would be a lot better if I could download the Candy Crush Saga game on my kindle fire hd from my pc!
B009XWD02G|1.0|This app is the worst thing I have ever downloaded!!!!! I regret ever downloading this . I try to listen to a song but It just made a freaking darting sound! Take my advice and don't ever think about downloading this piece of carp.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|It was a great book that followed along in the Honor Harrington series......Just as good as the last one I read......
B00499QUK2|5.0|I only meant to watch one episode, but I couldn't stop. Any fan of Holmes will love this series - great chemistry between Holmes and Watson. Not only was there suspense - I actually had a few laugh out loud moments.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I have always loved doing jigsaw puzzles, and this is the best puzzle app I have come across. There are so many beautiful puzzles to choose from and the gallery is updated often. I absolutely love this app!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Great alarm clock, but I paid to release the ads from showing.  Still popping up on my Galaxy S2.  What's up with that?
B00499NHLC|5.0|A modern interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, clever and witty and thoroughly delightful. I watched all 6 episodes (season one and two) in two weekends. Perhaps I'm not a Holmes purist, but for me, it was more enjoyable than the two most recent theater releases. I look forward to the third season that begins on PBS this fall.
B00APAENUI|4.0|It was a great book that followed along in the Honor Harrington series......Just as good as the last one I read......
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|Have always loved this movie. Watched it with my mom years ago and was tickled to find it here to watch again. Very funny and sweet too :)
B004QPOVF0|5.0|This is the best DVD AC/DC has EVER put out. The sound is amazing and so is the video. A MUST have for any fan. I have watched it over and over. LOVE IT!!!!
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I wish I had purchased the Hd version without deleted scenes, but already have this movie on VHS and DVR. If i had it to do over, I would get the entire movie version in HD, but just nice to have this classic movie on my iPad.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Read reviews about it when it first came out, and thought it was simply amazing!  Can't wait to see it again.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I love this album.  It is the first album that I have ever loved every song on in my entire life. Be aware that there are expletives but the messages are far better than any other album containing curse words.
B0018PH3L0|4.0|I remember this movie from a long time ago.  I never saw it in it's entirety.  I liked it.  Came as a couple of DVD's and they worked fine.  Worth the cheap price.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I love movies with suspense, excitement, a twisted story, action, explosions, humor, AND a love story!  This has it all!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Beautiful shots, engaging story and characters, ghastly irony at the ending--unfair to do to viewers, but I eagerly await season 4.
B00005U122|5.0|One of my favorite DVD's!  I play this DVD at parties and everyone loves it!  I have purchased several copies to give to friends.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Great book by a strong woman. Loved that she was honest and open. Made me realize the show based on this book is VERY loosely based on it.
B007P7UF0G|1.0|I hate this movie.  The only time it was even remotely enjoyable was during the close ups of Franco Nero - OMG he's gorgeous.<br /><br />The first song Ms Redgrave sings sounds as if it were written for a teenage girl.  Redgrave was 30 at the time.<br /><br />The only person I could even remotely care about was Arthur.  I think I really like Richard Harris.  None of the other characters were likable or sufficiently fleshed out for me to want to know them or know more about them.<br /><br />My SO is still pissed off at me because I couldn't stop commenting on all the cheesy things that took place.  He liked it.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Not lIke previous novels, disappointing<br />It was confusing and difficult to follow<br />I did not enjoy this novel like the others by same author
B007STBUHI|5.0|After all these years. LOL<br />I don't know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your time reading this as I am my waisting time doing them a FAVOR with the minimum number of words they want on all reviews!!!!  Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth!!!!!!
B0001AUAU4|5.0|This is my first Carla Bruni CD, and I am now a fan.  Her vocals are quiet but strong, and a CD I have yet to grow tired of since June.
B003477DVK|5.0|My Dog Skip captivated us from its beginning to it send. It was well written and the acting was great.
B00355L2TU|5.0|This is a fantastic series of workouts for those wanting quick results and who are pressed for time. A word of caution, though...this will challenge you!
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|No stress and no big analysis, just play and relax at the same time. The graphics is wonderful and the screen effects are outstanding!<br />This is a game to have on your android device!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your time reading this as I am my waisting time doing them a FAVOR!!!!
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|My granddaughters like to help people so they like to help the people in the game would like more things to fix
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a fun game but I don't think it's going to hold my attention forever. Also, the whole barrel racing thing is silly. A little more accuracy would be nice.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is another in the series that  held my attention throughout the entire book.  I would recommend it to others.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Try to start out watching Season 1 and watch the entire series in order, but even if all you have is Season 3 you will be able to follow this amazing show very easily!  You will LOVE it.  Purchased this as a gift along with the combination set of Seasons 1 & 2 and it makes such a nice gift.  Amazon's prices are far below the cost of anywhere else.  Buy it now for yourself or as a gift and you truly will not be disappointed!  This is a series you will want to watch over and over!
B004MPRWJG|5.0|I don't know why they require more words on reviews? So I am waisting your time reading this as I am my waisting time doing them a FAVOR with the minimum number of words they want on all reviews!!!!  Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth!!!!!!
B00BTJMS1A|3.0|not enough instrutions on how to play need more cues and instrution to play and move forward with the game.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For the price you can't really go wrong unless you don't have a TV to plug it into, or WiFi to stream stuff with.<br /><br />This was easy to set up and works really well.  No lag or buffering, even in rooms where other wifi devices stutter and stall on Netflix.  Netflix HD is just lovely.  I bought one for every TV in the house, and one unused LED monitor also.<br /><br />Am completely happy with the purchase, would recommend.  I'm also excited about the other services that are coming.  Koushik Dutta has already written an app to stream all of your local media from any device in FullHD, and another for Dropbox - but is waiting for the release of the official software development kit to publish it.  It is going to get far more amazing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book held my attention from the moment I began reading it.  The development of the characters and storyline held me enrapt.  I recommend this book to others.
0688014291|5.0|This book tells the story of a man who has searched far and wide to discover the secrets of effective managers. He finds what he is looking for when he discovers the One Minute Manager. At first he is in disbelief, but after a couple encounters with the One Minute Manager himself as well as a few of his employees, he is convinced of this management style.<br /><br />The One Minute Manager manages in three ways:<br />-One Minute Goal Setting: set goals that can be reviewed in a minute or less<br />-One Minute Praising: immediate, genuine praise for things done right<br />-One Minute Reprimanding: immediate reprimanding for things done wrong, but still assuring the individual of their value<br /><br />Then the One Minute Manager explains why these methods work so well and the young man goes on to become a One Minute Manager himself.<br /><br />I found this book to be an easy read. It is a brief book with short pages and an interesting storyline. I really like how the principles are taught through a story in this book. I also like that at the end of each major principle, an outline is given to summarize what you just learned. Also throughout the books are brief quotes to help you remember what you are learning.  The management style itself sounds very effective and I think this book is a good tool for anyone in a management type position to study.
B002ABAGVU|5.0|Saw these guys at House of Blues Chicago in July and had to get caught up on the earlier albums.  Get them all!
B0091QS88K|3.0|Kids like it but I don't want to add to it and pay for a silly kid game so let kids add without cost.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|My wife woke up yesterday to witness me sobbing and tears streaming down my cheeks.  Highly unusual behavior for me.  Marcus and all his team are heroes that I hold in highest regard.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed book 2 as much as the first book in this series, and can't wait for the movie to come out.  I love the strength of the main character, Katnis and how she deals with challenges she has to face.  I recommend this book to others.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I had to set my Kindle to factory defaults to get rid of this stupid virus<br />I wish I wouldn't have got that virus
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|it was fun but the hard thing is its hard to control so upgrade that please people<br /> who made it
B000HF0J36|4.0|Okay, another movie about man altered super sharks.  But I like shark movies and this one did not disappoint me. Of course, the shark is smarter than a college professor and can logically figure things out, but the situation is somewhat more normal than most shark movies and the action is continuous. Besides, how can you not like a movie with LL Cool J as a cook.
B002BGFUPQ|3.0|This was my least favorite of the series because it doesn't really seem like it has alot to do with the main chacters.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love it so fun and cool to cool but could be better use a little more efort less money more dragons and that is it......
B00947NAHU|5.0|Loved the movie, lots of action, history, etc, a view into how Southern Plantations were managed and the hardships that slaves endured.
B009T3AE1Y|1.0|I think the idea was for the movie to appear deep.  It is pointless and pompous.  So much nonsense to overload the screen...
B006PZBRCY|5.0|There are no impurities in this movie...If you like robots, and you like boxing, then you will enjoy this moving.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|As an &#34;old&#34; Trekkie, from the Capt. Kirk days this was so great. I love how they worked off the original characters to explain where they came from without ruining the original story line.<br />My husband wasn't a Trekkie, but now he is!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Graphics and color are good. Game is fun and also makes you think. Its nice to play a game that has more to offer then just the mindless hidden object game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's awesome and I like the new purple minions and the doctor's  challenges and Meenas  cookie bots are awesome but grew is crazy for bananas
B00CLD65X0|3.0|Season 3 is I think definitely better than Season 2 but still not as good as Season 1.<br />The Bates story line is worn and just more baffling while Ms Crawley story line is starting to board on absurdity.<br />However the other characters and events outweigh these and still make for guilty pleasure viewing.
B002ZG9788|5.0|...and so of course I must give it five stars!  Maduesa is awesome in this movie and I just love Sam Worthington
B00APYKXFS|2.0|Starts at level 1 like level 15 of Galazer with no instructions. Bombs fill the sky from the very beginning. Might be OK for people with lightnig reflexes but it was &#34;Game Oveer&#34; for me before I got to Level 3. After a few tries, I was no longer interested.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best game I have ever played.it should be played by everyone who has a big imagination
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love how realistic and fun this app is. Highly recommend this to any horse lover. Even my 3 year old son enjoys playing.
B004K583KA|2.0|Why on Earth anybody would buy Rilling's performances of the complete cantatas, when there are several radically better recordings available these days??? One or two Rillings, carefully selected, I can understand, for purposes of thorough comparison. But! But! But! Rilling's conducting is turgid and unperceptive of Bach's larger concepts. The orchestra is murky and unstylish most of the time. The soloists are a mixed bag, some quite artful but some not quite tuneful. The chorus is an abomination. The recording technology is awful.<br /><br />The Gardiner &#34;pilgrimage&#34; recordings are immeasurably better. The Suzuki and Koopman complete sets are better by miles. Many of the old Leonhardt and Harnoncourt recordings (no, not all of them) are far more exciting. The best idea would be to skip the notion of a complete box of Bachs and to shop around for distinctive and thrilling performances of &#34;your favorite&#34; cantatas by various artists.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Truly one of my childhood favorites, so glad I decided to reread this as I needed to be reminded of its positive message.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps your interest by changing how things are hidden and what is required to acquire them. You will be looking forward to further levels just like all of the rest of us. Don't start a new level unless you have time to finish it as you will find it difficult to get it out of your head.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|I did not think it wss humanly possible to get so involved. I only care @ Walt & Jessie...& Mike...& Skylar...& Wslt Jr...& Marie & Hank.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hey does anyone know when the up for this game will come out for the kindle. Also I love this game so much.
B001XUYA0W|3.0|Mostly engrossing but very slow at times.  Too long -- a good 15 minutes could have been easily edited out.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love this game it's awesome I've only been playing it for a couple of days but I love it
B00005JGAB|5.0|Still as good as the first time! Every time I hear Joey sing my heart melts!! What a voice for the ages!!
0393061310|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend and although, I find that you have to break up the reading process because it is over whelming at times, I did find it very educational.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I downloaded this thinking it was the game. Afterwards I realized it says help guide..smdh..what do I need the help guide for when you cant even get the game itself?
B008JFUO36|2.0|I actually bought this movie,now to be fair,the story line was OK,the effects were very good,and had they used someone other than Tom Cruse it could have been great.As always Morgan Freeman held up his end.Cruse was flat.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I enjoyed the movie for a number of reasons.  I'd even watch it again and recommend it to you.  Enjoy!
0061339202|1.0|So this guys big hook is to prove \\"scientifically\\" that doing intrinsically rewarding activities frequently results in happiness?  Novel premise.  How out of touch with inspiration would one have to be in order to find this concept mystifying?  This revelation is completely trivial to those who do what they want in life already right now.  Millions of people who manage to structure their lives in ways where complications are minimized and favorite activities are maximized get to 'flow' all they want.  This means your Grandpa obsessed with his model train set, your smelly cousin on adderall who can't stop computer coding and the Dad down the street blissfully playing his Strat in the garage 16 hrs a day.<br />  You know.  People you five star reviewers would consider 'losers'.<br />  This 'flow' is not the magic key to some enduring, all pervading bliss that it's trumped up to be.  It's just people choosing to do what they like.  You reach out and take it, you don't apologize for it, you feel happy about it.  Then you pay the price like everything else in life.  No big deal.<br />  The price is that you must sacrifice things like a social life, status symbols, your favorite tv shows, external validation, your precious excuses, the comfort of being universally understood and all the other lovely things you're  too terrified to part with.<br />\\"You can't have your cake and eat it too\\" I hear you say.<br />\\"I could never be happy like these people because they have a characteristic unique to rare gifted butterflies called 'flow''.<br />  If you're rating this book 5 stars and rhapsodising about the magic of flow, it's time to admit that if any member of your family suddenly started 'flowing' you would call them \\"selfish\\" and try and stop the flow with all you got.  This 'flow' you like to moon over would horrify you if it visited you in waking life because who's going to pick up Billy from soccer when Mom is flowing her brains out on piano?  Face it, you're not wired for freedom.<br />  What this book is really all about is providing a fantasy for the cowardly.  It's something to fantasize about while living with the dull choices they made.  It's an excuse to hold up to avoid claiming your own fulfillment.  A simple concept inflated into mystical, unattainable ideal so you can go to sleep easy knowing you'll never have accept the responsibility for meeting your potential.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|It's been years since I saw this movie, but so much has happened in our world since then, I felt I needed to see it again.  Who can't relate to having had it up to here with all the crazy crap we have to deal with?
B001UGB1X8|4.0|Good acting with a great cast that has been hidden as a real gem of a movie. Strongly recommend it!
B007PKSN6Q|1.0|I ordered the rock of ages cd over a month ago. The payment came out right away and I have still not got my cd. I think that is horrible. It was suppose to be a present. I would like a refund or for u to actually ship my cd.
B0060D31N4|5.0|Taymor's TEMPEST is brilliantly cast, and the direction was flawless. The language is so well expressed that it is clear and without ponderousness. I will watch it again and again!
B001GCUER0|4.0|The one thing I didn't like about this series was I felt there was too much sex or suggestions of sex, but I really enjoy the period part with the great costumes from the 60's.  It was a trip reflecting on the mindset we were in during that period.  Love Jon Hamm, he is so perfectly cast.  All in all quite well done, the entire production.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is a rivetting story, full of  pearls of wisdom and well written. I personnaly do not enjoy the comments incerted by Oprah and her staff in the Kindle version, especially since my unit was not working well in returning from the Oprah highlights to the text.<br />It should be suggested reading for Highschool students and deffinitely on college lists.<br />There is much to think about and not only a page turner.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Keeps my kids interested, and they seem to have fun with the  game. The only thing they wish that it would do would do is regenerate coins faster.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is a sitcom I used to watch as a kid.  Just as funny now as it was then. Love John Cleese!
B0043EV774|5.0|I was so happy with the quality of the 3D disk,<br />and the whole thing looked brand new.<br />Thank you to the seller for the awesome deal :-)<br /><br />SO WORTH IT!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I like the game but think it's unbalanced in coins for each correct answer. Since it costs 15coins for a hint, the reward for a correct answer should be more like 5 coins. Spending 15coins equals 15 correct answers being wiped out. Some of the pictures take a hint to solve. Plus you can't advance without getting the right answer so the game gets put on the cloud.
B002MCYWHG|2.0|One was being fitted on another persons bike at the bike shop near me (not sure why - it looked easy enough to install yourself). I tested it out and I believe this product should work for it's intended use (flat, smooth riding surface free of obstacles and NOT around road traffic). This would be good for a simple stroll around the neighborhood - as long as you live on paved roads that aren't hilly.<br /><br />Notes:<br />- Good build quality.  Seemed sturdy. Mounting/dismounting a child would also be quite easy, provided you are able to straddle the top tube of the bike with the metal bracket installed.  If you can't do this, getting the child in/out could be slightly more awkward. You would probably have to put the wheel between your legs to stabilize the bike and so you could have 2 hands, and then swing around while keeping the bike upright.<br /><br />-The design makes it hard to perform quick maneuvers on the bike as your turning radius is reduced (I am 5' 11\\" riding a 19\\" bike with an average build). This could be improved by installing wider handlebars. The tray also obstructs some of the view from right in front of you. I would imagine it could be worse with a larger child in the seat.  Not a big deal when you're going quickly as you tend to watch further out, however, it felt strange not being able to see my tire when I was going slowly over/around an obstacle. Also, I highly doubt the padded tray would provide any protective function in a crash...  It's padded, but not padded enough to absorb any sort of impact. It looked like the tray could be removed even, I would consider that a plus as I don't think it would even be a good idea to have a sleeping kid on the carrier (going back to the point that this is a recreational device, not necessarily used to commute).<br /><br />-It's difficult to stop quickly or while going down hill.  Braking hard made it feel like the bike could flip forward (due to the additional weight being placed so far forward). That was with 30lbs, the effect may not be as noticeable with less weight. After a few tests I was able to somewhat counter the effect by shifting my own weight backwards off the saddle and over the rear tire, however, this further reduced maneuverability.<br /><br />- Front suspension forks will likely need to be adjusted when the wee ride is in use. The coil/elastomer fork was pretty much useless for the test ride as it was mostly compressed while there was weight in the seat. Use of an air sprung fork would be recommended for more adjustability.<br /><br />- I would not feel comfortable using this child carrier off road or around traffic (as the instructions indicate should not be attempted). I didn't have a kid in it, just a weight, but if I had my kid in there she would be all squirmy and likely would be messing with my arms, kicking the handlebars, and leaning forward trying to reach the shifters/brakes/handlebars any way she could.  I also tried a trailer, which felt safer and more comfortable for me, but probably less fun for her.  So I ultimately just bought a toddler bike figuring she should learn to ride rather than being carried around (It's surprising how capable kids are, she's 3 yrs old and not doing too bad on her own bike).
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|You know Critics can't seem to ever get it right.  Movies of this type are for dreamers, syfy and others that want to just absorb the wonder of a story and not dissect it to death.<br /><br />This was a great movie about true human spirit with the belief that there is good out there for us all despite that bad that occurs.  The beauty of picking ourselves up and being about to start again.  It was about being human, it was awesome. I will be buying this one for my limited collection as I don't often buy movies.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|Disappointing and predictable, at the end I said, \\"that's it?\\" Boring in some parts, picks up in others but no page turn er.  Didn't keep me up late or make me late for work, guess that's a good thing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The plots just keep you betting for more. Ones think about the plots even when you are away. This is very entertaining.
B00499QUK2|5.0|I've been aware of this show for some time, but just recently decided to watch it. Well I have no idea why I've waited! This show is excellent from every aspect. The writing and acting are fantastic. I can't wait for season 3
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is a fun and addicting game. My six year old cousin loves it and always begs me to play it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I like the game but wish you could get more coins.<br />And more time for coin sides when they come up.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i love minions. this game is very fun and u should definitly purchase it. it is great for kids adults and eben tbe eldery.
111846446X|5.0|The book provides easy to understand examples and direction.  A good introduction and well written explanation into getting, configuring, using and programing your Raspberry Pi.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a very addicting and fun game. I enjoyed how there were many steps for each floor. The only problem was that it was over way to quick.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Really good game makes me think entertaining as well keeps me thinking and guessing really like it would tell others about it
B008476HBM|5.0|classic book, love it.<br /><br />Read it after watching the 1995 TV series.<br /><br />In comparison, the 1995 version is the most accurate of all the TV versions
B006FO3ERQ|1.0|This one was recommended to me based on reading history and other reviews said as soon as you got past the first part it was completely worth the read.  I disagree.  The first part is unbearable and followed by even more of the same.  Entire chapters lead no where, add nothing and wonder aimlessly in words.
1419707671|5.0|Great price, wonderful books, my granddaughter loves them. A gift to a 10 year old who thinks this series is the best. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. Thank you Amazon
B003F3FJQO|3.0|Just like The Maze Runner, the mystery behind WICKED and the trials kept me racing through this novel. I was hoping to get some more answers from this novel, but it appears that we are not going to get any answers until the very end of the series. It's very frustrating, but it keeps me coming back for more. One of the problems I had with The Maze Runner was how the secondary characters are almost completely ignored, and this happens even more so in The Scorch Trials. It amazes me that Thomas can spend weeks with a group of about 20 guys, and have not even the slightest connection with any of them, besides his couple of best friends. He doesn't even known their names or seem to even care when they die. You'd think after suffering through these trials together and spending weeks trapped with the same people, some connection would be established. In fact, while traveling through the desert, it's hard to remember there are a group of other guys besides Thomas, Newt, Minho, Aris, and Frypan. The others never utter a word, and are only acknowledged when they die, and even then, Thomas doesn't really seem to care, only to check that it's not one of his friends. I know there isn't enough time to get to know each character intimately, but I think Dashner could do a bit better by establishing a real connection amongst the entire group.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Came earlier than expected, basic blu-ray film. This is one of my favorite movies and glad to own it in blu-ray now! Film includes a theatrical version and extended version.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This one was on my recommended list for months before I finally read it, and it was awesome. The story is complex and surprising and really beautiful.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I would recommend this game to everyone who has played leps world or Mario bros. One of my favorite Android games. A must have if you played leps world.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I don't really know where to begin, but I definitely recommend this book to all people. Paper Towns will make you think about everything from the people you have misimagined to the feeling of leaving.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Any fan of The Beatles would love this blu-ray! Highly recommend this trip down memory lane (or should I say Penny Lane?)
B00BB8Q1RQ|5.0|i will just simply say that it's a good movie and you won't regret watching, it has lots of twists but it's mostly just the main's character life and what happens to him from the moment he is born.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I played it once and quit for the day at level 19. I tried to get back on today and it would not load. Im furious. I have to re do everything it took me 4 hours to get that far.! FIX THIS!
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Subway sufers is really good because you can use board in the air. The only bad thing is that most of the  stud cost lots of money
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you like sci-fi type movies with monsters, watch this! Mostly bad graphics are made up by a strong story.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|I enjoyed watching the &#34;Prestige&#34; - it was well cast, directed, and acted; and the movie gave a fun portrayal of the world of magic and magicians.  The biggest marks against the film were that neither protagonist was that likable (they were both obsessed), the mechanism behind the twist at the end relied on a supernatural element that didn't fit well with the rest of the story's world, and, finally, the ending was pretty dark.  I didn't walk away from the film feeling &#34;up&#34; - I prefer it if a movie makes me feel good; I'm not a real critic.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|This movie had a great story and amazing visuals. The human element is always a deal maker for me and I could watch it again and again.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Gratuitous blood and guts...as one would expect given the Director. However...<br /><br />Actors, Writers and Music made the movie; especially Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio.<br /><br />Loved the intro and all of the background music.<br /><br />Outstanding example of good &#34;Camp&#34; and entertaining acting...
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series. Gets better as the season develops, so stick with the first few episodes. Can't wait until they open up season 3 to Prime.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is the best TV show that has been on the air in the last 11 years (if ever).  Whomever made the decision to cancel it should never be allowed to work in the TV industry ever again.<br /><br />Every single aspect of this show was great, and getting better by the last episode.<br /><br />I don't think I will ever see anything that I enjoyed this much again.
0767919408|5.0|If you've read Bill Bryson, you know that between the juicy details and the wry humor he is the master of bringing time periods and historic figures to life. My dad was actually born in 1927, and even though these events took place 86 years ago, Bill's no-nonsense approach makes you realize that in terms of basic human nature, not a whole lot has changed. \\"They\\" could easily be \\"us.\\"<br /><br />Don't be put off by the hefty size. The book is broken into months, and the typesize and layout actually make for a quick read. My advance copy didn't contain the bibliography, but I would love to see high school teachers incorporate some of this work in their classrooms if only to show students that historical writing need not be dry and boring.<br /><br />I also love that Bill included an epilogue. You are going to get so wrapped up by these \\"stories\\" that you are going to wonder how these \\"characters\\" ended up. Bill takes care of that for you.<br /><br />Some of the key players: Charles Lindbergh, Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Henry Ford, Herbert Hoover, Jack Dempsey. Enjoy!
B00DH1G7DS|2.0|This game just doesn't look good or play as well as other versions I have played in the past. One other thing, the game description states the size as about 10MB, but on my device it took up 28MBs of space. That's not good. Some people may like this, try it while it's the faotd, however, be prepared for the larger download size.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like the pocket edition but I want the full version... cant ya'll put the app for free? then ill give 5 stars
B003NF0G12|5.0|Great flick.  We've enjoyed it immensely and will do for years to come! Can't beat a super cast with a good message.
0064471837|5.0|Amazing story with great plot. Shows the changes of a young woman fresh out of school into a powerful guardian of the gates of death.

Get Ready For One Mother Of A Road Trip!<br /><br />Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen are the perfect comedy duo, as they embark on one mother of a road trip! The plan for a quick stop at Mom's takes a sudden turn when an impulse compels Andy [Seth Rogen] to invite his mother, Joyce [Barbra Streisand], on an 8-day, 3,000 mile, and journey across the country.

Somehow, a mother-son road trip comedy seemed like the right move for both entertainers, separated by two generations and distant fan bases.<br /><br />Music legend Barbra Streisand began her film career forty-five years ago with a Best Actress OSCAR® win. A Golden Globe® Awards fixture who graduated to directing and producing, 71-year-old Streisand wields a staggered but respected filmography. Seth Rogen, who just turned 31, emerged as the comedic voice of his generation six summers ago when two of his raunchy R-rated comedies in Judd Apatow's ‘Knocked Up' [2007] and the Seth Rogen screenplay ‘Superbad' [2007] were among the year's most successful and acclaimed films at the time. Within two years, doubt began to form over his leading man status and since `The Green Hornet' [2011] showed him people weren't any crazier about him as fit, sarcastic superhero than as his signature chubby, sarcastic stoner, he and Hollywood have been rethinking his calling.<br /><br />Based on this trajectory, you might think Barbra Streisand was slumming in a desperate attempt to appeal to young people. In reality, though, her filmmaking legacy had been tarnished by her first two 21st century acting credits: playing Ben Stiller's mother in the sequels ‘Meet the Fockers' and ‘Little Fockers.' The first of those was outrageously successful, though only moderately popular. The second was neither. Thus, a Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen pairing held rebound potential for both of its stars.<br /><br />With a script by rising Dan Fogelman which includes ‘Crazy,' ‘Stupid, Love' and `Tangled,' the film seemed destined to do solid holiday season business and vie for some Golden Globe® Awards in the Comedy or Musical categories. Alas, `The Guilt' Trip' would do neither of those things, grossing a weak $37.1 million on a $40 million budget and picking up just a single award nomination of the undesirable variety, especially Barbra Streisand getting a “Razzie” for the Worst Actress. Embarrassingly, the night before the Golden Globe® Awards nominations were announced, an overconfident Paramount Pictures uploaded a promo celebrating the Best Actress nod to Barbra Streisand actually wouldn't get.<br /><br />Dan Fogelman doesn't offer much in the way of originality or complexity here. Andy Brewster [Seth Rogen] lives in California. His long-widowed mother Joyce Brewster [Barbra Streisand] lives in New Jersey. She fills his voicemail with conversational messages in expectation of a rare visit. Joyce likes to question her son Andy about his love life, to his discomfort. Meanwhile, Joyce shoots down his reciprocal question by saying she values being single for the ability to enjoy fun size bags of M&M Peanut’s, immediately before and after bed. When Joyce reveals to Andy that he was named after her first boyfriend, a Florida advertiser who let her get away, Andy Brewster does some online sleuthing and tracks this former love to San Francisco. A bachelor with a Master's in chemistry, Andy is planning to take an eight-day road trip to pitch his creation, a new organic cleaning spray, to major retailers around the country. He decides to make San Francisco the final stop and invites Joyce to join him on the Road trip!<br /><br />That sitcom premise takes nagging, cost-conscious mother and embarrassed son to sitcom stops for motel and diner sketches. In snowy Tennessee, Andy's high school sweetheart, now married and pregnant, recalls his rejected teenaged proposal to her. In Lubbock, Texas, Joyce gets an hour on the clock to eat a four-pound steak dinner in its entirety for free or fail and pay $100. In Las Vegas, Joyce gets the thrill of playing actual slot machines and not just the cell phone equivalents.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Andy's pitches to the likes of Kmart and Costco are a disaster, with executives not responding to his scientific claims or prop usage while struggling with the product's tough to pronounce name &#34;Scieoclean.&#34; Once Joyce suggests some ways to spice up his presentations, you can probably declare with ease where the film is heading and I don't just mean San Francisco and by the end of the film you want it to carry on.<br /><br />Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen, whose age difference is perfectly feasible thus highly unusual for Hollywood comedies, have decent chemistry together and better than you'd expect given the different circles they run in. Seth Rogen's foul-mouthed, drug-based shtick is softened quite a bit, but not enough to defang his comedic chops. He and Barbra Streisand are believable representatives of their different generations and they are able to bounce off each other, at times with apparent improvisation.<br /><br />The material has never been any better than a random episode of a mediocre twenty-year-old sitcom, but its comfort food comedy and the deliveries are good enough to unearth a bit of zest. Many of the beats are defiantly unoriginal: a man insisting on buying Joyce a drink at a cowboy bar, an uncomfortable book on tape, a mini-bar binge blow-up. But enough genuine details, e.g. Joyce's purse hook and insistence on hydration, emerge to distinguish the outing and prevent it from feeling like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu embodying one of comedy cinema's most exploited conventions.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – `The Guilt Trip' 1080p encoded transfer isn't the most stunning thing ever released in Blu-ray high definition, but Paramount Pictures stable, enjoyable presentation gets the job done. There are some gorgeous roadway and city shots; overhead highway images or dense downtown locations both reveal fantastic textures, crisp lines, and precise details even at a distance. General facial and clothing details are fine, though not really as crisp as those seen in the best Blu-ray releases. There is a light softness to parts of the image, and sometimes definition can be a little muddled, particularly in warmer locations such as a Texas steakhouse and a Vegas casino. Still, basic definition is just fine, particularly under good lighting. Colours are well balanced, favouring warmth in those more harshly lit environments and a more natural presence in those more naturally lit places. Black levels are not problematic, though flesh tones do look a bit rosy at times. The image suffers from no obvious bouts of digital tinkering, print wear, or compression issues. This isn't a breath-taking transfer, but it's a good, stable, clean high definition release that suits the movie well.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – `The Guilt Trip' features the old &#34;technically proficient, but sonically dull&#34; 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack, which would of been better served if it had just been a 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo soundtrack. No surprise, this is a dialogue-heavy film with little else to offer. Fortunately, the spoken word comes through as well as it can, playing with a natural, front-focused clarity. The track otherwise features some scattered ambient sound effects that help set the stage for various scenes and that enjoy natural, pinpoint positioning around the stage. Whether the light rattle inside the rental car and the minor whooshing sounds of passing traffic as heard when it's cruising down the interstate, booms of thunder and gusts of wind as heard in chapter six, or little Country music and general restaurant clatter as heard in chapter nine, the track presents the little supportive pieces quite effortlessly. This is certainly no massively immersive sort of presentation, but the basic quality is evident with every syllable and sound effect.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Special Feature: Barbra & Seth [2012] [1080p] [7:32] Cast and crew take a look at the chemistry between the stars and the acting chops of Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand.

Paramount Pictures has subscribed to the trend of devaluing the DVD even more than any other studio, seemingly altogether doing away with bonus features on the still most popular format. Adding insult to injury here, the DVD only uses 5.28 GB of a dual-layered disc's 8 GB capacity, meaning there is ample room for some of the dropped extras.<br /><br />Finally, 'The Guilt Trip' is a really pleasant surprise. It begins slowly but ends strongly, efficiently building up, breaking down, and again, but differently, building up its characters to a predictable but heart-warming and wholly satisfying resolution. The film works as well as it does because of the greatness of its leads; Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen are simply wonderful together. They understand the story, the characters, and one another so well that the relationship and the entire dynamic, not just bits and pieces feel as authentic as most any other memorable cinema family. Don't let a slow start ruin the film; it only gets better with every minute. Paramount Pictures Blu-ray release of `The Guilt Trip' offers a very solid video, fine audio and a few nice supplements to keep you amused. Highly Recommended!<br /><br />Andrew C.

B00CF34B2I|3.0|I think this app with its content is pretty awesome, and for being free. Though I do wish it would allow more content for free before asking you to purchase the full game.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This movie would had be ok except for the beginning.  Why you have to total nudity of the woman is beyond me.  The movie has good qualities, but for the fact of the start of the movie is pornographic, i wouldn't recommend it.
B001K3KK0Q|3.0|All of the actors in this movie are beautiful. The story is stiff; but then, I didn't like the story the way Fitzgerald wrote it. The movie closely follows the book.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|This is really just the key to take full ability of the app.  It would be better if you could just buy the full version without having to load a second app also.
141690977X|3.0|I got this book quite awhile ago and never reviewed it.. It was a big bestseller at the time .. It was alrigth I guess. I didnt follow most of the advice (of course) but I doubt the outcome would have been any different

B008K6HN8I|4.0|Great file manager.  Had to load this manger to take advantage of other apps that silk want allow you to load.  There really shouldn't be a restriction on what you are trying to load on your own device.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|Great acting.  fascinating story.  One great thing is how Malcolm X thinking changed over the years.<br />Denzel does a great job acting as usual.  Historically very accurate as far as I could tell.

B003U6BE8I|4.0|we were seeing it so we could see the new one. so we would not be confused. LOL. thank you
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am now addicted to this wonderful series.  I have an emotional tie to each of the characters. The writing is outstanding and the actors are top notch.  I have never enjoyed a series more than Downton Abbey. Congrats to all who were involved in putting this wonderful series together. It is EXCELLENT.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I love this series.  I've watched all Season 1, and I'm working on Season 2.  Dread it coming to an end.  Hope that Season 3 will be available on Prime before too long as I don't want to start watching on TV after the new season has already started.  I want to watch them all in order!
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|I liked the movie but it wasn't as exactly as I had expected. Very good acting by Denzel Washington!! If there is nothing else to watch you might enjoy!
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Great music; I'd like to tell Bruno the explicit sexual language doesn't enhance his ability as an artist. Gorilla just sort of turned me off rather than on...
B000KJT8IG|5.0|Still love to watch Chevy Chase and all the vacation movies. We watch this one every year so we decided to get the blu-ray. The kids love it.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Great transition from the prior season ending.  Looking forward to seeing the remainder of Season 5, ordered the entire season waiting for delivery.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I come to love (and hate) the residents of Downton Abbey. I'm very involved in their lives and can't wait until I see the next one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love all of them... but I love the last one the most. It is amazzzzzzzzing. And my favorit cost is the baby.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just recently started watching Downton Abbey and found Amazon an easy way to catch up on all the episodes I had not seen. Just love the show and all the characters. Season 3 is great although I am saddened by some of the plot twists. Looking forward to next season!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Really enjoyed this game. Quite frustrating when you miss obvious clues but satisfying when you click. Would have liked there to be less speech from the magicians, just wanted to get on with the game. Great fun though.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|The rod used for serrated edges is what should make this a winner of a product, however it actually becomes the weak link.  You will note the pictures of the product, and how it comes in packaging shows the rod extended out and not in the stored position - for a good reason - it is a tight fit to place it either in the fully extended or fully closed position.  I understand you do not want this flopping around when in use or folded away for storage but first and foremost you are in constant danger of snapping the rod in two trying to extend and lock into position, or fold and lock into stored position, and once in the stored position extreme care is needed to keep from breaking the rod trying to get it open again.  The rod is either glued or screwed on the plastic hinge, if it comes off, good luck reattaching.<br /><br />The overall size is nice, great for keeping with you out in the field.  The ability to attach to a lanyard is a plus as are the flat sides on which to rest it when using the blade sharpening slots.<br /><br />The carbide sharpening blades can be rotated when one side becomes worn, the ceramic ones however can not be.  Luck of the draw on if the sharpening blades (stone) is set correctly to provide the correct angle for the knife blade edge, seems a few out there are useless and dull rather than sharpen, the majority however work as advertised.<br /><br />Price and functionality, size, and multi-use make this a nice choice for putting a good edge back on a knife, not a keen edge but a nice and workable one...better than nothing.  The round rod for serrated edges...hmmmm...not so good, if used with caution it \\"works\\".  A solid three star product.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Never get tired of watching this movie.  Brings back good memories from when I was a kid in the 70's.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|This is probably the 10th time I have watched this movie since it's release. Yes, the movie has some crazy theories. But over all what makes JFK a masterpiece is that it is an entertaining thriller movie from beginning to end.
B004XBOBUC|5.0|I love this movie.  It is upbeat and positive.  Unfortunately  I could not play it on my machine.  In future could you please make it clear what machine you need to play it.  I am glad I had seen it before I tried to purchase it.  But please everybody do not hesitate to watch it
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|Good luck trying to keep up with this movie.  It just around, story to story, century to century. Dont rent
B009R8DJ72|5.0|The best book yet!!!!! I read it in one day<br />Totaly  worth it!<br /><br />I have read all the series!<br /><br />I recommend it!!!
B009GEAPYW|5.0|This is the best Batman movie ever! I was entertained from beginning to end! I couldn't wait to watch Part II afterward!
B00BGIC3T6|3.0|There were some pretty clever scenes but virtually no plot.  We had some laughs but just as many times we thought the jokes went on for a few seconds too long and got pretty unrealistic.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really like this game. It's so fun and addictng. if you like hidden images games, this game is for you.
B0058YZDQY|5.0|My workout routine consists of running about 25 miles a week, and squats in the gym. These shoes work great, are made of durable material, and don't hurt my feet if I run on gravel or uneven ground. I wear size 10.5, but I ordered 11's because Merrell seems to run about a half size small. Fit perfect, snug in the heel and open in the toes, no rub spots or pressure points.
B00B7FXYJG|5.0|Best Batman movie ever! I don't want to give anything away. You will have to watch it yourself. Check it out!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|If you enjoy science fiction movies then you'll probably enjoy this one too. Not a mega hit but just an enjoyable popcorn consumer. I'll probably watch it again one of these days...
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Fantastic...a holy grail for sci-fi lovers! The references were fantastic (their own little easter eggs), the storyline was brilliant, the pace was quick but not too quick, and the writing style easy to acclimate too. Seriously, a great read. Took my mind off ALL my troubles, and I've got QUITE A FEW troubles :)
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|I loved all the actors, but I reviewed it with others, who felt it was a depressing film.  Most of us reviewing this picture were old, so it hit home.  jhirsch

B005K0HDGE|5.0|We moved to Florida from Ohio after Kennedy was killed.  I watched the tragedy on some big combination Phillips stereo/TV/radio unit that did NOT make the trip.  We almost went off a cliff on the way, with one wheel of the rented uhaul hanging over the side of a mountain in Jericho TN, no interstates then. I am now writing my first book and of courses it involves time travel.  I praised SK for his detail and historical accuracy but the &#34; single bullet&#34; theory makes me choke on the idea that Oswald was the sole assassin.  My only question is, what if Oswald was the key to the historical changes and NOT Kennedy? Another, the absence of Ruby?  Maybe that was the key!  Great read, lots to ponder!
B00C2IJJF0|5.0|Screw the movie. It's not great at all. I mean, it serves a purpose. It reboots the franchise, and doesn't suck as bad as the original with the squawking golden mechanical owl through the entire thing, and it also lead the way for Wrath of the Titans, which doesn't have to follow the guidelines of any original and allowed the writers to do their thing and make an awesome film. That run-on sentence aside, I gave this 5 stars simply because of the Steelbook covering. My daughter never knows what to do with a Steelbook case. It's hilarious. She can chew all she wants, and she'll never make a dent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The movie was great to the gameplay is easy and fun thank you for the great game and movie if there is EVER a despicable 3 movie it will be the greatest movie of its century
B0020MKTOS|5.0|The movie with Clint Eastwood in it was really quite good I'm a fan of his shows any way seen almost every picture he was ever in . Good job. Loved it.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|Not bad but does not stand out in the crowd that this is the ultimate bubble game challenge....just quit playing because there wasn't much of interest.
B000I55YV2|5.0|Great story line!!!Can watch it over and over!!!! This is where I fell in love with the mini cooper!!  Great choice of actors!!
B005OT2YVA|5.0|I would suggest this to anyone who has children. Michael Bay did an excellent job on the movie and I hope his new one that comes out next year is as good as the three before it.
B005723JSQ|3.0|I found that Sophie Kinsella repeated the same/ similar pattern in her novels. Girls used silly excuses to cover their lies. A calm, intelligent guy would appear to reveal the truth, and of course they fell in love...<br /><br />I don't like this idea that Poppy picked up a phone from the bin and took it as her own property, and manipulated someone's emails/ messages. I hate it when she replied the messages for Sam without his approval. It is just evil!<br /><br />It could be a not too bad read for the beach. But I definitely would not recommend this book to my gfs.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Big fan great quality. Christoph Waltz steals the show. I've seen this movie probably 10 times and it never gets old.
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|Not sure where to start...first I need to address that I'm not a big golf fan. I understand the solitaire concept but not sure where it goes from there. The graphics are good but other than that I was very confused on how to play it.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This book is really good and it helps and fans or directioners ;D discover who One Direction really is... ENJOY !
B00COGY2P2|1.0|Slow moving, bad acting, boring dialogue. Tom Cruise is not feasible as Jack Reacher. He should stop the roles which require brut force and leave it to Mark Wahlberg, Rock, or Channing Tatum.
B00DH1G7DS|3.0|This is a nice casual sudoku game. The summer theme adds a little fun to the game. The sound effects are simple and not overbearing. The &quot;pencil&quot; answer is a nice added touch. The difficulty levels seem appropriately developed.<br /><br />In the realm of sudoku apps though, competition is fierce. This is my third sudoku app as a FAOTD alone. Here are a couple faults for this app:<br /><br />It automatically and immediately tells you if the number you chose was wrong. This makes even the most difficult level passable just by randomly clicking. It needs an option to leave all numbers to the end.<br /><br />You can only choose a difficulty, not a specific puzzle. Numbered puzzles would help.<br /><br />All in all, not bad for 99 cents.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just love this game super fun totally more fun than other games totes love it cool I love this game
B00594XOZU|5.0|I really like Kik! You can communicate with your friends and have fun texting! I really recommend this texting app!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I like the fact that there is plenty of chord length and it works good with the wall plug.  Makes its way to reach and use the kindle while it's charging.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was really looking forward to this novel and was very disappointed with what I read. I will read the next book, only because I want some kind of ending, not a to be continued.
B000FC2KL0|5.0|A great book if you're a big peppers fan and interested in learning about Anthony's early life, the band's origin, and where there music came from. All in all, very interesting.
034580709X|1.0|God only knows, so I gave it one star.<br /><br />As for a recommendation, I'd say, If you enjoy mysteries featuring morose, somewhat maudlin, self destructive alcoholic  detectives who are blessed with sudden, inexplicable bursts of insight, this book's for you!<br /><br />Oh, and vomiting and dirty clothes.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Once again the mix of science and action is ratcheted up.  I read this book in one day.  Love the Sigma Series and have turned several people on to it.  Keep them coming.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|What can you say about the Rolling Stones.......50 years of the greatest band in the history of Rock and Roll!  I loved it!!!!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app. I love how you can mix any sounds you want to create just what you like.
0375869026|5.0|I personally liked this book because of a couple reasons, first I liked it because the author made me feel like I was really there, I could feel Auggie's emotions, I could feel when he was sad, mad, and happy. Second I liked it because you got to read in the other characters point of view, like you would read in Auggie's perspective and then it would change to via's perspective.<br />This book kept me suspenseful and entertained.<br /><br />This book stands out because it really makes you understand what some people with deformed features  (in this case Auggie's face) have to go through.<br /><br /> I think that anybody who knows somebody like auggie or likes a good book would like this book because then they could maybe get a good idea about what people with deformed features have to live through.<br /><br />- Joe Baur
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one is riveting, but you need to read book one to understand the characters before reading book two. Enjoy.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!! I think anyone who liked the Percy Jackson books should read this book. It has twists and turns that have you wondering what will happen next.!:-)
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This book was good. I think the main character is getting a little shallow. I was mad in many parts of the book. I supported her when she stood up for herself and her best friend, but sad when she was sorry after words. One thing, I do not like maxen. He annoys me so much. The book was good for the most part.
0399159347|5.0|Just finished this book and loved it. It definitely got me thinking, and I felt like I was speed reading even though I didn't want it to end. Going to read more by this author!
B000PEX1IE|5.0|Love Bill Murray man, &#34;hey egon here's your mucus!&#34; Lolol classic when Egon said not to cross the streams!!!!! Yeah!
160459201X|5.0|In depth revelations are left to be discovered within this wonderful book. Providing an unparalleled view of the world around us, the power of the subconscious mind really proves to be a wonderful asset to creating and living a happy a fulfilled life.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|What if this was true?  It was a lovely tale and I enjoyed it.  I am a romantic at heart and this movie touched the heart.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I didn't really appreciate The Crow until I saw it again as an adult. It is now part of my Blu-ray collection and ranks among my favorite graphic novel adaptations. Great acting by Brandon Lee (don't think it would have worked without him) and gothic visuals. Such a promising start to a career that was sadly cut short due to a freak accident during filming.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Truly one of the great films made in the 90's.  The (true) story by itself is hugely compelling, but it is executed amazingly well.  The zero-g scenes shot on the &#34;vomit comet&#34; airplane add incredible realism too!
0689842449|4.0|The book was small but good illustrations and a great story about nature. I enjoyed the depiction of the whole process of germination.  Great for kids.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I'm a huge Rush fan. This album is great. It takes a little effort getting into it, since they whole albums tells a story from beginning to end. I recommend listening to this with the lyrics in front of you to better enhance the experience.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|What a wonderfully written mystery.  This writer is extraordinary.  I so enjoyed the mother daughter interaction, and I could very much identify since I have an adult offspring of my own.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|I didn't want to like this film, but ended up really enjoying its quirky take on the standard romantic comedy construct (albeit with much more drama thrown in).  Bradley Cooper is the standout, but all the actors are in top form.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I'm a new Kindle reader.  I am attempting to read free books.  I really enjoyed this one and will look for more books by this author.
B000O9XA72|5.0|Great album. Vinyl version sounds incredible. The fidelity on vinyl is much better than cd and a million times better than mp3. If you've enjoyed this digitally and you're an audiophile, vinyl is the way to go.
0553573403|5.0|...fulfilled! Can't wait to read the others in the series!<br /><br />Engaging, intereting characters, and a fast read for such a weighty book.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like the fact that on my Android phone I can sync up with my account and buy books. My phone is a bit small (Samsung Stellar), though so I look forward to more Kindle usage once I upgrade to a bigger screen. I also like having some free books to download.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a really long dictionary but it has useful information it s so awesome I found so many words I needed to find
B000OA0MS6|5.0|Great album. Vinyl version sounds incredible. The fidelity on vinyl is much better than cd and a million times better than mp3. If you've enjoyed this digitally and you're an audiophile, vinyl is the way to go.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This movie will get your adrenaline pumping. Included just about any action movie star you could think of...except Clint Eastwood.
B005544V6A|5.0|At first my wife was not to excited however I told her to watch one episode and now we both watch it. Love the show Harvey is one of those cold but cool guys like house.
3899554698|5.0|The book was perfect, i absolutely love illustration books. I spent several hours looking into every detail of those maps, it was very entertaining.
B00136NUG6|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend. She loved it. For any Earth Wind and Fire fan who doesn't already own these songs it would be worthwhile. For any RnB fan this is a must have.
B003O86MY8|5.0|Not so well know in NZ huge in Europe. Makes the violin sing, love the crossover into rock. Best track November Rain whole different dimension.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this one!  My grandsons are wizards at it! Play it frequently!  Addictive and fun way to pass idle time.
B006PKV2QU|5.0|We read this book before nap time and our daughter loved it. The illustrations are terrific!The overall content and way the author uses the English vernacular so creatively in the book eclipses any shortcomings on formatting.  The choice of words in the rhymes are thoughtful, creative and I too agree that overall there is an element that places it above the Dr. Seuss style. This is not suggesting that I don't love Dr. Seuss, because I most certainly do. After reading a handful of this authors books, I really believe that he has a special niche, a style and talent so unique and all his own. We're going to read this story again at bedtime. Keep up the literary fun! From 4 years old to adult age, we are all laughing and most fond of the stories.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think you should get this because it's pretty much all I PLAY !!!!! I WOULD DO ANY THING TO PLAY THIS ALL DAY EVERY DAY!!
B004W2V254|4.0|Even if you know the outcome of this story the movie is so well done that you find yourself on the edge of your seat anyway.  In the end the story is less about the climb itself than the disturbing phenomenon of mountaineering as a spectator sport.  I really enjoyed the film and its emotional impact is very well delivered.
B00DHSK3RM|4.0|Ok but difficult to perform the same moves.  helpful in that it shows it IS possible to get thru the level!
B00CAUK7IS|5.0|Great Hallowe'en flick!  Noisy enough that my cat disappeared but that's okay - I enjoyed it without her company.<br />Good job!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is so great I fell in love with it right away I couldn't stop reading and I love how different characters told there point of view
0062255657|5.0|I bought this book after hearing about it on Facebook. I am very glad I did. I read the whole book in about 2 1/2 hours. I couldn't put it down! The characters are believable, the action compelling and the fantasy wasn't too outrageous. Thank you Mr. Gaiman for a wonderful story that left me feeling intrigued and wanting more.
B0000669JL|5.0|great, it came on time. i recommend everyone to get it. it wasn't for me that i bought it it was for a friend.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is not as addictive as other apps and it's much more fun! I totally recommend  this for horse lovers!
1576754227|5.0|I've purchased this book 3 times now.  The first two were 'loaned' to personal friends and somehow managed to find a home in their libraries.  Highly recommend this book, time management and lots of business classes condensed down into an entertaining tutorial.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Have just started to play this game and beginners level is easy.......so far. Hope to eventually  move to next level
B005544V6A|3.0|The premise of the show is cool. I love law shows with quirky but this show tries too hard and the acting is hard to watch. I gave it 4 episodes and I was still disappointed.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love Sudoku games, and this one has several different versions which I've never played before.  You can also choose various difficulty settings. I'm having fun with it!
1452113432|5.0|I love it.  It reminds me so much of Paris and gave me so many ideas for cooking Parisian food.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love this game! Alright I am a 50 something year old & shouldn't be sooo excited about a silly video game...but it is soooo cute. I am a BIG Disney geek so, this is a given. It is just so exciting to do certain things  Nemo ask you to do and you get rewarded, sometimes with coins or maybe a fish. You do have to prevent yourself from using real  money though, so watch little ones with this app ...It has parental controls, so you can block lil ones making big purchases. Anyway...I got it as the FAOTD, but it is worth a modest price. Get it today!
B00DUL3VFM|4.0|This movie is great.  It's got a classic performance by Kurt Russell, but he doesn't take over the movie.  Love it.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|This game is simple, but not all that simple to play!  You are given a decorated ball, and you have to replicate it using tools and paint.  Some levels are pretty easy, but some take a bit more logic (and trial and error) to figure out.  Each level is pretty quick, so it's a nice little game to play here and there.
B00006RAKP|5.0|How does he do it? I can't think of a time that I have not heard an Elton John song on my way to (fill in the blank here, school, work, the market, a date... Think of something). Most of these songs are top ten hits! This album is a great buy if you own no other Elton John titles, or are just looking to fill in the blanks in your collection. Either way 34 songs is an impressive catalog.<br /><br />P.S. Amazon Cloud Player makes buying either MP3 albums or CDs with Autorip so worth it! No need to store music on your device AND you can access it from just about anywhere?! (Also, if you go Autorip, they essentially send you a &#34;back-up&#34; CD just in case of an incident...) Sign me up!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Was great to see a fun action packed movie that didn't take itself too seriously. Good star power and I look forward to RED 2
B009WUBERW|3.0|This movie is what it is and nothing more. If you are in the mood for this type of movie you will enjoy it. If ou are in the mood for something deep, you should probably pass.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|This was a great movie.<br />The book was well written and goes more into the history of the mission and the causes of the failure.<br />But both are very nicely done!
B00C33M2EE|5.0|The Piano Guys amaze once again! Beautiful music that takes you on an emotional journey you will want to return to again and again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The story and characters are all quite gripping. I could not put it down. Everyone needs to read this before it gets jilted in theaters.
B0096HI226|2.0|This movie had so much hype yet it was a total letdown. The \\"storyline\\" if that's what you could call it, lacked substance even.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I liked the Orphan Train because it was a good book about a sad story.  It was basically about two lives that come together at different stages of life but had a similar youth story.  I find it fascinating how people can survive such hardships and still find some normalcy in their lives.
B00DUGCLY4|2.0|Very enjoyable app. Makes u think. One of the apps that I have most enjoyed in a very long time. Would recommend to others.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I am really enjoying this book it explains a lot about how I grew up and who I am now
B00B7Y0206|5.0|This app is perfect for people who spend a lot of time on YouTube . This app is a fix for videos you can't watch on a mobile device.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This is a mahjong game you want to play, if you like these kinds of games, you will enjoy this one for sure.  Works great on my kindle fire hd, no problems running and lots of designs to chose from to play.  Never heard of the maker (Pozirk), but will watch for more from this company again!!
B009WUBERW|3.0|It has action (guns, fights, explosions) and a mediocre at best plot.  It is an encyclopedia of has-been's one liners.  It is mildly entertaining, so viewing on Amazon Prime (free) makes me feel like I got what I paid for.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The book could not hold my interest...Does not compare to his other two books, which I could not put down. I did  not finish the book.
B00821OX98|5.0|I loved the show, I'm into sci-fi and this is so much fun. Great cast and special effects in the show.
B00A757EFW|5.0|App works well on my Samsung Galaxy S III. I love to play when I get the chance to open it up.
0062238868|5.0|Great book of one of the countries hero warriors.  Too bad he was cut down in his prime trying to help a fellow warrior.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I got a bit tired of the Big Fish games,  they all seemed too much alike,  just diff stories. This was a pleasant storyline,  graphics a 4 out of 5 and the games were fun,  not all that running back and forth either!
1878424319|5.0|This is an awesome book, I given several copies to people, and personally read it several times.  It was a life changing book. I actually had my children read it as well.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|The squishy bits keep it from a 5th star. Always disappointing when a good rude comedy goes soft. Two more words.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|If you're looking for a fun movie to take the kids to, this is a good choice. Cute, heartwarming story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Few modern YA writers can weave prose like John Green. His style is effortless, his characters immensely relatable, and the questions he raises incredibly thoughtful. Prepare to have your heart torn out and put back together again.
0525478817|4.0|I really like the book. I saw it at target for 19.99. So i saved some money! It came in about 3-4 days, which is great! I can't wait to read more of john green's books!&#60;3
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series...I couldn't have enough. I hope they have the next seasons available soon. I truly loved It
0064471837|5.0|An amazing story covering the life a girl, who unbeknown to her will start on one of the most gripping adventures of her life, as a abhorsen, to save her father. She will travel back to world she forgot to save it from the greatest evil it has ever known, meeting friends old and new whilst using knowledge she has gained growing up at school and that she was taught by her father. There are alot of ups and downs along the way, but what will happen when her 2 worlds colide? Will she be able to put down the great evil? Will she be able to turn her back on the world she knew to enter one unseen by her as a adult? Only time will tell.<br /><br />This is one book i recomend, it has so much rereadability and everytime you do there is something so subtle there that didnt reveal itself. This book is an amazing read that will keep you griped from the first page and even if you read it 10 times you still feel your heart pound as if you are by her side, libing through what she lives through, seeing what she see's and feeling everything she feels. It will last the test of time and can be enjoyed by all ages and cultures.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I started reading this as a sample offered off the kindle from a few suggestions, I thought it would be nothing special. Another ordinary book, I was pretty wrong. The book was really good, much better then I had expected and I could see why it had so many people trying to suggest it to me. If you're someone who's into fantasy books, I would definitely recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a really fun addictive game challenges and exercises your brain. Never gets old and each level is unique.
0064471837|5.0|The first time I read this book I remember staying up all night just to get to the final page, it was that amazing. The book captivated me from beginning to end, spellbound and on the edge of my chair. Since then I have been attached to Garth Nix's hip anxiously awaiting whatever adventure might come next. You won't regret picking this up, I've reread it a countless number of times and there is always something exciting and new each time. Money well spent!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This has been an enjoyable show. It was too dramatic for my teens, fourteen and fifteen, but my husband and I enjoyed it.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great book for all leaders - women and men!  Insightful information on communication styles and mindset for women.  This information could also be applied to relationships outside the workplace.
B008X9Z37A|4.0|how ever I thought is was a case that had the ability to stand up my kindle and it does not
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|A must read for everyone but per-teens & teenagers especially. Really helps you put our real priorities into perspective.  I downloaded it by accident but was happy I did. Great book.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Needs to checked to see what is wrong, no other game to compare it to. What else is there to say.
B003UYUP58|5.0|An excellent easy to read but long history of the losing battle against cancer.  The book makes a great case for the futility of finding a &#34;solution&#34;.  Even more compelling is the history of the cures and tests that have been perpetrated on the naive public over the last 100 or so years. The callous use of patients for tests and literally using humans as lab rats is eye opening. I have a fatal cancer and find no encouragement from the medical professionals, the pharmceutical companies, or the truely corrrupt &#34;War on Cancer&#34;.  Only the undertakers win in this game.
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Third time i have read it and it is still good. I really love this book and going to read the next one
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The game was not fun. No instructions for you to learn. Game sucked the big one. Provide instructions next time
B0092S4WLY|1.0|Needs someone to play the game from dozengames.com so they can try to get from one level to another, not enjoyable to.have to keep starting the game over.
B002VECLVY|5.0|Brilliant depiction of one mans interpersonal struggles with the grief following the tragic death of his partner. --<br />Tom Fords interpretation of Christopher Isherwood's novel demonstrated that, even in his directorial debut, he has a clear understanding of how to bring his unique style to an incredibly memorable film.<br />As for the performance of both Colin Firth and Julianne Moore, I have but one work... BRAVO!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Call of the Wild is a heart breaking to heart wrenching to a heart warming story. The first 'person' view through Buck's eyes gives the reader a (very) possible look inside a dog's mind. Buck's personification in the story solidifies his place in the world through his struggles, his pecking order placement, his calculation and his triumphs. Though not an easy read-it took me a few pages to acclimate to the language-I highly recommend this book to challenge the mind.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Save the invest points.  It's easy to get stuck after a bit and unable to grow the city without them.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Great follow up to Ironman movies with him continuing with other super heroes in a quest to save the world in a great adventure movie.
B00DHNBPA6|1.0|this movie was unnecessarily graphic.  it wasn't scary at all, just plain bad taste in trying to grab the attention of the audience.  the only good thing about is was Jessica Lucas!
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|All the songs are great. I've listened to all of them several times and I'm still not bored with them.
1583334386|2.0|I could not stand this book. It insults the reader's intelligence, and attention span, with every needless subclause.<br /><br />Pros: the chapter summaries and action points are clear and sensible, advising the reader to set a willpower goal and working through weekly exercises towards this. If the book were condensed to the summaries, it would be considerably better.<br /><br />Cons: Everything else. I want a book that, as this claims, argues carefully from scientific evidence, and is clear about what is known and what isn't known. Most of the book besides the main points is filler, prattling on about things middle-class americans want with rather too much about eating brownies etc. This is repetitive and inane, I wanted to throw the book across the room until eventually deciding to return it.

B000UBMSB8|5.0|Wow! Three versions of the movie are included here along with a feature length documentary about the making of Blade Runner. Make no mistake, this is every fan's dream because it is loaded with extras. I have the 4-Disc Collector's Edition though many others have since been released on Blu-Ray and DVD. Harrison Ford was even included (but there was little mention of his dislike of Ridley Scott or the film though). It's one of the best behind-the-scenes documentaries I have ever watched (it reminded me of the excellent Never Sleep Again documentary on A Nightmare on Elm Street). Almost all of the main cast, crew and producers have returned to tell their stories. They talk about casting, shooting, editing, financing and everything else Blade Runner. If you were living in the dark ages with an old DVD or VHS copy of this you will love the deluxe treatment Blade Runner received with this upgrade.<br /><br />The movie itself is one of the greatest science fiction films of all-time. A police officer comes out of retirement to track down some illegal replicants (human cyborgs) who look like humans but are much stronger and at least as intelligent. Harrison Ford stars as Deckard who is trying to find his own humanity. It is stylistically similar to film noir (think 1940s) so that is not to everyone's taste (this is not Star Wars). I have shown this film to many people and few get it. Almost no one gets it the first time but this gets better with each repeat viewing. It also boasts an excellent original story from the legendary Hugo award winner, Philip K. Dick. Blade Runner was adapted from Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by PKD.<br /><br />Blade Runner has 3 cuts, great video and audio transfers and plenty of featurettes and supplemental material.

0307730700|5.0|Author Eric Blehm put together a beautiful account of Adam Brown's life. His research appears to be impeccable, including the testimony of family, friends, military commanders, and Brother Seal team members. I loved hearing a near first hand account of one man's fight for not only our freedom but for the freedom of strangers far removed because he believed in the cause! Adam's passion for love of God, country, family, and  humankind, was very moving. I recently handed out 22 copies of this book. I am starting to get back the comments of how great this story is. One gal read it in two days, she couldn't put it down! I highly recommend! Thank you Eric Blehm for your service of telling the world about Adam Brown.

B009LQKHIO|4.0|Finished this book in a day.  Perfect easy read for vacation.  Made me smile and wipe a few tears.  It' about the kind of love we all want to find!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I rated this a 5 star because it is an outstanding read!  It combines humor with a love story with sad events along the way!  The characters are excellently developed and portrayed and it will tug at your heart strings.  Well read young readers (the book targets this group) will like it and I am really a lot older and I loved the book!  This author, John Green, has a wonderful style.  I am glad he is young so he has a lot of time to write more wonderful books.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|While a little dark, the movie was wonderful!  Such a great story, and only slightly predictable.  The acting was spectacular!

B00DURILJ2|5.0|Finally! He's back. I almost gave up on him after all of the horrible romantic comedies.<br />This movie was a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />The young actors who played Ellis and Neck were phenomenal.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I very much enjoyed this Homeland Season 1. It is very well acted. Intense and dramatic.  My only complaint is that Sgt. Brody and Capt. Mike Faber would have looked more like Marines if they had had proper &#34;high and tight&#34; Marine haircuts. That would have made them appear more authentic.  I also had a problem with an enlisted (Sergeant) and an officer (Captain) being such buddies.  Did the Captain have a job?  Why was he so available to hang around Sgt. Brody.  And the Captain having an affair with the Sergeant's wife.  Other than those points Homeland is a great program.  I will be ordering season 2 as soon as it is available.
B00178JDCK|5.0|General disclaimer: Now, this is a Behringer, so all the usual jokes and caveats apply. As far as the major complaints go, I think there are 3. First- Behringer pedals are noisy. Now, I have this and 3 other Behringers in my chain, and a Digitech multifx that I am just using as a volume pedal, and there is not really much more noise being added than what is already coming into my amp from the mains power. Second, that it is flimsy plastic. Yeah, true, it's not solid adamantium like you get from your local boutique manufacturer, but so what? You're not going to destroy it by clicking the switch. And you didn't buy it to go on tour, so let's not pretend. Third- that Behringer pedals are pieces of crap that break instantly. Well, all three Behringer pedals I ordered recently have worked just fine, and the other Behringer products I've owned are all still in fine shape. I suppose what I'm trying to say is that while I'm no shill, as I certainly recognize the fact that these are budget pedals, I don't get why everyone seems to think Behringer is the music gear equivalent of a flaming bag of dog poo. For the hobbyist, it's perfect.<br /><br />Now for the Reverb Machine specifically, the features are pretty self explanatory. Soundwise it's great- very warm on the more traditional verb types, and the weird settings are certainly workable. I tested both spring settings against the actual spring reverb in my amp- and weirdly enough, if I didn't know better, I would have said that the pedal's springs were more \\"real.\\" Go figure. This isn't your one stop shop for shoegaze, but it's certainly a great start, and quite versatile.

159463176X|4.0|However, I agree with my sister's thoughts.  We felt that if we had never read &#34;Kite Runner&#34; or &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34; we would have not had such high expectations for this book.  It is certainly the least of the 3.

B009XIXVU6|1.0|Enjoyed Hosseini's first two books immensely but thoroughly disappointed with this one.  Feels like writing for a publisher with a deadline.  I quit about 1/2 way thru.
0064471837|5.0|I judged my book by its cover all those years ago, well, nine years ago to be exact so I was aged fifteen; I picked up this novel and was fascinated by the fiery, circular symbol on a vivid white cover and when I lifted the book to the light of what was back then in Lincoln, United Kingdom, the Ottakars book store, the smaller white symbols in all shapes and varieties caught the light and drew me in. I know you should not judge a book by it's cover and I am ashamed to say that I did, but the thing is, I am so pleased that I went against the rule because for me, it was the beginning of something truly wonderful.<br /><br />I have always liked my fantasy fiction, what with being a big fan of Tolkien's and Philip Pullman's work when I was a teenager but it was rare for me to pick up something by an author I hadn't heard of before, more so, of whom I did not know if I would even enjoy their writing style. Needless to say, Tolkien and Pullman took a back seat and have remained in a second place position ever since and no author has yet moved Nix from the top spot.<br /><br />I here you asking, \\"Why?\\" and for me, it is quite simple really.<br /><br />The descriptions.<br />The paragraphs of descriptive prose.<br />The ability to lure you into the world of The Old Kingdom with nothing but describing words uniquely placed together to create a world and atmosphere so vivid, so real, that you can feel the snow falling on your bare skin, smell the acrid stench of dead bodies rising where they fell.<br /><br />In some places, namely, with the describing of as above mentioned, the dead, you cannot help but feel your skin crawl, goose flesh flicker up your naked flesh and neither can you help but feel your stomach turning in anxious fear of these horrible creatures. I know many friends who have claimed to me they couldn't read any more of these magnificent books, purely because the dead creatures (or as they called them, zombies) scared them that much. Perhaps I am just weird, but don't you even find that beautiful? To become that involved with a writers words to feel, to imagine, to see the world and it's happenings is definitely a talent that only a special few authors in history have.<br /><br />This book, the first in a trilogy of The Old Kingdom, is aimed towards a young adult market and it is clear; whereas Philip Pullman pushes these boundaries, Nix brushes past them in an exciting and alluring way, which will keep older readers (such as myself with my twenty-four years of age) and then younger teenagers discovering the world and their bodies and feelings to the opposite sex, hooked and interested from start to end. You watch these young adults in Sabriel and Touchstone, grow and evolve in what seems to be a rather cut-throat world, so where as often, in these age implied books, characters can seem somewhat two-dimensional and plain, annoying and stereotypical, you instead get the wonderful leading lady of Sabriel becoming in my opinion, a role model for those teenage girls growing up, with her head screwed firmly on her shoulders and always with a plan to put into action when danger comes flying her way.<br /><br />As much as I think that this book could have been a stand-alone-one-of-it's-kind sort of novels, there is so much more to explore and that is left unanswered: what of Mogget and his strange ways?; what is beyond the first few gates of Death; what more is there to discover of the Charter and the idea of the acrid, bile raising scent of free magic?; will we find out more about the Clayr because I know I wanted too.<br /><br />A book full of emotion, revelations, sadness, love and peril, there is so much to dig you teeth into and it doesn't stop with Sabriel; as part of a trilogy, there is more to come and Sabriel is just an introduction to it all, plus with Clariel's imminent and long awaited release, there is so much to wait for and more.t don't you even find that beautiful?

B000002NAK|5.0|Great musical. Possibly my favorite. Madonna does an good job at singing these songs. You Must Love Me is an great original song written for the film version.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Let me start my review with how the ending made me feel when I finished this book a few hours ago. I felt overwhelmed, shocked, satisfied, afraid, and awed. If I was told to sum up this book in one sentence only, it would be this: hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. None, zero, zilch, nada, nothing.<br /><br />Gone Girl is a complex read, but nothing overly complicated. Don't expect to walk away from it unaffected, though. No matter what your gender or what relationship experiences you've had in life - good or bad - you're going to experience a myriad of emotions while reading this novel and relating to these characters in one way or another. It's impossible not to feel something for either or both of them. Depending on your own current or previous experience with a life partner, you're going to pick a side in this book. However hard I tried to understand both these characters and feel compassion for them, I just couldn't. I picked the one who in my opinion was the victim through all that happens in this story, and stuck with that character to the end. Although I have to admit, it wasn't always easy.<br /><br />And here's something else you should know: this book will mess with your mind. It starts out real slow telling you how Nick and Amy met, how they fell in love, and what their relationship was like those first few glorious years. It was such a slow beginning, in my head I had already given it a three-star rating, because I was a little bored with all the theatrics and the giddiness of a new couple who viewed the world and their new relationship through rose-tinted lenses. Around twenty percent into the book, when things pointed to Nick (the husband) as the culprit in his wife, Amy's disappearance, did I get interested enough to continue reading on. Almost halfway into the book, I was completely hooked. Was Amy murdered? Was she kidnapped? Did she run away? Where the heck is Amy, and why is Nick so evasive? I'm sure I had it all figured out.<br /><br />But THEN...<br /><br />Then the author goes, surprise! Whatever you thought you knew? With whomever you think your loyalties lie? Whichever direction you think this is going? You haven't seen anything yet. Folks, I was - as the author had intended - shocked to the core. I didn't see it coming. I never had a clue (even though I thought I did). All the mushy stuff at the start actually had a purpose...as I discovered during the rest of the story. To have created such psychologically intricate minds, such messed-up characters; such vindictive and manipulative personalities, is inarguably the work of a genius mind. A very insightful one at that. Honestly, sometimes it was so emotionally exhausting trying to stay a step ahead, I just had to put the book down and take a breather. But in the blink of an eye, I was reading again. Staying awake until the early hours of the morning, reading in the car, sneaking a peek while at the office, using every opportunity available to get tangled up in the war-zone of the Dunne's nuclear marriage.<br /><br />Gone Girl is not an easy book to read, but every minute spent reading it, makes it worthwhile at the end. The writing is superb, the plot absolutely exceptional and very cleverly done, and the characters flawed, self-righteous, terrifying - a watercolor of the darkest parts of the human mind. This book is a treasure trove of debatable topics perfect as a book club read. I recommend it to everyone over the age of eighteen, no matter what your genre of preference.THEN...<br /><br />Then the author goes, surprise! Whatever you thought you knew?

B00DDQTKHM|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moZ4YNGKIEIIQO]]Over the past four years, I've found myself referencing The New Rules of Marketing & PR more often than I ever imagined. It's one of the few print books I keep in my office and on the shelf. I also often recommend the book to executives looking to get a clear and compelling understanding of the digital universe and how they can put it to work for their organization. Marketing and PR professionals will find the book refreshingly insightful. The book's focus on strategies and tactics that work keep it hype-free and simple - which I like.<br /><br />The Fourth Edition has completely new and updated case studies, and a wonderfully compelling new section on Newsjacking (which I'm eager to embrace after reading the book.) There are interesting new insights into app development (including a chapter on Uber.) I particularly enjoyed David's Instagram section and the new (and compelling) ideas to leverage Google Plus and Google Hangouts for my business.<br /><br />In short, there aren't many books I recommend you own a paperback copy of (as opposed to an electronic edition) but this is one of them. You'll find yourself referencing it for the next two years (or at least until David Meerman Scott releases the 5th edition.)
0064471837|5.0|I love Sabriel and the following books in the series as well. The world Nix creates is rich without being so complex that I need to get out a map and compass. His main characters are fallible, three dimensional and one feature that I particularly enjoy, mostly strong females. I also like his original ideas about the realms of death. He approaches the subject without making it more gory than it has to be.
0761172726|3.0|My family has used the calendar for years. We love it. The vertical format makes so much sense when dealing with multiple schedules. My only complaint is that dads are just as important as moms.  Not only is the calendar called \\"Mom's Family Calendar,\\" but MOM is printed on top of the first vertical column. There are many, many homes where there is no mom. I am a mother and I know that moms are not the be all end all of the parenting world.<br /><br />In the complex family culture of 2013 this calendar should be renamed something like, \\"The Best Family Calendar Ever.\\"  Until the calendar is renamed, I will continue my yearly habit of taking a black sharpie and blotting out all the \\"Moms.\\" I do this to honor and remember all those uncles, grandfathers, fathers, cousins, aunts, sisters, brothers, neighbors, and friends who do the difficult job of being awesome parents without having the title of \\"mom\\".

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I enjoy Uno. This app is a great way to experience one of my favorite classic card games with other people, though I don't necessarily use the friends feature.<br /><br />Then the major thing that makes this app free becomes the major reason why this review gives two stars.<br /><br />Advertisements. Very often they crash my game instead of regularly straight off the bat ticking me off. It uses a horrible video advertisement system that freezes the game if I try to skip it with the back button. Also, after doing my daily scratch ticket for coins (2 per game, so limits), it gave me a JAPANESE commerical, or whatever language it was. I am playing from the east coast of America and that is unreasonable. Commericals in any app are going too far. If you're willing to pay to remove the apps, this is five stars for you. It's ridiculous, is Gameloft that desperate for money that they shove us so many ads?

B000DWMN2S|4.0|I thought this movie was really well done. It has some subtitles, so if you don't mind then you're good. I think it was well written. It's a quirky yet interesting film about a mans search for where he comes from. I loved it. It has a bit of bad language though, so definitely not kid friendly.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|This book was a great follow up to the precious books in the series. It was a great read and had a good combination of romance and mystery for the next novel in this series.
B000AM6OQ2|1.0|This is undoubtedly one of the stupidest, poorly acted, and lame movies I have ever seen and I am kicking myself out into the fog for buying it!!  I can't even waste the space on my shelf for this one, it's already in the trashcan!  Since four letter words are frowned upon here, there is no way I can describe this absurd waste of time.
B00BQBNK04|4.0|I am a fan of the Tenth Anniversary Concert (TAC) of Les Miserables. I thought their singing and acting was amazing. While on the surface, the singing is not as good as TAC, some allowances have to be made for this being a movie.<br /><br />I like each version (TAC and movie). Each have their pros and cons. While the singing for the isn't quite what TAC has, I believe that the way the actors and actresses sang for this movie was perfect for a movie. Movies seem to allow a less &#34;pretty&#34; version of songs, because that allows what we see and hear to feel more realistic. And for TAC, it was wonderful singing (and it's just as emotive!) but the singing is &#34;pretty&#34; as opposed to the movie--however, this works best for the stage.<br /><br />I am giving this 4 stars only because I think that watching the movie is better than listening to the soundtrack. You really need to see it as well as hear it to experience it properly.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Great family movie, with essence and a a great message. Funny, great casts, perfect songs, choreography. My 3 yr old daughter can't stop watching it over and over again. We are trying to learn all the songs!!!!<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL PUERTO RICO BEACHES!!!!

B0027MJU00|2.0|Dark Places by Gillian Flynn is a waste of time. Her changes in point of view continue to be unrealistic and poorly written with weird twists and turns that are totally off the wall.  It took me half a summer to finish Gone Girl although it caught my interest in the beginning.  This woman has a flair for writing, but she is not able to sustain anything of worth.  My fear is that she has some sort of background that should enable her to represent her characters honestly, but frankly, she is lazy about details and goes totally out of the realm of reality.  She most likely believes that people in stressful situations do not behave well---and that may be very true. But her failure to follow through with realistic details is a major flaw.  It is a waste of time to read Flynn---She needs to back up what she considers to be details. It seems that quite often she forgets what she has written and fails to back up what she has said. Her novels begin well, but she falls flat in her character development.  Poor, poor, poor.
B000OVLBF8|3.0|The special effects of the different spirits were good.  So was the evil one.  I would recommend this movie on them alone.
B00EE3KMOI|5.0|I bought the DVD for this the day it came out in May, because I did not want to wait 4 months to watch, but I can recommend this series without a doubt.<br />The most extraordinary story ever, written & produced by Chris Chipnall, one of the top British writers today. A Brilliant cast, featuring the cream of British actors. The best drama of the year, keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire film. The locations for this film are beautiful.<br /><br />The body of a 11year old boy is found on the beach in Dorset, England. The murder and following investigation create a chain reaction that will tear this small seaside town apart. A town wrapped in secrets, like most small towns anywhere in the world, and they become known as the investigation proceeds. The Murderer remains veiled until the final episode and a surprise and more importantly the reason.<br />The two investigators, DI Hardy a harden, efficient, and blunt outsider with the reputation for failure - played brilliantly by David Tennant - and DS Miller a sensitive and friendly local - played by the extraordinary Olivia Coleman. The interactions between these two is amazing - some of the best dialog and zingers - like when Miller tells Hardy \\"leave me alone or I will piss in a cup and throw it on you.\\" - Or when Hardy tells Miller \\"I pray nightly that you will leave me alone.\\" The remaining Cast is spectacular - you can actually feel the grief and suspicion coming from their characters. The film is well worth watching or better off buying the DVD if you like great drama and great acting.

0553386697|5.0|Being a neurotic, first time parent, this is one of many child rearing tip books I have read. This book is great, because the explanations offered in the book are helping my husband and I be better at handling our emotions as well as giving us tools to also help our son.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I really love all the different puzzles and challenges! It's addicting even when frustrating. You want to complete each level, but you don't want it to end.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Excellent coloration and saturation thereof, technically above adequate, and hearkens back to the television ur-sci-fi series: &#34;Captain Video&#34;! Kudos therefor.
193700788X|3.0|The last Sookie Stackhouse book.<br /><br />I've been attached to Sookie for a long, long time now - Anita Blake was the first paranormal series I fell in love with, the series that got me hooked on vampires, werewolves, and witches OH MY! And Sookie was the second.<br /><br />Kudos to Harris for choosing to end this series before it got stale and tired (unlike the Anita Blake series, which I keep on reading and complaining about).<br /><br />I finished this book a couple of weeks ago, but had to sit on the review because I honestly didn't know how I felt about the book. It was a quick read, like all the Sookie books, but I didn't want a quick read - I wanted to savor the last book. You knew the last book was going to be all about resolving Sookie's love life, which pretty much was exactly the point of the last book. Yup, there's other stuff going on, but those other story lines didn't really seem to be terribly well developed/thought out/well written, and just seemed like an afterthought - something to help keep the book going, something to help keep the book from being only 50 pages long.<br /><br />So what DID I think? Well... I was disappointed. The last Sookie book, ever? Well, you just expected a lot... you expected great things, amazing things... and, well, the series concluded exactly like you knew it would, with exactly no surprises. And that just seemed like Harris cheated us a little bit. It just seemed like Harris wanted to make the long time readers happy, let's finish up the series, and be done with it.<br /><br />So... that's the bad stuff. What was good about it?<br />* you find out who Sookie ends up with.<br />* it's the last book of the series<br />* Umm.<br /><br />And there you have it. I think the fact that I can only come up with one good thing about the book, helps me to realize I rate this 3 stars. Why 3 stars? Because honestly, I knew all along she was going to end up with who she ended up with, and Charlaine Harris delivered that, as horribly badly as she did so.<br /><br />There are a LOT of other reviews on this book, though annoyingly, most of the reviews start with \\"I didn't read this book, but I read other reviews, and I think\\" blah, blah. How do you review a book without actually reading the book?bly badly as she did so.<br /><br />There are a LOT of other reviews on this book, though annoyingly, most of the reviews start with \\"I didn't read this book, but I read other reviews, and I think\\" blah, blah.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Great cast, writing isn't bad and drop dead gorgeous people and skyscraper office views most people would never see.  I love the chemistry between Mike and Harvey but Louis is a scene stealer and I love how his character has evolved.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love Harry Potter and there is nothing better than having them all in the same place for me to watch whenever!
159463176X|4.0|If you enjoyed The Kite Runner, you will like this book too.  It holds your interest very well. Read it and enjoy
B00C7LB20C|4.0|Nice to watch a move in at home that is still in theaters for such a great price.  Who doesn't love Aaron Eckhart.  Good drama and action.  The relationship between father and daughter was interesting to watch.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|I like the Original version better, but I have to admit the extended story line is catchy and the expanded characters are engaging. I think Tim Burton does a pretty good job.
B007HO392S|5.0|Purchased this for a gift and decided to keep it myself...great selection of songs... great addition to my music collection!
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Finished &#34;the orphan masters son&#34; which catapulted me into the North Korean realm of shock and appreciation. This real life account will make you grateful and proud of the life you are able to lead in a free country.

B00E8B1P9M|2.0|Wow.  Hard to even begin.  The story was jumpy and barely had a plot.  Very disappointing.  SOOOOO glad I didn't pay theater money for this one.

B000089RVX|5.0|As a fan of rock and metal, I loved hearing Evanescence on the radio. After some time, the stations around hear stopped playing anything new by them. I only knew a handful of songs from them anyway. So, one day I thought I'd find out what Evanescence had released. I listened through all three of their studio albums (not any of the live or demos) Fallen, The Open Door, and Evanescence (obviously self-titled).<br /><br />Fallen is by far the best Evanescence album. Every song is amazing. The popular ones (I heard on radio) are &#34;Going Under&#34; and &#34;Bring Me To Life.&#34; I can't believe &#34;Everybody's Fool&#34; was never played (or at least I never heard it) on the radio. Each song has its own story and emotion.<br /><br />I love this album; it sits in CD changer in my car.<br />P.S. There is a bonus song at #12, and if you are still unsure about buying this album, you can listen to all the songs on youtube. You never know, your buddy might let you borrow it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game, i think anybody would want to play it I pointed it out to my mom and she downloaded it, and now she loves it.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|This dictionary is amazing, but the down side is is that it wont<br />Let you search for words instead it lets you look it up yourself!!!!
B0028KF4M4|3.0|There's a plot line around the D.A. (played by Jimmy Smits) that's just a little too comic book, for me, and makes this season versus earlier ones a little less compelling. Continued quality of production, and acting is there. Just a little B/B- in the writing.
B00AHQNHSY|3.0|These player seems to work most of the time. The videos I loaded to play didn't all work, but I soon realized the videos themselves were the problem.<br /><br />It's free and worth a try.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a great tool to help you publish your book on Kindle Direct Publishing. And it is absolutely free.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Ok I bought this movie on blind buy.  It is excellent pq and probably audio if I have a better audio system. The story was good to a point. For me it fell into the sci-fi trap. Where are this sci fi movies are good to man vs alien, man vs monster, man vs robot, man vs space virus? LOL. Others have said that it is a rip off of other movies. Ya it is when you examine it more. But in todays movie age, how many new ideas are out there? And when they are people or critics thrash it for some reason or other. Or the actor can't act in it or director is wrong for the movie.<br /><br />So again for most part I like it. Was it boring yes at times. If someone can tell me there top five sci fi movies that would be cool. Did I like it better than Moon.  I saw MOON and OBLIVION and I proclaim them about equal!  OOO please I hated 2001 it is very over rated and goofie IMHO. Not sorry about it either 2001 space fanboys. MOON is better than 2001. But that is another story to compare those two.
B00597A6NU|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The characters are so well defined. This is a must see movie.

B002KGEORM|5.0|I've enjoyed this series mostly because of the excellent characters. Though I was initially put-off by the subject, I'm really glad I gave it a try. I would recommend it to everyone.
1590171993|5.0|You should probably read this book. Something about it that is really enjoyable ... Just buy it and enjoy. Seriously.
B0013TPV0Q|4.0|A fun read for the summer, amusing and entertaining.  Doesn't make you think, just makes you smile and sometimes laugh.
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|good movie and just as the others, the team of characters keep you laughing and rooting for them to win win win
B000AYEL6U|5.0|As with many of the British dramas, there are layers to this story depending on how far you wish to go.  It can be guilty-pleasure romance, an exploration of the application of Christian values, a commentary on Industrialism and the working class, or a study in labor relations.  Don't be limited by these, find your own message; and along the way enjoy seeing Richard Armitage in a role vastly different than the ones he plays in Robin Hood or The Hobbit.
B0042X9L6A|5.0|the light is magnificent and i very happy to have it... i recommend to anyone!!  i hope has a good garantia
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Well done. I really enjoyed this series and I'm looking forward to watching the subsequent series. The characters are well developed and each episode was intriguing.
B005NFVZTM|5.0|I buy only DVD's I would like to watch only every so often, but watch over and over.  I have an eclectic mix, but they are my favorites.  Ordering was easy and the time to shipping and delivery was very reasonable.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|We all probably have our favorite interpretation of Jane Eyre; and each probably has an element of the &#34;best&#34; in it.  Toby Stephens has got to be the best Mr. Rochester ever done.  In addition, it a pleasure to see Ruth Wilson in a role she acknowledges was a rare and surprising offering to one as young and new as she was.  We didn't quite like where the story ended, but if you know what is left unsaid it won't be any more disappointing than the period I've left off this sentence
B004SVM7BW|1.0|A) I haven't used it yet.<br />B) if, when I do use it, I feel strongly enough about it, I will come and find you to give a review. Don't come begging for approval and expect to get it.<br />C) if there was less than a one star rating you would have gotten it. Please refer to the title of this review.
B006P96PAO|5.0|A movie that all families should watch together had me as a father doing alot of thinking and changes I needed to make in my life
B000ICZD4I|5.0|Got this just to have in my library.  Replacing all the VHS movies I have purchased over the years.  My VHS player has joined the technology history pile.  Now I have 2 regular DVD and 2 Blue-Ray DVDs.
080701429X|5.0|My immediate disclaimer has to be that I only read the first half of this book, the historical portion.  But, as an unvarnished record of one man's experience as a Jew under the Nazi's, it is a must read for all thoughtful people.  Frankl's ability to be the master of himself, amid the most controlling circumstances the world has ever known, needs to be an inspiration to us all.
B009RH973I|1.0|Product does not protect your kindle. I bought it for protection and the kindle easily cracked. Otterbox needs to make a case for the kindle.
B000VZFTDW|3.0|The main complaint I have with some of these Amazon songs is there are different versions and in this case there was a song add-on. There is a little part at the end of the song that I do not care for and would not have purchased it knowing it was there.
B00BSBUZT6|4.0|If you like the Eagles, you will love this.  The movie is interesting and fun to watch, although a bit sanitized with respect to the in-fighting. The bonus DVD of the Eagles in concert is neat although only an hour long.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|We have a whole collection of this type of story:  Jane Austen, Charles Dickins, Elisabeth Gaskill, and others.  Little Dorrit fits right in with them.  It's funny in places, touching in others, and has a variety of characters; some of whom will make you uncomfortable, but add a realism to the telling.  It has the darkness typical of a Dickins, rather than the sweetness of Austen, but ultimately takes care of the viewer and won't leave you feeling depressed.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|This might be the hardest adjustment for fans of the revamped Doctor Who series (2005 - present).  Christopher Eccleston was only around for one season and David Tennant picked up right where Eccleston left off while benefiting from the recurring characters that audiences were already familiar with.  This season is very different since the characters and plotlines present in the David Tennant era ended with his incarnation.  This season is more of a reboot as opposed to a continuation since there is a new Doctor, new TARDIS, new sonic screwdriver, new companions, and even new opening credits with an updated theme.  Fortunately, the writing remained excellent, which made the adjustment to all of the changes easier.  As the season progressed, I found myself liking Matt Smith and his companions more and more and, as usual, most of the episodes hint at an underlying plot that climaxes in epic fashion in the last two episodes.  The beginning of the season was a bit slow for me but that may have been because I was still trying to adapt to Smith and his new companion, Amy Pond (if I watched them again, I may feel differently).  However, I thought the season started heating up with \\"The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone\\", which sees the return of the Wheeping Angels and River Song.  \\"Amy's Choice\\" is another good one that puts the Doctor, Amy, and Rory in a dream sequence that really messes with your mind (this is one of my favorite episodes of the whole Doctor Who series).  \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" deserves a mention as well.<br /><br />In summary: if David Tennant is your favorite Doctor (like me), you might have a difficult time adjusting at first but hang in there - Matt Smith is better than you may think and the show benefits from excellent writing.  Besides, it's still Doctor Who so you're in for some great science fiction.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have pinned more then I will ever be able to do. It's awesome!!! It's great to pass time with.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Lots of fun. Can really get lost in this game. My little girl loves it. Helps her learn about money management while having fun. Even I love this game!! Passes time really fast.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No black and white. All characters have depth, in amazing shades of gray. The storytelling is compelling. It is one of the few programs or movies that I hate to see an episode end. While watching it, time disappears.
B006ANJ4BW|1.0|I don't know what to say... it SUCKS. I don't know why they made a remake. no words .... not watchable even for free. Don't wast your time.
B00004TDTO|5.0|This is such a nice movie! I wanted it in my collection and this movie fit the bill! I was received brand new and the product and price was exception! I love this movie and will view it over and over, its a must have classic!!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|This clock permanantly etches itself into your screen! Otherwise it wakes me up every morning. I like the display and you can adjust the brightness. The lowest setting may still be to bright for some people but I keep mine all the way up. You can wake up to alarm sounds or music from your phone. It also shows the weather and the day of the week. I'm a heavy sleeper and it is loud enough to wake me so I don't believe loudness should be a problem for anyone.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Great trilogy!  Three is better than all of them.  I've watched it so much with my 4 year old son that I practically know it line for line.  All three are just great, quality movies.  I have to say, though.  Buying it on Amazon left me wondering what I was going to get.  They lump the reviews of all of the Toy Story movies.  So just to let everyone know, this particular package is NOT 3D, but just Blu Ray.  I figured that was the case based on the price, so I went for it, but I wanted to let everyone else know as well.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie. Good action movie. If you don't mind bad acting .... it is what it is. A good fun movie.
0810983915|5.0|My daughter loves this series.  She can't wait to get the next one.<br />When she finishes reading them, she passes them on to her friends.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Awesome movie. ..... Thank you so much I loved it... Played great... Have passed it on for alot of friends to borrow...
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is really fun and gives me something to do in my usually boring day. :) Entertaining and pretty easy to understand. Love the fact that it's based around dragons and yeah. Pretty neat
B00992CF6W|4.0|it is a fun game but they need to add some redstone in the next update and some sticky pistons
B0083Z614S|4.0|I think this book was written to appeal to the young.  I am not young, but glad I read this light easy book.  It gives hope and joy.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Felt like I was back in 58 and let my mind wonder. King is such a great writer he really took me back in time.
B0056BMK6K|3.0|I liked this book and found the advice solid but after reading it I discovered complaints that he paid people to write reviews which wasn't mentioned. Because of this I gave it three stars. If it turns out he didn't pay anyone it'd be 4 stars. Overall it's still good advice to follow but you may not get his results.
0316201545|5.0|I enjoyed the first Land of Stories book, so I was looking forward to reading this one.  I wasn't expecting to be completely captivated with the story within the first few pages, but I was.  The Enchantress Returns was so excellent I had a hard time putting it down; I ended up finishing it in just two sittings.  The book is packed full of action and adventure, but there are some laugh out loud funny moments as well.<br /><br />Like the first book in the series, The Enchantress Returns features twins Alex and Conner, who are drawn into the fairy tale world.  The book contains many returning characters, along with some highly entertaining new ones.  Readers will be familiar with many of the characters, who are taken from classic fairy tales, but Chris Colfer puts his own unique spin on each of them.  He creates wonderful back-stories and weaves together the plots of seemingly disconnected fairy tales to create an entirely new fairly tale world based on all our old favorite stories.  I especially liked his take on Rumpelstiltskin, who features prominently in the book.<br /><br />The book is definitely appropriate for elementary school children, but it will also appeal to teens and adults of any age.  I felt the first Land of Stories book sometimes struggled to find a balance between being linguistically easy enough for kids to read and understand and being sophisticated enough to attract older readers.  The Enchantress Returns has no such issue.  While the writing remains simple, it is also smooth and beautiful.  The plot and the writing style will keep people reading.<br /><br />I hope more books in this series are planned.  After finishing The Enchantress Returns, I definitely want more!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|But of course most of Epics Apps are very good. It lights up neon with a cute tunes to go with it. Excellent game keep up the good work, and keep them levels coming.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Pretty decent game. There are frustrating parts but it does have a him  function. Worth it if you like search for the object games. It has a plot and voice acting.
B005IQZB14|5.0|A great and motivational story full of ups, downs and twists you would never expect. It is impossible to put down!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|The switching back and forth to the different time lines was confusing throughout the whole movie.  I don't recommend it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game consumes you like a plague!!! it's too much fun trying to wipe out the world, especially when you get to open up the zombie level. it's a great strategy game.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|This was an enjoyable read but just did not seem to be at the level of his previous 2 novels. Good character development but somewhat ocnfusing with all the changing of storyteller, time and places.
B007SSEZNA|5.0|This movie brought to the edge of your seat, yelling and talking to screen. It showed the true desperation of a young lady.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This show is the best combo of drama and music! Gives respect to theatre performance and also holds your attention with the storyline; lots of perspective.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I was addicted to this game and had reached level 38 when I had upgraded it to the &#34;ice land.&#34; That's when my game completely malfunctioned and I lost everything. So, suffice it to say, I was pretty mad. Thankfully I didn't spend any &#34;real&#34; money on the game. Still, it was quite a letdown.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I honestly thought it was going to be a better movie since the rates were high.. But still it was a good movie:)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like it, it is very entertaining simple but good for a free video game.  Some times it's very funny how stupidly simple it is.
B009WW1HUY|3.0|Great songs ruined by being over distorted and clipped. Part of a growing trend to make tracks louder for loudness sake. No dynamics.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Ok so I decided to get this app but its always slowing down and stopping to load,I don't recommend it just wastes your time
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Plague Inc is one of my favorite strategy games. And in my opinion one of the best of all time.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Love, Love, Love her and this film! Great film and a lot of fun.<br /><br />Great movie night movie for all.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Was a really good movie even Arnold did well acting . Well worth watching . Rate it between a three and four stars

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love love love love this game!!!! It was one of the first games I got on my kindle fire hd.
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|it came in its original packaging and the movie itself is one of the creepiest, ominous movies you can see to date.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|It is the Beatles....The songs are awesome.  Very heartfelt, and brings back a generation that we tend to have forgotten.
B003EI2EH2|3.0|I respect Tim Ferriss - I loved his 4-Hour Work Week - but his ideas about how to lose weight are kind of extreme. He is very interesting, because he's like a human research lab; he'll try anything! But I'm looking for something more natural. I don't do supplements, and I don't really want to eat weird stuff at weird times of the day just to fire up my metabolism, etc. So although this book is probably good for intense people, it's too edgy for me. I'll stick with Weight Watchers.
B00E0ZEDI6|5.0|For many Owl City fans I'll say that the original Midsummer Station record took a bit longer than its predecessor to love and enjoy. There are a handful of songs off TMS that I can't stop listening to but I still have a hard time playing it front to back in one sitting. I admire the production that went into the record but the hard-hitting sound just didn't compliment some of the songs.<br /><br />This acoustic EP is so much more representative of how I think the songs from TMS are supposed to make me feel. \\"Shooting Star\\" was never one of my favorites until now. I'm so glad that Adam made this EP, it really showcases so much of his musical talent and diversity. Not many artists today have the guts to strip down their tracks and rebuild them in an acoustic sound space. I thought when the acoustic EP was announced that it would just be guitar and vocals, not too exciting, but I was pleasantly surprised. I sat down for the midnight release on July 30th with my pair of Audiotechnica headphones and found myself surrounded by piano strings, soft synth pads, and some silky smooth vocals. It's brilliant.<br /><br />This EP is slow and relaxing and really brings songs like \\"Good Time\\" and \\"Gold\\" around full-circle. Now I have the originals for when I want to get up and moving but I also have the new acoustic versions for those late nights when I want to just hangout with some friends or read a book, take a bubble bath or watch the stars.<br /><br />I am convinced there is no end to Adam's creativity. There's nothing I love more than basking in the glow of some new tracks by my favorite artist.<br /><br />It's a lovely experience.<br /><br />-Alex<br /><br />P.S. I also totally lost it when I saw Hey Anna and I Hope You Think of Me would finally be released. My excitement for these two tracks cannot be overstated. Finally being able to listen to them is like waking up every morning and slathering my body in sunshine.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I like the actors who played the daughter and her security gaurd,  wonderful story i could watch this movie over and over
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Nice to have a salt water aquarium without the upkeep. Hard to gather needed pearls however.<br />Don't like to have to spend my hard earned money on a game.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I love this author so was anxiously awaiting the release of this book.  And I loved the first third of this book.  He is such an amazing writer.  But as I continued to read, I found too many threads in the story that never really gave me closure.  Off we'd go on a tangent and then it was never quite woven back into the story.. I do love the way this author writes though.  Boy, what a picture he paints with words.
B006N38104|5.0|Love this music! I have every album of this artist and I look forward to many more soon. Good music!
0425263924|5.0|this book was beyond anything I expected. I'm really looking forward to the next book but until then I'm rereading the series lol. please hurry Sylvia I'm desperate lol.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and the restored version makes it even better.  Beautiful scenery and wonderful acting, no wonder it won so many awards.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|So what is not to like and praise about this version on angry birds?  Nothing, from my point of view.  A fun game that will take more practice to totally master, but fun nevertheless.  I am certain that others, too, will find it good entertainment.
B007WKEM8C|5.0|Outstanding cookbook. Well written, accessible and most of all warm. Most recipes are innovative without being fierce or elitist.<br />I borrowed this from the library and will be making it a permanent part of my collection.
B00E193TM2|5.0|One of my favorites already. Not too sure about the \\"Mama said knock you out\\" remake, but better than most.
0765325950|5.0|One thing I love about the Wheel Of Time (one of many things, I assure you) is that the concept of togetherness they give for the couples involved. What I mean is: a couple dies or lives together. You'll find that if one half of a couple dies the other dies at the same time or shortly there after. I find it very heartbreaking but heartwarming at the same time. I also love the \\"No one is so lost in Shadow that they can't come again to the Light\\" theme involved here. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the way the series ended especially since I was never sure that it would end well at all especially with such an ominous sounding title for the last book.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This novel did for me what I thought the Harry Potter books should have done.  An amazingly drawn main character, who brought back the thrills and perils of being seven! The fantasy was believable in spite of its utter unbelievability.  Truly rich novel, one I was sorry to finish.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love to play this game. My granddaughter also at 4 years old is a Temple Run 2 champion!! This game is fun and exciting for all ages.
0670026557|5.0|There are three styles of social interaction concerning reciprocity:  Takers, who take more than they give in life; matchers who give tit for tat; and givers, who give to help others. When it comes to who wins and who loses in life, researcher and author Adam Grant concludes that givers do both--win and lose. A Wharton professor, Grant makes some powerful observations to support his descriptions and analysis of all three types; ultimately, he concludes that \\"otherish\\" givers (generous but sensible) come out on top every time. Losing givers (overly selfless givers) were those who gave too much to others at their own expense,  earned 14% less, were twice as likely to be victims, and were 22 percent less powerful than either matchers or takers. In the book, Grant describes the difference between these two types of givers: The champs and the chumps!<br /><br />Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success (Viking/Penguin Group, 2013) by Adam Grant, reviewed by Steve Gladis, PhD, August 2013.

B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Neil Gaiman's special gift (among many, to be clear!) is that he is able to walk his novels along the fine line of truly frightening images from the nightmare edges of our fears but not ever to topple over the edge into an abyss (of hopelessness) or macabre fantasticality. For readers of Grimm Bothers fairytales, the worlds they described and the creatures and people who walked there were familiar and real. Gaiman's characters walk and talk with the fears and anxieties we are very familiar with. They are our. The creatures - the doubts - that creep and crawl at the edges of their imaginations are just as familiar to us. So the anonymous narrator - a child - finds that when a stranger accidentally kills his sister's kitten and then suicides in the family car, something alien and frightening sneaks into their house, and transfigures it - changing his apparently safe environment into one that contains threats of which his parents are not only unaware, but compromised by and vulnerable to. That these threats are fantastical, but clothed in guises very familiar to us - sexual betrayal and violence - makes the walk on the edge of night mare all the more 'real'. Gaiman apparently writes for children. Or perhaps, adults who remember what it is to be a child (or who want to!). It makes his books vivid, refreshing and very, very important both for helping children deal with real terror that walk in their imaginations as much as their daily lives, and for adults who need to understand this!

B00B52FDXQ|5.0|If you haven't already seen this amazing series... My God, what are you waiting for?!<br /><br />Anyway, here's the part where I give my warning about spoilers and such. Okay, you've been warned :D<br /><br />Premise: History will say that Spartacus is the story of a gladiator slave turned rebel leader. But for the sake of the series, I'll say it's the story of a free man, a warrior, turned into a gladiator who said he isn't going to take this s*** any longer and became a rebel leader, then legendary hero.<br /><br />When this series first debuted several years ago, I was a bit skeptic. The special effects didn't impress me from the trailers I'd seen, but still, I was going to give it a chance. After I watched the pilot, I was hooked! Addicted! Strung-out during season breaks and having all kinds of withdrawal symptoms until its return.  This has got to be one of the greatest television shows ever written, acted, directed... created. There is something for everyone in this series. Do you love romance? Yeah, it has it. Tragic at times and even morbid, but romance is often blooming. If you love sex scenes, then you get that by the buckets. But if intrigue, action, blood, guts and battles are your cup of tea, then sit down for a full serving because this particular show glorifies in violence unlike any other.<br /><br />If you don't know me by now, that's JUST my thing. I love when a show has everything I could ever hope for. The plot lines were always unpredictable, even when you knew the history of some of the characters, and that's not an easy feat on the part of the writers/creators. Each episode was action-packed and loaded with devilish schemes sure to keep any viewer thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />Special Note: The main actor who portrayed Spartacus originally fell ill before they could continue onto the second season, so they created a prequel to give him time to heal. Unfortunately, Andy Whitfield passed away from cancer. Broke many fans hearts including Yours Truly. I do have to take my hat off to the creators for coming up with a fantastic prequel that gave us the amazing gladiator, Gannicus. Also, they found  another wonderful actor to take up the torch and continue to blaze Spartacus' trail.<br /><br />The final season wrapped up early this year, so now you can watch back-to-back episodes at your leisure and immerse yourself in this barbaric world of ancient Rome to your heart's content.<br /><br />Grade:  A++++ I'm nominating you for class Valedictorian.<br /><br />[...]<br />For more movie review go to: [...]to the creators for coming up with a fantastic prequel that gave us the amazing gladiator, Gannicus.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|Warning: This review will contain spoilers, but I'll try my best not to give too much away.<br /><br />Premise: Zod and his cohorts were sentence to the \\"Phantom Zone\\" for their crimes against Krypton and right before the planet explodes, they are sent away. But they weren't the only Kryptonians to vacate the planet before its inevitable doom. Jor-El and his wife managed to send their only son, the last natural birth son of Krypton to Earth so that he may live, and with him goes all the hopes and dreams and the future of Krypton. Of course, Zod and his brood escape the Phantom Zone and find themselves on Earth to raise hell and rebuild Krypton. It's up to one man to make sure that doesn't happen.<br /><br />(I tried not to give too much away in the premise.)<br /><br />Okay, for those of you who don't already know this about me, I am a HUGE Superman fan. I have every movie, cartoon, and TV series ever made. I even enjoyed watching the 1980's Superboy TV series and if you've ever seen a clip of that, you know just how much of a fan one would have to be to tune into that show every week. Have I read every comic book? No. But that's only because I'm not a comic book reader, but I know his origins and his story just like every other Superman expert.<br /><br />Now, having said that, I must say the \\"Man of Steel\\" was THEE Superman I've been waiting for my entire life! I know there's a huge controversy out there regarding the ending of the movie, but that's one of the parts I loved the most. Superman was created in the 30's and let's face it, there was a LOT of injustice going on during that time that was never reflected in the origins of his stories. So a part of me always felt his personality was outdated. Fighting for \\"Truth, Justice and The American Way\\" leaves a lot open to questions, such as; What is the \\"American Way\\"? How was America founded? That should be the first question you have to ask yourself and the answer isn't necessarily the way Superman should go. One man's truth is another man's lie and One person's Justice is another person's injustice, which is why people are falsely accused and criminals get away with committing crimes. It's a tricky thing that's not always black and white. There are many shades of gray in between.<br /><br />So let's face it, Superman needed a 21st century reboot and fast! Thank goodness Director Zack Snyder and writer David S. Goyer knew exactly what to do. Superman may be Kryptonian by birth, but all of his ideals are human because that's all he's ever known.  He was raised by humans, loved by them, he's grown up watching them fight and die to protect their family, land, county and those who can't protect themselves. So this is what he should believe in, this is what he should uphold. And in the \\"Man of Steel\\", he did.<br /><br />This movie pushed Superman to his limits and it was nice to see him use his abilities to the max. He was paired with villains that left absolutely no room for peaceful negotiations and Superman had to open several cans of whoopass on the lot of them. There was tons of action from beginning to end and I think I sat there in the show with a cheesy grin on my face like the Joker the entire time. I really loved how they did the flashbacks because we didn't need yet another movie showing us how Clark Kent grew to be Superman from the moment he was discovered by Johnathan and Martha Kent. We have the Christopher Reeves Superman for that and the awesome TV show \\"Smallville\\". So they didn't beat us over the head with his childhood into adulthood, but instead gave us pertinent flashbacks that helped tell his story and the beliefs he had as an adult.<br /><br />The plot was solid, the action was packed and it doesn't apologize in the least for getting your blood pressure pumped and your heart racing. I can appreciate that. :D<br /><br />And Henry Cavill was supersexy as Superman. All I can say is; bring on Man of Steel 2 and then the Justice League!!!<br /><br />Grade: A +++ I'm inducting you into the Honors Society!++ I'm inducting you into the Honors Society!

B003PGNBO8|4.0|I don't watch these serial programmes on television but buy them years later to view.  As such I watched the entitr series for the first time on dvd.<br />Flash Forward is entertaining, and the actors do an excellent job.  One can see that money was spent to provide good special effects and sets.<br />Everything has to be viewed as fiction, as the story is full of events that are highly unlikely and not very plausible.  I kept wondering why the writers would assume viewers would not question the lack of security at various offices and installations, as one example.<br />Unfortunately, the series ends rather quickly without answering most of the questions it makes.  There really is no ending or conclusion to every one of the major and minor subplots.  The viewer is simply left hanging.  The last few minutes of the last episode presents even more questions suggesting that the series will continue next season to address these and finish all the open questions the viewer is left with.  Did the network cancel Flash Forward?<br />So, enjoy an entertaining programme knowing that like so many other television series it will end incomplete.

B00AEUU4LQ|3.0|I appreciate the author's intentions. But the inter as well as intra-chapter flashbacks make for a very confusing read. Even before I finished the book, I figured I would have to re-read it as soon as I was done to piece things together more logically.

B008JFUO4U|3.0|Tom Cruise plays the last man on Earth, a high-tech janitor of sorts who's left to mind the planet's robotic chaperones while the rest of the species lives it up on one of Saturn's moons. It's slow, predictable and riddled with holes, but the production's cache of slick, attractive future tech and constant visual revelations make for excellent diversions. Cruise's sleekly designed equipment is a real science fiction goldmine, visionary in the same sense as Minority Report's giant touch-screen UIs, and the first hour is an outstanding lesson in world-building. The plot eventually falls into too many Cruise / mainstream Hollywood pitfalls, though, and borrows too liberally from other films. Duncan Jones's excellent Moon, in particular, is robbed of all but its subtlety, performances and locale. Still, such faults are hardly surprising by this point and if you were anticipating something more... well, maybe an adjustment in expectations is in order. Perfectly acceptable as a conceptual exercise, but make sure you swallow that grain of salt before viewing.

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I just took a class about Hitchcock so I was excited to see this movie. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, but I'm not sure how historically accurate it is. Anthony Hopkins did a great job with his impersonation of Hitch, but he talked a little too fast. The story was interesting. I can understand why the movie covers Psycho so intensely, since that's really the film we think of first when we think of Hitchcock, but I was hoping the movie would be more of a biography about his life, and it wasn't.  His wife Alma (Helen Mirren) did an excellent job, and really stole the movie for me both with her fabulous acting, as well as her excellent portrayal of one of Hitch's biggest influences. The crowning scene of the movie (big props to Hopkins) for me was when Hitch tries to show Norman Bates, during filming, how to express more emotion whilst stabbing the lovely Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johannson). It really showed of Hopkin's acting skill, as well as reminding the audience of Hitchcock's control issues. I also liked how, throughout the movie, Hitch maintained a dialogue with the original murderer from the book Psycho is based on. I think that all brilliant minds have a little bit of crazy in them, and although the history books now seem to omit this part of Hitch's personality, it was probably evident at the time. The score is well done for the film (Danny Elfman strikes again, and you can totally tell it's him from the first note you hear), but March of the Marionettes (Hitch's \\"signature\\" theme) is played just a little too fast. After hearing it over and over again, the altered tempo really bothered me. But enough nitpicking - read a book about Hitchcock, see some of his films, and then watch this movie and judge for yourself.
B006ZNRD06|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire along with an anime watcher, and I have to say, it's really good. I find that most episodes that turn out weird (audio out of sync, jumps, etc) are a result of a faulty source, not the player. And even then, those are very rare.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was my first introduction to Gillian Flynn and I am now hooked. She has such a descriptive style that allows the reader to become completely immersed in the story and invested in the characters. I look forward to what Gillian will bring to the table in the future.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is not normally the kind of book I read but something about it (starting with the cover) got me curious. I hate giving away the story so let me say that the two main characters are simple (in a good way) and endearing. Their circumstances are very different, yet there is something that unites them. At a certain point they are brought together—but not in a way you would expect. Sorry, but you'll just have to read the book to find out. Do it. You'll be rewarded with a good read.

Then I quickly red her others book, &#34;House of Riverton&#34;, and &#34;The Distant Hours&#34;, and were disappointed. The endings were only based on bad luck and misunderstandings that led to misfortunes. As a reader of pretty many pages, I felt tricked - and that I had wasted my time. But «The Secret Keeper» was great. The characters were loveable and understandable. And the ending was so superb, that as soon as I was finished the book, I red it one more time.<br />The book has two storylines. In present time we follow Laurel who as a teenager witness her mother kill a man. Now, at her mother´s deathbed, she tries to find the answer to what really happened back then. And - the other storyline tells the story about Dorothy, the mother, and her life during the World War 2, and what happened between her and the people surrounding her then. i loved it.

B00457X7IQ|3.0|This is not one of the best books on this saga for me, but you must go through with it to enjoy the others. The develop of the plot is a little bit too slow for me. However, being true to the tittle, this is the darkest of all. Hence, it can make you feel a little depresed and powerless at times; yet at the end the path is worth taking. In conclusion, I recommend it. If you liked the first one, you defenitely have to buy this one; there is no other way.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I had bought this for my brother for Christmas and then after trying it out went and bought it for myself!

B0023SDQB2|4.0|I found this book to be very hard to get into. I like to get caught up in the books I read, to be transported into the pages, and this one just didn't do that for me. I suppose it was because I knew it was based on fact and most of the people were real, which gave it a non-fiction feel. However, I have read  many other books of historical fiction that blew me away and had me believing that it happened the way the author portrayed it.<br />I thought Regeneration was a good story, but hard to read. I really wanted to like it. I hope that the series gets better in the next book. I have read reviews that say it has less of a textbook feel as you get deeper in the trilogy.<br /> I hope so. I thought the author did a really good job of fleshing out the characters in the book. They were all very much three dimensional. I could feel their anguish and almost see what they were going through. For that reason, I liked the book and would recommend it to anyone who was interested in the WW 1 time period.

B005LJK3AC|3.0|Rented this movie late one night, not expecting much but just hoping to be mildly entertained before falling asleep. I was pleasantly surprised. Kevin Spacey and Jennifer Aniston are hysterical in supporting roles as the titular bosses. Jason Bateman, Jason Sudekis, and that guy from Always Sunny are also great together. It's not the funniest movie you'll ever see, but if you're bored and looking for something to watch this comedy has more than a few laughs in it.

This time his coactor plays the rolle of his son on the movie and does great as an action guy too, the scenarios are excelent, the light, the coreography on fights, etc, Just a little detail I like a little less: The verty long car chasing scene, but all the rest is excellent.<br />I was specting this movie for a long time and when I saw it I get very very very pleased.<br />If you like action moovies, this is a MUST HAVE.<br />Excelent I gave 5 stars.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|It came across as a &#34;had to make it because of contractual requirements&#34;. I have no clue as to the reasoning behind this flick...but it was pretty poorly executed in my opinion. Flat, no emotion, and terrible pacing. Which is a shame....because I am a fan of Singer and his work.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Old game with new twist I can even play a game with my daughter, even doe we MILES away, I can still spend time with my kid and have fun doing it thanks Gameloft. If you are mom or dad with kids and distance between you this is for you. Or play with family and friends and even make new friends.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|A nice movie from Tom Cruise, It is more like an csi theme than an action movie but it is ok, I havn't read the book but this movie will cover your spectations on entertainment.<br />if you like action and suspense you could love it. And must of all, this is not a predictable movie like other action movies.
0061914177|5.0|I've only read about half of this book and it is Incredible I can't wait to finish it Thank You Very much
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|I thought Schwarzenneger was on retirement as an action hero, but in this movie he does great.<br />He don't show their muscles this time (he is an old guy) or fall from a 5 story building or chase some one running but you can say it is a very good action movie.<br />The story is very simple, very plain but all actors do a great job and you can spend a nice evening watching this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's kinda like temple run but with minions and you go different places.you should really get this game!it's really fun and kid friendly, I let my little sisters play and they absolutely love it.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Excellent app love it does it all would recommend it to all my friends in a heartbeat.I use this for all my photo editing and it does the job very well 5star rating !
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great job by Dave Grohl presenting the history of Sound City recording studio. I heard it won some award at the Sundance Music Festival, that's how I heard about it.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Old Man's War was a space marines story.  The second one was about the black ops-type branch of the space military.  This is more of a settlers in an old western-style story, with big bads coming.  Except in space.  Fun and adds more depth to characters from the earlier books.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Since the update, none of my ebooks purchased are downloading. It says that the books have been downloaded but unsure where?!? It also force closes and shuts down my Android.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|it is the best game ever.lots of blood my shark is always starting but I stol love it so awesome.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This app is great. you can use your phones flash for LED bright light or chose a softer light which emits from your touch screen side. Also comes with COP flashing lights to mess with friends while driving. Put the phone next to their rear window and what they see in their rear view mirror would be funny to witness. :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was kinda a dark read with secrets and life changing moments that really tears at your heart strings! I loved I mean LOVED Holder! He was just so passionate and caring for Sky and just right by her side even though he was going thru so much as well! This book seriously made me cry and feel for the characters so much! I really was right there with Sky the entire time and It was just such an amazing love story!! I will definitely be recommending this to book buddies! Loved this story!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This was a great game and can't wait for the next one to come out. I wasn't able to play it all at once, was very hard to put down as you get drawn into the game. Wish it had lasted longer, but we'll worth playing!
B001NHNG64|4.0|Came across the Jack Reacher novels after seeing the movie.  I started with the first and have enjoyed them this far. Little slow moving but overall I enjoyed it.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a fun game, but it takes a while to load. Also, it takes a while to register that I have jumped, turned, or slid. So by the time it registers, my minion has bumped into somthing and the game is over. If it didnt have this problem, then I would rate it five stars.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Thought this book moved along quickly and all the character's stories came together great by the end of the book.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It is nail biting book and its a saga. I love the book so I can not wait for the movies. This is my favorite saga ever . So far. LLOOOVVVVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEE  IITTT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Or just plain LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is challenging and addictive. I wish there were an infinite amount of levels (floors).<br /><br />However, it doesn't save your settings or your place in the game. If you leave the game, you have to reset Options (sound off) and start all over. You can choose the level on which you were previously working but no progress is saved. Very frustrating if you left before solving the entire level.<br /><br />Since the game was so much fun, I put up with the negatives.
B003N7ORNI|5.0|This is an amazing book and series. I think it's almost as good as the percy jackson series but..... you will know when you read ittttt.
B008Y7DV70|3.0|Love the cast, but a little too &#34;outre&#34; to keep someone who likes their movies full of action not thought.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|If it could happen this is the way it would happen... Foster played it exactly correctly... the casting people know their business.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I am new at this and could not find instructions to start a new game when there were no more plays
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like everything from the opening music to the ending credits.  The only disappointing feature of this series, was the loss of the character Mathew.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Halfway through was when I couldn't put it down! Learned a few things about history and the Soviet point of view.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|It only lasted one season, but it was a decent season.<br /><br />I liked how it started.<br /><br />Though it was set in Space, it was sort-of down-to-Earth, with the people interacting not only with questionable trader-types but with locals who seemed very much like some bygone eras on Earth. To make it feel even more homey, some of the actors added a bit of a country-western accent, which seemed to get heavier as the season progressed.<br /><br />Acting was decent. Characters were interesting. Writing was good at times. The series typically has both a fun seriousness to it, and some humor. Special effects weren't bad for the time period.<br /><br />Alternative lifestyles (for its time) were explored a bit (PG-13ish at times). Cussing was sort of euphemized (using alternative words instead, almost like an edited-for-TV film is). Sex was at a minimum (only a couple of PG-13+ scenes). Ethics were stretched. Morality was off in the Galaxy elsewhere, set in the future. It is one of the higher-rated TV shows, with a sort of cult following (in the gentle sense).<br /><br />And finishing the entire season made me want more episodes! (After this, there was a sort of movie, called, I think, Serenity.)<br /><br />There are 14 episodes from 2002-2003, in either HD or Standard Definition.<br /><br />I watched the series on Amazon Instant Video, in mid-2013. During that time it was free for Amazon Prime members.<br /><br />Enjoy Firefly!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Had never watched until on Amazon Prime and show is fantastic! Highly recommend to watch four all seasons. Captivating show!  Must See!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|best tool for coordinating data across multiple devices. makes it easy to access what you need anywhere. I use it to capture notes on everything.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Great sci-fi series, and while there are some plot-holes that are laughable the writing is generally compelling.  Hope this inspires more sci-fi.
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|The sets, the photography, the costumes, the storyline, and most of all the supreme casting especially Jeremy Irons, Caesare, Lucrezia, and the mother played by Joanne Whalley make this the type of series I could have watched far beyond three seasons. What a gross mistake to take this series down after the third season.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It's heart warming and very very funny........oh my gosh, the cardboard \\"Box of Shame\\" at the orphanage was too much!<br />I laughed out loud!  Will definitely watch it again and again!
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Was surprised how good this movie wasn't. It was alright but Mr. Knoxville pulled thru and kept me laughing and not turning it off
B004UPANAI|4.0|I love to live outside of the normal and these certainly provide that for me.  I'll watch them all and probably buy them all.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|A revealing insight into life in the era of kings and queens who fought for their rights of their kingdom in the year 1400s....At times it takes thinking back to previously read sections as new generations emerge with children being named after their ancestors often cousins marrying to stay within the family kingdom having the reader question who a certain character&#34;s relationship was to the monarchy....
B001JIHGO0|4.0|I laughed so many times.  We had our dvd stolen so I replaced it with blue ray and hadn't seen it for a couple of years.  It's one I will watch again.  The expressions were priceless.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Outstanding plot construction, character development, dialogue and videography. I could not stop watching Season 1 until I had seen all the episodes.
B008Y6YCB0|5.0|If you like \\"chick flick\\" movies that take place in historical times, this one is excellent. Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent as always and understatedly funny. I think I just made up that word, (understatedly) but her sense of comedic style is very dry, so it takes a moment to hit you and then you just laugh and laugh! Loved the sets, the costumes, and the story. She plays a matchmaker of sorts without any expectation that she, herself, may one day fall in love. I enjoyed every minute of this film and the entire cast was superb. Highly recommend for a nice afternoon-relaxing-with-a-movie kind of day.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Outstanding plot construction, character development, dialogue and videography. I could not stop watching Season 2 until I had seen all the episodes. It was better then Season
B00DP3IGJ6|3.0|This movie was OK. It wasn't great, wasn't terrible, just OK. This isn't the most compelling review, but this wasn't the most compelling movie.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|The CD is awesome. Perfect condition. Although when I first opened the CD case for the first time plastic pieces directly in the middle of the CD part of the case broke. No big deal though. I had another case laying around that I could put it in.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I recently repurchased a used DVD of phantom b/c my copy disappeared and I was instantly impressed with the speed of delivery and the quality of the disc
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|Very cute game. Even my 3 year old can play it. Wish it was easier to get hearts without having to connect with people.
B009PNQUXO|5.0|I love this this YOURTUBE app, I download movies from youtube and watch them when I am in a waiting room are anywhere, when there is no WiFi,and I have time to burn[[ASIN:B009PNQUXO Your Tube - Downloader]]
B004HO6I4M|4.0|A cute movie but nothing spectacular,  Enjoyable, but didn't require multiple viewings.  Again, it was a gift for our Grandson, and once he watched it, he was finished.
1595827684|5.0|I like collecting video game artbooks and I absolutely had to have this one in my library. Being such a huge fan of the series, I liked how the Bioware team created the look of the game's universe. Would recommend to every Mass Effect fan!
B00A83075M|5.0|Bought this for my 6 year old Grandson's birthday, and we had to watch it 4 times in one weekend.  He just wanted to watch &#34;Wreck-It Ralph&#34; over and over.
B005HCI72O|4.0|Well researched and written. Just long enough but at times the violence was a tad too brutal for my own taste. I understand that it is correct in the greater storytelling of the time though.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I love the game it is basically like temple run but with minions and different power-ups so that's cool. Unfortunately I can't get it to load on my Kindle Fire very often.
B00742GBDM|2.0|In the effort to modernize Fanny Price, her velveted, solid strength is lost..and that was the whole point of the character in Jane Austin's book.  A good reason to read literature from another era is to gain perspective on our own.  In making Fanny a more accessible, modern young woman (in funny clothes), we lose this perspective.  The inclusion of the slave aspect was insufficient to do anything but cause us horror; Sir Thomas' repentance at the end was given little fathomable motivation... simple emotion, which is not lasting and not satisfactory.  Shoe-horning the whole story into a couple of hours resulted in losing the motivations for most of the characters' choices, giving us a story, but no plot.  Overall, a disappointment.
1401223176|5.0|I loved it barely getting into comics n let's just say I'm amazed. I've been a Batman fan my whole life but never had any comics when I was young. Now sense I make my own money I can enjoy these works of art n story telling genius. If u are a fan of batman get this book. U won't be disappointed
B00821PCJS|5.0|It is a very well put together series. We loved it. We would recommend this series to our friends. Thrilling!
B00DQVST76|5.0|No one does better than QUEEN M......This show is magnificent, aw inspiring, beautiful, sexy, inspiring, controversial, fun, and a total blast.........a nonstop feast for the eyes and the ears........a must have.... THERES IS ONLY ONE QUEEN AND THATS MADONNA........
B00DURILJ2|4.0|Mud is a movie about two boys, Ellis and his friend Neckbone who find a man named Mud hiding out on an island in the Mississippi. Mud describes fantastic scenarios-he killed a man in Texas and vengeful bounty hunters are coming to get him. He says he is planning to meet and escape with the love of his life. Skeptical but curious, Ellis and Neckbone agree to help him.<br /><br />Although the movie at times dragged a little and I thought a bit too long, the story was entertaining and was well acted.<br /><br />Matthew McConaughey, Tye Sheridan, Jacob Lofland all did excellent acting jobs and were very believable in their roles. The movie gave the true feel of riverboat life. Although the action part of the movie happened mostly towards the end, it was worth waiting for the climax.<br /><br />Mud is definitely a worthwhile watch and a good dramatic suspense movie with a touch of action thrown in.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Marvellous interweaving of very disparate characters and their stories.  He loves his characters.  I will definitely read his next book, but not right away.  Something to come back to later.
B005K17RU0|2.0|I hit the wrong town and I can't delete it. I will have to delete the app!!! This makes me very sad!!!
B000002KAT|5.0|There are some truly great reviews on this that beautifully analyze the depth of the music on this album which I cannot add to.  However, I feel strongly enough about my own experince with this album that I wanted to share it and hope that others who have not done so might bring this album into their lives.<br /><br />Although I had been listening to this album for years and it was already my favourite record that I had ever heard, it took new meaning for me when my father passed away whilst I was away on business.  Whilst travelling home to the funeral, I put this album on my ipod on the plane.  Sweet Thing came on.  In my mind Sweet Thing was already the greatest song ever recorded.  However I cannot explain what happened onn this journey, it was spiritual.  I listened to this song on repeat the entire 7 hour flight.  Something magical occured, the lyrics were speaking to me.  Happy memories were flooding back, appreciating the good times rather and taking away some of the pain.  I remembered times walking in misty rain in Belfast with him, Cyprus Avenue, a stones throw from the home my dad was raised in, comforted me.  I credit this song with giving me the emotional strength to get home.  To this day, it still connects me spiritually with my dad.<br /><br />God bless you Van, you sweet thing.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|The actors are great at doing their thing in a nonchalant way.  I love action movies & these stars.  I can't wait for the next one.
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|I bought this for my nephews I was not crazy about the movie but they really liked it so it must be OK.
B008602KQI|5.0|I do like adventures.  My daughter told me about this move & so I decided to see it.  Turns out she was right.  It was a great move.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I its a great move lots of laughs. I think the whole family will enjoy it I know we did thats why I bought the DVD.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|It's hard to include time for the scope of the scenery of Iceland in this film without slowing down the story a bit, which this movie does.  Nothing new in terms of chase scenes and sci-fi droids attacking humans, but there is an interesting Sci-Fi premise in the story and the film is beautifully crafted.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Just such a well written novel, even after re-reads and years, it still holds up so well. Definitely one of my favorite books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I bought this for my 5 year old. And I play it more than him. It is fun, easy to play. Collecting the bananas are simple enough, and short enough to keep his attention.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Kind of reminds me of the Walton's TV show, great story line and believable characters.  This show deals with 1980's England.
B00ABO573A|4.0|I really enjoyed the main actor's performance. He's not your typical leading man and he's truly an excellent actor. I also liked the relationships and the storyline. Although it's a bit depressing. Not  brilliant script, but rather true to life and relationships, especially gay ones.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|A lot of fun and quite creative. Just wish u didn't have to start each level over from the beginning every time you're killed. Still a lot of fun.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|If you are a fan of the Fellowship of the Ring by Tolken - you will like it I am sure
0425263916|5.0|If you love 50 shades, you'll love the Crossfire series ..... Great story line, couldn't put it down till the end!
B00BI745AA|5.0|Les Mis - what can you say - I have seen it in many forms and this is a good one - Great performances by all.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|You can only play a certain number of games before it wants you to pay for them.  Way too many ads for a pay for play game.  The game itself would be fun on its own.  Wouldn't mind the ads either so much.  Terrible!
B00DM12ANO|5.0|Great movie .Dunst marveled in this.!! I think the story was brilliant !, with a Great ending ^^^  looking for more stories from these worlds ^^^
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|This game is fantastic on multiple levels. Of course, it looks great and runs smoothly. But, more importantly, it's got a very simple core mechanic with a lot of room for skill and strategy. That core mechanic is enhanced by the power-ups that open up as you advance in the game. I have found this game a lot of fun to play, and just the right level of difficulty. Additionally, Tasharen Entertainment provided a quick response when I accidentally uninstalled the game and lost my account. They sent me a code to get it back within a couple of hours. Two thumbs up.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|\\"Let Her Go\\" has been a Number 1 song in 16 countries for good reason.  The U.S.A. is about to discover what all the fuss is about.  A great album by a fine singer/songwriter.
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Some of the most famous actors of the time, in a film that is truly a Classic. Bogart at his best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game. It's one of my favorite games. It's very addicting. Hate having to stop playing it when I go to work.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Great flick. Good for kids. It's one if my daughter's favorites. We really enjoy the music and all the vibrant colors. Some crude humor.
B009DCOU9S|3.0|This game is ok. A little simple. More for children then for adults. finished the entire game in just a couple hours
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That boy really has some sweet one liners - &#34;you are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.&#34;
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|Great little tetris-y game, good for zoning out. Feels intuitive and rewarding. I have recommended it to a couple of my friends
B001XUIBNO|5.0|John Huston is the best villain ever in this. 'Just find the girl...'  Also a visually beautiful movie. I am inspired to see (or re-see) more of Dunnaway and Nicholson during this era.
B00BBW16HW|3.0|This movie was just okay to me.  The acting was very good but the story was weak in my personal opinion.
B00E8B1P9M|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS FOR THE MILITARY, PARA-MILITARY, AND THOSE WHO DO FOR OTHERS, THAT CANNOT DO FOR THEMSELVES.  AND ITS ALWAYS EXCELLENCE WITH AN NCO AT THE LEAD, FOR NCO'S ARE THE BACK-BONE OF ANY ORGANZATIONS.
B00DCX08MW|3.0|graphics and sound are good.  control buttons not very clear on my Kindle Fire.  Lacks yaw control -- KF problem?  slow response to motion control often needs to over compensate -- KF?
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I'm using this product with my old nexus 7 and my nexus 4 and I can tell you that it works great.<br />Netflix and youtube streaming quality is seamless.<br /><br />You won't find by far a better product at this price range.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|Though this &#34;one night only&#34; became a tour of many nights over the course of the next year this song cycle reminds us of the staggering contribution this trio made to popular music.  Oh and they actually sang live!
1455803197|5.0|Great reading.  Very entertaining.  Rick Riordan has done it again!  This story takes you through unimaginable worlds where you will have find yourself on the edge of your seat on each turn of a page.  Exciting, suspenseful, witty.  A must read.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|I read this just before I went to Australia.  While my experience was very different from Bryson's, I loved the history and cultural insights in his book.  This is one of Bryson's most hilarious books.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling  is an amazing artist. This album was well worth the money and I am very glad to own it.
0811879542|5.0|This book is great for the young child with suspense as each page is read.  Wonderful interaction!! Try it, you will like it!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is really fun. I enjoy playing it in my free time. I recommend this game for texting people
B001NB4Z6K|5.0|If you want the best of U2, this is it from those years. If you like some of the other songs that weren't big hits, you will need to get the other albums, but to just get their best, you cant go wrong with this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Even though you can't change your skin it is the best game ever. I recommend this game to EVERYONE. I hope you guys found this comment helpful.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|his songs from recently leaving Genesis to his best solo work. All these songs represent Phil, you cant go wrong with this choice.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Something I really like is that I can combine water, chimes or anything I want with music I love at the same time. I just use Relax Melodies with another radio app!!
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Wow, some of these songs take me back to my younger years, and get my blood pumping like before. If you like Fleetwood Mac, and you don't have all their albums, then you need this one.
B002HLM4E0|5.0|This is teh book that started the billion dollar industry. It is worth the billions. It makes children read. Thank you
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this for my kindle over a year ago and it's still great.  I have dropped it once but the plastic case sure did its job.  I really love the sturdy plastic backing and that it's not too bulky.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This movie is awesome! The rental itself was of good quality with hardly any service interruption or buffering. Fast, easy and convenient to get the movies I like to rent.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I can see it many and many times!!! :)<br /><br />Honestly much better than the second one. Wish someday they create a CGI series.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I had just about given up on television when a friend suggested Breaking Bad.  He said that the actor from Malcolm in the middle plays a teacher turned Meth cook. I remember thinking to myself, &#34;really?&#34;, it didn't sound very watchable.  I pretty much gave it 5 episodes to hook me.<br /><br />A month later I have watched almost every episode and I am about to start watching the last season that I have saved on my DVR.  It is a GREAT show.  Bryan Cranston is fantastic and the story is like a book you can't put down.<br /><br />See this!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Loved the series and loved the books all of them.  This tied up the loose ends and brougt about a satisfying end to a 3 year investment I have made in the lives of these charactes.  Brandon Sanderson did an excellent job of picking up where Robert Jordon left off.  The characters and themes were true to Robert Jordons epic.  Now I have to follow Brandon Sanderson in his own novels.  Look forward to reading more form this writer.
B00DQR26EC|4.0|This is a great game the only problem is that every now and then the game will freeze and the screen will turn black and I have to restart my kindle fire so it is recommended that you save often
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|so far it is go and I love the puzzles. and mystery too.  so get it if u like it
B003XRELGQ|5.0|A beautifully written book with an absolutely wonderful ending. I can't recommend this book enough to anyone looking to fall in love with Vonnegut's work.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I learned about Fault of Our Stars when my daughter's friend posted on FB that the main character reminded him of Christina. Intrigued, I read the book. I discovered a fresh, down to earth portrayal of a 16-year-old cancer patient's observations and reflections about her experience.<br /><br />This is a beautifully written book: funny, poignant, and insightful. It did remind me of things Christina would have said.<br /><br />For those of you that think, this kind of thing doesn't really happen in real life. I was one of you before my daughter died. And truly, things like this do happen.
B00B2QA646|4.0|I did enjoy this movie. They seemed to hit all of the major points of the book.<br /><br />No complaints from me.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I recently just purchased my third rifle scope that uses these batteries, even when I had 2...paying $4.97 for a bargain brand from the Walton's got old quick. Now, for half the price, I can keep a 5 pack in each range bag and never be left blind.
B00B5A9FOG|5.0|I enjoyed this amazing production,the actors,costumes,special effects and ;location. I did not understand the signifiance of the last scene.with Merlin walking along the road.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great subject matter.  Outstanding locations and filming.<br /><br />Good historic reference, and very graphic.<br /><br />Mature subject matter.<br /><br />One of the best series I have seen on TV.
B003K16P3M|5.0|This book is action packed, has great character building, and is an inventive unique story. If you like action, suspense, a love story, and a female butt kicking character, this is a book for you!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|The need to put the option to play over WiFi for multiplayer. The rating would be five stars if only that option was available
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I would very much like to see Candy Crush Saga the actual game available for my Kindle. I love the game and would like to see an app available.  The imitations you have just don't fill the bill. Come on, how about the real deal? That's why I rated a 1 star.
B005C0DHIK|4.0|I was so angry when I realized what is allowed to happen to people in this country. Nothing is being done to stop this, people are becoming sick, animals are becoming sick, our land is no longer our land. This made me sad.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter wanted this game because a friend had it and I can see why.  Very fun to play and exciting and hard.  My 5 year old son is not able to get the hang of it so I would not recommend it for smaller kids but my 8 year old loves it.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|It is absolutely great for a free app. I definetly recommend this for people who love photography.  I always edit my photos with this.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My daughter asked for this game and I thought it was just some doodle game.  It is fun and a total learning experience.  The levels have scenes and you get clues and have to figure out how to spell and type in the answers and then your answer appears in the scene.  If it's wrong, the game tells you and you can try again.  My 7 and 8 year old love it and my 5 year old was finally interested in spelling.  I'm thrilled to see them loving a game that is teaching them at the same time.  LOVE IT!
B0094M4OW0|5.0|You take this one for what it is and you will enjoy it. Worth what it costs, but then again I saw it for free.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|I got this for my eight year old son and he has watched the movies at last once a week since. Love the collectors box they came in as well.
B00B10DZQE|3.0|Butler's acting was not too good in this movie, the only emotion he showed was harshness.  Could have been done much better since the actual story is interesting.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|bought this with season one for my friend for her birthday... so we are assuming that its as great as season 3... wonderful can't wait for her birthday so we can watch them...
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Much better than the sequel.  Light and entertaining. My children, ages 3-14 enjoyed it.  But skip the sequel, it's not worth your time.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|One of the best shows.............why did they drop it!!!  Definitely one to consider watching again and again.<br />those are my three words
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Really enjoy this series! I like the historical setting.  Also appreciate the solid story line without having to rely on sex to sell it.
0385523394|5.0|This first hand account of this woman's story was awesome. I saw it on Netflix and just couldn't wait for 2014 to find out what happens next.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|At the 1/3 mark the book shifts into high gear.  From then on  it is hard to put down.  Don't read to fast.  Take time to absorb the authors philosophy.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome I only wish it was easier to link with other players none of my friends play it but I know there are lots of people who are also looking for others to play with.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|accessory was sent to the wrong address. I have tried talking to your people 6 times to get this straightened out. They tell me our is fixed but isn't. So no you're service doesn't help me.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game us ridiculously addictive.  However, twice I've had to reload it when I've almost completed all the objectives.  First time was sad - 2nd time is a pattern.  After playing it off & on and the objectives get completed, I get down to the final 2 or 3 and the game won't reload.  I have to delete it from my Kindle HD and reload & I'm up and going - minus all the completed objectives, of course.  Frustration leads to disinterest, otherwise I'd give it a 5.
B00BXVKKPA|5.0|These guys have quickly become a favorite. Hard rock, that sounds super clean. Love the jams on whole album! A mix between ac/dc and skid row.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|Whole family enjoyed this movie!  Action filled, suspenseful, great effects and never a dull moment!  Tom Cruise remains easy on the eyes too!
B000LPI68W|5.0|Introduces Natalie Portman to the movie world and acts as an anchor for coming-of-age assassin movies.  What life experience creates a professional?  Jean Reno is dippy and brilliant at once and captivates while mentoring.  Must see for all movie lovers.
B003G4W49C|4.0|As a really young kid, I read Ender's Game as nearly one of my first real novels. A lot of the concepts and finer details were lost on me, yet I still really enjoyed what I did get. Now, in preparedness for the upcoming film, I returned to the series to rediscover what made me enjoy it so much the first time.<br /><br />Ender's Game is set in a familiar yet well realized vision of the future that places humanity in the middle of a desperate attempt to prepare for another war with a mysterious enemy that already nearly wiped out the entire human race. So desperate that elementary aged kids are placed in extreme rigorous training programs to prepare them for the war.<br /><br />The phenomenal understanding of these characters and how they react to the situations they are placed in is really where the strength of the novel is. Especially of how the reader gets to know many of the characters at a very young age and then seem them grow to overcome daunting challenges later in their lives, similar to what the Harry Potter series did, yet instead of a year per book, Ender's Game covers a much larger amount of time. Which helps show that even though the book is somewhat short, the writing is quick paced and will not linger on one situation with too many details, which helps resemble the feelings of Ender and to an extent some of the other characters, when these kids are getting placed with so much power so quickly because of such a looming threat<br /><br />Ender's game is considered an extremely deep and complex sci-fi experience by many (especially looking at all these glowing reviews), and while I personally didn't find it exceptionally mind-provoking or anything, I did find it to be superbly enjoyable to read and I'm looking forward to diving further into the series.
B0026772N8|4.0|Very cool book.<br />Sparked my desire to see the Pacific Northwest, but not on a motorcycle.  I'd kill myself.  Maybe a in a ragtop Porche 911.<br />Sparked my interest in philosophy.  A little Plato, anyone?<br />Secured my belief in reincarnation.  There are many lives than these.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I just love the MAMMA MIA! movie!  I LOVE MERYL STREEP, and all the cast is superb! The scenery in Greece is just lovely and the music by Abba is just GREAT!  I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who loves the Mamma Mia! movie.  It is a great way to lift your spirits and enjoy all the humor, fun and excitement of a good story. You may want to sing along with some of the songs, and maybe even dance!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love this book, it makes me want to read more and more of Cassandra Clare, I can't wait for her new book!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fast fun addicting<br />Would love longer version.<br />Probably way to hard for you, but if you think you are as good as me, then give it a try.<br /><br />Gavin
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Was explained in great detail but once I left the help guide, forgot everything. Don't know what more I can possibly say. I deleted the game.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|There are so many great sounds on this app that you can't make up your mind which one to play, so I play a different kind each night.  They are so relaxing you can drop off to sleep easily.  My favorite is night sounds.  It reminds me of my younger years while camping.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|This was a skillfully written movie about two characters and their involvement in the Vietnam War like it or not.  Much of the time they do not like what they have to do or witness but life goes on and the job has to be done.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Excellent game.  Excellent graphics, and challenging to play.  Need to practice before you can be good at playing the game.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|From the moment that Josh hit the airwaves I have been intrigued with him and this album just tops it all.  I love all his music but this one had a personal undertone to it.  Its calming exciting and a story all in one.  Brave is the epitome of his writing and it shows how diverse he is.
B001B68XRY|5.0|Very entertaining movie...good story with a good moral. I hope lots of families enjoy this movie. I can teach some kids a good lesson on doing the right thing.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|I had the breaking dawn one already but I saw this and I knew I had to have it the extra 7 plus minutes makes it that much better.  I am so glad that I bought it.
B000NMW6M0|4.0|I was shocked reading the reviews of this movie after watching it, meaning the one-star reviews.  How can you not understand that the movie is about miscommunication/lack of understanding when the title is BABEL?!  Also, please learn that in the majority of cases in movies, the removal of clothes is a physical act representing an emotional desire for intimacy, being known, or, in this case, being understood.  Clearly the Japanese (NOT CHINESE) girl desired affection, intimacy; she desired to be known, understood, HEARD (hence the irony of her being deaf).  The whole theme is about misunderstanding - from the intimate relationship of Brad's and Cate's characters' marriage, to the U.S. misinterpreting the random violence as terrorism.<br />I recommend this movie if you are looking for something deeper, not mere entertainment. But also be warned, many of the events are dramatic to the point of being depressing.
B000002AGB|5.0|The great debate has been The Who Live at Leeds or Isle of Wight. I have to say the Who were more at the top of their game at Wight. A great recoding.
B002C4YYEU|3.0|Born old, live long and die as a baby? Og course it couldn't happen, but it makes for an interesting story,  Life is complicated enough without the challenge of living backwards, seeing your love interests fade while you are becoming younger.  No profound insights on life or deep thoughts, but the film points out that we at least don't hear our Grandfathers Clock ticking backwards to zero instead of going on in a less definite manner.
B009WUAK2M|2.0|I loved the first Expendables. I think this sequel, however, didn't do anything to improve on the original and, in fact, led me to dread the coming of a third.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this movie was the peppering in of old action film legends, not just because they were there -- that is part of the point of these movies after all -- but because of the way they did it. Every old action star had a ridiculous scene or bit of dialog tacked on that pointed to their previous work in some other movie. References to Die Hard, Rambo, Terminator and other such movies were, as I said, tacked on randomly and only served to pull me out of THIS movie. I wanted to see these classic action stars in NEW roles, not be reminded of their old stuff. The first Expendables succeeded in that aspect.<br /><br />Arnold is SERIOUSLY rusty as an actor. His delivery was even more wooden than usual and he seemed to be phoning the whole movie in. Bruce Willis at least tried to take his role as a CIA big-wig seriously. However, this is not what I remembered his character being in the first movie. Maybe I'm remembering wrong.<br /><br />Finally: The one rule of action movies (or any movie for that matter) is that the heroes are responsible for their own fate. You do NOT have a character the audience hasn't seen in 1/2 hour suddenly show up to save the day out of the blue with no reason to be there. This happened at least twice in this movie.<br /><br />PS: Oh, and the action scenes, with the exception of parts of the opening scene, were boring and unimaginative.<br /><br />Total crap. Don't bother with it.
B00DL47ORO|4.0|The documentary takes you back to the 1980,s and the beginning o the Orca's demise. It has various interviews and first person narratives of how orcas actually have displayed aggressive behavior within the confined pools in SeaWorld and other places, like Loro Parque in Tenerife, Spain. There is some bloodshed in the movie, so I would advise caution if you plan on taking your kids. This piece is similar to another movie about similar cetacean, The Cove; in both movies you get pieces of a truth well hidden by those with a fat pocket, unwilling to let go the reins of a multi-billionaire industry. It's just sad.<br /><br />My opinion:<br /><br />Be prepared to view heartbreaking footage. To pillage another being's young, to dislpay it in front of millions of viewers and lie to the public in order to conceal the animals' frustration--leading to fatal, aggressive behavior--is immoral. It's obvious to you as a viewer how much these animals suffer when they are being taken from their pods by looking at the trainer's reaction to the animal's captivity. The saddest part of the movie for me was Tilikum's abduction. An orca's wailing after its young has been taken from its side is heartbreaking.<br /><br />So think about it for one second. You're taken from your parents when you are four years old, stuck in a tank made of concrete, and forced to hang out with strangers from a diversity of cultures you would probably hate (each pod of orcas is so different that it's like comparing  the Homo sapiens, a single species, with thousands of different religions) --this is the road to insanity.<br /><br />It's not only about freeing Tilikum; it's also about stopping the massive hunting of whales and other highly intelligent beings, like dolphins. Cetaceans are having a hard time nowadays. Watch &#34;The Cove&#34; and you'll see what I'm talking about.
B00AJLHUYO|2.0|This movie is one of the most disturbing and strange movies that I have seen in a long time. I actually had a sleepless night after watching this movie.  Ethan Hawke plays an author who unearths a collection of snuff films by a serial killer and what follows is both chilling and disturbing and perhaps the biggest surprise was the ending.<br /><br />An ending that I didn't see coming.<br /><br />Sinister is a disturbing and strange film.<br /><br />I didn't like it.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|it's the best game ever to me and I love for raiting and my favorit game ever.Mi sister's love it to datndey rated dis game tl.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Phantasm is more mystery than horror.  One scene in the movie where Michael is being chased by a sinister dwarf had me laughing when he was running through the cemetary.  Jody, Reggie and Michael are tracked by the mysterious Tall Man.  A sinister ball that slices and dices people and drains the blood right out of you. What's not to like?<br /><br />Phantasm is not as scary as Halloween, Friday the 13th series or the Nightmare on Elm Street series, but still a great mystery.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a awesome game and it has great graphics but during the game it tends to freeze. I think they should really fix it!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is like &#34;retail therapy&#34; without the buyers remorse!!!  I love finding new things, great ideas and just plain anything you want to look up on my Kindle Fire app while waiting at appointments, or relaxing on the front porch sipping a little wine in the evening.  A must have for creative people!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|How did I get through childhood without reading &#34;Little Women?&#34; It should have been a book my mother would have read to me, if she'd had the time. Did I ignore it because I thought it was old fashioned? I can't answer any of those questions. I read it during my daily commute to and from work on the bus, on my Kindle. It enabled me to drown out the sights, sounds and scents so typical of bus-riding, and threw me into the Civil War era and the &#34;impoverished&#34; home of the March family. They thought themselves poor because they had little money, but they were rich in love and support of each other. Some of the narrative may seem &#34;preachy&#34; by today's standards and the morality definitely old fashioned; for me it's a welcome change of pace from today's cynicism and harshness. I'm glad I read it as an adult (and an aged one, at that!).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really action packed app/game for use on the Kindle Fire HD.  The grand kids ranging in age from 7 thru 13 love it because of it's fast pace and skill level.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I loved this movie except for the ending it was really poorly written, I would have liked a better ending. Other than that I thought it was great!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I got this to use at my craft sales for figuring tax percentages.  I highly recommend this as it's so easy to use.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I would love playing uno whenever I was at my uncle's house. Now that I have the same game that me and my uncle play, I can play as long as I want ,whenever I want at home or anywhere else!!!!!!!!!

B004UID2LC|1.0|So I just lost 650 song downloads because of this app I would not get this ever it is like a virus
B001B0G5WA|5.0|Capitol did an A 1 job with this reissue. Not only is the packaging a near perfect match to the original mono from 1966, but it even looks better and pops more. The images are much more clear and bright. The '66 on Capitol inner sleeve is amazing and looks better than an original I own from my mono Revolver by the Beatles. The inner sleeve has more color and more beauty than its original. They also package the 180 gram vinyl in a separate paper/plastic inner sleeve to keep not only the original style inner sleeve looking fresh, but keeping the vinyl itself protected.<br /><br />I have read issues where the B-Side is off center, yet mine is dead center. Must've been that one stamper for that press.<br /><br />On to the sound. The music itself is always superb, but on this press it blows the original mono recording out of the water. It is clearer and is able to show more beauty than that of the muddier original. It even surpasses the mono/stereo digital copies I own. I really recommend this reissue.<br /><br />All in all Capitol did an astounding job in recreating this Wilson masterpiece. The Capitol Vaults reissues are some of the BEST reissues I've EVER seen. The way they make their packaging and vinyl as original as possible is great and on top of that they brush up the recordings to make them sound way better. It is a must buy even if you have a great original mono copy. If you have a Duophonic copy you REALLY need this mono copy.
B009ZABU7S|5.0|The first time i used this app was for my grandma so she could learn English. And it helped, she can fully say a sentence. But  started using it when i travel to place that have another language. And know i speak all types of languages.
B0030MM68O|3.0|The film reflected the mission and the landscape, I guess.  Chaotic, confusing and maddening.  But do we really need to be told once again that war is hell? How about putting some of those energies toward exposing the political hypocrisy that causes them so we can have fewer of them.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great books all three of them plenty of action and even romance it's a pretty intense book but highly recommended
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved the story line and couldn't put it down but my honest opinion would be that it is unbelievable that an 18 yr old boy would speak like that, seemed way too deep to me. Sky seemed right on though and I couldn't put the book down, so for that, I have definitely found a new author I will search more often!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is a lesson in how our emotions can be manipulated - especially by the author!  I enjoyed the writing but found the whole story to be very creepy.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|I have been running on and off for several years, but this is the first time I'm reading book about running. This book with introduce some very interesting thoughts to the readers that we don't expect in a activity that everyone takes for granted.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Worst movie ever.  I got it for free and still feel cheated.  It is just a horrible movie and not worth a minute of your time.
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|This is a horror, COMEDY movie!  We laughed so much we almost wet our pants.  It also has the evil and violence and death but a very different take on the usual Zombie and monster flicks.  Definitely not for young children or those that scare easily.
B0091THDOM|4.0|This item looks so much nicer than it's price, but the elastic on the pull strap broke after maybe three weeks of use, and the design is so snug that you need the pull strap ... so now my nice leather case has an ugly tail.<br /><br />Update: Amazing, surprising customer service! The seller contacted me following the review and offered a replacement, which they sent to me very promptly. It is a great-looking product, and fits well. I'm willing to assume that the replacement will last longer than the original, so I'm upping my original 2 stars to 4 stars. I'm very impressed by this product/seller. Thanks!
B008F9E306|4.0|This is a great album. The production is solid and his lyrics are on point as usual. I am not a huge fan of the guest appearances outside of R.Kelly, but I understand why certain artists were included on this project.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|While written for children, this is a remarkable book that tells a great story with clarity and compassion.  It is a quick and wonderful read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great suspense and good reading.  The will to survive it`s amazing and the courage of each individual is fantastic as well.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Excellent read, love how the stories of each individual character intertwined.  Maps and houses were very helpful in knowing who is who and where they are in relationship to the storyline.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever<br />I loved it so much I loved it I might actually read it again. The only series I will more than once
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Nice movie showing the complex relation between mom and son.<br />The emotions were well handled.Barbara Streisand was awesome.<br />I loved there acting.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I started looking at this movie an stopped because I ws havind a difficult time understanding what the theme was. I hope to look at it some other time in the future. However, the item arrived on time and the quality of the DVD is superb. Visual effects are pristine. Hope to have a better review arter looking at the film.
B00BHMF578|5.0|LOVED IT  not sure why the critics panned this movie.  I normally and not a huge Ben fan, but this was great from the beginning to end!
B00BESM14U|4.0|Sweet, slow unfolding movie. It does seem slow...but it all makes sense in the end. Love the unconditional friendship formation
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|hours of fun packed within this game. If your a fan of the movies you'll be a fan of the game
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|I used this on my Kindle HD.I used it with Foscam cameras it is easy to install. I love it
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's a good app. It's just that my game sometime freezes or slows down. Other than that its fun.I think it has a good twist.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle will always be the no. 1 bookstore in my eyes, no matter what device I am reading it on.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|Unfortunately the Blue Ray is not compatible with my TV but the DVD is and my grand daughter loves it.  Received the package before time and in good order thanks.  I thought when I paid $3.75 for gift wrapping it would be wrapped in birthday paper but instead just got a note I could have typed myself.
B00A2H9L2E|5.0|After seeing the first movie at the theater I wondered if they would do a second part, when this came out all I heard was bad things about it, Thought I would see for myself, not seeing what anyone was finding bad, this film was very good as a sequel to the first, not as good as the first but well worth seeing or if you have the first, picking up . Atmospheric and plenty creepy,,just enough gory bits but not disgusting or cheap., one needs to simply pay attention to pick up where the first one ends and this one starts, once it does it's non stop terror. As an old horror buff I am glad I picked this up ,it's a very good film if you like the Silent Hill movie, Not a video game player I realize it's not the game but as a horror movie it's damn good...
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It is the only app that freezes up and I have to restart my tablet. I had to delete it because I could not play it at all.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|This is without a doubt the best baseball movie of all time ....darn near the greatest movie of all time.... Even after all these years it was just as good as seeing it the first time!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is so much fun. I play it every day. I told a friend about it. He played for like 30 min without stopping. Oh and don't listen to the people who put one star. They must have something wrong with there kindle. Because mine works fine. Did on my friends samsung tab too. Even if it doesn't work on yours it was free, so why be mad.
B003H4I4JU|3.0|Engaging, intriguing, frustrating, and fascinating. The second installment in the Ender series is quite different from the first. In Ender's Game, the reader experiences Ender Wiggins emotional and spiritual journey to prepare himself for the task for which he was chosen. In Speaker for the Dead, we bear the burden of Ender's guilt and grasp untiringly at the hope of Redemption.
B007VDN1PA|3.0|I enjoy using it, it is reliable and it allows me to view and convert film negatives and slides to digital and save them on the computer. It does cost $80 and as far as quality goes I don't think that this device is worth $80, it even has a stick it comes with to guide the negative through the front which is cheap and defective design, and has cheap 2&#34; screen. But I can use it plugged into the wall or to any usb 2.0 decive. Overall: quality and design are unimpressive but it serves its function well and is easy to use, plus its a rare type of equipment that views image negatives and slides which is a unique values all of its own. I am completely satisfied using it but I would like to see it priced maybe $40-$60. It's also cool just to view negatives or slides on its built in screen.
140053271X|3.0|I thought it was a regular nook didnt realize it was so small.. Its okay though for my 8 year old
B003Z49LYO|5.0|At the end of this tragic series I felt so sad for this poor woman and all her trials. My heart ached for her and her struggles. Great series, I loved it.
B00BX8PG5M|4.0|If you like sub movies you will like this.  Good story line and acting in this movie.  I liked it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I wasn't sure how I would get better after Bared to You but it did. Now I can't wait to read Entwined to You.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The only problem is that it makes eBaying too easy.  Searches, bids and payments are a breeze.  I LOVE IT.
0345803485|5.0|Read all three of these books. You can't stop at just one. By the third, it was a little redundant but you want to know how it ends.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|Funny, quotable, twisted, and, most of all, bizarre. The Big Lebowski is the masterwork of the Coen brothers' distinct cinematic quirkiness, and one of my all-time favorite movies. Although, from my own personal experience, it is that sort of film that needs multiple viewings in order for it full ingenuity to shine through.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|This is a very great cult classic and had to have it. It was delivered rather quickly and the quality was very good. A must for any Army of Darkness/Bruce Campbell fan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a perfect way to bust your boredom. It's super fun and addicting. It's even got me and my siblings competing for higher scores. I love this game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The game is adorable for the kids to play! They love it! I would say it is a great and safe game for kids to play.
B008Y73940|4.0|Much better than I expected.  I feared it would be a bit dated.  However, it was very funny, fast paced and had a plot with twists and turns all the way to the end.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I was lucky enough to win an ecopy of this book.  The Husband's Secret is not an edge of your seat thriller.  It quietly sucks you into the lives of these people.  As you are drawn in and you put the book down you continue to think about the story.....and NEED to get back to it to see what happens next!  This is the first novel I've read by this author but I will read more.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I could not finish this book because the writing was so poor. Bad grammar, etc. Too bad, as the story was interesting - i.e. the battle between Edison and Tesla. But I am an editor - something this book really needed1
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I took a chance on and wacthed Doctor Who Season 1 and became addicted to this show. I love it!
B00425S1H8|4.0|Works with both PCs and Macs on both Cisco and Juniper devices with provided RS232/RJ45 cable or dongle. Easy install of driver on MacBookPro.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I have begun this series and it helps me to escape the ho hum of everyday life by living through the excitement of Stephanie Plum.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|A masterfully dramatic depiction of one of the most important eras in history.  You will find it hard to watch less than three episodes each evening!
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|Doing 10.000 steps a day at minimum seemed a lot at first. Especially after finding out that I normally do 4000. After 4 weeks it motivated me to move more, grab the bike over the car and take walks with my wife and kids, instead of hanging in front of the TV. The simple realization got me moving and Withings Pulse helps a lot with this. Having the freedom to move how I want (Bike, Elliptical, walking, running, tennis, etc..), as long as I get 10K a day, turned out to be liberating. Just one month in and all four of us are living a lot healthier then before. So yes, I truly do recommend this product.
B00EE3HVMO|5.0|This is a painful but intelligent drama.  i have only watched the first episode...yet i am hooked.  If you are a mother of a young boy...beware.  You will find yourself in tears.  But i will stick with it.  How often do we find actors and storyline that is so well done, so riveting.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Very sad, but such a good story.  Anyone who has experienced the loyalty of a pet will find this movie heartwarming.  And the people in the town also showed great care for Hachi.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|I was wanting to build a PC primarily for use with Adobe LightRoom5 and Photoshop CS6 with my major goal to upgrade my disk system to SATA-III  Reading the CPU review tables on TomsHardware.com I found that the processor just above this one (A10-5800k), when running PhotoShop, was in the top 6 with the other 5 being Intel's at more than twice the price. Turns out CS6 was optimized to use the on-board GPU.  The A10 was $140 but the A8 was only $90.  Saved that $50 to spend in drives.  The built-in GPU is awsome as well.  I do some gaming, mostly Counter-Strike:Source and this APU turns in 135fps in game whereas my old box barely manager 25fps with a dedicated card.  It may not be the latest or greatest, but it does what I need (And does it well) for not a whole lot of money.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|subway surfers has its ups and downs firstly i think the characters are overpriced and i think you should get more for what your paying for although the game has its downs the good things are its fun its enjoyable and the farther you get the more coins there are i just love the game its just in the store things are overpriced other than that i love this game and i recommend getting it for whoever does not have it i got it on amazon.com

B00DM0XXCM|3.0|I loved the idea of this film and they did a good job of capturing the heart of the concept of two worlds and lovers trying to bridge them.  However, if you are at all scientific, you're going to have a heck of a time suspending disbelief because of how inconsistently the &#34;rules&#34; of this world are applied throughout the film.  This actually pushes the film towards the borderline of fantasy which may be offputting for sci-fi purists.<br /><br />Overall this is fun movie for fans of high-concept sci-fi who are willing to just accept what the movie is willing to give.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|My kids both love to watch this movie -age 2 & 4. Very cute with nothing offensive or bad language. Watched it one time myself and loved it as well- funny adult humor. Would definitely recommend it as a good kids movie!
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Great news app, does everything you want it to. I like the layout, it's easy to use, would've got the full five stars if it wasn't for intermittent crashes which are annoying. I started to use this as a replacement for Google reader, reluctantly at first, but I have come to prefer it and wouldn't go back. Overall a nice little news app.
B002V0929W|5.0|Very interesting and fun to read, I would recommend this book<br />The author did a lot of research and showed us her findings with the classic English Humour
B000069HJN|5.0|I have been a huge Supertramp fan since about 1975, and when this came out I HATED it. I may have, in a fit of blind rage, even burned the cassette! For some bizarre reason I purchased this remastered CD on a whim and decided to give it another chance, alone from the first song to the last, on headphones. And I was quite shocked at how much I enjoyed it! Really, after many further listens it has now joined the ranks of the Mighty Four (Crime, Crisis, Quietist and Breakfast). Supertramp fans and, more specifically Roger Hodgson fans, please give this another chance.
0064471837|5.0|I've always been a fan of fantasy novels, and when I discovered 'Sabriel' I knew I'd found something very special. Nix's writing style draws you into his richly-developed Old Kingdom/Ancelstierre worlds, and unlike quite a few other fantasy novels, the story is very original. Being a bellringer myself, I was instantly drawn to the idea of using handbells to control the Dead, and the ways that Nix's types of magic work are far more sophisticated and realistic than I expected. Also, the storyline is not in any way generic and boring - there is a very strong heroine, properly sinister villains that actually need a decent amount of effort to get rid of, and - personally my favourite bit - the sarcastic cat-shaped creature Mogget is arguably one of the best characters I have encountered in fantasy literature.<br /><br />Years after buying this book and the others in the trilogy, they remain my favourite series and I seriously cannot recommend them highly enough!
B00A285OOW|3.0|This would have been a better review if I didn't have the sour taste in my mouth after realizing 10% of the book was an excerpt from The White Queen, which I've already read. Boo!<br />I also found a few grammatical/spelling errors, leading me to believe this was hastily turned out for book sales.<br /><br />Not her best work. No one likable, which isn't her fault, but sure didn't help. Also it should at least have included prince Arthur's death.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book makes you truly think about how you have lived your life and what is truly Important. I would recommend that every one read this book at some point.
B005EIS5IW|5.0|Yeah is you get every single comic in this book you might be a crazy cat person. And I wave my crazy cat lady flag proudly. Its a must read for anyone who is a cat employee, 'cause there is no such thing as a cat owner.

B008JFUR10|5.0|I loved this movie so much! It has been a very long time since I was this jazzed about a movie. Guillermo Del Toro is just a master of visuals. The jaegers and kaijus were just stunning and made Transformers look like a bad college Visual Aid project gone wrong. And being a lady a shirtless Charlie Hunnam definitely is perfect eye candy for any girlfriends or wives who were dragged along to enjoy.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Really enjoyed this story, found it to be entertaining and had a good interesting plot and twists . I recommend this book, and I'm going  to order Dan Browns next book Inferno
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This isn't a mob movie like those that have come before, and don't be fooled by the polish of the poster.  This film is polished alright, but it's gritty and gruesome, too.  It's an old fashioned black hats vs. white hats, but the white hats get dirty.  The characters are compelling, and only say as much as they need to - so listen up.  The action rolls fast and builds momentum so that the suspense is tight up to the very satisfying end.  Real romance, violence that's better left seen than read about, and characters you can believe in even if you don't want to.  Oh, and it's based on a true story.  ...Are you watching it yet?<br /><br />*If I could criticize anything, it would be minor, so only pay as much heed to this as you would a gossip rag:  I just wish that Ryan could have gotten that lighter snap down a little smoother, like a bad habit instead of a nervous twitch - or maybe he meant it that way.  And Emma, gorgeous and grounded, just needed to float a little lighter and sway a little savvier in her heels and silk gowns.  Otherwise, both are excellent, as are the rest of the cast.
B003QS9WIE|5.0|Beautifully written and acted by two amazing actors. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make a compatible protagonist And and antagonist. And David Bowie as Nichola Tesla, brilliant!

B008JGSM6G|3.0|app works perfectly, it's just a bit repetitive. got it for free so I will not complain. thanks amazon for the free app!
B003G4W49C|4.0|In this book Ender Wiggin is taken from home at six years old. He's taken to battle school where he will learn to fight the infamous buggers. I mostly like that this book shows all of his struggles and how everyone is beating him down to make him a commander. I would mostly recommend this book for like +13 because a lot of concepts in this book would be hard for younger kids to understand.

B0002VFXFE|3.0|It is hard to give the fair evaluation of this product because I ordered it on July 2 and did not receive it until August 5, by that time I used a different product. This is by far the longest time  for me to receive any shipment from Amazon.com and I'm sure it's the fault of our United States Post Office which is showing signs of distress.

B00D67DI9O|5.0|Without being as dark or goth as \\"Feel It Break\\", \\"Olympia\\" is a layered success of melody and texture. It is brighter and more accessible than the brooding and overlapping moments of Austra's debut and maintains its hallmark style of operatic vocals and harmonies.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|I didn't realize this was the alternative movie ending....I would like the original...but the story is still a good one
B0019N95IK|5.0|Enterprise could have been the ST franchise's most interesting series too bad Rick Berman & company failed to capitalized on it. The Vulcans should have been included right from the get go instead of the temporal cold war and the boring Zenis aliens. The 4th season is of course the high light of the series by then it was too little too late and Berman completely ruined the series finale(every Trekies know what I am referring to). I still give it 5 stars the blue ray discs are sharp and clear even the cgi are quite good.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book....I have a copy for my kids...and I got a copy and gave to my mom.  It's about a mom who take care of her son and when she gets older he takes care of her...it's very sweet.

B008JFUN6E|3.0|In 2009, director Neill Blomkamp made his feature debut with the sci-fi drama, District 9 - about the segregation of aliens in a South American internment camp, called District 9.  This film was shot on a relatively conservative budget of $30 million and went on to gross more than $200 million worldwide.  Not only did the film perform well at the box office, but it was also highly praised by fans and critics, and even went on to earn four Academy Award nominations - including a nomination for Best Picture.  The overwhelming success of District 9 has obviously set an elevated bar for Neill Blomkamp and his next film.  In his second endeavor, Blomkamp once again returns to the world of sci-fi, re-teaming with his former District 9 star, Sharlto Copley, and adding Matt Damon in the politically and sociologically driven film, Elysium.<br /><br />Written and directed by Neill Blomkamp (District 9), Elysium stars Matt Damon as Max, a former car thief turned factory worker.  After an accident at work, Max is exposed to a high dose of radiation, giving him only five days left to live.  He turns to a powerful underground associate, called Spider (Wagner Moura), to help him get to the off-earth space station, Elysium.  The home to the richest members of earth's desolate society, Elysium also houses the technology to heal the sick and dying.  However, before Spider will send Max to Elysium, he must first kidnap a wealthy member of society and extract vital, profitable information.  Unfortunately, things don't always work out as planned for Max.  Jodie Foster, Alice Braga, William Fichtner, and Sharlto Copley also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />With so many different incarnations of sci-fi and desolate futures, it can be taxing to stay original.  The story of Elysium is certainly an interesting story, full of innuendos about wealth vs. poverty, but more importantly - the film doesn't feel like other sci-fi films.  Sure, it throws in elements of Total Recall, Gattaca, and even Terminator, but Elysium doesn't feel like a knock-off, rip-off flick that a studio or filmmaker made just for the sake of making a movie.  However, as soon as Matt Damon dawns this exoskeleton suit, it's hard not to think about Robocop - or even a variation of Darth Vader.  The weaponry, which fire like normal weapons, suddenly morph into devastatingly catastrophic weapons.  Shades of Judge Dredd, perhaps?  And, what's with Sharlto Copley's character having some random impenetrable shielding device?  For a film that feels like a down-to-earth sci-fi story, it doesn't take long for it to incorporate elements that severely feel out of place.<br /><br />Matt Damon is one of the most talented actors in Hollywood, so it shouldn't be a surprise to hear that he brings his A-game to Elysium.  While he did train intensively for this role - not to mention shave his head, his character can be a bit clunky at times.  There's little doubt that his character, Max, is meant to do something special with his life, but at the same time, Max is a desperate and tragic character.  He realizes early on in the film that he wants to live, although he never really shows what it is he wants to live for - other than himself.  He connects briefly with his childhood friend, Fray (Alice Braga), but feels little remorse for her daughter's detrimental health.  And, it is pretty outlandish that he takes such physical punishment without consequence over the course of the film - having his arm broke, being stabbed, going through major constructive surgery, and receiving a full dose of radiation.  It is pretty astonishing that this character can go from the fetal position one minute to someone that's stronger than everyone else the next.  Still, Damon looks pretty awesome with his Hitman-look and tailor made suit, so much so that he (at times) completely overshadows the film, which really isn't what Neill Blomkamp was hoping for with this flick.<br /><br />Visually speaking, Elysium looks very similar to District 9, making it extremely plausible that both films could take place in the same film universe.  Both films take place in rundown, destitute societies - with the main difference being one is an alien quarantine, while in Elysium, the story's main city of Los Angeles is filled with poor, sick people that are struggling for survival.  It's essentially the same premise, only each film takes place on the other side of the planet.  Aside from the locations, the film relies on CGI, but not enough to make it look abusive or unnecessary.  Anytime off world interaction takes place, odds are CGI will come into play, and although the CGI isn't the best, the concept of the Elysium station and the spaceships are still visually engaging enough to sell the story as a serious sci-fi drama.  On a side note, it's actually nice to see some space travel that doesn't involve massive Star Trek-looking spaceships, filled with warm speed and unavoidable alien encounters.<br /><br />Overall, Elysium is a solid story, but it's not on par with District 9.  Matt Damon is a relatively major draw in the film industry, so he might be enough to put butts in seats.  However, the film is far from an enjoyable thrill ride, featuring strange characters (mostly the villains), and flawed messages of political corruption and the implication that rich people are evil.  Despite its flaws, Elysium is still an enjoyable film, all-be-it clich&eacute;d and troublesome at times with its character development.  Sadly, Jodie Foster presence in the film is hardly worth mentioning and her skillset is basically wasted, only sharing one brief scene with Damon.  In any event, Matt Damon offsets the obvious flaws, making this film a recommendable feature - only if you're into cataclysmic future action stories, though (and who isn't?).  There's very little doubt that this film definitely caters to those of us that have an acquired taste for sci-fi chaos.<br /><br />GRADE:  C<br />FNDNreview.commilar to District 9, making it extremely plausible that both films could take place in the same film universe.

1781162646|5.0|Stephen king is in classic form with JOYLAND! I admit I am partial to his writing style and he does miss the mark for me at times. The characters' backgrounds are fully developed and believable and the pace is brisk. Only in paperback but it is the type of story that lends itself to this type of medium. A must read for any fan.
0425263924|2.0|I loved the first 2 books. Could not wait for the last one. Pre-ordered the 3rd of the trilogy (which is not a trilogy after all) I started to read entwined with you and was so confused because I read it so long ago that I couldn't remember how the last book ended. And I don't think she did a good job of recapping. Had to re-read the last few chapters of reflected in you (which I did with pleasure because I loved it so much). Then back to this book..... Disappointed.... More storylines opened up and not enough answers. Never thought I would say this but I would've preferred less sex and more answers. I get it, Gideon is good in bed but seriously it's all they do. 2 successful people with so many problems shouldn't have all this time on their hands. Lol I am not a prude (loved the whole 50 shades thing) but I actually cringed a few times. Yes, I will read the next book because I need to know what happens but will not be too upset about waiting to get it from the library. Free!

B000AYEL6U|5.0|North & South proves once again that BBC is the master of period dramas, and quality TV for an intellectual audience. Their programs remain consistently good, their casts do not succumb to the A-list Tendency, which is to cast actors for their name and fame only. Their production values remain very high, no matter the budget, and they consistently choose good subjects.<br /><br />Let us first speak of the acting. Richard Armitage is absolutely electrifying in his role as John Thornton, the stern and brooding mill owner who may seem cold on the outside, but is revealed to be an good and honourable man inside. His performance is absolutely phenomenal! Armitage, actually, is always phenomenal, and brings to his role charisma, gravitas, drama, and his piercing gaze and excellent voice. I recommend seeking out his excellent roles as [[ASIN:B008U504JE John Porter]] and [[ASIN:B00BWJARHO Thorin Oakenshield]]. His presence on the screen is noticeable, and helps carry the miniseries by lending it his dramatic weight.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is brilliant, too. Daniela Denby-Ashe plays a pretty-faced but complex Margaret Hale, a worthy counterpoint to Armitage, Tim Pigott-Smith is typically excellent as her bookish father, and Brendan Coyle ([[ASIN:B00AXVHHTI Downton Abbey]]) steals the scenes as the leader of the uprising worker's unions. Sinead Cusack, wife of Jeremy Irons, plays in a strong performance as Thornton's mother. This show of excellence does not stop at the leads, but carries down even to the minor characters and extras. BBC, I tell you, is unrivalled in excellence.<br /><br />The production values, set design, and costumes are rich and realistic. The air is smokey and grey, the streets dark and muddy, the costumes rich, period-accurate, and lived-in. The sets feel real, mostly because they ARE, - lit by candles and smokey gas lamps, the wallpapers fading and the chairs perhaps a little scuffed. This is not the shiny, almost story-bookish unreality that plagues so many soap operas. The result is an engrossing and involving adaptation.<br /><br />The story does not disappoint, an effective mystery of romance, drama, character study, and political pronouncement on worker's leagues and fairness of rank. Gaskell's work is not as comedic as Austen's, nor as classic as Dicken's, but is still excellent, and a must-read for fans of the miniseries, or any of the aforementioned authours.<br /><br />I highly recommend North & South as both an engrossing character study and drama, and a showcase for some of the BBC's finest acting (courtesy of Richard Armitage and Co.) and excellent production values. Five stars!<br /><br />Also recommended, some of my favourite BBC classic dramas:<br />[[ASIN:B0083IJWNC Pride and Prejudice]] - the undisputed lord of all costume dramas, Pride and Prejudice, starring Colin Firth as Darcy.

B00470TOV0|5.0|This is a stellar movie. The storyline is much stronger than I honestly expected. I'd always had this figured for a simple action movie, but was not disappointed to find out I was wrong. Not so sure about the  historical accuracy, but I do like the costuming. Commodus' white armor at the end of the film is quite impressive.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I saw the movie first and wasn't sure if I wanted to spend time reading the book too. But I am glad I did! It's a quick read but well written, funny and sad at the same time with a twist that in the story that is different than the movie so read the book to find out what you missed in the movie.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|The unit has difficulty connecting to wireless networks. Use is limited until they get more applications on board. No app yet to support the unit. Hold off until 2014 or so. I think they'll get it right eventually.
B009CG9CXO|5.0|One of the greatest movies of all time.  But I didn't see any deleted scenes.  I bought the digital copy for my cloud library.  Maybe it comes on the physical DVD?  I don't know - but I did not see any extra scenes - or have a choice to.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Never a dull moment! Loved the characters, the plot, and all the twists and turns. Can't wait to continue the series.
B003FFEX8C|5.0|One of my favorite &#34;super hero&#34; movies.  Good story, great animation, a little comic relief - and Halle Berry KICKS ASS!!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|This series got better each consecutive season, but 3 had one of the best double episodes ever: The Best of Both Worlds.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like BBC and this app works just right to check it while on the move with my Kindle Fire HD.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Before downloading this app, I had the email on my smartphone that you created... and it was so annoying because you couldn't click on the &#34;links&#34;.  This app makes checking my email on my Kindle like checking it on my laptop.  I love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is better then  temple run 1 &amp; 2  . Also it test when and how you react it is very challenging and hard to understand and fight out when something will happen and also I love  the minions they are so cute!!!
B004VMUS9G|1.0|I tried this app and didn't like it because I was confused as to how to work with it.  It just annoyed me and I actually forgot to delete the app, come to think of it!
034580404X|5.0|This was a fantastic read. Could not put the book down. Would I read EL James in the future? Oh YES YES YES ......
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Although I have not had the chance to play this game on my device, I loved it when playing it on my friend's phone.  I'm sure it's just as fun or moreso, seeing as the Kindle Fire has a bigger screen than a smartphone.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|Worth reading but it is not of the same caliber I normally associate with Jeffrey Archer. A good, but not great book.
B001ANYDAO|2.0|I thought this would be an uplifting account of successful people but its actually a book about how all successful people are successful because they're lucky
0982954328|5.0|What a mysterious quagmire, sinister and poetical at the same time. It's been years since I read a Sherlock Holmes book, and it was in Russian on top of it. Reading it in English again brought me back to the moor, to the fog, to the melancholy English countryside where a vicious criminal plotted a cold-blooded murder by means of evoking an old family legend and making it come to life. Arthur Conan Doyle unfolds it masterfully, without missing a single detail and dragging the reader deeper and deeper into a tangle of secrets, at the same time narrating in a relaxed conversational of a gentleman simply telling a story. And the story is worth telling.<br /><br />Famous detective Sherlock Holmes is presented with a curious incident of old Sir Charles Baskerville dying tragically and unexpectedly, with no obvious signs of struggle, presumably, of a heart attack, leaving behind a considerable estate. Was it an accident? How did he really die? What if the legend is true? What if the hellhound, that supposedly is the Baskervilles' family curse and cause of death of every Baskerville, exists? Dr. Mortimer, a family friend, relays this story to Holmes and Watson, concerned for the well being of Sir Henry Baskerville, a new heir who is about to arrive from Canada to inherit the estate. And here the wild ride begins. What starts out as a simple string of coincidences and seemingly trivial and unrelated facts quickly escalates into a chilling chase, first in London, then at Baskerville Hall, and then comes to a spectacular and horrific climax out on a desolate Devonshire moor, complete with hellish howls in the boggy mist, savage prison convicts, strange tightlipped butlers, beautiful secretive women, and a slew of logical puzzles that are so characteristic of Doyle's work. I might just start rereading all Sherlock Holmes books again, this one was so good.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This book was a thought provoking riveting read. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others. Once I started I couldn't put it down
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Made it through the entire series in less than a week. It's like a good book that you just can't put down. The story line is good and i'm enjoying the characters. Found myself chuckling out loud at some of the comments made by the actors. Entertaining, Can't wait to stream the next season.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I really enjoy the information but, was disappointed that I could not watch the dvds as they stopped part way through the episodes.  Someone should have checked to ensure that there was nothing wrong with the disks.
B00BNXOMHA|4.0|Bought this as a gift and she's diggin' em! I heard this is good stuff but I myself haven't got into them.
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|I bought the game and love it. It's fun and clever without being overly-complicated and or too difficult.<br />However I cant progress to Chapter 5-2 (Sword of Power) on my Kindle Fire (gen 1) as the game shuts down unexpectedly when I try to play. It also did so on the final stage in chapter 4 but I spammed the tick to by pass it.<br />please solve problem so I can give the game 5 stars!<br /><br />Update:<br />Problem fixed and finished the game. Great all around play and worth every penny, if a bit short. Hope to see more from the 5 Ants and Rovio Stars crews
B004NOH9LC|4.0|This is a fun lighthearted movie, one that can easily be watched while doing other things. Definitely going into my \\"sewing movie\\" pile.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We are thoroughly hooked on this show.  We watch one or two an evening.  Love it,  We will continue to watch through the available seasons.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Good show, but some episodes wasn't worth watching. However, it does get your emotions going, it makes you upset by some of the stupid mistakes that they make. Season four should be a good one.
B007DIQC90|5.0|I heard Little Talks on the radio. The music is beautiful. I live in a small town and Amazon is the only place I found the music I like.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It's much nicer to watch this on amazon than trying to catch it on tv.  It also beats trying to flip through multiple DVR recordings
B008J344BQ|5.0|I bought this because I heard the song Just Give Me A Reason on the radio and liked it. After listening to the CD I love all the songs
034580709X|5.0|I think I have read all the Harry Hole books. This is supposedly the first and maybe the best of all
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I had never heard of Nate until he sang with Pink. I listened to the free preview and liked it. It is one of my favorites.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I cannot bear to miss an episode. The actors chosen to<br />portray Holmes and Watson are perfect. I especially enjoyed the way Sherlock got his trademark hat.  I also loved him arriving at Buckingham palace in a sheet.  Sorry, 2nd season :)
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Kept my attention but the story line was not as good as the first movie. It is still worth seeing.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I really like getting to fix the peoples hair.  Even though it is overpriced I still think that it is a wonderful and  entertaining game.
B001EBV0IA|5.0|eastwood is a great filmmaker who here reinvents a timeworn genre [the western] and creates a classic story..shades of the searchers here and john ford...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We loved the entire series.  It's refreshing to watch something that wasn't targeted at sixth graders.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|another great series from the brits...this one an intriguing character study and mystery.  kept me on the edge of my seat for the 1st few episodes.  remains to be seen how long this plot can be sustained...
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Get this as a replacement for the stock charger that comes with the Kindle.  All my power charging problems were solved.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|great characters and sublime plot twists fill this drama and study of the classes...the series meanders along like british life in the countryside, all its missing is a cameo by sir anthony hopkins
B008TRH5N6|1.0|Complete rot. Any childs fairy tale has more truth and inspiration than this worthless tale.<br />Citing a charleton like Hereward Carrington is more evidence that this author does not even have the<br />imagination to fabricate his own stories.<br />Elwin Bagley
B001A4LYN2|5.0|every several months or so i pull this out and sink into the grim moodiness and excellent character study of mr. plain view.  johnny greenwood's [of radiohead fame] score is chillingly perfect
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I use this app to read library books and once I figured out how to maneuver around the screens and access and operate &#34;manage my kindle&#34;  it's easy and practical.
B007HACDLK|5.0|People keep dying and the protagonist cannot communicate with his organization.  He figures out and foils each of his assassins toward a crescendo climax.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|After hearing about the PBS special from a friend and starting the diet based on what they told me, I decided to pick up the book to round out my understanding.  I have never dieted and never considered doing so but its such an easy concept it was easy and perfect for me.<br />Think fasting will be difficult? Try it and you will surprised.
1439156816|5.0|King's book is an excellent description of what it means to be a writer. King himself is a good writer, using correct grammar for the most part. Personally, what he writes about verb tenses and usage made my heart leap.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook is an ok app. It has potential and can be much better. It is a collaborative information system that can be a great marketing tool, educational interface and business enabler.
B0071BY1ZQ|5.0|Personnel:<br /><br />Brad Mehldau - Piano<br />Larry Grenadier - Bass<br />Jeff Ballard - Drums<br /><br />I own almost every record of Mehldau's and this easily ranks among, if not the, very best. With his Trio the music here is consistently full of surprises and kinetic interplay. A collection of all original music, every song feels distinctly written for this group. What makes this recording stand out even among Mehldau's other work is the elevated performances of his peers; Grenadier's always fantastic sound is extremely well-recorded here and Ballard's playing is particularly driving and responsive. A must have.<br /><br />Highlights -<br /><br />Dream Sketch<br />Kurt Vibe<br />Aquman<br />Days Of Dilbert Delaney
B00B6CQIO8|5.0|DVD's arrived and work great!  Already watched all three seasons and I'm excited for Season 4 ! Yes, I would recommend this!
B00BUKODDO|4.0|Personnel:<br /><br />Gary Burton - Vibraphone<br />Julian Lage - Guitar<br />Scott Colley - Bass<br />Antonio Sanchez - Drums<br /><br />Another great Burton release, this quartet outing is full of great group dynamics and high energy levels. If you are familiar with their last CD \\"Common Ground\\" this record is very similar in approach and sound (recorded in the same NYC Studio). Most of the tunes are medium tempo grooves with intricate melodies and strong solo playing. Colley and Sanchez have an excellent rapport and provide strong support, perhaps somewhat heavy handed, throughout. Lage and Burton have been playing together since Lage was 12 years old and the connection they have developed is strong and clear. Recommended.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Agree or disagree, this is an amazing read and well deserving of its long run on the best-seller list.  I read it on Kindle but was delighted to have received a hard copy as a gift so I can more easily re-read parts of it.  Have read of some NDE's but this book goes way beyond that.  I fall into the &#34;utterly believable column&#34; but this is a good pick for book club discussions, although they might get a bit heated--subject will be a touchy one for some.
B006M4F67A|5.0|I loved it and I will play it over and over  keep them coming  I want more  more more lol
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Have found myself wondering about the weather in Chirk, Wales; or in Oporto, Portugal.  For 18 months I could check the weather anywhere, but one day I got the cleaning bug and deleted a lot of apps on my Kindle.  Well, here I am a few weeks later putting it back on.  It is a good and handy app to have.
B009AP2G26|5.0|excellent.  I like the new york sub plot.  I like some of the new characters in the high school.  don't care for a few of them. the chemistry is weak between some of them. liked the school shooting show.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|My wife and I started watching it and are really enjoying it. Just started season two. Took us a week to view the episodes from season one and helps fill the gap left while Downton isn't on. Really getting to know the characters more and really enjoy the setting and morals of the show.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played. It is very addicting and I try to play it every time I get a chance.
B008J05EL8|1.0|STOP!  Don't go there!  This is an absolute rip-off.  It won't even install, let alone open.  I hope I can get my money back.  YOU have been warned, repeatedly, judging from all the other reviews.  I was STUPID, and thought I might be able to work around the errors.  WRONG ANSWER!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the simple easiness of playing this game ..it's relaxing and very enjoyable.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys solitaire.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really do not know where to start. I had never heard of the show until a friend mentioned it so I watched the pilot...  I was hooked after that and watched both seasons over the next two weeks thanx to Amazon Prime. I am now hooked and about to start the new season.
B009APMNB0|5.0|I love that it can do dual monitors. Such ease to use.<br />I can see a great difference in the monitor settings.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Excellent Production and Costumes. Some of the heroes can be a bit boring, but the villains are excellent and you almost feel for them.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love this app so much! Mostly because I love puzzle games and I like to put pieces of the puzzle together to form the final product. It's great!
B000QCSA54|4.0|I liked the book...it's concise and straight to the point. Just wish there was more to it than stating the obvious.

0064471837|5.0|I first read Sabriel a long time ago. Middle school, I think. Since then I've read it (and the rest of the Abhorsen trilogy) several times over, an honor reserved to only one other book series.<br /><br />Nix has a talent for creating captivating, brilliant, and (importantly) creative/original fantasy worlds and concepts. His books drop you into the middle of a world and let you linger for a while, but you know that the world has existed long before your visit and will continue afterwards.<br /><br />To me, it's really the world of the Abhorsen trilogy that sets it apart, moreso than the actual story. The world of Charter magic and and Necromantic bells is one that really tickles my imagination. I find myself yearning for more backstory - an equivalent of Tolkein's Silmarillion if you will.<br /><br />I could go on about the characters, the fascinating contrast between the magical Old Kingdom and the \\"modern day\\" Ancelstierre, or the plot itself, but I think other reviewers have done that plenty.<br /><br />What I love most about the book is its introduction to Nix's world, and I can't wait to visit again.
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love this series.  I love that so many secondary characters are more than one-dimensional.  I like that every major character is multi-faceted and no one is purely good or evil.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Loved the story line of this movie,not a dull moment while watching.<br />I usually get bored with movies at some point, but not this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the best book of the hunger games series I have read so far! I love the surprise ending and I can't wait to read the next one!!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up, simple to use, and it looks great when I have it take over the video from my tablet. I often see my kids huddled around a tablet watching things. No more of that. At the cost Google is selling it I can't see why anyone wouldn't buy one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've been told its like a soap opera but I hate soap operas. The acting is wonderful and it is a lovely period piece.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|What can I say? My family and I love the show and enjoy watching episodes again and again. Worth every penny!!
B000HSKUBE|5.0|I was happy to see original version of US show.  Great characters and spell binding action.  I like yhe actors.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I liked BD just fine.  It definitely is a unique story in the YA college freshman romance space!  I wish Travis and Abby had tapped into the college's counseling services -- they need to be healthy, trusting and secure apart and together.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I tried several times to get game to work but it won't even load onto kindle properly.  Very disappointing as this looked like a fun game.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I just started watching this show a few months ago. Got this so I could get caught up when season 9 starts in Oct. This is the best show I've seen in a very long time. I can't get enough of it.  Jenson and Jared are great actors.
B00BGIC2J2|4.0|If you are the right audience (40ish, in the mood for mindless fun) you will laugh out loud.  Not for the PG crowd.  Open a bottle of wine and enjoy!
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I love everything about this movie! Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper were fantastic! I would definitely recommend this movie. It's a really good movie
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|This book is the best book ever! I think that everyone should read this amazing piece of literature! It's most wonderful book ever!
B006VZS1EA|2.0|The movie has somewhat of a Rocky theme, expected loser comes to show their power.<br />This viewer was surprised, maybe I wasn't expecting a movie made for 12 yr olds. However I must admit the acting wasn't too bad & the characters were under somewhat original theme.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Even though I haven't read the book I enjoyed the movie... The surprise twist reminded me of the movie The sixth sense... Left me happy to wonder about the character's futures!  Always like stories about people able to find a home!
B003G4W49C|2.0|No need to go into details - this is a work that has been hashed over infinitely in the sci-fi fandom. Just put me down as one of those who dislike its genocidal plot, creepy self-congratulating tone, and semi-reluctant semi-fascism.<br /><br />[MINOR SPOILERS THAT EVERYONE ALREADY KNOWS, BELOW]<br /><br />The main character is every sci-fi nerd's personal fantasy - the kid who got picked on because he's just too darned smart for everyone else. That he goes on to save the world is just more typical fantasy, standard for this type of fiction. But that in doing so he beats two of his tormentors to death, then destroys an entire alien solar system and its resident species, but somehow bears no responsibility for any of this, is a truly psychotic manifestation of that fantasy that seeks to grant itself absolution for its own violent content. Card here is simply letting his id run wild, then trying to throw a blanket over it so we don't see what he's really like inside.<br /><br />The supposed moral tone of the book is a sham - again simply Card trying to evade responsibility for his own ideology. That the proctors \\"feel bad\\" about torturing a child beyond endurance for military purposes in no way mitigates the reality of what they're doing, but Card plays this trivial humanizing trick to get them, too, off the hook. The absurd climax - genocide by whimsical accident - is another moral trivialization. The one great moral statement of the book - Ender taking on the role of protector of his own victims - shows some depth, but no one ever addresses the basic question whether it was right for anyone to have done anything they did, so his penance is simply the product of his tortured juvenile mind, and carries little true moral weight.<br /><br />The basic story is awkward and poorly paced. The vast majority of it has to do with training in the Battle Room, but that is only a preliminary to the main plot point. The psychic fantasy video game thing is just weird. The military tactics Ender teaches himself in the wargames are too superficial to hold up the story of the great battle at the end, but the real battle takes only a few pages. The three siblings are absurd fantasy figures: the most brilliant individuals in the human race, one too mean, one too nice, one just right, but all of them capable of commanding armies and governments by the sheer force of their minds, before puberty. Again, not real literature, just the lonely bookish nerd's revenge fantasy expanded to epic length.<br /><br />This is an engaging but fundamentally ugly book, written for juveniles at a juvenile level. It is incomprehensible how it attained status as a classic, and worrisome that it is taken so seriously by so many. It is basically \\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" written by and for the kind of people who pull the wings off flies, then lie about it.tactics Ender teaches himself in the wargames are too superficial to hold up the story of the great battle at the end, but the real battle takes only a few pages.

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Wonder zoo is a pretty entertaining game. U can save the  zoo and also rescue some dinosaurs. The only thing I can't stand about every game including this one is u have to wait to do everything. U have to use peanuts to spread up time in this game. So other than the time problems this game is a-okay......
B00DM0UTPQ|3.0|Good story. Great actors. Bad direction. Those actors are capable of much more than this film depicted. The story was choppy and disjointed.  Those are both shortcomings of the director's poor vision.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|The cast in Red really make it what it is.<br />The plot is one we've seen before however the combination of<br />wit and slapstick humor (especially around John Malkovich) is wonderful!<br /><br />There are a few surprises that make this easy to sit through to the end<br />and the chemistry between the actors makes for a rare feel good action flick!
B00CTEP7O4|4.0|Very enticing show much like house md but with lawyers instead of doctors.  It only gets better as it goes.
B00ECU34ZM|2.0|This movie had very little character development, poor visual effects, and a generally shallow plot.  Would not recommend to anyone.  Just go watch Elysium in the theatre instead.

B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I enjoyed this did it on easy and it was fun! Game is a little easier than some but I found it enjoyable to not be so intense about a game. It has harder modes that I haven't tried but I liked the way it let you know if number was in wrong spot was just a lot easier way of playing which was stress free!! I say give it a try!!

0321704452|5.0|I had been told about Garr Reynolds before I watched one of his presentations on video. As a matter of fact, his presentation really kindled my interest in his books. I therefore took a general look of three of his books and found out the present one was the most attractive. Reynolds is an excellent presenter and I really appreciated his \\"naked\\" style. I have watched presentations during my professional life and many of them are boring for the reasons Reynolds mentioned in the above book. The Naked Presenter was therefore an eye-opener to me and I do recommend it. The author made reference to Steve Jobs' convincing presentation style in the book, both Jobs and Reynolds being inspired by oriental values of simpilicity and engagement.<br /><br />In my view, the above book is among the best ones in its area of interest and a must for every presenter.

Even some of the stories don't apply to me yet it was still a hilarious and honest read.  I'm sure I'll read it again.  We need more books like this out there!
030771652X|4.0|Very gripping story. Book in very good condition. Delivery in good time. Rosamund Lupton had a unique style of writing as if writing a letter to her dead Sister.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|To be clear, I am not a fan of the recent zombie trend and pervasive nature of zombies in entertainment media(movies/video games)<br /><br />I adore this film.<br /><br />In my honest opinion(IMHO) this is a great zombie film, a great comedy.<br /><br />IMHO this is the best \\"bromance\\"/ buddy comedy film in my collection(250+ movies)<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film yet, please do.<br /><br />\\"Shaun of the Dead\\"<br />Arguably, the best Horror/Comedy out there and also one of my favorite Zombie movies. (NOTDOT #1)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00C6BACF4 Shaun Steelbook Blu ray Digital UltraViolet]]<br /><br />Also arguably, \\"the film that \\"started it all\\".<br /><br />I highly recommend viewing this film, a personal favorite.

B0067RQYNW|1.0|Not nearly as adaptive as it claims to be, nor as user friendly. A lot of trouble to work this software, especially the spreadsheet. I guess it would be worth the download if you don't won't to pay for an Office product.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just started this game and figuring it out, but nice game so far. I am leaving a review so I can receive extra diamonds in game.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great game to keep your mind sharp and help you stay focused. Also, helps you to see the big picture. Would recommend to anyone who likes to keep their wits sharp.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This is a great read and I'd recommend it for anyone that likes fantasy. You will be totally addicted once you start!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of the best series I have viewed. I would place it right up there with Mad Men...which is great.
B001MSMUH0|3.0|If, like me, you were thunderstruck by Sir Ken Robinson's TED talk (&#34;Your daughter's not sick; she's a dancer&#34;) then you already believe that our current education system--as he says--does a pretty ruthless job of destroying creativity. This book is a detailed exploration of the notions from that first TED talk.<br /><br />The stories are poignant. If you don't believe education has to be more human centered, this book will convince you. But that's the problem.<br /><br />If you're looking for the next steps--perhaps a way to help a child or loved one find what Joseph Campbell called &#34;your bliss&#34; then go for the sequel to this book. This book is an extended justification. Perhaps the saddest commentary is that we need to justify a return to more human-centered teaching, and Robinson does his usual wonderful job of describing with humor and insight--its a fun read--but if you're looking for an action guide, go for the sequel.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just received my Chromecast, purchased directly from Google, yesterday.  Here are a few things I've noted:<br /><br />-Packaging...it's a very slick box that comes with the necessary components.  The package seemed to be completely recyclable, which I liked...though it is sometimes hard to just discard something like this box which looks so nice and useful.  Darn you, Apple, for this trend of making packaging prettier than the product.<br /><br />-It came with a USB power brick that is horizontally oriented, which I find to be the best use of space on an outlet.  It only sticks out about an inch from whatever outlet it is put in.<br /><br />-The TV I'm using it on has the HDMI port on the back, and the device itself stuck out about 2.5 inches.  This TV is on an articulating arm, so that's not an issue, though it could have been if it was wall mounted.  A 3 inch or so HDMI extension cable is included to get around this issue.<br /><br />-I initially tried setting it up on my Droid Bionic.  It warned me that I was not using an approved operating system (Android 4.1.2 ??), but I went ahead and attempted.  It had me connect the phone to the chromecast SSID, and when I switched back to the browser, it tried to reload and had no connection...I no longer had the button to click on to move forward.  So I switched over to my laptop running Linux Mint 15.  Again the message regarding having an unapproved operating system, but the setup worked fine through Chrome on that laptop.  Within seconds, I was streaming youtube using the Chromecast Tab extension.<br /><br />-I called in my daughter with her iPod Touch (5th generation), and she pulled up the Netflix app (which she already had running...it's ALWAYS running).  It had the Chromcast button, but the app was frozen.  She switched over to the Youtube app, and right away was able to stream from there (Nyan Cat, much to my chagrin).  After rebooting her iPod, the Netflix app worked fine as well.  We watched an episode of Psychwhile fixing dinner (this is on the Kitchen TV).<br /><br />-After that, my son got the Chromecast plugin installed in Chrome on his desktop (which is hardwired to the network...some reviews have stated that only devices on WiFi will work...I'm not sure why this would the case...the Chromecast should have no way of knowing if a device is on WiFi or Ethernet, just that they are on the same subnet).  His streaming worked fine...however this set up a battle of devices between him and my daughter...Adele would suddenly be replaced by a colorful snippet of Samuel L. Jackson delivering one of his signature lines.  Ahh, teenagers.<br /><br />-The last thing I tried was bringing up a browser based webcam app on my laptop, and using the Chromcast Tab plugin to broadcast my face into the kitchen.  That worked fine, and resulted in some \\"WTF\\" moments for those passing through.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very pleased with the purchase, and will probably be purchasing additional units for the other TVs in the house.  We have other devices that have Netflix, Youtube, Amazon, etc. embedded, but have sometimes reverted to using the laptop connected with HDMI because the web based searching interface is so much better, or the device has decided that it needs to update its software...which means a 20 minute wait before you can get to your content.  This will shortcut that process.  I'm a little disappointed with my Droid Bionic not working (the button in the Youtube app is not showing up)...but honestly I didn't give it much of a try, so it didn't affect my feeling that this is 5 stars (it would probably be 4.5 if they allowed that).
B00578FKVE|5.0|Forget T3 and T4!  Each episode of this series is filmed in movie quality HD, and fits like a glove with the events of T1 and T2, the classics!
B00DURGZHW|4.0|Not as good as Take Shelter (same director) but still worth watching.  Cast, camera work, music, dialogue were all really good.
B00BPA6XUK|5.0|This soundtrack has been on repeat play ever since I came across it on Spotify and that has continued now that I have the CD.  Far more orchestral than the Daftpunk collaboration on TRON Legacy to which this is often compared, I do not know just how much M83 contributed to the project (not being familiar with M83 themselves/himself/herself? makes it hard to identify their input) but the results are very successful.<br /><br />To top it off, the film music builds beautifully to the &#34;closing credits&#34; and the song and piano piece that brilliantly concludes the album.
B002SS8S7E|5.0|Great movie lots of great action.....just wish I cud have used CC thru my Sony Blu-ray player but cudn't do it
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Zimmer has a tendency to either recycle themes (Gladiator/The Rock/Pirates etc etc) or come up with something entirely new - or seeming so.  Thankfully this is one of the latter.<br /><br />Eschewing the established iconic John Williams theme, Zimmer carves out his own theme for the Man of Steel, and whilst perhaps not as immediately memorable the results are a perfect fit to the new, grittier yet more epic scale of this take on the character, combined as they are with quieter, simpler and more reflective themes.
B006UN3K4O|5.0|Well written, great ideas and makes a huge amount of sense. The author knows what he's talking about and conveys his knowledge into doable steps for the readers. It opened my eyes up as to what's going on with the opposite sex and made me more aware and respectful of my approach. Highly recommend.
