1400082773|5.0|Really an excellent book without any particular agenda, except learning of a young man's struggle to come to grips with his heritage and ancestry. It also offers a fascinating perspective of race relations in the United States during the 60's and 70's while simultaneously demonstrating the other negative side effects of European colonialism during the 19th and 20th centuries.<br /><br />I give this book two thumbs up and would recommend it even if the author was not about to become the president of this country.
B00000J7SS|5.0|I am not a reviewer as such, but, I feel that this is well worth the money at any price. It's as good as it gets, and that is why it is not inexpensive. Love it!!!!
B00003CXB4|4.0|My son loves the Lion King, so I was so happy to find the DVD on line.  I paid extra to buy the DVD in new condition.  When it arrived the disc looked new, but the packaging didn't.  I've seen this DVD before in its original packaging, and this product did not include the original packaging.  Some of the promotional material, for example, was missing.  That said, I don't really care that much about the original packaging as long as the disc arrived in great condition, which it did.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|The disc came in a sealed box, but when we opened it we could not get it to play.  We eventually tried washing it with soap and water, and that is how we finally got it to play. The movie itself is very well done, we especially like the graphics and the story line is thought provoking.
1439136653|5.0|You might say that at times this book could be \\"over the top\\" or have too many coincidences, but the story is really about luck and the lives of people around the main character, how they affect him and how he affects them. I love the way the book is set out - each chapter is an individual and amazing story that somehow in the end is important and makes a big difference in the course of the main character's life. The story takes us all over India (which was great to me because I have recently been to India and recognized many places, scenes and features of their culture). I think this is an amazing debut novel and everyone should read it if they have, will or want to see the movie.
0375842209|5.0|I just recently finished reading this book and the time was definitely well worth it.  The plot was fresh and enticing, and I found the characters to be realistic and to have many layers to their personalities and motives.  I admit, the writing style was a little difficult to get into, but once I did I could not put the book down.  Unlike many books that take place during the Holocaust, the war was not the main focus of the story.  It was about a girl who happened to be growing up during those times and who was affected by events relating to the war.  WWII was more of a backdrop to the story than the other way around.  I found this very refreshing and new.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|Watched this with my husband and my 20yr old daughter (she loves Brendan Fraser). It was funny. One part did make me cry (i'm usually a sucker for being emotional). However, it was a little cheesy with the special effects. With today's technology I expect a little more out of sci-fi movies.  Not enough action packed adventure for me. My husband didnt say much.
B000FBJAOG|5.0|It's been a few years since I read this book. I was writing my own novel at the time -- with zombies, of course -- and was considering exactly what kind of zombies should I have, and whether they should be the stumbling, idiot type or the rabid, fast type. (Eventually, I settled on a combination, slow, rabid types with variations, but enough about me.)<br /><br />I thought it was rather an obscure little book. And for good reason at that time. It was shelved not in the sci-fi section of my local brick&mortar bookstore but in the comedy section. Not one to read the biographies of the likes of Mel Brooks, I passed it by for months. Then one day, some enterprising bookseller moved it up to eye level and I noticed it on my way to the john, where I started reading it.<br /><br />The book has a couple of what are to me amazing characteristics. One, it is readable in the john, like People's magazine, or Hot Rod Mommas (cough, cough) but it's also good for an extended read, for instance in a doctor's waiting room where one has gone to see about the bite given you on the street by that nice looking drooling naked woman.<br /><br />The book is also cross-generational. I not only enjoyed, but so did my 18-year old son. Most things I read, he turns his nose up and says something like \\"too derivative,\\" by which he means he's played that video game before.<br /><br />The twenty-some illustrator I work with has read it, and alerted me to Brooks World War Z. My girl friend, who doesn't read sci-fi, but does read comedy, has read it.<br /><br />But what the book reminded me most of were my ill-fated days in Boy Scouts. My parents enrolled me, thinking all the activities would bring me out of my pathological day-dreaming. I rebelled after a few weeks, refusing to wear the uniform -- but I kept the Boy Scout handbook. I found all the applicable survival type instruction in the handbook much more interesting that the quasi-military types that infested the local church meeting hall every month. And I much preferred camping alone, where I could hear myself think and listen for strange things moving through the undergrowth.<br /><br /> The guide was a no-nonsense handbook to just what it claimed to be: surviving a zombie plague. There nothing about politics or socialiazation; just stay alive type wisdom. But the Boy Scout guide, had one weakness; It wasn't funny. There was no merit badge for drool humor.<br /><br />Which gives the zombie survival guide a leg up on the Boy Scout field guide. This little exposition really does belong in both the comedy section (as perhaps I do) and in the sci-fi second too. As brick&mortar booksellers have mixed horror in with \\"fiction and literature\\" it should be shelved there too.<br /><br />The only thing it's missing is a merit badges system for zombie killing. That and perhaps instructions on how to bake a potato in a coal pit. And as that derivative of my DNA, aka my son, never returned the book, I'm in the market for another copy.alone, where I could hear myself think and listen for strange things moving through the undergrowth.

B001F7MSFM|5.0|If you liked the first one you will difinately want to see the 2nd one.<br />If you didnt see the first one you should difinately watch them both. I love sci-fi movies. Movies that take you out of everyday and into a dimension of the unknown. It was captivating and exciting. I love to purchase the DVD's to watch at home so I can pause when I want or rewind if i didnt catch something. Having all the same characters return for the 2nd Hellboy is also a plus.  I highly recommend.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|This was my \\"first\\" exposure to RENT so I had nothing to compare it to.<br />I absolutely fell in love with the movie and all of the characters especially Tracie Thoms! I have all of my friends and family addicted to the movie now. I am now officially a RENT HEAD! I am so sad that I missed an entire decade of RENT. I loved the overall theme of the movie which for me was simply, LOVE, TRUE FRIENDSHIPS AND FAMILY! Tracie Thoms was so convincing in her role, it was so moving, I have cried every time, especially on the cemetary scene. I thought that everyone did an excellent job. It is so funny because, my favorite songs change from week to week and my favorite character changes from week to week;but, Tracie Thoms is my all time favorite! I was one of the people who paid the $20 to see the final stage performance at the movie theatre and I will be attending the stage performance in my city next month. TAKE A CHANGE ON THIS ONE, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Unsettling. Uplifting. Original. The story follows a Muslim boy growing up in the slums of Bombay (now Mumbai),India and his journey to freedom. The closest film I can think of that made me feel the same mixture of emotions as this film did is \\"Shawshank Redemption.\\" The plot is enthralling and the characters are griping. This film will take you on a ride you won't regret taking.

B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Clint Eastwood delivers another memorable screen character as Korean War Vet Walt Kowalski--a man who lets out more politically incorrect humor on his own than Black, Stiller, & Downey combined did in \\"Tropic Thunder.\\" The plot is actually very similar and touches on many of the themes as the 1980s classic \\"Karate Kid.\\"     GRAN TORINO is much more somber and violent than \\"Karate Kid,\\" but both films deal with characters from American & Asian cultures (here the Asian culture in question is Mhong) learning important lessons on life from each other that they couldn't or wouldn't learn from their own cultures. Whereas \\"Karate Kid\\" shows those life lessons being taught through learning karate, GRAN TORINO does so in a bit more intricate manner. Walt's Detroit neighborhood is changing along with the world and he isn't. A series of circumstances leads Walt to mentor his young neighbor Thao in what it means to \\"be a man\\" while coming to grips with what kind of man he has become.     GRAN TORINO is directed by Eastwood and shot in a similar style as his other recent hit involving an old man who's lost his faith and mentors a misfit kid--\\"Million Dollar Baby.\\" And just like \\"...Baby,\\" GRAN TORINO delivers a somber yet ultimately uplifting tale of friendship.
B000063TS9|5.0|A truly excellent CD from the performance and recording quality point of view. Friends who have heard it agree.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Good for a thrill. Not as original as it was made out to be, just the same concept as Godzilla on the loose in Tokyo with better SPFX. Creepiest scenes were those atop a tall, leaning residential building, and on a crowded bridge at night. How the actual story was told---via camcorder---was a nice touch. Has some good moments. Worth the rent, not worth owning unless you get it on the cheap. I hear by now Vinnie in the back alley on Seventh Street has a few good copies...
B001ACH4DS|5.0|My family and I thought this was a great CD, we have been David Cook fans and were eager to purchase his CD. We do not purchase many CD's so supporting some artists is important to us, this was one of them. Glad we did. :-)
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is a great album. The songs really help tell the story of the movie and the book. And the best song on the album, by far, is \\"Never Think\\" by Robert Pattinson. It basically sums up the movie in the song.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|What can I say? I just really thought this movie was great. It was deeper than most of the comic book stuff I've gone to. I think it had something to say about evil and good and the things we have to do when called upon. I loved Heath Ledger as The Joker. I know I'm not alone in that but he really deserves all the praise he's been getting. He was stronger than Christian Bale and much better than Maggie Gyllenhaal ( I can never spell that name right!) but I think the director did that intentionally and it worked. Overall, the characters were better than the story but I definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good, scary, big movie that makes you think. Don't let your young kids watch it, people! Come on and use a little common sense.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|The first season was so great, and left me wanting so much more that I picked the series up to read while I wait for season two.  The characters are superb, and I like that the series focused as much on minor characters as main (unlike the books) because all of the characters are complex and interesting.  Yes, even Jason, once you dig below the surface.  This show has everything; romance, mystery, horror, fantasy, sex, supernatural beings, humor... the list could go on.  I was so heavily engaged and attached to so many characters right away that I found myself very upset when certain characters died, which goes to show how much it pulls you in.  I also never saw the end coming with season one, I never would have expected the killer to be who it was!  I can't wait until summer when the next season arrives, but in the meantime I will finish the books and pre-order season one and recommend everyone else do the same!
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Can I just say that the one word that sums this movie up is FUN! It wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination but I loved just getting some chocolate ice cream and watching it. It was just like a hot fudge sundae on a sunny day. I've always loved Meryl Streep and she was great as usual. Goofy movie, yes but worth watching to pass some really enjoyable time.
0399215980|1.0|I bought this book as a part of a gift pack, with a cute blue stuffed elephant.  The book is so disappointing.  There are no words, so you make up your own story, which is fine and fosters creativity.  But when you start to make up words for the story, you find that the photos are implying that the mouse will only be friends with his own kind, another mouse.  Very disappointing.  I am trying to find a tolerant, accepting spin on the illustrations so I can \\"write\\" my own story.... not easy to do. IMO, the stuffed elephant is the only worthwhile part of the gift pack.
0575081406|5.0|The Name of the Wind is an excellent novel.  Rothfuss's voice flows smoothly, lyrically, without being flowery.  The character is complex and changes throughout the novel.  The plot is intriguing and unpredictable.  Certainly, some things are expected - he is legendary and therefore perfect, he attracts women like bees to honey, he started as a poor nobody to become the most powerful man in the land (i'm assuming), etc.  Can you have a high fantasy hero without at least some of the cliches?  The important thing is that Rothfuss teases us with the storyline, hints and reveals darker turns that keep me uncertain about Kvothe's true nature.  I am even interested in the double storyline, and usually I get bored and skip either the future or the past vignettes.    I have read a lot of fantasy novels over the years.  I have read at least one book from most of the popular high-fantasy writers, and in the past few years I have become bored and jaded by the choices out there.  Either the book is terribly predictable, the characters are flat, or the writing style doesn't suit me.  I can find practically put together Eragon from sections in different novels.    That being said, this is the first new fantasy book I have read for years.  I have finally found a fresh voice in fantasy, and I look forward to the next novel.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies. I own the regular DVD set, but after getting a Blu ray player, this was on the top of my list to get on Blu ray. I think they did a wonderful job of converting this 1989 film and was very happy they did. It looks so much better now. One of the all time great movies that appeals to men and women due to the masterful storytelling of Larry McMurtry. Not many writers have his talent for character development, and this movie does a masterful job of bringing those characters to life. Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones give the performance of their careers in this movie. Not many books are transferred to movies successfully, but this movie actually enhances the book. Great addition to a Blu-ray library (or any movie library for that matter).
0525478183|5.0|John Green and I had a slightly tumultuous relationship after I read Looking for Alaska. Many of my blogger friends absolutely loved the book and I simply didn't \\"get\\" it, therefore leaving me mentally arguing with Mr. Green as to why I was the only one missing something. Well. Both Mr. Green and myself have been redeemed after reading his latest, Paper Towns. I get it, I love it, and I'm not alone! The characters and the premise are just brilliant and I now have joined the love affair of John Green's young adult books. Finally!    Quentin and Margo are neighbors. They used to be best friends, but then Margo became one of  those unattainable popular girls and Quentin just stayed his same old self, not popular, but not really disliked either. Right before graduation, Margo appears in the window of Quentin's bedroom, late at night, insisting he take her on an all night adventure, filled with sneakiness, pranks, and a little destruction of property.    As fast as Margo reentered Quentin's life, she disappears and when no one can be bothered enough to look for her, believing she'll come back on her own time, Quentin takes the search into his own hands, following clues he believes Margo left for him. With the addition of Quentin's hilarious sidekick, Radar, the boys follow each clue and end up on an intense road trip, making friends they never thought they would have.    Though Margo was a bit irritating at times (she is incredibly self centered), I loved Paper Towns. Quentin was a great main character and Radar made for an awesome friend. The plot was unique and the infused mystery of where Margo could be definitely made this much more of a page turner than Green's previous novels. Her clues were incredibly well thought out...very impressive....and the lack of care on her parent's part was made to be very realistic feeling. I really enjoyed this one.    When purchasing the book, you get a cool choice of two covers. One has Margo smirking and the other has her looking very dark and angry. I'm still not sure which I like better...probably the yellow one. She certainly had a mischievous side!
B001ED7C58|5.0|Over all is pretty good. I like most of the songs. Shame did not include the second song of Pattinson. Worth the time and money. Most of the songs are great, and i think with their variety most people will like it. Very engaging and fun. Would have liked more pictures in it or choice of pictures.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Will Smith should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of Chris Gardner, a divorced homeless man taking care of his son while trying to pursue the American dream of stability, wealth, and happiness.  It is always refreshing to watch Will in a movie where there is no need for him to be the so-called tough guy (Independence Day, Men in Black, Hancock).
0312360266|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone that liked the Twilight series.This is also a very addicting series.
B0010VD7EO|5.0|I bought this cd because i really liked the song \\"electric feel\\" and often times when i buy a cd for one song, that ends up being the only song on the cd that i actually like. Not the case with MGMT's Oracle Spectacular, every song is truelly great. I find myself listening to the cd over and over again and never tire of it. Must-buy.
B001GQACGE|4.0|This CD is my introduction to Beyonce.  My daughter thought I needed to keep up with the musical times; so this was under the Christmas tree for me this year.  I was surprised at how much I liked the set.  \\"If I Were a Boy\\" builds nicely with a \\"grass is always greener\\" philosophy in the lyric, \\"Drink beer with guys & chase after girls; I'd kick it with who I wanted & never get confronted for it.\\"  On Melissa Etheridge's holiday CD [[ASIN:B001E2JN88 A New Thought For Christmas]], she takes many well-known Christmas carols and references them into her originals.  Beyonce takes the famous Franz Schubert song \\"Ave Maria\\" and creates a lovely ballad, \\"You are my heaven on Earth; You are my hunger, my thirst; I always hear this voice inside.\\"  It's a lovely track.  Rolling Stone magazine called Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)\\" the #1 single of the year.  It's a bouncy track that I'm glad to have heard.  While \\"Radio,\\" \\"Video Phone\\" & \\"Diva\\" don't resonate well for me, \\"Sweet Dreams\\" is pleasant.  From what I've read, I expect this is a transition album from an artist who is trying to mature & take her audience with her.  The bright spots on \\"I Am Sasha Fierce\\" make it a fine hello.  Enjoy!
1594489505|5.0|Hosseini's second book is as good as his first. In this book he takes us along to witness the hard realities of life in Afghanistan through the eyes of two women trying to lead normal lives. Something as simple as loving and being loved back is not so easy in certain societies and certain times. The novel starts prior to the USSR's invasion of Afghanistan and ends in a post 9/11 world. The story is sad, but it is so well written that you'll have a hard time putting the book down.  There are many themes in the book, but two strong ones are hope and perseverance.
B0017ANAZO|5.0|Warning:  minor spoilers ahead.    I found this remake of the 1939 film The Women to be quite enjoyable.  I was worried that it was going to purge all the bitchiness of the original, but some of that remained, and it is quite witty and clever in other places and ways.    Even though it makes about as much sense to me to compare the two versions of The Women as it does to compare Massenet's Manon to Puccini's Manon Lescaut or Puccini's and Leoncavallo's versions of La Bohème with each other, I'm going to do that anyway.  I'll say up front that I think there is room for both versions.    Contrary to what is implied in the trailer, the remake has more in common with the original than I had first thought.  It carries over several lines from the original, including two of the very best lines.  There are places where it is obvious that they are setting up to bring over one of the original wonderful lines and those sequences are lots of fun because of the anticipation that the line is coming.  The best line from the original (the one about the kennel), on the other hand, shows up with almost no warning and in a very different place, spoken by a different character.     The film doesn't follow the original scene-by-scene by any means.  There are some unusual plot twists such as having the phone call Crystal Allen gets at Saks Fifth Avenue, which is how it is known in this picture (as opposed to the thinly-disguised Black's in the original), take place at, rather than behind, the perfume counter, so that the women who are \\"creeping up on her\\" (this phrase is not carried over) get to witness the call.  Also the manicurist, who is called Tanya rather than Olga in this version, is brought back toward the end for an interesting plot twist.  There is a fashion show although in this version it is part of the story and not just a divertissement.  While the implication is there in the original that the writer character played by Jada Pinkett Smith has an alternative lifestyle, theyleave no doubt of that in this version.    There are differences, of course.  Bette Midler plays the fairly small part of the Comtesse de Lave, who goes by a different name, although she acknowledges that sometimes people call her \\"The Countess.\\"  While Buck (different last name, which I don't recall) is mentioned, nothing really comes of that subplot other than the implication that the Comtesse may end up making him husband number six.  Buck never gets involved with Crystal either.  The biggest change is the character of Sylvie (rather than Sylvia) Fowler, who does not gloat over Mary Haines' sufferings; she feels genuine remorse at having played a part in the publication of the story of the fight between Mary Haines and Crystal Allen.  She is loyal to Mary Haines throughout the film, even during the disruption in their friendship, and so she never makes friends with Crystal Allen.  In fact, it could easily be argued--especially on the basis of one of Mary Haines' lines--that Mary's relationship with Sylvie is more important to her than her relationship with Stephen.  Little Mary obviously thinks very highly of Sylvie as well.  Then again, this is much more a pro-woman picture than the original.  It was probably influenced to an extent by Sex and the City from what I gather (I haven't seen it), so it only makes sense that the women would take their relationships with each other very seriously.  Another difference is that there is one male character in this version although it is entirely possible that that character is at least played by a female.     Accordingly, since Sylvie and Crystal never become friends, Sylvie is not involved in the scene in Crystal's bathroom.  That scene, now only involving Crystal and Little Mary, brief as it is, tracks the original more closely than any other part of the film, or maybe it only seems that way because Eva Mendés has obviously studied Joan Crawford and her speech patterns and reactions in that scene very closely.  There is another superfluous and not really believable--or maybe it is, in a way, given the way things are nowadays--plot twist involving Crystal, who otherwise does not reappear in the film after the scene in her bathroom, that comes out during the closing credits.     I thought it bogged down a bit about two-thirds of the way through the film, and perhaps that was because that was the place where it diverged the most from the original.  On the other hand, there were certainly places where I found the lines funny or where I was completely engaged in the film where those sections had nothing to do with the original.     I don't follow modern films that closely so I'll avoid detailed comments on the actresses.  I'll simply say that I thought the acting was good throughout and I really liked the girl who played Little Mary.  I wouldn't say she was better than the original, whose character and acting style was very much of that period.  The one actress in this film whose work I am familiar with is Debra Messing, from Will and Grace, and I must say that she has amazing breath control as is evidenced by the final scene.  The trailer made it look as though her role was much more prominent than it turns out to be, possibly to take advantage of her being possibly the best known actress of any in the film.  She is very important in the heartwarming ending, however.  Some of the important characters from the original are missing, such as those played by Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine.  Thre is no divorce ranch so there is no Marjorie Main either.  I wish the wonderful Carrie Fisher had had a larger role.     Anyway, aside from the little bit of time where the film bogs down in the middle, the two hours went by pretty quickly.  The Women is certainly a better film than the reputation it has garnered.  Comparing it to the original film, I probably would have only given it four stars.  However, since I think the film stands well on its own without reference to the very different original (which I also love), I'm giving it five.

0785814531|5.0|Read troughout the world, admired by Dostoievski and translated by the famous French poet Baudelaire, Poe has become a legendary writer, representing the artist as a romantic failure. A lot of his stories seem a description of the frequent nightmares he had.<br /><br />But his popularity and his influence on literature - even today -depend less on nightmares than on his accomplishments as a writer of fiction and as a great lyric poet.<br /><br />'The fall of the House of Usher' and 'The Cask of Amontillado' show Poe's mastery of Gothic horror. His 'The Pit and the Pendulum' is a classic of horror and suspense. He invented the modern detective story with ' The Murders in the Rue Morgue '.<br /><br />But he was also a great poet famous for the lyrical 'To Helen' and for the incantatory rhytm of 'The Raven'.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|Sequels are iffy; sometimes good, mostly disappointing. Frankly, this didn't disappoint.<br /><br />It won't enrich your life, or enlighten you, or lead you to a vision of heaven.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's a perfectly good story, and the special effects give it a nice texture; it's a popcorn-worthy adventure movie.<br /><br />The plot is simple, with one subplot; a bad fairy (who looks like a vampire) wants control of an army of unstoppable robot-thingies. He kills his father to get control of that army, but then has to find the map to the army, and the missing pieces of the control device (a crown) to further his dark ambitions. Oh, yeah; his twin sister is the love interest for the fish-guy in the movie who is Hellboy's sidekick.<br /><br />There are a lot of fights, monsters, including cute tiny monsters like the tooth fairies, all leading up to the big finale fight where Hellboy fights bad fairy guy.<br /><br />There's an emotionally satisfying end for the movie when bad guy's sister finishes him off at the ultimate cost to herself. Fish guy morns, and we get a mostly happy ending.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|This is one of the best Rush DVDs to date. The beginning of it was hilarious--it's nice to see a funny side. THe clarity of the picture and the mix are dead nuts on--I wish I had the Blu Ray version of this because even through my PS2 the picture is crystal clear. These guys pulled out some great hits from Permanent Waves, Signals, and Hemispheres that I have never heard live and it was great hearing and seeing it since I had to miss their trip through Phoenix. Neil Peart, as always, gives the audience his signature drum solo that no one else can hold a candle to. Can't wait to see what these guys pull out of their magical hat next.

0545128285|5.0|\\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard\\" is a book of five fairy tales taken from the world of Harry Potter. The title story is featured prominently in the final book in the Harry Potter series, \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.\\" There are also four other relatively short stories full of J.K. Rowling's imaginative wit and flair. While I enjoyed all of the stories very much, my favorite part of the book was the informative (and sometimes very amusing) commentary on each tale written by Professor Dumbledore, which sheds additional light on each story as well as provides interesting perspectives on the Muggle and wizard worlds. This is a very quick and enjoyable read, and a must-have for all Harry Potter fans.

As Lord Phillips says in the Foreword, the new offences now created raise a host of novel and difficult problems in the global battle against corruption.<br /><br />\\"Corruption and the Misuse of Public Office\\" remains a highly topical book. In keeping with many legal books recently published, the authors started off the first edition with a classical reference to the many-headed Hydra - cut off one head and two appear in its place - just like corruption, and they have repeated it for this edition!  The four authors are realistic enough to recognise that their taxing labours (unlike those of Hercules) will be important considerations for the future as international society continues to burn out the roots of corruption...if it can.<br /><br />Colin Nicholls and his three colleagues have produced a most worthwhile second edition with an excellent foreword by Lord Phillips.  By far the most important theme is the global problem.  Recent events have shown serious difficulties in what should be considered `corrupt' because some countries have very different views from others as the UN and EU acknowledge.<br /><br />Lord Phillips described the book as filling a large gap in our understanding of this area of law. He succinctly describes the work as a valuable tool for those bent on attacking an evil which, if left unchecked, can infect the life of a nation.  Phillips could add to this view the problem of lasting damage and the undermining of standards which are playing such an important concern for all in modern political life at the beginning of the twenty-first century after the expenses scandal.<br /><br />The greatest attribute of this edition is to bring together, in one source, a wide range of primary and secondary legislation together with international treaties and agreements.<br />The authors have succeeded in their aim of coverage of not just UK and ECHR law, but also the large amount of international comment and numerous publications as well.<br /><br />They explain that corruption has little regard for national borders and Lord Phillips' original statement baldly introduced the issue when he said \\"The World Bank estimates that 6% of the world's economy was paid in bribes in 2004\\".  Not comfortable reading even now but indicative of a problem which, like the internet, has no boundaries as such and is a problem all countries must face together.<br /><br />As the only dedicated work in this subject, four aims are achieved:<br /><br />*stating the law relating to corruption and misuse of public office in a clear and accessible manner;<br />*examining the legal and practical issues relating to the investigation and prosecution of corruption by providing practitioners with a full guide to the handling of a corruption case;<br />*analysing the regulatory mechanisms for dealing with standards in public life; and<br />*the production of extensive coverage of the international efforts which are being made to combat corruption, giving practitioners the ability to use the information published with confidence where they are handling cases which involve foreign officials.<br /><br />The authors have extensive experience in handling criminal and civil aspects of corruption cases and the current law on corruption and misuse of public office is clearly stated.  Of particular relevance are the examinations of legal and practical issues relating to the investigation and prosecution of corruption cases with the inclusion of information on whistle-blowing and the recovery and repatriation of assets.<br /><br />The global connection is never far away, and this book gives practitioners the ability to handle any aspect of a corruption case by the use of a detailed analysis of the international efforts to combat corruption, and the legal developments which are taking place globally in areas of interest to the United Nations, the European Union, OECD and the Commonwealth.  UK Government agencies will find this book particularly helpful.<br /><br />Lord Phillips says that this book fills a gap.  Yes, it does, but only partially. The authors realise only too well that their work is not yet finished and that it has probably barely begun as initiatives to fight corruption remain somewhat neutered by certain world powers.<br /><br />This worthwhile and valuable contemporary book is now the established work on corruption from the experts. We said of the first edition that a new government should grasp the entire nettle system when it had promised to burn the root out of what seems now like so many years ago.<br /><br />The trouble is - corruption and misuse still remain there but we have some moves in the right direction with the latest legislation at least for the new edition which is most welcome!<br /><br />FIRST EDITION<br /><br />The Global Battle Against Corruption<br /><br />This is a highly topical book at a time when `cash for honours' is top of the domestic political agenda in the United Kingdom.  Actually, the book is about a great deal more than possible wrong-doing at 10 Downing Street.  In keeping with many legal books published in the last year or so, the authors start off with a classical reference to the many-headed Hydra - cut off one head and two appear in its place - just like corruption!  The four authors are realistic enough to recognise that their taxing Labours (unlike those of Hercules) will be important considerations for the future as international society continues to burn out the roots of corruption...if it can.<br /><br />Global Concerns<br /><br />But Colin Nicholls and his three colleagues have produced a most worthwhile book with an excellent foreword by the Lord Chief Justice.  By far the most important theme is the global problem.  Events during 2006 and 2007 have shown serious difficulties in what should be considered `corrupt' because some countries have very different views from others as the UN and EU acknowledge.  Lord Phillips rightly describes the book as filling a large gap in our understanding of this area of law. He succinctly describes the work as a valuable tool for those bent on attacking an evil which, if left unchecked, can infect the life of a nation.  Lord Phillips might add to this view the problem of lasting damage and the undermining of standards which are playing such an important concern for all in modern political life at the beginning of the twenty-first century.<br /><br />One Source<br /><br />The greatest attribute of the book is to bring together, in one source, a wide range of primary and secondary legislation together with international treaties and agreements. I met Mr Nicholls and his co-writer, Tim Daniels, last year, and I was greatly impressed by their clear and detailed knowledge and experience of what is a very confusing area of law both to the British and for many overseas businessmen and politicians.<br /><br />The authors have succeeded in their aim of coverage of not just UK and ECHR law, but also the large amount of international comment and numerous publications as well. They explain that corruption has little regard for national borders and Lord Phillips states the facts baldly introducing the issue when he says  \\"The World Bank estimates that 6% of the world's economy was paid in bribes in 2004\\".

B0013ND30M|5.0|I was very excited to receive this product so quckly and in great condition. Thanks!
B000P12LWY|5.0|This show is awesome!!! It might not be the MOST accurate to date, but it is awfully entertaining, exciting, and overall somewhat historical! The actors are brilliant, especially JRM as King Henry! You will not be disappointed if you are looking for great entertainment! Cant wait to receive Season 2! :)
B00003CXB4|5.0|product was new and in the original factory packaging as advertised.  delivery was fast and reasonable. will do business again.
B00000IFP6|5.0|Allow me to rave. This complete Beethoven Symphonies set with the Tonhalle Orchester Zurich conducted by David Zinman is the best in the world right now. Period. It is luminous and enlightening, fresh and energizing. Allow me to put that into context a little bit.    Conducting and performing Beethoven has been popular ever since Ludwig van B. himself did it, practically. Unlike other composers who have periodically fallen into and out of the limelight, Beethoven has enjoyed enduring acceptance of some level (although some of his individual works have suffered fluctuations in popularity, being overshadowed, and all the rest of that unforunate business).    Coming out of the Late Romantic era, over-the-top was the name of the game in music. Mahler, better known during his day (the 1890s and 1900s) as a conductor, was partially responsible for this trend. His own symphonies reflect this - grandiose, over-the-top, rather long, and with a (very) healthy dose of ego - not to mention requiring a number of musicians larger than is practical in most ensembles today. Conducting up until the past few decades has reflected this trend - we find fascinating examples of this, for example in Leinsdorf's recording of the Ninth with extra trumpets added at moments in the Scherzo, most likely to add \\"oomph.\\"    Zinman seems to know all this, and has said something to the effect of, \\"Look, that's all very good: tradition is great, but let's try something different.\\"    What blows me away still, as I relisten to Zinman's recordings over and over, is how effective Zinman makes his Beethoven without these aforementioned \\"orchestral gimmicks.\\" He uses slightly faster tempi than were common during the LP era, which belonged to conductors like Karajan and Toscanini and Klemperer and others. This never feels hurried - in fact, I find it refreshing. For example, Zinman's Eroica, first movement, is so much livelier, more transparent, and cleaner than other recordings of this sympony that it'ssimply electrifying. I can easily extend similar praise throughout all of this wonderful set, but Eroica is one that stands out to me, having recently played it.    Another facet of this recording is one that carries a controversial tag - \\"authenticity.\\" I don't mean in this instance finding Beethoven-era instruments (they don't), or even trying to emulate the style of playing from that era (there's just no way to know). Instead, what Zinman uses is a carefully-researched Barenreiter edition of the scores that contains a few surprises for those who are still stuck in the Karajan age of Beethoven and a much, much healthier respect for what Beethoven wrote than any other major recording I know.    For example, the cello-bass recitative in the last movement of the Ninth is much closer to what one would normally find in, for example, a Mozart opera: conversational and flowing. Contrast this with the way Karajan handles the low strings his 1963 Ninth, for years the yardstick: gruff, heavy, almost apocalyptic in its seriousness.    The size of his orchestra, too, is much closer to what would match Beethoven's available forces. This recording lists every person playing in every symphony - it's fascinating to see what changes between each symphony and listen to see if you can hear the size of the orchestra, which you often can.    If you are looking for a Beethoven Symphonies collection, this is the one. At <$30 and usually about $20-25, it's an even better deal. If you are used to traditional Beethoven's this recording will surprise you in many ways. It sure surprised me - and won me over. David Zinman and Tonhalle Orchester Zurich have recorded the new yardstick for Beethoven's Nine Symphonies since Karajan's 1963. Nothing even comes close.

B001CTA1S4|5.0|The 1960's, just after Vatican II. A popular, progressive priest, new to the parish of St. Nicholas. The parish school has been run for years by a conservative, by-the-book nun, who believes that discipline and tradition are paramount. When a new, young teaching sister hesitantly voices suspicions about the priest's relationship with an altar boy, the principal vows to bring him down.<br /><br />Rarely has a film received a more appropriate title, for it centers upon the possibility of sexual abuse without ever clarifying the truth of the matter. Sparks fly between Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who despite the heated dialog manage to turn in exquisitely subtle performances. Equally impressive are Viola Davis in the role of the child's mother, and Amy Davis, who, like the audience, cannot decide what to believe. The rest of the cast, especially the children, is picture perfect, the visuals evocative, the music understated, the direction tight. This is a film that should garner many awards in 2009.

B001H5X7JS|1.0|I rented this movie based on a suggestion from a friend who told me it was hilarious. I guess maybe I just don't \\"get\\" this kind of humour. The opening first few minutes with the fake trailers was mildly amusing and showed hope that the movie would pick up momentum. Like another viewer mentioned, it was all downhill from there. I think I may have laughed once or twice the entire movie. The script is absolutely terrible, you can actually feel the actors trying to be funny but just quite not making it. For the record, I am a Ben Stiller fan and find him hysterical in most roles. This movie is just a terrible, terrible dud.
B00005JNJV|3.0|Ok I am going to rant a little.I thought the movie was good for an action film,but for a Batman movie ,NO.They always have to change things that are from the the original story,Why.OH I forget,it's artistic license.BULL .Someone said that this makes the joker more real,like batman is real in the first place,he is a fantasy character,no human can do that stuff.they should of left the Joker the way he was.People can still read between the lines and get the hidden meanings.You do not have to make him more human for us to get it.Quit changing it,like making Raz al Ghul as Batmans teacher in Batman begins.   How about making the movie for us not your artistic selves.Become a painter if you want to be artistic.Well at least the cartoons usually stick to the original story line.   I said I just wanted to rant and this gives me a chance to say how I feel about these producers and their artistic talent crap.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game has solved our family's love/hate relationship with board games. Because it's not always clear who's winning until the final play, everyone can stay interested in the game even if they're not having much success. Catan plays a little faster than your Monopoly-type game (though inevitably longer than the single hour they tell you it will take on the box). Using resources and trade instead of money and keeping your armies in card form takes out the cutthroat nature of most domination games. The result is a competitive and addicting strategy game that actually comes to a peaceable conclusion as opposed to an abrupt end as the board flies across the room.    The game doesn't make sense until you've played it once through, so you have to just give it a try before declaring it too complicated. Once you get it, the basic premise and rules of the game mimic a feudal society to a surprisingly realistic degree. And it's not nearly as hard as the long instructions make it seem.    If your intended playing group is more than four, buy the 5-6 expansion pack. It's worth it. You do eventually get tired of Settlers of Catan. But you're more likely to realize suddenly that it's four in the morning and you've played three games straight without stopping for so much as a food break (true story). And, surprisingly, it's easier to forget who won, which never seemed possible before in our family.
B0017YDPI2|2.0|This review is not on the content but rather the pricing. This was  the season that took place during the writers strike. (The writers even poke fun at themselves in a returning episode when they call themselves \\"lazy fat cats\\".)<br /><br />My issue is why would I pay same amount on past season's DVD sets with full episode lineups when this one has half. I just cannot bring myself to do it. The extras are not worth that much.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book started well and then kept on getting better.  I enjoyed  the entire story.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|The DVD set of the second season offers some improved function in navigating through the episodes, including a \\"play all.\\"<br /><br />The first season was truly original, so it can't compare to this second one, but if you are a fan, these DVDs won't disappoint.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|In this futuristic action thriller, the deadliest prison is offering a way out of incarceration.  Win five races and you've got your freedom.      The subscription only TV show is a hit.  So much of one, that when their top driver Frankenstein is 86-ed, Warden Hennessey (Joan Allen) recruits a new driver by framing him for the murder of his wife. But Jensen Ames (Jason Statham) isn't going to play her game. He's got a baby daughter to come home to and that's his plan.    If you love car chases and nonstop action, \\"Death Race\\" is great.  There's not much plot here, but enough to keep the action pertinent.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2008
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|Oh. God. Make. The. Pain. Stop.......<br /><br />Okay, it wasn't the worse film I've seen, but it definitely ranks as one of the worst vocally presented musicals ever. Ever. Outside of the wonderfully talented young voice of Amanda Seyfried, I haven't heard singing this bad on film since Jack Nicholson in Tommy or George Burns in Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Even though Meryl Streep should be given the \\"Best Try\\" award for looking like she was having a good time while not showing embarrassment, \\"singers\\" like Pierce Brosnan sound like they were soulless barking dogs and needed to be put out of their misery. Sure, visually the movie is a fun romp, but if I hear Meryl either sigh, cry, or moan during each song again, I swear I'm gonna buy me a chalkboard and scratch away. I find it hard to believe the Broadway play it's based on is so huge, but then again it's based on music that helped define a generation...just not mine. Heed this warning: unless you are a bonafide ABBA fanatic or simply \\"ghey\\" for musicals, do yourself a favor and rent Across The Universe again than to put yourself through this. GACK!<br />(RedSabbath Rating:4.5/10)

Truth is, he's depressed after his divorce from Stephanie (Molly Sims) and it's just not getting better.     Then he runs into a friend whose life has totally turned around.  He attends a YES seminar by charismatic Terence Bundley (Terence Stamp).  Participants are taught to say YES to life and all its experiences.     This changes Carl's life.

0739367676|5.0|I really loved the Twilight saga...  Book 1 is my favorite, book 3 my second, but Breaking Dawn (book 4) comes in a very close 3rd.  I think the only mis-step in this book is in breaking away from the Bella's point-of-view (POV) in \\"Section 2\\" (which is written from Jacob's POV_.  I think until Midnight Sun is written from Edward's perspective that the books should've remained in Bella's POV.  Overall the beginning and the end were great!  I found it hard to read about Bella's suffering in section 1 and 2 but that offers a build up to section 3 so it ends up being worth it!
031606792X|5.0|I first saw the movie, then fell in love with the soundtrack and score. I purchased all books and loved them.  I'm surprised at some of the negative reviews for this book.  I'm wondering if they merely skimmed the book.  This was one of my favorites. I read it in three days.  I couldn't hardly put it down. Any of them actually.  They should make all of them into a movie.  Great book.  Worth having.
0553573403|5.0|I finished this book last night and have already purchased the next. A Game of Thrones has single-handedly renewed my voracious reading habits.<br /><br />First off, this book is very unique. I have read quite a bit of fantasy and I have never read a book like this. After finishing it, I'd say it's a mix of Tolkien and Shakespeare. There will be tragedy and characters you love will die and not be revived with magic or some other poorly contrived plot twist. It's also harder to tell who the good guys and the bad guys are. It feels as if this book mirrors real life in that everyone has their own ambitions and reasons. It's a very fresh take on fantasy.<br /><br />Character development is superb and I have never cared about characters so much before in any book. Not even The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, which are (were) my two favorite books of all time. You will really grow to care about these characters.<br /><br />That all being said, I can see why some people wouldn't like this book. For starters, it's fairly long and lacks constant action of some newer fantasy novels: Forgotten Realms/Dragonlance etc. You have to invest some time reading before you get a pay off. Also, it has some very adult themes (incest, forced sex, to name a few).<br /><br />I've read stacks and stacks of generic fantasy books and they are great if you just want to read about some Orcs getting beat down all day long. But if you want to read a masterpiece and truly be moved by some literature then I whole-heartedly recommend this book.
B0000041CZ|4.0|This is not a hitorically informed reading! It sounds a bit crazed in places to be honest, but is also often very beautiful. Not what you shoud have as a first recording, but Bach especially responds to an indivdual approach, and this shows the WTC I in a new light. Pretty good sound.
1594201927|3.0|\\"The Ascent of Money\\" begins with a high-level overview of the current financial crisis that adds little to most readers' understanding.  Then its on to why Venetian merchants had to come to the Jewish ghetto if they wanted to borrow (Christians lending money were subject to excommunication; Jews could lend money to Christians, but not fellow Jews), how the Rothschilds shaped the outcome at Waterloo (loaned/provided gold for British supplies on the Continent) and the American Civil War (refused credit for the South - Jefferson Davis had earlier advocated repudiation of state debts, the North blocked Southern cotton shipments by seizing New Orleans (other ports?),  widespread losses in France's Mississippi stock venture eventually led to royal bankruptcy and the French Revolution, and Germany being hobbled in WWI because it lacked access to the international bond market.  Unfortunately, the causal links in each case are only claimed, not proven, and seem more than a bit stretched.
B001EYU1VO|4.0|I purchased this product because I am also using Saitek's ProFlight Yoke and Rudders, and the SST software.  I was using a Logitec joystick, and wanted a stick that was compatible with the SST program.   The SSt is great for creating different profiles for different games, or even different planes.  For instance, I have one profile for flying off a carrier, where I programmed buttons for extending the tailhook, arming the catapult, etc.    I have not spent a lot of time flying with this stick yet, but so far, it lives up to expectations.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|It's amazing what happens when you bring a practically no-name director and allow him the ability to spend millions and millions of dollars on a franchise like Batman. To some extent, I think of Christopher Nolan as George Lucas. He hasn't directed more than 6 films, and yet he's brought in millions for the movie studios. The Dark Knight, in my opinion, is completely worth the fanfare it received.     Heath Ledger, Christian Bale, etc. all did a fantastic job. The storyline is extremely well thought out, and truly expands upon Batman's growth. What really sets it apart (and Batman Begins is the same way) is that the story is more real to life versus the previous Batman movies. The previous Batman movies were more comedic.    Now, on to the Blu-Ray portion of this movie, and if it's worth it. Similar to others, I did feel the 2-disc set was a little disappointing in terms of the amount of special features content, but what was there definitely was interesting. The little shorts on making certain portions of the film were extremely interesting to me. Some for instance, were that they really crashed a lamborgini, really blew up a building when they \\"blew up\\" the Gotham hospital, really crashed a helicopter, etc.      Finally, blu-ray really shows how amazing a movie can be. The Dark Knight shines in HD, and, no wonder, Christopher Nolan chose to film it in IMAX originally.
0385334206|1.0|Sorry, I just didn't get it. I liked Slaughter House Five. Vonnegut shows many signs of being a brilliant writer, even though I didn't understand the story. I knew much of it was satire, I just wish I could understand it. Since this is a very simple book to read I would actually recommend it, despite my low score.
B0012Q732O|1.0|I kept thinking to myself in the first 5-10 minutes, I should just turn this off.  I really should have.  It doesn't get any better as you keep watching.  Save yourself the time and watch something else.
B000IMUYJM|3.0|Black Christmas is a fun, old slasher pic. One that eschews most of the slasher film formulas for the better (not surprising since this was done before there was a 'slasher film' genre). The characters behave realisticly and they respond to threats in ways that won't make you angry.<br /><br />The movie has a nicely creepy opening and a terrific half hour of an ending. The problem is that there's forty minutes or so in the middle that is sorta draggy. It isn't wasted time or anything, but maybe shoul have been paced better.<br /><br />Still, 'Billy' is genuinely scary. The obscene calls will make your flesh crawl and that 'eye behind the door' shot really haunts me. Easily worth watching (and [[ASIN:B000MM0LIM the remake]] isn't as bad as you've heard either).
031606792X|1.0|My thoughts on this book have been already posted by several other reviewers.    Generally:  We were 17 again!  We were in love!  Now, we're completely disgusted and confused.    The trust between the author and the reader has been broken.    Skip this last installment if you can, but I imagaine you'll be curious anyway.    Just disappointing.    **edit**  Upon reflection, maybe this series is just one big metaphor for life.    Book 1:  Boy & Girl meet, fall in love.  Book 2:  Boy leaves.  Book 3:  Boy comes back.  Book 4:  Boy & Girl marry, have kids right away, and the child sucks the life out of both of them.    Caring for children is the roughest job you'll ever have.  At times, it is draining.  Probably more so, if the parents are teenagers.  Of course, I dont know how the Volturi would fit in -- maybe they can be the in-laws.

B000067FP8|4.0|This is a sequel to a beloved family horror classic that lives up to its predecessor in some ways and is a let down in others.  It gives the audience a new take on what happened to all the characters from the first film and puts them in New York.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Actually Angelina plays sub- and important role in this movie. Morgan Freeman also plays another important sub role. Angelina developed another type of cool play, maybe favor of her experiance as Lara Croft. Story is cool also as well as exciting, entertaining.
B001GKJ2DO|1.0|This rates as the worst movie I have ever seen. Shallow idiocy. My friend who invited me to see this movie with him apologized for choosing such a bad flick. I was only able to watch it all the way through because I did not wish to hurt my date's feelings. I don't know if I will ever be that polite again. Such a mindless extravaganza was painful to watch.

I would highly recommend this book to any one 13 years or 43 years old.
B00005S6K6|5.0|I ordered \\"Falling in Love\\" several months ago because of the very fine review by Ed Uyeshima, which I recommend (its one of the more \\"helpful\\" reviews below).  Most of my reviewing recently has been for \\"Vine Program\\" books.  Because of my increased reading, it took me a while to get around to watching the film.  Ed's review is more complete and better than mine.  The only reason I'm writing today is to mention a few additional points which contribute to the value of this odd little film.<br /><br />First, I wondered about the level of improvisation which occured between Streep and De Niro during their most important scenes.  The acting is extraordinary and goes well beyond what could possibly be contained in a screenplay or in the best direction.  If you want to see a dozen or so very high quality scenes, you should see this film, watch carefully, and enjoy what these two can do together.  Pay attention to their eye contact (or lack thereof), their timing, and how they both portray a variety of anxiety-ridden situations.<br /><br />Second, because the director did such a nice job with pace and reality, many reviewers were troubled by the apparent disconnection between the scenes of love and affection (after all, the title is \\"Falling in Love\\"), and the very accurately portrayed anxiety, guilt, hurt, and self serving behavior.  This I think is why the movie was interesting to me.  Before someone becomes unfaithul, they have to weigh a thousand times the consequences of deciding (in or out) of fidelity - to their spouse, their children, their friends, and to their personal history of everything which came after they started their lives with the spouse.<br /><br />I could easily imagine Meryl Streep wanting to leave her husband.  He seemed very creepy to me with his odd, stiff, and insensitive behavior.  And how about that ugy 70's beard?  Having unsuccessfully dealt with the loss of a baby made the disfunction of this childless marriage seem realistic.<br /><br />However, the portrayal of De Niro's spouse by Jane Kaczmarek seemed so genuine and decent, that it was difficult to imagine De Niro cheating on her emotionally or physically.  Either way, she still slapped him, and he deserved it.  \\"Falling in Love\\" wants you to imagine these star-crossed \\"lovers\\" as wonderful people who are just in bad relationships.  But by the end of the movie, its impossible to associate many decent qualities to either person, particularly the De Niro character. What about his kids?<br /><br />Finally, Meryl Streep is literally gorgeous in this role.  I suppose this is why many men cheat, and it makes his poor behavior more believable.  So they go far enough into the \\"affair\\" to successfully destroy their existing relationships, but apparently let the resulting discomfort prevent moving into this new relationship.  Then by chance (the same way they met), they meet again and presumably follow through, now that the past relationships have been cleansed.<br /><br />So, as many reviewers raved about the genuine love and affection portrayed throughout this movie, there was also plenty of the selfish as well, so that by the time it ended I felt relieved to be me back in my own life, and not one of these two people.iro's spouse by Jane Kaczmarek seemed so genuine and decent, that it was difficult to imagine De Niro cheating on her emotionally or physically.

0545128285|5.0|This is an enjoyable book and of course Harry Potter fans will inhale it in about one sitting. I liked it, I thought it was a bit of a cash in but then the money is going to a good cause, so fair enough.<br /><br />I wonder what J K Rowling's next full length book will be about?<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]
0545128285|4.0|This was an enjoyable read. The short stories did have moral tones without beating you over the head. I was able to complete the book in one sitting. If you do not like literary commentary you will probably not like part of this book. Fictious commentary is found after each story. Some of it is very funny if you remember reading \\"improving\\" stories as a child.
B00102F5WK|4.0|Though this political thriller makes its sympathies clear from the outset, it raises numerous issues that will make you think about the policies a democracy should condone in the name of fighting terror. It's not as black and white as it may seem to either side in the torture debate. The script here is intelligent, the acting very fine and much of the dialogue is in subtitles, lending some authenticity, even if the trick is becoming more and more of a film cliche. This is a very taut drama. Watch it.
0545128285|4.0|I read most of the reviews of this book and thought to myself, \\"Why are people taking this book so seriously? It's mainly a plot device to help further the understanding of the seventh book... And by reading the notes from Albus after each story, you further your understanding of why each story is an important element to Deathly Hallows...\\"<br /><br />I thought this was a really good idea. When reading the Deathly Hallows, I often found myself wondering to what extent The Tales of that Beedle and the Bard were. I understood the main reason behind the stories, but never actually appreciated them until I actually read them in full.<br /><br />My recommendation is to read this book AS you're reading Deathly Hallows. Then, you can not only immerse yourself fully into the book as I assume Ms. Rowling would want, but you gain the much better appreciation to the reason why the stories made the major impact that they did to Harry and the other characters.<br /><br />I gave this book a 4 because, yes, it is really short and I wanted more. But I also gave it higher than a 3 because I understood what Rowling was trying to do. I knew it's not supposed to be the great writing that she is famous for in the 7 novels. These were supposed to be written in the 1500's after all, so the stories aren't going to have the same writing style as the rest of the Harry Potter series...

Since my boyfriend checked the mail, he inadvertently found out what his birthday present was before his birthday.

B001CTA1S4|5.0|In \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\", Meryl Streep armored herself in an icily glamorous veneer, striking terror into the hearts of subordinates with a deadly combination of haughty contempt and soft-spoken venom.  Her turn as an Anna Wintour-ish magazine editor was funny, yet subtle, never succumbing to over-the-top theatrics that would have propelled the performance into caricature.  As the formidable Sister Aloysius in John Patrick Shanley's new film version of his Broadway hit, \\"Doubt\\", Streep again assays the role of an unlikable character, this time with a terrifying earnestness that eschews subtlety for the ferocious passion of a woman for her beliefs.      Set in an urban Catholic school circa 1964, \\"Doubt\\" unfolds in a rapidly changing America that many aren't yet ready to embrace.  The Kennedy assassination is still fresh in everyone's minds, and the civil rights movement has resulted in the enrollment of the first black student in the Italian-Irish parish school.  The parish priest, a forward-thinking and open-minded (relative) newcomer, is destined to clash with the school's principal, an old-school, fire-breathing dragon of a nun.  When a question of priestly impropriety with the black student arises, all hell breaks loose, as Sister Aloysius jumps at the opportunity to rid her world of a man whom she clearly considers unworthy of wearing the robes of the priesthood.  Whether her certainty of the priest's guilt is a manifestation of her dislike for the man, or a show of genuine concern for the welfare of the young student, becomes a point of contention between Sister Aloysius and the younger, sweet-natured Sister James who, naively, started the ball rolling in the first place.  As Sister Aloysius relentlessly presses on with her unofficial (and unsanctioned) witch hunt, the filmmakers play on the audience's doubts, not only about the nun's motivations, but whether or not the priest actually engaged in an improper relationship with the boy.      As already noted,Meryl Streep's Sister Aloysius is a force to be reckoned with.   A black clad harpy who eats nails for breakfast and has acid for blood,  she's a likely descendant of Vincent Price's witchfinder general in \\"The Conqueror Worm\\".  Utterly humorless, Sister Aloysius inhabits an archaic world in which everything can be viewed as either black or white, right or wrong.   There are no grey areas and, thus, no room for doubt.   That the times are changing is not lost on Sister Aloysius and, with her stern, strident face and quick, huffy mannerisms, the frustration is evident, even as she tries to enforce her sense of normalcy and values---her draconian Catholicism--on an institution that she fears will soon find her obsolete.   It is not just the boy's welfare that is at stake, nor that of the priest, nor even the Catholic Church---it is the future of Sister Aloysius, herself,  that hinges on evicting the interloper and his near-blasphemous (in her mind) ideas of progress and forward movement (thus calling into question the Sister's own authority).   But just when think you've had enough and are secretly hoping that the priest, Father Flynn, will throw this merciless, headstrong woman out of a window, the actress gives us something--a gesture, a look, a tone--to remind us that Sister Aloysius is not invulnerable, that she is a real person who, behind the corporeal severity,  is afraid and all-too-human.    Meryl Streep has long been regarded as one of the world's premier film actresses.  There's a reason for that, and it's on display right here in this film.  She has always had the ability to totally inhabit the characters that she's portraying, but in \\"Doubt\\", she goes a step further, causing me to momentarily forget that I was watching Meryl Streep giving a performance.  For the duration of the film, she actually was Sister Aloysius.  She's such a good actress that it's almost impossible to imagine her leaving the set to drive one of her kids to soccer practice.  Or goinghome to prepare dinner.   She's uncannily, impossibly, almost inhumanly good, and her performance in this film reminded me, once again, of what a spectacular talent she is.      For all of five minutes, Streep is nearly matched in the acting department by Viola Davis, a little-heralded actress who excels (all-too briefly) as the mother of the alleged victim.   The scene where she and Streep walk along a sidewalk, discussing the implications of what the Sister is suggesting, and the subsequent reaction of the child's mother, is shattering.  It is completely moving, without ever seeming maudlin or manipulative, the way plays-to-movies sometimes are.    As Father Flynn, Philip Seymour Hoffman does a fine job of bringing to life a conflicted, ambitious priest who wishes only to connect with the larger community and make the Church more inclusive, less intimidating.    Being parish priest, Father Flynn occupies a loftier position than Sister Aloysius (demonstrated when he casually takes over her desk during meetings), but to her, he clearly occupies a lower moral plain:  he smokes, he laughs and jokes with the students, he uses sugar in his tea---it's not a great leap from there to child molesting in Sister Aloysius' mind.   On the surface, Hoffman's Father Flynn is a sincere, genial character, but as with other Hoffman roles, there's something edgier (and possibly a little perverse) going on underneath; in \\"Doubt\\", the question of guilt is never proven, and yet the ambiguity of Hoffman's performance causes doubts to remain long after the movie is over.      As Sister James, the true moral center of the story, Amy Adams is (as usual) luminous, even without makeup, and brings a convincing emotional depth to her character.  Initially suspecting some sort of impropriety between Father Flynn and his pupil, Sister James almost immediately comes to regret her decision to confide in Sister Aloysius.   An immensely watchable actress, Adams seems to be branching out and testingher mettle in more serious pieces of work, after a string of frothy, feel-good films of varying quality.      In shifting his Broadway success from stage to screen, director Shanley does an admirable job of making a smooth transition; I never got the impression that I was watching a filmed play, and the (roughly) 105 minute running time flew by so quickly that I'm not sure I ever blinked.  Sitting in an audience composed largely of senior citizens, I noticed that not one of them got up to go to the bathroom during the movie, so that alone, speaks volumes.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I purchased this for my family for Christmas after reading all the positive reviews and awards it has won.  I wondered how anything this seemingly simple could be fun and hold the interest of kids who are conditioned to instant excitment from video games and adults whose choice of toys are electronic devices of some sort.  Let me first say that this is not one of those games where everyone will be chomping at the bit to open up and play after unwrapping it at Christmas time.  The game is basically a gray plastic box with a grid and various plastic shapes grouped into 4 different colors, similiar to Tetris pieces that you place on the grid.  Nothing fancy to look at and kids will probably push this present aside until all the other \\"flashy\\" toys are opened and played with.  But once they do, everyone will enjoy this very engaging, thought provoking, challenging, and addicting game and will want to play it time and time again.  It's rare to find such an intellectual game where all ages can compete.  The box says 5 to adult but to really appreciate the strategic content of the game, I would say that 8 to adult is more accurate.  It can be played as one game which takes about 15-20 min where the idea is to get rid of all or most of your pieces.  The ones left over are tallied with the player with the fewest points being the winner. Or you can play a set of games where points are tallied from each game and a winner is decided.  You place your shapes on the grid one at a time where they must touch another one of your pieces diagonally.  Play is then based on alternate pieces placed by each player..max 4 players.  Super fun, as challenging as the opponents are capable of, and a great framily game.
B001GZ6QDS|2.0|One would think that after all the money this movie made at the box office, WB would give us a quality dvd release. I bought the 2 disc 'special' edition, and i'm still trying to figure out what's special about it.    The 'bonus features' are a total joke... if you followed the stuff released before the movie came out on the net, well there's not much new for you in this. I recommend people get the single disc edition.    The movie itself is ok... since i got the dvd i find that i'm skipping a lot of parts, because it's just too long and it drags for me in certain parts. Heath Ledger as he joker is what saves this movie for me for sure. His performance is flawless.    I can safely say that for me personally, Batman Begins is a lot better than TDK.

To list this I plugged in what was on the item and a listing for it appeared without a picture on Amazon.  Therefore it is what it is, another edition of it that no one else has listed previously.  It is superb and contains a lot of bonus material provided by the writers, directors, and producers.  There are 45 disks!
B00004WEJZ|1.0|I am normally a fan of James Bond movies but \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is terrible.  While it is apparently supposed to be a remake of Thunderball, it ends up being something less than a cheap copy.  In fact, they reused character names and applied a new plot which does not make sense.  Very poor script.  My recommendation is to keep this movie out of your bond DVD library.
1602528942|1.0|My aunt and I had an 18-hour drive from the south back to NYC and decided to get a book on cd to pass the time. I love Nicholas Sparks, he is a wonderful writer, but the audio version of Dear John. I wanted so badly to enjoy the reader's story, but his accents were terribly cringe-worthy. We were trying so hard to listen past his voice and just hear the story, but it was inevitable--we had to shut it off. I was terribly disappointed. My theory was that the actor chosen to read for this had to be dashingly handsome. My theory was correct--he is gorgeous. But.....it's audio......?......If you can stand horrible southern accents that create an illusion of the characters as being unsympathetic and cold, then purchase this book on cd. However, I strongly discourage it.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|One of the worst films I've ever seen. Supposedly filmed with a handheld video recorder. I believe it, the worst camera that has ever been made. Picture quality is poor throughtout; very little of the 'monster' shown. Poor storyline, poor acting.  Deserves no stars.  Save your money, and your time.
B000P7V46C|5.0|This album baught Genesis into a brand new place completely. Steve Hackett was gone so Mike Rutherford had to double as a guitarist. In the meantime the bands music had entirely changed. This is the beginning of the 80's sound that would serve the band so well in the years to come. Obviously the emphasis is more on the beat and melody then before,the fusion and R&B elements becomming more obvious in the music then any kind of heavy prog rock sound. Also the songs are shorter-no 9-10 minute epics here. A large number of these songs fit into the ballad catagory such as \\"Undertow\\",\\"Ballad Of Big\\",\\"Snowbound\\" and \\"Many Too Many\\",which have a wonderful use of the piano and simplicity of melody. \\"Down And Out\\",\\"Burning Rope\\" and \\"Deep In The Motherlode\\" showcase Genesis moving their uptempo songs further into the sound of<br />\\"Squonk\\" from [[ASIN:B000P7V45S Trick of the Tail (CD/DVD)]] and away from,say \\"The Return Of The Giant Hogweed\\" from [[ASIN:B000002J1L Nursery Cryme]] seven years earlier. The general idea being that all elements of the folksy interludes and extended solos and passages Genesis had been known for were being replaced by a far poppier arena rock sound that kept a focus on one idea then trying fuse two pieces of music together. The fusion element is made stronger by more of collective playing sound,often in a somewhat improvised style. That comes to play on the two tunes that close out the album-\\"The Lady Lies\\" and the wonderful \\"Follow You Follow Me\\" find Genesis using their music more in the melodic sense-the overall sound is not only like that of progressive fusion but of a great deal of the synthesized R&B that was so popular around that time. Genesis were still in search somewhat of their future sound here but were heading in the right direction,especially for a trio. So at least in commercial (and in many cases artistic cases) it was far greener pastures for Genesis from this point on.
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch movies are usually love it or hate it affairs. Some think they are overindulgent ego trips, or pretentious, overly symbolic mishmoshes that need the cinematic equivalent of a Rosetta stone to decipher. Others, look on them as works of inscrutable genius. Lynch's range is actually quite remarkable. The 2 most normal and prosaic (in terms of plot structure) films he directed, THE ELEPHANT MAN and THE STRAIGHT STORY, exist at one edge of the Lynchian universe. At the other you have ERASERHEAD, WILD AT HEART, LOST HIGHWAY, and INLAND EMPIRE. David Lynch can be as coherent and sober as any other mainstream director, or he can be as wildly experimental and innovative as the most obscure artist. Elements of his style can be found in some of Spanish surrealist master Luis Bunuel's early films as well as the work of experimentalist Maya Deren. Although Lynch has asserted that he never consciously imitated anyone else, his admiration for movies like THE WIZARD OF OZ, SUNSET BOULEVARD, and REAR WINDOW, as well as the works of Kubrick, Fellini, and Bergman is well known, and themes and techniques from these are present in many of his own films. The 2 Lynch movies that fall somewhere close to center between the 2 creative poles, that blend artistic sensibility and originality with commercial accessibility, are BLUE VELVET and MULHOLLAND DR. They are mysterious puzzles, but also simply great movies that can be enjoyed on many levels, and like most Lynch films, better appreciated with repeated viewings.   MULHOLLAND DR. was the best film of 2001. It was the most daring, the most beautifully filmed, the bravest, and the most unsettling movie of that year. It had the grotesque elements Lynch is famous for. It had the sardonic humor typically present in his work. It also had from Naomi Watts, the best performance given by an actress that year. It's understandable, that people just scratch their heads and wonder what this movie was all about, but if they can separate the dream elements from the real, they will be on the right track. This is my interpretation so if you haven't seen the film yet and want to form your own opinions, skip the next 2 sections of this review.  Diane Selwyn was a small town Canadian girl who after winning a dance contest got the fame bug. After an aunt who worked in Hollywood died and left her money, Diane moved to Hollywood to try and make it as an actress. At an audition for \\"the Sylvia North Story\\" she met another more talented and glamorous actress named Camilla Rhodes who got the lead part. They became lesbian lovers. Diane took their relationship a lot more seriously than Camilla, who used sex more as a tool to advance her career. Camilla became a big star and kept getting small parts for Diane in her movies, but although wanting to remain friends, she tried to discourage the affair, especially after hooking up with a hot shot director (Adam Kesher). She invites Diane to a fateful dinner party at the director's house in the hills off of Mulholland Drive. At this party Diane relates her life up to this point. She sees characters at the party that will later populate a fateful dream. For example as she raises a cup of coffee to her lips she sees a character who in her dream will become a member of the mob who tries drinking an espresso and spits it out. She meets Kesher's mother who will become Coco Lenoix in her dream. She sees a cowboy that will become a controlling figure in the dream. It is also here that she sees Camilla kiss another actress (Camilla Rhodes in her dream) and hears the director make an important announcement regarding himself and Camilla. We don't actually hear the words of their impending marriage, because filmed from Diane's perspective the news has an impact on her much like the car crash we see at the beginning of the film. Diane knows that the lifeline to all her Hollywood dreams and aspirations has been severed, and she herself snaps. She meets a guy at Winkie's diner (Joe in her dream), gives him money and a photo of Camilla, saying \\"this is the girl\\" and is told to expect a blue key when the deed is done. After receiving the key, with the knowledge that her lover and benefactor is dead, Diane's paranoia is exacerbated by real guilt and her life quickly unravels. She hides away in her flat and has a dream. The first clue we are given in fact that most of the film deals with dream reality rather than temporal reality is in the title itself, MULHOLLAND DR., not MULHOLLAND DRIVE. We enter Diane's dreamworld at the beginning of the film (when the credits appear) and pretty much stay there for the first 2 hours. In the dream she is named Betty and Camilla is Rita (who took that name from a poster of Rita Hayworth). Rita becomes a victim of amnesia after a car crash on Mulholland Drive. The crash actually saved Rita from being shot by an unknown hitman. Everything in Diane's dream has relevance to her waking life, but some people inhabit different roles. Much of the material of the dream comes from reality but is refashioned by the subconscious and fueled by desires and emotions. In the dream state time, space, and identity exist in a state of flux. Diane can become Adam Kesher, who loses control of his life, has to hole up out of sight while sinister forces are looking for him, and has to be reminded by an angel figure \\"the cowboy\\" to adjust his attitude and go with the flow, something Diane in real life couldn't do. Diane's dream is part wish fulfillment and part retribution. In her dream Diane (Betty) is everything Camilla (Rita) was in life..talented, beautiful, in control, and on the way to stardom. She even catches the eye of the director Kesher on the set of \\"The Sylvia North Story\\". Conversely, in the dream Camilla (Rita) is the one who needs help from Betty to find her identity and avoid being caught and destroyed by sinister forces. Rita recalls the name Diane Selwyn, a person who may know her true identity. Betty and Rita track herdown to a low rent apartment complex, but there they discover Diane Selwyn dead on her bed, a rotting corpse. The facial features of the corpse are distorted from decomposition so the dreamer Diane (Betty) is unaware she is witnessing both the result of her act of revenge (Camilla's body) and her own morbid future. Rita then decides to change her appearance by wearing a blond wig. There is an identity transposition in this dream, reminiscent of the one in Bergman's great film PERSONA..even a shot of Betty and Rita in bed after making love, where their 2 faces seem to merge into one. In real life, Diane not only depended on Camilla, she vicariously wanted to live her life, to be Camilla. So,in her dream Diane saves Camilla from death and makes her into this perfect lover and soulmate, everything she wished for in real life. In a reversal of roles she even has Camilla try to become Diane by donning the wig. The dream starts very well for Diane (Betty) but an eerily fateful early morning excursion with Rita to a place called Club Silencio clues them into the fact that it's all been an illusion, with the cold reality of death looming on the horizon. Diane's mind had directed a wonderful alternate reality, but the dream ends and she wakes up to a nightmare..the nightmare of her real life. The final half hour of the movie is Diane's last day in the temporal world, but even here time and reality are in flux as flashbacks and hallucinations predominate. Unlike her dream world, here her delusions are all bad, depressing, menacing, and fueled by an hallucinatory paranoia that ends in suicide.    Because a lot of what we see or hear in a Lynch film is a result of feeling and intuition rather than calculation, they are open to various interpretations. Lynch himself has often stated that he doesn't consciously understand everything he creates, but trusts in the emotional truth of it. As a human being he draws from a well of feeling accessible to all of us, so although we are notprivy to the specific intentions of it's creator, his movies resonate with us on emotional as well as intellectual levels. They function as cinematic Rorschach tests for the viewer. We see what we want to see, and if it deeply affects us one way or the other, it has served it's purpose. The observer is emotionally connected , but part of the fun is playing detective and unraveling mysteries just as many of the leading characters do. Why did Diane become unhinged? What do the monster (bum) behind Winkies, the blue box, and the blue haired lady in the box above the stage at Club Silencio, represent? I have my own interpretations and there are many more floating around the web. There are subtle clues throughout the film that point to Diane having been a victim of sexual abuse by her grandfather as a child. This could partially explain her getting romantically involved with a woman instead of a man, having low self esteem, and violently lashing out when she feels abused and betrayed. I see the bum (monster) as Diane's self image after having Camilla killed. The image is one of horror and shame, an image she can't live with. It lurks behind Winkie's because that is where the hitman left the blue key after killing Camilla. It is where the demon inhabited her, where she became a monster. In other Lynch projects like TWIN PEAKS, the notion of an evil presence that can inhabit our bodies is very real. Lynch actually had a woman play the \\"monster\\". The man at Winkie's in her dream (Dan) who has this \\"awful feeling\\" and eventually dies at the sight of it is someone Diane actually saw in Winkie's at the time she paid off the hitman to kill Camilla. She sees him staring at her right after she acts on her demonic impulse to commit murder. This evil presence, call it the devil if you wish, is cunning. It can fool us into thinking it has our best interests at heart, send us an outwardly friendly but inwardly sinister old couple (who based on the jitterbug sequence before the opening credits are modeled after Diane's grandparents) to encourage us as we start our journey, and later release them as demons to hysterically mock us, and terrorize our fragile minds into committing the ultimate and final escape. Blue is the color of supernatural mystery for Lynch, and the blue haired lady is a symbol of cosmic truth, the supernatural, impersonal Reality that oversees the illusion and delusion of both the dream theater and the temporal world. She is always there, the mysterious truth above and beyond our mundane worldly consciousness. Everything in this film is presented from the subjective conscious and subconscious of Diane, but the blue haired woman is even present as an impersonal witness to the truth in her dream. After Diane shoots herself some wisps of smoke rise above her body appearing like a soul or spirit escaping from it's earthly prison, and we see a few fleeting images of both women who now inhabit the eternal realm of spirit. For Lynch, a believer in reincarnation from the Vedic Hindu tradition, their stay in the spirit realm will be temporary as they must pay their karmic debts in another lifetime. The last shot in the film is of the Club Silencio stage, and the blue haired lady high up in her box whispering \\"silencio\\"..the silence that remains after the illusory show called life, and the movie, ends. Life, like the movies, ultimately fools us into believing that what is illusory, is real. As for the blue box, I see it as a device to effect transitions between states of consciousness..from the dream state to the temporal world..and from the temporal world to the spiritual realm that exists after death and beyond time and space. Not everything in MULHOLLAND DR. has an easy explanation, but not everything in our lives and dreams can be easily explained either. As humans we are not designed intellectually to understand TRUTH in it's purest form. To Lynch, art is a gateway to Truth, and the illusory world of film can clue us into universal truths which are hidden to us in life (which is itself a grand illusion). Lynch blurs the lines that differentiate dreams from reality, or separate individual personalities. To Lynch, we are not masters of our fate and captains of our soul, but subject to inner forces beyond our cognition, some sinister and some beneficial. The Truth encompasses both good and bad, darkness and light. The struggle between both is an ongoing process within our psyches. Diane wasn't a bad girl. She was a good girl who fell prey to dark forces which all of us are subject to under the right conditions. At the end of this remarkable film we are left in a state of wonder tinged with feelings of deep sorrow and pity.   The inner reality certainly has a lot more to say than the outer, but MULHOLLAND DR. does touch on some matters everyone can comprehend. It has some important things to say about the film business and the nature of fame and celebrity, and it has important things to say about things we all can relate to, such as love, jealousy, guilt, and ambition..but these things aren't spelled out for you. They are more opaque than transparent. MULHOLLAND DR. is a visually stunning and aurally beautiful film. Lynch frequently uses sounds, colors, and objects as clues; a symbolic shorthand to describe emotionally significant elements of the story. Blue keys and boxes, red lampshades and curtains, telephones, flashing lights, the sound of the wind, and the buzzing of electrical currents, all have portentious meaning. Music is another important element that reinforces thematic structures. In BLUE VELVET, Roy Orbison's \\"In Dreams\\" was used that way, and in MULHOLLAND DR., Roy Orbison's \\"Crying\\" (Llorando), beautifully and emotionally sung in Spanish by Rebekah Del Rio, effectively sets the right tone. Ms. Del Rio is presented as La Llorana de Los Angeles. The legend of La Llorana gives a clue as to why the Orbison song is chosen and why it affects Diane's dream personas (Betty and Rita) so vividly. The heart wrenching lyrics speak of rejected love, loss and despair, and La Llorana exemplifies the devastation resulting from it, the horrible outcome Diane's subconscious tries unsuccessfully to bury in her dream. There are interesting soundtracks in many Lynch films, and they complement the strong visuals. I just can't imagine a Lynch film now without a brooding Badalamenti score. There are always interesting and amusing elements in Lynch movies that comment on his own personal experiences and illustrate his strange sense of humor. It is easy to imagine that Adam Kesher's meeting with the Castigliane brothers (where control of his film project was taken away), and Betty's audition process must have been reflections of real incidents in Lynch's career in Hollywood. MULHOLLAND DR. is a hybrid of Surrealism and Expressionism. In Surrealism, dream logic replaces reality, and in Expressionism, emotional response through internal conflict, supplant rational motive and pragmatic action. David Lynch is an artist first and a filmmaker second. Here, he has made a movie about a dream, about shattered dreams, and about the dream factory called Hollywood..an original and beautiful, but sad and fearful rumination on life and death in the City of Angels.    If you just want to sit back and be entertained for a couple of hours, I don't think you will enjoy this film, but if you want to be puzzled, astonished, and shocked out of complacency, as well as amused and entertained, watch MULHOLLAND DR. once, or twice, or even better, half a dozen times..and while you're at it, do the same for the other Lynch masterpieces currently available.
B0013FSL3E|2.0|My 3.5 year old son anticipated recieving Wall-e from Santa for at least 2 months.  As soon as he opened it up on Christmas morning he was ready to  watch it.  Well I'm sad to say that it did'nt keep his attention very long.  A couple days later I asked him if he liked Wall-e and he said, \\"Yeah, well it's kind of boring.\\"  That was my husband and my thoughts also on the movie.

B000002I99|5.0|Welcome to my Nightmare is an interesting album for Alice Cooper, because in my opinion, it's the first album that really shows us the dark and twisted side of Cooper, and most of the songs have that same twisted feel to them throughout the album.  The songwriting takes a step back so the atmosphere and sick lyrics get a chance in the spotlight.  The songs *are* still well written of course, like always, and many times even resemble what Alice was doing on the previous albums.     My favorite track is \\"Steven\\" because THAT is one seriously warped, disturbing little song there.  I just love the way Alice sings the line \\"and it will gooooooooo away\\" because it's bizarre, yet serious, and makes you think about mental problems.  But don't make the mistake in thinking it's a sad emotional melody.  Nope, just really really sick.  Love that one.      \\"The Black Widow\\" is really cool again because of the lyrics, but also the memorable guitar tricks.  The introduction to the song with the spoken vocals detailing how deadly the black widow is, is just AWESOME!  \\"Devil's Food\\" is really good too.  \\"Department of Youth\\", \\"Cold Ethyl\\", and \\"Escape\\" take us back to the early Alice Cooper days when the band wrote glam rock/pop rock songs that were extremely catchy.      Those who think this is the ultimate Alice Cooper album may be right, but honestly, it's REALLY hard to pick a favorite album by this guy
B001ACH4DS|2.0|I was very disappointed in this CD.  He is very talented, yet his debut CD is very boring.  All his songs but two sound exactly the same.  It is very difficult to distinquish which song is which.  Kelly Pickler's debut CD is so much more interesting than this one.
B001ACH4DS|2.0|Loved David in AI and was so impressed with him.  Waited expectantly for his CD but am very disappointed - basically I am underwhelmed.  Not very many of the songs grab me, and I'm not really singing any of them in my head except the stupid AI song Time of My Life.  Sorry, David.  Could be better.

1433502410|4.0|I've been looking at and using various study bibles for a few months now. I'm trying to find one that I can recommend for anyone--new believers to seasoned saints. I haven't ever used a study bible until within the last year, so the whole concept is rather new and unfamiliar to me; but I have gained ground and am much more comfortable with one in my hands. I have examined the NIV Study Bible and the MacArthur Study Bible prior to this review. The recent publication (October 2008) of the ESV Study Bible has raised the standard by which all study bibles will be judged. Its many features are easily accessible and full of value for all readers. (ESV = English Standard Version)   The online study bible that is available only with a purchase, has little to offer in the way of anything new for online study. In fact, it is quite limited. However, for those who prefer to do all their reading from a screen, the complete text with notes and cross-references is duplicated on the computer. One can also add personal notes.But other tools associated with online study are glaringly absent. There is no interlinear or words keyed to Strong's Concordance, or any other form of word study tool. It is simply the ESV Study Bible produced and accessed online.    Only those who purchase a physical copy of the ESV Study Bible have access to the online version.    I have found one great benefit of the online version. All charts and graphs that are in the ESV Study Bible are easily copied and loaded onto a PowerPoint slide. This can be an invaluable resource for Bible teachers.    For this article, I am reviewing the hard-bound edition.    It is a weighty volume at 4.8 pounds, because of the sheer amount of material within. It is not too heavy, though, as this photo will show. Its physical dimensions are 2 1/4 inches thick, 9 1/2 inches long, and 6 3/4 inches wide.    Some of the features I find especially useful are:    Each book of the Bible begins with an introduction that is started on a new page. That leaves many blank pages for adding my own notes and materials.  The outline that is presented in the introduction is followed within the notes section.  Maps necessary to gaining an understanding of the locale of an event are presented right on the page--eliminating the need to turn to the back of the Bible.  Controversial topics are presented in an acceptable manner without condescension nor attack. Conclusions of the author are given with a reasonable basis.   From the first page to the last, the Bible lies flat without having to press the pages down.  It is printed on fine bible paper and I've found no bleed through from highlighting nor notes. More than 95 evangelical conservative scholars contributed to the notes and articles contained within the ESV Study Bible. After only a week of use, I am becoming quite comfortable with the ESV translation. It is readable, and I've found no conflict with previously understood passages the way I have with other modern translations. I would make one recommendation to the publication of this study Bible. The numerous articles could be published as a separately bound volume. The two could still be sold as a unit, which may add to the cost; but it would make the book somewhat thinner. The articles, as good as they are, are not something that many people will reference continually during their study. I'm not sure that I will be comfortable carrying the hard-bound edition with me to church or into the pulpit. Since I cannot afford a leather-bound edition at this time, I'm not exactly sure what I am going to do. However, it seems fairly certain that the ESV translation and the study edition will be my Bible of choice for a while.
0956010903|5.0|I bought this for my wife who is a HUGE Harry Potter fan.  Honestly, I didn't think it was worth $100.  However, my wife wanted it so it was a Christmas present.  Now that they're sold out and the used ones have doubled in price, I'm glad I bought one!
0385751060|5.0|in a sentence: meet a boy named Bruno and discover the unfamiliar and confusing adventure that awaits him.<br /><br />i'll be honest - the number one thing that interested me about this book was that the inside cover. they thought it would spoil the reading of the book to give anything away and beleived it was important to start to read without knowing what is it about. having read it, i totally agree with that sentiment and will try and do my best to review without spoiling! though there is a movie version already, so you may already know.<br /><br />Bruno and his family live in Berlin, and is pretty happy with his life actually. he's a typical 9 year old boy with a typical bratty older sister (she's 12, practically a teenager) and doting house servants. he loves adventures and exploring and all the fun discoveries that come with that sort of thing. something happens that leads his family to move away from his home and he is not pleased about that.<br /><br />i absolutely adored Bruno's voice in this book. that's not to say that he was the narrator, because he wasn't really. it is his voice that is heard mostly in the book and his phrasing and everything, but we also get a peek into the thoughts of others through his eyes and through general narration. i'm not explaining it very well, but i really did like the way that Boyne did that.<br /><br />Bruno experiences the changes and new experiences through his 9 year old eyes, and so do we. it is with this naivety and simple acceptance that we learn what is going on in the story. there are some internal struggles, some serious questions and curiosity - but he is only 9 after all and who cares about what a 9 year old wants to know? so mostly Bruno discovers things for himself and does his best to make sense of them, and what he can't make sense of, he shrugs away.<br /><br />this was absolutely one of the best pieces of literature i have ever written. not purely because of the subject matter, but because of how it was written. i am seriously impressed with using a 9 year old as a narrator successfully and in a way that brought me to that level of naivety without any hint of condescension. even the chapter titles were 9-year-old-yet-adult-geared without being condescending. it was just incredible, and if you haven't read this yet - do it! you'll thank me.<br /><br />fave (non-spoiler) quote: \\"One afternoon, when Bruno came home from school, he was surprised to find Maria, the family maid - who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet - standing in his bedroom, pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates, even the things he'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's business.\\" (opening paragraph and it totally sucked me in / set the tone for the book).<br /><br />fix er up: a tad predictable, but that didn't hurt the overall impact and beauty of the writing.ing a 9 year old as a narrator successfully and in a way that brought me to that level of naivety without any hint of condescension. even the chapter titles were 9-year-old-yet-adult-geared without being condescending. it was just incredible, and if you haven't read this yet - do it! you'll thank me.    fave (non-spoiler) quote: \\"One afternoon, when Bruno came home from school, he was surprised to find Maria, the family maid - who always kept her head bowed and never looked up from the carpet - standing in his bedroom, pulling all his belongings out of the wardrobe and packing them in four large wooden crates, even the things he'd hidden at the back that belonged to him and were nobody else's business.\\" (opening paragraph and it totally sucked me in / set the tone for the book).    fix er up: a tad predictable, but that didn't hurt the overall impact and beauty of the writing.
0316017922|5.0|It seemed Gladwell was writing about many of my friends and family.  Although I believe that here is an author that is above average in writing ability and thinking ability, he writes so you can get the point he is making and still makes it very enjoyable.  I really loved this book.
0316286850|2.0|This book includes styles for both supermodels and average-looking people. However it was published more than a decade ago (copyright '97) and styles have changed since then. This is most notable in the use of \\"outlined\\" lips or super-dark lipstick on about 90% of the photos in the book. The \\"edgy\\" pictures are even more dramatic and outdated. All in all, an interesting book, but not very usable for makeup tips in '08.

B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Honestly, \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a very good movie.  It's dark, dramatic, full of rich themes, unexpected developments, and great performances.  Note my star rating.  It's not, however, the second coming.  Just to pull everyone back down to Earth a little, here are a few discussion points of the \\"not quite gushing with praise\\" variety:<br /><br />The movie is overstuffed and, plotwise, it's all over the map.  I'm convinced there were three or four hours worth of usable material when all was said and done and that director Christopher Nolan and his editors \\"found\\" the movie in the editing room, chipping away at the granite until they had a coherent movie.  And it IS coherent.  But I think the film would have flowed better and had more momentum if the final story was nailed down at the script stage instead.<br /><br />While previous \\"Batman\\" movies killed us with too much production design, to the point that a fantastic character like the Batman didn't even stand out against all the weird buildings and statues populating Gotham City, \\"The Dark Knight\\" went to the opposite extreme and, for the most part, just shot on ordinary streets in real cities (mostly Chicago).  I don't know, as much as I complained about the over-production in the previous movies, using nothing but ordinary, pre-exisitng locales this time out came off as sort of low-budget looking to me.  For the record, I think the previous movie, \\"Batman Begins\\" was the most successful Bat-film in striking the right balance between moody constructed sets and location shooting done on real streets.<br /><br />Moving onto the Two-Disc Special Edition, two things underwhelmed. For one thing, the picture quality was only okay.  Perfectly acceptable, but only that.  Where was the sharpness and the detail?  It was almost bad enough for me to believe the conspiracy theorists who are saying that Warner Brothers wanted to subtly push everyone toward buying the pricier Blu-Ray disc by not working too hard to make the standard DVD edition look all that great.  Secondly, where are all the great special features?  You get a few items of interest, but ultimately things are pretty sparse for a two-disc set.  I guess the extra digital copy of the movie for your computer didn't impress me much.<br /><br />So, those are my qualms.  I like the movie a lot, but I think you'll enjoy it more if you lower your expectations a little (that last comment goes out to the four people who haven't yet seen the movie in theaters and will be catching it for the first time on disc).  And the Two-Disc Special Edition probably isn't worth the extra expense; just get the single-disc edition and save a few dollars.<br /><br />When all is said and done, see \\"The Dark Knight\\" for Heath Ledger, a few good set pieces, the brooding music, and a couple unexpected shocks.  And, in the end, I guess that's enough.that great.  Secondly, where are all the great special features?  You get a few items of interest, but ultimately things are pretty sparse for a two-disc set.

B000BLI4PG|5.0|If you loved the movie, then you will love the CD.  It is a well constructed assortment of music that makes you relive the movie through audio. When I make long trips, I turn the CD on, and it's almost like watching the Warriors. A must for fans of the cult classic.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is just a great DVD for the family. Great photography, sound and narration that takes you all over the globe to remote places.  My daughter asks to watch it every night since we got it (the day after Christmas unfortunately). Don't be afraid to buy it from one of the resellers that repackage good dvds in original packaging.  You'll save a lot and enjoy it just as much!
0316143472|3.0|I really love him way too much for my own good. So I was so excited to pick up his latest book, and I truly was giggling through the first three chapters. He is just so crazy funny to me. I know that not everyone gets his humor, but I do. And I love it. He makes me want to download it and listen to him read it to me, because it's even more funny to hear him say what he's written. But as I got further through the book, it started to feel a bit forced, like he might be running out of material. Although, in some ways, he did feel more real in this book. There was more personal reflection than in his previous works, and I did like that. All in all, a mixed review (although I still will pick up anything and everything he writes). If you're a fan, read it. If you're a Sedaris first-timer, pick up Me Talk Pretty One Day and/or Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim (and Holidays on Ice) first, and then come back to this one.
0307269752|4.0|The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is one of the most purely enjoyable books I've read in a long time, and I am eagerly awaiting the release of the sequel (which I will probably buy as a UK import rather than wait an extra seven months). The story itself is captivating, and once it ramps up, you'll have a hard time putting the book down. That said, it does take a while for things to heat up -- you'll have to be patient through the first few dozen pages. More disappointingly, the heart of the story wraps up while there's still a lot of book left: there are a lot of loose ends that are wrapped up, while others are left on the table for Book 2. The end of the book is thus very anticlimactic (to put it mildly).<br /><br />I'd also like to say something about the values expressed in the book. There have been some complaints about the extreme violence contained herein, but as the original Swedish title for the book is Men Who Hate Women, that should be expected. The violence is in no way glorified. What is somewhat glorified (or at least not condemned) is the peculiar sexual mores of Scandinavia: the protagonist is having an ongoing affair with his partner/boss (who is married -- and her husband doesn't mind), while hopping off to have a \\"regular lover\\" in a 50-year-old woman, followed by a fling with a 25-year-old, etc. It appears that the author doesn't take these issues seriously, although the end of the book hints otherwise. Also, the author was a member of the Communist Party in Sweden, and once knowing this, some biases within the framework of the story are particularly clear. Then again, one of the ugliest aspects of the book, to me, was a throwaway pro-nationalism, anti-free trade remark toward the book's end, which doesn't particularly jive with internationalist communism. Regardless, neither the sexual values nor the political views of the author in any way detract from the superb story. I also feel like I got a bit of insight into Swedish culture, which was a bonus.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I was not sure how I would feel about some of the music that is included on the soundtrack, some of it seemed a little to \\"now\\" for me. The first time I saw the movie I only really liked a couple of songs. However, as I have listened to it I have come to love all of the songs.  I have listened to mine over and over now and can't get enough. Any Twilight fan will love the music, no matter how old they may be!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Warning!!! Before I say anything, let me say this: This specific Blu-ray DVD is NOT the same as the one shown on the Discovery channel. The show itself is exactly the same, BUT it has a different narrator. This one is narrated by David Attenborough, the one shown on Discover is narrated by Sigourney Weaver. I got this as a Christmas present and when I played it an old decrepid voice came across the screen, needless to say I was kind of dissapointed that a fairly more attractive voice was nowhere to be found. So just be sure you know which one you are buying.    The series itself is absolutely breathtaking. I've never seen anything like this before and I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys watching anything on TV. The visuals are stunning, the animals are surprising, and the details are unreproachable. I could watch this over and over again and never become bored with it. You must buy this series, I implore you!
0545128285|3.0|For true diehard fans. There's JK Rowling's wit, insights into her Harry Potter books (narrated throughout by Dumbledore, and her own footnotes), nice little tie-ins from the series, plus proceeds from the book go to charity. However, it was less (and more) than what I was expecting. Less in the way of heft - not too much substance - and more in that it was a little too graphic and deep for my son, who really is a diehard fan. It went right over his head (I stopped reading at one point because he just wasn't getting the humor or the lessons). There was also one disturbing \\"tale\\" that I didn't read to him because it was too graphic - it kind of made me cringe.    All in all, a fun book for the collection, but unless you're a real fan, probably not recommended.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I had heard several songs from this CD before purchasing it and loved them.  After hearing the rest of the CD, I now greatly enjoy listening to all of them.  It is a quality CD from a very talented musician and I couldn't be more pleased with it!

0316066524|1.0|[[ASIN:0316066524 Infinite Jest]]  Save yourself the trouble, do not buy, borrow, or worst of all, attempt to read this book.  It is a rambling, prolix, repetitive outpouring of techno-babble, with an invented universe of characters of no interest, sentences too long to unravel (even the author seems to forget to match subject with far-distant predicate on occasions), and an invisible plot.  I borrowed the book, determined with my characteristic tenacity to wade through at least the first 100 of its almost 1000 pages.  I made it to page 103, by which time no character held any interest, the story (if there was one) had eluded me, and I found my eyelids dropping at the very thought of opening it to read a few more tortuous pages.  I am fortified by the knowledge that Time Magazine disagrees with me, citing it as one of the best 100 novels written since 1923.  And this from the magazine that supported US policy in Vietnam.  If you want to find out about drugs, buy the Pharmocopeia, or read William Burroughs.  If you want to read about tennis, buy McEnroe's autobiography. If you want to spend a dozen hours trying to unravel a discontinuous narrative full of unconnected arcane technicalities, attempt to read Infinite Jest.
159102594X|4.0|As the author's first published work, it gets stronger as it goes along and by the end leaves the reader fully committed to the series.  After I submit this review I plan to order the other two books in the series.  As a stand alone I would give this book a 3, but by the end it was a 4 and I am optimistic the next two in the series will carry the momentum this one ended with.
0375842209|5.0|Go ahead, don't look at the thickness, read this book and read it again and then pass it on to your daughters and sons and mother and father and brothers and sisters and friends and whomever. Its a great book for all; young adults, middle adults and old adults.

It is shaping up to be easily my favourite since MCMXII...     Je T'aime till my dying day and Deja Vu are my current stand out faves.    An absolute must by for all Enigma fans.

B001GQACGO|2.0|First off, I love Beyonce. My little cousin received two of these CDs as a Christmas gift so I gladly took it off her hands. Last night I just put the CD in and let it rip. I was first shocked but excited there were two CDs. My first thought was they songs must be long since there was only a handful of songs on each. When I put the first CD in after the fourth songs, I was like, blah, but I still got excited about the second CD because of the content on the first CD, I was thinking that the next one is going to be the \\"SASHA fierce\\" side. Outside of the \\"Single Ladies\\" single on the radio, the other songs were just okay. I was so disppointed. One more thing, I couldnt believe Beyonce downgraded the word \\"DIVA\\" to a female hustler, what was she or her people thinking.

B00005JPSM|2.0|If you need any more explanation than what others have said before me, let me be plain... this movie leaves you feeling depressed. Even when it gives you a happy ending, whoops I've blown it for you... 90% of a depressing film with a 10% happy ending is ummm, what is that? A depressing film!    The cast is likable enough, you will forgive them only perhaps because you have seen them in other films which you liked. This is one of those films you have to ask yourself, why did these actors agree to make it?     It had no chance of being a blockbuster, or even an indie sleeper, and if this was made out of love, well then that love seems to be for the German original \\"Mostly Martha\\". Why not just refund everyone and buy a big billboard in every major city that says, go see the original.    1 star for the movie, another star for Abigail Breslin who is worth watching even in a crappy \\"romantic comedy\\" masquerading as a fun date movie. Yes by all means bring someone to this movie, that is if you plan on breaking up with them! But wait, what was the worst part of this film? No it wasn't the actors, or the plot, it was the food. This is a food movie that doesn't even leave you feeling hungry in the end.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|Prior to pregnancy, I worked out quite a bit--but I'm no athlete.  I was nervous about buying a video because I didn't want anything too easy or too hard.  This video fits the bill.  It's long enough (40 minutes) that I don't feel like I'm cheating on excercise.  It's tough enough that I definitely break a sweat.  I like that there are different sections: warm up, standing work, floor work, stretching.  I read other reviews complaining about the background music and the scenery, but it doesn't bother me--I'll only be pregnant another 6 months, then I can go back to a different workout.  Overall, I love this video, and agree with the other people that gave it 5 stars.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Great movie! Nice edition

B000053VAZ|5.0|I love this movie! The deleted scenes are okay. I would have liked them better if the director wasn't talking about them as they played, but oh well. I'm not too bummed about that. Definitely a feel good movie. I haven't heard the commentary yet, but I will be watching it.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|I can sum up this movie in 5 words, what was the director thinking? What really made this movie unbearable and just absolutly ridiculous was the the script! The mysterious crystal skull plot from the begining I felt was stupid, from the moment I saw it in the theater. And the way it lead to Aliens was just plain si-fi foolishness. I don't want to make too big a deal over it, but that's not the traditional Indiana Jones theme. I'm sure if you all remember they were no other wordly creatures in any of the movies. This was one was a real mockery of Indiana Jones. I have no desire to buy it, really, and I don't think the traditional Indiana fans would either.

0307277887|4.0|I first met Dexter on the Showtime series and was thrilled to find out the story is adapated from a series of books. The first book follows the television series for the most part, with some parts added for dramatization.  The book is a quick read and simple. It's perfectly filled with excitement and intrigue to keep you occupied on a lazy rainy weekend.     If you are a fan of the television series, be prepared for some changes.  The book is more realistic than the show.
B000W9DTG6|5.0|I had bought Ocean's 11 already, but this deal was too good to pass by. One of the best things about these DVD's is that they do not have any annoying previews for other movies beforehand.   Great buy for this trio!
B0000025DD|5.0|I almost gave this 4* and was going to say I almost gave it 5*.  But you know, I'm going to do the reverse, even though I think people over-rate most music in Amazon.  All those really average neo-Prog bands getting 5*...just sad.    But you know, I'm a huge guitar music fan.  I play guitar. I also have 4000 CDs/LPs, and of everyone Gilmore is my favorite guitarist.  His fluid lines.  Sense of melody. And virtuosity (no he's no Fripp, but I prefer his style and sound).      I have all the Floyd albums (including More, Clouds, etc) and all the Gilmore and Waters solo albums.  I think each man is amazing.  Waters as a songwriter and his lyrics, and Gilmore as a singer and guitarist.  And at the end of the day, as good as Gilmore's three solo albums are, this one is my favorite.  If you're a fan of the wonderful lines he plays throughout Wish You Were Here, you'll love this album.  And for that, plus the surprisingly strong songwriting, I give this album 5*.
0545128285|5.0|My husband and I (both fans of the series) really enjoyed this book. The stories are clever, well written, entertaining and give a bit of insight into the wizarding world. I also liked that Rowling did her own illustrations, which aren't bad.    I really can't imagine why any HP fan wouldn't enjoy The Tales of Beedle the Bard - they're everything they're supposed to be!
B00011F5DK|5.0|I ordered this game after reading all the positive reviews and seeing all the awards that it had won.  It lives up to the hype.  It is a quick game to play and it is very fun for both kids and adults.  I recommend this for ages 8-10 and up.  It's also one of those games which doesn't get old very fast as we have been playing it regularly and still enjoy it.  It requires some thought, but isn't hard to play.  Every family should own this game!
0375826726|2.0|Let me just start with: a 22 page description of forging a sword!! 22 pages!!??? I love swords, I am interested in forging but this for a fantasy novel is ridiculous, self-indulgent and obviously padding lifted from others knowledge which thankfully the writer does acknowledge. This book is too plodding and drawn out and seems designed to ensure that the trilogy would have to be four books or more. Eragon struggles with the violence of his role as a rider but the book itself is strangely grisly and violent in a way I feel the others were not and is gratuitous and i don't generally have a problem with violence in its place in a story. Sometimes it felt like Roran was the main protagonist and not Eragon and he came across as more compelling and likable I think.    In sum, this book seems a bit meandering and directionless and could have done with a more cruel editing and refinement and sadly became a boring and glaze-over-let-me-get-to-the-good-parts read.    I hope the 'last' book is more controlled and to the point with less obvious plot set-ups that pepper this work- huge sign-posts have been set-up to make us be specifically aware without subtlety of certain characters' importance in the future- these signposts were written as obvious devices rather than as part of the flow of the tale and lack the finesse of the earlier works.  I am hopeful that the author will reel all of this in for the final book!
B0018AK9RA|4.0|There's a lot of people that do not like this album simply because it doesn't sound like old Priest. To start, this is a stupid way to listen to music. If you don't like a band changing their sound, go buy the first albums of every rock and metal band there is, listen, then find a way remove your hearing permanently.    Of course there are also many people out there that love this album just because it is Judas Priest. Sigh.....     Anyways, the point is this album is an amazing piece of work, but it's really going to depend on whether you like Progressive Metal as opposed to Metal. This is definately not old Priest, but it is something they have wanted to do for a while. If you like Progressive Metal, you are probably going to love this. If not, you are probably going to hate it.    From my opinion, this is a good four and a half album (from someone who loves Progressive Metal). This album is exactly what it should be. There are some slow parts in the album that feel like they drag along a bit. The rest of this album is great. The album gets a -.5 for not being as good as Tobias Sammet's Avantasia.    Don't listen to fools. Don't listen to me either. Progressive Metal is a different sound for most in the US. Figure it out yourself whether you like it.    P.S. The subject title is legal. Halford sang it at least twice.
0689865384|2.0|ok. well, this book is not that bad but its not super OMG good either. i mean it has a good idea and interesting plot but the style is just boring.. i have to read this becuz im in the reaidng bowl and i literally have to forced myself to read it...  i hate it because there's so much descriptions and jsut not the poetic or precise ones, just randomness. blabalabla. the part when tally followed shay's clues to get to the smokies was confusing and too much so i jsu skipped it..  and the ending about the escape was too easy and i hate it how david forgive tally so easily -wheres the tragedy????
0743290119|1.0|Lauren Wiesberger, go away. Stop writing books. Please. CHASING HARRY WINSTON is hands down one of the worst books I have ever had the misfortune of reading. The first 50 pages are decent. (Not great, but decent. Mindless. But entertaining.) But then page 51 rolled around and then it was like L.W. just squatted over the paper and took a big #2, smeared it around for, like, 200 more pages, then published it. I'm not kidding you, folks, this book is bad. So bad. Basically because nothing happens! NOTHING! These three annoying girls (who aren't very likable to begin with) just run around literally doing nothing (making them even less likable then they were to begin with, which wasn't very likable) for 200-some pages before nothing happens again and the book FINALLY ends. I just don't understand why Lauren Weisberger felt the need to write all this down. Or why her publisher felt the need to mass produce it. Or why I bought it. IN HARDCOVER! Everything about this situation is wrong. I want my money back! But, more importantly, I want the hours I wasted reading this book back! BARF! This book is like BARF! I'm not kidding you DON'T BOTHER! NOT EVEN IN PAPERBACK! DON'T DO IT!
B00027LCRG|5.0|This is a review of the music on the bonus CD. Visit my page to view my review of the original album if interested.<br /><br />Since these songs are a collection of remixes and rarities, I wouldn't recommend popping this disk in and sitting through the whole thing front to back. Although I quite enjoyed doing so for this review, I normally don't like hearing the same song over and over in different forms.<br /><br />The physical package itself (a first-class booklet with CD sheaths inside the bookends) is one of Bowie's most colorful and visually impressive. I have both this album and the 3-D jewel case version b/c they're so cool. And I got it cheap at Tower Record's going-out-of-business sale (somewhere near San Francisco).<br /><br />1) \\"Thursday's Child (Rock Mix)\\" (4:27) - an excellent mix not terribly different from the album version, it features a surprise background-vocal bridge and could've just as easily made the final cut. *****<br /><br />2) \\"Thursday's Child (Omikron: The Nomad Soul Slower Version)\\" (5:32) -  the first of three lushly enhanced remixes from Omikron. *****<br /><br />3) \\"Something In The Air (American Psycho Remix)\\" (6:01) - Full of ornate piano flourishes, this is a cool remix. Distortions which appear on the album are removed from Bowie's vocals, revealing the clearly enunciated lyrics underneath. I actually loved this song in its place at the closing credits of American Psycho.  *****<br /><br />4) \\"Survive (Marius De Vries Mix)\\" (4:18) - Flushed out with a woozy trip-hop feel and elaborate musical details, this version has a distinctly different feel from the album cut. *****<br /><br />5) \\"Seven (demo version)\\" (4:05) - This is a demo? It's so well executed and produced, no one would've complained if it was used for the album. The only thing that suggests 'demo' is the church organ laying down basic chords. It was probably the basic template that most of the remixers had to work with. ****1/2<br /><br />6) \\"Seven (Marius De Vries Mix)\\" (4:12) - like De Vries' remix of \\"Survive,\\" this track has a distinctly different feel and attitude. The orchestrated sonic touches are nice. ****1/2<br /><br />7) \\"Seven (Beck Mix #1)\\" (3:44) - Beck adds a tasty hip-hop beat with distinctly 80's percussion sounds. Wiggy! *****<br /><br />8) \\"Seven (Beck Mix #2)\\" (5:11) - extremely wigged-out sonic adventurism on this one. It's overkill, but I'm a big sucker for this kind of freak session, especially with Beck at the wheel. *****<br /><br />9) \\"The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell (edit)\\" - 3:59 minutes and hot. ****1/2<br /><br />10) \\"The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell (Stigmata Film Version)\\" (4:46) - a spacier take with only superficial differences from the main version. ****1/2<br /><br />11) \\"The Pretty Things Are Going To Hell (Stigmata Film Only Version)\\" (3:58) - enjoyable but pretty straightforward techno version. ***1/2<br /><br />12) \\"New Angels Of Promise (Omikron: The Nomads Of Soul Version)\\" (4:37) - blows me away all over again - \\"I am a blind man, she is my eyes\\" - actually the whole song represents some of his best lyrics. In fact, gets my vote for one of his best songs ever. This version is basically an enhancement of an already killer cut. *****<br /><br />13) \\"The Dreamers (Omikron: The Nomad Soul Longer Version)\\" (5:39) - same deal with this remix: slightly different but not necessarily better or worse. Actually, it sounds a little too smoothed over. ***1/2<br /><br />14) \\"1917\\" - a virtual instrumental, there are a few Bowie vocals which are so heavily distorted it's hard to understand the words. It sounds like he's singing \\"I'm the man.\\" Nothing about the track makes me think of 1917 and it certainly sounds too modern for that year as well, but it could be put to good use in an action or science fiction movie. Has a cool fake ending in the middle. ****<br /><br />15) \\"We Shall Go To Town\\" - a meandering, moody piece with fantastic, metallic-sounding guitar from Reeves Gabrels. ****1/2<br /><br />16) \\"We All Go Through\\" - a dreamy, high-flying pop song, full of lush instrumentation, soaring choruses, ringing electric guitar strums and spacey effects. *****<br /><br />17) \\"No-one Calls\\" - a strangely sung, slightly Middle-Eastern tinged track featuring more sparkling electronic sounds. ****<br /><br />Most people would probably feel these last four tracks have been appropriately relegated to B-side status, and I would agree . . . I love the experimental freedom found on great B-sides and they provide a great opportunity for artists to try things off the beaten path. This is a most worthy collection, especially if you're a die-hard Bowie fan.tric guitar strums and spacey effects. *****     17) \\"No-one Calls\\" - a strangely sung, slightly Middle-Eastern tinged track featuring more sparkling electronic sounds. ****     Most people would probably feel these last four tracks have been appropriately relegated to B-side status, and I would agree . . .

B001CD6FKI|3.0|I was pretty disappointed in this film.  I thought it would've been a lot better.  I bought it because Emile Hirsch is one of my favorite actors, (See \\"Into the Wild\\" if you haven't seen it yet!)  I found the movie to be quite boring and I really found it difficult to watch the whole thing.  The acting was average and so was the story.  I give it a C.  I think younger people under 15 would enjoy this movie more than older people.  Quite disappointing.
0618918248|3.0|'The God Delusion' is an interesting, sometimes fun, occasionally irritating, and mostly antagonistic writing.  As a practicing biologist, I find myself reading and reviewing from within the framework of evolutionary theory.  But from the concern that this could be too myopic, I consider the likes of Vine Deloria Jr.'s \\"Evolution, Creationism and other Modern Myths\\" to be a worthy companion and recommend this to other readers.     I found 'Delusion' to be somewhat scattered at times in what it was either attacking or supporting. Sometimes it was sticking to 'God', but often drifting to religion at large without re-defining the breadth of this term.  More accurate clarification of definitions and sticking within these confines would have helped Dawkin's arguments.    The focus in one of the chapters on Adolf Hitler's Catholicism as potentially motivating his efforts was, to me, not as convincing as psychobiographical literature that present an alternative hypothesis.  The Swiss psychoanalyst Alice Miller and the psychobiographer Lloyd DeMause, to name just two, have written on the psychology of abuse in childhood and how it impacted the adult lives of many murderous dictators, including Hitler.      In fact, in comparing religion per se versus past child abuse and neglect (a strict and oppressive religious up-bringing can constitute child abuse) as a source of violent motivations in individuals or groups, I would wager that sustained abuse during childhood is more than just the spark that sets individuals down the road to violence. Detrimentally, some religions both promote and exploit the fear that becomes integrated into the child mind which can subsequently be fanned during adolescence and adulthood into the flames of interpopulation conflict. As any psychologist will tell you, these are not motivations which readily can be \\"argued away\\" using reason. It would be quite interesting were Dawkins to immerse himself in works following the psychobiological lineage initiated by Ian D. Suttie (\\"The Origins of Love and Hate\\") and developed into attachment theory by John Bowlby (the Attachment Trilogy books) and colleagues before addressing this topic anew.    Thoughtful writings that address not only the religious roots of violence to other humans but also to the planet in general that may be of interest to other readers are Paul Shepard's \\"Nature and Madness\\" and David Abram's \\"The Spell of the Sensuous\\".
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I pre-ordered the dvd because of suggestions from friends of mine.  The acting is really good and so is the plot.  Angelina is gorgeous in this movie, you won't be disappointed.  I really enjoyed it.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a outstanding set of CDs with extraordinary imagery. The diaries are what make the films very personal and emotive. They connects the viewer intimately with the importance of each subject matter. The challenges that the photographers overcame while filming were extreme adding to the weighiness of the viewing experience.
B001N44BVQ|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and I had to pre-order the dvd.  Nobody that enjoys movies will be disappointed by this film.  Leo is at his best, and so is Russell Crowe.  This is not another cheesy post 9/11 garbage movie like Rendition.  This movie has a great plot and great acting.  A must see!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I was very pleased to receive it before the expected time (you have predicted 30th of December but it came on the 22 into my hands:). Excellent quality, fun package (unfolds in 3 ways). Thank you very much? i was actually my first order through the internet ever, and i was very excited to receive it. :)
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This movie is by far the funniest movie of the year.  I don't have a negative thing to say about this movie.  It is a comedy that really makes fun of hollywood celebrities.  I pre-ordered the dvd, and I could watch it all the time.  A must see!
B001B9N6LO|4.0|This was a huge hit with my 3-year old for Christmas. I looked at several parking garages. I knew I wanted a wooden one, so this seemed to be the  be best option. The fact that it a \\"green\\" product also makes it very attractive to me. One other aspect that is a huge bonus for us is that it fits with Brio train products. We have connect roads and train tracks to it, which makes it truly universal. My son has played hours with it since Christmas Day. One complaint. This was also purchased to accommodate his collection of matchbox/hotwheel-type cars. These kinds of cars will NOT fit in the elevator. This was a little frustrating for us and him, but we have found ways to work around that. Also the ramps come off a little too easy, but my son seems to like to remove them anyway.  Assembly was easy, and it seems to be a very strong product. I definitely recommend it to anyone.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|I just cannot say enough about how awesome this CD from Keane is.  I equally enjoy each and every song on this album, something that I can not say for any other album.  A perfect mix of sad and uplifting songs, and I'm having a very hard time listening to anything else right now with these songs in my head.  One of the best CD's ever, and if you have never listened to Keane, I would start with this album and then move on to their others.  I would give it 10 stars if I could!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|Watched it with my wife and the in-laws. I liked it and thought it was well done and funny. I am not a big Ben Stiller fan and I still managed to enjoy it. Tom Cruise's character stole the show and Downey Jr. was also excellent. My wife also liked the movie while my Father-in-law thought it was just OK. Mother-in-law hated it. I give it five stars relative to what it is, a cheesy comedy that doesn't take itself to seriously.
B000TX7B5U|5.0|This is one of the greatest milestones in music that has ever been made. All of the songs are wonderful and inspiring. The lyrics really make you think about life and morales. I love that you can derive your own meaning from every song and have many moral and philosophical conversations about all of them. Serj is such a talented person, he played every instrument on the album and was capable of using his voice as an instrument. No pop star can do that. I highly recommend this album for any person who enjoys music.
B001KVZ69I|5.0|I saw this in the theatre yesterday. It is very well made and the casting was excellent.<br /><br />Having read the book I felt they left out some key elements that add to the story development. I guess that is always the case with book then movie. I have a very vivid imagination and the movie in my head had so many more details that left a lasting impression than the movie did.<br /><br />I had pictured Bruno the Nazi officers son just about as he is but not so skinny. There is a reference in the book about him being bigger than the POW Jewish boy. actually it was the other way around in the movie.<br /><br />It was made very excellent and the outcome of the story is the same. How it all happens is just a bit different. If possible I'd suggest see the movie first then read the book..that way it will add details and you will not be frustrated that key points are left out that really matter in the development of the Bruno character.<br /><br />Bruno is so very innocent of what is going on in the camps. It does make you think that the childen of these Nazi officers are not to blame. Some where forced to be Hitler Youth but not the case for Bruno. He was a typical 8 year old boy who was just innocent and had been protected.<br /><br />What really helps in the movie is to see the reactions of the Officers wife. Her expressions and reactions to learning what was really going on in the camps her husband was in charge of. She was so horrified.<br /><br />So if you have the chance this story is a must either by film or book. If you do both again I suggest the movie then the book. It is very SAD and Tragic which ever one you choose.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Gandhi is an excellent film that any person will enjoy. I could write about it for pages, but for convenience, I shall keep this review short. This film will really make you think about life and war. You will not ever regret purchasing this great film. Very powerful, moving, and inspirational to any person with a soul. I highly recommend this wonderful film to everybody.    Peace.
0679745653|5.0|ive read a few of the bad reviews out of curiosity, and let me start off with the simplest, it wouldnt have chapter's becasue its not a novel, its a short story! as well as the other 3.(house of flower/diamond guitar/christmas story) and secondly, if your a teenager, the ususal placid moronic kind you wouldnt see a point.And men with egos probably wouldnt get it either.<br /><br />  I being a 25 year old girl was wistful about the book. its not a feel good read but an important one none the less. I for one can relate to holiday golightly, sometimes when life is rough you have to go on. theres a great british quote, familiarized during the blitz on london\\"keep calm, and cary on\\"- well thats holly. And yes its not hugely different from the movie, there really alot of humor and wit, but its much more melancoly. Its not sugary sweet. And most of capotes work is told from his personal view. I imagine he knew a ms.golightly of some kind- and its not a love/love romance. he even says \\"loved her, as one loves there grandmother, or the postmad that let me tag along his route, even a whole family named(cant recall the name)\\"- its one of the best things ive read, if you like catcher in the rye youd like this. Capote was amazing
B000H7JD4A|4.0|Maiden has done better albums, but this is still wonderful, especially compared to some of the other music being sold now. The Longest Day is a song that is so intense, it will give you an adrenaline rush. For The Greater Good Of God is a wonderful song along with The Legacy. Maiden has changed their style from some of their earlier albums, but the new style is just as good, just different.If this is your first maiden album, I would not recommend it. Start with some of their earlier work and see if you like them. As for hardcore Maiden fans. This is a great album and I highly recommend it.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|I became a quick Taylor Swift fan after hearing \\"Tim McGraw\\" on her first cd. This cd didn't let me down. A lot of the songs are geared more to a teenage audience, but it is still a great cd. My 13 year old loves \\"Fifteen\\", and i hope that she learns from the mistakes that the girl in the song made, and doesn't make them herself. \\"Best Day\\" always makes me smile, and \\"Fearless\\" is how I hope my children go thru life. This is a great cd and can be enjoyed by all ages.
0440241030|2.0|Well, Jack's still cool, but the Reacher plots continue to sink deeper down the septic tank. What is there to take away from this plot? Thing 1: Lee Child loves being a \\"New Yorker\\" (expat fake that he is), so get ready to learn the names or numbers of every street on the swanky Lower West Side (which today is inundated with blue-blood European neo-colonizers). Thing 2: U.S. supported elite ex-military mercenary guys (think \\"Blackwater\\") are behind most of the violence that goes on in really violent places like Africa and the Middle East. Thing 3: Reacher never changes his clothes, rarely showers, goes around covered in blood, guts, and gore, and no one seems to care or even notice... especially sophisticated women who love the fact that the only clean thing about him are his teeth (though he never seems to have toothpaste). Thing 4: Reacher never works-out but somehow gets stronger and more massive with age. Breaking someone's wrist is as easy as snapping a match for old man Reacher.  Summary: I still like Reacher in spite of himself, and will keep reading the series, but do hope that Child comes up with some better material for Reacher to work with.

B000BBRDBW|5.0|This CD features other artists that compliment Vollenweider's style.  Very nice assembly of middle eastern music that is great for listening or if you're into belly dancing, for dancing to.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I am so glad I took the time to view this series. Let's face it, you only go through this life once, and it's impossible to see all of the beauty this planet has to offer; mostly due to the fact that it is so unaccessable to the novice. But the crew of \\"Blue Planet\\" takes you to the roof top of the world and then plunges you back into it's oceans.It was like taking a vacation around the world while sitting in my living room. But,do be prepared for natures harsher side. You will see some scenes that are not for the faint of heart, but i think the editing was just right...they cut away from the scenes before it becomes too repugnant.I plan on giving this as a gift to my Mom on Mother's Day.
B001ACH4DS|1.0|I was hoping for a great album from a great artist, not quite. This is a very boring album and each song sounds the same. It's like 1 hour track, that will put you to sleep.
B001ILHY1I|3.0|Well, you have the very sexy Jason Statham tried and wrongfully convicted for the murder of his wife. Of course he isn't guilty, but why someone killed his wife soon becomes apparent when he is asked to race, in prison, as the recently deceased driver (AKA Frankenstein). The Death Races, created, produced and organized by the warden are immensely popular to internet fans, and the person to win the most gains his freedom (ok, a tad unrealistic, but this is a movie).  Anyway, although the plot is rather thin, there are several things to LOVE about this film. There is the incredibly sexy Statham (ok, I know that I have said that several times), a crooked warden and her evil sidekick, a very pretty/sexy woman who rides shotgun with Statham, a funny mechanic, Tyrese (anyone riding with him manages to die), fast cars, explosions, and the general dose of death and destruction. So, would I give this movie an Oscar? No. But would I recommend it for someone looking for a few hours of mindless entertainment? Yes, absolutely.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a fantastic musical satire. If you missed it before, you really should get it now. It's worth the money.     Also, I was very pleased with how quickly my dvd arrived (along with the cd for my car). This seller got it out fast!     Thanks for the great service.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria was easily the best show ever made by MTV, yet sadly it looks as though it will never be released on DVD. I do hope that they eventually pull their heads out of the sand (or other places, ahem) and realize what a travesty this is, particularly when looking at the other shows (if you can call them that) MTV is churning out on DVD nowadays. If this show ever does get released, I'll definitely be among the first in line to buy all five seasons.
006085880X|2.0|The Jacket to this book really caught my attention, what could have happened to these young lovers that would make them want to kill themselves. The book starts off with a Bang but quickly looses its momentum. I find Chris to be a believable character until he helps Emily put the gun to her head, Emily in my opinion is not very believable, if the two of them were so close she would have confided in him about the baby. This book drug at times and was painful at others....I was happy when I was finished reading it.

B001GZ6QEC|4.0|Heath Ledger took this movie into territory that Christian Bale could not have alone.  This really is a very basic comic book adaptation made into a very serious social commentary by Ledger's performance as the Joker.  I found myself always waiting for the Joker and somewhat zoning out when he was not there.  Katie Holmes should have been retained as her replacement was very two dimensional and just did bring her role to life.  Sadly, the Joker may live on but his portray by the late Heath Ledger will not.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I love the movie so much that I watched it three times in the theatre!

B0017ANAZO|1.0|Diane English said she thought the original was \\"mean\\"...oh brother! Political Correctness is so damned boring. Why, oh why, do these Hollywood twits re-make Great Movies? Why don't they re-make lousy movies and try to make them better? I think it's just a lack of imagination. This 2008 version is to the 1939 version what warm Kool-Aid is to Champagne. Claire Booth Luce wrote a play, \\"THE WOMEN\\", which is sophisticated and razor-sharp funny. Joan Crawford's Crystal Allen alone would blow all these cutesy gooey girls off the screen. No comparison. If you like warm Kool-Aid, then by all means have the re-make. But, if you like wit and style, nothing can top \\"THE WOMEN\\" which has a stellar cast but also was directed by one of Hollywood's greats, GEORGE CUKOR.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Imagine if you will, an alternate universe in which Metallica went on hiatus after releasing ...And Justice for All.  Sure, they occasionally got together for special projects, such as S&M.  However, by and large, the guys went on to do solo projects, grow as musicians, and ceased to function as the band Metallica.  Then, they got back together to do Death Magnetic: this is the album they would have created.      This is a great, thrashy album that, in some ways, echoes Kill `em All more than any of their other work.  Gone is the painful bid for Top 40 popularity.  This album was recorded by a thrashin', hard-rockin', evolved and mature Metallica that is proud of its roots.  Fans of 90's-era Metallica might find this album too heavy; the rest of us are too busy flashing the horns and banging our heads to care.
0316035904|4.0|This book is very funny. I read it a few months ago and there was one story I was not very fond of, hence the 4 stars (instead of 5), but I totally recommend it for the other great stories.
1439102813|4.0|It's astounding to realize that this wonderful book is Lisa Genova's first, since it is so compelling, so well written, so un-put-downable.  Her subject is not easy, and by creating an Alice who is an accomplished, aware, and brilliant protagonist, it makes the effects of Alzheimer's even more frightening.  Each stage is illuminated, from the first inklings of the disease through the final obfuscation of all that made Alice Alice.  The marriage between her and John is depicted as loving and supportive, if not perfect.  Her experience with the ravages of the disease, despite intelligent precautions and more than average access to information, renders her condition even more alarming.  This is an extremely important book since it offers an understanding of what to expect should the reader be either a victim themselves, or have an afflicted loved one.
0060775858|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child and I would often ask my mom to read me it as a bedtime story at least once a week. Even now at the age of 22, I still have my old copy of the book. It's a timeless classic that will last through the ages!    Allison
B001ACH4DS|4.0|Hey look-the right person won last season's American Idol AND I love their debut CD. When was the last time that happened for me? Oh, right. Never.    The Tracks:    DECLARATION: Pretty much just Cook rocking out. Decent song but definitely not one of my favorites. 2 out of 5.    HEROES: Really love David's voice here. He hits all the right notes, upbeat and loud. 4 out of 5.     LIGHT ON: The reason I bought the CD. Catchy hook but w/ a raw edge. 5 out of 5    COME BACK TO ME: Just like \\"Light On\\" this strikes just the right balance between emotional depth and a solid hook. 4 out of 5.    LIFE ON THE MOON: Solid, fun, interesting lyrics. 4 out of 5.    BAR-BA-SOL: Tough w/o being over-the-top-pretentious. The guitarist wins but David comes in a close second. 4 out 5.    MR. SENSITIVE: Not my favorite, lyrics are a little \\"off\\" for me, comes across a little too self-aware for me as well. Still good-David's vocals are spot on. 3 out of 5.    LIE: Saved from being easily forgotten filler for me w/ the last line of the chorus \\"So look me in the eye...\\" w/ the lovely guitar playing runs in the background. 3 out of 5.    I DID IT FOR YOU: Lyrics are a little too kitchy for me but Cook's voice is all rough velvet sincerity as he recites them. Saved the song for me. 3 out of 5.    AVALANCHE: Sounds like a lot of other songs I like. Not original, but not bad. 3 out of 5.    PERMANENT: My least favorite but I loved the strings and piano in the background. 2 out of 5.    A DAILY ANTHEM: Feels a bit climactic to not be the end of the album. Would have made a great finish to me but what do I know? Guitar goes kind of crazy at the end, I kind of like it. 3 out of 5.    THE TIME OF MY LIFE:  It's not the WORST AI winner circle hit they've written. I actually kinda like it. It's probably because of David. Whatever. 3 out of 5.    Over all this album was solid (for me at least). I'll be watching for David Cook's next release if it's anything like this one. Well done!
031606792X|5.0|I have read all four books.  And think they are a facinating read, I was up all night finishing one book, as it was so captivating.  I am in the 35-40 age group and my daughter is now reading the books.  These will be a classic.  Awesome writng skills, story, and the movie just visualized exactly what I pictured in my mind.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My son requested this series for Christmas and I'm sooo glad he did!  We've watched two episodes and they are so amazing.  The films are beautiful, and show many things that I've never seen before, like a snow leopard hunting a mountain goat, pirhannas in action under water in the Amazon, and a Japanese salamander two meters long that lives in extremely cold water.  I can't believe the perseverance of the scientists and camera crews that could discover such wonders in far-flung parts of the earth and film them so skillfully...but I'm glad they did it!
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I have to say that I am totally and very happily surprised by this CD. I am an Enya fan, but when I saw this CD advertised I (mistakenly) took it to be a commercial Christmas album and I did not pay it any attention. However it was given to me as a Christmas present and this is the first day that I have listened to it. I advise anybody else not to write it off the way that I did. Although Christmas and Winter are the themes of the album, these are tracks that you could hear anytime, not just when you have the family around for Christmas drinks.    Every song here reaches the high standards that we expect from Enya. Instrumentation, vocals, arrangement, composition, rhythm, melody - all are outstanding. I will say however that if you do not like Enya then this will not be for you. She does not have a new sound to her, but continues in her usual style.    There are two traditional arrangements (both stunning) and ten new compositions. My favourites at the current time are \\"White is in the Winter night\\", \\"Dreams are more precious\\", \\"One toy soldier\\" and as many other people have said the quirky \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\". This should definitely be the next single. I say that these are my favourite tracks now but that could change tomorrow. They are all excellent.    In summary, I would highly recommend this album to anybody (in particular people like me - an Enya fan that was put off by the seemingly commercial theme of the album) except for people who adamantly do not like Enya's music.
0739304623|1.0|Lame plot, stale characters, and it takes over half the book for anything at all to happen.  So much of this book is useless filler, I can't believe it even got published.
B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I order and paid for the movie, I never got the movie. I did contact the seller, who said he sent out another movie,that I never got either. I then recontacted the seller who said he was going to give me my money back. I'm still waiting for my money back.
B001NA4CMI|5.0|Great package for an excellent movie! Received as a gift.  The movie is great and beyond any Batman movie, to date, but if you're into special features and behind-the-scenes documentaries along with a DVD case that's above-the-norm, then this edition comes highly recommended.
B0015519VS|2.0|Well, the entire cd was not that great, but the title track #17 \\"Here I Stand\\" is the most beautiful song I have heard Usher sing.  When I heard it on the radio, I was nearly brought to tears.  My sweetheart could have written every word.  He is in the military and has to travel quite a bit so he has spoken those same words to me.  To hear it in a song actually touched us both.  So I am satified to have the song to listen to over and over.  However, the whole cd was lacking.  Confessions was a much better complete effort.  This one seemed thrown together.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|If Clint Eastwood never makes another movie, Gran Torino will serve as the ideal swan song for an actor/director who has spent a career playing tough guys with tortured souls, and yes, tender hearts.<br /><br />Here Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, an aging Korean war vet still haunted by his past and simmering with rage and racism.  Alone now after the death of his wife,  Walt is alienated from his family and irritated by everything in his world, especially the Asian family that has moved in next door.<br /><br />In typical Eastwood style, he fearlessly confronts neighborhood bullies and gang members the way we imagine an aging Dirty Harry might.  For those of us who grew up watching Eastwood take care of bad guys, it's very satisfying to see the old master stick it to a new generation of punks.  And Eastwood is not above self-parody.  So when Walt aims a shotgun at a bully and snarls \\"Get off my lawn!\\" the audience has a good laugh.<br /><br />As events force Walt to deal with, and eventually protect the Asians next door, we watch as his tough and racist persona gradually thaws and he enters into tentative friendship with his neighbors.  This is another satisfying element of the film.  The scenes where Walt, in his gruffy crude way, ends up helping the young Asian boy next door, are especially warm and heartful.<br /><br />But beyond the rehabilitation of a bitter racist, Gran Torino is also a meditation on the limits of violence.  For all his toughness, Walt isn't able to keep the violence from escalating.  And it eventually forces him to come to terms with his violent past.<br /><br />The ending is unexpected and out of character, which is what makes it brilliant.  In the end, Walt heals his wounds and transcends his past.  And by making this film, so does Eastwood.  It will be a classic.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|A very funny movie.  I'm very glad I purchased it & would  highly recommend it.
B0009NCQJ6|4.0|This is a great cd for anyone who likes Irish/ Celtic music, instrumental music, or just plain good music. It is full of high-energy music, and has a dvd of a few music videos.
B000002MTR|5.0|This is an excellent CD, and I loved almost every track with favorites being \\"My Friend\\" and \\"Aeroplane.\\"  If you love the Chili Peppers, you will love this CD!  The only negative thing I would say is that it does contain a lot of swear words, so you need to be careful if your pre-teen is listening in.
B000002IWH|5.0|I recently became a HUGE \\"The Crow\\" fan. I immediately bought this and the soundtrack score when I had the chance. I really do like most of the music on this CD. As people have said before, it brings you back to the movie. The crew of this movie did a nice job with song selection. Why can't they make music like this anymore?
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|My husband received 2 copies of The Dark Knight for Christmas.  He took one copy back and came home with The Illusionist!  At first I had no interest in watching it.  I settled down and thought i would give it a chance.  Wow - it has quickly become my favorite movie!  Edward Norton is mesmerizing as Eisenheim!  It is one of the best movies I have seen - I am not quite sure why i am only now discovering it, (December 2008), but i am glad I did!
B001BPJJ82|5.0|This movie is among one of the many reasons to own BluRay. The visuals are simply stunning. The movie is really great too, although some might not like the storytelling style of the movie; I found it to be entertaining and fun. I can't stress how arresting the visuals are. Many of the shots are incredibly vivid and are a great workout for your system. This movie would function as a great barometer for color accuracy. Simply a must-own (or at least, must-vew) BluRay.
B000VECAC6|5.0|Not a lot to say about this movie to anyone who is a Monty Python fan, and anyone who isn't should see it anyway, it's a story packed with brilliant humor about biblical times.<br /><br />It's NOT about Jesus, it's simply a very funny story happening in the same time period, when messiah cults were the norm, and Brian may be the only person who isn't crazy.<br /><br />Great blu-ray edition of this movie, the behind the scenes extras and radio spots and other features are great, and the quality is excellent (no apparent clean-up work done, unlike say, Blade Runner, but the film grain makes it feel all the more theatrical in a way).<br /><br />As always it has one of the most unforgettable endings in movie history. :)
B001DTUTU8|3.0|Am I the only one who was suckered by the 2-disc special ed.? Since Amazon  no longer gives any details about the contents of each disc, we're pretty  much in the dark about what we're getting. I assumed there would be special features on the 2nd disc, not that it would be the digital copy only. Many titles are marketed with digital copies but this is  the first one I've seen that's been so misleading. So I paid extra for a 2nd disc which I won't use. Buyer beware!
B001F7MSFM|5.0|I really loved Hellboy, so when I heard that there was a sequel in the works, I could hardly wait to see it.  I was NOT disappointed. I've been a Ron Perlman fan since Beauty and the Beast.  He was wonderful then and he still is.  It was nice to see him and Roy Dotrice (who played FATHER in Beauty and the Beast) reunited even if they were not in scenes together.  Luke Goss as Prince Nueda (sp?) was simply fabulous.  I know how he looks without makeup, so I was a little disappointed not to see his handsome face.  But even in all that makeup, he was superb.  And his voice sent chills down my spine.  To say nothing of the thrilling acrobatic stunts his character performed.  Back to Ron Perlman.  He is great with the one-liners.  He had me cracking up.  In the red makeup and bodysuit, or out of it, he remains the consummate thespian.  No, this review is not about the plot.  Others have written about the plot.  Or about the special effects, all good.  For me, watching Hellboy 2 was an emotionally satisfying experience, like going to the movies on Saturday afternoon when you were a kid, and having a blast!<br /><br />So, all criticism aside: Just see it because it'll bring out the kid in you.  It's just that good.
B001NU1AO6|5.0|If you appreciate classic live showmanship, you'll love this!  Rick Wakeman is a Master of the keyboard synthesizer. Along with the full London Symphony Orchestra and English Chamber Choir providing excellent atmosphere, the exceptional narration of the Jules Verne tale lets your immagination run wild.   I had the opportunity to see this outstanding performance on TV in the mid-70's. I immediately went to the local record store and ordered the LP.  The LP is worn out --- enter mp3's & CD's.  :)   The usual annoyances of a live recording are present, it all lends itself to the experience and lets you feel you're right there in the concert hall.    Turn the lights down. Turn the volume up. Enjoy the \\"Journey\\"     -..  .
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I watched the new Indie   DVD with friends and we agreed - it's the best one yet!  Plenty of action,  Plenty of laughs.  A satisfying couple of hours.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|This CD is incredible. Any Paramore fan will love this and any one who just likes there music will become bigger fans after hearing this. :D
B000KJU1HI|5.0|The original version of DLB was and still is a groundbreaking documentary of a pivotal moment in the career of Bob Dylan, and rock music in general, but it is less about the music than it is about the drama and pettiness that Dylan was involved in behind the scenes. The new 65 Revisited disc shows more of the softer side of Bob, particularly towards his adoring British fans, and also presents the song performances in their full, unedited forms. \\"To Ramona\\" in Sheffield and \\"It Ain't Me Babe\\" in Manchester are absolutely wonderful! I would highly recommend this new expanded version of DLB, even if you already own a copy of the old version. The special packaging, books and postcards included are a nice bonus.
B001D08SK0|4.0|This is 50th Anniversary reissue of one of the most important recordings of the 20th century, and as such, must be judged to the highest of standards.     I was disappointed in the LP reissue. Why didn't they do 45rpm reissues for such a great album? Even the Classic 200-grm reissue sounds better. I've yet to compare the CD to my KoB SACD, but the LP is too bright, the drums are too loud and the bass and piano are pushed to the back.    I know this is nit-picking, but since this set is likely to be purchased by people who already have this material, this translates as a both job. They should have handed it over to the Analogue Productions team to do.
B001F7MSG6|3.0|I will have to say I really enjoyed Hellboy 2 even though I were not the biggest fan of the first.  I don't know anything about the comic book but as far as I was concerned it really didn't matter for me.  I found it to be really enjoyable with the incorporation of certain comedy moments.  Even though I didn't laugh at certain parts of supposed humor they still made it a pretty good effort.  I know they tried to make a scene of him being drunk funny but it just was I guess the cliche of how a drunk person would act and not so much how an individual would.  I am glad I watched Hellboy though its not my favorite superhero movie its not the worst.  Even though I would of liked more story then action I still enjoyed the action sequences and it was never overwhelmed with all action.  Through the whole movie I never thought to myself this movie is so bad I cant bear it anymore but neither did I go out and buy it.  Though I enjoyed it I wanted to love it but I couldn't bring myself to it and go out and buy it.  That is what I do with movies I love I rent first than I buy unless I know its gonna be loved.<br /><br />When I watch a blu ray I always think to myself \\"does it look good enough to show off what blu ray is capable of\\".  Some movies are just horrible and should not of been transferred until someone knew what they were doing but this movie surpassed my expectations.  The blu ray version of this movie is awesome and the detail in certain scenes are fantastic.  The audio is top notch as well with everything sounding very dynamic and just overall it was great to crank up the surround sound.  When everything comes together in action sequences I appreciated the movie all the better.  Though like my title the blu ray is worth a see and there is also a movie on the blu ray that is also worth it.

031606792X|5.0|I thought this book was amazing!  In fact the entire Saga was amazing.  I'm not much of a reader but all 4 books kept me reading into the early morning- especially Breaking Dawn.  I couldn't put it down!  At first I wasn't really happy about having to read from Jacob's point of view but after getting into his \\"book\\" it was perfect and began to understand why we needed to see things from his angle.  I'll be disappointed if this book isn't made into a movie- I felt it was great- the best of all 4!
1594201927|5.0|Niall Furgeson wrote and entertaining and educatinal book. It really gives a perspective of our current financial crisis and how it compares with past financial upheavals. While he wrote the book prior to the current credit freeze, he saw it coming. I wish I had!  A must reading for anyone currently investing in the market.    Frank

B0002Z1EG2|3.0|As a new country fan, not familiar with much of her work, even though I am 52, I wasn't that impressed with the cd.  There were some nice songs, some pretty ballds, but there is nothing outstanding about her voice or songs to warrant one album selling 30 million copies.   Her voice is pleasant but she has no range or power at all.  My conclusion is her records were produced to appeal to the largest audience possible by being as bland as possible with somewhat risque lyrics.  Is she really a country artist? The only really country song I heard is the last one on the album. The rest are as much pop, disco or rock as they are country.  What exactly is her appeal aside from being very pretty?  Needless to say I will not be ourchasing her new cd if and when she ever gets around to recording one.

Very good stuff throughout. *** If you are preparing to write programs professionally, starting with this Java 5 book won't hurt. A lot of Java 5 code needs maintaining.... *** BTW: when you read these Java books and they mention databases, don't believe a word of it. Go directly to your database vendor's site and read what they tell developers. Read it twice. Carefully, both times. Work the examples.

B00004YA66|5.0|I'm not sure what determines which movie will be a blockbuster success, and which one will go almost unnoticed.  This one should have been a blockbuster in the theaters. I had seen it on television, and asked for the DVD for Christmas.  The writing is brilliant, and the action and unfolding relationship stories will keep you on the edge of your seat. It's a father-son love story, it's a murder mystery, it's a time travel sort of bump in the universe.  I won't give away the ending, but it still gives me goosebumps. I highly recommend this movie.
B000G8NXYQ|5.0|A Fellini movie is never about the \\"plot\\" -- it's about the images, the music, the mood and the vast tapestry of human lives being lived that he conjures. In this affectionate memoir of growing up during the Fascist era in a seaside town, the old master delivers a final, wistful performance. What we get here is a complete picture of an era shown through the eyes of an adolescent.<br />Yes, the familiar Fellini types inhabit this movie -- the women with massive breasts and bums, the toothless men, the priests, the temptestuous family members -- but in this movie the caricatures are toned down. A professorial narrator shows up from time to time, lecturing us on the history of the town -- and greeted with contemptuous farts by onlookers.<br />The music as usual is superb.<br />There is also a serious side to this gentle movie. The bumptious fascists are ridiculed for their ridiculous parades but they are also capable of serious abuse bordering on torture.<br />Of many stunning images, the scene of a huge luxury liner looming through the mists is perhaps the most memorable. But for me the final scene of a country wedding carried the biggest emotional wallop. The camera slowly retreats as the party breaks up until it is literally saying goodbye to the guests, the party, the memories -- and life itself. I don't know of any other scene in a movie that has the actual feel and quality of a memory.
B001LMRCP2|2.0|This would have been a brilliant 5-star EP, but the track LOST+ (with Jay-Z) is HORRENDOUS, and effectively reduces this to 2 stars.<br />Viva La Vida is not only a monumental work of art from our beloved Coldplay; I regard it to be one of my favourite albums - period.<br />So, not to pick on Jay-Z: the idea to add a rap track (from anybody) over the already perfect composition \\"Lost\\" is akin to taking a crayon to the Mona Lisa.<br />Fine, somebody had the idea.<br />Fine, forgive Coldplay for trying this.<br />But why, dear God, WHY was this actually released!?  The fact that this was released is, in my humble opinion, completely indefensible and unforgivable.

1594200106|5.0|I'm young, but I know good literature. And this definitely tops my list of the best literature that I've ever read. I dont know why more people havent discovered this book, but those of you who have, you know what I am talking about. It has everything a good book needs: suspense, romance, intrigue, history, and a plot that is just right. I love it, and I hope you love it too.
B00003CXB4|4.0|I owned a VHS copy and didn't want to purchase another copy (DVD) however my VCR has been broken for years now.  My 13yo son wanted to see the movie so I ordered it.  Disney stores didn't carry it--said it is in a vault for at least another 5years.  I was pleased that it is authentic Disney copy and that it has an extra song added to the movie without redoing the movie.  There is also extra song of Disney stars singing 'The Circle of Life' along with several interactive games. I love the the movie even more than when I first saw it and Mufasa's death still makes me cry.

031606792X|5.0|I have just finished Breaking Dawn and I truly can not understand the negativity about this book.  I have read all four books and I have read them closely and I can say 100% without a doubt that I do not feel this book was rushed.  I think everything was answered the way it needed to be answered.  I was reluctant to read this book because in my eagerness to learn about the author and the series I had read all of the reviews both negative and positive.  With the negativity from so many I wasnt sure I could read this book and enjoy it like the other three. I often judge my interest in a book if I can get into it within the first chapter and if it can keep my attention.  I have read many books where the chapter has caught my attention and then midway through the book I could not read anymore.  I never lost interest for a minute.  I never wanted to put this book down.  I think all the questions were answered in the way they needed to be without rushing.  To me it reminded me a little of the last Harry Potter books where all the questions were wrapped up within one book and that was along the same length.  Like I said I enjoyed this book immensely and would reread this whole series in a heart beat as I have done with every series that has caught my attention.    Edited to include more specific opinions    I was trying to put a review without spoilers yet I see that was an impossible task now. Let me start with what i found positive. I found the fight with the Volturi positive. I did not feel that it had to come to an all out brawl for it to be a \\"fight\\". I liked the inner workings of the group that stood to fight them. I liked the fact that Bella had found her power and the one thing she so desired, to protect her family, is what she did. I loved the mind games that the Volturi tried to play and failed especially Jane and Alec failing miserably to use there powers against the Cullens, the Denali's, the Amazon's, wolves etc.. I thought it was positive that people with somany differences could unite as one like the the vampires with the wolves to fight a common cause. They stood there ground as one. That is seldom seem in this world today. I liked how Bella was able to keep Charlie in her life while not giving him too much information. I thought the friendship formed between Jacob and Edward was positive. Bella loved them both but choose Edward. Jacob was her bestfriend but Edward was her one true life and to be able to keep both in her life was remarkable. I will say I wasnt sure about the imprinting of Renesmee at such a young age, it wasnt something that was done deliberately. I took it as something that Jacob had no control over and if anything ever happened to Edward and Bella, \\"nessie\\", would at least be safe because Jacob would protect her with all that he had. I had no problems with the pregnancy. I actually thought it was a positive thing. Bella was married and had waited till she was married. While the pregnancy was unexpected and many wanted her to \\"take care\\" of the pregnancy she did not she fought to keep it. Her transfomation was exactly what I had expected. Bella's mind never worked like a regular persons so why should her transformation be any different and by injecting the venom directly into her heart and then the rest of her body it allowed to the transformation to take effect quickly. I was not surprised she did not act like a typical newborn. Again why would we expect anything different for someone who throughout all 4 novels never reacted the way that was expected. Bella's shield had protected her as a human whats to say that shield did not help curb the typical newborns lust or reactions. What I thought was most positive was that everything that was left unanwsered in the other books finally had a conclusion. Whats so wrong with a happily ever after? While I did not want the story of Edward and Bella to end it would have been more frustrating for me to have been left with unanswered questions. Like I said in my original review this book reminded me of the last Harry Potter book in the essence that all the questions and the what ifs were answered. In order to do this you needed to have the length. I started this entire series Christmas Eve and finished it yesterday. Not once can I honestly say was I ever disappointed with anything. I have read many books by a wide varitey of authors so I am not nieve as to how novels go and what I feel makes a good ending. Ultimately if I am captured by the first chapter and my attention is held than I feel that the book or novel is well written. I again these are just my opinions.
B001ACH4DS|2.0|David Cook was the first American Idol contestant or winner that I looked forward to his CD release. His unmistakenly soulful, powerful voice is unfortunately drowned out with the overly hyped, sickenly repetitive overly-produced sound of this CD. This music absolutely NOT what got him voted as the winner of American Idol this year.  Gone were the cleverly produced and arranged songs that let his amazing voice shine.  And every song sounds painstakingly same....yawwwn....could have been a Daughtry CD I was listening to.  In my opinion, his voice is far superior to Daughtry's, but as mentioned before, it is drowned out by a repetitive, hyped sound.    Very disappointing for someone with his caliber of talent.  His writing abilities have much potential though, only reason this review even got 2 stars.  This will be my only Christmas gift returned!

B0002KPIKA|5.0|Yeah, yeah, the fright wigs are hideous and the costumes are kitsch. The silent spectres that lurk around the edges of the scenes are pretentious and distracting. There are no visual rewards in the production, despite some fine camera work and editing. It's  'yo mamma' ugly. The only virtue of such creepy visuals is that your eyes are not distracted from the sub-titles.<br /><br />But the singing!  OMG! I've never heard better singing, from the whole cast, live on stage, on CD, or on any other Handel DVD. Soprano Veronique Gens is transcendent in the role of Agrippina, but soprano Ingrid Perruche is almost as good as Poppea. Male soprano Philippe Jaroussky has to be considered a gift from the Gods of Music to our undeserving generation; he sings the role of the decadent boy Nero with such sly inflections of malevolence that even his purple Afro can be ignored. Countertenor Thierry Gregoire is handicapped by wearing the only non-absurd costume in the production, making him look helplessly wimpy, but when he gets an aria to sing he delivers such suave vocal control that his hapless physical presence is forgiven. Bass Nigel Smith sings a robust but graceful Claudius. There isn't an awkward ornament or a dubious tuning to be heard in the entire ensemble.  Likewise the orchestra and continuo: superb tuning, rhythmic perfection, complete authority of style! Even seated in his office chair at the podium, conductor Jean-Claude Malgoire coaxes both high energy and tasteful delicacy out of his period-instrument orchestra. The musical values of this production are too great to carp about costumes, or to deduct a star from one's rating. Musically, this is the best Handel currently available on DVD.<br /><br />Agrippina was composed for an English audience while Handel's heart and mind were still in Italy. In fact, several of the best arias were recycled from cantatas that Handel had composed in Rome. It helps, I think, to have singers like Gens and Jaroussky, and a whole cast of Romance language speakers, singing this highly Italianate opera. Their pronunciation/articulation is precise and proper enough to be understood, and their ensemble is tightened by their shared sense of the language.<br /><br />Two previous reviewers have criticized the acting of these singers. Once again, I have to say that their best defense is the quality of their vocal technique. Nevertheless, given the ludicrous costumes, I didn't find the acting so shabby. Each character is assigned a single constant affect -- that's the dramaturgical scheme here -- and each maintains her/his affect effectively. Nerone is a perverse little creep, a spoiled mama's boy who (we know) will have his mama murdered as soon as he gets a chance. Poppea is a sly slut. Agrippina is \\"a pit bull with lipstick\\" who fully expects to be the real emperor once her silly boy Nero is enthroned.<br /><br />The sound recording on opera DVDs DOES matter. Fortunately, in this case the techies were as good as the performers. This Agrippina is an acoustical milestone.ge speakers, singing this highly Italianate opera.

B00180R06I|3.0|After reading all the hype surrounding this film, I couldn't wait to see it. Criterion has done a masterful job with the restoration, and the packaging is sumptuous. Full marks!    The film itself, sadly, is a disappointment. It was so disjointed that the accompanying audio commentary is a real boon. Even then, it becomes apparent that Vampyr is a \\"triumph\\" of style over substance. The conclusion of the plot, such as it is, has holes big enough to drive a truck through, and the whole thing seems like Dreyer simply wanted to make art for art's sake - much to the detriment of the story. Film students may appreciate Dreyer's philosophy as revealed through his technique, but the rest of us really need to watch it three times to make any sense of it: first, without the audio commentary; second, with the audio commentary; and third, again without the audio commentary. Even for a 73-minute film, that's simply too much of a commitment to make.    That leaves the fear factor, of which there is basically none. Vampyr may well have been frightening to audiences of the day - although I can't even see my grandmother being moved by this, back in the day - but it's far from spine tingling 75 years on. The whole thing is rather like a disjointed, vaguely unsettling dream. That's the effect Dreyer was aiming for, but his success is our loss.    Four stars for the job Criterion has done, two for the film itself.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I'm not a comic book reader. Haven't been one for decades. I haven't seen any of the 'modern era' Batman movies, just one of Superman and the first Spiderman. I haven't seen the Hulk, the Iron Man, or the Catwoman, either, so maybe my opinion isn't worth much, but I was bored by The Dark Knight. I wanted it to end long before the final rampage, and especially before the preachy and inconsistent climax on the two ferries, when ordinary people turn out to have good-guy core values even after they've proven just the opposite all the way through the film.<br /><br />Okay, so Heath Ledger was brilliantly weird. Why he should be regarded as a supporting actor I can't comprehend, since he was the only person who was 'acting' in the whole flick. The others were just wearing their make-up and trying to remember their blocking. Ledger's performance was not enough to shed human interest on the special effects, particularly since they were so corny. There was no humanity, no human issue, in this film. Even Spiderman had plausible human dilemmas.<br /><br />There was a lot of blatant \\"moral philosophy\\", however. A lot of jabber and symbolism about 'good and evil', and since it was the part of the film that, people told me, raised it above the ordinary, I think I have at least an outsider's right to react to the morality being preached, which was an extreme version of the Objectivists' 'special person' quasi-Nietzschean superman morality, the same morality as that of Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, the morality that claims the authority to defy society for society's good. It's the morality of Jack Bauer, the torture specialist in the TV show 24. Closer to real time, it's exactly the morality of Mohammed Atta, Timothy McVeigh, and Dick Cheney. It's not good enough for the kids who read comics and it's not good enough for the adults who have to make sense of modern times. It's scary to me how easily people accept it in the theater.
B00005JPKE|4.0|The most striking thing to me about Clint Eastwood's companion piece to Flags of our Fathers is how quiet it is.  Despite the fact that this is a war movie with plenty of graphic violence and intense combat sequences, there is nevertheless an erie calm to the proceedings.  Maybe the silence is the calm before the storm....the anticipation and dread that envelops the Japanese soliders as they wait for the inevitable attack by America.<br /><br />The stillness also adds a meditative quality to the film, which pays homage to the sacrafices made by the Japanese troops.  Unlike Flags of our Fathers which tried to do too many things, Iwo Jima focuses entirely on the days leading up to the battle all the way until its conclusion.  Eastwood masterfully examines the gambit of emotions experienced by the young soldiers;  fear of war, loyalty to their ountry, the desire to die with honor versus the desire to survive and see their families, the pointlessness of battle and their own interpretations of who and what their enemies truly are.<br /><br />The movie is elegantly filmed and rewards the patience and intelligence of viewers who understand the movie's ultimate theme:  that in the grand scheme of things war is more than just a glorifed game of good vs. evil or cowboys and indians.  It is a bloody and unforgiving conflict engaged in by participants who are equally human on both sides, regardless of what flag they are fighting under.
B0000AFX64|5.0|This is great family sci-fi movie. The movie is action packed with a great story line and very good actors. Lorne Greene is perfect in the role of Adama, the leader of the surviving human colony. I highly recommend this video for anyone who loves a great science fiction movie. The effects are great and the cast is superb. I believe it to be much better than the new version that is on television right now.

0307455874|5.0|Since Barack Obama is going to be our next President, I think it's important for all to read this book. It's very thorough on his views of very important issues.  I wish all presidents-to-be would write books that explain their beliefs & ideals.  It's 100 times better than watching the ultra right & left wingers discuss their opinions about political candidates.  If you read about them from their own words you have a better idea of what is true and what is fiction when discussing the candidate with someone else. Most of the book is pretty interesting.  It gets long in some areas but for the most part it's a good read.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is a fantastic movie. I had high hopes for it after seeing Batman Begins and hearing about Heath Ledger's performance, but even this didn't prepare me for how truly amazing this movie was.     As with Batman Begins, The Dark Knight removes much of the over the top Comic Book type theatrics and melodrama of the previous incarnation of Batman theatrical endeavors for a more thoughtful look at the psychology behind the characters. Motive is key to much of the story and while there is your requisite action and jaw droping special effects, the true grace and elegance of this movie is the eloquence and subtlty of the story, dialogue and intereactions of the characters. Nothing is as it appears, there are fine shades of grey and there are definitely points of exploration into the depths of the human psyche and what drives it. Nothing is taken for granted and the movie makers allow for the audience to use their intellegence and have their own opinions. Right and Wrong aren't always clearly defined and while good arguements are made for both, in the end, it is left up to the viewer to decide.    The Dark Knight has all of the elements of the greatest of movies and stories and it will not disappoint. This is the ultimate in think persons action movies and with the great story-telling and visual canvas, is, in my opinion, one of the greatest movies of all time.
0061438294|4.0|There are some imperfections in the text as some review already mentioned, but I could not care less. This book is packed with great and very useful information. It manages to compact it well and give you the juice. In some parts it is repetitive, but it is because it's the same effect under a different scope.    In short, packed with great information and very useful. It also seems convincing because references are everywhere, and the author avoids exaggerations and bold statements.
B001O7JHVG|1.0|With all the great films produced throughout the history of cinema, why do the studios insist on churning out garbage like this film onto blu-ray?  I mean, let's be serious, would any fan of Tango and Cash really be concerned with the improved visual aesthetics provided by blu-ray?

B0017V7GTY|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for over a month now and can't stop.  Every song is good..no throwaways. Although the cd pays homage to Bruce Springsteen with the Springsteen lyrics sprinkled throughout their songs they don't sound like him.  I just saw them last night and they are phenomenal live!! They play with such energy and passion.  I highly recommend this cd.
B00000J7JO|3.0|Despite a re-teaming of Frusciante and producer Rubin, the band is in a different space then when they recorded their arguably strongest disc BSSM. It is now about accessibility, radio hits, and selling records- in a way that still promotes the band as a unique entity but nonetheless nullifies much of their original potency in more chewable-sized conveniences. In the way they were able to get past their misfire OHM and open up the ears of so many new listeners with a consistently well put together product, Californication is every bit the comeback disc it was said to be, but those craving what made the band so zesty in the first place would sadly realize the end of that era was upon us.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I've used this for a little over a month now with no problems. If I had to come up with anything negative to say about it, I guess it would be the plastic USB cord suction cup that is supposed to adhere it to the windshield. The clip for the cord is too wide for the cord which allows the cord to fall out. I've driven rigorously without the suction cup clip and the gps never falls off of the dash. No problems so far.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|I have been a Doctor Who fan for many years and was curious when I heard about this spinoff series.  I'd seen a few episodes on BBC America and was intrigued, so now, a few years later, decided to buy the first season.  It's alot darker, but it grips your attention and won't let you go; it's also alot more graphic than your average U.S. drama.  But that just seems to add to its appeal.  If you like Doctor Who, or are already a Torchwood fan, I would definitely recommend this product.

That's Duffy    Years from now, history will record Winehouse as the one who started the contemporary 60's soul renaissance, but my money's on Duffy as to who defines the genre.  This is truly a 5 Star album, but I penalized it by one star for following in Winehouse's wake as opposed to opening new territory.  Be anxious to see the Sophomore effort to determine if she's got staying power.

B000002UA9|3.0|Early Beatles albums contained a healthy mix of McCartney-/Lennon-penned originals alongside a batch of cover songs that the band performed with gusto onstage. Some of the studio cover songs were hearty rock `n' rollers that perfectly captured the group's aggressive, raw mentality when playing live, while others were pedestrian crooners best played as dinner music. Unfortunately, though it shows flashes of early brilliance, \\"Please Please Me\\" has a little too much dinner music.<br /><br />That's not to say that there aren't a few great cover songs here. \\"Boys\\" (Luther Dixon/Wes Farrell) is a rollicking rave-up enhanced by the great (and perhaps underused) voice of drummer Ringo Starr. And closing out the album is the classic \\"Twist and Shout\\" (Phil Medley/Bert Russell), a feel-good, get-your-butt-on-the-dance-floor rocker where John Lennon's ripping vocals were strained to the max in order to finish up the record during a long day in the studio back in 1963.<br /><br />To give the Beatles credit, their repertoire of onstage and studio covers songs was vast, reflecting the boys' wide array of musical tastes. In today's world, the writers of many of these chosen covers are obscure, and that's OK in my book if the songs are somehow stimulating. Unfortunately, though, the Beatles were likely told by the big-wigs at Parlophone to include schmaltzy pop standard \\"ballads\\" to appease the female audience that would one day adore them, and thus, we get rather bland choices like \\"Anna (Go to Him)\\" (Arthur Alexander), \\"Baby It's You\\" (Burt Bacharach/Luther Dixon/Mack David) and \\"A Taste of Honey\\" (Bobby Scott/Ric Marlow).<br /><br />On the flip side, the melodic McCartney/Lennon love songs on this record are rather good, especially \\"P.S. I Love You\\" and \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret.\\" And the duo also strike gold with a few early classic gems like \\"I Saw Her Standing There,\\" \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"Love Me Do,\\" all riveting, catchy songs that showcase the Beatles' various budding talents in different ways.<br /><br />So while the Fab Four's hearts were probably in the right place when they (and their \\"superiors\\") selected these cover songs, the end result is that portions of \\"Please Please Me\\" are a bit flat. But all these years later, perhaps these slip-ups in cover choices could be viewed as a good thing, since it shows the Beatles were mere mortals whose touch did not produce gold every \\"single\\" time.nt ways.

031606792X|5.0|This book began a little slow, but picked up quickly and definately did not disappoint. I loved all of the Twilight books and this worked nicely as the last book..but I still want more!! I want to know what they will be doing for forever and how Reneseme and Jacob will turn out. If Bella's parents ever figure EVERYTHING out. Still, though it left me with many questions, I still absolutely loved it.
B001DUJNGS|5.0|this album is a major step up for micheal but more importantly its a big improvemnt from the previous disc. it really feels like the 90s enigma (i even heard the monks voices on one song, but forget witch one at the moment). heck, whatever micheal is doing now, its reviving my faith in the group. a posteriori was way to techno sounding, everything was the same old beat and instrument. but this, all songs take u to a different adventure. i like the tittle track, la puerta de celio, till my dying day, deja vu, superficial, we are nature, downtown silence. also some parts of between generations. if u wanna relive the glorious 90s enigma days, this is a good place to start.

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The highly anticipated sequel to 2005's BATMAN BEGINS was released in theatres Thursday, July 17th at 3,040 Midnight showings all over the country.     For the past 30 years (since Christopher Reeves' SUPERMAN in 1978), superhero movies have become a major enterprise, raking in millions of dollars every year. Before it was knocked out of number one by THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, Joel Schumacher's BATMAN FOREVER held the record for largest box office opening weekend ever, bringing in (what used to be considered a whopping) $52M. After that, there was of course the ever popular HARRY POTTER series, its first installment grossing over $90M in its opening weekend. However, audiences were cast under a new spell (forgive the horrible pun) with Sony's SPIDERMAN Series, which constantly broke every record in the book. Even the movie monstrosity PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN couldn't cramp Spidey's style. There were other comic book films that did extremely successful, including The X-MEN series and new release IRON MAN, which opened in theatres in early summer 2008. After all of this ascending popularity, it was only appropriate that THE DARK KNIGHT had the largest opening weekend in history, grossing $158M in a 3 day weekend, $18.5M in a single midnight showing, and the first film to break the $200M line in a period of only 5 days. Yes, THE DARK KNIGHT has proved to be entertaining and fun to watch, but is there something more to this action-packed movie than just cheap thrills and explosions? I believe there is.     THE DARK KNIGHT begins with a bank heist that throws violence and chilling performances in the audiences' faces. It brought the audience into the movie shocked and disturbed, which is different than any other superhero movie I've personally seen. At first, I was very skeptical to this taut, tense beginning. This past summer has been a series of disappointments; many of them highly anticipated films that were expected to do well. M. Night Shyamalan's THE HAPPENING started with a bang, but slowly deteriorated into a jumbled mess of bad scripting and shameless acting. Angelina Jolie's action/thriller WANTED opened ridiculously and continued down that path until it's unbelievably silly finale. Even Spielberg's new installment to the INDIANA JONES series was atrocious, leaving legends Harrison Ford and Cate Blanchett ashamed and mortified. Some light spots in the summer included Robert Downey, Jr.'s comic book adaptation of IRON MAN, which received fabulous reviews from audiences and critics alike. The film version of SEX AND THE CITY was had positive audience reactions with fair reviews and a good box office quota. And who could forget the insanely adorable robot fairytale WALLE. The summer was filled with ups and downs, but none of them are even close to being on the same level as Christopher Nolan's THE DARK KNIGHT.     The film continued on past the bank heist and traveled down to the meat and bones of each of the characters, shedding light on the psychosis of each individual. Nolan's screenplay (co-wrote with brother Jonathan Nolan) is among the best in the business. This screenplay is up there with PULP FICTION and FARGO in greatest scripts ever and it is just a matter of time before Team Nolan will be as famous and well-respected as Joel and Ethan Coen. The dialogue in the film varies from philosophical to whimsically manic, placing an incredibly uneasy feeling in the pits of the audiences' stomachs. The screenplay played beautifully, like a gothic orchestral piece that flowed together masterfully with the direction and acting. Nolan's direction complements the screenplay fantastically, using very dramatic themes mixed with action sequences that are unmatched in other superhero films. While other films have the feeling of Computer Generated Imagery, THE DARK KNIGHT realistically pulls off the action without making the film feel hokey and fake.     Nolan (who directed the 2000 thriller MEMENTO) can bring an antiquely story like Batman to life in an inventive and fresh style, choosing unlikely plot twists and gritty storylines that can shock even the most unwavering moviegoer. Wally Pfister (Director of Photography) and Lee Smith (Editor) deserve credits as well for there hard work trying to skillfully put the pieces of this masterpiece together. The real atmosphere of the film, however, came from James Newton Howard and Hans Zimmer, the two composers of the film's score. Howard and Zimmer's composition is both frightening and tense at times, but then appropriately switches into heroic and empowering. The music during the ferry scenes is especially noteworthy, heightening the tension to the breaking point.     The cast made the movie enticing and interesting, leaving the audience questioning the characters every minute of the film. Christian Bale's performance as the title character was both dramatic and complex, showing an interesting side of Batman that hasn't been seen before. Although speculation that Bale's performance was going to be a repeat of BATMAN BEGINS, the talented actor proved critics wrong and revealed the character's power struggle with the good and evil within himself. Maggie Gyllenhaal (who replaced Katie Holmes, thank God) was perfect for the role of Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne's love interest. Gyllenhaal's subtle yet effective acting techniques made her performance memorable and efficient. Aaron Eckhart's performance was fantastic. That's all I'm going to say about it because there are some things that shouldn't be said before you see the movie. Just take my word for it, he's brilliant. Filling out the rest of the cast are Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Cane, all giving topnotch performances to there supporting characters. However, there was one actor who seemed to stand out among everyone. You may or may not know him: Heath Ledger.     Heath Ledger performed as the Joker, leaving the audiences with little breath in there lungs from the moment he appearson the screen. People stared in awe as one of America's most beloved stars completely immersed himself into one of the darkest portrayals of all time. Ledger's performance is up next to Nicholson's THE SHINING and Mitchum's CAPE FEAR and should (and probably will) be an Oscar-Winning performance. Ledger makes himself utterly unrecognizable, a rarity with most actors these days. It's not just the facial make-up, but the mannerisms and vocal patterns that make this character memorable. Ledger's joker pulls the audience into the mind of a vicious sociopath, insanely painting a picture of the madman in everyone. Although Ledger's performance gave the audience the willies, it also produced laughter either out of comedy or nervousness. Ledger's untimely passing in January of this year was both unexpected and incredibly saddening. After viewing the young actor's startling portrayal, audiences and critics all agree that Ledger could have been the next Brando or even better. All in all, Ledger's performance stole the show and perhaps will even steal the Oscar.     It's almost a certainty that Ledger's performance will get an Oscar nod, but will the film? It just recently got shafted at both the Golden Globes and the Screen Actors Guild awards, after receiving one nomination each, both for Ledger's performance. After seeing what seemed to be the greatest comic book movie ever, I began to question if it could be in the same category as THE GODFATHER and PULP FICTION? People think that it is completely out of the question, considering that THE GODFATHER and PULP FICTION are masterpieces. However, I believe that it can be in the same category and maybe even a step above.     THE DARK KNIGHT is more than a comic book movie, but rather an intriguing crime drama that explores the deepest pathos of the criminal mind and surveys the age-old story of good vs. evil. It's a rare film that displays great performances, pitch-perfect direction, a spotless screenplay, and fantastic timing (even for its 2 1/2 hour running time). It's thrilling, exciting, nail-biting, sad, hopeful, hopeless, depressing, funny, frightening, and entertaining. It's everything that a moviegoer, a critic, and a filmmaker are looking for in a movie. Internet Movie Database users agree that it is among the best. In fact, THE DARK KNIGHT's average star rating was up with THE GODFATHER and PULP FICTION, taking over the number 4 spot on Greatest Movies of All Time right below THE GODFATHER PARTS 1&2 and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION. It's also been a fad for the past couple of years to nominate the films that are \\"popular\\" for best picture. Movies such as LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and JUNO have been nominated not only for good performances and terrific dialogue, but something that many films these days lack: charm. Although these films were both brilliantly made, they didn't seem like Oscar material at first sight. People weren't opposed to LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE and JUNO being nominated, but when they oppose THE DARK KNIGHT for a nomination, they will leave this moviegoer asking, \\"WHY SO SERIOUS?\\"     Is it possible that this revival of a DC Comic book can win Best Picture of the year at the Oscars? It's possible, but not probable. However, I do think that a nomination is in order for Ledger's portrayal, the Nolan Brother's fantastic screenplay, Christopher Nolan's powerful direction, and a possible nod for Best Picture of the Year. The performances are fantastic, whether the Academy recognizes them or not. Call it what you like, but THE DARK KNIGHT is definitely one of the greatest films ever made. And I'm not joking.
1932100660|5.0|This is essential reading for anyone with even the slightest interest in good health.  Even a modest following of recommendations is bound to improve health status.  Is is also important to understand what forces (Food and medical Industry, government agencies etc) \\"paint\\" information fed to us. One needs to be ones own advocate.
B001IA46D8|2.0|I feel this CD from a songwriting point of view sounds uninspired.  None of the songs with the exception of Greatest Day and How Did It Come To This really pop in this batch of songs.  Beautiful World was a fantastic CD with so many stand out great songs that could easily have been singles (one missed opportunity was \\"Like I Never Loved You\\") - I can just about listen to Beautiful World from start to finish without skipping any songs.    In my opinion, the biggest problem with this disc is not just bland songwriting but the \\"overuse\\" of Mark Owen as a lead vocalist...the least \\"quality\\" vocalist in the group.  I find his voice to be grating and it's the polar oposite to Gary Barlow's very pleasent mid-tenor.  I enjoy the voices of Howard Donald and welcome Jason Orange as a lead vocal contributer...but please, limit the lead vocal attempts of Mark Owen.  As a fan of Take That...I really did try to like his voice but just could not get past his unpleasant vocal tone...sorry Mark Owen fans.  I give this CD 2 stars as compared to Beautiful World which I give a perfect 4 stars to! I eagerly await the next attempt and hope they take their time (take two years if necessary) and deliver a quality release next time.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|It was a great musical, and frankly great for women, but as a guy, I will never get it. I guess there is freedom in musicals unlike any other media, where you can act silly and no one will diminish it, or criticize it.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I'm delighted to have been solicited to review this album.   I listen to it almost daily. I love David Cook's voice. The variety of songs keeps it interesting. Some are ballads and some rock pretty hard.   I really appreciate the flow of songs.  The extra song, Kiss on The neck, hidden at the end of A Daily Anthem is a great bonus.  David Cook has said that quite a few of the songs are about his own life, particularly his American Idol experience, so they give a glimpse into his own Idol journey. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed an album as much as David Cook.
B000PAAJYW|1.0|When I rented this, I rented it from the local library, which is an excellent place for local rentals at no cost, (with the exception of late fees)and thought the film would be good. After all, it won a lot of awards. It had no point whatsoever, I watched two or three times and I still could not understand it. As a director you just cannot throw random mini-plots together and call it a movie. Why did people even like this?The same was true with Punch Drunk Love. What the hell are these movies about!?
0439023483|5.0|While the first chapter of the book is a little slow and gives the false illusion of being another cliche young adult sci-fi, it's essential for the remaining 95% of the book.  You fall into the character of Katniss (yes, a lame name...) and get thrown into an adventure of survival.  The plot is compelling, leaving you to wonder will she (and as other protaganists are added, they) live or die.  The characters live in a world where they are under tight control of the government.  The government lives in the rich and modern capitol, enjoying both these luxuries and exercising their power through abandonment and brutality.  The majority of the people live in twelve districts that each specialize in some form of production (agriculture, mining, etc.).  The districts are left with little sustinence and some are poorer than others.  Katniss resides in the twelfth district (the mining district).  Her home is one of the weakest, full of starving people and virtually no luxuries.  Our protaganist is stong and determined, providing food for her family and carefully placing her trust in only her close friend Gale and her sister.  The governments most flamboyant show of power is through The Hunger Games: A televised show of twenty-four people, aged twelve to eighteen, fighting to be the final victor.  To be the victor, that person must be the last one standing - with all others dead.  As is predicted, Katniss lands a spot on the show.  From each district, a boy and girl is chosen.  They are randomly picked, but a person may choose to volunteer, taking one of the spots for their district.  Katniss volunteers to take the place of her sister who is randomly chosen.  The boy chosen is the banker's son, Peeta, who once saved Katniss and her family from starvation by tossing her some burnt bread.  Katniss has never spoken to him but feels somehow indebted to him.  The contestants are takent to the capitol, spiffed up, and left to make an impression on the audience through interviews.The better they come off in the interview, the more likely they are to get sponsored.  Getting sponsored means that during the game, the contestants can recieve gifts to help them win.    During the interview, Peeta and Katniss make an impression as Peeta declares his love for Katniss.  She believes he is only playing that up for the games, but eventually (a very distant eventually) she realizes he really has been in love with her for a very long time.  The most interesting part comes at the start of the game.  You're constantly on edge waiting for someone to get stabbed in the back - literally.    From here, you must read the actual book or find a reviewer generous enough to spoil the fun, because I certaintly won't.  Enjoy.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|i am now 18 and i loved this movie. i saw it two times in the theaters and am going to get it once it comes out on dvd cheaper. i liked this move partly because i am in high school and i love musicals. i only really realized that it was actually going along with my years in high school. i some times think about  how this movie may give the younger kids a bad impression on how high school life actually is. in real life you don't always get every thing you want. they actually show some of this in in the movie but most high school don't look that nice ether. but i still love this movie no mater what. i may would just tell my kid to not expect that much fun or inter group interaction. this is a good movie for some one who likes musicals or romantic movies my mom cant stand this movie because she does not like musicals. well that's an 18 year old look at this movie i would advise to rent first if you are not to sure. WARNING you watch this 1 time and you cant stop  thanks   amanda hurst   18 year old   hsm lover
031606792X|3.0|I just finished this book today.  I only agreed to let my 12 year old daughter read this series if I read the books first.  I have turned over book 3 to her, but do not plan on giving  her book 4 for quite a while.  The sexual references...while done somewhat tastefully...and the pregnancy/birth plot are still not something I want my daughter reading.  To me, this book seems very rushed...like the author had somewhat of an idea where she wanted to story to go, but she was getting pressure from someone to get the book done and ready for publishing ASAP.  I wish she would have taken her time a little more to develop the story and possibly rethink some of her ideas.  Some really do not like the \\"happy ending.\\"  Hey, I like a good happy ending once in a while.  So, I'm not going to rag about that.  Did Bella deserve everything she got?  Probably not, but whatever.  Bella loses herself in this book.  And maybe that's not the point, since it doesn't seem that Bella knows who she is anyway, but she completely changes once she becomes a vamp.  Most of the characters become twisted versions of themselves in this book.  Charlie and Jacob are prime examples.   Vamps are beautiful.  I get that.  But it was tiring to hear about how beautiful Bella became after she was turned into a vampire.  Edward thought she was beautiful already.  And I respect the author's right to change vampire lore...to an extent.  HOWEVER, no bodily functions mean no bodily functions.  You shouldn't be able to pick and choose just because you want Edward and Bella to conceive a child.  If vampires have no tears, don't have to breathe, have no heartbeat, and have no circulation...then it's a safe assumption that conception shouldn't be an issue.  Ok, I know that she wanted to add \\"Nessie\\" to the story.  But the idea of this caused a lot of eye rolling and head shaking to those of us who are fans of vampire stories.  As much as I  hate to admit it, I did enjoy this series.  It's my Dawson's Creek in the book world.  As I read the last page, I began to wonder if the author would ever write another book in the series about Nessie as an adult and who she ends up with...and how she fits into her vampire family.  Not that I'm encouraging it...but I did wonder.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We got this game for Christmas and just love it.  We have children ages 12 to 4 and all can play and have fun.  A must have!!!!
B0007M22TI|5.0|I watched this on t.v first and just had to get a dvd of my own. I love listening to the Celtic women and watching all that is going on. I also got an extra cd of this for a friend because i enjoyed it so much.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I have been listening to the soundtrack for a month straight! I love it. Only thing is that Rob Pattinson wrote two songs for the moive and only Never Think is on the soundtrack,other than that, it was well worth the money.
B00007KWHP|1.0|Who left the compressor on 11? Terrible remastering. The 1994 version makes mincemeat out of this piece of junk.
B0011ZVL10|4.0|It must really stink to be Phil Anselmo living in the shadow of Pantera, arguably one of the best metal bands of all time. He now fronts Down. People will always compare these Down records to Pantera and its a shame. In the reviewer's humble opinion, they are apples and oranges.     Down is also comprised of Pepper Keenan (C.O.C), Kyle (Crowbar), Rex (Pantera), Phil (Pantera) & Jimmy Bauer (normally the guitar player of Eyehategod - drums on this record). being a fan of all of the aforementioned projects, logic would dictate that altogether, this project would get the thumbs up.    And it does!    If you are a fan of doomier/sludge projects this may be the release for you. Mind you, this album does rock out, but in a different way than a Pantera record. If anything, it lends itself more to a Corrosion of Conformity disk. Anselmo represents his more bluesy side as opposed to the \\"Great Southern Trendkill\\" style vocals of the \\"screamier\\" variety. Bauer is surprising bombastic on the kit and the overall production is choice. All the guitar players really throw down the chunk and achieve a good overall recording.    Look to sample 3 Suns & One Star, I Scream, Her Majesty the Desert & Pillamyd.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|Bought this for my wife about a month ago. She loved the series and could never catch the last season on television. She absolutely loved the gift and I couldn't imagine that anyone who is a fan of this show would be disappointed by this final season.
1576754227|5.0|This is a short, concise and practical book on how to handle never-ending list of jobs. The author has taken very realistic approach. Basically he is saying  - Identify what is important in your life and job  - List down the tasks that you need to do  - Apply 80/20 rule to see what will bring best results  - Pick up top three tasks  - Deal with the most difficult task (\\"ugly frog\\") and take it to completion  - Learn from successful people in your field and do the same    Just 100+ pages but really worth it !
B001KZVQJI|1.0|The new Blu-Ray cut of King Kong runs 187 minutes....which means that this is the theatrical version of the movie. I love Jackson, but it seems we always have to wait through this inferior release for the director's cut. The nonsense of the situation is that so many customers have already purchased the DVD of this movie (many bought both the Theatrical and Extended DVD cuts). I mean...how many times are we supposed to buy it. The moral approach would have been to skip straight to the extended cut for the Blu-Ray, but as it was so eloquently put in \\"Wall Street\\"...\\"Greed Is Good\\"!
B001CQ67Z8|5.0|A friend of mine turned me on to the amazing world of trailer music- starting with this one.  I LOVED it!  The songs are so powerful, so moving, you can't help but be transported somewhere far away.  I'm a writer and this music has taken my words to far different places than they would have traveled alone.  EVERYONE should give it a listen- especially any creative types out there.
0810993139|5.0|This book starts out funny and ends funny. I read the book at work one night while waiting on my 12 hours to pass by. My co-workers thought I was crazy for laughing so hard I had tears in my eyes. This kid had me thinking back to my years of middle school and the way I thought of things in life. I went home that morining and ordered the rest of the series.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|We saw this movie in the theater and I loved it. I received this as a Christmas gift, popped it into the DVD player, and I STILL love it!    I would NOT say there is a \\"lack\\" of dialog - there is enough to accomplish what needs to be communicated. My husband thought there was too little dialog, but he loves action-adventure films. This is NOT that type of film.    This film is sweet, innocent, eye-opening, and endearing. There is nothing to warn parents about, nothing scary. There is a lesson, however: open your eyes and be aware of your surroundings.    What a nice film to sit down to - with or without kids in your house!    Pixar/Disney has really done a nice job with this film. Two thumbs up.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|So I love this movie/short. the star of this dvd is the \\"Commentary! The music.\\" A commentary track that is all new music about the commentary. It is by far the best commentary since the power puff girls commentary from the characters.

0312427646|5.0|While the Queen was out with her dogs one day, the dogs took off and started barking at the traveling library (bookmobile) that was on the Palace grounds.  The Queen feels duty bound to go over and apologize for her dogs' actions.  While she was in the bookmobile she met a young man who works in the Palace kitchen.  She also feels obligated to check out a book, so she leaves with The Pursuit of Love by Nancy Mitford.  She becomes so engrossed in the book that she feigns illness so she could stay in bed to read.  Thus began the Queen's love affair with books in The Uncommon Reader by Alan Bennett.<br /><br />The Queen's love of books doesn't please everyone, though, because she is running late for engagements and isn't paying as much attention to appearances as she used to.  The young man from the kitchen is promoted to help her choose and keep up with her books.  By the end of the book, the Queen has become interested in writing too, and what happens at the very end will surprise you.<br /><br />This novella was an absolute delight.  Readers will love sentences like this, \\"Books have enriched my life in a way that one could never have expected.\\"  It made me think about how reading affects the reader and others around them and how other people view readers.  I was able to relate to the Queen's obsession with books.
1580086810|5.0|An interesting book to peruse - a good  mix of text and photos explains what cultures around the world (including the U.S.) typically eat and how they shop for/obtain their food.  It makes a good coffee table, waiting room, gift-giving book.

With many songs topping 7 minutes, 'Tallica take back the reign of the heavy metal kingdom.  This album is sure to rank in the Metallica cannon amongst \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"Justice\\".

B00001MXXG|2.0|Though the item came in perfect condition, I don't think this title is family friendly.  Sure, it's a hilarious movie but foul language is continuously uttered throughout.  The movie would be just as funny and entertaining without all the swearing and would be appropriate to a larger audience.   It's so frustrating when film makers/writers continuously show that they have no knowledge of the many thousands of words available for use in the English language, and limit themselves (and the viewer)  to  the same mundane use of the \\"famous 7\\".
B0015KO52S|5.0|This is one of the best albums of 2008... hands down.  The combined virtuosity of the members of The Raconteurs makes for musical magic.  I could go on and on about this album but I'll just say this... listen to the first cut and then check out \\"Rich Kid Blues\\" and then you'll know why you need to buy this album.  I tend to be more of a hard rock kinda guy, but I couldn't get this out of my CD player and off repeat on my iPod for weeks!  Buy it and you'll see why!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO's magnificent screen portrait of John Adams and his fellows at a time when they were 'winging it'--as historian David McCullough has it in HBO's online site for the show--is simply brilliant film-making. It should be viewed in every classroom of the nation from which this reviewer ponders the deeply moving experience of having done so in his living room.<br /><br />Adams was the kind of politician--he would have hated the word and the notion to which it refers--for which the most secular among us should urgently pray. He had no stomach for the thing and only wanted to return to spread his best manure-soil mix on his beloved New England farm. Principled, articulate, and stubborn, he learned in the earnest fray of the revolutionary years the art of intelligent compromise. Paul Giamatti never lets us look away from the pain it caused him to lead, nor to easily evade the burden of historical gratitude that we owe to him, to his wife and family, and to those who labored beside them in the birth pangs of a nation.<br /><br />There was no plan, there was no aged wisdom, there was only the pressing task at hand. The making of sausage is never pretty. Rarely has its product mattered as much.<br /><br />Laura Linney is incendiary as Adams' pillar, his rock, his 'best friend' and wife Abigail. Nations have mothers, too. Abigail Adams and Laura Linney make the case for their costly legacy as few others could.<br /><br />Stephen Dillane is exceptionally compelling as Thomas Jefferson, passing through his various experimental stages at a time when the shape of a people's government depended in part on what he thought *today*.<br /><br />We are fortunate that Executive Producer Tom Hanks has turned his formidable intelligence and influence to projects like Saving Private Ryan and John Adams. The man is well on his way to serving as a kind of cinematic elder statesmen, encouraging his fellow citizens to keep their finger in the dike against the surging waters of amnesia and indifference. Hanks could be doing many things or, quite comfortably, nothing. That he engages projects like this one means the world is a slightly better place today than it might have been.<br /><br />'American exceptionalism' has quite rightly taken a lot of heat in recent years. Like most overstatements, it contains a kernel of truth. JOHN ADAMS probes gorgeously, pedagogically, entertainingly at that kernel. 'Almost, Messieurs Hanks, McCullough, Giamatti, and company, thee makest us all exceptionalists'.<br /><br />God bless us every one.ngs or, quite comfortably, nothing.

B001GZ6QDS|3.0|This movie was a disappointment. It was so hyped up by the press that I thought for sure it was going to be absolutely amazing, but it's not as good as Batman Begins, overall. The plot is weak, the dialogue is boring, and it's hard to follow. Not because the plot is intricate, but because the story is just disconnected and vague in places. Heath Ledger delivers a great performance as Joker--that's the best thing about this movie. Most of the  rest is hype. Cool special effects and a lot of action, as you would expect, though.    Not as bad of as sequel as the latest Indiana Jones flop, but just not as good as I was expecting....
B000059ZLH|5.0|This DVD kicks. The band plays a very strong show here. The show is an editing masterpiece and stands to me as a classic of cinema. This DVD tells a story. An exciting one.    James, as per usual on official live releases doesn't really seem up to snuff. About 1/5. He's better actually, on every other Metropolis 2000 and Scenes from a Memory 1999 tour show I've heard. Every one. Whatever the case, if it bothers you, just sing along, and if it doesn't, sing along anyways. I watched it, knowing how he otherwise sings the material and played it loud. I'd blow up my speakers for the awesomeness of this.    The band is about a 4/5. Great show, but not cutting into the time signatures like they do in some of their really spectacular shows. Every song is great to hear, except maybe 'A Change of Seasons'. It's probably the weakest take they've ever done of that song. Shame.    The bonus documentary is about thirty minutes, includes the rest of the songs not found elsewhere on the DVD from the show, and give a nice inside look at the band and what's involved.    Overall, 5/5 for this one. I'll watch it again, and rock out. The sound quality as a recording is excellent as usual. The editing is what really makes this shine. Though it is not the bands best show, that doesn't matter at all. This is a motion picture classic.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|As a huge Jane Austin collector/fan I would like to put in my 3 cents worth. Ive read them all and have the dvd's 2 of some (p&P) and if there is anything I can say is.,..never judge a dvd by the book, you will not enjoy it if you do.  very seldom will you find a screen play that is true to the book.It is not the same medium and cannot always be presented the same and then there is time constraints.I loved this particlar version and yes it could have been more like the former one (I did not care for the male lead)which was more true to the book. however it worked.  I love Anthony Head as the arrogant and snobbish father, as a avid reader of period romace novels he rang true to what ive always pictured the upperclass of that period.  And how could you not like Penry Jones..he had what I call.. The Look..  (colin Firth has it) all in all as a whole I enjoyed it and have it in my Jane Austin collection.  As I said enjoy them all, dont compare them against each other but think of them as individuals, each a different perspective of different people.
B000GIWS7E|4.0|Alright, this DVD is strong. The band played so well during this show, and given that it's a one night, one recording that can go well or badly, you can be happy with the result. I should note for whatever reason James in comparison to the other 230 shows I have is about a 1/5. That is to say he sings better than this on maybe 200 of those 230 shows.     That continues to bother me about the official releases, but the point I'm maybe missing on the uninitiated is that he's very good here. The rating is in comparison to his performances, not singing in general.     The band is about a 4/5. Really strong, but not cutting into the time signatures like they do in some of their really spectacular shows. I enjoyed every song, but did not really take to Octavarium or Metropolis with the Orchestra. It's okay. Part of my beef is that I felt Jordan was off during the intro part. Some takes I love it and some takes it doesn't sit well with me. The Orchestra gives the song a giant feel in parts where I feel the theme is so much more minimalist. To each their own though, it's still played rather well.    The show is really well edited and captures an exciting feel. No where near the awesomeness of Metropolis 2000 however. 4/5 for this.    The bonus documentary is cool and supplements the book with some images to put the story into perspective. I'd have liked more, but I don't think Portnoy has that kind of time. Take it for what it is and enjoy.    Overall, about 4/5. I'll watch it again, and rock out. The sound quality as a recording is excellent as usual, and it's great to see this stuff on screen.
B0017Q8BLQ|5.0|I bought this for my dad for Christmas, and it made a great stocking stuffer.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|It seems Nickelback just keeps getting better. While I wear one cd out listening too it I still can't wait to see what they are going to do next. Some people think they are dirty for speaking of sex, but I dont think so. If you could just be a fly on the wall in most of your public schools today you hear alot worse than this. Nickelback has kept their rock standing and still beat out power ballads that will almost break your heart. This album was endearing to me, mainly because it addresses the drug issue that has arisen. I have lost several friends and family because drugs have taken hold of their lives and they live to get high. It makes you angry and sad all at the same time, I think they captured these emotions well. All in all this is a great album, and I cant wait for the next one.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Paul Giamati and Laura Linney shine and this mini-series brings to light conflicts and issues that are not generally part of our common view of history. Each chapter can be viewed in 2 hour increments or you can do a marathon. Either way, you will be moved and feel your purchase was well worth it. Enjoy!
B001FEA9QU|3.0|I'm a Metallica fan.  Saw them twice in concert for the ...Justice and black album tours.  Bought Master of Puppets when it came out.  Hated St. Anger.  Thought Load and ReLoad were okay.  This album is better than the last three (not counting Garage Inc. which I loved).<br /><br />However, it's a funny thing...<br /><br />I \\"borrowed\\" this album from the internets originally because I paid for St. Anger and was pissed that I paid good green money for that piece of crap.  Oh, and trust me, I tried listening to it.  It still sucked.  So, I said to myself, \\"Dude, download that new one and see if it sucks.\\"<br /><br />I liked the songs but I was bothered because it sounded all distorted and compressed.  I thought maybe it was a bad rip and that's what I get for \\"borrowing\\" it.  So, I thought, I dig it, I'll buy it.  Then Amazon offers it for an amazingly low price (amazing to me, anyway) for half of 10 dollars.  I'm all, \\"Yeah, buddy, $5!\\"  So, I download it and make an honest man of myself.<br /><br />I throw it on with some headphones tonight and, damn, the guitars are clipping.  Bad.  \\"That Was Just Your Life\\" sounds bad.  \\"End of the Line\\" sounds better.  \\"Broken, Beat & Scarred\\" sounds bad again.  It sounds like the rhythm guitar was just mastered too loudly, ie. Hetfield's guitar.  Kirk's leads sound pretty good.  The drums sound alright, too.  But, the clipping is really distracting.  Also, the album sounds really compressed.<br /><br />I know, I'm complaining about compression in an album I downloaded off Amazon.  But, it's at 256 kbps and I have a lot of albums that I ripped off of CD at that rate that don't sound so dense and compressed.<br /><br />It's a good album and you will enjoy listening to it in the car or on the stereo if your speakers aren't very good.  I bet it sounds great on an iPod dock or something.  It's good to know Metallica can still kick some a** but sad that they couldn't get their album mastered properly.
B000286SCO|4.0|This double DVD is awesome and you should absolutely pick it up. James is awesome across both disks. About 4/5. Also about 4/5 for the band. But the phenomenal 1995 tour is missing.    That said, what do you get? A format I love where documentary is spliced into the song material. The Tokyo show is excellent. I love the stage lighting on that tour. The gullible will love this show for all the things they think James doesn't do anymore.     Given that, Disk 2 is equally impressive, but takes cuts from several shows. A best of a few years packed into 2 hours. I love what's provided here, but ultimately, it's why I give this compilation 4/5 instead of 5/5 as well. I recognize there are time restrictions, and label personnel restrictions from this era, but I still feel that this DVD hides from 1995. And that year was absolutely phenomenal across the board. All those great moments from james firing several notes higher than the usual F# in January to the Limelight topping Mercy **** A Change of Seasons in December.     In place of this are some of the unplugged tracks from 1998. I love the tracks included. They are some of my favorites, but this 2nd disk needs that extra hour dealing with 1995-1996.     Hopefully Portnoy, having more freedom with the contract holders than he used to, and with the internet much wider in nature today, will give us a DVD of that era.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|this movie does not have a steady picture. it makes me dizzy to watch it. super bad quality.
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|Maybe it's a generational thing, but this was a fabulously entertaining movie. Camera angles, Peirce Brosnan's singing, blah, blah, blah... Buy it, turn down the lights, turn up the volume, pour yourself a bottle of wine and enjoy the movie.     Are there better singers in the world? Yeah, maybe. Are there better actors for this show? Likely not. Meryl Streep is simply wonderful, she carries the character of Donna just wonderfully. Watching Amanda Seyfried make the transition from \\"Mean Girls\\" to Sophie here is entrancing, and her singing is inspiring.    Christine Baranski is simply hysterical in everything she is in and Mamma Mia! is no exception!    High point? Meryl Streep singing \\"The Winner Takes It All,\\" how she manages to make it such a powerful performance without being ABBA is simply a testament to her ability as an actress. Buy it. Enjoy it. And watch it again and again and again.
031606792X|1.0|Never has so much come to so little. To begin with, I must confess that I am not a fan of the Twilight series, but I admired HOW Meyer did them. They are part of a genre that I do not particularly like, but in the midst of a vast category of books with similar plots, Twilight distinguished itself for captivating fantasy. It's kind of like murder: I don't like WHAT they do, but I can admit when it is done well. If the first three books were perfect crimes, the last was an ugly, botched assassination, wherein Stephanie Meyer tried to kill the victim in broad daylight (or twilight) with a dull butter knife, that hopefully will result in the trial and execution of Meyer's career. Here my halves have a unified opinion of this book: it is the mutilated corpse after a literary crime, deserving cremation. It is a glass of pure drivel that only the most devoted fans or, in my opinion, least intelligent readers will swallow.    Enough with the metaphors, let me elaborate on this travesty. If you've read the first three Twilight books you will be aware of the underlying plot line explaining the opposing desires that torture the (God help me) protagonists. Their love pulls them together and drives them apart (internal conflict), while other stock plot elements intervene and complicate things (internal and external conflict), in an eloquent tragedy sure to captivate fans of the genre.    It is human nature and (good Lord) vampire nature that makes the struggle interesting. Desire is only meaningful when it involves a struggle to get its object. Humans always hunger for what they cannot have, and the uncareful let themselves be carried into lusting for mutually exclusive things. It is the choice that must be made, the sacrifices that are given, and the insight into the mind of the characters that these provide that makes tales interesting. Because all people have felt these things, it naturally strikes a chord to read about them and see into the minds of all of the people. The romantic in all of us loves these stories, and writing them about young, fun, and beautiful people in the context of mysterious fantasies about vampires and supernatural events made Meyer a millionaire.    Of course, all of the preceding books were about the struggle (with climaxes involving choice, usually heartbreaking), and so it is the conclusion of the series, which ought to bring about the ultimate and final choice, that is the most important book. Like all similar series, these books will have devoted fans that have certain beliefs about what the main characters should choose. The price of having a successful story of this nature is that a sacrifice will be involved in the end, inevitably leading to half the fans being let down, but beautifully and tragically so. It would certainly frustrate them that the character did not identify with their viewpoint, but it would not turn them off to the whole series.    But, curse her, Meyer thinks she can have it both ways. She thinks she can write a tragedy and conclude it like a comedy. She thinks it can be a happy ending, with smiles all around, which is fine if you can do it right. But no. She wants to kiss up to all of her fan base and appeal to everybody. She thinks that she can end it without addressing the conflicts, or having anyone making any hard choices, or really saying anything meaningful at all. Nobody learns anything. No one suffers. There is no insight given or lessons taught. It is lazy, sloppy, slipshod writing. As H. L. Mencken might say,    \\"[She] writes the worst [plot] that I have ever encountered. It reminds me of a string of wet sponges; it reminds me of tattered washing on the line; it reminds me of stale bean soup, of college yells, of dogs barking idiotically through endless nights. It drags itself out of the dark abyss of pish, and crawls insanely up the topmost pinnacle of posh. It is rumble and bumble. It is flap and doodle. It is balder and dash.\\"    Ray Bradbury might believe that he had finally been taken up on his suggestion that the public, unsatisfied with fine art, ought to \\"eat stale cake dunked in the weak tea of their own ungodly manufacture.\\"    Let me, for comparison, pose it against another, although well done, piece of art. I quote a review of it:    \\"What's especially refreshing about Spider-Man 2 is its fundamental theme, namely that of choosing self-sacrifice... The movie puts it this way: \\"Sometimes you have to give up the thing you want the most.\\"\\"    In this book, nobody has to give up anything. There is no satisfactory conclusion at all. Intelligent readers will come away feeling dirty for having participated in such an awful display of literary debauchery. Without spoiling it, I can tell you that it is an awkward and obvious attempt to give everyone what they want. It is an insane, poorly formed plot that rides roughshod over previous books' characterizations and plot formula. It requires that the reader suspend intelligent thought and accept the almost magical (not in a good way) way the end is brought about. Anything happens that needs to happen and anything is injected that needs to be injected to create the outcome Meyer wanted, without regard to who the characters are or how the story has gone up til now. It is a messy, ugly orgy of gratification that will not bend to any literary principle. There is no artistic integrity in a tale that will prostitute itself like this. Who cares what they want, or what happens at all when everyone gets what they desire without cost or consequence?    I admit that I am a realist, and I do not enjoy outright, unrealistic escapism to a world that has no texture like ours, filled with romance that has no connection to reality. But I can appreciate when the form is executed well. I would not like it, but I could not criticize it for what does. Prior readers will do well to put this book down and stay home in three years for the movie. This is NOT well done and needs to be demoted back down to theranks of bad romantic fiction.
0307454894|1.0|I was hoping this would be a great story (being that the movie is causing all sorts of hype and it won a number of awards). I had a lot of trouble finishing this book. The characters never fully develop. The writing is sparse and poor. The main character asks questions throughout that are meant to be thought-provoking but detract from the story and make you feel like you're sitting through a seminar with a boring professor. There are plenty of good books about the Holocaust--and this isn't one of them. Don't waste your money OR your time.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is probably the best soundtrack album since 'Romeo + Juliet'. Every track is a winner and the music works so well in the film. other reviewers have appeared surprised by the 'dark tone' of the music. You shouldn't be. Look at the play lists that Stephenie Meyer puts in the front of her books and you will see this is the stuff that inspires her. However, I also don't think it really is that dark at all...dimly illuminated perhaps but not really throw-yourself-in-the-abyss dark. Nothing to frighten the horses!    If, like me, you particularly enjoyed the sublime Blue Foundation track 'Eyes of Fire' (the song that Bella plays on her ipod in the film just before almost getting hit by the truck) and have been searching for back catalogue from Blue foundation, you might have come up against either hideously priced 2nd handers ($100+) or drawn a blank. I have been searching and found you can purchase their cd's from their own website [...] (they are danish, hence the DK). they will ship internationally as many of their cd's don't have an international release YET.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This soundtrack is excellent, i love every song and can listen to it over and over again.  The best part is that for once a soundtrack actually really goes with the movie.  If you like Twilight you must buy this soundtrack you won't regret it.

0375842209|5.0|I too was surprised that this book was tagged as a young adult book.  I find the theme and content very much for adults and wonder if the age group suggested would find this book entertaining.  It was an amazingly good book for adults.

0440238609|2.0|Had the author not stupidly used the term DEMON for the people's animals, he would not have lost the massive audience his books otherwise might have gotten him. I myself refused to see the movie because of this satanic crud, and I will not let my children see it or read the books. The worst mistake a fantasy author can make is to insult millions of people by using terms from real-world faiths.

0743455967|4.0|Stephen King's On Writing is part memoir and part advice and observations on the craft and business of writing. I confess to not having read any of King's fiction, although my mother was a great fan, so I know what most of his novels were about, second hand. There's no question that Stephen King is one of the most successful popular writers of the 20th century, so an opportunity to read his thoughts on writing is not to be missed.<br /><br />This book is not a textbook or workbook on the craft of writing, but instead a very personal reflection from the perspective of its author. This is both its strength and weakness.<br /><br />If you learn by example, the memoir section has a lot to say about how to keep your readers engaged. King shares brief scenes from his life, vignettes of key moments in his development as a writer and a person. These are utterly engaging, and wonderful examples of how much can be said by a few carefully chosen words and images.<br /><br />I was less pleased with the section on writing, however. The advice King has to give is solid, and articulated very well. And there are a handful of truly memorable observations in this book. But mostly, his advice is rather commonplace, sometimes feeling like an uneven and uninspired recycling of Strunk and White. We learn to avoid adverbs and the passive voice. We don't need Stephen King to tell us that. And when the topic turns to something where we might hope for wisdom from a master, such as plot construction, King doesn't have much to say. (He doesn't think anyone should think about plot. Just put the characters in a situation and write down what happens. That may work if you are born storyteller like King, but most writers do have to think about plot construction, at least once in awhile.)<br /><br />King acknowledges this deficiency himself, saying at the end of the book that he was disappointed that most of what he had to say was obvious, and that the aspects of writing that weren't obvious were things he could not articulate well.<br /><br />This is a must-read if you are a Stephen King fan, or just curious about how a hugely successful writer works and views his work. If you are hoping for a book that will teach you how to write as successfully as Stephen King, or even how to write consistently well, this is not the best resource; it is too idiosyncratic and spotty in its treatment of important aspects of the writer's craft and art.l.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|I don't own the DVD yet, but I have seen the movie. Personally, I think it's one of the best family films I've ever seen. If you like movies by Disney and Pixar, I think this is a must-have. It's just like A Bug's Life, awsome.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|This is my first Coldplay album.  I got in mainly for \\"What I Ruled the World.\\" Yeah, I know, that's not the name of the song, but it makes more sense to me than the actual title.  I think it's a great original song, and I enjoy the other songs too.  If you aren't familiar with their music, I think this is a good intro to Coldplay.
B001IWO870|5.0|I received the book in 3 days with regular shipping and it was in great condition! My son is a great fan of Rick Riordan books so this was a fantastic addition to his collection! The price was much better than I could find elsewhere as well!

031606792X|5.0|I was a little late jumping onto the Twilight bandwagon (I honestly didn't read them until right before the movie came out, and particularly because the trailer looked really good to me.)  So I bought Twilight and was so absorbed that I finished it in a day and a half. I then proceeded to finish the rest of the Twilight series withing a week and a half, not putting it down at work and reading well into the night.  I adore these books on the same level as I adore the Harry Potter books.  I am 26 years old and stories that were meant for (come on, you have to admit it) teenagers and young adults enthralled me in a way that Stephen King's The Dark Tower and Anne Rice's Vampire Chronichles enthrall me...albeit with less sticky and overwhelming detail than in Rice's writing, giving me the ability to see in my imagination the way the book was supposed to look.    I don't agree with any of the poor rating writer's reasoning for rating this book one star.  It was told the way Stephanie Meyer chose to tell it (and most likely saw in her head the whole time she was writing it) and I applaud her for giving teenagers a beautiful look into first love, be it all consuming or unrequited.    The only thing that I didn't like about the entire series was Edward referring to Bella as his own personal brand of drug (heroine?).  It made for a poor referance.  I understand why she used it, but while love is sort of like a drug...there are many better ways to phrase it.
0545128285|1.0|unless you are a die hard, must have it, JKR fan. (I was, the operative word being \\"was.\\") This is pure tripe using the Potter series characters as \\"editors\\" and \\"translators.\\"      Sadly, during the introduction Rowling can't remember whether she's a witch or a Muggle and keeping her in tense, requires close reading.     While the Tales themselves are interesting, and have the smell of Aesopian style, half the book is taken up by \\"Dumbledore's\\" commentary on the Tales, of which, there are very very few.    I expected more but after the last two books in the Potter series....I should have known.     Get it at the library, or, if you must, buy it used. I'll send you mine free to save you your $$.
B001GKJ2E8|1.0|Stupid is the word for this movie.  Good special effects and all.  Even the ending almost had me as if I might be watching an original theme/plot.  However at the very end it comes up with the most lame ending of all.  The main character says \\"I was once like you, pathetic..\\" or something close to that.  First of all, since when do regular people need to become assassins?  It makes it sound as if being a mother, father, policeman, doctor, sound bad.  He already has a special gift that 99.9 percent of the rest of the world doesn't have.  Second, the laws of gravity makes it impossible to send a bullet travelling at high speeds to spin into a complete circle?!?!  FART!!!!    Morgan Freeman is a wonderful actor.  I don't know how he got into this POS movie.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|With all the hype, I was really excited to see this flick. I finally got a chance to and have to honestly say it was rather dull. The folks at Pixar are masters of their craft to be sure. I was absolutely blown away by the ARTISTRY of the film. The stunning landscapes, and intricate nuances of the robot world. Absolutely stunning! But the lack of dialogue and silly plot really dropped it down a few notches for me. Now I know all the \\"artsy\\" people out their would disagree. Yes, dialogue is not always necessary and can be used to a films advantage. I just don't think it worked with this film. The two main characters were endearing, but they repeated each others names a bit too often. If I had to hear EVE scream \\"Wall -E!\\" one more time!!! The plot was pretty weak, and silly. It's a shame because this had the potential to be another Pixar classic. But it's one film I don't need to see again.
0312330529|3.0|I'm halfway through Shantaram and I am enjoying it - it helps that I'm actually travelling through India while reading it. However, every so often,  I have to put it down to digest prose that is so purple, I'm caught between nausea and the giggles.     It's a shame, as the story itself is so compelling and exciting (even though occasionally it seems to be just a series of vignettes); it could have benefited from sparse, stark writing. So an average of three stars from me - for a five star read on India, I'd suggest the White Tiger.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This is a really good movie.  Ever since my first time seeing it two years ago, I wanted to buy it.  It isn't for everybody but it is a classic.  I like the way it uses the music in the movie and seems to have a good soundtrack.  It uses different camera styles, repetitions, and strong emotional scenes to really make the audience feel way the characters feel.  Yes, this is a serious movie even though Marlon Wayans is in it and he gives a good performance.  For those who don't know, \\"requiem\\" is a song of mourning composed or performed as a memorial, usually for a dead person.  The title makes more sense after seeing the movie and knowing this definition.  Sometimes the repetition can get to you but it does make you remember it.  You may not want to see every part of it but you will not be able to turn away.  The final 10-20 minutes are very intense and emotional.  I have only seen this movie while in my 20s as I am now and only with people in their 20s so I can't say how an older group of people will see this movie but I think most 20-30 yr olds who like drama and are open to looking at the plight of addicts/dealers will like this movie.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This is the best quality audio and video copy of Matrix series you can get. A nice bonus is digital copy of the first movie. Watching the series right now, and enjoying every minute. Just have to find time to watch all the 35 hours of extras. Highly recommend this set, especially at Amazon's price.
0670020745|1.0|Ego book about the author. I expected more about the near death experience and less about the repetition of how smart she claims to be. Yes she has higher education. Just read a few pages and she will tell you. Book was a complete let down!!
0307387178|4.0|Just finished this one.  I think there is something in all of us that wants to get in touch with the great big world outside, a hunger, a keening...and it's especially true with US corporate types challenged to find the balance.  While Alex McCandless embraced this search early in his life before he had other responsibilities, and he was reckless about it, the picture here is one of a man who - by looking inward - comes to terms with his need for external relationships.  The book was recommended to me by my local outfitter - Evergreen Outfitters, in Luray, VA.  I found the experience reading this fascinating and moving.
B001GM28HO|4.0|Lady Gaga crept up on the modern music scene much like a stealthy predator, sure of its prey's inability to sense or to predict it. She let herself be seen a few times as an unassuming and docile beast, something to be comfortable around. She even let herself be heard, her calls and cries as far from threatening as possible.  But that was before she pounced.     \\"Just Dance\\" isn't groundbreaking. It is a carefree dive into the pop-dance pool, a watering hole that Rihanna, Chris Brown, and the Pussycat Dolls frequent often. Lady Gaga took a sip, and found she enjoyed the refreshing taste. It wasn't much, but it was enough. She found a territory she could call her own, a place to dominate.     The Fame, Stefani Germanotta's debut album as her hyper-reality persona, Lady Gaga, had been advertised through banners and magazines for months before its October '08 release. Advertisements that didn't feature a solid release date, instead acting as true hype generators. Personally, being an avid fan of \\"Dance,\\" these banners only fueled my desire to get my hands on Gaga's album.    \\"Just Dance\\" opens the album like a valkyrie leading the charge (man, what's with me and metaphors?) riding triumphant ahead of her army. If you don't know this song, use your browser. I won't waste time explaining what it sounds like. Follow-up club stomper \\"LoveGame\\" continues the seige war tactics, assaulting us with clever lyrics like, \\"Let's have some fun/This beat is sick/I wanna take a ride on your disco stick.\\" Interestingly enough, her live performance involves a disco stick. It's her long-handled microphone. Dave Aude mixed \\"LoveGame\\" into a musical frenzy, providing Lady Gaga with a proper club song after the lackluster mixes of \\"Just Dance.\\" Dave Aude also took a stab at Gaga's third single \\"Poker Face\\" which is actually an interesting combination of the synths from \\"Just Dance\\" and the more dance-oriented beat of \\"LoveGame,\\" giving us a nice dancefloor-friendly version of the track. \\"Poker Face\\" is a fantastic offering from Gaga, more lyrically sound than either \\"Dance\\" or \\"LoveGame,\\" with a very catchy chorus. \\"Poker Face\\" was preceded as a single by \\"Beautiful, Dirty, Rich,\\" a jam track where the message is pretty much contained within the title, but it is still 3 minutes of fun.     My favorite tracks on the album are \\"Paparazzi,\\" \\"Paper Gangsta,\\" and \\"Brown Eyes.\\" I'd like to take a moment to talk about \\"Paparazzi,\\" though, and how its message is muddled and confuses me. The dictionary ([...]) defines paparazzi as a freelance photographer, esp. one who takes candid pictures of celebrities for publication. Now focus on the lyrics to Gaga's \\"Paparazzi\\"; \\"I'm your biggest fan/I'll follow you until you love me/Papa-paparazzi/There's no other superstar/You know that I'll be your/Papa-paparazzi.\\" The verses do talk some about pictures and whatnot, but this chorus sounds like a stalker case to me! Regardless of what was written, this song is amazing.     \\"Paper Gangsta,\\" after reading about Gaga's label history, seems aimed at the man who signed her to her first label and then ignored her for three months. \\"Don't want no paper gangsta/Won't sign away my life to/Someone who's got the flavor/But don't got no follow-through/Don't want no paper gangsta/Won't sign no monkey papers/Don't do no funny business/Not interested in fakers\\" is the amazing chorus sung vulnerably overtop a fantastic beat and a piano ditty. Really a very telling song and I'm very happy she made it.    My last favorite takes the cake though, Lady Gaga's tour de force as no other song on her album sounds like it (and considering the success of her upbeat and stylistically shallow radio singles, I doubt any song on further albums will either). \\"Brown Eyes\\" starts off with a slow beat which is soon accompanied by a pensive piano and then Gaga's voice, lonely and pensive, countered by a single electric guitar strum, similar to the Across the Universe film rendition of the Beatles' \\"Oh!Darling.\\" She laments the end of a relationship, singing that her song basically boils down to how she lost her guy and his brown eyes. Very heartfelt and full of longing, the song is the clear winner of the album for me because it not only showcases versatility, but also an acceptance of musical styles that aren't so prevalent in the public eye these days.     Summary  The whole album really is top notch production and performances. Those I've mentioned, while very good to my ears, may not be the best to you. Don't wait on this one though, she's going places!
B00000DR5I|5.0|Froese's \\"Epsilon in Malaysian Pale\\" (the original, not the crummy remake) and Tangerine Dream's \\"Rubycon\\" are and will forever be the high water mark for electronic. If I could only have two albums from now until death, these would be the ones.
0452284392|4.0|This book's author explores networks that exist in everything from Hollywood actors to cellular proteins and lets us into the private (and unexpectedly exciting and humorous) world of mathematicians and physics professors. The 80/20 rule is described as it applies to monetary success by people, web site success with Internet traffic, frequency of protein use in cellular reactions, and evolutionary success of DNA mutations. Be forewarned, the chapter on network economy will not be calming at this time of recession unprecedented since the 1930's. The book drags a little at times. What I was most surprised to find is that I came away with feeling of being one with the universe; inexorably linked, networked, both a product of and an influencer of this world. Dude, Ooohhhhmmmm..... Ooohhhhmmmm..... Ooohhhhmmmm.....

0316017922|5.0|I was anticipating this book from the moment I realized that Malcolm was writing it. I thoroughly enjoyed Blink and the Tipping Point and have to say that I also thoroughly enjoyed Outliers. I think that anybody who is deeply interested in success will enjoy this book. I have heard of the theory that success is more luck than talent and have made my own observations of that phenomenon in my own life, but I have never read a book that focused so much on that phenomenon and cited so many counter-intuitive examples. It has made me a much stronger believer in the idea that success in many ways is outside of our control, or rather exposed another way of controlling success whether for ourselves and probably primarily in other people.

B001HQZJP2|1.0|If you plan on viewing this on a PS3, buyer beware. It does not have audio. Read the other reviews and decide if this is worth it. We tried all the DVDs in the trilogy and there is no audio during the film, only when you fast forward it. The bonus features do have audio, as well as the menu, but that was not really why we bought it. We tried updating our player to see if that helped, sadly it did not. Hopefully I can return this; we bought it at best buy.
B000F1IQN2|5.0|I first saw the movie when it came out in theaters in December 2005, and was ultimately forgotten by me, until I decided to buy it on DVD two and a half years later and watched it again.  And I found that the movie was highly enjoyable, entertaining, and something that I could easily watch again and again just for the character interaction.<br /><br />Sometimes it seems ridiculous to base politics and beliefs off what is seen in movies, but this wouldn't be the first time it's happened to me; before seeing the movie, I saw Israel as the wrong party in the Middle East, having stolen Palestinian land, and then leeching US assistance in oppressing Palestinians just because they lived in Israel 2,000 years ago.  After this movie, I can't see either side as bad.  It's a conflict beyond black and white whose basest participants are nowhere near anything resembling Stalinist or Hitleresque evil people they are made out to be by their enemies via propaganda or extremist ideology.<br /><br />The opening sequence of the movie is done in amazing fashion that makes you feel as though you are watching the news and hearing about the events unfold in real time with your supportive Muslim family and your tense, frozen-stiff with terror Jewish family, while you also get very beautifully shot and gory scenes of the Black September terrorists breaking into the Israeli athletes' hotel room in Munich, where the fighting and conflict is so well-directed, you feel as if you were one of the Israelis, and that if you just stayed quiet and followed orders, you would make it out alive.<br /><br />What ultimately happens is already well-known, but still hits painfully, and with the simultaneous reading of the Israeli names of the victims on the news with the Palestinian names of those who planned the botched kidnapping listed off by Mossad high command.<br /><br />Every character that is come across in the film is interesting, and has innate chemistry with whomever else they're talking to.  Eric Bana as Avner is perfect in the role, being highly sympathetic even as he is indeed a terrorist.  Ciaran Hinds as Carl plays the father-like figure to Avner and the rest of the group, like a rock holding the makeshift family together.  Daniel Craig as Steve is the quintessential hothead who seems the be the prototypical terrorist in that he is driven purely by hatred for the Palestinians, yet is still well-rounded in that he is a believable, likeable person, without any characteristics that seem wildly out of character for him.  Matheiu Kassovitz as Robert is the makeshift bombmaker, who manages some minor humor that is in no way out of place or inappropriate.<br /><br />Even their enemies in the conflict are keenly humanized without being overly apologetic, from Abdel Wael Zwaiter in Rome, who is clumsily killed while trying to talk and reason with a highly nervous and tense duo of Avner and Robert, Hussein Al Bashir's brief conversation with Avner in the Cyprus hotel balcony before the bomb under his bed blows him up, and nearly kills Avner and two civilians in the process, to Louis's intentionally bunking the four Mossad agents in an old apartment with a group of Palestinians at the same time, the two groups forced to keep their identities and intentions a secret or else risk exposing their plans to the enemy.<br /><br />This sequence also has some lighter, and yet in the broader context most deeply disturbing, moments, such as Steve and a Palestinian silently fighting over what music to play on the radio, before mutually settling on an American station (I forgot what type of music), and Avner arguing Arab/Israeli politics with the Palestinian group's leader, with the Palestinian's conclusion that the reason to fight the Israelis over Palestine is that a home is more important than anything else.<br /><br />Like with most any movie involving a makeshift \\"family\\" between comrades, there's always the series of events that leads to its dissolution, and for viewers like me, a sense of that time being the best time of their lives, and the (survivors') lives afterwards being bleak and emptier without the comradery.  Indeed, even Spielberg said of the character of Avner \\"I don't think he'll ever find peace\\".<br /><br />For the negatives, I think the biggest downpoint of the movie would be the poorly-explained, completely fictional and unimportant French connection involving \\"Louis\\" and his whole amoral spy network of secret information and connections that seemingly works everywhere with everyone from terrorists to first world countries, in a sort of \\"Quantam\\" (\\"Quantam of Solace\\") sort of 'apathetic godly overseer' type role.  While at the very least the conversations had with Avner and the old man (forgot his name) at the head of the family, I didn't find it to be all that necessary, and would have spoken more for Mossad's intelligence capabilities if the information on their targets had come from Mossad instead of from an unnamed, barely known, seemingly unstructured independent French organization with eyes all over the world and no real desire to do anything with it but sell information to the highest bidder.<br /><br />While there are flaws, it's definitely a movie both tragic and enrapturing, grittily shot and realistically depicted, with intense chemistry between virtually everyone involved that makes it worth multiple viewings and owning.e of their lives, and the (survivors') lives afterwards being bleak and emptier without the comradery.

0385338082|5.0|I'm a big fan of Sophie Kinsella's work and have very much enjoyed several of her books. However, this one might be my favorite. I was immediately drawn into the story, laughed heartily throughout Emma's journey, and could hardly stand the suspense during the climax. What a fabulously fun read!
0743496736|4.0|This was my first book by Jodi Picoult but had heard about her writing style.  The subject matter was an extremely difficult one - and then is revealed through the viewpoint of all of the characters - both those that you are rooting for and even the \\"villains,\\" for whom you end up somehow feeling great sympathy.  Very well done and I've gone on to read other books by her as a result.
1596680296|5.0|Ann Budd is simply a genius. Getting Started Knitting Socks is very well written -- great pictures and good descriptions. I was most impressed that the directions were clear enough that I knit my first sock with no outside help or instruction and that it came out beautifully. I highly recommend this book.
0143038419|5.0|Gilbert's self deprecating writing style makes this very heavy journey a very quick and amusing read.  Gilbert had the luxury of spending an entire year focusing on healing herself, physically, mentally and spiritually, which most people will never be able to do.  But her journey reminds us of how important it is to look at where you have been to understand how you got to where you are, and that you need to develop all parts of yourself inside and out, to be truly at peace.
B000068IEU|4.0|\\"The Last House on the Left\\", a Wes Craven DVD movie bearing the MGM DVD label as an Orion Pictures Release, a 1972 production.  ISBN 0-7928-5319-9, DVD -- 1 Hour & 24 minutes in color with sound track & Special Features. Unrated.<br /><br />Falling into a Cult Class of crude horror movies with retribution as a sadistic theme, \\"The Last House on the Left\\" is one such sick chiller-thriller that's a raw, gritty, primitive, nightmarish production that ranks high in the top of \\"snuff\\" cult films that would put Boris Karloff to shame, but reminiscent of the Manson carnages. Excess footage is devoted to progressive death & dying.<br /><br />Premise here is one wherein Mari, a 17-year-old just coming of age, and friend Phyllis plan to attend the rock concert \\"Bloodlust\\" but are diverted. Upon an innocent and misplaced inquiry about getting weed, they are held captive by a quartet of psychopaths who get their joys out of embarrassment, intimidations, and then rape, torture and transportation of the girls to a forested area when they are again raped, tortured and brutally killed in gory and bloodily sceneries that extol bondage, limb severances and evisceration. One girl is left dead in the woods whilst the other is raped and executed by gunshots to the head while fleeing in a swampy pond.  The psychos leave the area and find temporary shelter, unknowingly at first, with Mari's parent's who uncover the plot and retaliate in kind, chain saw and all.<br /><br />Much time is given to futile and sickening chasings in the forest, akin to \\"I Spit on Your Grave\\" footage. The weird, discordant and out of theme background music and the comedic Keystone-like cops dooms the film from ever achieving greatness for horror filming.<br /><br />All along this film was crying out for an enlightened director - and nobody came.  It is so bad that it nearly comes full circle, but in an unenlightened way.  I guess someone was destined to make this wacko sicko film -- Wes Craven took the carrot.
0307265730|5.0|I don't read much fiction. I made an exception to my usual reading fare after watching The Namesake movie a really long time ago. I actually intended to pick up The Namesake, but seeing it was sold out settled on Unaccustomed Earth.    Jhumpa Lahiri can do things with words that I can only dream about. Fiction and non-fiction, I thought this was the best book I read in 2008.    I thought I would dislike short stories. Many times they give too few details and the stories become easily forgotten. These short stories did not disappoint and will certainly not be easily forgotten.

0545128285|3.0|There was a lot of hype behind \\"The Tales of Beedle the Bard,\\" and it was a bit deceiving.  I thought the book would be a bit thicker, that the tales would be a bit longer, but the actual amount of content is a lot closer to that of the [[ASIN:0439321611 Quidditch Through the Ages]] and [[ASIN:0439321603 Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]] books.  Also like those two volumes, this book is entertaining only as a tie-in to the [[ASIN:0545044251 Harry Potter]] series.  While the writing is mostly clever and has a lot of J. K. Rowling's trademark whimsy, the highest function of the book is to make the wizarding world of Harry Potter a bit richer.    The tales themselves are decent, if a bit unremarkable.  The last tale, \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers,\\" is definitely the best, both because of its significance in [[ASIN:0545010225 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]] and because it's such a meaningful story.  A lot of the other tales shoot for the same level of significance, and some (The Wizard and the Hopping Pot) come close, while others (The Warlock's Hairy Heart) did not.  The best part about this volume isn't the tales, however.  J. K. Rowling tapped into the fan favorite character of Albus Dumbledore in her extensive commentary on each tale.  While a lot of it is just the history of the tales, it is an interesting history indeed.  It's great to read so much witty Dumbledore commentary, which is often longer than the tales he's talking about.    While those looking for a book as enthralling as the Harry Potter books will be sorely disappointed, this is a pretty good choice for Potter fans looking for a quick read and some funny Dumbledore anecdotes.    6/10
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|If you are looking for a film that will truly move you and humble you to the global condition and how good we truly have it in comparison to rest of the world, as well as a story with a profound message, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is the film for you.  Not only is the cinematography breathtaking (the realism and graphic imagery is searing), but the acting is amazing and the story is especially relevant to today's global situation (and the timing could not be more on point, considering the recent incident of terrorist violence in Mumbai).<br /><br />SLUMDOG is set in the slums of Mumbai, and follows young street urchin cum game show contestant, Jamal Malik (Dev Patel).  He has the chance to win the big rupee prize on the Indian version of WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE.  No one can believe that he is answering the questions correctly without cheating.  Malik is in love with Latika (Freida Pinto) who has been taken into  a gang members den, to be groomed as a prostitute, with her virginity to be auctioned off to the highest bidder.  They both come from poverty and profound pain.  Life has dealt them damn near impossible cards, and, yet, they keep on going with heads held high in the face of tremendous (and, at times excruciating) adversity.  We see Jamal's evolution from boy to man.  In the end, it is not the promise of money that does that to him.  It is, perhaps, something on a higher plane.<br /><br />I won't divulge any more details here.  You just need to see this film for yourself.  It will quite possibly change your life, the way you view your existence and also the life you are living and how you want to live it, as well as humbling all of us to the great bounty and possibility that exists in this world (regardless of class, caste, culture, ethnicity, religion or way of life).  The slumdog exists in all of us -- the one who has been impoverished, neglected or abused by the world.  See this as soon as you can.
0783240236|5.0|Probably Hitchcock's most famous movie (apart from PSYCHO), THE BIRDS is perhaps best understood as a companion piece to the director's favorite among all his films, SHADOW OF A DOUBT. Like that 1943 thriller, THE BIRDS concerns a visitor to a small town in Northern California bringing evil in his or her wake, which tests the resourcefulness and the compassion of a family that is not so happy as it imagines itself to be. The famous animated special effects (by Disney animator Ub Ewerks) now look a bit silly, but the effect of the music-free \\"score\\" by Bernard Herrmann and Hitchcock's tremendous build-up of suspense make the film one of his greatest among his later and more flawed classics. The acting is at times very unexpected (and thus unlike the flawless performances of Teresa Wright, Joseph Cotten and Patricia Collinge in SHADOW OF A DOUBT), but Rod Taylor is perhaps the most virile leading man Hitchcock ever had, and Jessica Tandy does odd and memorable things with the role of Taylor's neurotic and possessive mother.<br /><br />As for Tippi Hedren, her performance as Melanie Daniels (the unhappy heiress who brings chaos with her to the twon of Bodega Bay, CA) is still one of the most continually debated in all Hitchcock movies, and if at times he seems to be trying to undo her with her camera work (such as the hilarious triptych of shots of her openmouthed, watching the flames head for the gas pump in the diner sequence), it is still impossible at this point to imagine anyone else in the role. Her beautiful green Edith Head coat and gloves which she wears for most of the film are among the most iconic outfits ever created for a film, and there are moments (particularly towards the end of the film, after she's been severely traumatized by a bird attack) when her affective qualities are undeniable.

0446402389|1.0|This is an example of a fascinating idea treated by a writer with little skill and less vision.  The idea of a culture where crime doesn't exist because the state decrees it CAN'T exist is a great starting point, and Leo, the protagonist, is flawed enough to be vaguely interesting.  But as a stylist Smith can't even tie Ludlum's shoes (let alone those of a competent writer) and as a serial killer novel it falls firmly in the bottom half of the genre.        I could go on about his Fiction Writing 101 errors for several pages, so let a few examples suffice.  First, he blatantly steals an idiosyncrasy of Stephen King, taking a word or phrase out of context and italicizing it in a new paragraph before picking up the thread again.  In King's hands this technique is a clever way to reveal the subconscious element of the narrative; when Smith employs it it seems wooden, artificial and self-conscious.  Also, Smith's imagination is limited to the point of confusion--at one point he refers to a footpath by a river that \\"runs both ways\\".  These points may seem picky, but they represent the dominant characteristics of his style--an accumulation of errors and poor writing that constantly distract from the plot.       And then there is the twist, mentioned by several reviewers, an unearned Dickensian moment that made me finally throw the book away in disgust.  If you think Philip Margolin (with his one-black-Ferrari-for-every-ten-pages-of-a-book ratio) is the greatest writer of the last 100 years, then this book is for you.  Otherwise, run.

I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B001HCJAA6|4.0|A great deal is being made of this timely book, given that President-Elect Barack Obama has read it and apparently is using Lincoln's example as a template for shaping his own administration and his own decision making style. And while so far the parallels with the first term of the Lincoln administration are striking, it must be said that Kerns-Goodwin's book makes very clear that for Lincoln, his decision to appoint a \\"team of rivals\\" was no Sunday school picnic: It was a rocky road indeed.<br /><br />Most instructive for the incoming administration it seems to me is that all of Lincoln's appointed rivals thought they were smarter than Lincoln, and took little time in challenging both his authority and decision making abilities. This was especially true of Seward, his Secretary of State, who held Lincoln's abilities just below open contempt, and who thus wasted no time in trying to pre-position himself to establish his authority over Lincoln's emerging Civil war policies. Lincoln spent a lot of his time just trying to countermand Seward's emerging forays into areas well beyond his portfolio. As well, even before the ink was dry he ended up firing two of his cabinet officials.<br /><br />It seems clear that Hillary Clinton has already torn her own page from this book. As she too, like Seward is carefully pre-positioning herself and her staff to takeover in toto the diplomatic aspects of the Obama administration, and also to establish her presence, if not her authority in dealing with the economy as well. Like Seward, this pre-emptive \\"power grab,\\" cannot be what Obama had in mind, and frankly does not bode well for a smoothly meshing foreign policy operation given, Afghanistan, Iraq, and now the explosion again in Israel.<br /><br />Lincoln proved to be no pushover, as he \\"managed\\" Seward's attempts at \\"power-grabbing\\" without alienating him. To his credit, he was able to use the Mafia strategy of \\"keeping your friends close, but keeping your enemies closer\\" and finessed his way through his difficulties with Seward, eventually turning him into one of his favorite and one of his most loyal and effective appointees.<br /><br />However, with Hillary under the tent, and Bill hovering about just outside it, Obama may not be as lucky as Lincoln was in trying to finesse the Hill & Bill problem. I predict that this member of Obama's \\"team of rivals,\\" may not work out as well as that of our sixteenth President, and that Obama will have to jettison her before his first term is up. My own pick for that job was Susan Rice who established her bona fides in the first Clinton administration and was appointed as Ambassador to the UN by Obama. One senses that she and Hillary do not care much for each other. This internecine rivalry too could be a problem for Obama.<br /><br />In any case, while this was a good read, it is not the author's best effort (not even in the same class as the one on Lyndon Johnson). Yet, it could not have been timelier or more instructive for another young green Congressman from Illinois.<br /><br />Four Stars
B000002WU9|4.0|I read a lot of hype (more on the hype later) on this CD for a long time, but had never bought it until December 2008. I think that's an important consideration when rating this CD as I think the artists have evolved (generally becoming better) since then, so I've weighted the rating to account for this.    Some of the track highlights include:  Knuckleheads - While the beat and lyrics feel a bit dated, it's a pretty decent jam.  Criminology - Should have found a way to carry the chorus' wailing horns through the entire song. Other than that, the track is ok.  Rainy Dayz - The best track on the CD. Relevant and smooth even today. One of Rza's best beats ever. And that's sayin' something...  Guillotine Swordz - \\"A poisonous Rebel like Deck, you can't avoid this.\\" Rebel INS my favorite Wu rapper, how can I not like this jam?!  Spot Rusherz - Classic Wu sound, well done.  Ice Cream - This Ice Cream is better than Haggen Daz or Ben & Jerry's.  Wu-Gambino's - Second best track on the CD. The Wu family come together to lay lyrics to an instant Wu-Tang classic.    I've read that this is one of the best CD solo albums released by the Wu-Tang Clan. Well, maybe when it was released it was (there was only one or two others prior to Cuban Linx, right?), but I think that is very arguable today. There have been a lot of solid releases since Cuban Linx. Still, I think it merits its high praise and hype - this CD doesn't disappoint.
B000H0SW58|3.0|Please be aware that this is a pirated release. The people who are charging the exhorbitant amount of money here for these discs are cheating you. This show is freely traded among Pink Floyd fans, and is available on several Bit-Torrent sites such as Pirate's Bay and Demonoid for free download.<br /><br />That said, this is a somewhat watchable show. The sound could be better. It was originally professionally shot with multiple video cameras, but Mr. Waters and Co. determined that it was \\"too dark\\", and that's a fair statement; like a lot of rock shows, it needed to have the lighting redesigned to properly film it with video cameras. Contrasts are too high, too much spotlight, and not enough back-light. Mr. Waters learned from this, and you can see it on \\"The Wall: Live In Berlin\\" where he (at least) got that aspect of the show right. This DVD is sourced from a several generations old videotape, and has some artifacts from those generations and transfer. I'd avoid it at this price-- you're bound to be disappointed from your preconcieved expectations. Better to download it for free.

B00000099Y|5.0|Some how for some reason, this was the last Tool album to complete my collection... Don't ask me why... I've listed to \\"Aenima\\" 4 times now, but already I find it lives up to the hype surrounding it, just like \\"Lateralus\\" did. For newcomers: This is a GREAT Tool album to start with because it contains some of the best elements of Tool: the dark, gritty and somewhat bitterly juvenile \\"Undertow\\" as well as Tool's complex though provoking magnum opus that is \\"Lateralus\\". But beware, this isn't your typical hard rock/ metal album, like other reviewers will tell you, it takes time and attention... be prepared to set aside enough time to listen to this record in it's entirety and probably not like it. You'll be rewarded though as your brain starts to sort things out and piece parts together... which is the best way I can describe it. It's just structured so differently than anything else one typically hears from popular rock groups... To be honest, I fell asleep halfway through during my second listen to \\"Aenima\\", but on the 4th listen, It hit me, and I was rockin this album just completely enthralled by it... On \\"Lateralus\\" it took me like 10+ listens to fully appreciate it, but when it finally hit me... WOW. Anyways, again, this would be an excellent place to start in my opinion... It contributed to Tool's amazing evolution. \\"Aenema\\" IS Tool's first progressive metal masterpiece.
0375826726|2.0|The first book was a decent book.  The second had some issues.  There were points of interest, and some clever bits in this third book, but as a novel, it was crap.  First, far too much superfolous prose.  This book could have easily come in under 500 pages and been better.  Second, what character or story *really* progressed in this book that made it worth 700 pages?  Lastly, it ended without resolution, to be frank, and left me wondering if I can handle another 700+ pages in the follow-up.    I don't think this should or will keep you from reading this book, if you have already invested emotionally in the characters or story, like me, but its disappointing that the authors arc started so high and has come down with each release.  I have to admit, as I was reading this, I thought this was a trilogy, so I was going to get a conclusion, but as it neared the end, I realized this was not going to be the case.    I hope the author is saving up the goods for the finale.  This was very unsatisfying.

B000TUXL2A|2.0|Just keeping this short and sweet, this CD is really void of any energy. Sure there may be a track of two with catchy chord progressions, but realistically, it's quite boring. I am a big fan of MK's music, and especially his guitar playing ability, but this CD just doesn't work for me, and, it won't be one that I grab for long road trips.    Half the time, I don't have a clue as to what Mark is singing about as his voice is muddled and trails off. This is part of the \\"energy\\" that is simply missing, both in his singing and his playing. I kinda get the feeling that MK just doesn't care anymore. (On the very first track I was reaching for the controls trying to boost treble, but for some reason, it is not \\"crisp\\"....what's up with that? Sounds like he recorded it in his living room). I'd pass on this CD.
0525478183|4.0|I'm finding it impossible to rate this one. My feelings about it are completely mixed. I've read nothing but shining reviews for this one so it had a lot to live up to and I'm not sure it did. On the other hand, it was definitely an interesting read.    Paper Towns starts off with young Margo and Quentin finding a dead body. Then you fast forward a few years to their senior year. They're still neighbors but in completely different cliques. Until Margo climbs back through Quentin's window and demands they go for an adventure. At the end of the night, Quentin is sure things will have changed by morning. And they have, but not really for the better. Margo is gone. But she's left a trail of clues. Or so he thinks.    It sounds really exciting and I guess it is. I loved the whole midnight adventure part. But, after that, there was nothing that really kept me intrigued. Sure, I wanted to know what was going to happen to the characters but not to the point where I couldn't put the book down. Everything just seemed so dry and bland. Probably about 50% of the book was all about Quentin worrying about Margo. So, while I was reading the book, I didn't think it was all that special.    Fastforward a few hours after I've finished the book. I'm on the computer, chatting with my friends, when I go \\"Holy crap\\" and start thinking about the book. Then I realized I loved it. I can't say what it was. But this book, as a whole, affected me. There was a raw truthfulness about the paper people in paper towns and how while they weren't always real, the memories were. That just really struck home with me.    So I can't really grade this book because as I was reading it, I really thought it kind of sucked. I still feel no attachment to the characters but looking back on the story as a whole, it still wasn't what I expected but there was definitely something about it that would make me recommend it
0143038583|5.0|This book is a life changer. A must read for every American, in my opinion.
0142412147|4.0|I...well, to be honest, I didn't like this anywhere near as much as I was expecting. That's not to say it wasn't GOOD but I was expecting something that would blow me away. And this was not it. I've decided that since if the first book I've reviewed with multiple authors, I'm going to take each story separately.     Jubilee Express by Maureen Johnson - This story and this story alone is what kept me from giving this book a lower grade. MJ has been a favorite author of mine for quite some time and she definitely does not disappoint. The story itself is definitely the most original of the three and the characters are incredibly well developed, probably moreso than you'd expect for a story this short. The relationships seemed so real and even though certain things seemed unlikely, it was impossible to put the book down.     A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle by John Green - Surprisingly, this was the story I expected to like most but ended up liking least. It wasn't very original, I had the ending predicted half way through the story, and the characters seemed to fall slightly flat. The one thing I did love, though, was the prose. I loved the slang and descriptions used. Unfortunately, I think I was expecting more from Green, after hearing so many fabulous things about his writing. I can only hope his regular novels are better.     Patron Saint of Pigs by Lauren Myracle - Lauren Myracle is absolutely fabulous. Her humor and craziness are just to be adored and they definitely show through her writing. Patron Saint of Pigs is a ridiculously cute story. Yes, the characters weren't very well developed and the plot was slightly predictable but the story is just so ridiculously cute.     So do I recommend this or not? Definitely but just don't expect the stories to blow you out of your seat
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is a fabulous movie.  You don't need any qualifiers for it being animated, a robot movie, or anything else.  It is simply a terrific movie.  The story opens in a desolated city where a lonely little trash compacting robot (WALL-E) simply does the work he was created to do.  All his peers seem to have broken down long ago and he uses their remains for spare parts.  His only companion is a lone cockroach (one of the elements of the movie that requires the greatest suspension of disbelief - that is that there would only be ONE cockroach).  The scene is interrupted by a spaceship that drops off a sleek looking robot of immense power that seems to be looking for something in a rather fierce and impatient way.  WALL-E becomes enamored of EVE, but EVE is focused on her mission and it doesn't include WALL-E.  That is until WALL-E shows her a single green plant that he has found.  The rest of the story takes off from there and heads out into space.  You will have to see the movie to get the rest of the story.<br /><br />This first part of the movie uses very few words and yet we understand everything that is going on and become very emotionally involved with the characters and their situations.  I think that is quite an achievement and those who pulled it off deserve great praise.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is also very good and has some interesting things to say while it entertains us.  Just to cite one example, there is a little robot whose job it is to clean up every foreign contaminant it comes across, but it also has to follow its lighted path through the ship as every robot does.  However, WALL-E's dirty tread leaves foreign contaminant's wherever he goes and he doesn't follow any lines.  At one critical moment the little cleaning robot must choose between its purpose to clean and its directive to stay on the lighted path.  Its choice is instructive, I think and one which we all face at different points in our life.<br /><br />A fine family film, but has as much for adults as it does for kids.  A memorable film that I think will last.<br /><br />Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MIt does for kids.  A memorable film that I think will last.    Reviewed by Craig Matteson, Ann Arbor, MI
B000G8NY4U|5.0|This has to be the best of the 3 concerts Yanni has released.  It is, in one word, EXCITING!  If you can watch this sitting still, frankly your body temperature must be somewhat subpar.  Some of the pieces are repeats from prior concerts, but are far more refined versions.  Yanni's newer pieces are STUNNINGLY INFECTIOUS.  Not only are the compositions rich with concentrated fun and elevated tempo, the perfomers are in every sense world class.    The performers, in his words, \\"bring Beauty, Strength, and Color\\" to his music.  Quite apparently they have the latitude to add in their individual character, rather than merely following a score.  It is interesting to watch Yanni connecting with them with gesturings throughout.  It is interesting to watch the obvious JOY in their faces while giving their all.  It is also interesting to find that same joy in the faces of the audience.
074325144X|5.0|I've been running for 4 years and have been prone to injury, IT Band and now, plantar fasciitis(the past 8 months).  I remember reading an article several years ago in Runners World magazine on Chirunning and it gave me the impression of being \\"Cultish\\" and I just didn't buy it.  Having finished 2 marathons(walking or crawling due to injury) and with my latest injury, I read in Dean Karnazes latest book how he will often lean forward(or backwards) to use different muscles.  I remembered Chirunning and how it says it will reduce injuries.  being a skeptic and desperate, I tried the Chi.  Perhaps because I already had a short stride and schuffle, I found instant results and found it natural.  My quads which were recently hurting on long runs, were gone.  I was feeling better after the runs than previously.  Less recovery time.  And the icing on the cake, all my different training runs were new PR's, without seemingly anymore effort. I took 7 minutes off my best 1/2 after only starting Chi for 2 1/2 weeks.  Although my plantar fasciitis is sticking around(it does feel better) my body has never felt better, which is the most important thing.  The speed is a nice bonus!  Regarding the book, like many have said, it could be condensed, but I love the author's passion and highly recommend the book or at least give it a try.  I went from being a very frustrated runner to a happy runner:)
1439102813|4.0|You would think that maybe only those whose lives have been touched by Alzheimer's disease would have an interest in this book, but I found that not to be true.  I've been fortunate so far and no one I am close to has suffered the ravages of the disease, but I found this book moving, interesting and unsettling.  Unsettling because none of us know who in our family will suffer from Alzheimer's disease until it hits us.  Disturbing because we don't really know if we lose our keys, or misplace an item, or forget a meeting if it is just a natural occurrence in a busy life or the onset of dementia.<br /><br />How does one beginning to have signs of Alzheimer's disease feel?  How does it feel to hear the words from a doctor that you've been diagnosed with the disease?  How do you tell family members?  How might they react?  All questions that can not be answered unless you've walked in the shoes of an Alzheimer's patient or are very familiar with those who have.<br /><br />First time author Lisa Genova is an online columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association and holds a Ph.D. in neuroscience.  She knows about her chosen subject.  Not only is this novel informative, it is touching.  I was able - for the time it took to read the 300 plus pages - to get inside the skin of Alice Howland, the Harvard professor of cognitive psychology who is also a world-renowned expert in linguistics.<br /><br />Alice's husband is also a Harvard professor; they have three grown children and a life many would envy.  But Alice begins to notice problems with her memory and the cursory excuses/diagnosis of lack of sleep, menopause or being overly stressed and busy just don't explain her symptoms.  So, she digs deeper and finds the cause; one she wishes she hadn't.<br /><br />Still Alice held my interest from the first page to the last (and then I wanted more), because I liked Alice.  Reactions of her loved ones seemed real.  I could feel Alice's frustration, sadness and fear.  Still Alice is a well-written novel that is educational as well as entertaining.educational as well as entertaining.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I'm 32, loved the books and actually enjoyed this soundtrack. I WAS disappointed that the music from the movie trailers was missing - I had to find those online and download them for my own enjoyment. Bella's Lullaby was a beautiful piece but I have to agree, not at ALL what I was expecting! Too much instrumental 'noise' from the orchestra in the background and I can't figure out how in the world Edward would have hummed that piece (it was so complicated) with any chance of lulling poor Bella (or anyone) to sleep at night!<br /><br />The tunes are definitely alternative and hip - but I don't believe them to be meant for the teen generation. Paramore is a fantastic group with a strong lead singer, Rob Pattison's piece was simple and beautiful (if you can't understand his lyrics, you're just not used to the Brit accent, but it definitely fit the theme of the story IMHO). Muse - SMeyer raves about and is definitely upbeat.

B00005R2M3|5.0|With all due respect, Ms. Arnold couldn't be more wrong.  Voices don't come with much more power, control, or range than Shakira. Absolutely incredible vibrato.  I'd suggest you listen to more than \\"Laundry Service\\" before making such judgements.  She can make sounds with her voice you'll swear came from a synthesizer.  And she makes the same sounds live as well - this isn't studio gloss.   Quite and gentle as mouse or roaring like a lion.  From low and guttural like \\"Se Quiere, Se Mata\\" to high and loud like \\"Your Embace\\".  And styles all over the place as well.  Try \\"Obtener Un Si\\" or \\"Illegal\\" for some laid-back Smooth Jazz listening or \\"Poem to a Horse\\" for some in your face rock-n-roll.  Or try \\"Hay Amores\\" and \\"Despedida\\" for a South American Folk sound (two she wrote and performed for a movie sound track - Love in the Time of Cholera).  Shakira is not new.  She started in the business before she was a teen-ager and her first two albums (Magia [Magic] and Peligro [Danger]) were released only in Columbia.  She also did some acting on a Columbian Soap Opera.  And by-the-way, she has produced every one of her own albums and was the #4 Female money maker in 2008.  This amazing Singer, Song Writer, Composer, Musician, Dancer, Choreographer, Producer and philanthropist will be around for a long time to come.  Being drop dead sexy won't hurt her career any either.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|Beautifully animated and rich with meaning, `Kung Fu Panda' is a surefire crowd pleaser and, well, a whole lot of fun.  Pairing crisp imagery with some sublime voice over actors, `Kung Fu Panda' is as entertaining as the trailers would suggest and definitely deserves a spot as one of the best animated films of the year.<br /><br />The film tells the story of Po, a Panda who dreams of one day achieving Kung Fu awesomeness.  The only problem is that he comes from a long line of noodle makers and his father just doesn't understand his desire to fight.  When word comes that the evil kung fu master Tai Lung may escape imprisonment it is time to name the Dragon Warrior, a kung fu master who will receive the dragon scroll and all its endless power.  The ceremony is held and it is believed that one of the furious five (Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane and Viper) will be named the Dragon Warrior, but not all is as it seems and Po is named the warrior.  Kung Fu master Shifu must train Po in order for him to defeat Tai Lung.<br /><br />The storyline is simple enough for children to grasp yet not too dulled down to the point where parents are bored stiff.  The action keeps coming and the hilarity rarely lets up, and the message about believing in oneself is very strong and very enlightening, especially for children.<br /><br />I will give a word of caution, and beings that this is a film targeted towards the young ones I feel that this `warning' is valid and justified.  The film is filled with kung fu violence.  Now yes, I understand that a lot of cartoons have violence within them, and I normally am not one to balk at all, but there is a slight difference (is it really slight?) between stylized comical violence and intentional dark violence.  Tai Lung is an evil soul and the fight scenes between him and the furious five or him and Shifu are quite violent and not comical (his fight with Po is rather funny).  His escape from the prison is rather violent as well.  The point being that, while a film like `The Incredibles' is violent, it is a comical kind of violence (the villain in that film is funny in itself) but the violence here is darker and may not be something you want your children imitating.  Just a word of caution to parents, since being a parent I appreciate those words myself.<br /><br />Anyways, I really like this movie, and I think that most parents and children will too.  Just know your kids first, that's all I say.  It's entertaining and action packed and funny to boot.  Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman make a great team here.The Incredibles' is violent, it is a comical kind of violence (the villain in that film is funny in itself) but the violence here is darker and may not be something you want your children imitating.

B00001OH82|3.0|The thing about Tin Machine is this: it's not a David Bowie project. It's a band for which Mr. Bowie sings and generally contributes as any band member contributes to his or her collective. The guitars on this album are insanely good; they are versatile, innovative and unrelenting. The drums are punk without being overly 4/4 (over simplistic and repetitive). That bass NEVER stays still, never looses the groove and is out-thinking you before you start. Lastly, The vox here are literate, snarlish, crooning and cool. Clearly the singer has something to prove about having nothing to prove.     All in all these songs are excellently conceived, skillfully executed and musically fulfilling.    The drawback is the mix. It seems that the band was so interested in the big power-rock sound that the vox got crushed and the nuance of some of the playing is almost lost. Consequently the record is more raw sounding than sophisticated when it would be most accurately mixed as both.    Don't be fooled by the high profile of the frontman. If this record were made when it was made and Bowie wasn't already famous it would have almost surely garnered a cult following larger than it already has and made a deeper impact as being as ahead of it's time as it actually was. But, y'know, that didn't happen.    The best abstract phrase I can think up to describe both the music and the musicians that created it is this: balls the size of thunderclouds.    You just have to listen past the clumsy mix.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|What's not to like?<br /><br />The singing is spotty, the musical numbers are all over the place, the little girl is highly annoying, the film is borderline preposterous and Albert Finney looks bored but we never are (bored that is).  The great thing about `Annie' is that no matter how bad it really is you can't help but like it.  I've seen this movie a hundred times (granted I was very little for the majority of them) and I could watch it again tomorrow (bet you're bottom dollar).<br /><br />There are a few versions of this classic story, but this one is my favorite (even if it is the worst as many claim).  It's the one I grew up on so maybe I'm a tad biased, but whatever, I enjoy it immensely.<br /><br />The film tells the story of orphan Annie who escapes the clutches of the evil Miss Hannigan when billionaire Oliver Warbucks decides to let an orphan live with him in his mansion for a week; and Annie is that orphan.  After a week of fun and games (and singing and dancing) Oliver decides (with a little prodding from the lovely Grace) to adopt Annie, but there is a problem.  Annie is waiting for her mother and father to come back for her, and so Warbucks decides to help her in every way he can to find her parents.  What Hannigan and her evil brother Rooster have in store for Annie (and Warbucks) is another story all together.<br /><br />Okay, so like I said, the singing is spotty (Finney, I love you but really?) and the dance numbers are somewhat spastic (some are great, some are ridiculous) but it all works and it is all entertaining, no doubt.  Little Aileen Quinn is an annoying little child and a really bad actress but she can sing (if that really was her) and her renditions of `Tomorrow' and the like are really nicely done.  Albert Finney, like I said, is bored.  He yells a lot and sings out of key but I just love him.  Really, the best thing about this movie is Carol Burnett who is all sorts of hilarious in this movie.  She give Hannigan the right balance of well intentioned cruelty to make her a character you love to hate.<br /><br />I will say that some of this movie is far from appropriate for children, especially when Tim Curry and Bernadette Peters (I love her here too) are on the screen (they tend to get rather risqu&eacute;) and there is some language that I didn't remember but all in all it is something that your children will love (my daughter, too young to really pay attention, was captivated by the singing).<br /><br />Embrace it for all its faults and relish in the campy qualities it possesses.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is a small but very useful electric vacuum cleaner that is designed to handle less extreme messes with little effort. The majority of the messes experienced in most households are small in size, but frequent in number. This is precisely why the Swivel Sweeper is so useful. It tackles small jobs with ease and it packs a greater punch than most other vacuums of similar size.<br /><br />The Swivel Sweeper offers many reasons to recommend it, but the main reason this vacuum is superior to others is its cleaning head. It features brushes on all sides. Even large, heavy duty vacuum cleaners do not have brushes on every side of the vacuum head. Swivel Sweeper has them everywhere and they rotate a full 360 degrees. Thus, no matter how you turn the head, the crumbs and other waste will get sucked into the vacuum. There is no second effort needed.<br /><br />Since the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is intended for smaller jobs and since it isn't very large, it obviously doesn't have much storage space for the dust and other particles it picks up from the floor. This means it requires more frequent emptying of the waste container. It is a pretty easy process, given that the receptacle is hinged. All you do is push the inner red tabs to dump the contents. Once the contents are emptied, you just snap it shut and the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is ready for its next use. This will have to be done frequently because the container is so small, but at least the process is simple and doesn't require purchasing disposable bags.<br /><br />The Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is great for cleaning up messes on tile or hardwood floors, but I have noticed that its use is limited on carpets. Even on a very flat carpet, the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner seems to be doing all it can to operate, and you will quickly notice a deepening and slowing in the sound as the brushes spin their wheels, trying to eliminate particles from your favorite rugs. The vacuum becomes a tad lethargic on carpets and has limited usefulness in this capacity. The power will be lost more quickly and a single charge will not last very long. One thing you should not use the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner on is shag carpeting. Very few people go shag nowadays, but if you are one of the few who owns shag, do not use this vacuum on your carpet. It will not be able to dig deeply enough to clean the carpet the way it should be cleaned.<br /><br />One nice safety device with the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is its auto- shutoff. If you attempt to pick up something that is too large or too stringy and it causes the brushes to stop turning, the vacuum will automatically shut off. This is good, because it means the motor will not burn out and the charge will not be exhausted too quickly. I have had this experience when I tried to pick up some string. It was longer than I estimated and it got stuck. I had to pull the string out manually, but the vacuum stopped immediately, so there was no damage done to the motor.<br /><br />Taken as a whole, the Cordless Swivel Sweeper mini- vacuum cleaner is a very good little vacuum cleaner that offers greater capabilities than other sweepers of its size and style. It can't replace the large, more powerful vacuum cleaners, but it wasn't intended for large scale use. It is intended for small jobs and among the vacuums in its class, it ranks as one of the best around.s, trying to eliminate particles from your favorite rugs.

It can't replace the large, more powerful vacuum cleaners, but it wasn't intended for large scale use. It is intended for small jobs and among the vacuums in its class, it ranks as one of the best around.
0439023483|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good novel. It had an interesting plot, a love triangle, and a lot of action so you do not get bored. The book has no cussing(that I remember) and it does have some intimate moments between the lead female and male but nothing too racy (its a lot milder than anything on tv). I kind of saw the end coming but it did not effect my enjoyment of the book. The only problem I had was the cliff hanger at the end. I would have liked a little more closure than what the author gave us. It felt like the publisher forgot to put in the last couple of chapters. But overall it was an engrossing read and I recommend this book to anyone over the age of thirteen or fourteen.

0198326769|5.0|I just read this book after my 13 year old daughter finished it. It was a well told, very readable story. While it doesn't go into great detail about the Holocaust(which made it more readable for children), I think it is very thought provoking for them. It was a book that neither my daughter nor I could put down. You definitely go on this \\"journey\\" with the 2 main characters, and become emotionally involved with them. It is absolutely worth reading, but it does leave out all the details of what actually did go on in the concentration camps.
B00007BKVC|5.0|That would be me watching this movie.  Because I didn't attempt to see it through some ideological filter.  Of course it's not a \\"feminist\\" tract - bear in mind that that's merely how some PR types tried to market it.  Which goes to show how absurd marketing is.  If it's anything even remotely relating to \\"feminism,\\" it's a cautionary tale advising women not to leap blindly into something they don't understand.  But of course it's not about that either.  It's a movie about two women who make a series of disastrous choices that literally brings them to the edge of a cliff with nowhere to go but over. It's also a movie that shows the dark side of \\"freedom.\\"  Yes, Thelma and Louise attain a level of carefree freedom most people will never experience.  And they pay a terrible price for it.  And it's a movie about contrasts, showing men as callous users (via the Brad Pitt character) and also as caring helpers (via the Harvey Keitel character). But above all else, it's a movie about two humans getting caught up in a maddening spiral of events that have taken on a life of their own - a perfect parable for what's happening all over the world, day in and day out. You set something in motion and from that moment on it's beyond your control.  Thelma and Louise's only \\"triumph\\" is their acknowledgment that they have done this to themselves.  They don't say so of course; but their final action says it for them.  In that sense, this movie bears some resemblance to one of my other nominees for greatest movie of all time - The Bridge on the River Kwai, wherein the Alec Guiness character finally realizes his great mistake; but realizes it too late to save himself.  Just like Thelma and Louise.
0061122416|1.0|There isn't anything in this book that you couldn't get from the output of any number of self-help \\"gurus\\".  First, the author couldn't even just have a plot being about following one's dream, calling, etc; it had to be one's \\"Personal Legend\\" (complete with initial caps).  Second, the metaphysics doesn't have anything that one couldn't get from Obi-Wan Kenobi's take on the Force.  Third, the characters are one-dimensional.  One doesn't get the sense of the shepherd being driven by something, despite the fact that his leaving the seminary in order to herd sheep is motivated by wanderlust.  Finally, the plot itself is contrived at many points.  For example, the idea of a former seminary student and shepherd making a success of himself as a merchant.

Of course it would get lower ratings.<br /><br />For me, however, this book was just what I was waiting for.<br /><br />Like Stephanie Meyer herself, I, too, was often annoyed with Bella.  Who says in one breath that she wants to spend eternity with someone then in the very next sentence scoffs at the suggestion of marrying that very same man?  Is she INSANE?  I was pleased with her transformation.  She was more confident, more sure of the decisions she had made and would continue to make, more rational.<br /><br />I was pleased to see that there were no explicit sex scenes to weed through, as well.  I have a very good imagination and I was perfectly capable of filling in the blanks for myself, thank you very much.

B000AP04OM|5.0|Now I've owned this movie on VHS for years and years and enjoyed it so much so when I decided to convert it to DVD and it didn't work because of some copyright encoding I was really upset.  I went to Amazon.com to find myself a replacement and lo and behold, here was the 40th Anniversary edition of The Sound of Music. Sold!  This has been remastered and is in surround sound. The first time I watched it I was blown away. I caught details in the film that I didn't even know were there! It was amazing!  The special features are almost more interesting than the movie itself! Interviews with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer and the actors who played the 7 children, even a tour with one of the actors to visit all of the filming locations and showing the history behind it all. I was captivated.  This is a timeless classic that you and your children and your grandchildren will enjoy over and over.

B001AQR39O|3.0|Season 1 was absolutely amazing, the best show on TV as far as I am concerned. The second season focused too much on trying to be funny, or a knock-off of Weeds. Unfortunately it missed the mark. However, it has some amazing moment mixed in with the goofy writing - especially towards the end that make owning Season 2 worthwhile. I can't wait for season 3, hopefully they listen to the fans and bring it back to what we love so much!

1591841666|3.0|\\"This book is really short.  Short books are hard to write, but you made me do it.  My readers are excellent correspondents, and this is something I've learned from them along the way:  Write less.\\"  --Seth Godin<br /><br />Damn straight.  This book is an exercise in brevity.  I often recommend that readers preview a key chapter before deciding whether to commit to a book.  No need with this one--just take an extra 20 minutes and read the whole thing.  Borrow it instead of buying it; the key points will stick with you.<br /><br />Godin's points are straightforward:<br /><br />* Comes a time in doing anything when it gets hard and stops being fun.<br />* If it is something you can be the best at, stick with it through the \\"dip.\\"<br />* If it isn't something you can excel at, quit.  And excel at something else.<br />* Learn to recognize such \\"cul-de-sacs\\" and avoid even starting such paths.<br />* Endlessly coping without either excelling or quitting is a trap.<br />* Systems are designed to exploit \\"copers\\" in various ways.  Beware.<br />* There are eight common causes of \\"dips.\\"  Beware some more.<br /><br />That's pretty much it.  There are some good stories about Vince Lumbardi, Butch Cassidy, the space shuttle, and Microsoft.  But they build on the main points.  There is good advice here.  It would be worth your time, even if it were longer.
031606792X|5.0|I have become obsessed with these books with each being better than the one before. The only thing that is bad about this book is it is the last one in the series. I want to go on in life with Bella and her new found family forever. I was thrilled with how everything worked out in Breaking Dawn. I can only hope Stephanie Myer decides to write #5 maybe one about Renesemee!!
B00011F5DK|5.0|I got this game for my twelve year old grandson for Christmas '08. He didn't seem too excited when he opened it.  We started to play it the next day, not only did he love it but my daughter age 30 loved it and my husband and I in our sixties loved it.  We played it 3 times a day for 4 days straight.  We would still be playing it but we had to go back to our home town 5 hours away. It is very educational.  It teaches you how to think ahead and spacial relationships.  It is very easy to learn and a game only takes about 30-45 minutes.  I highly recommend this game.
0307388840|4.0|McEwan's writing style is definitely an acquired taste--there are times when it seems like he is overwriting the novel, and we are drumming through as a reader to try to extract the next available plot event. It took me a few chapters to get moving more rapidly with the reading, but ultimately it was rewarding. While the novel does take awhile to get going, the story picks up steam towards the second half. McEwan has an ability to illustrate and pinpoint detail with great vividness, and that goes a long way in creating believable characters, and successfully moving back and forth in time.     ** Warning: Spoilers and plot summary ahead, skip to next paragraph if you haven't read book**     Basically the novel is divided into four main parts. Part one begins with young Briony writing a play and awaiting her cousins as well as her brother's arrival. Briony witnesses a moment of flirting between her sister and Robbie at the fountain and then, after reading a \\"dirty\\" letter intended for Cecilia, misconstrues Robbie as being some sort of \\"monster\\". Later, while both families are out searching for her twin cousins who have run off, she witnesses her cousin Lola apparently being molested by a man. Putting all she has seen--and read-- together, she comes to the conclusion that the man must have been Robbie. Unwavering in her testimony, Briony is the one who sends Robbie off to prison despite his protests. Part two fast forwards a few years where we are given a first-hand account of Robbie's role in the war. He and his comrades encounter many grizzly deaths, and witness first-hand how brutality of battle can strip away the spirit of individuals, both physically and mentally. Robbie keeps Cecelia's note to \\"come back\\"  to her as comfort and motivation to survive. Cecilia had been the only one of the Tallis family who had believed in his innocence.  Part three takes the story at the same time from Briony's point of view. Living with her sin, she is now working relentlesslyas a probationer in a hospital helping out fallen and injured soldiers during wartime. Much like Robbie, Briony has had her freedoms stripped from her, only she has done it of her own accord. Briony's work is a form of atonement, as she also sees war's brutal and graphic results, and tries to comfort and tend to the severely injured and the dying. Having written and not heard from her sister Cecilia, she decides one day to go out and find her sister's place. After seeing her sister, she learns that Robbie is there also, and he confronts Briony about the past, telling her that there is one thing she must do to \\"atone\\" for her past:  tell everyone what the truth is. Briony leaves, apparently agreeing to do this. From here, part four fast forwards to an elderly Briony's point of view. She has gone to her doctor, and realizes that the headaches she has are an early sign of dementia. She only has a short amount of time before this condition will ultimately rob her of her mind, her thoughts, her identity and her life. Despite hearing this news, she is upbeat as she returns home, and gets there to witness many of the young grandchildren perform her childhood play, \\"The Trials of Arabella.\\" It is significant because this play takes her back to the past, of that fateful day where she made her mistake. She has been a successful writer, but there is one book that never got published and that has gone through many different drafts. It is basically the story of Robbie and Cecilia, and the mistake she made to ruin their love. She tells us that the book has two different endings--one where Robbie and Cecilia live happily ever after, and the other one, in which Robbie and Cecilia both die in 1940. She chooses the first ending because as she puts it \\"Who would want to believe that they never met again, never fulfilled their love?\\" She reflects on whether she has atoned for her sin or not.     One significant issue taken from McEwan's novel is the idea of forgiveness. As the novel progresses, not only is Briony coming to terms with what her lie does to the fates of her sister and Robbie, but herself as well. We wonder whether they should forgive her for this, or what acts of retribution make up for a moment of sin. There is a sense that, although Briony is young when making her poor decision, that once her statement is taken down by the police, the fate of the three main characters are all sealed, and that they must all pay for years to come. Briony makes her form of redemption by working tirelessly during the war, and there is a sense by novel's end that McEwan wants us to forgive, or at least be sympathetic to, Briony. This seems especially true since the last two parts of the novel are taken from her point of view. However it is, it begs to the ultimate question at the end: Do WE forgive Briony?     It is easy to see how this novel was turned into a film up for an award last year, because the scenery and moments \\"come to life\\" in McEwan's writing. As far as reading, I would recommend this novel, but do so with the advice that it might take you more than one try to get through, but that it will ultimately pay off. I watched the film first before reading, but now am anxious to go back and watch the film again.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Taylor's second CD is awesome. I think she is an amazing songwriter, especially for being so young. Every song on this CD is singable and fun to listen to. I think if she plays her cards right, she will have an amazing career.
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|This was a pretty entertaining movie. The story line was unique and action packed. Some of the scenes were a little far-fetched only in hollywood stuff, but that gave this movie its own feeling. The ending was surprising, but that also made this movie its own. I was happy with this movie and its excitement and action and I think it's a should buy.
B000003BDJ|5.0|Too much has been written about the Rolling Stones and their music for me to add anything worthwhile other than to rave about this CD as the perfect starter-set for the casual music fan.  (A serious fan will have all the Stones' albums, or at least the stuff prior to 1975.)    If you or someone you love only has room in the budget for a slice of the Stones, this is the one for you - 21 classic tracks from the apex of the band's creative boom.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I liked this movie. It's one of the better Pixar releases. It was very entertaining almost all the way through. The story drifted 2/3 of the way in the movie, but it was still fun to watch. Wall-e is a lovable robot and both children and adults will enjoy watching him. My review is on the single-disc edition.
B000EWBKKI|2.0|Are you wondering why the price of the Blu-ray version is too good to be true? It's because this is only an average production. This incredible movie deserves much better. The picture and audio are just average (by Blu-ray standards, that is).    T2 is a BD-25 (half-size) Blu-ray disc and contains no lossless audio track. In other words, it doesn't come close to exploiting the capabilities of the Blu-ray format, so why bother?    Save your ten dollars, and wait for the \\"remastered\\" Blu-ray version that I'm quite sure will be released in the future. I'm sure it will contain a better image as well as a real, uncompressed audio track. This is similar to what happened with The Fifth Element: The first Blu-ray version of the movie was terrible, and was followed up by a remastered version. Embarrassing to say the least.    Note that I am rating the Blu-ray edition of this movie and its shortcomings. I'm frustrated that it's barely an improvement over some of the excellent DVD versions available.     One of the best action movies ever deserves to be a \\"reference\\" quality production that you would use to show off your home theater, but instead it falls far short.    The movie itself is of course awesome.
B001DPHDCY|3.0|As an adult I had mixed feelings about this release. The CGI was was fair to good and it was somewhat of an entertaining movie , but it was too long for a Seuss movie. They dragged the story on-and-on but once again I am an adult now, a child would probably love this title. I think this is a for sure to-rent title. If you have young-ones around the house, maybe you should go ahead and buy, they will probably want to watch it over-and-over again.
B001C08RHA|1.0|Now before I get into it, this is not a review of either DVD or its features. I saw this movie for $4 via Charter On Demand- and it was worth exactly that. Also, don't take everything I say too seriously. There's no need to start lighting fires over a few words I wrote in only a couple of minutes.    To be blunt, Iron man is a mindless, over-hyped action film which survives solely on A-list actors and admittedly spectacular special effects. Want a quick movie to get your adrenaline rushing? Go ahead and pick it up. But if you're expecting a movie thats...good? Save your money and look elsewhere. Iron Man is what it is: another one of Marvel's half-hearted attempts to make a quick buck, still drunk with visions of grandeur roughly five years after the success of Sam Raimi's film adaptation of Spider-Man. A generic, simple plot is only made more repugnant by an odd air of 9/11 paranoia which, albeit inconsequential, seems to be omnipresent throughout the film. Of course, this plays off-of the typical liberties taken with the original comic book's plot.    I've seen a lot of stupid movies in my day, but at least they had lower budgets which usually warranted some creativity. The fact this pile of celluloid fecal matter is so highly regarded would make Darwin roll over in his grave.
B0015DYIH2|1.0|Body by Fisher + Brains by Mattel = Stephenie Meyer     The concept of her being an adult with a degree in English is really amazing!    You really have to check your brain at the door to get through these books. Once I accepted that these books held no quality or literary value and that their purpose was just to take you on brainless, conscienceless, unfathomable, and illogical journey, I actually enjoyed what I read...that is until my brain started working again. Oh, the hours of my life and hard earned cash I won't ever be able to get back because of this hair-brained scheme called a book. I kept trying to hold out hope for SM, for her redeeming herself and she continued on the downward slope she began at book 2. Shame on SM and her publishers for selling this mess!
0596007124|5.0|The examples in this book are written in Java, and although I am a C# developer, I thought the book was excellent! It is fun, interesting, and packs a lot of information and creativity into every page.<br /><br />I was able to easily translate the examples into C# in all but the \\"Proxy pattern\\" and \\"MVC\\" chapters. For these, the code examples use components that are strictly found in Java (however, for the Proxy patterns you could attempt to follow along using some form of web service). On these chapters I was still able to learn at a high level where these design patterns are meant to be used, so I wasn't frustrated while reading. That said, I would easily recommend this book to a C# developer. (If you visit the Head First website there is a link to download all the examples - except MVC - in C#)<br /><br />This was my first Head First book, but it won't be my last. I have never read a tech book that was able to teach its allotted concepts in such an interesting way. I look forward to reading more from this series.
B0000640VM|4.0|My grand daughter loved it, I saw this movie long time ago but I couldn't remember it well, I enjoyed it to.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|A few months ago I started playing the song \\"Gotta Be Somebody\\" and a friend of mine came up and asked me what it was because it sounded great!  While that song blew me away, the rest of the CD doesn't quite do that.  If you're a Nickelback fan, definitely check out this album.  For the rest of you, this is one of those albums that you'll either love it or you'll hate it.  There is no in between.<br />This album is definitely on the dirty side (come on just look at the track listing!)  It's also a great hard rock album.  Sure there are a few mainstream songs like we're used to from All the Right Reasons.  If you want songs like from the last album, you can get Gotta Be Somebody, I'd Come for You, Never Gonna Be Alone, and If Today Was Your Last Day.  Other than that I would suggest checking out the band Theory of a Deadman.  They sound a lot like Nickelback and are more mainstream nowadays.  My personal favorite track \\"This Afternoon\\" is close but not quite like those others I listed above.<br />I would highly recommend listening to the album in its entirety online before you actually buy it.  I realize their last album sold an unbelievable amount of copies (with almost every song on it hitting the radio at some point).  Even if you loved their last album, if you're not a devoted Nickelback fan, listen online first.  Otherwise feel free to buy it!
B000A0GXGA|3.0|I bought this movie for a gift, but I watched it before to be sure that it was what my dad wanted, It brought so many memories.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|This movie was horrible. A fan of the first three, I have decided this forth Indiana Jones film does not qualify as an addition to the classic trilogy.    Why all major characters had to be introduced by being kidnapped, why there was a lack of any intriguing local characters and villains in the film, and why the ending was an incomprehensible disaster are beyond my understanding, but none-the-less a let down to my expectations. Add in three time-consuming car chases, some irrelevant and stereotypical character named \\"Mac\\", a shallow son named \\"Mutt\\", force Cate Blanchett to play the only talking (and completely unsophisticated) bad guy, and you have a pretty bad movie.    I believe George Lucas once commented that after finishing what the public expected from him with his second Star Wars series, he felt entitled to make as many bad movies as he pleases. Here we go.
4789009637|4.0|EDIT: Apparently Amazon won't let me paste URLs, so you'll have to Google the site names separately. I'll mark them with (www). Sorry about that!    The Genki course is a great textbook, and obviously a lot of time and effort went into putting it together. Since this book tries to do a little of everything, it understandably can't be content-rich in any one category; therefore, I highly recommend looking for supplementary materials to better flesh out your Japanese proficiency. Happily, a lot of online resources are available for free, and I'll try to list them below. My review is from the perspective of a native English speaker who is currently living and working in Japan.    Grammar: In each lesson, you get several new sentence patterns or grammatical points to try out, as well as notes on why and how to use them as well as pictures, diagrams, examples, etc. to get the point across. I found this section to be very clear and easy to understand.  How to make it better: One of my favorite sites is (www) Tae Kim's guide to Japanese grammar, which I did alongside the Genki lessons. You can also check out Jay Rubin's [[ASIN:4770028024 Making Sense of Japanese]].    Dialogues: The dialogues are kind of stilted and unnatural-sounding (try reading the English translations out loud and you'll see what I mean) and is IMHO the book's weakest point. This is made even more pronounced since the characters all address each other in polite form (desu, -san, etc) even though they're supposed to be close friends or even couples. But the bottom line is that they demonstrate the grammatical teaching point within a \\"realistic\\" context, so I guess I can't complain too much.  How to make it better: There's really no substitute for listening to native Japanese speakers. Watch a lot of Japanese shows without subtitles and try to just listen to their pronunciation and intonation, and when applicable, when they use the grammar points you learned. If you like manga, you can also look for children's series and make a project out of translating them (I chose Gakuen Senki Muryou). Especially try to observe the differences in speech between peers, friends, superiors, and customers. This is a pretty big deal in Japan, and using the wrong form to the wrong person can be pretty embarrassing. Believe me, I found out the hard way...    Vocabulary and Kanji: Each lesson comes with about 50-60 vocabulary words and 10 kanji (except for the first two lessons, which cover hiragana and katakana instead). The vocab is broken up into several categories (places, food, things to buy, verbs, etc.) which are then plugged into the sentence patterns provided in the grammar sections. The kanji section in the back provides you with a standard dictionary entry (with stroke order, on'yomi and kun'yomi, English definition, and a few example words).  How to make it better: There are a lot of fun ways of doing this one. (www) Yookoso has a great daily mailing list that will send you a new kanji character a day. (You can even set the JLPT level, if that's what you're studying for.) You can also check out the various quizzes and activities on (www) Charles Kelly's Japanese study materials site. If you don't mind spending a little extra money, I highly recommend [[ASIN:4893580914 Basic Kanji Book, Vol. 1]], which is what I've been using. I also highly recommend (www) Jim Breen's online Japanese Dictionary to look up any words instead of a paper dictionary. Unfortunately, there's no shortcut to learning vocab and kanji. You just have to keep practicing over and over and over until you've memorized them, and then after that keep practicing to stay in shape. I HIGHLY recommend making your own drill cards instead of buying pre-made ones because the process of writing the characters onto the cards will also help you to memorize them. (Not to mention it's cheaper!)    Exercises: This is my absolute favorite part of Genki. The exercises are usually very fun and cute, very repetitive (which, when learning a language, is a good thing) without feeling like a chore. The only thing I regret is that these exercises aren't as much fun to do if you're studying by yourself (like how I did) than if you were in a classroom. If you have a friend who can practice with you, it'd be even more fun. If that friend is also a native speaker who can correct your mistakes, then even better. At the back of the book are even more exercises, mostly to practice reading and writing.  How to make it better: You can go to Charles Kelly's site for more quizzes, or buy Genki's accompanying workbook and CD to practice with them. Also check out (www) Renshuu for a lot of practice exams (even includes Genki lesson material!) If you're studying for the JLPT, I recommend checking out Unicom's series of JLPT guide books (I bought [[ASIN:B001HQMUJ0 The Japanese Language Proficiency Test Level 4]]) which has a lot of practice questions.    I feel that the best thing this book provides is a solid foundation for good Japanese studying habits. Japanese can be an extremely overwhelming language to master if you don't have a good guide to show you what to learn, how to learn it, and how you can absorb information from other sources. Even though Genki is far from a comprehensive guide to Japanese, I feel that it's a great way to kick things off for beginners, and teaches you HOW to study the language.    If you're interested in buying the accompanying Genki materials: the workbook is great because it has a lot of exercises to do on your own (ideal for those trying to self-study). If you get the workbook, be sure to get the CD so you can do the listening comp sections, but if you're only using the textbook then DO NOT BUY THE CD. It's NOT worth the money just to hear the dialogue and vocab pronunciations.
1577314808|2.0|For the sake of my review, I see this book in two parts. The first is interesting, strange, helpful and also silly. Tolle does a good job of grabbing your attention with a very workable alternative to dealing with problems. As he explains it, there are no problems. All you have to do is agree with him and make them vanish from your interest.    Part two, about halfway in is when he starts stirring up his trouble. Now that he's got your attention, its time for his re-interpretations of Jesus. And they are interesting. They have merit, but most importantly, they deface the value of Tolle's message. Perhaps it was his own undying need to hold onto something of religious value... but shame on him for first discrediting religion and then rebuilding it. Can't we just get out of religion once and for all?    I put the book down before reaching the last page. I found it repetitious, unbalanced and disappointing.    As I had progressed through the first half book I found the solutions to \\"quieting your mind\\" helpful, but equally troubling as the author's philosophy tries to draw you in closer to its end-game of total peace. The problem is that he asks you to let go of not just too much, but everything you might hold dear. All cares and concerns, all of your history and ambitious speculations, you must give them all up for the promise that you don't need them. In other words, \\"details\\" are a falsehood, they have no real value. For many, maybe this is helpful. Perhaps for the person that just wants to find a way to survive through life without any sorts of conflict and obstacles this is a good solution. They can finally learn to stand aside and let the world whirl by past them. But for the other half, the go-getters and those eagerly wanting in life, Eckhart Tolle's path to perfection is flawed in the sense that his ultimate message is to \\"give up\\" in order to succeed. He seems to fail in understanding that it is \\"The Journey\\" that turns us on.    His quick jabs at the falsehoods and misguidance of all modern religion should be hailed with respect, but he destroys his validation as he begins to quote Jesus again and again.    His identification of the Ego vs. the Being, the two opposing entities of our minds that offer \\"idea modeling\\", \\"recall of events\\", \\"conflict\\" and \\"the use of time\\" for their existence are presented in a well expressed and simplified manner that should speak to just about anyone, and I found this very helpful. Also, his technique for \\"quieting the Ego, or mind\\" in its attempts to overwhelm and misdirect the \\"Being\\" away from the \\"Now\\" by always only looking back and ahead are simple, clever and productive. But to suggest that the Ego can be eradicated, and that such an accomplishment is in every individual's best interest seemed misguided to me.     Tolle has an answer for every question, skeptic and dismissal of his perspectives in this book, but that does not make him correct. He falls short by suggesting \\"total bliss\\" is the ultimate freedom. He forgets that it is also the struggle that defines us, the challenge that inspires us, and the pain that reminds us that we are human after all. I have doubt there is anything he can do to take that away from us, it is the very essence of what separates us from the animals. Time is not simple, it is real and it is complicated.    I now believe that the Ego must be kept in check (as it has a tendency to run amuck and stir all sorts of mischief), but that it is not a complete error. It is an evolutionary function that provides a balance for the brilliant potential we all have within ourselves as we look back, ahead, and into the multi-layered Now.

0812976525|5.0|Sometimes Buckley is perfect in his writing and \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" is one of his works that is a home run in terms of satire.  In the world of anti-smoking the protanginist works to make tabacco welcome in his job as PR for the tabacco industry.    And of course there are anti-soking elements/factions who do not take too kkindly to what he is trying to do as his job, which of course leads to witty and insightful dialogs and confrontations.    Some of the best parts are where the people saddled with the rather unenviable task of promoting smoking, guns and drinking gather together to discuss their repsective jobs and careers - in this day and age of how those elemments are perceived it is the only real sanctuary that they have.    Highly recommened for the satire and social commentary, some of the other elements as a pseudo thriller angle do not hold up as well and should not be taken to detract from the rest - that was not really the point of the book to me anyway.

032147404X|4.0|I bought this book for my fiance for Christmas. She loved it. She has already learned a few new tricks with her camera.

1594201927|1.0|In these hard times, we really could use an up-to-date, thoughtful reappraisal of the history of finance and the role it has played in advancing and periodically severely retarding economic and political development around the world.     Unfortunately this is not it.     Prof. Ferguson, who divides his time between Harvard and Oxford, has become the \\"James Michener\\" of world history. He writes effusively on everything from \\"Britain's contributions to civilization\\" and \\"warfare in the 20th century\\" to \\"the Rothschilds.\\" Having dipped into several of his long-winded tomes, I can honestly say that the game has seldom been worth the candle.     And now this. Here a documentary project for Channel 13 evidently drove this \\"Ascent\\" book project, with predictable consequences -- jump cuts from subject to subject that leave readers almost sea-sick; topic choices that seem to have been made for video potential and notoriety, not objective importance;  \\"mile wide, inch deep\\" scholarship that yields a very large pile of half-truths and incomplete thoughts.     I did like his chapter on housing finance, though it raised many more questions than it answered, and seemed to suggest that ignorant residential borrowers had more to do with the current debacle than, say, trillions in derivatives issued by Wall Street banks and insured by outfits like AIG.      Clearly the faults are not for want of ability. Where Prof. Ferguson actually gets up out of the armchair and does some first-hand research, as in his treatment of the Rothschilds, we get a few moments of serious, original scholarship.    Beyond that, and a few colorful tales,  the book amounts to coffee table nostrums for readers who want to be reassured that the \\"wall is not coming down\\" on our Capitalist Empire.     Among Prof. Ferguson's comforting conclusions: (1) finance capitalism really is the best of all possible worlds, at least in the long run; (2) hedge funds and global banks really are wonderful new instruments for \\"guarding against risk\\"; (3) \\"financial innovation\\" really is \\"indispensable\\"  -- despite all the innovation in REGULATION that this wizardry seems to constantly requires; and (4) \\"poverty\\" is NEVER \\"caused by\\" financial innovation -- a  conclusion that Ferguson repeats over and over, never with any evidence. (This one may come as a surprise to the 2 billion citizens of low-income countries outside China and India whose incomes utterly failed to grow from the late 1970s to 2000 because of \\"Third World sub-prime loans.\\"     The book also contains any number of factual errors. The dollar has strengthened, not declined, during current financial crisis.  China and other Asian countries have hardly \\"decoupled;\\" quite the reverse. Chile's 17-year flirtation with fascism under the corrupt, bloodthirsty Pinochet regime was a horribly costly mistake, not some interesting little experiment with privatized pension funds.  China's economic backwardness in the 19th was not due to a shortage of financial institutions (which are not an \\"uncaused cause\\" of anything)  but to -- as Ferguson, contra ipsum,   seems to acknowledge -- the impact of Western imperialism on China's weak state; Ken Griffin's Citadel hedge fund is hardly a work of genius, but a monumental failure; etc. etc. etc.     In short, this is a dumbed down, pollyanish, made-for-TV \\"hasty pudding\\" of a book.  Its success -  like the mortgage debacle itself - is based largely on hype and the \\"impeccable reputation\\" of its principle \\"securitizer.\\"      We need to remember two golden rules of book selection -- (1) always be suspicious whenever a film project leads to a book, rather than the reverse; and (2) always be suspicious of any book whose title is printed in a smaller font than that of the author's own name.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|A man has achieved great success academically, and then, while enjoying the fruits of such as a dean in a prestigious college, he makes a casual remark - something seemingly innocent - which is then perceived by two students as a racial slur.<br /><br />Thus begins the unraveling of the man's career.  In the stress of the aftermath, Professor Coleman Silk's wife Iris is felled by a heart attack and dies.  And then, Silk (portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Hopkins) begins an unusual friendship with a reclusive writer, Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise), who lives in a cabin by a lake on the outskirts of town.  As Silk reminisces - the goal is that Zuckerman will write a book about Silk's life - many secrets, held inside for more than fifty years, are revealed to the viewer.  But not to Zuckerman, apparently, because he is startled by the secrets at the very end of the film.<br /><br />Some of what Silk confesses is portrayed for us through flashbacks; the secrets are portrayed via flashbacks as \\"memories\\".  Then, almost as an aside, Silk describes an \\"affair\\" with a younger woman (Nicole Kidman): she is someone down-and-out, a former rich girl who ran away when she was being molested by a stepfather; and then, she becomes the abused wife of a Vietnam vet (Ed Harris), who stalks her and threatens her repeatedly.  In the midst of this, Silk is the perceived redemptive hero (to himself, at least), but when townspeople learn of the affair, he is scorned again.<br /><br />In the end, a surprising dramatic turn reveals, finally, to the characters in the story, the \\"secret\\" Silk kept close to him for all those years.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0001XAPX8 The Human Stain]] is a compelling movie that is based on the Philip Roth novel of the same name.<br /><br />Laurel-Rain Snow<br />Author of:<br />[[ASIN:1419656864 Web of Tyranny]], etc.
0670020745|5.0|There is a lot to learn about how the brain works and what happens before, during and after a stroke. This is one person's experience from a very unique perspective--a person who studies brain function and who has had a stroke. The vivid depictions of the experience and the recovery held my attention like a murder mystery--yet better because I felt it was a real story and I think knowledge of the brain function is more mystery than science.   I recommend that everyone, who might have a stroke, everyone who cares for someone, has a family member, or a friend who has had a stroke, should read this book. It is quick and there is at least one important bit of information for each of us.  The only connection that I felt was missing was information about recovery support from a \\"significant other\\". To me this would seem important.
1895565669|1.0|If you've gotten this far into the review stream, you've gotten a good sense for the factors that make this book so polarizing. One one hand are     I say it's not just creepy, though.    I say this book is solely responsible for an entire generation of helicopter parenting.  The book promotes a slightly over the top bond between a mother and child.  This is a bit anicdotal, but a 14 year old I know is read this every night, can't cross the street without holding someone's hand, and can't even use a knife without getting mom's help.    Besides the overall tone of the book,  the scene where the mom climbs in the window and puts the son on her lap seems inappropriate.  The son is grown, although he didn't even go to college.  Great job parenting.  Or they didn't show the college scene, because when she crawled into the dorm, she was arrested.      Anyway, she crawls into the son's bed, and puts him on her lap, and the next page, suddenly, there's a baby.  We have no idea where the baby came from.  We've never met the wife, and the son is not wearing a wedding ring.  But I think we all know that she is the baby's grandmother and mother!  Just like Chinatown with Jack Nicholson.      Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but mothers do not drive across town with ladders on their roofs and climb into their child's home.      Looking at this from a slightly different angle, would it be appropriate if a dad climbed into his adult daughter's house and put her on his lap.  I think not.    A much better book about the difficulty of watching your child grow up is \\"The Mole and the Baby Bird.\\"
B0000VCZKM|2.0|Having spent a month & a half performing in the orchestra for the stage version of Annie, I thought I'd enjoy seeing how the movie version compared to what we did. I was disappointed, to say the least. Especially since John Huston (one of my favorite directors) was at the helm.<br /><br />To me, Annie is family fare, and this movie had some elements not appropriate. There was one expression of profanity, the remainder were some suggestive dance sequences I was embarrassed to have my daughters see. And considering my daughter was an orphan in the play we did, she was taken aback at some parts of the movie, too.<br /><br />And the time the movie was made showed its dated-ness. I thought the musical sequence where the driver (an Asian) and Punjab (an Indian or Pakistani played by Caribbean Geoffrey Holder) dance was stereotypical in its portrayal.<br /><br />We found the Disney version, which I hope is closer to what we did.
045122499X|2.0|I love Ken Follett and particularly \\"the Pillars of the Earth\\" it was magnific, epic one of the best books I have read in this genre. I really could not wait for the announced sequel and read it as soon as it was available. The disappointment was enormous. It is way too long for his meager story, it turns around the same theme again and again. Some passages are so sugery I thought it could come out of some Danielle Steel book. The details about building techniques are interesting but again for the few. This book is somewhat of a mis-match it wants to combine learned information with a very uncomplicated love-story and it dis not work out.<br />Better luck nest time.<br />Christina

0142001104|5.0|There are so many reviews of this book already that I hate to add one more to the pile, but I must at least say this:  this was a FABULOUS read.  This book should be required reading in high schools, colleges, and beyond.  The basic premise being this:  you should open yourself up to all possibilities, i.e. rather than viewing a mistake as a problem, view it as an opportunity to learn.    While portions of the book were a little too academic (e.g. the descriptions of the central self and the calculating self), most of it was related in real-life stories and scenarios.  It was a quick read and truly enjoyable.  I picked it up after several co-workers recommended it and viewed a Benjamin Zander video on Ted.com.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|This may be one of the worst films I've ever seen -- even just for fun, it's just plain embarrassing! If you like/love ABBA's music (which I do), get their CDs.  If you like/love all these truly wonderful actors (I do!), watch them in something else!!! I just hope they were paid well and had a ball on location.  There is no plot, no script, and no, Pierce Brosnan, fine man and fine actor that he is, can't carry a tune in a ten-barrel bucket. I just kept waiting for this to be OVER! Glad I checked it out of the library instead of paying anything to see it. The best thing about it is the end titles.  Don't waste your time -- if you're looking for fluff, for fun, there are many other movies worth the time!

It seems the author put a bunch of articles together and sent them to the editor. No deep analysis by the author and several important facts of Steve Jobs' professional life were removed, such as how he stole the GUI from Xerox PARC and the ill-fated Lisa (the Lisa development played a major role within the Mac's history). Other than that it is a good book. As Steve Jobs himself said once: \\"Good artists copy. Great artists steal (Picasso)\\".

1604590483|2.0|The content of the book is very interesting and inspiring. However, the typesize used throughout is 10 point Times Roman, single-spaced. If you print a few paragraphs in this typesize on your printer you will have a good idea of how easy - or not - it will be to read. This is the second book I have come across in 1 day where the publisher is trying to cram as much information into as few pages as possible. I hope this is not a new trend in book publishing.

0345495004|3.0|As a designer living in Los Angeles, FLW looms fairly large in my world as a general influence on the architecture and aesthetic of the 20th century. I don't know much about him, but I know I can't throw a rock without hitting a FLW building, FLW furniture at the flea market, or some kind of design element influenced by him. Therefore, even on a base level, it was interesting to read this book just to glean some insight on the history of his career, if only for the period of time he was with Mamah Cheney. However, I found myself enjoying the novel purely for the fictionalized aspects of the relationship as well as the elements of truth.<br /><br />The thing that always gets me about biographies is that somehow, they are all the same. Perhaps it's the lives that are chosen to be depicted, or just the structure inherent in describing the course of a life, but they always follow the same pattern, a sort of rise-fall-rise so we're left with the idea that we should be elevated by how this person pulled themselves out of the pit to end in triumph. Interestingly, this is not the case with this book, which might also be its problem. I had no idea who Mamah Cheney was, much less about her life works and what happened at the end of her life, so things were somewhat of a shock to me because they lacked the typical rigid structure I've always found in biographies. Mamah's actions happened with little preparation and played out with even less understanding. This might be the way it actually happened, or, by the author's own admittance, it might not; but regardless, it was a curiously jarring series of events culminating in a truly bizarre conclusion.
0374530718|5.0|This book was recommended reading by my 12th grade Humanities teacher, who asked the entire class to read it the summer before school started. I duly purchased it, but couldn't get past the long section on Plato, and put it aside for possible future reading. I picked it up again about two years later, and for some reason, forced myself through the long, sometimes tedious lectures that Alberto gives Sophie and found an extremely compelling story underneath. I have since read it two more times, and each time I find myself more and more fascinated by the philosophical material and find myself now enjoying the stories of the great philosophers and thinkers in history. Although some may feel that this book is dry and dense, it really speaks to me, and should appeal to anyone who is interested in history, philosophy, or has ever asked themselves the questions, \\"Who am I?\\" and \\"Why is the world the way it is?\\"

0060557818|5.0|This book starts out at a perfect pace, introducing the reader to the main character's ordinary life, and swiftly sweeps both the reader and this ordinary man into a dark reality from which there is no escape. By the end of the book, I had a real affection for the bewildered Richard, and for his friends in London below: the curiously powerful Door, the conniving marquis de Carabas, and even the single-minded bodyguard, Hunter. It's easy to become concerned in their fates, and they are all unique and likeable characters, each in their own ways.<br /><br />This story is easy to relate to, as it follows a familiar plot: average person gets swept up in mysterious goings-on, meets allies, they have a quest to follow, with powerful enemies popping up now and then to interfere...or worse. This doesn't mean that the story is stale. Indeed, it constantly surprised me with its twists and turns, and its utter originality. But what makes the story familiar makes it comfortable; otherwise, the alien world in which Richard finds himself would be too cold and unknowable. Richard, being from London Above, gives the story its dose of reality, which of course makes the book all that more unnerving.<br /><br />All fans of fantasy and modern thrillers will enjoy this book. This is the first book of Gaiman's that I've tried, and I'm looking forward to reading more!
B001EO2UKO|3.0|At the risk of sounding shallow, I do not find SAFE TRIP HOME nearly as compelling and inventive as her second album, LIFE FOR RENT.  As other reviewers have remarked, this album is a bit of a downer.  To release a \\"downer\\" record, it needs to be truly great. The elements are here; but they fail to come together.  LIFE FOR RENT is a song cycle of lost love that, for all its bitterness and sorrow, ended with the beautiful and hopeful \\"See The Sun\\".  SAFE TRIP HOME is more about resignation with an absence of expectation.  The album cover of an astronaut adrift in space alone outside the world just about says it all.  Still, this is a good album.  But for a Dido album, good is not good enough.  Given the dismal state of much of contemporary music, we needed more.

B000005JA8|2.0|Captain Beefheart-Trout Mask Replica **<br /><br />To list Trout Mask Replica as a disappointment is more than an understatement. While largely influential and highly experimental that doesn't mean it is good.<br /><br />Captain Beefheart went on to influence Tom Waits, one of my all time favorites and one of musics all time best. However, TroutMaskReplica is one of the worst albums he and his Magic Band have ever recorded. Safe As Milk and Ice Cream For Crow are miles and miles better and ahead of this recording.<br /><br />The one thing this does have going for it is the unique approach. In a time where nearly every record was groundbreaking and world changing TroutMaskReplica just might surpass them all. It might stand as the most outlandish and bold moves of any album released during the late 1960's. The combination of free-form jazz, garage rock, blues, R&B, and Soul do make for a create an diverse pallet. However the groups other albums did it better, this feels like a pot luck where everyone tried to make everything but no one nailed the recipe.
1400079179|5.0|I finally got to pick up The Da Vinci Code, after seeing the movie a couple of years ago. I think by seeing the movie first, and then reading the novel afterwards makes the book much richer.  I was impressed that the movie followed the novel pretty closely, with only minor changes.  What makes this book so impressive is that it really makes you think about the concepts in the novel. It is clearly marketed as fiction, yet the Catholic Church seemed to treat this novel as heresy.<br /><br />As a novel it makes you really think about the possibilities in a plausible manner. Even the History Channel still replays the Da Vinci Code revealed special, which walks through the points made in a book. Isn't this the purpose of a really good book, to make the reader think about the story long after reading it?<br /><br />Now I'm eagerly awaiting the next movie from Dan Brown, Angels and Demons - and then I'll read the novel after seeing the movie!
1593081251|5.0|For a long time, this was one of my least favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. But having re-read it recently (it was the first selection for our Jane Austen Book Group on The Book Club Forum), I found myself falling in love with the story for the first time. Elinor is a heroine that one can easily love and respect, especially in the way she controls, and yet deeply feels her emotions. Marianne, however, did grate on my nerves some, but I respect her allowing herself to give herself completely to Willoughby. Elinor and Marianne really do seem like opposite sides of the same coin: one hold everything in, one lets everything out.<br /><br />This book also has some of the best comic characters, especially Mrs. Jennings, the jolly matchmaker. One has to admit how uninteresting her life has to be if her ambition is to marry off every eligible young woman she meets! I also think that Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother and sister-in-law are hilarious in their coldness and selfishness. You can tell that John likes to think of himself as charitable toward his sisters, but in reality he is completely self-centered. His wife, Fanny, is a wonderful villain for the book; she makes her husband seem positively warm.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I'm fortunate to have both the PS3 and XBOX 360, and my biggest complaint has always been the fact Sony hasn't upgraded the Dual Shock controller. I know the Dual Shock has received numerous rewards for its design but the truth is I wish it had does wonderful triggers the 360 controller has. Now I can proudly say it does, and the controller feels so much better. I'm not sure if its the way the buttons click as you pull the triggers or the fact that they fit snug in your hands but I love them. Don't be fooled, these triggers snap right on to your buttons ( I assumed adhesive was used). They come in a very small box, nothing fancy. But what they deliver is a wonderful upgrade to the PS3 controller for only $5.00. BUY THEM NOW!

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|After seeing the movie when it first came out, I was dying to get the DVD to find out why they made changes to the stage version. The commentary from director Phyllida Lloyd is extremely insightful and explains why they had to remove \\"The Name of the Game\\" and shortened some of the songs (though I wish they would have kept it in and shortened the \\"When All Is Said And Done\\" wedding reception number!). Surprisingly, none of the male actors were hired with knowledge that they could sing - so they were all nervous of the challenge of singing and dancing at the same time. I wish they had done a second commentary with the cast, but then they probably wouldn't have been able to release this before Christmas.<br /><br />There aren't too many deleted scenes (mainly of the 3 guys at the beginning reading letters), or many outtakes (the Making of video has more outtakes), but overall the 2nd DVD is well worth having in your library. Buy the 2 disc version and you won't be disappointed!!!
0763631205|4.0|I read this book in honor of Christmas, and it really put me in the Christmas mood! It's light, fun, sad, and presents an important message about Christmas. During this time of rampant commercialism and long lists to Santa, it's easy to forget that the greatest joys of Christmas come from the giving. This book illustrates the euphoria that Scrooge feels when he finally is able to give gifts, either of time, money, food, or whatever, to other people. Christmas is not about what you can get...it's about what you can give. If you want a story that will remind you of the real meaning of Christmas, this is it! In terms of story-telling, this book has classic Dickensian characters and ample humor and drama, making it a classic in its own right. If I had any criticism, it would be that the story seems to wander a bit and move even a little too fast. But it really doesn't take too much away from the experience.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I was one of those people that anxiously waited for each act as they were released.  Originally I was only in it for NPH, who is my favorite actor.  I ended up enjoying all 3 acts and have watched it several times since.  The songs are addictive and fun.      I preordered both the DVD and CD and was surprised at the speed at which they were received!  I have since lent out the DVD to convert friends into the madness that is Dr. Horrible (It's two r's H O R R) before I borrowed it out I watched it again and again.  Commentary! is almost as fun as the movie itself.  The songs are also stuck in my head.  I don't dare sing them out loud for I fear the looks I would get in my small little town when I start belting out \\"No one wants to be Moist.\\"  I would love to have the Commentary available on CD as well, but for now I'll just sing along at home!
159448385X|5.0|I recently picked up this book, while conducting a site visit in Kabul, Afghanistan.  I began reading this book inside my harden facility and finished on my military flight back to Europe.  In a few short weeks I return to Kabul, to conduct a tour of duty with NATO at the ISAF Headquarters.  This is not my first book nor will it be my last book on Afghanistan, but Khaled Hosseini ability to weave a story and history of Afghanistan so seamlessly, will keep you turning pages to the wee hours.  You will be captivated by the characters. Your will be grip by their pain and suffering.  And you will then understand why the free world is morally obligated to help the people of Afghanistan.<br /><br />Having traveled briefly on the streets of Kabul, I have seen first hand what the author describes, a city of beauty spoiled by years of war.<br /><br />This book should be required reading for all who question international intervention in Afghanistan...we (the world) can not let Afghanistan fall back into the hands of the Taliban.

0141439580|5.0|For some reason, I always think of Emma as my least favorite Austen, but I thoroughly enjoyed re-reading it. Emma is a very imperfect heroine, but Jane Austen was wrong in supposing that no one but herself would like her. I find Emma to be refreshing as a heroine, and she stands is stark contrast to Fanny Price in Mansfield Park (my least favorite Austen heroine). There is none of Fanny's timidness or inability to stand up for herself. Emma is independent and strong, and much more modern than other female characters in classic literature. Her mistakes in pride and arrogance are such as we all make on a daily basis. She presumes to understand people's emotions and thoughts and thinks she has a right to order things as she would have them be...very type \\"A\\", in my opinion. But, as her intentions in every case are good, as she only wants those she loves to be happy and prosperous, one cannot really blame her.<br /><br />The other characters in this book are also very satisfying, particularly Jane Fairfax and Mr. Knightley. Jane is the poor orphan on whom everyone in Highbury, the village in which Emma lives, dotes upon. Emma, of course, can't stand her at first, but only because of the knowledge that Jane is superior to her in many ways. How many of us have declared that we don't like someone simply because they're better at something than we are? Mr. Knightley, Emma's neighbor and long-time family friend, is her conscience, calling attention to those errors in judgment that Emma constantly seems to make. He often lectures her, but only in an attempt to set her on a better course. When faced with the prospect of losing him, Emma must confront her own feelings and question her own situation in life.<br /><br />It's altogether an enjoyable read, with plenty of twists and blunders, and should appeal to any fan of Jane Austen...or just anyone who wants to read the real version of the movie \\"Clueless\\".
B001EOQWF8|5.0|This is my first Blu-Ray movie and I have to say the picture quality was outstanding my 52 inch Toshiba LCD. A visual masterpiece if there ever was one.    However, the movie itself is lame. Not my cup of tea. My fiance loved it though. Definetly a kids movie but if you're new to Blu-Ray and want to see the best picture available do yourself a favor and buy this.     This movie is a technical showcase - the move itself has little substance if any to be had.

031606792X|2.0|I gobbled the first 3 books up in the last 3 days and couldn't wait to start this book.  It was promising in the beginning but when the honeymoon scene started to turn \\"weird\\" (to say the LEAST) I had to check the cover to make sure it was the same author.  I really am thinking about stopping now and pretending that he bit her on their honeymoon and lived happily ever after because this book has the potential of ruining the first 3 and I'm not 200 pages in.  I've read many, many book series and can't think of a time that I've been more disappointed.  I know that all of you who read Eclipse are dying to see how it all plays out but I would suggest reading up to the point of the beach honeymoon scene and then putting it down. I wish I had.
0307455874|5.0|To be fair, I should say up front that I am a very enthusiastic supporter of Barack Obama. This bias of course affected my reaction to this book, so please take that into account when reading this review. First of all, this book is superbly written. Obama has an immense talent for writing and for clearly putting forth his views. There is no more doubt about who the real Barack Obama is...all you have to do is read this book. It's easy to get a sense of his intelligence, his thoughtfulness, and his idealism, all of which have affected the way he approached politics. He comes across not as a perfect person, but as a real person, someone to whom all Americans can relate.<br /><br />In this book, Obama explores all aspects of American politics, like race, family, and relations between the two major parties. It's obvious that he's a Democrat, but it's also apparent that he respects Republicans. His approach to politics isn't one of exclusion and strict party loyalty. He knows that all Americans, no matter their beliefs or political leanings, have worth and he fights for all of them. He doesn't just represent Demorats...he represents Americans.<br /><br />All this may sound like an endorsement of Obama's presidential candidacy (you can take it that way if you want), but this book truly opens one's eyes to who the real Obama is (a funny, friendly, intelligent, and thoughtful man), what he stands for (liberty, freedom, and opportunity for everyone), and how he thinks politics should be exercised in America (with an open dialogue and a real debate of the issues). If you want to get to know Obama, or if you simply want to be inspired and believe that America is still a great country, then you have to read this book!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Yes, I'm sure that Michael Moore, as a crafty entertainer as well as a documentarian, exaggerates for effect on occasion: I'm sure the socialized medicine systems of Great Britain, Canada and Cuba aren't the picture-perfect utopian ideals they may appear to be in \\"Sicko\\", and- yes- our own system isn't as horrible as it's made out to be, either.  But Mr. Moore has convinced me that there's a broad truth at work: other countries have moved beyond health care for profit and the United States should, too.  Any imperfections in a socialized medicine system are far less serious than the shortcomings of our own system, where providers routinely attempt to skimp on treatment because doing otherwise is bad for the bottom line.<br /><br />Interestingly, the movie mostly concentrates on people who DO have health insurance in this country, demonstrating that private, for-profit care often isn't much better than having no health insurance at all.  Then we see how much happier people seem to be in other countries where health care isn't an issue: if you get sick, you get the treatment you need.  Again, I'm sure there are foibles and inefficiencies in universal, public health care systems, too (anything run by humans won't be perfect, after all), but who can honestly argue that health care decisions should regularly be made with an eye toward the bottom line?<br /><br />\\"Sicko\\" delivers its credible message in a thoughtful, entertaining, and, unfortunately, often heartbreaking manner, and a plethora of special features on the DVD drive the film's points home further.  Don't miss this one.
0060558121|4.0|I have only a passing familiarity with Gaiman's works, so this was a leap of faith for me.  I have always had a fascination with mythology so the crux of the novel was bound to please me, and I was thrilled that many of the central characters and events related to Norse mythology.<br /><br />It is a \\"road trip\\" novel, the book description makes no secret of this, but that does mean it will seem to wander without much purpose at times.  Some of the \\"coming to America\\" side stories run a bit long in my opinion, but overall don't detract from the novel.<br /><br />A nice conclusion that neatly wraps up all the dangling subplots, which I did not expect to be done well, but it works convincingly.<br /><br />In short, highly recommended. Be prepared for a meandering journey instead of a heavy plot-driven novel, but still a rewarding read.
1401322336|5.0|After making several of his recipes from his latest show on Food Network, I decided to buy a book.

0192802631|5.0|This is my favorite Jane Austen, and I tend to read it when I have that need for some \\"Austen therapy\\". Anne is much older than any other Austen heroine (she is 28 by the end of the book), but that difference in age has made her more wise, thoughtful, intelligent, and sensitive. She has known the pain of disappointed love, and has lived through it. She didn't \\"die of a broken heart\\" or anything like that. She suffered, learned from it, and managed to come out the other side with her senses intact.<br /><br />Like all Austen heroines, there is nothing sentimental about her or her romance with Captain Wentworth. In fact, their interactions with each other, after an absence of eight years, illustrate how very realistic the story is. Wentworth is angry and resentful, and uses the young, spirited Louisa Musgrove to make Anne see that she has no power over him, even to make her jealous. Most of us have had similar experiences with ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends. The book is completely relevant to the lives of modern readers, which is the very thing that keeps Jane Austen fresh after all these years.<br /><br />Persuasion is also supremely entertaining, with delightful and hilariously vapid characters, such as the vain Sir Walter Elliot, the conniving William Elliot, the the petulant and constantly ill-used Mary Musgrove, and the scheming Mrs. Clay. Any fan of Austen will already have read this book, but any beginner Austen fan, or someone who has not yet ventured to try Austen yet, but is curious, should read this book.
1596792507|5.0|I am reading this version to my 8 and 6 year olds.  This is a story that I have read many times, and enjoy very thoroughly.  The type is large, and languages is not condescending, but easily grasped by my kids.  There are plenty of illustrations throughout the book, and a cast of characters - with simple introductions - is in included in the beginning of the book.<br /><br />This series of books is a great way to get kids interested in the 'great works'.  We have purchases a number of them, and so far the kids love them all.
0446402389|2.0|The concept is simple, take the Andrei Chikatilo serial murders and move them back in time to an era of dogma and fear in the Soviet Union.    I have no idea how accurate Smith's portrayal of the time and place was.  It was very claustrophobic and the book moves along very well.  The societal paranoia and suspicion gives rise to a strong thriller.    I bought in as the hero starts a star MGB agent who believes in the state and all that it entails.  The transformation from disciple to heretic is believable and exciting.  The plot moves along quickly and is well written.    Smith loses two full stars from me for the M. Night Shyamalan twist at the end.  The twist is preposterous and truly ruins a good piece of writing.  A thriller often has twists and surprises but when it inspires a response of \\"That's really stupid\\" then it has gone wrong.    This book was longlisted for Booker which is surprising for a novel of its genre.    I highly recommend 90% of this novel but as noted the ending really ruined the book and left a bad taste in my mouth.
0786867973|4.0|I received this for Christmas, it was ordered from Amazon, the corner was in shipping although not return worthy but disappointing as its a pet peeve.

0141439475|4.0|I was lucky enough to be assigned this book in my Modern Europe class. It's a quick read, moving along at a nice pace, but not jam-packed with too much action. Instead, this horror novel is one that reaches the reader on a deeper level. Victor takes an emotional journey, from the happiness and security of his childhood, to his fevered and single-minded pursuit of the creation of life, to the horror and despair at the realization of what his dream will cost him. He is the consummate Romantic hero: tragic, boldly and blindly following his own ambition, and agonizing over the loss of his own soul.<br /><br />There was really only one thing that bothered me about this book. One is the fact that every time something tragic happens to Victor, he falls into a debilitating fever. I know that this sort of illness was a favorite of the Romantics, but after a while, it seemed formulaic. Other than that, the book is nearly perfect: tragic hero, sympathetic yet terrifying villain, beautiful and innocent heroine, and a landscape that is just as important to the story as Victor and his monster are. I would recommend this book to any fan of contemporary horror fiction, and also to any fan of Romantic fiction or poetry. Also, if you're going to watch one of the many film adaptations of this book, I suggest watching Kenneth Branagh's 1994 version, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. Robert De Niro plays the monster, and you can't get any better than that. Besides, it's the one movie that stays almost completely true to Mary Shelley's original story.
B00023B1A8|5.0|Just got this DVD today, it was great.  We first listened to it in 5.1, not very good, then switched to the stereo 2 (need to make sure you use the setting that works best with your system!) and much much better.  I've seen them live and this brought back happy memories.  The boys still have their voices and know how to work a song.  Stephen still has a way with the guitar.  It is a pleasure to watch them work together, it shows how much they like each other and the music. I highly recommend this to those who love this group.  A wonderful addition to a collection of classic works.

031606792X|1.0|I was excited to get read the end of the Twilight saga because I was a big fan of the first 3 books (Eclipse was my favorite). However, the author really drove a stake into the series with Breaking Dawn. The plot was TERRIBLE. It completely lost the essence of the first three books. It's hard to imagine that a plot can become over the top when dealing with vampires and werewolves but somehow Stephanie Meyer found a way. For those of you who are Edward fans, I warn you not to read this book, Remember him the way that he was, he completely loses his appeal in this book. The only brightside is that for a portion of the book Jacob is narrator an at least he is witty and we get to escape Bella's annoying logic and insecurity for a little while.
B00150B2SS|4.0|I just finished reading Tinker Tailor and I'm left without a strong feeling about the book, prompting me to give it 3.5 stars.  Let me say first that I was looking for a good spy novel that also had a good literary wit to it, beyond say Tom Clancy (who, in general, I like).  After a recommendation from a British friend who has literary tastes, I read Tinker Tailor.      I noticed immediately that Le Carre certainly writes in a literary way.  His language is very good, vocabulary excellent, and grammar sophisticated; and he incorporates many other scenic and descriptive details to enhance the story.  These details are reminiscent of the writing of Ian Flemming, who would add some flair by dropping the names of fine liquors, fashionable places, and other proper things while telling the story of James Bond.  In a similar way, Le Carre uses many proper nouns (for example, places in England) in telling his story, describing them in colorful ways. Unfortunately, not being British, I feel like I missed many of the cultural references. Now, on the one hand, I like a rich description of the setting, but on the other hand, I get bored when the author starts to drone on about them.  And I felt that Le Carre was droning.    In fact, I feel like he was almost more interested in hearing himself than telling the story, and that is why I describe him as pedantic.  I can't quite put my finger on it.  But it seems that many of the details that he added weren't relevant to the storyline.  In contrast to Hemmingway, who would paint a picture of the the story's scene, Le Carre doesn't really do that.  He spends a lot of fanciful words on painting the scenes of certain flashbacks that the characters have, but those scenes are usually not central to the story (this is Le Carre's attempt at giving depth to the characters, but frankly not very well done).  Thus, those fanciful words are in some ways wasted, unless you like to read fanciful words for fun.  These side descriptions left the story feeling a little slow, and I often found myself skipping lines because I was getting bored with the progression of the story.    Which brings me to the story itself.  If you are looking for an adventure novel, filled with exciting happenings like bombings and chase scenes, look to someone like Tom Clancy, not Le Carre.  The attraction of this book is the slow elaboration of the spy's tale, probably mimicking the real-life spy game.  Le Carre very cleverly sews together a decent story about how George Smiley found a Soviet mole penetrating the British intelligence service, aka The Circus.  As with real intelligence work (at least, I assume, since I'm not a real-life spy), it was mostly about research, reading, and observing, and Le Carre takes us through the process as Smiley unravels the mystery of the mole.  Hence, there were no fast scenes, no amazing car chases, no action in general.  Nor was the character description that great - in contrast to what some other reviewers wrote, I found that Le Carre did not adequately describe his characters, leaving only a superficial connection to them.  For example, I found Smiley's incessant whining, yearning, and inaction regarding his cheating wife to be unrealistic, considering that Le Carre tries to make him out to be a super-star by the end.  Looking at it another way, I couldn't believe that a fat, dopey guy like Smiley could turn out to a top-five leader of The Circus, like Le Carre would try to make you believe. Although some would argue that Le Carre was ingeniously trying to make us recognize the divergent and sometimes paradoxical sides of human nature, something just didn't add up.      But the story very well outlined how dangerous a mole can be and how tricky it can be to spot one.  That, I suppose, was the point of the novel; if so, Le Carre achieved his point well.  After reading the book, I was left with a clear feeling that a mole is a parasite, and I \\"got\\" why a mole could be so devastating, both politically and emotionally, to a spy organization.  And frankly, despite some slow parts, I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know how it finished!  The suspense of reaching the climax, which was right at the end, trumped my boredom in a few places, which was good enough to keep me hooked until the conclusion.    I gave this book 3.5 stars.  At first, I thought about giving it 4 stars due to the literary quality of Le Carre's writing, the accomplished description of the dangers of spy work, and the suspense that led me to the end.  But because I found some of his detail more pedantic than functional, his character descriptions lacking in some cases, and the actual story to be linear, it lost my attention in some places.  And when parts of a story lose my attention, I feel like 4 stars can't be justified.    I'll read The Honourable Schoolboy, as I understand it is a bit deeper and more thoughtful, to see if I have a different opinion of Le Carre's work afterward.    All in all recommended in you like spy books, as it's a good story and a good read, but you may or may not be blown away by it.
0525478183|3.0|I heard about \\"Paper Towns\\" from a news release about the movie version of the book. I was excited to read it after getting to know John Green from his blog. It was the first book I downloaded to my brand new Kindle, and I read it in one day.    Here's what's awesome about the book: the adventure, the honesty, the bravery, and the mystery. Oh, and the dialog. Perfect dialog. Made me smile, laugh out loud, and wish I knew some of these kids (or was more like them in high school).    John Green is a masterful storyteller, that is evident. I loved that the characters in his book acted like modern teens, and also did really unique things (e.g., urban exploring). I also loved how he captured that dreamy, ghost-like, suddenly bonding, team-oriented atmosphere that is the last few months of high school. Spot on.    Here's what's not-so-awesome about the book: the over-explanation at the end of the book. Seriously. It killed it for me. Well, almost.     On the whole, it was a mighty decent read. But John, do you have to tie it all up at the end? A little reveal is good, but do these characters really have so much self-awareness right in the moment?     That we get to see what happens to Margo is terrific, and although I wanted her to be a bit more messed up and dark, I'm cool with it. But what I didn't need (or want) was the kind of emotional awareness that only comes from reflection.    Can't wait to see the movie. Glad to know you're writing it, John. So many great moments in this book, which will translate perfectly to film.     Now I'm off to read your other books.
B001F12J3Y|5.0|My wife and I have seen the IMAX 3D version twice which was the finest 3D experience ever.      I knew of the problems with the 3D Anaglyph process on the DVDs.  There are 2 ways to minimize the problems.  You need the sharpest, brightest, and clearest images to make it work.  I bought the blue ray version and bought two pairs of optical quality 3D Anaglyph glasses (we bought the ones with the blue and red lenses) from an internet 3D specialty shop (Amazon might also sell them).  The glasses run about seven dollars each and will also fit over most eye glasses.  They will work with some other 3D DVDs but not all (they will not work with Journey to the Center of the Earth, for example).  The websites will tell you which movies the glasses will work with.    My wife and I find that the 3D effect from these glasses is much much stronger than with the cardboard glasses that come with the DVD. The image also is not blurry due to the optical quality of the glasses, at least with blue ray DVD.  I also turned up the brightness on the TV which is recommended.    There are two faults with the Anaglyph process that cannot be avoided.  The colors tend to be washed out and you will see ghosting (double images) sometimes.  When we watch the DVD, we don't concentrate on the ghosting, and after a while, you are so wrapped up in the 3D, that you don't notice it as much.    For us, it was worth it to buy the optical quality 3D glasses as they were so cheap.  However, I do not think that these glasses will help if you get headaches and may not work well for everybody.      One thing that we noticed was how much better the characters' expressions look in 3D than in 2D.     So for us, the blue ray 3D DVD was worth the cost.  It is not as good as IMAX 3D, but it works for us.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|+++++MY REVIEW CONTAINS NO SPOILERS+++++++++++++  This is a character study of a man who makes his living as a pro wrestler.  A raw, brutal study of a raw brutal world.  In no way do you have to be a fan of or have knowledge of wrestling to gain from this film.  It is well acted, well scripted, well directed and well shot. Harks back a little to a 1970's style of film, perhaps reminding a little of \\"Blue Collar\\", where plot, character and direction take pride of place over special effects and star cameos. I would recommend it to anyone over 18 as an example of a very good film.

B0006399FS|5.0|I just bought this album.  I have all of the U2 albums.  Not sure what took me so long to aquire this one.  Glad....very glad I did.  A friend of mine bought Boy when it first came out as a result of seeing \\"I Will Follow\\" on MTV. Two months later I saw U2 open for the J. Geils Band in front of 2500 adoring individuals waiting to hear Peter Wolf blast out \\"Centerfold\\".  The rest is history....for me.  I knew this band was destined for greatness.  They did not dissappoint.  Album by album the band grew in depth and performance, never duplicating themselves.  They were fortunate that their fan base was nearly religious in their fervor and loyalty, allowing the band to increase commercially and expand artistically.  Not a small feat in our microwave culture.      I continued to buy each U2 album to see what was \\"on their minds\\".  Ever a fan of sharp lyrics, U2 never has disappointed me.  However, after Actung Baby, U2 strayed further and further from any melodic or production cohesiveness.  I don't intend to mislead.  I think all of the U2 albums are worth the effort.....and some of them do take some effort or \\"warming up to\\".  Nonetheless, I was ready for a return to War or Boy or even Rattle and Hum.  Let's Rock!!!    This is it.  U2 returns to the beginning, full circle, and is as fresh as they were in 1980.  I wanted to review this album from a sense of history. I am not going to give a song by song reference.  Beware those of you looking for the U2 from 1991 forward.  This is a culmination of a band not afraid or making any apologetics for sounding very much like U2.  I hope that they continue.  The Rolling Stones aren't worried, AC/DC is not worried, Rush is not worried that they are RCCK AND ROLL.  True U2 lifers will love this album.  I hope no one has been discouraged from buying this because of the inexcusable one star ratings.  Must say, I scratch my head and wonder who these one star wonders were listening to.    Oh well.  Thank you U2

B00005YU1O|3.0|\\"Waking Life\\" is probably not like any other film you've seen before: the majority of it consists of philosophical monologues that express different perspectives on the loosely connected ideas which the main character is trying to explore. On the whole, these monologues range from the fascinating to the obnoxiously trite, and even though this film expresses some wonderful concepts, it also manages to present the cliche ideas in a completely serious fashion.    Having said that though, \\"Waking Life\\" is still a unique cinematic experience worth watching. Even though the plot line has very little continuity, it's the ideas that really matter. In some ways, the main character is almost irrelevant; it's not so much about him discovering these concepts as it is about us discovering them. Unfortunately though, at times the philosophical monologues are thrown at us in such a haphazard manner that we have very little time to absorb, much less intellectualize them. Although many scenes are truly valuable, others are just jarring or distracting (for instance, in one scene a stranger walks past the main character and simply says, \\"Kierkegaard's last words were, 'Sweep me up'!\\").    On the other hand though, I feel like in a way we are meant to be confused, just as the main character is. The animation technique is certainly a good choice for this effect, and is very well-done. Another very positive aspect of this film is the soundtrack, which is superb. Overall, I think this is a pretty decent film, even if its moments of brilliance are broken up by waves of generic pop philosophy.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I've been an ABBA fan since the release of their first record. I have all the original record albums that I am little by little converting to disc. Never have I seen their music better represented.        I have never though been a fan of Meryl Streep....this movie changed my opinion of her as an actress.I wasn't aware until recently that she could sing & was very pleased to see her in this role.       This is a wonderful \\"Feel Good\\" movie to be watched again & again.  The music numbers seem to be written around the story instead of the other way. Some of the songs are campy, but that adds to the fun of the movie. Others, like Streep's rendition of \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" can be heart wrenching. My favorite part of the movie is the scene built around the song \\"Voulez Vous\\"...also the scene with the song \\"Slipping Through My Fingers.\\"        Buy this for yourself & watch it multiple times...you will smile, laugh & maybe even cry, but you will not be disapointed.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|RUSH!  Enough said. What do they owe the music community?  Well, absolutely nothing.  Rock music is a strange commodity in that it offers Britney Spears, The DeFranco Family, 50 Cent...oops...my mistake on 50 Cent.....no music there.  Nonetheless, I am sure that classical, romantic, swing music all had their frauds. Question is:  who remains in history and who has been tossed to the scrapheap of nothingness.    RUSH LIVES!! Yep, after 38 years of plugging along Rolling Stone even recognized them (Don't sob too hard....AC/DC was on the cover for the first time a few weeks ago....see what happens when you leave ROCK AND ROLL  in the hands of popular culture and a bunch of less than desirables..)    OK..... Let's move forward.  \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is a tour de force ranking with any of the great albums that RUSH has made over their illustrious career.  For any of the uninitiated this should give you some insight into the broad appeal.  I have two sons, one is 13 and the other is 9.  One plays bass and the other guitar.  Guess what bands they like? Well Cheap Trick, Guns and Roses...oh yeah....RUSH!  They love this album and so do I.  Why would I even inject this into this review? Here's why.    Rush- Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson, Neil Peart- are music icons....yes....music icons.  No genre needed.  \\"Snakes and Arrows is an inspired effort that just floored me.  Get it. Rock with it, and enjoy the lyrics, or be troubled by them.  Whatever the case may be, this is an album that deserves intense attantion.  Old fan or brand new, you will not be disappointed.....unless you prefer the DeFranco Family or Britney Spears.  No hope for 50 cent fans.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I had never really gotten into American Idol and that is how it was going for Season 7 as well. Then out of nowhere DAVID COOK sings Lionel Richie's \\"Hello\\" and I was awestruck. SIMPLY INCREDIBLE. I was HOOKED ON COOK from that moment on and each week watching him was a wonderful experience. I had never voted before but I voted for David weekly. The man just simply moves me. Even has made me cry several times. The night he was announced as the Season 7 American Idol winner I was jumping for joy in Sacramento.  The downside to liking a contestant on American Idol is that you get used to them singing someone else's hits and when they make the transition to their own songs it can be a letdown at first. Not in a long time had I anticipated the release of a CD as much I was David Cook's. Initially I was not blown away. Something was missing. But as with most CD's given a chance they grow on you. And grow on me it has. I now really, really enjoy it. I knew it was good because each time I listened to it my favorite song kept changing.I have read about this same sentiment on lots for reviews of this CD. Not sure why some reviewers say every song sounds the same as i find this to be totally untrue.  I had purchased the MP3 download of David's \\"Analog Heart\\" and that album is AMAZING. It quickly entered my personal TOP 5 favorite CD's of my lifetime. I strongly urge everyone to obtain a copy of that when and if it becomes available again. But now back to the David Cook CD. Standouts for me are, Declaration, Light On, Come Back To Me, Barbasol and Avalanche. Each of these have, during a listen, become my favorite track on the CD. \\"Declaration\\" is a great song to drive to, \\"Light On\\" is destined to become a classic and \\"Bar-b-Sol simply kicks [...].. and when I listen to \\"Avalanche\\" the greatness of David's voice just buries you. Though still not completely blown away, (maybe I expected too much?) I do enjoy this CD and am glad to own it. David has \\"the voice\\" that I would call \\"An American Dream\\". I look forward to his second CD with great anticipation. But till then I will enjoy this one (almost platinum in sales after 6 weeks). WAY TO GO, COOKIE!!!. He is now my favorite male artist of all time and second favorite artist, just a tad behind the incomparable Tanya Tucker.

142813994X|3.0|Stephen King has long been an underappreciated master of a dying craft. He may very have sold more books than Shakespeare but you wouldn't know it when you consider the lack of respect he gets from the industry. On Writing is his attempt to give something new to all the writers who have been inspired by his works. I know that I would probably not be an author today were it not for Stephen King. He was the first author I ever wrote to for advice on how to get started. I've since published seven books.<br /><br />This book is a great place for new writers to begin. Stephen focuses his attention of the writing itself and discusses ideas like writing space, time committed, discipline and the love of the craft. It wasn't the best book I've read on writing but because of his name recgonition I'm sure it will get more attention than the usual instructional title. He uses his lifetime of experience to provide a valuable basis for what is possible. His is a voice long waiting to be heard and deservedly so.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|First of all, I ordered mine through Amazon less than 3 weeks ago and I received it just fine.   Its got enough humor and drama to make it enthralling.  I've watched some docs on life in the ideal '50s-early '60s so this fullfilled by history fix as well.    I've heard mixed reviews on the series.  The conclusion seems to be that it is best to watch back to back instead of weekly.  Watching it in one weekend is not difficult.  I couldn't wait to jump to the next episode.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|what can I say . . . great movie, and absolutely fantastic service from Amazon.com.  I would not hesitate to order other items from you in the future.
B000ETQR3Q|1.0|The Longshot is broken already, it will not fire, it was not working by 12/28.  The removable pistol section wouldn't fire from the get-go.  My son is not particularly tough on toys, and didn't do anything extreme with this one--I'm very disappointed.
B001NFYTOO|3.0|Did anyone's set come with the same exact two discs inside the mask? My brother and I both received this from our mom on Christmas. I know the discs looks the same outside, but I put both in the dvd player and they have the same exact content on them. Anyone else find this? Wtf?
1416955070|5.0|I found this book purley out of quincidence, but it has turned out to be one of my favorites. This book is one of those that you start reading in the early afternoon with no particular rush, and finish it at 4 in the morning due to the fact that it was so good you couldn't put it down. Your then stuck, not being able to go to sleep due to the fact that your thoughts are centered only on this book and that you can't wait to get your hands on the second one. Personal expirence.      Clare has created an urban fantasy combining many different fairytales in a gripping, interesting, and seductive way that makes you wish it were real. The characters are varied from the egotistical yet undeniably attractive demon-slayer Jace to the lovable and stubborn herione CLary. All of this is set in the most unpredictable and fast paced city in the world, New York. This novel is witty, entertaining, fast-paced, gripping, and even a bit romantic. Its one of those books that make the impossible seem real. I highly recommend it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I ordered this series from an Amazon Vendor and was pleased to receive it promptly and is pristine condition.  I have since enjoyed the series and feel it to be painfully authentic, certainly much more than mere entertainment.
B00005JMEW|2.0|I thought Pulp Fiction was the best film of the 90s, which pains me to say, because the decade contains Goodfellas and Martin Scorcese is my favorite director. When you consider PF along with Reservoir Dogs and the True Romance screenplay, Tarantino emerges as one of the singular voices of the past 35 years. But it seems he has lost it. Yes, there are flashes of brilliance here (Uma's initial meeting with fighting master Pei Mei is mesmerizingly cool and surreal). However, it seems as if more than 50% of this film is spent in having to listen to David Carradine's Bill ramble on about the film's backstory. It's a film Quentin, not a novel.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|Great album, many great tracks but the one standout and one of the greatest song from the 80s has the be the Chauffer.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This was the best movie of 2008, in my opinion.  Great movie, great acting, and it is a lot of fun to watch.  Robert Downey is at his best, and so are the other actors.  You'll love it, it is a must for any dvd collection!
B00005B9UZ|2.0|I liked the storyline for this DVD, but did not like the editing. I saw the original movie when it was released, and this is not the original. Some of the characters have been changed, and the editing is poor. For the original DVD I would give 5 stars, but for this (the non-region 2 DVD) edited version I would give 1 star but I like the story so I give it 2 stars.
B000P0I4O4|1.0|I rented this movie because of the main actors in it.  Bottom line. this movie SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!  I wouldn't even tell someone to waste their money and rent it.  The script, dialogue, and acting all suck.  And it is extremely boring.  Do not waste your time!
B00197POXG|4.0|This is an excellent series, but be aware that these DVDs do NOT have closed captioning or subtitles. Also, the packaging is flimsy. The studio definitely skimped on this set.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I ordered this dvd and now see that it is on sale. It is worth the $8 I paid for it. There are 3 levels and modified versions of some of the exercises.  It's 3 cycles of: 3 minutes of weights, 2 minutes of cardio and then 1 min abs. Run time is about 30 minutes if you include stretch and warm-up. I tried my Power 90 dvd a few days later and I was so much stronger.  If you want an even more challenging workout try the workouts from her book 'Making the cut' which also includes a meal plan.
B000VZJMEE|5.0|I really love this album.  Paul's voice simply amazing on \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You\\" and \\"My Way\\".  Other songs witch highlight this album are the \\"Crazy Crazy Nights\\", \\"Reason To Live\\" and \\"Turn On The Night\\". Ya it may not be the heaviest album but they don't have to be all the same.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This is the BEST sitcom on television.  The story revolves around 4 super geeks, geniuses who are scientists obsessed with comic books, Star trek and video games among other things. Johnny Galecki(Leonard) is in love with the pretty girl across the hall. Galecki is good in everything he does.  Jim Parsons(Sheldon)is hilarious as Galecki's room mate.  I agree with one of the previous reviewers that Parsons deserves an Emmy for his work on this show.  He makes me laugh out every Monday night.  He plays \\"finicky\\", \\"quirky\\" and \\"nerdy\\" with a touch of mad genius to perfection. If your not watching, start.  You wont be sorry.  I definitely recommend this DVD if you love the show or just want to watch to catch up.  Five star laughs.
B000068PQ0|2.0|I just want to start by mentioning that I'm still incredibly impressed with the band for creating incredibly unique music after doing so for 20 years. It's always something strange with every new album and, for that matter, every live show. But honestly, I've never really been a huge Lips fan, and Yoshimi was no exception. The album begins with \\"Fight Test,\\" which is possibly my favorite song by the band, and soon after there's \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots, Pt. 1,\\" but that's really all I could stay awake for. The rest of the album is just strange sounds and Wayne Coyne's tired, melancholy voice singing about robots and magicians and other strange things. I respect them for being weird and doing their own thing, but this album just wasn't for me. It seems to be the band's most popular album, so I still recommend that you give it a listen. Just don't blame me if you hate it.
0316035904|5.0|This book was quickly shipped and error on my part handled courteously. A great seller. *****
B001DDBCUA|5.0|This is movie was surprisingly wonderful.  If you liked the televison show you will love this movie. It was not one of those badly scripted, hack job some movies seem to be that try to play off a succesful tv series.  This was a wonderful movie with twist and turns and the wedding scene was fantastic and showed the real depth of Carrie.  I also have to admit I loved the ending.  I don't want to give it away but lets just say that the closet scene with Carrie and Mr. Big is more romantic and real than Casablanca and I watched it over and over and it did not get old.  This is well worth buying, it should be a classic keeper.
0307388840|5.0|Beautifully written.  There's a scene in which the mother sits and thinks about her life that is a fascinating insight into her character.  I saw the movie first and still enjoyed the book immensely.
0385340990|4.0|I chose to read \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" book because I was intrigued by the title.  The book is an historical novel of how a group of individuals on the English Channel Island of Guernsey survived five years of Nazi occupation during World War II.<br /><br />A group of islanders roast a hidden pig and in their festivity lose track of time.  The \\"Society\\" is a book club that forms quickly to protect its members from arrest by the German soldiers for violating curfew.  The Germans allow artistic and cultural activities on the Guernsey Islands to prove to the British that it is a \\"model occupation.\\"  The \\"Society\\" grew to become the anchor that connected the islanders as a community in a time when they were cut off from the rest of the world.<br /><br />The authors Mary Ann Shaffer and her niece Annie Barrows both share a love of reading through their varied experiences as writers, editor, librarian, and working in bookstores.  This is Shaffer's first novel.  Annie Barrows is the author of the children's series Ivy and Bean, as well as, The Magic Half.<br /><br />The book reveals the ingenuity, perseverance and determination of the human spirit in a time of crisis.  The book was in the form of letters from \\"Society\\" members to a writer in London in 1946 that helped to reveal the differing personalities and their interconnectedness.  The lure of the Guernsey Island and its residents changed forever the life of the London writer.<br /><br />I was slightly hesitant at first to read a book in the format of letters.  However, the letters from the Guernsey Islanders were able to weave a story in a way that a narrative could not.  According to the Islanders the Germans kept a strict count of all cows and pigs.  A dead animal was reported over and over so that the islanders would have something substantial to eat. The Germans begin to tattoo all animals so that there could be no more dead animal switching.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to all individuals seeking to be uplifted by the creativeness and determination displayed by the Guernsey Islanders and to those who are curious about a potato peel pie recipe.  Other inspirational books written about events during this time period are The Zoo Keeper's Wife by Diane Ackerman, Schindler's List by Thomas Keneally and The Diary of Anne Frank by Anne Frank.by the creativeness and determination displayed by the Guernsey Islanders and to those who are curious about a potato peel pie recipe.

B00000634J|5.0|This is the first album I've bought by John Lennon, though I have bought albums by the Beatles beforehand (my favourite being \\"Magical mystery tour\\"). Purchasing a Lennon compilation was always going to be more likely than buying something by the other Beatle's solo works. That's because Lennon always seemed to have the superior solo songs, as well as having more of them. These songs are my favourites:    Woman- a beautiful love song with a warm sentiment and sweetly sung.    Beautiful boy- a dreamy, delicate and beautiful ode to his young boy Sean. Has an oriental sounding element to the song and some nice Caribbean sounding steel drums.     Happy Christmas (war is over): a song of peace and optimism. Features his wife Yoko and a children's choir. Has jingle bells and accoustic guitar.     Give peace a chance: another peacenik song for this politically and socially active singer. Has a classic singalong chant and an iconic drum pattern. Composed at the time of American involvement in the Vietnam War, which was socially divisive around the world. A great but simple song with a simple beat, claps and chant.    Nobody told me: one of his best ever songs, in my opinion-he was still making great music before he was tragically murdered by a man he had shown kindness too only moments earlier. Has Lennon's trademark sense of whimsy: \\"There's UFO's over New York and I ain't too suprised\\".        The above songs are Lennon's greatest, I think.        There are quite a few more songs that I like, though not as much...no doubt many people would like these songs more than the ones I like the best:    Mind games: distinctive keyboard sound (trippy) and a nice quality to his vocals.     #9 dream: a delicate, pretty, ethereal sounding song. Has a violin type sound and a twangy lead guitar. I like Lennon's dreamy vocals and Yoko's sensual words. Reminded me of some of fellow Beatle George Harrison's songs.     (Just like) starting over: a nice song concerning re-invigorating along term relationship. Nice studio effects added to the song.     Watching the wheels: here we hear Lennon at his reflective best-at peace with himself, life, the world and his place in the scheme of things.     Stand by me: a great cover of Ben E King's classic. Probably the definitive version of this song.        Although it's not a favourite song of mine, you will often see his song \\"Imagine\\" top popular/critical polls for the title of the greatest song of all time. It's a spiritual for atheists. Simple, yet thought provoking and idealistic.        Around a year or so ago, Greenday released a version of \\"Working class hero\\", which included Lennon singing in the outro. This song has great lyrics-perhaps Lennon's best. With just accoustic guitar accompaniment, Lennon is vitriolic and uses a swear word, but in the context, it is more art than gratuitous.        The last song I'd single out would be \\"Jealous guy\\". Perhaps smooth Brit pop group Roxy Music has the most famous version of this song. Lennon's version still stands up well. Features piano and whistling. A documentary I recently saw (\\"Stuart Sutcliffe: The Lost Beatle\\") speculated that this song was really about Lennon reflecting on causing the death of ex Beatle Stuart Sutcliffe: \\"I was dreaming of the past, and my heart was beating fast. I began to lose control. I began to lose control. I didn't mean to hurt you\\". Lennon was reported to have violently assaulted Stuart which may have caused Stuart to die at a later time due to complications. As I say, this is speculation. It adds an interesting twist to the meaning of the lyrics, which I always took on face value as being about a troubled romantic relationship.       As for the rest of the songs, some notes I made on some of them:    Love: reminds me a bit of Pink Floyd. Piano melody reminds me of the early Beatles period.     Power to the people: has a black, gospel choir sound. Features saxophone.    Cold turkey: about giving up drugs. Has a very deep bass, with a bluesy and very raw sounding lead guitar. Lennon screeches at the end-mirroring withdrawal pains, presumably.     Whatever gets you through the night: features saxophone, clapping. Not sure, but it seems to be mixed with another song as well. Has a ragtime piano sounding outro.     Borrowed time: features scat at the end.       John Lennon is a musician you can honestly call a \\"legend\\", so the album is aptly titled. Some minor quibbles: it would have been interesting to have some of Lennon's darker material, like \\"How do you sleep at night\\", which I've never heard before, but which was a vitriolic pot-shot at fellow ex Beatle Paul McCartney.  The inclusion of \\"Mother\\" is welcome...it's a vitriolic pot-shot at his mother-well, maybe more a pained lament than a vitriolic pot-shot. And lastly, I first heard \\"Real love\\" on the Beatles \\"Anthology\\" which aired on tv many years ago. Absolutely loved that song. One of the Beatles best. It was based on a Lennon solo song. I've heard two versions of that...one which really didn't do very much for me, and another version which is closer to the finished product released by the surviving members of The Beatles for \\"Anthology\\". That version is a glaring omission from this compilation. Otherwise, this is an excellent compilation.
B00104QSOM|4.0|Director P.T. Anderson has created a moumental but flawed film about one man's ambition as it comes into conflict with the concept of faith. Based on Upton Sinclair's novel Oil!, There Will Be Blood tells the story of independant oilman Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) as he struggles to get rich in turn of the century America.    Day-Lewis,channeling John Huston, gives a career defining performance as a man totally alone in his ambition to become rich. This film is a character study more than an action narrative. Daniel Plainview is a complex man with no friends, no sense of history and presumably no morals as he attempts to control his destiny in the growing oil business. When he comes into conflict with an evangelical preacher Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) true colors are shown and a fight to the finish is begun.    The performance by Day-Lewis won him a deserved Best Actor Oscar. Also of note is the great camara work by Richard Elswit and the unique musical score by Jonny Greenwood of Radiohead.    I viewed the two disc edition which features the film on disc one and special features on the second disc. The special features include 15 minutes of stills and research to a Greenwood score, two trailers and some deleted scenes. These extras run for about 30 minutes. The main feature here is The History of Petroleum (1923-27) a silent black and white film produced by Sinclair Oil and the US Bureau of Mines. This short is also scored by Greenwood.    This film is definately worth checking out but may be a better rental than purchase. One further note the packaging on this set is horrible. The discs are squeezed into cardboard sleeves that virtually insure scratching with repeated viewings.
B0019X3YXM|3.0|\\"My Sassy Girl\\" isn't a great movie, it was pretty predictable, and not completly empathetic, but it also isn't a bad  movie, by the end the predictable outcome and plotline was one that you will look forward to and probably feel (like I did) a bit moved with some of the ending dialogue.<br /><br />It answers the romantic version of the question, \\"What is my destiny?\\"<br />It is the story of a likable nice guy nerd, and a beautiful mentaly ill girl with a subsatnce abuse problem. What makes love work, what is needed to overcome loss and adversety, what is really living? That is the crux of the story, if that sounds interesting to you you might like this movie.<br />3 1/4 *
B00004RFCM|1.0|Item was defective.  Some episoldes would not play at all or just stopped in the middle.  I contacted vendor and was told to return for refund.  I mailed the item back and have not yet received a refund.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I agree with those reviews that focus on the production quality of this DVD set. Yes, it is better than R30 or Rio. This DVD holds a great significance since I went to see them in the Ahoy in Rotterdam the first of the 2 nights that they were here. To the surprise of everyone that came to those concerts there were a couple of A4s posted on doors saying that the concert was going to be filmed! That in itself added more to the great atmosphere that was already building inside.... Having this DVD just reminds me of the details you tend to forget after a while! The sound, the temperature, the atmosphere, the joy...    Now, when you watch the concert and the camera pans across the audience, you'll see every now and then a pole/stick with a red light on top making its way around the crowd. That's someone who is selling a very well known brand of beer!  (There are a number of them walking around throughout the duration of the concert).    As it is said in Dutch: \\"het was een unique ervaring - geweldig\\" (it was a unique experience - terrific).    P.S. - Enjoyed the extras very much. They were an integral part of the concert those nights.
B000HWZ5X8|5.0|Robert Plant - Manic Nirvana (1990)<br /><br />This is a very solid effort from Robert Plant. Many of the songs here totally rock out while at the same time maintaining their own individuality. No two songs sound the same - a great quality to be sure.<br /><br />My least favorite track is the opener \\"Hurting Kind (I've Got My Eyes On You).\\" It's pretty much a straight-up rocker, which is fine, but not so interesting. If you love \\"Tall Cool One\\" or, say, \\"Radar Love\\" then you'll love this one. The next two are more interesting. \\"Big Love\\" has a swinging swagger and \\"S S S & Q\\" rocks hard with attitude and pleading sexuality. You might not want to play either in front of your girlfriend if she's a die-hard feminist, know what I mean?<br /><br />From there we hear the beautiful, mostly acoustic \\"I Cried\\" which also bursts into full-on rocking out at one point. \\"She Said,\\" \\"Nirvana\\" and \\"Tie Dye on the Highway\\" are all excellent, sophisticated rockers. \\"Your Ma Said You Cried in Your Sleep Last Night\\" sounds like it might be a slight nod to Elvis, another singer with plenty of attitude and swagger. \\"Anniversary\\" is a slower, synth-propelled song that soon builds with a drum march and guitar solo - it's very compelling. The acoustic \\"Liars Dance\\" is one of the best on the album and recalls Led Zeppelin more than anything else on MANIC NIRVANA. The last song, \\"Watching You,\\" is quite intense with heavy synth, guitars, Middle Eastern influences and a forboding, steady drum pattern.<br /><br />Plant's singing is awesome throughout and his trademark solo sounds (righteous guitars, synths and female background vocals) are in full effect. Excellent production, with not one misplaced note. May in fact be one of his best despite being one of his least popular releases.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|My sister actually introduced me to this band with the single 'Crushcrushcrush' and after that 'Misery Business' Crushcrushcrush instantly grabbed me with its hard rock sound without being to hard, and its amazing bridge. Misery Business, with its brutal honesty and very catchy lyrics, swept me away. I have since fallen very, very hard in love with Paramore. I devoured Riot! and then All We Know Is Falling as well. I highly anticipate their release of their third album, hopefully to include 'Decode' used on the Twilight soundtract. Vocals are top notch, and the lyrics are very real and down to earth. Genuine questions asked like 'Why do we lie to hurt so much?' from That's What You Get. So many emotions come through on this record, combined with good guitar and amazing delivery, what is not to love?
B00026WU3M|4.0|Some of the songs on this album are a little lightweight and unsophisticated by Dylan's usual standards. Others sound a bit too similar. The gems, however, make up for these drawbacks. \\"The Man in the Long Black Coat\\" stands out for it's guitar work, seedy atmosphere and Dylan's lurching lyrical phrasing. Some people (like me) really like \\"Where Teardrops Fall\\" while \\"What Was It You Wanted\\" is a good song although far from unique. \\"Everything is Broken\\" is a great romp. And \\"Most of the Time\\" has to be the best song of the set (even though it appeared on the High Fidelity soundtrack - the same movie that showed disdain for any song used for such purposes!). It's the kind of song that will crush your insides if you have someone you broke up with that hasn't been completely expunged from your heart. Listening to it today, I don't think there's a bad song in the bunch. Not his most ingenious work, but very enjoyable nonetheless.
B001ED7C58|4.0|Having been a big fan of the books, and possibly a bigger fan of the movies, I was ecstatic when I received this album as a gift, and being a huge fan of Paramore, who included two songs on this album, was a massive plus for me. I'll give a little summery of each song on the track listing.  1. Super Massive Black Hole- Muse.  The song by Muse being on the track listing did not surprise me in the least. Meyer has stated more than once that she highly enjoys the band, and I thought the sound fit nicely. You have to pay attention to the lyrics, and read in depth to them in order to see how it fits though. Its not something immediately clear.  2. Decode- Paramore  Paramore defiantly lived up to my high expectations in this song. The one problem is that, in my opinion, the movie does not allow Bella and Edward to show the frustration they experience, stemming from the fact Edward cannot read her mind, and she can't understand why he won't accept that she wants to be with him, regardless of him being a vampire. Honestly though, I don't think ANY movie could have pulled that off. It was an amazing song, vocals and music both being top notch  3. Full Moon- The Black Ghosts  This song was used in the beginning of the movie, when Bella was leaving Phoenix and headed to Forks. As soon as I heard it in the theaters, I knew I wanted to hear more. I was very pleased to find that the tract provides a little bit of mood music, without being overbearing, but like many of the songs on this soundtrack, you have to really pay attention to understand the lyrics.  4. Leave Out All The Rest- Likin Park  I had heard this song on the radio a few times, but never really paid much attention to it. Its one of the highlights for me on the soundtracks, because it just perfectly describes how Edward hopes Bella will not hold him too accountable for the danger he puts her in. It was one of the tracts that I thought captured one of the chief moods in the book, rather than the film.  5. Spotlight (Twilight Mix)- Mute Math  This song is just as the title says. Its a mix of many of the moody elements, combined with a catchy lyrics and beat. Doesn't hold much stock as for what the lyrics mean for the film, but overall, fun to bob your head too.   6. Go All The Way (Into Twilight)- Perry Farrel  This was the song that was playing at the beginning of the prom scene, when Bella and Edward enter the gym and everyone is dancing. That is exactly what this little diddy is, a dance tract, and should be valued no more and no less to the soundtrack than that.  7. Tremble For My Beloved- Collective Soul   This is another tract that provides more mood music than anything else. The lyrics could work for the story line I suppose, but this song, I think, was used in the movie much more for its haunting notes and semi catchy guitar lick. Not a bad listen to. It fits with the mood of the album  8. I Caught Myself- Paramore  I can honestly say, as a very avid listener to this band, this was not one of their best songs. I just didn't think that Hayley Williams (Singer and chief lyricist for the band) put her heart into writing it. Like she didn't think it was all the good of a song, but they had to produce something, so this is what they ended up with. I will say that the lyrics do fit Edward's perspective, almost perfectly, but its less than what I expected of Paramore.   9. Eyes On Fire- Blue Foundation  Another song that lends its strength to the movie, not on a soundtrack. Its a good listen to, but only if you're in that kind of mood. The first time I listened to this album I was playing it while I was driving down the highway, going sixty five. It made my foot ease off the accelerator a bit. Whether it was meant to ease into the less rock part of the album, I'm not sure, but it defiantly eases the tone.  10. Never Think- Rob Pattison  As a player of guitar myself, I can very much appreciate the sweetness of the melody of the acoustic guitar. The lyrics are sweet and sad, but,you can't understand them very well. Sometimes you don't need to, and you can just let yourself go with the melody. Pattison, in my opinion, should stick to acting, rather than singing. Not to say his voice is bad, but I don't think that singing would be a wise career move for him.   11. Flightless Bird, American Mouth- Iron and Wine  This was probably the only song on the album that has not grown on me, then again, this is not really my style of music. Its got a sweet, soft melody, that's perfect for a slow dance, which is when this song was used, in the last scene as Edward and Bella were slow dancing at prom. It fits that scene, but as a stand alone tract on an album, I don't care for it.  12. Bella's Lullaby- Carter Burwell  One of the tracts I was most excited about, and probably the tract that deviates between the mood of the book and the movie the most. Not to say that it makes it a bad tract, because in honesty, its incredibly beautiful. I just don't see it as a lullaby. Maybe if you took out the orchestral instruments it could be, but you're stretching it. Either way, as it is on the soundtrack, its a beautiful ending to an overall amazing album. Normally soundtracks from movies do not satisfy me like this, and I was very pleased with it. A good listen to any day of the week.
0140120416|5.0|If one is going to learn Russian--by which I mean learn it well enough to actually carry on an intelligent conversation--one must start with the grammar.  Current products that promise easy, quick, learning of a language as difficult as Russian are simply marketing (expensive!)fantasy through huge advertising campaigns.  I set about to learn Russian seriously, and this book was a good first step. I also got Kenneth Katzner's Dictionary, which is the absolute best in the world, and something I use daily. After a year's work, I bought an inexpensive Pimsleur audio disk, so I could hear what these words actually sounded like, and this package is doing the job for me. This book intelligently starts at the beginning, with the alphabet. It shows how letters are both printed and written in cursive, and then, from the 1st lesson, it begins to introduce the important grammatical principles underlying this extraordinarily difficult language.  One quickly comes to appreciate how useless the exhorbitantly priced \\"interactive\\" programs are, which rely on the learning of many phrases.  All they are is an electronic version of a phrase book. The person who has invested their hard earned money in such courses will realize, the first time they try to talk to a Russian, that they have squandered their money.  In the first place, the words they have so carefully learned are virtually guaranteed to come back at them in a declined form, which, if they cannot recognize it, will sound like another word.  How could they possibly commincate without knowing the accusative, genitive, dative, nominative, prepositional or instrumental case endings?  A language like this is a serious undertaking (similar to classical Latin) and has to be approached with respect.  Brown's \\"Russian Course\\" is a sensible, down-to-earth, traditional grammar, with exercises, readings, self-tests, vocabularies, and a really concise declension chart at the end which is ABSOLUTELY useful and necessary!  Well worth the modest cost. Five star.  No way to go wrong if you have a serious desire to learn this language.
0765316897|4.0|Wow, a compelling and enjoyable fantasy series that acutally ends in three books. Highly imaginative, with dynamic characters and intersting plot that carry this series all the way through to the end. Highly recommend this series, as well as the author's other stand-alone book, Elantris. I'm definitely looking forward to future books from Brandon Sanderson.
B000GQT9LO|3.0|Joseph Heller's celebrated 1961 novel was translated to the screen in 1970 and then adapted to the stage by Heller himself in 1971. The novel is a brutal but hilarious satire of bureaucratic reasoning, achieving much of its impact through a series of distinctly literary devices that do not really translate to other media. In consequence, the 1970 film stank like a big dog on a hot summer day--and Heller's own 1971 stage adaptation isn't all that much better.<br /><br />Yossarian, a U.S. Army Air Forces B-25 bombardier, is stationed on an island off the Italy, from which military stages bombing runs in the waning days of World War II. Unfortunately for Yossarian and his fellows, Colonel Cathcart wants to become General Cathcart, and the only way in which he can think to distinguish himself is to continually raise the number of missions each man must fly before discharge. When Yossarian tries to have himself grounded by claiming insanity, he finds his request falls under regulation Catch-22: insane men cannot fly; you cannot be grounded without requesting it; requesting it demonstrates sanity. As the story unfolds through a wild array of characters and incidents, Catch-22 becomes ubiquitious, a regulation of such circular logic that it can be used to justify any and everything.<br /><br />Much of the novel's humor and impact arises from its cross-references, with Snowden a case in point. The character scarcely appears as a person in the novel, but he is constantly mentioned in the narrative and in his very brief appearance actually becomes the device by which Heller drives home Yossarian's motivations and the horrors of war. But this is a distinctly literary effect that does not translate into other media, and as a result the play's Snowden is shorn of the novel's Snowden's impact. Major Major is one of the novel's most memorable creations, and his reasons for wearing a silly disguise is truly hilarious--but these are never deeply explored in the play and consequently emerge as, well, silly.<br /><br />The result is a series of dialogue skits. The dialogue itself is very funny, much of it lifted directly from the novel, but the characters and situations lack context and as such lack impact. Although the rapid shifting of scenes and moments mirrors the novel itself, here it is more confusing than comic, for the scenes lack the framework that hold them so tightly together in the book itself. What finally emerges is a pale reflection of the original novel, and while it will make sense to those who have read the novel, it will probably leave those who have not more than a little slackjawed.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerll, silly.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|My son got this for Christmas and we just finished playing our first game. We absolutely LOVED it, but I'll say that the learning curve is pretty steep. The directions were vague in certain areas, so we muddled through it for awhile trying to figure everything out. As a result, our first game took about 3 hours to play! But it was a blast and we plan on playing it again tomorrow. Our only complaint is that the directions could have been better written. I did notice (towards the end) that you can go online and read addt'l rules and also play a tutorial if you want.
1451626657|5.0|I've always thought that people who don't like CATCH-22 are humorless fascists.<br /><br />Joseph Heller (1923-1999) was a poor Brooklyn kid who joined the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1942 and ended up on the Italian front, where flew at least sixty combat missions--most of which he described as \\"milk runs.\\"  Always interested in writing, he began to publish in the late 1940s and was well regarded as a short story writer.  In 1953 he began a piece that he thought would be short story or maybe a novella.  Eight years later in 1961, after considerable editing and a last-minute name change, it was a four hundred page-plus novel titled CATCH-22.  Reviews were originally mixed, but the book thrived on word-of-mouth, and pretty soon everybody was reading it and talking about it.<br /><br />CATCH-22 is extremely difficult to describe because it does not operate on a linear time line: the story is not told in sequence, but in what seems at first to be a random order of events.  Characters who were dead in one chapter are living in the next chapter; events that past in one chapter have not yet happened in the next chapter.  These characters and events swirl like a confusion of confetti--but as the novel progresses one perceives a pattern, and at the center of the pattern is a U.S. Army Air Forces B-52 bombardier named Yossarian, who is repeatedly stymied by an absurdity of military bureaucracy created and supported by a military regulation known as \\"Catch-22.\\"<br /><br />Catch-22 is essentially an unspecified double-bind rule that can be applied to virtually any situation at will because no one has actually seen the rule in written form.  The plot of the novel arises because Yossarian and his buddies have been required to fly an absurdly high number of missions and Yossarian's nerves are at the breaking point.  He should be grounded, but in order to be grounded he must ask to be grounded.  Since concern for personal safety is the process of a rational mind, asking to be grounded is evidence of sanity, and if he is sane he must fly however many missions his superiors require.  This bizarre, circular logic--which is reflected in the bizarre, circular nature of the narrative--is applied over and over throughout the book.<br /><br />The result is laugh-out-loud funny, particularly when the characters are factored into the story: characters such as Major Major Major Major, ex-PFC Wintergreen, Hungry Joe, Chief White Halfoat, Chaplin A.T. Tapman, General Dreedle, Milo Minderbinder, and numerous others are hilarious creations that stay in your mind years, even decades after the book is read.  But as the novel progresses it becomes increasingly hard to laugh at their predicaments, which become increasingly dark.  By the novel's conclusion, we are praying for Yossarian and his friends to escape, but damn few of them do.<br /><br />People who have been in the military seem to regard the novel as a satire on the military; it is, however, much broader than that, and it would be more accurate to describe CATCH-22 as a satire on bureaucracy in general.  The notion could just as easily be applied to business, to religion, to the government, and there is probably not a person living who hasn't experienced a Catch-22 moment within the past week or two.  Just recall the last time you tried to have your telephone bill corrected or asked about a questionable transaction on your bank statement and you'll probably know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />CATCH-22 is one of the handful of novels to which I seem to return every few years, and with each reading I find funnier, darker, and more memorable than before.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amason Reviewerf he is sane he must fly however many missions his superiors require.

1416562605|5.0|This book was easy to read and a great story. Aravind makes it interesting and throws a bit of humour in there which makes it enjoyable. A little bit similiar to 'A fine Balance', if you've read that, but not with the doom and gloom that A fine balance has.    Found it a bit of a page turner actually and finished it in 2 days. Excellent first novel.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This is THE BEST dramatisation of the Apollo program that I've seen.  Tom Hanks and his team have done an incredible job putting it all together.    I could say so much more but after reading some of the other reviews I see that it's aready been said.      All I will say is that if you are at all interested in learning about NASAs lunar program and the pioneering astronauts, watch this mini series.
0375842209|4.0|I love the style of this author as it grabs my attention. The topic isn't pleasant but it is a different perspective than the typical WWII book. I would definitely recommend this book.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. I am a big fan of Disney/Pixar movies and they have delivered another worthwhile movie for both young and old. I saw this movie in the theaters and already decided at that time I wanted to own it on blu-ray. The animation is incredible and Wall-E and Eve are too cute. I read some reviews that felt the message was delivered too strong, especially for many children but I feel that children look at movies different than adults. This movie is for both children and adults. It can be a eye opening experience for some that see the environmental impact humans can have with earth. I realize that some people may get offended at how humans are portrayed but if you focus too much on that then you will miss out on the beautiful relationship that grows between Wall-e and Eve and Wall-e's endearing, innocent, personality. I feel these types of movies become great classics because they do deliver a wonderful story yet maintain a sweet innocence that children love.<br /><br />I like that now some movies come with a digital copy or a regular dvd copy for the kids so you don't have to worry about the kids damaging the expensive blu-ray disc.Disney has also commited to taking full advantage of bd-live features so that kids can have plenty to do long after they have watched the movie 100 times.<br /><br />Overall I really enjoy how much Pixar/Disney includes in their blu-ray editions. So may other studios seem to not care to stuff their blu-ray editions with extras that will take advantage of the technology, disc capacity and bd-live. I look forward to future Disney blu-ray releases to add to my collection.
1400082773|5.0|Well, guess what? Barack Obama, our soon-to-be president, is human. In this beautiful autobiographical memoir, the author reveals himself in all his inner complexity, confusion, struggles, failures and successes. He recounts moving stories of his childhood; the one month he spent with his late father, at age ten; his confusion about his own identity; his ups and downs as a student, his Indonesian stepfather; his years as a community organizer in a decaying Chicago neighborhood; his pilgrimage to Kenya and meetings with relatives he'd never known. An unusual and varied life experience bringing together different worlds.<br /><br />If you're looking for clearcut answers you won't find them here. What you will find is a glimpse into a man's soul, his complexity, his sense of community, his humanness. If at times I couldn't keep up with all the characters and their relationships, it didn't matter. The important part is the network of interconnections, the complexity itself. And the struggle to find one's place in this network, generation after generation.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely, couldn't put it down, and recommend it highly. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|I already had the dvd of the song remains the same--but blu-ray is another way to get a better picture and sound.
B00000DHRZ|2.0|I have had a large background in music, and I rate albums based on how good they sound as a whole, not because an album has one or two great songs. I'm going to basically give you my rating of each individual song, minus the first track because it's literally 10 seconds long.    1. (no review)  2. Well... this is a really crappy way to start an album. There are way to many \\"falllllllllling\\"'s in this song. It's like they ran out of material to use for lyrics, so they replaced any interesting lyrics by rehashing the same word over and over. But don't worry, that's a minor complaint on my part. What really killed the song was how unoriginal it sounds all together. They aren't breaking any new ground, this kind of song has been done a million times before. This gets 1 star.  3. I'm not sure about anyone else out there, but this song has an incredibly similar theme to the one preceding it. Sure it's fast, but speed can't save a train wreck of a song. There really isn't any point in listening to it again once you've heard it the first time. This also gets 1 star.  4. Here's the single best song this album has to offer. Not much to say here that hasn't already been said. This was the album's hit, and it's worth giving multiple listens. I'd recommend buying this single instead of the whole album, but this still gets 5 stars.  5. And... back to the crap. Dex is really overusing the meaningless screaming on this album, it seems. At least there's harmony in it, but it doesn't save the song. Still gets 1 star.  6. Hardcore cover of an old song that everyone knows... and they butchered it. This is a disgrace, just skip it for the love of god. I'd rank it lower, but unfortunately it gets 1 star.  7. This is my personal favorite for the album. The lyrics are a bit iffy in some sections of the song, but it's a solid piece of music that all guys can relate to. Everyone ends up dating that one girl that we find it is completely insane. Come to think of it, it goes the other way too.5 stars.  8. I know a lot of people liked this song, but I really don't see why. It's decent, but nothing exceptional. I'll give it 3 stars.  9. This sounds similar to most of the other songs on the album, aside from being painful to listen to. I thought that the lyrics couldn't get any more uninspired... I was wrong. This gets 1 star.  10. I think I lost a few IQ points listening to this crap. It sounds like something the band put together last minute to extend the album's length. I dunno why they'd do that, considering it's only a two minute song anyway. It's the same theme they've been using since their first album, and it's been overused by far. My minimum rating is 1 star, so I have to give this song that.  11. This is actually a pretty funny song, and I find myself singing the first line from time to time. \\"My friend's got a girlfriend and he hates that bitch...\\" Anyway, I'll give this 3 stars just because it's an amusing little song that is decently memorable.  12. I have to say that this is above average. The bass line at the beginning is really catchy, and my favorite part of the song. The worst part is the chorus, but the good thing is that they didn't overdo it as much as everything else on the album. This song manages to stand out, so I'm giving it 4 stars.  13. Ah I see. THIS was the song put in to fill space. Don't even listen to it. Just stop the album after Americana so you can end with a good song. Trust me, you'll thank me later. This pointless song gets what it deserves: 1 star.    I averaged every song's rating together and came up with my rating of the album overall. Buy the three or four decent songs on Itunes, but don't waste your money on the whole thing.
B001NOMNZW|5.0|Honestly, High School Music fan or not, this movie is truly amazing. Of course, anyone who liked the first two will probably fall in love with this one, as it is, hands down, the best in the trilogy.  I think that even if you didn't see the first two or if you weren't particularity fond of them, you will like this one regardless because of what it deals with.  This movie is about something we all go through as senior in high school - saying good-bye to our friends after high school.  Addiotionally, it's nice to see a teen movie that doesn't revolve around sex, drugs, violence, and profanity. (I am aware many of you will argue with me that this is not exactly a film aimed at a teenage or young adult audience and that the viewing public expected for it is in fact little elementary school children simply because it is G-rated Disney movie, but to me, that makes no sense whatsoever. The movie talks about high school graduation, college applications, prom, the Ivy League universities, etc. Do you really think a 10-year-old will understand that?)<br /><br />The East High Wildcats decide to put on their final show together at their school: a musical about their twelfth grade experience.  It'll be a pretty unique musical because, for once, they won't have to play a character - they'll be playing themselves!  But due to her incredible intelligence, Gabriella, the female protagonist, is offered to skip her senior year in high school and go to straight onto college right away.  Will she accept Standard's offer, leaving her friends, boyfriend, and the musical behind?  Will Troy, the male protagonist, chose to continue with basketball or will he chose a career than involves acting? Will Sharpay win a scholarship to New York's Julliard University of Performing Arts or will her brother?  Will Ryan and Kelsi find true love?  Find out in this exciting conclusion to one of the world's greatest film series!  The only good thing recently produced by the screwed-up Disney Channel!  Yes I hate Disney Channel, Hannah Montana, Cory in the House, Jonas Brothers, and all of the other inappropriate teen shows they've decided to put on a children's channel.  But High School Musical is different.  It teaches both kids and teens a valuable lesson and it allows adults to revisit their past.  The plot is actually relevant to what many people feel and...it's a teenage musical!  You don't see something like that everyday!  Just watching Troy and Gabriella perform a beautiful waltz is reason enough to buy this film.  Also, the old fashioned music at the end proves that rap, hip hop, and pop isn't always what you'll see in a teenage film.<br /><br />The songs are as original, catchy, and wonderful as they are visually stunning! During \\"Scream,\\" the turning walls that represent Troy's confusion are spectacular!  The disappearing pictures on the wall in Gabriella's solo \\"Walk Away\\" were really quite sad.  The Statue of Liberty that shoots fireworks out of its head in \\"I Want It All\\" is amazing.  The sets in \\"A Night To Remember\\" will leave you with your mouth wide open.  \\"Right Here Right Now,\\" \\"Can I Have This Dance,\\" and \\"Just Wanna Be With You\\" are three incredible romance songs.  And, of course, Troy and Chad turning into little boys in \\"The Boys Are Back\\" was really cute.  That reminds, \\"Right Here Right Now\\" and \\"The Boys Are Back\\" are so of my favorites because of what they talk about: not wanting to grow up.  Anyway, n case you forgot or are too lazy to read the customer reviews for the HSM3 soundtrack, here are the songs:<br /><br />1. \\"Now Or Never\\" - Troy and the Wildcats basketball team<br /><br />2. \\"Right Here, Right Now\\" - Troy and Gabriella<br /><br />3. \\"I Want It All\\" - Sharpay and Ryan [A TRUE BROADWAY SONG!]<br /><br />4. \\"Can I Have This Dance?

That also lets you see an important-looking lady giving Ryan a newspaper with him and Sharpay on the cover.

0765356139|5.0|Plot, Magic, Political intrigue, war, love, despair, triumph. What more cane you ask for? Anyone who loves fantasy as I do, MUST read this series.     Sanderon was a largely unknown author until recently when he was selected to finish Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. That of course led me too Brandon Sanderson to investigate his skills as a writer of fantasy and the Mistborn series. I can already say, (not having read Hero of Ages even) that the the Wheel of Time is in good hands.     That being said, I can only express my excitement about the potential of future work that Sanderson will produce. Read the Mistborn series. It's GREAT!
0956010903|5.0|I asked for this book for Christmas, and when it showed up my door I was ecstatic. To me, this book kept the magic coming. It's beautiful and authentic looking, and the Hogwarts outer book is great for storing other things in.<br /><br />I've had this book for nearly a week and have not finished it! I finished The Half-Blood Prince in three hours. I simply do not want to read it and be done - that's how much it means!<br /><br />My only complaints (that aren't crucial enough to lower it a star) are that:<br /><br />a) It smells funky. Like the new car smell, but odder. Because it appears old, I wish it to smell old and musky, which I'm sure it will in due time!<br /><br />b) The velvet bag that the actual Tales came in was great, but the ribbon holding it together slipped and the knot came undone.<br /><br />Otherwise, I am in love with this book as I am in love with the series! Some of my friends may call me a dork, but to me, there is nothing better than a book written well.<br /><br />Rowling has completed the chronicles masterfully, and kudos to Amazon for making this available to the public!
B001GQACGO|3.0|I just don't care for this cd. To be perfectly honest I didn't care for 'Single Ladies' until I saw the choreography in the video. Amazing what a visual and constant airplay on the radio can do.  Now I can't get that silly song out of my head. (lol)    I get the whole 'good girl/bad girl'-'alter ego vs real person' dichotomy but I'm not even sure it's believable here. 'I am...' tries to go deeper but both (i am and Sasha Fierce) are just playing to mainstream demands.   The main thing that I take issue with is the idea (put forth by Beyonce) that this cd is an 'oh-so-personal-dear-to-her-heart' release.  I consider that to be something of an insult as the lyrical content in some of these songs are as vapid and juvenile as ever...    I do not wish to believe that she is this empty-headed. I think it's more likely that her comments were little more than a marketing ploy.In which case, I can salute her for being a crafty woman and playing 'her part' well.  Anyway, it's not as though I expect Shakespeare from any of these artists--but...well, I'll put it like this:  I just can't get with Beyonce's music anymore. I don't like her sound. I'll listen to the music in the car if it so happens to come on the radio. But to include it in my cd collection?  No.  I've been into Destiny's Child and Beyonce since they first came out. These days, I have to wonder which demographic she's targeting because I feel as if I have seriously outgrown her.  B'Day was better, in my opinion.   'Destiny Fulfilled' was better than both (and way more mature in content).    But---on another note, it'd probably be best not to look too deeply into this. This ain't a Tchaikovsky piece, here! (lol)  I think that she's serious about her craft and is being true to herself.  As I see it, Beyonce is taking 'risks' but she's still going to stick with what works. Of course she *could* put together this ultra-personal and deep cd with a bunch of boring and emmotional songs but hell, it has to be marketable too. These artists record music for themselves but they want ppl to buy from them, as well.  Or what would be the point?    Why else would they involve themselves in restaurants, clubs, clothing & accessory, lines, shoes, movie projects and various other business ventures if money wasn't the bottom line?  ...because at the end of the day, Beyonce is a BRAND, this is her BUSINESS--and she's going to try to make money the best way she knows how.   I can understand that. She's a self-made woman and I do respect her.    Anyway those are my thoughts. The latest effort is alright. I just don't care for it.
1573226521|3.0|If someone hadn't thrown this book in with a bunch of gift books, I would have never read it.  If I hadn't been working my way through said box while recuperating, I wouldn't have read it.  If I had anything at all more promising to do with my time, I would have dumped this book in the garbage after 20 pages.  But seeing as I didn't dump it, I didn't have to shell out my hard earned cash for it and I was momentarily incapable of doing anything more than reading - I'm glad that I didn't miss the gore at the end and the quirky psychotic interludes of our main character that made the whole book have any redeeming interest.<br /><br />Bottom line - The book's not a keeper, but if you can spare some time in the library on a rainy saturday, open it up somewhere for the last third and enjoy the good bits.  Otherwise, this book's all bran and few raisins.
B0011FDVKE|4.0|I really liked Tift Merrit's previous CD, \\"Tambourine,\\" and bought \\"Another Country\\" as soon as I saw it on a display at a store.  Her voice truly is gorgeous, and the lyrical content of her songs on this CD is very personal and accessible.  That being said, I must admit that I was a little disappointed the first several times that I listened to \\"Another Country\\" because of how understated it is--it didn't just reach out and grab my attention as much as I had expected that it would.  After a few repeated listens, however, I learned to more fully appreciate its understated elegance. I highly recommend this artist and CD. \\"Tambourine\\" also is very good.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|Mr. Iger of Walt Disney World Companies.<br />There are many movies we would liked to have seen but, they do not have ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the menu set up.  Why is it that a movie being distributed in the United States of America has spanish or some other language for subtitles in the menu set up?  The PRIMARY language in America is ENGLISH.  As we are hearing impaired and must have ENGLISH closed captions in the menu set up.  I guess we will miss a lot of the movies produced by your companies.<br />Without ENGLISH CLOSED CAPTIONS FOR THE HEARING IMPAIRED as part of the movie menu set up, we will not be able to purchase particular movies of interest. You lost a sale on this one and I am sure as well as others in the future.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This is the ultimate trio rock album<br />full of great riffs, singing & playing.<br />Robin Trower known for his guitar work<br />but not really his songs but this album<br />is just a monster. Many compare him to<br />Hendrix but I was never a fan of either<br />more into more of Deep Purple Burn or<br />that type of rock but my brother had<br />this on 8-track & I loved these songs.<br />I just got this & can't stop listening.<br />My favorite Day of the Eagle & Lady Love<br />are just killers & any rock fan should<br />have in collection. Bridge of Sighs is<br />brilliant & Little Bit of Sympathy are<br />classics. The singer is just fantastic.<br />His vocals is like Paul Rodgers but some<br />deep groovy sound that just kills. One of<br />the most best singers of the 70's. The<br />bonus tracks like Aletha are great too.<br />If you like trio hard rock this is for you.
B001O7JHVG|4.0|TANGO & CASH is more a parody of macho buddy pictures than an adventure story, with everything played for laughs. There are several tons of beefcake, muscle cars, a demolition derby, monster trucks, stupid jokes, an extraordinarily hammy performance by Jack Palance as a master crook, and Terri Hatcher as a stripper. What more could you want? My only real complaint is that there is not an original scene in it and Hatcher doesn't get enough screen time. I hope that the studio does justice to it on Blu-ray because it is just the sort of action film that would benefit most from such a presentation.
B000QUCNXG|2.0|This is a fantastic book but suggest you might want to buy the paper version.  My Kindle version is literally riddled with typos and missing words.  This is the first book I bought for my new Kindle and I'm sorely disappointed.  I hope this is not indicative of all Kindle books.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|I know for too often you were disappointed by your favorite artist's next release following the exquisite one you fell in love with.    This is not one of those albums. In fact, it may very well be Dido's best one so far. Wonderfully balanced and emotionally intense...    Buy it now. You'll thank me for it later.
0393325172|4.0|It is curious that this novel should come with a \\"movie tie-in\\" cover, since the plots of the book and the film have virtually nothing to do with each other!  On the other hand, the movie and this book are perfectly complimentary - Patrick O'Brien's world of the British Navy in the Napoleonic era is amply described in this book, and I'm sure the makers of the movie were amply inspired to provide an equally realistic depiction on screen.    Another curiousity of this entry into O'Brien's series is that the book really focusses on a trio (rather than a duet) of characters.  Jack Aubrey is the titular Master and Commander of a small naval ship, HMS Sophie.  She is ordered on a cruise to attack enemy (in this case, Spanish and French) shipping.  Along for the ride is landlubber Stephen Maturin, a penniless physician forced to join the navy as the Sophie's surgeon (i.e. amputator).  He and Aubrey strike up a fast friendship based on mutual regard and a love of music.  The third main character is John Dillon, the Sophie's lieutenant.  Like Aubrey, he's seen his share of action and is advancing through the naval ranks.  Unlike Aubrey, he is morose, humourless, and holds a dark secret from his Irish upbringing.    O'Brien does two very clever things in this novel.  First is the use of Maturin as a landlubber on a naval craft for the first time.  His questions allow exposition by the other members of the crew regarding sailing, naval affairs, gunnery, etc.  The second is the conflict between the laid-back good humour of Capt. Aubrey and the intense and humourless Lt. Dillon, spotlighting the potential differences in attitude and command style in different officers of the Royal Navy.    The plot is mainly secondary.  We see the introduction of Maturin and Aubrey for the first time.  We have a successful cruise by the Sophie during which she captures several prizes and through which the mutual admiration between Aubrey, Maturin, and Dillon grows.  We then have conflict with Aubrey's superior (triggered by, but not limited to, Aubrey's attentions to the superior's wife), which leads to loss of cruising privilege and.... but I won't go on.  The fun of the book is the evocation of the era, in all its glory but also in all its faults and inhumanities.  I look forward to the rest of the series!
031606792X|5.0|I would have to say. After seeing the movie Twilight. I was totally convinced that I had to read the books. The movie was great, but once i got to Twilight it just got even better. I had the first one done in 2 days tops. A week later I got New Moon...took me 2 days again. I got Eclipse for Christmas, and 2 days later that was one ended too. All of the books just surprised me in every aspect. I was sooo happy to of found such a great author such as Stephanie Meyer. Now I just finished Breaking Dawn, the last and final book of the Twilight Saga. It was definitely not was i was expecting, but AMAZING!  If you are into Sci-Fi, mystery, and vampires. This is definitely for you. I recommend it to anyone.
1595141979|5.0|This book deserves MAD props. I mean, seriously. To read it was draining and at times so disheartening so to write it must've taken a great deal of strength. You have to dig deep, really connect with those sort of emotions or they WILL NOT come across. Believe me, I know. I will admit to skimming here and there, but only on the parts that had to do with her actually finding out about being Shadow Kissed. It was dull for me and I was so much more consumed with everything else that was happening that I just couldn't bring myself to invest in it, ya know. In the end, I'm glad I didn't but those reasons are spoilers that I refuse to post. At any rate, I loved this book. It's the only book, ever, to actually bring me to tears at the end. I've been hooked from the beginning and will remain devoted to this series. Well worth the time, readers, well worth the time.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|This band goes far beyond the EMO hole they have been shoved into. This album is just another example of their versatility. I can always count on Fall Out Boy to deliver straight up melodic sucker punches. Patrick Stump's voice is a gleaming gem in a rusty pile of cookie cutter singers that clog up the airwaves.   Pete Wentz couldn't write dull lyrics if he was paid to. I don't care what you think...just listen to this band.
1904920233|5.0|I'd never heard of the restaurant chain before and really stumbled across this cookbook while looking for a Christmas present to accompany an udon bowl for my father.  I bought the book based on the reviews and now that I've seen it and flipped through it, I'll be buying one for myself.  What a fantastic cookbook!  The pictures are gorgeous and the recipes sound intriguing.  None have been tried as of yet, but several have been drooled over.      The book is divided into sensible sections - meat, chicken, seafood, veggie, dessert, and juice (juice recipes!).  Simple to read, easy to follow.  I'm looking forward to giving several of these a whirl.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|I had first seemed this film in Prague and has become my old time favorite but had never seemed the director's cut which has brought closure to the Helena and Salvatore's love saga. I think this version is a must have for any fan of this masterpiece. If you do not have the director's cut; please get it, you will be treat it to a hold new dimmension of the director's point of view on what love and friendship really is.    Bravo, Bravo, Bravo.....
0316017922|5.0|This book is not just about what makes the ultra-successful, well, ultra-suceessful.  Gladwell also discusses why some of those who \\"should\\" be successful (ones with super high IQs, for example) do not succeed.  The cumulative effects of socioeconomic advantage he described in the book is rather startling and worthy of further contemplation.
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Unrated for a reason:  This movie is NOT for minors. Graphic sexual situations.<br /><br />That being said:  Shortbus is a MUST see.  The characters wind their way through difficult situations in their lives using very unique personal relationships to emerge renewed, if not unscathed, on the other side.  Both funny and thought provoking.
1416562605|4.0|I have finished this book in four days! Don't know if I am having a reading spurt but this book went fast. I enjoyed most of it the parts I didn't like was his cheap shots at people of a different religion. Otherwise this book is hilarious it is set in india and is story of murder, and hope. I rarely read books like this and it has opened my mind to some other possibilities.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Awsome movie to own on blu ray at a scale of 1 to 10 I'll get it a 9. It would have been a 10 if it wasn't for that ending. The picture quality is a 5 out of 5 stares and the sound is really good to.
0393307050|5.0|Patrick O'Brian is one of my favorite authors.  I am in a seagoing service and was serving aboard my third ship when my Captain, who knew I was an avid reader, handed me a copy of Master and Commander to read.  I was hooked.  I saved a little of my liberty money to buy each successive book in the series every time we pulled into port and I made it to a book store.  These books are amazing and have a place of honor on my book shelf.    Master and Commander is book one of Patrick O'Brian's 21 book adventure.  If you have seen the movie you have not seen the story.  The book is so much more.  The two main characters live during the Napoleonic Wars in Great Britain.  Jack Aubrey is a British Navy Lieutenant that gets command of his first ship, the Sloop Sophie.  Therefore he is a Master and Commander.  He meets a Irishman on the Port Mahon on the island of Minorca in the Mediterranean named Stephen Maturin.  His is a physician who Jack befriends through a love of music, and convinces Stephen to try a life at sea as a Navy Surgeon.   The two become fast friends and form a relationship much like the odd couple.  Jack is a brilliant sea Captain but on land blunders his was through money, politics and women.  Stephen is an intelligent philosopher of nature and in many ways in studying people.  Through both of there eyes we get to experience life in the Royal Navy.  Master and Commander follows the many cruises of the Sophie through the Med as Jack catches many \\"prizes\\" and earns quite a reputation, only to be outdone by his affair with his superior officers Wife!       The sea battles are vivid and real.  The life drama is amazingly detailed and in many cases I feel a connection with Jack and Stephen.  This book is so much more than the movie and only the first chapter in an amazing yarn spun by the late Patrick O'Brian.    I would have gladly given this book and the rest of the series 6 stars.
B001BR5F4C|5.0|If you like intense and gory fight scenes, you will love this movie. I am not huge into fighting movies normally, but this one involves rockin' girls kicking some *@$ so I loved it!!!    If you have a blu ray player, it is even better the the original is still good. ENJOY!!!
B001GGWFFA|5.0|Mezmerizing . . . breathtaking . . . reminds me all over again why I fell in love with Pink Floyd decades ago . . . because of David Gilmour. Three CDs and two DVDs to settle the soul. The last work of Rick Wright. Don't pass this up.

B001ED7C58|4.0|I love almost all of the songs on the soundtrack, they are amazing! I was disappointed in the lullaby, though. It wouldn't put me to sleep and doesn't sound as romantic and soft as I imagined it, I almost would have rather just had them find a classical piano song already composed instead of what they wrote. A lot of the songs were great and I can't count how many times I've listened to the CD, and it fits with the movie, but not necessarily with the book.
B000TJBNFI|5.0|I purchased this movie for a Christmas present for my son. We have both enjoyed watching this DVD. Great discount given by Amazon.
0316010669|3.0|I had heard about this book for a long time, so I raced on over to the website and took a long, hard--oh, I mean a short, easy blink at it.   I'm not sure what it's about, but I'm sure I don't want to read it.  Well, I mean, I did read it, but just really, really fast.   It was great! By the way, since I both did and didn't read it, and chances are its an average book, I gave it a 3!  Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B001CZJKS0|2.0|The beautiful people of Anchor Bay, scions of releasing lost slasher gems and coming out with deluxo packages galore for the fanatic, really dropped the ball with the Myers project.<br /><br />Halloween has been released approximately 97 times in the last year alone, so you'd think Anchor Bay would finally just do it and include every stinking version, every extra, and every format in this thing, and do it right.  DVD and Blu-Ray, and VHS, too.  What about every format it's ever been released on, ever?  I'm serious.  Enough is enough.<br /><br />But it's not.  As several have already pointed out, Anchor Bay slapped this baby together with every bit of product they have rights to.  So you have the Extended Cut (aka the TV Version), and you have the documentary 25 Years of Terror, and then you have...Halloween 4 and Halloween 5, just thrown in there because...Anchor Bay has the rights.  You don't get all of the extras from the previous DVD releases of Halloween, though you do get the Blu Ray (which was already separately released).  And including H4 and H5 without the far better H2 (and even the insanity of H3) makes this plain silly.  I guess they figured it was the 20 anniversary of Halloween 4, too, which I'm surprised isn't getting a separate box set of its own, complete with version four mask.  And the mask?  Come on, it's no good...this thing is plain cheesy.  A replica knife would have been better, even a pair of coveralls, but not this thing.<br /><br />No, this is not the Holy Grail of Halloween boxes that you'd think a 30 anniversary would warrant (though they did do a nice 25 year thingee...five years ago).  Stick with the Divimax version of the original, and the widescreen version of part II.  Would recommend this only if you find it on a (big) sale (it's overpriced) and don't own two or more of the versions here.  Plus you can keep the mask.  Even a Loomis raincoat would have been more useful.
B00003000M|5.0|I heard this album while on a catamaran in the Virgin Islands and loved it so much I just had to purchase it.  Whenver I hear it, it takes me back to the Caribbean, with remixes of Bob's classics.  It's a great album.
0439023483|5.0|It took me a while to pick up this book because I'm not too fond of post-apocalyptic/sci-fi literature.  However, once I started, I couldn't stop.  The main character is immediately likeable and relatable.  She has this inner strength that you just have to admire - this no nonsense, get-the-job-done attitude that really shows her maturity.  And yet, you know she is still a teenager.  You can't help but feel sorry for the circumstances which deny her and others the joys of youth. Fortunately, though the districts are down, they are not yet out.   Collins is great at developing Katniss, as the flashbacks and her observations really show how they shaped her identity and gave her strength.         This makes it a pleasure to have Katniss as the narrator, despite the horrifying circumstance of her situation. The story is not rife with misery, pain, and violence - there is quite a bit of dry humor that lightens up the mood and prevents the reader from going into a depression.  That is not say the story is not dark - it is; extremely dark.  Besides the despicable nature of the Games, the dark part of humanity is manifested brutally.  There are moments of great agony and  sadness, but a few particular scenes also give hope.      This is a story about the struggle to remain human in spite of the efforts from others to take it away.  Katniss performs her own rebellion in deliciously clever ways but at the same time, you still feel her pain and anger towards the unjustness of it all.  \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a fascinating look into what \\"enternaiment\\" can mean, reconciling the need for survival and morality, and the questions of government and community.    By the end of the book, the year's Hunger Games have finished, but many issues remain unresolved and many questions unanswered.  Most notably: how can one person possibly take down an entire empire?  The difficulty will be in how realistically the issues will be resolved.  I am truly looking foward to the rest of the trilogy.If you want a series that offers suspense, well-drawn characters, thought-provoking insights, and a mesmerizing story, I highly recommend \\"The Hunger Games.\\"

It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.\\"<br /><br />I suppose I'm not really the target audience for this book, but I saw it at the library and was curious. I read the Harry Potter books and enjoyed them and thought Rowling's latest collection might provide some new insight to the world she creates in her best-selling series.<br /><br />The book contains 5 fairy-tale-like stories with commentary by the late Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore. The only story with any real bearing on the Harry Potter lore will be the familiar \\"Tale of the Three Brothers\\" which is also found in the last book of the Harry Potter series. (It might actually appear earlier, I'm not sure)<br /><br />In addition, the commentary adds little to the world of Harry Potter as anyone familiar with the series will not need an explanation concerning the animosity between the pure-blood and the muggle-born or the difference between an Animagus and someone who has performed a Transfiguration spell. There's nothing wrong with the book, but there's nothing especially interesting about it either.

B000DWMN2S|5.0|Life is not all sad and tragic.  Neither is it sunshine and butterflies every day.  I love films that take the balance of life--its griefs, joys and absurdities--and present them in a way that enables us to see ourselves and our own lives.<br /><br />Elijah Wood once again finds a role in which he can shape-shift into a character who is decidedly not like him, yet he makes that character real.  In fact, all the actors in this film--including the dog--give poignant and profound performances.  (Ohhh, Grandpa!!!)  This is a wonderful little film.

0375826726|5.0|Paolini's first book in the series, Eragon, was a great story told to create a premise.  In the subsequent books, Paolini has built several histories on this foundation; we have spent time with elves and dwarves, not just superficially as they appear to carry the plot forward, but as individuals of depth.  I love that.<br /><br />As the books have progressed, so has Paolini's writing.  He slowly unfurls his tales now, not as a youth, but as a master story teller.  I know he has come under some undeserved and inordinately severe criticism because of his age.  No worries, Chris; turn the other cheek and keep writing.  You have a tremendous fan base out here--including those of us who are in our fifth decade....
B001EOQWF8|4.0|My kids love the movie and it is great.  The only problem is that it seems to freeze for a few seconds on one of the scenes in space.  I think the disc might be bad as it is a brand new Sony BDP-S550 player.  Have seen other reports of this.  Maybe the movie has too much DRM.
0385338694|5.0|I absolutely adore Sophie Kinsella and began reading her books just a few months ago. This book is simply fun and enjoyable to read. She creates female characters who are smart and determined- no weak minded women here!<br />I will continue to read this author over and over again.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Cute movie! the dvd case is entirely paper. I'm thinking it has to do with Disney living up to the theme of the movie of being environmentally friendly.
B000WC39ZY|3.0|I really wanted to love \\"New York, New York\\", but, I guess I am not an intellectual movie watcher.  Gritty \\"real life-like\\" stories do not entertain me.  BUT, the music, costumes and sets tip the balance to \\"like\\".  I understand what Scorsese wanted to accomplish and he succeeded.  DeNiro's character is so very unlikeable; it is difficult to root for his success. Minnelli's character is such a doormat, I just want to shake her and say \\"Snap out of it!\\"  I guess the movie's point is there are no real \\"happy endings\\", they are reserved for the MGM musicals of the 1950s.  This realism might be artistic but not entertaining.  If I want \\"real\\", I would stay home and watch real people doing real things for free.  Liza's musical numbers brought the movie up a star.  The special features told me some things I never knew about the film, but the Scorsese commentary would be better served in a separate interview, NOT running through the film.  He was so intent on convincing us he was an \\"artist\\", it got boring.    Granted, the characters should never be together and I do not want a \\"sappy ending\\", but after several hours, I really wanted to like someone in the movie.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Walk The Line is one of the best biopics I've ever seen. We get outstanding performances from Joaquin Phoenix as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as June Carter. Look also for a strong showing by Ginnifer Goodwin as Johnny Cash's first wife, Vivian. Waylon Payne also acts well as Jerry Lee Lewis. The plot moves along nicely even though there is little time spent on Johnny's childhood and his stint in the military; and the cinematography is well done.<br /><br />When the film begins, we get a brief glimpse into the main themes that ran through Johnny's life when he was a very young boy growing up in the South. His father Ray Cash (Robert Patrick) was rather cold toward him and became even colder still when Johnny's younger brother Jack (Lucas Till) died after an accident with a chainsaw. After what seems to have been a brief period of time in the military, Johnny marries his sweetheart Vivian and tries to make ends meet as a door-to-door salesman. However, Johnny's efforts in sales just didn't work out--but when he and a couple of his buddies get a chance to record a record for Sun Records things finally begin to look bright for Johnny and his young family.<br /><br />Of course, complications ensue. Johnny spends time on the road--in fact, he spends a lot of time on the road and after he meets June Carter on the road his marriage to Vivian slowly but surely begins to crumble. Vivian tries hard to get Johnny to stay at home more and focus on his children; but Johnny never seems quite able to do that and after quite a few years they divorce.<br /><br />Johnny pursues June Carter even though she marries another man; and he never quite gets over his poor relationship with his father. After time, Johnny's addiction to amphetamines also takes a toll on his career.<br /><br />Will Johnny be able to finally convince June Carter to marry him? How does his relationship with Columbia Records go while he has all his personal problems? Just in case you're not familiar with the story of Johnny Cash, I'll leave these questions and more for you to find out as you watch this excellent flick.<br /><br />I certainly think the storyline should have continued after 1968; Johnny lived and did much more with his life and career between the years 1968 and 2003 when he passed away. However, the story is quite strong and the ending titles do give you a pretty good idea of what happened to Johnny and June Carter in general.<br /><br />The DVD comes with quite a few deleted scenes and there is an optional running commentary with co-writer and director James Mangold. Great!<br /><br />Johnny Cash fans will love this biopic which is rather good despite a minor flaw here and there. I was very impressed that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon performed all of their songs without any dubbing! Johnny Cash was a good human being and an exceptionally talented man who deserves to have his life portrayed in a biopic. People who like biopics will also enjoy this film. It's a keeper!these questions and more for you to find out as you watch this excellent flick.    I certainly think the storyline should have continued after 1968; Johnny lived and did much more with his life and career between the years 1968 and 2003 when he passed away. However, the story is quite strong and the ending titles do give you a pretty good idea of what happened to Johnny and June Carter in general.     The DVD comes with quite a few deleted scenes and there is an optional running commentary with co-writer and director James Mangold. Great!    Johnny Cash fans will love this biopic which is rather good despite a minor flaw here and there.

A friend introduced me and i really liked the first cd. This one has songs that are a little too lovey dovey for me. She creates an image of break ups and first hand experiences and she really speaks from her own heart. Nice job taylor!

1400095204|5.0|This is the type of sweeping and heartfelt epic novel that tends to be overhyped by critics, but in this case the rave reviews are more than justified. Ms. Adichie has created a beautifully written and far-reaching work of historical fiction that capably explores crucial themes, and covers a historical era and place that will be little known to western readers. Adichie follows her well-drawn characters through the Nigeria of the 1960s, culminating in the doomed struggle for independence in Biafra and its cruel defeat by the European-backed Nigerians. Readers who disdain typical egghead praise for themes of post-colonialism, race, and class (not to mention the usually over-aggrandized \\"love and war\\") can ignore their fears because Adichie's exploration of these crucial themes is never heavy-handed. She achieves subtle yet hard-hitting insight into the horrors of war - particularly the divisive propaganda, ethnic strife, and false jingoism - via excellent characters whose spirits are tested by incredible hardship. This passionate and empathetic novel is destined to become a classic that easily transcends stereotypes, and the reader will learn about the complex nature of Nigeria and its peoples as well.

0307277887|2.0|I cannot believe that the showtime writers created such an extraordinary show from this book. As stated in other reviews, this book continually repeats dexters conflicting inner thoughts to the point where it gets overly redundant. The writing is poorly written and it hardly describes the man that is Dexter. This is contrary to how the showtime program perceives Dexter. If you have seen the show, do not even bother with the books. The ending was the worst part of this novel. It seemed like the writer just got lazy at the end and put a few things together to get ready for his next novel. I would write more to vent about the horrible ending but then I would spoil the book for the readers who still are interested in reading it. Overall, I gave the book two stars because I thought it was a great concept with a great plot. Unfortunately, Lindsay could not put a structure to it. But fortunately the showtime writers found a way to put this great concept into a brilliant television series.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I own the regular DVD version of Band of Brothers and I plan to purchase the Blu-ray version as well. First I have to say that I am a WWII buff and have recently visited Normandy (including Ste-Mère-Église and Brécourt Manor) and the extermination camp in Auschwitz, Poland. Most of the WWII films made to this day are cheesy and while they are meant to explore and show what happened during the war, the bad acting (e.g. The Longest Day) and lack of financial means these movies generally suffer from cannot possibly render justice to the WWII history. Enter Band of Brothers. It must be said that Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg had ZERO financial interest in the making of this series (unlike Saving Private Ryan) and truly wanted to portray these events as faithfully as possible just for the sake of educating the viewing public. The veterans who have seen the series and are part of it have all approved it (except for a couple of events that didn't necessarily involve the 101st but still took place), I myself have spoken with many specialists who confirm the authenticity of the storyline, and it is easy to verify these events and how they happened just by surfing the web and reading a few books. Finally, a WWII reference piece! I have to wonder what would motivate anyone to qualify this masterpiece as abysmal filmmaking. Indeed, Band of Brothers is the finest WWII \\"commercial\\" film ever made.

B00177Y9ZC|4.0|I've become addicted to reading fan reviews before I see any movie. This movie had such bad reviews from fans (averaging to about 3 stars)that I didn't see it until lastnight. PLEASE WATCH THIS. I don't understand why so many people had problems with the movie because I thought it succeeded on every level; the directing was awesome, acting/actors very good, locations were amazing and the script was very well written for an action movie (usually action movies succeed in the visual arena with explosions, special effects etc. but fail in dialogue and character development. This one managed to succeed in both.) People complained because there was either too much character development/ dialogue or as one person put it 'talking points,' or that there wasn't enough of a back story. I think its obvious that the second will continue into the backstory as to the 'whys' and 'whos' of the movie. Please watch it yourself and then post your own review.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|My parents watched LONESOME DOVE when I was about three. Of course, then I was too young to grasp a television miniseries. But when I was about thirteen of fourteen, I watched it (i'd always heard it was good). I was amazed at the storyline and many times I weeped. It's my favorite movie....period!
1402210086|5.0|I've really been enjoying all the Georgette Heyer re-releases that Sourcebooks has been putting out. This is the third one I've read (along with The Reluctant Widow [review] and Faro's Daughter [review]) and I can now say for certain that Heyer is an amazing author. I just can't believe it took me this long to read her novels!    I think that Cotillion is my favorite Heyer novel so far. The plot is fun enough, but it really is the characters that make this book. Kitty is sweet and her schemes are amusing. It is clear what she intends from the beginning of the novel, but it is fun to watch her plans unfold and unravel before her eyes. I also love how considerate she is: she is determined to help others, while being unsure of her own fate.    However, it was Freddy that really stole my heart in this novel. I love how he takes care of Kitty, how he goes along with her plans even though they are not his first choice. I enjoyed reading about how sweet he really is, how he does things he really would rather not and comes to Kitty's rescue time and time again, all because he is a gentleman and a good person. You could say I have a bit of a crush on Freddy - he reminds me of my husband!    Cotillion is completely fun and entertaining. I was completely hooked the whole time, hoping against hope that the novel turned out the way I wanted it to. If you haven't read any Heyer, this is a great place to start; if you have read Heyer and enjoyed her novels, read Cotillion as soon as you can! You'll definitely enjoy it.    4.5 stars rounded up to 5
031606792X|5.0|As you can probably see there are many different opinions on Breaking Dawn. I LOVED it! I loved the first three books and I am now currently rereading Twilight. At first I was a little taken aback by some of the events in BD, but I never put the book down. This book ended the series in the way it was always intended to be. The last paragraph of the last page sums up the series perfectly.   Bella and Edward's love is what this series is all about. I'm thrilled that I had the chance to read the conclusion to their epic love story.

I've sent several e-mails and all I get is \\"it's been shipped\\". This experience ruined my Christmas. The DVD was a grab bag gift for my office party. It was most embarrassing to show up without the requested gift. I am so disgusted with Amazon and DVD Legacy.
B0017I0KVI|1.0|\\"Twaddle\\", according to dictionary.com, is defined as \\"trivial, feeble, silly, or tedious talk or writing.\\"  Therefore, I think it the perfect word to describe this disgrace of a book.  This book does not stand on its own; you must know Jane Austen's Emma well to feel comfortable with the story line.  The premise of its being a \\"diary\\" is nothing short of ludicrous.  Can you imagine Mr. Knightley taking the time to write out conversations full of trivial things like like Emma saying \\"I am so pleased to see you.  We were just saying, were we not, Papa, that we hoped Mr. Knightley would look in.\\"    If you want to write out inane dialogue like that, don't make it a diary.  Mr. Knightley is a very busy man running a large estate with many tenants and deeply involved in Parish business, yet he is sitting down at night to write out details in his diary that he sat next to Miss Taylor.  It is ridiculous to think of.  The dialogue is terrible (except the passages copied out from Jane Austen), and what is up with the use of the word \\"whilst\\"?  Grange uses it as though it is representative of the way they talked at that period; yet I found it so awkward and excessive that I finally searched all of Jane Austen's texts at Pemberley.com and found it used only four times, and that in Pride & Prejudice.  But beyond that admittedly focused complaint, the language really was terrible and awkward.  Can you imagine Mr. Knightley saying that Emma is the only woman for him?  Well you don't need to imagine it, he says it twice.  Don't ask how many times he laments \\"my Emma\\".    I think most disturbing to me, however, was the fact that Mr. Knightley referred over and over to Emma as a girl, and also to Harriet as Emma's \\"little\\" friend.  Given the age difference between Mr. Knightley and Emma, it is unseemly for him to think of her that way.  One would hope that Mr. Knightley is in love with a woman, not a girl.  This book was really unsatisfactory on every level; it didn't even feel like I was taking a turn with the original characters again.

0812971825|3.0|I didn't really like Strout's first novel, Amy and Isabelle, so I'm not sure why I decided to pursue this one. For me it wasn't a good choice.    Briefly, the story focuses on the Reverend Tyler Caskey, who leads a small church in a small New England town in the 1950s. Reverend Caskey is struggling-with just about everything. His unpopular and probably bipolar wife is dead of cancer, his mother is pressuring him to remarry. He is unnaturally fond of his odd housekeeper, who has secrets of her own, and his five year old daughter is raising eyebrows everywhere she goes. Caskey is also somewhat obsessed with theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, which I found ultimately distracting.    Certainly Strout can turn a phrase, and there is some elegance in her portrayal of ordinary people in simple circumstance. But at the end of the day-and those days seem to stretch endlessly at times-I just found the story dull. I did not care much about these people and their monotonous lives. I did not look forward to returning to their small, intimate town on my lunch breaks or at bedtime. It took me over a week to read a book of less than 300 pages. Abide with them, I simply prefer not to.
0316017922|5.0|In my opinion, Gladwell has done a magnificent job with this book, and the ideas presented are enormously important for anyone interested in success in just about any field of endeavor.<br /><br />His basic thesis is as follows:<br /><br />1. Inborn ability matters relatively little in many fields.  In some fields like science it matters more, but only in the sense that one needs a minimum threshold of ability (eg, IQ of at least 120); above that threshold, extra ability doesn't matter much.  [In predominantly creative fields like the compositional arts (as opposed to \\"mere\\" artistic performance like playing music composed by someone else), I suspect that inborn creative ability matters a lot, but standard measures like IQ may not reflect that ability.]<br /><br />2. In pretty much all fields, focused hard work is necessary to develop expertise, and generally about 10,000 hours need to be invested to reach the expert level.  But being an expert isn't the same as achieving the standout success of an \\"outlier\\" (eg, Bill Gates, Will Smith, or Barack Obama).<br /><br />3. Luck plays a large role in success.  Bad luck can dramatically inhibit success, and good luck fosters success.  Exceptionally good luck (eg, a long series of lucky circumstances) is needed to achieve success at the outlier level.  Luck clearly interacts with the first two factors noted above -- inborn ability involves rolling the genetic dice, and having the opportunity to put in one's 10,000 hours also involves luck (eg, poor kids aren't likely to have access to computer centers, violin lessons, and professional coaches).  Being immersed in a culture which fosters success in a particular field is also a matter of luck, along with being born at the \\"right\\" time within that culture.  But of course \\"luck\\" doesn't have to be entirely random, since it can be influenced by deliberately changing one's circumstances, exposures, networks, etc. (\\"Chance favors the prepared mind\\" - Pasteur); for example, if you live in Idaho and want to get into the music business, consider relocating to a more \\"happening\\" locale.<br /><br />The particular strength of Gladwell's book is that he's a great writer with outlier-level ability for storytelling.  Some reviewers have criticized his book for lack of originality, but Gladwell deserves credit and success for bringing these important ideas to a large general audience in a gripping and compelling way.  And he certainly doesn't claim that he came up with these ideas all by himself.<br /><br />Some reviewers have also criticized Gladwell for not adequately grounding his ideas in published research and for thereby cherry-picking data and arguing with straw men.  That's a somewhat odd criticism, since it contradicts the criticism of lack of originality.  Moreover, there are several good books available which describe the research critics might be looking for, such as the following:<br /><br />- [[ASIN:1591842247 Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else]] by Geoff Colvin is an excellent book which overlaps considerably with Gladwell's book.  The main difference is that Colvin puts greater emphasis on hard work (\\"deliberate practice\\") whereas Gladwell emphasizes luck more, so one could say that Colvin is more focused on expertise whereas Gladwell is more focused on going beyond expertise to the outlier level.<br /><br />- [[ASIN:052154369X Creativity in Science: Chance, Logic, Genius, and Zeitgeist]] by Dean Keith Simonton is another excellent book which focuses specifically on creativity (and success) within science.  The book reads like a PhD thesis and is quite rigorous in its use of careful reasoning, empirical data, and quantitative analysis.  In a sophisticated way, Simonton provides strong support for Gladwell's ideas, and he ultimately argues that chance (luck) is the dominant factor in scientific creativity and success, while also recognizing the supporting roles of genius (inborn ability), zeitgeist (culture), and logic (basic knowledge of one's scientific domain and its rules of inference, which comes from hard work, perhaps again involving roughly 10,000 hours invested in education and training).  Simonton also emphasizes that a scientist's chance of coming up with important results is directly related to total output (eg, number of papers published), so that ties chance to continued hard work after already becoming an expert (eg, obtaining a PhD).<br /><br />- [[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]] by Nassim Nicholas Taleb is a fascinating and provocative book which, coming from a different angle, also argues for the role of unforseeable luck (positive \\"black swans\\") in producing outlier-level success, with negative black swans having the opposite effect.<br /><br />In summary, I believe Gladwell has a done a great service in presenting very important ideas related to success in a user-friendly way, and I think the evidence (in his book and beyond) provides strong support for his ideas.<br /><br />Very highly recommended -- indeed, a must read, especially for parents.ntific domain and its rules of inference, which comes from hard work, perhaps again involving roughly 10,000 hours invested in education and training).

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  Probably not much, but I'll say it all anyways.  This is a fantastic movie.  There are lots of movies that top box office records and get tons of hype and media attention; they come and they go, I buy them on DVD and eventually they just blend into my collection to be watched only occasionally.  This is not one of those movies.  This, among only a handful of others that I can think of, I can watch and then a day or two later, I already get the craving to watch it again.  It just may be my favorite movie of all time.    Where do I begin my justification for this opinion?  I'll start with the plot:  it's complex, it's concise and it's amazing.  The movie feels almost more like a crime drama than it does a super hero flick, and it's much more entertaining as a crime drama than most crime dramas I've seen.  The fact that the main protagonist wears a bat costume is what reminds you that you're watching a Batman movie.  Batman and his allies (mainly Harvey Dent and Gordon) are just trying to take down the mob.   And I think this reason is why I was so quickly engrossed by the movie.  I don't really have to suspend much belief to be wrapped up in it.  Batman Begins has a great plot as well, but Ra's Al Ghul's goal was pretty ridiculous and in the end, it still felt like a Batman movie, even if it was the best until now.      The acting here is terrific.  I wasn't too fond of Maggie Gyllenhaal's performance here; her take on the Rachel character wasn't too believable to me, even though I do like her as an actress.  And Christian Bale himself, one of my favorite actors, didn't really get a whole lot of screen time as Bruce Wayne, but that's due to the fact that the movie is packed with characters.  But Gary Oldman is great, even though this role is incredibly tame for his skills, Morgan Freeman is Morgan Freeman and can't be argued against, and Aaron Eckhart is awesome here and I'm now a fan of his.      Now enter the Joker:  the film's dark and wonderfully twisted centerpiece.  Remember all of those other actors that I mentioned?  I don't either after watching Ledger play this role.  This is by far the most demented, sadistic and amazing take on The Joker that has ever been done in the Batman universe.  I applaud Nolan, Ledger and whoever else was a creative force behind this character.  The Joker is the best movie character I have ever seen and I am not exaggerating that point.  If you infused the unrelentingly merciless villain Anton Chygur from No Country for Old Men with a very disturbing sense of humor and a bit of psychotic schizophrenia, you might have an idea of what this rendition of the Joker is like.  Jack Nickelson's Joker, while iconic in his own way, doesn't even come to mind when drawing comparisons to Ledger's.  Nickelson's villain in the Departed is a closer comparison than his Joker.        The way The Joker character is written into the movie is also genius.  Rather than give him a back story and explain who he is, Nolan chose to have him simply appear, explaining that The Joker doesn't need an explanation, he just arrives.  It does, in a vague way, explain his rise to power as he starts with ripping off the mob and eventually getting them in his pocket.  I love the fact that at the very beginning of the movie, The Joker is considered small time and unimportant and the main story focuses on the mob.  One scene at a time, he changes everything, working each side to his own whim.      As if I haven't raved about The Joker enough, the best part about his character are his bizarre ticks and his incredible dialogue.  Almost everything he says in the movie is quotable and even stuff he doesn't say is up for imitation.  The way he messes with his tongue as he speaks (I assume Ledger worked that in as a habit the character would have developed after getting his mouth scars), the way he gives a different story every time he explains how he got his scars, the facial expressions he makes, all of these things together to make him a truly amazing character to watch (and in my case at least) become border-line obsessed with.      I don't have any real problems with the movie, and although I absolutely love it, nothing is perfect.  For me, it does lose a little bit of it's momentum toward the end and that's not for lack of action.  The tone of the movie changes a little bit in the last action sequence, and that could just be because the film is reaching a conclusion and can't quite end on the same note as the rest of the movie, but it just doesn't quite feel right.  The Joker's final plot and Batman trying to stop him is just a little hokey to me, though still not nearly as campy as a traditional Batman flick.  My only other complaint, and I appologize if I'm spoiling anything here, is the resolution with Harvey Dent's character.  We all know he becomes Twoface, but I thought his transformation into that character would've been better saved for the end as a hint toward the next film, or perhaps earlier in the film so we could've seen more of him.  He is one of Batman's trademark villains, but as far as the plot is written, he's pretty much served his purpose and it sounds like he's not coming back.  To me, this is kind of dissapointing, but at least we still got to see him.    There may be little purpose to this review as I'm sure 90% of its readers have already seen the film, but I felt compelled to write it anyways.  So watch The Dark Knight for the story, watch it for The Joker, or just watch it because you like Batman, but watch and enjoy this movie.  For once, there is a reason for the hype.
B000000WA4|4.0|This was the Pumpkins last (only truly 2nd) masterwork, even though it is bloated up by tons of indulgences, and perhaps one of the last great first-gen (only gen as far as I am concerned) alternative releases before the sub-standard waves of mediocrity swelled inland, even corroding this band to its core.

B001GQACGE|1.0|When a star assumes a different persona, the promise is always great and the results are always a mixed bag.  For every McCartney-Is-The-Fireman success, there are numerous Garth-Brooks-is-Chris-Gaines failures.  This CD by the otherwise clever Beyonce soundly belongs in the latter category.<br /><br />Make no mistake, Beyonce is a wildly talented singer.  However, like Brooks' endeavor, Beyonce's schizophrenia neither frees nor enhances the artist.  Instead, it tries hard to come as clever and original; retreads and unintentional remixes like 'Radio' and 'Diva' only succeed at marginalizing a terrific catalogue.<br /><br />She is...

B0001LYH9S|5.0|With most concept albums about the future the music and lyrics turn either into constipated mush or unfocused fodder.  This one, however, hits the mark like no other has.  I'm a huge Bowie fan, but when I was younger I didn't listen to music much until I discovered industrial music, and when I got into Bowie this album was an incredible surprise, and delight.  But first of all, for all you folks calling this a NIN rip-off, SHUT UP, it's called industrial music, not NIN music, so grow up and learn a thing or two about music before spouting.<br /><br />Like other futuristic albums I know, Billy Idol's 'Cyberpunk' was like I said before, unfocused; there's no real story and the music itself doesn't sound very futuristic, but rather now it sounds like out-dated early 90's electronica/punk.  Gary Numan's brilliant 'Replicas', which I absolutely love, tends to feel to me a bit constipated; all the songs fit the concept, but there is no underlying story (that you hear) so the album tends not to go to far from track 1.<br /><br />This album, however, comes with a short story written by Bowie, so if you get confused in the often confusing lyrics you actually get a (brilliantly written) background.  Bowie's writing style is honestly like almost nothing I've experienced before, but I would say it seem pretty W. S. Burroughs-esque.<br /><br />The music ranges from progressive rock to shoe-gazer, from heavy electronica to heavier industrial menace.  the range in music is what really brings in the concept.  It isn't one techo-laden rock song after another, absolutely not at all.<br /><br />The more rock-oriented tracks (Outside, Strangers When We Meet, The Voyeur of utter destruction, and Thru' These Architect's Eyes) are the few tracks that don't clearly dive between genres, and are nice liberators from the electronic production of most tracks.<br /><br />The industiral-tinged pieces (Heart's Filthy Lesson, Hallo Spaceboy, I have not been to oxford town, I am with name, and wishful beginnings) may remind people of NIN, but I honestly don't hear it, because I know industrial music and these pieces sound more like something that, say, David Bowie would do.  He's an honestly original musician, and these songs prove it.  Wishful beginnings is a deeply gothic track, I have not... houses some interesting trip hop percussion, no two tracks sound the same at all.  The interesting thing about the song 'I am with name' is that the music was used very heavily during the entire Outside recording sessions.  Many songs actually derive from similar music, especially the percussion.<br /><br />The Motel, A Small Plot of Land and the segues are deep compositions with smart instrumentation.  I feel there's a little of Buddha of Suburbia's jazz influence still in these songs.  The Motel is an incredible and disturbingly dark ballad, and the segues' voice-overs (all done by Bowie) fit in perfectly in the scheme.<br /><br />I think people have the most problem with the electronica-tinged pieces (No control, We Prick you, and I'm deranged) but these just show Bowie's strong diversity with genres and instrumentation.  These serve as strong precursors to Earthling (an album that tried a little too hard to be one thing, and could've done well with more variety like Outside).<br /><br />So enough 'Bowie's a rip-off artist'.  This album is a true testament to Bowie's genius, and since I first purchased it it's been a frequent inhabitant of my player.

I feel there's a little of Buddha of Suburbia's jazz influence still in these songs.  The Motel is an incredible and disturbingly dark ballad, and the segues' voice-overs (all done by Bowie) fit in perfectly in the scheme.<br /><br />I think people have the most problem with the electronica-tinged pieces (No control, We Prick you, and I'm deranged) but these just show Bowie's strong diversity with genres and instrumentation.  These serve as strong precursors to Earthling (an album that tried a little too hard to be one thing, and could've done well with more variety like Outside).<br /><br />So enough 'Bowie's a rip-off artist'.  This album is a true testament to Bowie's genius, and since I first purchased it it's been a frequent inhabitant of my player.  I think I may need to purchase a new copy soon.<br /><br />And if you can find a copy of the unreleased songs from Outside do so, they're worth it.
B001GCUNVW|5.0|Aronofsky has it down perfectly. He portrays the indie wrestling scene and the character of Randy 'The Ram' perfectly. This movie is almost like watching a documentary about Randy 'The Ram'. This adds to the movie and makes it unbelievably realistic. Same goes for the strippers and strip joint and the average life that he lives. This is a good movie and Mickey Rourke is a GREAT actor. I enjoyed every minute of it though this can be a very sad movie.<br /><br />Even if you are not a pro wrestling fan you will love this movie cause that is not really what it is about. It is about people.
B000002U9E|5.0|Just a quick review, I won't go track-by-track cause it isn't necessary.  Simply put, this is a must-own CD for anyone who likes female vocalists or intelligent, well-written music.  Don't even bother thinking about it.  Since you're curious and reading this review, you need to just buy it.  It's also a perfect initiation into Kate Bush.    Some have said that Kate's latest 2-disc work 'Aerial' is her masterwork, and I can see their persepective on that.  Aerial is certainly breathtaking and truly artistic, and I love it.  But: I'm not always in the mood to HEAR it.  Aerial doesn't have the same universal appeal and overall listenability as Hounds of Love, so I still have to put Hounds of Love on top.    The only thing that may throw off some listeners is the use of synthesizers on many tracks.  _I_ don't mind, I love the 80's and I can accept synthesizers if the overall writing is brilliant, as it truly is here.  However, I just had a thought while listening which motivated me to come write this review.  If Kate redid Hounds of Love with a full orchestra, I would just about die of happiness.  Done perfectly, that would rank 6 out of 5 stars.  This one is still 5 out of 5.
1416595546|5.0|Though I greatly like historical novels in principle, they can be irritating in practice. In an effort to ease the intellectual strain on readers, writers too often smooth off the jagged edges of the past. The characters may differ from us in names, costumes and household gadgets, but they share a 21st Century mentalité.    Simon Montefiore's \\"Sashenka\\" is free from any such fault. In three episodes, it highlights the separation between ourselves and the worlds of Russia in 1916, 1939 and 1994.    * St. Petersburg on the eve of revolution is nervous and frenetic. Sixteen-year-old Baroness Alexandra Samuilovna Zeitlin is the pampered only child of nouveaux riches Jews who hobnob with the lofty and corrupt denizens of the Imperial Court. She is also, in secret, the ardent disciple of her Bolshevik uncle, actively at work in the revolutionary underground, and immersed in intrigues that will help overturn the Russian Empire while having distant, unforeseeable repercussions in her own life.    * Moscow in 1939 lives in a state of fear and falsehood. Sashenka, now a wife, mother and loyal Party propagandist, is honored with the favorable notice of the voivode himself - and learns how dangerous it can be for the little mice to be noticed by the omnipotent lion.    * Finally, in post-communist Russia, a researcher hired by one of the new breed of nouveaux riches \\"oligarchs\\" stumbles across Sashenka's story and unravels her fate through a series of seriocomic encounters with the keepers of the Soviet Union's written and unwritten memories.    The novel's strength lies in its depiction of these three milieux. Plot and characters are of secondary importance. Coincidence plays a major role, albeit no greater than fits times full of arbitrary and capricious events. The characters, too, tend to be types rather than fully formed individuals, but their relative flatness (by which I don't mean to imply that their sketched-in traits are not fascinating) renders the landscape more three dimensional.    Russia's tragic 20th Century has already drawn the attention of literary giants: Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak, Grossman et al. Simon Montefiore may fall short of that company, but there is ample space for his illuminating and entertaining work.
0316017922|4.0|I enjoyed the first half of this book more than the second half. Much of the book covers material that is pertinent to parents raising young children.
B000J10ERO|1.0|Honestly, I am a man of steel fan. I loved Superman I & II and even own the Richard Donner Cut of II. However, this is a disgrace to the man of steel. How dare they make Superman a dad, let along a dead-beat dad. It also brings to mind one of the worst lines in movie history, \\"I forgotten how warm you are.\\" Everyone in the theater laughed at that. What, is Lois Lane in a competition with Anakin Skywalker at who can be the sappiest? Gag.  As for the plot, eerily seems like Superman: The Movie's plot only instead of knocking California into the ocean They end up building land in the ocean. Same freakin' difference.   This movie is an embarrassment. Don't watch it. Watch Superman I & II and like all other Supes sequels just pretend this abomination didn't happen. If there were a way to give negative stars I will. I hated this movie so much I went back to smoking. Thanks.
0743270754|1.0|The book looks at three rivals who sort of worked together in the end. The book fails to address Lincolns disasterous decisions with the rest of his cabinet and the generals he selected.  The cost of the war in terms of money and humanity due to his inability to select a proper set of generals while trying to appease everyone made the war last about 3 years longer than it ever had to considering all the advantages the north had.  If Linconls philosophy was to have a team of rivals it nearly destroyed the nation.   Here's hoping Obama actually rereads his history and doesn't take too much away from this book he claims to love without knowing....the rest of the story.
B00004TRD8|5.0|This is probably the best dvd I own as far picture and sound quality, the features are great which I have heard have been cut on the Blu-Ray. That's a travesty, considering how awesome this movie is!! When I got my Blu-ray I wanted to test it with this movie, unfortuanately from what I understand I'd be better off sticking with this version. I don't mind waiting until a comparable version comes out on Blu-ray.
0316143472|5.0|Before writing this review, I read a smattering of other reviews, particularly the one star reviews.  Yowza! I didn't realize there are that many people out there that expect so much from a book.  Next, they will want Sedaris to rotate their tires and patch their jeans.<br /><br />I found the book to be highly entertaining.  Yes, it is a small departure from previous works by the author but for me it shows growth, not regression.  As we stumble toward the cemetery we do tend to get more introspective - that's just the way it's designed.  I for one, appreciate this new version.<br /><br />Concerning the humor in the book.  I have only one word.  Funny.  For those who are homophobic, I have two.  Scary and Funny.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.<br /><br />Michael L.

B0002858YS|5.0|Everyone has heard the single mr. brightside. But the rest of the album is just all the way groundbreaking.  In the days of heavy metal and emo/screamo, these guys bring their own sound and style. This album is in my top 100 of all time.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger games is a great book.  I read it over the weekend and couldnt put the book down.
0316010669|5.0|The people who reviewed this book poorly may not have to deal with race issues. Even though I'm Navajo, Gladwell makes some astute humanitarian and race observations that have whirled around in my head for years. He makes affirmations about my theories of race and our denials of our repressed feelings. I did the test of associating good with African American image, and I even struggled with it. I liked Gladwell's honest approach.<br /><br />He also exhibits a great writing style. Though I read Blink several weeks ago, I'm still talking about it. My gushing comments inspired friends to buy the book for friends, spouses, and even themselves. Get this, I broked away from my gym workout to discuss Blink with a friend. Since I take my gym seriously, this is an all time new one. I've lent my copy out, and when I get it back, I want to explore the researchers of classifying facial expressions. In the meantime, I'll get Tipping Point.<br /><br />Thank you, Malcolm, for your work. It's great to find an author who sees the world as I do. We must find avenues to get along without the superficial talk and denial. I'll write again if I mimic my reaction at the gym after reading Tipping Point.
B001F290E4|5.0|I picked this CD based on the song selection even more than it being Seal.  I love all these songs to begin with and Seal's style and voice just bring them to life.  I don't know that I've ever given a 5-star rating before, but this one deserves it.    I bought one for a friend in his 20's and one in his 40's and both of them love it, so that says a lot about the music and the performance.  I know I'll give it again as a gift and I will recommend it to friends.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Batman Tim Burton version, 1989, good classic comic series.  Excellent Batman performance by Michael Keaton, and a good performance by Jack Nicholson as the Joker, and years and years and years later, making more and more Batman movies, and along the way, evolving more and more.  And now, it has evolved into the deep, dark underpinnings of THE DARK KNIGHT.  They have taken the classic comic film by Tim Burton, and turned it into the most intense, not just Batman movie, but standard movie.  The most intense blockbuster in the history of movies.  If Heath Ledger wins the best supporting actor oscar, which I know for a fact that he will, I will pee my pants, no, I will poop my pants, no, well actually thats all.  Heath Ledger's performance in the Dark Knight is breathtaking.  It is so intense.  But it would never be as good as it would be if Heath Ledger wasn't the Joker.  He completes it.  What an outstanding way to finish your career.  Its a good thing that Heath Ledger managed to give us one, Last performance before he left us.  We will miss you Heath Ledger, and tonight, you will be honored for your performance.  HEATH LEDGER FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR OF 2009.
B000002GB9|5.0|\\"The Grand Illusion\\" is probably Styx's best all around album.  Although they had already had quite a bit of success and become staples of the Midwest arena circuit, this would be the album that would catapult the band to multi-platinum superstar status.  The album produced two huge hits with \\"Come Sail Away\\" and \\"Fooling yourself\\" both of which can be regularly heard on classic rock radio today on a regular basis.  Several other tracks received album rock airplay as well.  The album contains all of the varied elements that made Styx what they were.  You have Pomp Rock with \\"The Grand Illusion\\", and \\"Superstars\\", progressive rock with \\"Man In The Wilderness\\" and one of Dennis Deyoung's best compositions \\"Castle Walls\\", and Hard Rock / Metal with the James Young staple \\"Miss America\\".  Sure there is an air of pretension about the whole thing, but hey this was the 70's.  All in all this is one of Styx best albums and a must own for fans of the band.
B00006IRJU|4.0|This was Icehouses high point in terms of popularity, but for long time fans, this album \\"did a job\\" for the band, it was designed to crack the US market with an AOR middle of the road vibe and hell, it delivered. It is a safe par 5, it lays up short of the water and takes a wedge and 2 putts, it is the opening batsman scoring 50 in 40 overs. But, despite this, and because of Iva Davies musical values, it is done very well, and there are some strong tracks on this, especially Man of Colours, which still sends a shiver down my spine 20 years on, it is a tender evocation of an artist at work. Other tracks like Sunrise, I feel try a little too hard. Overall a strong album and one that compares and contrasts nicely with their later and earlier work.
B001DJXX6U|5.0|I've been a great Pink Floyd fan for a long time. This concert is almost a Pink Floyd Concert. David Gilmour, Richard Wright, Guy Pratt, Dick Perry, they're all there! Nick Mason isn't a irreplaceable drummer like Keith Moon or John Bonham, and so is Roger Waters (the last one being a major loss in compositions, though). So, if you're a PF fan, you can't miss this. Just the new acoustic arrangement of Shine On You Crazy Diamond should make this worthy. And the packaging is great, making this a nice collectable item.
B0000A1HQP|5.0|If you enjoy French comedies, as I do, and if you enjoyed The Valet and The Closet, also written and directed by Francis Veber, you will surely enjoy this clever and well crafted comedy.<br /><br />Pierre Brochant, an upper middle class French publisher, participates in a weekly dinner party with several of his buddies in which they each invite an, unknowing, idiot to dinner for their amusement. It's not unlike the \\"Ugly Girl\\" contest they enjoyed in college.<br /><br />Brochant invites François Pignon (a character that also appears in other Veber comedies), a model builder that makes models of engineering structures like the Eiffel Tower and the Golden Gate Bridge out of matchsticks, as his dinner guest.<br /><br />Prior to dinner, Brochant asks Pignon to his elegant Paris apartment to get to know him better before displaying him at the \\"idiots' dinner\\". Unfortunately, Pignon arrives just as Brochant's wife walks out on him. Having had a similar experience, Pignon can empathize and sincerely tries to help his new friend.<br /><br />Being the idiot that he is, Pignon continues to make matters worse for Brochant by his continuous and hilarious bungling. Pignon proves that he truly is an idiot although always sincere and well intentioned.<br /><br />Along the way Pignon learns the true reason he was invited to dinner and is deeply hurt. Despite his humiliation and anger, Pignon is able to rise to the occasion and help is non-friend by convincing Brochant's wife on the phone to return to her husband. For that moment, Pignon is the smart one and Brochant realizes that he is the real idiot. But, will Pignon blow it; watch and find out.<br /><br />The Dinner Game is really an enjoyable movie and well worth seeing. I highly recommend it.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I walked throughout my first pregnancy but was too sick at the beginning this time around, so I started at 20 weeks quite out of shape.  I was surprised at how much Erin gets my heart rate up just from doing lunges, squats, etc.  I feel like every exercise is really doing something to prepare me for labor and delivery, and I'll be using it even when I'm not pregnant to keep toned.  I've tried other pregnancy workouts like 10 minute Prenatal Pilates and Denise Austin's Fit and Firm Pregnancy, and the others have been super modified so that my non-pregnant exercise buddies get no workout.  I love that the moves Erin does are simple but work me hard enough that I'm still working up to doing all of the reps.    I can do this workout in my bedroom or living room with no props, and my two year old even likes doing it with me!
B001CJJWV6|4.0|Great sound quality and great performance. Probably Jimi's best performance ever.    I've read the other reviews and understand that the picture quality is not perfect because the performace is over 40 years old and was shot in 4:3 (1.33) and not widescreen. But then what is the advantage of paying for the Blu-ray then ? I'll bet the DVD picture is just as good.    Even so, I gave it 4 stars because of sound quality. And also since the Blu-ray is only a few dollars more than the DVD, go ahead and get the Blu-ray. Just don't set your expectations too high for picture quality.    The extras were good as well. Interviews with the people that set it all up.    \\"Didn't even rain...no buttons to push...\\"
B000V6I7WG|5.0|Oldboy is one of my favorite films.     Let me get that out of the way to show my bias. I love Oldboy. I think it's brilliant, I think the story is fantastic, I think the cinematography is phenomenal, and the acting is amazing. I can go on, but alas, I've run out of adjectives.     This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to get just a piece of the puzzle throughout the movie until the shocking (and it is extremely shocking) ending. You will find the grand reveal disturbing. There is no way around that. Once you get past the initial shock though, you will find yourself asking new questions about true love. The action is great but, contrary to what some reviews you may read have said, shockingly restrained (at least in comparison to other Asian films along the same genres (J-Horror for example)). Most of the most brutal parts are psychological or implied (the root canal scene comes to mind). As for the controversial octopus scene, eating an octopus while still alive isn't completely unheard of in Japan. It's just a cultural difference really. If it's any consolation, Min-sik Choi (who plays the main character) is a devout Buddhist who said a prayer for the octopi before every take. If you enjoy action or appreciate cinematography, this film is a must buy simply based upon the hallway fight scene.     All in all, whether you like Asian cinema or not, if you have a desire for a dark dramatic action movie and possess a strong stomach, you need to see Oldboy. You will be happy you did.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|A real treat here is the music was performed by Benny Andersson and many of the musicians from the original Abba recordings.  We also get new arrangements of the songs, plus a different version with different lyrics of \\"When All Is Said and Done\\".  I'd have to think that the new lyrics are from Bjorn with the new arrangements either by Benny or both.  Given the level of control both keep over the Abba catalog, I can't imagine them allowing anyone else to change one of their best songs.    While the vocals can never match the original Abba, the new arangements make this a very enjoyable CD, as close to new \\"Abba\\" music as we will ever get. (However Benny Andersson's \\"Bao\\" releases still contain all those classic Abba melodies, just performed differently.)
0307269752|1.0|Although Mr Larrson is an accomplished journalist, the novel he wrote does not satisfy the criteria for mystery/fiction writing in that it never comes to an exciting climax.  He spends 1/2 of the book involved with his characters ad nauseum regarding their convoluted relationships. The other main character, introduced briefly at the story start does not fully enter the picture until same 1/2 way through the book.  Everythin is factual (as a journalist would write), and the ending was no surprise.  Sorry I wasted my money on this one.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is perhaps the finest recent historical series, following in the grand tradition of some of TV's earliest efforts. The acting is superb, the direction and scene setting authentic; in all, an example of what film and TV can do when it tries.     The TV series led me to buy the audio version to listen to on long drives; both versions will provide viewing/listening for years to come. We have much to learn from the efforts of our earliest leaders. Some of our current Washington figures should watch this series to learn what service to country and family really mean.
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|I didn't know Meryl Streep and Pierce Bronson could sing!  That was a nice surprise.<br /><br />This was a really fun musical with some very zany, unique and creative dances and scenes and plots.  I LOVED the scene of a bunch of guys doing a dance on the dock with flippers.  I laughed many times during this musical and it was such a joyous experience watching it for the first time.  It was also fun to hear the old ABBA songs I haven't heard for years, and loved so much as a kid.<br /><br />For a musical tho, I was surprised that they didn't cast singers with stronger vocals.  They were passable for sure, but the vocals weren't excellent, which you usually do find in musicals.  But, that also may have added to the quirkiness of this musical.
0765348276|5.0|I'd like to add my own 5 stars to this amazing series that started in Old Man's War. I have to say I didn't expect the story to work it's magic on me the way it had. I thought it would be like the space operas of Peter F. Hamilton (who, btw, also writes great space operas and is one of my long favorites). I was wrong. It was profoundly more human - the plot is truly driven by the characters. While the writing style is relaxed and flows easily and beautifully. I read each of the books in only short periods of time, neither getting confused nor getting tired (because I didn't need to access the deepest branches of my BrainPal often). Yet despite that, the books provided a rich experience. The twists and plots were not convoluted as to lose the reader, but are nonetheless as exciting and surprising. The characters come alive with their own philosophical dilemmas not far from what we might experience.<br /><br />I'll definitely miss John Perry and Jane Sagan, but I'll look forward to reading more about Zoe in the upcoming \\"Zoe's Tale\\".<br /><br />This is a great series, and John Scalzi is a great writer. They come highly recommended.

B000002UA0|4.0|In this album Pink fFloyd broke down some of the barriers of music. The album is so very different than probably anything you've heard before. They weren't afraid to take chances and use instraments to create sounds unlike anything that had been heard before. Under the guidance of Syd Barret, this album gives you a glimpse into the mind of someone with a very different mind than most. songs like flaming and bike give a sort of playful yet insane feeling. But the bottom line is if you've never heard this album before it won't be anything like what you expected to hear. almost nothing like the Pink floyd we know now. but that's not a bad thing.
B00006IUL7|1.0|Insomnia starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams is pretty boring for a Christopher Nolan film, this is the second film after the brilliant psychological thriller Memento. Insomnia just drags and drags with every minute that passes, even with two famous actors you can't take this film seriously. Hilary Swank is pretty much under-used here, I hated everything about this film. Don't watch this train wreck!
B0013FSL3E|2.0|SPOILERS!!!    Well, it's certainly a nice film, upbeat with a happy ending and a simple resolution to an insoluble set of problems. Basically, it's a three-segment TV show, the first segment (Wall-E and Eve) being the best; the second and third introducing the space ship Axiom, its captain, passengers, and robots, and then resolving a conflict between the Captain and his evil robot auto-pilot about returning to Earth for the happy ending. The three segments are loosely linked together by the quasi-romance between Wall-E and Eve set up in the first segment, but there is a real conflict within the film itself between two faces of the story: Wall-E and Eve on a nearly destroyed Earth, and the cartoony battle between the Captain and the minions of the evil auto-pilot.    It's easy to be critical about the second and third segments. They're cartoony to the max, they lack character development of any kind for the Captain and the Auto-Pilot, they resolve into the happy ending without any explanations. For example, how come the Captain can transform from an ignorant fat slob to the hero who leads his ship back to Earth? Unlike the subtle and nuanced portrayal of Wall-E and Eve, neither the Captain or the Auto-Pilot have any reasons for what they do. Auto-Pilot is merely evil -- but why should an autopilot program behave like that? -- and is destroyed far too easily for a machine that can operate the entire ship. These flaws are not repaired by frequent references to recent U.S. politics -- the president of the BNL Corporation sounds exactly like George W. Bush; the \\"Green\\" theme is hand-wavingly clichéd; the use of commercial themes like the power-up chord of the Mac computer is too local to have any meaning for an isolated world on a spaceship 700 years in the future. In segments two and three, the film makes a wrenching downshift to U.S. television animation, for example, in its much too easy parody of obese Americans lounging in beach chairs.    Also notable is the shift in animation technique and meaning between the first segment and the second two. The first is done in ultra-realist animation, in sepia, tans, and browns, with skillful and sometimes strikingly surreal images of huge monuments of compressed trash. Wall-E collects odd remnants of human history, and I was hoping -- vainly, as it turned out -- for a resolution/explanation of his preservation of toys, dolls, a beautifully-rendered Zippo lighter (it still has lighter fluid after 700 years -- a wonderful touch!), and almost poignant clips from old musicals and operettas. But instead of taking Wall-E and Eve on a journey to find what these things mean and to discover why Wall-E collects and treasures them, the film wrenches into the cartoony fat slob Captain -- and we lose all the previous and careful cinematic presentation of a world that seems doomed to die. So there can be no real epiphany of rebirth at the end, because the film-makers abandoned that world for the cartoony fat slob captain.    In parallel, the first segment has some impossibilities -- though I'm tempted to call them \\"mistakes,\\" both factual and cinematic. One is that the world portrayed is not 700 years in the future. The future world of \\"Wall-E\\" is shown as having at least one seedling and having rain (for example, there's a thunderstorm) -- and in biological reality the world and its garbage-compactor cities of cubes of trash therefore would be an overwhelming mass of greenery (that seedling came from a seed; seeds come from mature trees; there would accordingly be plants everywhere). So we mentally change both the time frame and botanical reality to accept the plausibility the vision we are shown of a world depopulated of humans and inhabited only by cockroaches and robots. Into that world comes Eve -- and we want to know how they will resolve the story. Obviously, fat slob captains are not the answer.    So \\"Wall-E\\" is one-third of a fine -- very good indeed -- setting for a cinematographic storythat is not resolved and never reaches the epiphany it deserves. And so we, the viewers, are left at the end smiling and chuckling at the wittiness (?) of animating fat cartoony captains, and are deprived of what could have been a genuinely first-class animated film.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|Requiem for a Dream soundtrack is just as good as the movie. This soundtrack is haunting and gorgeous to the bone. The music is created by Clint Mansell, he is truly talented in every way. The string quartet he uses is the best I have ever heard, even the electronic tracks will catch your attention as well. The Winter Overture is probably the best, I love this soundtrack period. Buy it today and see the film too. Enjoy!
B00122V0IG|4.0|I started picking up tracks as downloads for points earned under the Pepsi Free promotion. It was a good choice given you could pick up a full symphony with 4 downloads. But after using up points, I decided it was worth filling out with purchased tracks. At less than $4 a symphony, it is a great value. But it is also a good recording, in particular because it was an enjoyable contrast to my standby digital recording of Beethoven's symphonies by von Karajan (not as good as his '63 recording, but the first full digital contribution from DG). These recordings are decidedly lighter and more spritely than the more forceful von Karajan recordings, and yet perhaps suggest an interpretation that is more akin to LvB's contemporaries. Certainly worth the price.
0060558121|5.0|AMERICAN GODS is a refreshing treat amidst current Urban Fantasy fiction. I'm sorry I did not have the chance to read this book when it was first published. It's a beautiful blend of myth, wonderful prose and original characters. Gaiman is masterful and holds the reader spellbound from beginning to end.
0739474812|5.0|For those of you who remember \\"Gothic Romances\\" this is a refreshing visit back in time, however, this tale seems to avoid the few things about the Gothics that used to bug me (i.e. that all the heroines were pitifully weak, even the ones that were described as \\"full of fire!\\" and basically too stupid to live.)  The heroine of this story is intelligent and strong and sensible, entirely likeable, and, while there is romantic interest, she does not need a male to rescue her by the end of the story.  You find yourself coming to truly care about all of the characters in the book - I found myself waking up in the middle of the night and going back out to the living room to read more, because I wanted to know what happened to the characters.  It's been a long time since I read a book that did that to me!  I'm buying my own copy now (I had originally borrowed it from the library) so that I can lend it out - and I will be checking out more of Diane Setterfield's books to find out if her work is consistently as excellent as this was.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is by far the Best DVD I own. Excellent and Amazing video footage, Music and Commentary. Highly recommended especially if you have Kids.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|If you are a fan of anything Joss then this is perfect - Fan service from the mind of the man that gave us some of the greatest shows ever.  Joss's songs sung by the inimitable N.P.H.!, Nathan Fillion, and the ever so cute Felicia Day..  This show is ridiculously silly.  The songs are perfect with the help of Joss borther and other family members.  Joss of course adds his darkside at the end which only makes you love and long for his characters even more...  Buy this now or Bad Horse the Thoroughbred of Sin will make you his mare!

0743290119|4.0|I've never written a review for a book before but I felt compelled to after reading some of the very harsh reviews on this book. Granted it is not a life changing book but I think the title, cover, and storyline adequately give that away. This was a very easy and entertaining read. Even though I don't have the same lifestyle as the main characters, I was able to relate to many of the issues that each one was dealing with. The story about Otis was a great addition! All in all I really enjoyed the book and read it in two days. A perfect book to curl up by the fire with.

0385340990|5.0|\\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a truly delightful book.  It is a work of fiction that incorporates very real events - the occupation of Guernsey and the other Channel islands during WWII.  An epistolary novel, the action unfolds through a series of letters between the main characters, and some minor characters who come to play an important role in the life of the main narrator, Juliet Ashton.<br /><br />Juliet Ashton, a single 30-something newspaper columnist, had made a name for herself during the war for her witting columns written under a pseudonym.  But now that the war is done, she wants to write a novel about the war, one that will perhaps not be too heartbreaking or grim.  Seemingly by chance, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams, a man who lives on Guernsey, asking where he can get more books about Charles Lamb.  Somehow Dawsey had come to possess a copy of Lamb's work with Juliet's name on the inside.  Juliet begins a correspondence with Dawsey, and soon discovers that a story for her novel might exist on Guernsey.  Leaving her London life behind, Juliet sets out on the trip of a lifetime.  While searching for material for her novel, and quickly being welcomed as a member of the island community, she finds herself and her future.<br /><br />Shaffer and Barrows have done a remarkable job at creating a fast-paced novel that incorporates some truly horrific and real events.  The title is also the name of a society formed on the island of Guernsey by its whimsical inhabitants during the long nights of curfew and deprivation during the occupation.  The authors are able to bring a wide cast of characters to life in letter form and make would could be a predictable ending truly enjoyable.  \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is easily one of my favorite books of the year and one I will recommend to everyone for a long time.

B001FB55MG|3.0|I usually don't like Adam Sandler movies that much. I think he's a very over-rated comedian. He just plays the same obnoxious, violent jerk in all his movies. I don't know why talented actors like Jack Nicholson have been drawn to work with him. Here, you have talented actors like Keri Russel, Guy Pearce, Courtney Cox and the hilarious Russel Brand.<br /><br />  Sandler's character isn't that much different from what he usually plays. He's a little bit obnoxious and a little less violent. But for once I actually found him likable. Russel Brand easily steals every scene he shares with Sandler though. He's basically playing the same guy he did in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but I rather see him have a long career of playing the same guy than Sandler. Guy Pearce though, I have no idea what made him do this movie. He's a very talented actor but he's just wasted here as the guy who's getting the job that Sandler's character wants. He's not very good in the movie either I admit. He really should stick to more serious roles. To see what I mean, check him out in Memento or Traitor and then watch him in this. Hell, he was even better in the Time Machine.<br /><br />  Another problem I had with it was that the guinea pig is over-used and not that funny. They just gave a guinea pig CGI big eyes and call him Bugsy, woo hoo. But hey, maybe kids will find that more funny than grown-ups.<br /><br />  The movie did keep my attention through-out though. I found it fun at times even. Sandler is decent in a movie that someone like Brendon Fraser would usually be in. It's a much better fantasy comedy for him than Click was as well. Plus, unlike with Click, there's no scene where he attempts to make us feel for his character by crying....thank god.
B000063Y8F|5.0|I use a great deal of crushed garlic in all my cooking. Most of the garlic presses I have owned required a great deal of pressure and were a pain to clean. The Rosle was a great find. It really makes it quite easy to press the garlic and the swing out device makes it a cinch to clean. This is really the best garlic press on the market and worth every penny.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Been using this for a couple of months now in my car. The unit as never had any trouble acquiring a signal and does so in a few seconds. Nothing bad to say about it in terms of performance (though I haven't had the heart to test its WaterProof feature yet!).    The only issue I seem to have is that Microsoft Streets and Trips 2009 sometime has trouble communicating with the device. This usually happens if I put my laptop into sleep mode without shutting off the GPS. A quick log off and log back on seems to fix the issue. For reference I'm using a Lenovo x61 Tablet with Windows Vista.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This movie is perfect. It is funny, heartwarming, dramatic, well acted, and well made.  It won't let you down at all.  If you have a heart, then \\"Babe\\" will capture it for a couple of hours.
B00005JOA0|3.0|Although I've never considered the book particularly dark,at times situations are bleak while character is being built and challenges overcome.  Here in the movie version of the tale,however,there seems to be a focus on all the dark challenges while minoring on the beautiful character outcomes that grow from making honorable choices.  Too bad.  The actors and sets are great.
0694003611|5.0|I received this book as a shower gift and thought it looked outdated.  I started reading it along with a few other books to my son when he was only two months old.  This was the only book he paid attention to.  The bright illustrations caught his attention and the words seemed to entertain him.  He's now a busy 11 month old and it is our go to book to calm him at bedtime.  I will buy a copy for every expectant mother I know along with \\"Peek a Who\\" - our other household favorite!
0446402389|1.0|Read this book as science fiction or fantasy (and poorly edited as that). As far as describing Russian people's relationships and society, the book is sheer nonsense. Every page is riddled with implausible situations. Just several examples:    A vet opens an office close to embassies and treats diplomats' pets. [Neither medical nor veterinary doctors could have private offices. They always worked for the state and thus couldn't decide to open anything or treat whoever they wanted]    The state approved of war-time rapes by Russian soldiers. [Though no doubt the rapes happened, the state prosecuted the offenders who were caught]    A man says [and a militia man believes him] that he carries a knife because his wife insists on buying only cheap hard salami. [The hard salami was the most expensive kind, the most coveted. Salami was harder to find than any other type of sausage]    A collective farm chairman supports aiding and abetting a criminal by his entire kolkhoz membership. At the same time, the criminal is wondering if this kolkhoz has any Communist and regime sympathizers. [To be a kolkhoz chairman, one had to be a Communist party member. ]    But the following example will surely impress English teachers and any person who studied English in school: \\"Entering the farmhouse, the boy's body was gone.\\" This is by Tom Rob Smith, a Cambridge University graduate no less.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I think the worst sin of this whole collection is that it was background music for the most part, with just enough moderately enjoyable tracks to keep you hoping it's not going to be a total waste of time.  But I assure you, it is.  Funny, that may be an appropriate description of the movie too...huh.<br /><br />\\"Full Moon\\" in particular was painfully boring and tracks 5 & 6 were too nondescript to describe, I'd rather listen to a fan whirring or a clock ticking.  The only redeeming quality of \\"Tremble for my Beloved\\" is the title.  1,3,5,6,7,9 all mindless: repetative bass lines, predictable melodies, irritating effects and childish drumbeats.<br /><br />The majority of these tracks would have good for a 10-15 second interlude or maybe a driving sequence but there's 20 minutes of offensively mindless \\"music.\\"<br /><br />But by far the biggest disappointment for me was Bella's Lullaby, I had expected a bit of a letdown because the odds of any composer plucking the music out of my head were fairly low, but this was not a lullaby at all.  Honestly I did not think it was even that lovely of a piece even apart from the misnomer. They should have scrapped the Bella's Lullaby concept and just called it \\"Twilight Love Theme\\" or something. And seriously, no Clair de Lune?  Did Debussy want too much $$?<br /><br />I must say, however, that Paramore is growing on me, they have an appropriately angsty-punkish (and generally upbeat) sound and lyrics that are less juvenile than you might assume.  They save the album from falling into nondescript pop-rock-techie monotony, although one track would have been enough.  Linkin Park's \\"Leave Out all the Rest\\" was a welcome break to the all-driving-energy-no-melody-or-intelligent-lyrics drivel.  But nothing surprising there, they've never let me down before. Of course it is impossible to have a Stephenie Meyer story without a shout-out to Muse; and \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" is also one of the few redeeming tracks.<br /><br />On a happier note, I was pleasantly surprised by Rob Pattison's \\"Never Think.\\"  Moody and folky, it is a nice contrast to the moody-punky Paramore and the moody-metally Linkin Park.  I'm looking forward to hearing more of his music.  Speaking of moody and folky, really the only outstanding track here was Iron & Wine's \\"Flightless Bird American Mouth\\" (but really is there anytime when Iron & Wine isn't appropriate?).  Wonderfully appropriate lyrics as well: \\"have I found you, flightless bird, jealous, weeping, or lost you.\\"  That's earns you a star, Twilight!<br /><br />But did I mention how disappointed I was in the \\"lullaby\\"?  Grrrr.ob Pattison's \\"Never Think.\\"  Moody and folky, it is a nice contrast to the moody-punky Paramore and the moody-metally Linkin Park.  I'm looking forward to hearing more of his music.

0312944926|1.0|Short version:   Avoid this book, it's garbage.    Long version:  Every female character is described in drawn out physical detail.  I know this is a Dan Brown trait, but in this book even the bit characters (including one who is only indirectly in the story) are getting this treatment.  It's less offensive than it is funny, makes it hard to take the story seriously.    If you know anything about computer hardware or programming you will be very annoyed with the lack of research.  Heck even if you are just reasonably familiar with your home PC you'll probably pick up on a lot of it.  It's simply glaring.    And worst of all; it's not clever.  Not even a little.  Action sequences are needlessly drawn out to artificially create suspense.  You'll figure out most of the \\"gotchas\\" immediately then be left waiting for the characters to catch up.  The worst of these is by far the ending.  The last several (5+ or so) chapters are devoted to a high pressure situation where the characters need to figure out some clue to save the NSA.  If you have even a passive knowledge of science you will probably figure out the answer almost immediately upon reading the clue.  Even without that you'll probably figure it out only a short way into the suspense development, leaving several chapters left for you to be annoyed by \\"genius\\" characters who can't figure out what you did eons ago.    Overall there's nothing going for it except unintentional comedy.  My wife and I both read it and have a few new running inside jokes due to it.  Problem is that's not nearly enough to make it worth reading.  I simply can't say enough bad things about this book.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Plot: A modern romantic tale about a young aristocratic heiress born under a curse that can only be broken when she finds true love with \\"one who will love her faithfully.\\"    This was a cute movie and I enjoyed it a lot. It is something the whole family can watch. The only thing that might be disturbing is in the beginning when a servant commits suicide. It goes by quickly and the narrator states that she fell. So, younger kids won't pick up on it. The plot is predictable. All fairy tales are, so I can't really fault it for that. It follows the procedure delightfully though. The cast is great and the mother played by Catherine O'Hara is priceless.
1595141979|5.0|This book, along with the others in the series, is just completely amazing. Higher than Twilight in my opinion. The stories have both romance yet action and for the last half of the book i was pasing around, dieing to know what happens. I couldnt turn the page fast enough!     Im not going to write about what it is about, because im pretty sure there are enough out there, but i am saying you have to read it!    My boyfriend called me alittle after i read it and all i could do was talk about it! I can not wait till August. Yes the ending maybe alittle sad.. but it just makes you more pumped up to see what the fourth is going to be like.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Wow, I took my nine-year-old daughter to see this today in 3D at the Imax theater.  I thought it was truly wonderful.  The characters were so realistic.  It brought tears to my eyes a few times.  I was sorry to read that the home movie 3D version was not that good.  This movie is honestly one of the best Christmas movies I have ever seen.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is a simply wonderful show thats filled with great actors, some good plots, and a great representation of a teenage Clark Kent. One minor disapointtment for me was the repetetive use of the \\"freak of the week\\", but the writers add extra and unique twists. I definitely recommend Smallville not only to the comic book lovers, but also to those who love a great show to watch
B0007PAMR4|5.0|Hey,  This has to be one of the best movies from the 80's, i went to see this move while i was still in high school and back then i was amazed, now days i had always hoped this movie would come to the DVD format, but i have to give this movie two thumbs up for Kyle McGlaughlin & Patrick Stewarts Performances.
1401216676|3.0|I had heard so much about this story that I may have set myself up for a letdown.  The art IS spectacular and it is a fine story.  I just walked away from it feeling like I had missed something.  It is no Watchmen or V for Vendetta.
B001GCUNVW|4.0|It's hard to imagine any actor but the thoroughly embattled Mickey Rourke in the title role of this unremittingly bleak 2008 character study of a pro wrestling star well past his prime and trying to figure out if he can have a life outside the ring. Unlike the heavily stylized work for which he is known ([[ASIN:078401213X Pi]], [[ASIN:B00005Q4CS Requiem for a Dream]]), director Darren Aronofsky takes a refreshingly straightforward approach here, and Roarke responds with a galvanizing performance that appears to blur the line between reality and fiction. A talented actor ([[ASIN:B00005JNTX Sin City]]) with a tattered career of early highs and all-too-many lows, much of them his own doing, he has such a firm grasp on his character's fatal flaws one can't help wondering how much art is imitating life. Regardless, the symbiotic result makes for an often powerful film-watching experience.<br /><br />Rourke plays blond-maned Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson whose professional glory peaked back in the 1980's. Two decades later, he finds his career relegated to small-time matches on the independent circuit in venues attended by only the most fanatical of his diminishing fan base. Living in a trailer he can barely afford, Randy lives on the edge of life, using a pharmacy of meds to hold his broken body together and going to a strip club where he finds himself drawn to a veteran lap dancer named Cassidy. Even in such desperate straits, he proves to be a decent man wracked with not only physical pain but a foreboding sense of his own mortality once he is hospitalized after a grueling match. The story focuses on his fumbling attempts to come to terms with what he wants from what's left of his life.<br /><br />That includes reconciling with his long-estranged daughter Stephanie who has grown bitter over years of being ignored, forming a lasting relationship with Cassidy beyond the next sixty dollars, and even quitting the ring entirely by working the deli counter at a local grocery store. However, the draw of a twentieth anniversary rematch with another iconic wrestler, the Ayatollah, pulls hard at him with the dream of recapturing his former glory. The storyline sounds predictable, and it is if you just take into account Robert Siegel's bare-bones screenplay, but it falls on Rourke's deeply felt work to thwart the clich&eacute;s. Only allowed to show the character in terms of his succession of failures, the actor brings aching heart and surprising sensitivity to a role that could have easily been mired in stereotype. His confessional at the deserted amusement park is heartbreaking.<br /><br />At the same time, with his physique made to look ravaged by steroids and ringside abuse, he is completely convincing in the ring as he orchestrates the elaborate moves to give his fans their money's worth. As the self-protective Cassidy, Marisa Tomei ([[ASIN:B00112S8RS Before the Devil Knows You're Dead]]) again proves what a fine, underrated character actress she can be as her character uneasily keeps Randy at arm's length when his need for intimacy threatens her insulated world. Evan Rachel Wood ([[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe]]) has less to do as Stephanie, but she punctuates her scenes with both visceral anger and poignant wariness. The film has an almost documentary feel about it thanks to Aronofsky's no-frills direction and Maryse Alberti's washed-out cinematography, but the approach is fitting given the gritty subject.e draw of a twentieth anniversary rematch with another iconic wrestler, the Ayatollah, pulls hard at him with the dream of recapturing his former glory.

B001DDBCUK|5.0|I waited to watch the ladies because I heard so many mixed reviews of the movie. So one day with nothing to do and a lot of time on my hands I watched..and I couldnt understand how one person was dissappointed by this movie. It answered every question that we always wanted to know once the series ended and I fell back in love with every character just like it was a Sunday night in front of the t.v. 4 years ago. If you are a die hard S&TC fan you will melt at the way the BOND remains the same between the ladies after all of thier life changes..true the addition of Carries assistant threw it off a little.. but a little extra never hurt anyone. I am glad I watched it was well worth the wait!
015206396X|3.0|As a new lover of The Hunger Games, I decided to try out Graceling because it is always heavily advertised with THG and I was looking for something new to read because I was going through just-finished-a-spectacular-life-changing-book-that-people-are-now-calling-out-but-I-don't-care-because-it-is-the-best-book-I've-ever-read-and-there-are-only-a-few-plots-in-the-world-so-deal-with-it-doomsayers syndrome. Graceling wasn't as good as THG, but it certainly was magnificent and beautiful in its own right, with plot turns that kept me going.     Katsa is a Graceling, and is equipped with a Grace of killing. Although in some circumstances this could be an upside, Katsa had grown to loathe it, mostly because her uncle, King Randa, uses her as a punishing machine for the kingdom. On a special mission Katsa meets a mysterious man, who changes her life forever by making her face the truth of her Grace and how she has her own power over it.   The beginning was really hard to get into, but once the plot got rolling at about page 70 it all turned out well. Katsa is a strong heroine, which I admire, and Po was a darling. It had a lot of action and adventure, and I loved Bitterbell. The only complaints I have is how it seemed very distant, the writing. I think it would be even better if it was 1st person. I also didn't think that King Leck had to be a raving maniac, but it didn't affect me too much. Overall though I was very pleased with the gorgeous prose and storyline. A good follow-up to the butt-kicking heroine spectrum. I just need more books like this...
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Pixar has been one of those animation studios that you could nearly say has a perfect track record. While everyone has their favorites and even ones that were marginally liked (such as \\"Cars\\") will still be defended by some so it seems like it should be any day now where they make that one film that everyone agrees it's just not up to snuff. Well keep waiting since \\"Wall-E\\", their 9th so far, not only continues their streak of perfect family movies that literally everyone can enjoy but it's become one of their best too. This film, along with for me \\"Toy Story\\" and my favorite \\"The Incredibles\\" ranks as the top they've done and this is easily one of the top films of 2008, animated or not.    It's 700 years into the future and mankind's wasteful habits have gotten the better of them and Earth's pollution and high amounts of trash have forced the planet to relocate on what was supposed to be a five-year trip while the \\"Buy n Large Corporation\\" would supply WALL-E's, or Waste Allocation Load Lifter: Earth Class, which would clean up the mess and allow the population to return. 5 years turning to the 700 we're at now, all that's left is one little Wall-E unit still functional and doing his job while also containing a private collection of goodies he finds along the way. But when he finds a plant and a spaceship containing a robot known as EVE arrives, the adventure takes them into the vast reaches of outer space as they attempt to get the populace to return and even learn how to love.    One of the bigger gambles Pixar did with this film is to have the bulk of the film without dialogue except for the occasional word spoken by Wall-E or Eve and many wondered whether this would sustain the kids attentions. I'm not sure about the kids since I never really saw them watch but it sure kept my attention. In fact, it's such a testament to the talent at Pixar that their storytelling has evolved from having one-liners spouted and in-jokes frequently that they can tell the story visually and everybody can follow along. I loved it so much that when the story takes a different turn and starts introducing more characters and dialogue, I didn't really lament it but they were doing so great with near-silent filmmaking that for them to go \\"okay,back to normal\\" was slightly disappointing. However, the film has a whole still works largely thanks to the 2 main characters and the emotions Pixar brings out of the 2.    Similar to how he did the sounds/dialogue for R2-D2 in the \\"Star Wars\\" films, sound designer Ben Burtt basically electronically altered his voice to supply Wall-E's mannerisms from that frightened tremble to the \\"whoa!\\" and even EVE's voice is perfectly suited for her and I actually started to just imitate them for the fun of it (\\"Eeeeee-vuh\\") but also supplying voices is Jeff Garlin known from the \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" television show, Sigourney Weaver as the ship's announcer and of course perennial favorite John Ratzenberger also returns. The music is actually quite delightful and one dance performed by the 2 is made the more magical by that whimsical piano piece playing in the background. Since sound is just as important in a film and not relying on dialogue as much is also a factor, the voice acting as well as the sound and music is perfect.    But then as I said in title, Pixar just seems to be miles ahead of the competition. Whereas others mainly focus on better and sharper textures to smoother animations, Pixar always seems to improve in many areas at once whenever they do a film and from not only the character animation and expressions but the gorgeous Axiom ship interiors, the wastelands of Earth and the space shots, they don't just slouch and make certain things improved, they seem to attack every area from lighting to textures to photorealistic environments, \\"Wall-E\\"'s Bluray is a perfect showcase for your new Bluray. Strangely though, they took a page from that dancing penguin movie and added real-life footage which is predominately starring comedian Fred Willard and while it works in the film, it's odd seeing an animated human watching a real-life human on video.    Wall-E is touching, heartfelt and while it was a gamble, it certainly paid off and not only is it a good science fiction story, it's an even better love story so this one's highly recommended.

0876852630|5.0|First, let me start by saying I am a big fan of Bukowski and have read a lot of his work.  Factotum is a very interesting and funny story about Henry Chinaski, the man of many jobs.  The book is divided into a bunch of very short chapters which usually explain the various jobs Henry gets hired into and subsequently fired for various reasons ranging from drinking on the job to yelling at the boss.  If you like other books by Bukowski you won't be disappointed.  This book is more enjoyable than the film staring Matt Dillon, although the movie isn't all that bad.  I highly recommend this book, and its a good place to start if you haven't read any other Bukowski yet.
0316113506|2.0|Whatever your problem is, exercise will very likely solve it. Whatever your dream is -- living longer, more energy, better mood, and so on -- exercise will make it come true. There. Now you've read the book.<br /><br />Well, you haven't quite read it... You will have missed hundreds of pages of dull and mostly irrelevant discussions of brain anatomy, neurotransmitters, and stress physiology. If you sometimes read about science, mood, stress, and so on, you've seen it all before.<br /><br />I gave this book two stars instead of one. I considered one. If you are thinking about exercising more, it's probably a good idea. This book might inspire you to get off the sofa and head to the gym. It deserves a little credit for that.<br /><br />The truth is, exercise might improve your mood, increase your intelligence, improve your educational success, cure your ADHD, or solve your addiction problem... Or, it might not. There's one way to find out, which is to try it. Exercise a lot, and stick with the program long enough to find out. Good luck with it.<br /><br />Recent research does seem to indicate that exercise can improve or cure depression, in some cases, and maybe help solve other problems, too. Don't get too excited, though. Most of this research consists of small studies, rat studies, test tube studies and poorly controlled studies. The \\"revolution\\" in exercise research has not yet occurred.<br /><br />The authors have never seen an exercise study they didn't like. They are enthusiasts and true believers. Drop a nickel in the slot -- what comes out? Big surprise! Exercise! Are there contrary studies? Do some people fail to benefit from exercise, and, if so, why? Are some methods more effective than exercise? Are some exercise studies so flawed that they should be disregarded? You'll never find out from reading this book.<br /><br />Spark is a hodgepodge of anecdotes, case studies from the author's clinical experience, summaries of scientific studies, commentary from the author and useless physiology lessons that almost every reader will skim or skip. It has no literary coherence, no theoretical or scientific coherence.<br /><br />Desperate to avoid obesity and diabetes, wishing to live longer, hoping to be more attractive, many people are exercising regularly. That's probably wise. Most people aren't exercising at all. It's probably better to exercise. That's about all you're going to learn from this book
B001GCUNVW|3.0|The film does a good job of immersing the audience in the lonely world of a \\"semi-pro\\" wrestler--how accurate it is I cannot say, but it certainly feels real. Mickey Rourke plays Randy \\"The Ram,\\" an 80s wrestling superstar (a la Hulk Hogan) turned half deaf grocery store clerk that can barley make payments on his rented trailer. The Ram's days of pay-per-view specials and selling out arenas are long gone yet he refuses to give up the spotlight of the ring and continues to do headliner gigs at small VFW halls and elementary school gymnasiums around New England.     The film's sub-plot ham handedly mirrors Randy's current place in life to the life of a local stripper (played by Marisa Tomei) that Randy's become smitten with. Mickey Rourke's performance as the titular wrestler is the most talked about aspect of this film, and rightly so as it's the only thing that really stands out in this surprisingly (considering all the Oscar buzz) by the numbers indie drama.
B0012EM5D8|1.0|We just saw the film yesterday and although it is technically a well-made film and the story and jokes are quite okay and nice, we were totally put off by the way nature and especially bees were presented. We think that a film for kids should also try to teach them something about the beautiful nature around them and not spawn false ideas about it that will stick forever. Other animal animation film crews took care first to learn something about the animals (movements, social activities, capacities) and then teach it to their young audience. Of course it is okay to turn a hive into a fabric, every child will see the exaggeration here. But neither are there male/female families in a hive, nor can bees fly 10 km above the ground alongside a plane with 600 km/h nor do flowers die because they are not pollinated nor will random pollen be any good for other kinds of flowers. None of these really wrong things about bees was necessary for the film, the whole story would have been as fun with the correct knowledge about bees. We're disappointed that DreamWorks didn't make the efforts to produce a more realistic film that entertains and teaches children at the same time.
0307455874|4.0|This book is a summary of Obama's world views and the personal experiences which helped reinforce those views.  It is not a biography, though some important biographical details are found throughout.  Mostly it focuses on his reflections on U.S. politics, inequality and opportunity, as well is issues of faith, race, and foreign policy.  As it is work written before his election as President, much of it focuses on politics is his challenges to being first elected as an Illinois Senator.  Obama's book is easily read, as it is written in a very accessible style.  He believes in a strong, limited, but progressive role of the United States government, which would help the poor and the marginalized, but also acknowledge the realities of a globalized economy.  There is still work to be done to heal racial prejudice and the injustices suffered as a consequence of it, and Obama is for women's freedom to choose abortion, if necessary, and to work as equal participants to men in the economy.  Religiously he also affirms his Protestant Christian world view.  Reading this book one finds a fairly comprehensive and centrist approach to American politics, which only those on the political extremes would object to.  It is informative, and certainly worth perusal.
B000000WJ2|5.0|contrary to most reviews i believe this to be better than his debut its a great record with many different styles that all rock the house down,the rolling stones haven't rocked this hard in years and it shows who the real creative force behind them is in my opinion.    anyway if you a fan of richards this is a must own.
B000055Y0X|5.0|I didn't get around to seeing this movie till I was almost thirty. I figured it would be another stupid overrated \\"classic\\" but instead I found out it's exactly the brilliant piece it's hailed to be. Peter Sellers is amazing here with his trio of performances, filling the screen with his virtuoso presence and embodying three characters who could not be any less similar. This is one of the funniest, scariest, most insane projects ever committed to film.
039925045X|5.0|I recommend it in my latest parenting book, \\"Kindergarten Simplified,\\" as a precusor to starting school.  It has all the draw of a wonderful children's book, i.e., beautiful illustrations, the curious holes in the pages, and the interesting story line.<br /><br />Best of all, your child will benefit from the \\"sponge effect\\" of hearing it over and over and learning the days of the week, numbers, sight words, and a little science lesson.
0689862725|5.0|Being a lifelong fan of Stephen King (I read his seminal NIGHT SHIFT collection when I was 8 or 9....), I just couldn't pass up a pop-up book (POP-UP STEPHEN KING!!!!!) based on one of his novels. It's been a while since I read THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON, but I remembered it as being especially well-suited to the pop-up format, seeing it was a kinder/gentler Stephen King novel.....After all, it had a young girl as the main character, and, while it had some genuinely creepy moments, it seemed like it could easily be watered down for a children's book.<br /><br /> Well, I was pleasantly surprised to find that this was NOT a watered-down children's  book; It's more an illustrated Reader's Digest condensed version of King's novel. The adaptation, by Peter Abrahams, flawlessly encapsulates the entirety of the source novel, hitting all the appropriate bases, and the illustrations, by Alan Dingman, compliment the text (And there's PLENTY of text, neatly hidden away among nifty little fold-out sections of the book....) perfectly. The real marvel here is Kees Moerbeek's paper engineering, which is a marvel to behold. The pop-ups are huge and inventive, there are little hidden doors to open, wheels to spin, mirror effects, faux rain and shooting star effects......THE GIRL WHO LOVED TOM GORDON: A POP-UP BOOK is probably the most fun I've had reading a book in a good long time. I can't recommend it highly enough.
B0013FSL3E|2.0|I love Pixar, but everyone preaching that Wall-E is some sort of modern masterpiece is making me sick.    Now the movie wasn't horrible, but come-on folks - it's nothing to tell your friends about and I certainly wouldn't watch it again.    I would actually say it's one of Pixar's poorest movies yet. Poor story, poor animation, poor music. Well ok, it was a horrible story. Haven't we seen/read/watched this same story a dozen times before? Add robots and it's new, right?    Reviewman says: Bargain DVD rack if you really need to buy it, got mine used for six bucks and feel I overpaid.
0800141806|5.0|When I first had the chance to preview a downloadable Flash Video version of \\"Philadelphia\\", I, like many other viewers and listeners, realize that a few valuable life lessons can be learned, especially when watching and listening to this film for the first time.<br />1. Discrimination against people because of a disability, or even just discriminating against people in general, under any circumstances, is not OK, especially name Calling. For centuries, people have been discriminated against because of their religion, age group, sexuality, customs, skin color, cultural upbringing, intelligence level, or even because they have a disability or a disease.<br />For example, I remember a time when I was living at Sheldon Oaks Apartments in Eugene, Oregon, which is like an Assisted Living Facility, more like a retirement home, for people who are 55 and older. When I was living there, I was surrounded by folks who thought that I may have been one of their granddaughters. They were thinking, \\"What's this 'Young Lady'  in their twenties doing in our facility?\\" Little did they know that I'm a 'young woman', not a 'Young Lady'. (I hate the term 'Young Lady' with a passion, and I would never address any females in that manner. I am a young woman who is totally blind, and has Autism Spectrum Disorder, which by the way is the full name of the disability. Those older folks consider people like me with Autism Spectrum Disorder to be nonverbal, unintelligent, good-for-nothing citizens. I happen to be one of those with Autism Spectrum Disorder who is extremely high-functioning, with an advanced level of intelligence, and I know full well that it's not OK to call females \\"Lady\\" or \\"Young Lady\\", according to the laws of morality. Calling people names that offend them is not OK!<br />2. People can come up with the phoniest excuses to fire someone from a job, only to hide the real reason why that person is being fired.<br />For example, I once worked at Lazar's Bazaar in Eugene, Oregon, lacing shoes, which by the way is hard to do when you can't see. Lazar is not only the store owner, but at the time that I worked there, he was also my boss. There came a day when I got fired from my job, just two months after Lazar had hired me. Instead of my boss making up a phony reason for me being fired, it was actually my family. For days, they had spread the news that I had allegedly spoken to my boss in a nasty tone of voice. However, Lazar revealed the real reason for letting me go, which was because my productivity wasn't good enough for him, in other words, my work wasn't fast enough for him. So remember, if you are a boss of a company, and you suddenly decide you want to fire someone from a job, don't make up phony excuses as to why they're being fired. Always tell them the truth!<br />3. Emotions are not something to be played with! When someone needs help, and especially medical help, try to ask that person what's the matter. Try to have them explain how they feel.<br />The scene that struck me is when Tom Hanks' character, Andrew Beckett, was in the men's restroom, and I believe he was going to the toilet. But while this was going on, I could've sworn I heard him crying. That made me want to come over to that restroom, put my arms around him, give him a big hug, gently pet him on the back, and say to him that everything's going to be all right. Crying is not uncommon --- Especially in guys! We all have feelings, and sometimes, feelings get hurt. Also, when someone is crying, it's not uncommon for another person  to stand there and make fake tears (a common facial expression where people pretend to be crying), and boo hoos (a common sound that people make when they mock someone who's crying.). I say, when anyone is crying, it's not cool to make fake tears and boo hoos! That only makes them cry more! When Tom Hanks emerged from rinsing his mouth (If I'm not mistaken, I believe he threw up in that scene, which probably explains the crying), when I heardhim say, \\"I think I need to go to the hospital\\", I knew right away that he was in desperate need of medical help. If someone is feeling pain or discomfort, ask them in a tender tone if everything's all right, and try to help them in their situation, whatever the problem may be.<br />4. This whole world, and especially the city of Philadelphia, is in desperate need of Brotherly and Sisterly Love. For those who may not know, the name Philadelphia is Greek. It comes from the words, \\"Philos\\", which means \\"Love\\" or \\"Loving\\", \\"Adelphos\\", which means \\"Brother\\", \\"Brothers\\", or \\"Brotherly\\", and \\"Adelphia\\", which means \\"Sister\\", \\"Sisters\\", or \\"Sisterly\\". It is high time we take a moment  to come together, give peace a chance, live in perfect harmony, stop the fights and the wars, Stamp out the Profanity and the name calling, put an end to hating and killing each other, and once and for all, bring the Brotherly and Sisterly Love back home to Philadelphia!to go to the hospital\\", I knew right away that he was in desperate need of medical help.

B0009S2T0M|4.0|I had no idea what this film was about, but I got it for xmas.. I have a great dvd collection, and I love foreign films.. I was excited to recieve such a present from my uncle... So I decided to sit down with my mom and watch it. Yea, big mistake.. At first we were both enjoying it, at the teeth scene she was screaming.. (pretty funny).. and when remembering the old high school days, I figured out the entire plot.. My mom didnt believe me, so she sat through the whole movie-- hoping that I was wrong.. Sorry mom to dissapoint, its not a disney movie.. Anyways very disturbing movie, that has a great score, suspensful action and more.. But it def isnt for the average joe. At the end my mother said she never wants to watch another movie my uncle gives me again.. lol  I read some reviews and people on here overrate the violence factor, but to each his own. I would reccomend to rent first.
0060899220|4.0|By all accounts, this should be a lousy book. The life story of a middle-aged, former substance-abusing, self-described SOB and good-but-not-great chef. In the hands of most people, this would be a rambling, uninteresting memoir that would never see the light of day. The fact that Bourdain pulls it off so brilliantly speaks to his ability as a writer and his unpretentious, anti-hero personality.<br /><br />This book made Bourdain famous, but ironically I found this book because he is famous. I enjoy his TV show, and I happened to see this book in the bookstore so I picked it up. As I was paying for it, the cashier mentioned that she'd just bought it for a friend for Christmas and couldn't stop reading it herself. That added to my already-present optimism that this would be a good read.<br /><br />Bourdain presents a fascinating glimpse into the world of cooking, as seen through the filter of his own experience. He is perfectly candid about the fact that the pirate ship-like working atmosphere he has experienced--full of drugs, sex, testosterone, and booze--is likely a reflection of his own personality. He goes to such pains to \\"keep it real\\" that he even provides a glimpse into the operations of chefs other than himself, whom he freely admits are more talented and successful than him. All the while, the reader has the pleasure of enjoying the ever witty, sarcastic, and brutally honest company of Bourdain as he strolls down memory lane and creates his portrayal of the culinary industry.<br /><br />A wonderfully crafted, page-turning, guilty-pleasure kind of book, reading it will never allow you to look at eating in a restaurant in the same way ever again. In an age where cooking as become more glamorous and high profile, where cooking shows of all ilks appear on multiple networks, Bourdain's experiences have a bit of a feel of a nostalgic look at times gone by. Bourdain clearly appreciates the irony of becoming the very thing he made a habit of ridiculing: the celebrity chef. Yet, throughout it all, Bourdain shows a single-minded honesty, curiosity, and passion for food which makes him oddly engaging despite his vices. This, plus his quirky personality and interesting anecdotes make for a highly memorable and enjoyable read.t it all, Bourdain shows a single-minded honesty, curiosity, and passion for food which makes him oddly engaging despite his vices.

B00005221M|2.0|I agree with so many that the director ruined this beautiful movie when he put it on DVD.  I will be digging out my VHS version.  The original VHS had a wonderful flow with powerful music like \\"I will Find you\\" by Clannad that was cut from the DVD to my disappointment.  The DVD scenes are choppy and rushed so that the intensity and emotion of the movie cannot build and by cutting some of the most romantic music of the soundtrack, the movie was further diminished.  Soooo sad.
B001KEGRC0|5.0|We saw this movie at the IMAX in Chicago Science Museum yesterday.  It was an excellent mix of documentary account of a family's journey by raft down the canyon, sweeping views from many different angles of many sections of the canyon, and white-knuckle rafter's eye views through rapids.    The soundtrack really fitted the movie well, especially in the IMAX with the mega screen and loud surround sound.  It's all by the Dave Matthews Band (as soon as I get home and on my own PC I'm going to buy the mp3 download from Amazon).    This movie really shows you clearly what impact mankind has had on the Colorado River in terms of the total amount of water flowing through it, the flora and fauna along it, the lifestyle of the people who traditionally depended on it, etc.  It also provides some very practical ideas for how we can all contribute to water conservation.    Overall, that's a big thumbs up from the four of us :)
B000068FWC|5.0|Even though, in 1979, I was a sort of full-time musician; and I guess I believed my guitar player when he told me that the Who had had to change their name to \\"Supertramp\\" after that disasterous concert.  Thankfully, \\"Goodbye Stranger\\" and \\"The Logical Song\\" surpassed most of everything else that was released in 1979 (yeah...\\"Bad Girls\\"...\\"The Wall\\"...\\"The Long Run\\"...even Mick Taylor's long-awaited solo album...you know, YOU were there...)  And to a you-know-what-besotted 25 y/o musician, I learned of the veracity of the old adage, \\"You can always tell a good album by its cover\\" after gazing at the \\"Breakfast\\" album cover with an...\\"enhanced\\" set of eyes.  It HAD to be good, and I wasn't wrong.  Between gigs in Atlanta and Mississippi, my band spent the rest of that summer giggling at the cover and trying to learn \\"Goodbye Stranger.\\"  Great music here, folks, and this is probably where Supertramp peaked.  They'd shortly lose guitarist/keyboardist/vocalist-extraordinare Roger Hodgson to general ennui and \\"bad vibes.\\"  And after seeing that gent with Ringo in 2001, I realized how important he'd been to the Supertramp sound.  Be that as it may, \\"Breakfast\\" was where Hodgson and other keyboardist/vocalist/songwriter Rick Davies were in perfect synchronization.  And that factor, along with the beneficial contributions of reeds player John Halliwell, bassist Dougie Thompson, and drummer Bob Seibenberg, made \\"Breakast In America\\" THE album of 1979.  Oh and BTW, be sure to read reviewer Alan Caylow's appraisal of \\"Breakfast\\" (above) - and if you can ever access the story where Supertramp and Procol Harum shared a gig, and only Procol's Chris Copping and Supertramp's Seibenberg actually showed up, and the two of them actually almost pulled the gig off, playing all the instruments - read it: it's hilarious, and it shows why Rock and Roll was so much more...\\"prolific\\" then as compared to anything post-1980.  Enjoy yourself!

B001DU8T6S|4.0|I was all set to review this CD after hearing it once, then decided to listen again. My initial review would have been three stars, but I feel four is more appropriate.  The title track is perhaps my least favorite on the CD. My favorites are: 'Small' (which sounds as if it could have come off the past Queen album 'The Game\\"); 'We Believe', which has a great Brain May guitar; 'Some Things That Glitter' and 'C-Lebrity' (Which, along with 'Call Me' I could imagine Freddie singing.)  There are a couple more bluesy tracks, especially 'Through the Night', and while maybe not a great song, 'Surf's Up...' is a lot of fun.  I had hoped for more Queen-like harmonies and Brian May guitar solos, but if you take this as a collaboration of May/Taylor/Rodgers and not a continuation of old Queen, I think you'll really enjoy it.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I was just thinking about it and it occurred to me that this is a perfect product for me to review. Why? Rush has been my favorite band since 1978. Ok, Dream Theater has tied that mark since 1992, but I digress... I am a semi-professional photographer (i.e. picture quality) for 6 years (and a photographer for 35 years & have been a more than obsessive hobbyist, but the recording kind (6 CD's in the last 18 years), musician for 25 years, with Rush as one of my key influences. And of course, I've seen them on every tour since 1980 and I saw them 5 times on the tour from which this was culled. So, OK, it's not from a neutral perspective. But it is from a very knowledgeable perspective. This review is from one Rush fan to another...    With that said, having seen the show twice on leg 1 and 3 times on leg 2, I can say the contents of this DVD compared to my memory of the five shows I saw ranks equal to the second best of those two and thus slightly less than the best show out of all five.     The first leg shows were unique in that not 1, but 3 songs that either had not been played live at all (Entre Nous) or not in roughly 24 years or more (Digital Man, Circumstances) were included in the setlist. Only Digital Man remained from those 3 in the second leg. However, Ghost of a Chance, a gem of a song from Roll the Bones, which had been sadly ignored since that tour, was added in place of Entre Nous on the second leg and a few more classic standards were played as well. This tour included the most material from a new album by Rush (Snakes & Arrows) since the late 80's, and the quality of the newest album warranted this.      Rush is the type of band that likes to settle on a set list and continue perfecting the execution of it throughout the tour. From a very old interview, I recall them saying they wanted every fan to have the same experience. This would explain the similarity in the show throughout a tour. The nature of their perfectionism seems to allow them to do thisand stay interested.    Anyway, to specify the items which I believe are highlights, I would say that Digital Man is definite highlight. The arrangement is altered slightly to remove the middle iteration of the bridge and head straight into the solo section, and execute the bridge as only an outro with Geddy Lee jamming the bass out on it instead of being locked to a keyboard. That part always seemed awkward and what they did in terms of arrangement was precisely what I had hoped for. Oddly, though this is a highlight, I believe that Alex nailed the solo slightly better on several of the shows I saw, especially the one in Orlando, which is why I rate it higher. He still nails it here, just slightly sloppier on the fast lick. I'm nitpicking, but it's true.    The next highlight is Freewill. Surprisingly, since I thought the Exit Stage Left version was so perfect. And while that's true, there are several reasons why this one stands close to that, or alongside it. First, the solo section is simply amazing. In particular, the camera work - which is stunning throughout this video - is absolutely amazing on this song's solo section. It has to be seen to be believed and the band just nailed it too. Perhaps the Exit Stage Left guitar shreds slightly hotter and Neil drums a little harder then, but there's a maturity in the execution here that compensates, and the intensity level is still so high, it shouldn't be plausible for men their age, LOL. Oh yea, and Geddy nails the high notes on the Bridge, just as he did in each of the shows I saw.    There are many, many more highlights, and every song lives up to any other version you may have seen elsewhere, so I won't belabor each one in agonizing detail.    I will move onto sound quality. This is the best sound quality of the three modern era videos/DVD's they've released, hands down. I have a DVD version as well that I play if I'm somewhere where Blu Ray isn't convenient. So I've played the audio through both my surround system in my house and through the system in my car's DVD/CD/NAV. In the car, when choosing the surround option, I have noticed that Geddy's bass sound stands out in a way where his tone is particularly distinguishable and it is positively perfect. It has the growl, the grind, of his Moving Pictures sound. The Fender Jazz is the reason and it is doing the job superbly. Every instrument is clear and powerful, both crisp and punchy at the same time, and they sound excellent in both the car and at home. A stellar job.    Finally, I will get to the camera work. This is as much a highlight of this DVD as Rush is. The work is so good throughout it absolutely slays the rest of their videos. In Blu Ray it is possible to see the crispness of the work also. You realize how quickly and precisely these excellent professionals obtain and maintain subject focus. This has to be one of the best crews I've seen. I know it's at least partly automated because of the occassional view of the auto camera sliding across the front of the stage. And there are numerous angles, allowing a perfect mix of angles for the Rush fan to see. Every time you think they couldn't get tighter, the angle gets tighter. This is ultimately typified by the work on Freewill, as mentioned above.    One thing I would elaborate on is to get into the Bonus material from Atlanta. I do not feel this crew did quite as good a job as the Rotterdam crew. It was good but not at that level. This is especially noticeable immediately. On the first song, Ghost of a Chance, there is a lot of Red in the lighting. As a photogrpher that attempted to photo this band in the early 80's (when they were still cool enough to let you bring in a 35mm SLR), I know Red is the biggest pain in the tush for getting sharp pictures. Nevertheless, these are pros getting paid big money, and the shots are clearly back focused and Geddy is softly focused. There are a few other instances in this 26 minutes of Bonus material where you see the slightly lesser quality of the work by the cameraman.     Having said that, I would like to point out that I have also watched this on DVD on a standard resolution TV. And I would like to say that this Bonus material offers the perfect opportunity for anyone trying to convince their spouse or whomever that Blu Ray is significantly better, the reason why that is. The focus issue that was utterly obvious on Blu Ray is totally undiscernible on a standard resolution TV. It's already so much softer, it's evened out. It's a perfect tool to make that point completely clear.     The setlist here has quite a few of the standards but contains so much material that is newly available, it is well worth it for that reason alone. However, this is a Top Quality performance among Top Quality Shows - clearly among the best. And this is the best camera work I've ever seen on a live DVD. The audio is at least nearly the best, if not the best, that I've heard as well. Pure quality on every front.

We can't wait for the next one to come out!  My son (8) even wants to have this for his birthday party theme.  They're as good as Harry Potter.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I enjoyed this film immensely, and after watching it the second time understood it even better than the first time. The acting and singing is fantastic for the most part, and it is at times suspenseful, humorous, romantic, intense, and moving.   The Phantom sings with great emotion and depth, and he grows on me the more I watch the movie. At first I didn't like his voice, but then I listened to the original cast recording and (sorry Michael Crawford) I find him much better than the original Phantom.   Christine has a very beautiful voice and the acting on her part is done wonderfully, giving her a refreshing youthful innocence and faith.  Raoul has a magnificent voice, and he is also portrayed superbly as the very kind and handsome opera house patron.  This movie is wonderful and not to be missed!
0307387178|5.0|\\"What a waste.\\" That's how I must sum up my reaction to the death of Chris McCandless from starvation, after he found himself unable to walk out of the Alaskan bush once he'd decided it was time to return to civilization. McCandless - or \\"Alexander Supertramp,\\" as he preferred being called - walked into the bush in April, determined to experience living off the land in total isolation. By that time he'd been out of contact with his family for two years. Yet he died inside the sleeping bag his mother made for him...author Krakauer does a fine job of helping the reader understand why McCandless behaved as he did, but I still found this book incredibly sad reading. I saw in its subject a boy trying to grow up, and killing himself (however unintentionally) in the process.<br /><br />Difficult and painful to read, but intriguing and worth the time.
B000E41MS6|4.0|Doctor Who is a wonderful series that takes all viewers on a trip and expands a person's normal universe exponentially. Each episode details the adventures of a time lord, a type of alien in the show, called the Doctor and the companions that come along for the journey. Its a Sci-fi classic and a must see for anyone who enjoys watching random adventures and the occasional technobabble    Christopher Eccleston's portrayal of the 9th incarnation of the Doctor, brings a comedic no-nonsense sarcasm to this series that breathes life into this once dead series. Billie Piper is Rose Tyler the newest companion and grounds the Doctor, and while he shows her new worlds, she shows him a new perspective.    All in all I highly recommend this to all who are interested in wanting to begin watching this series or any one who really enjoys Sci-fi.
0385339100|4.0|Took this one on vacation with me to Florida, it's one of those books you cannot put down. The opening six chapters or so are excellent (although the torture scenes were a little too much for me, so I speed read those!), and i absolutely love court room scenes, and Grisham is by far the king of those. This is perhaps my seventh Grisham novel, I think the guy keeps getting better and better, certainly this book has a more polished feel (perhaps he was writing with a movie in mind, but you never know). It does certainly read like a Hollywood movie - I'll have to check after this review wether it's been made into one. Overall, a fantastic vacation read and highly recommended. I love stories, and as stories go this is great. He doesn't waste too much time on descriptions and flowery language, and the plot moves along at a thrilling pace.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I watched this film in its entirety. I was too captivated, I could not break it up into partial views.     Wonderful acting, wonderful story, and chracters. This one goes on my top list of BBC films along with Pride and Prejudice w/Colin Firth.     ***** 5
B0017ANAZO|1.0|i thought meg ryan was the best in the movie and i dont even think she is a good actress. were they supposed to be over acting so much? the huffs and ridiculous faces. maybe i have never seen jada smith in a movie and only know her from the tabloids, but she was the worst. i thought annette benning was like watching a bad diane keaton imitation. it was bad bad  bad. not funny at all, not one chuckle. glad i was multi tasking while watching this.
B001O5LVPI|5.0|At the time of this review, here are the bonus features included in this two-disk set.  Keep in mind, this could change, so take it for what it's worth.<br /><br />*Deleted scenes<br />*Music videos by A-Teens and the Hawaiian Chorus<br />*Lilo and Stitch Island Adventure Games<br />*Disneypedia: Hawaii<br />*A Stitch in Time<br />*(more to come)<br /><br />To say that this release has been a long-time coming would be an understatement.  As a huge fan of this film, the three that followed it, and the television series, to finally see this movie given the royal treatment is a real treat.<br /><br />While Disney's 2-D animated films of this decade have not exactly set the entertainment world on fire, I have enjoyed many of them very much, \\"Emperor's New Groove\\" and \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire\\", included.  This movie was the next in line after those two; it went on to gross $127 million at the box office and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature.<br /><br />\\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is the story of a young Hawaiian girl, Lilo, who chances upon what she thinks is an unusual-looking dog in an animal shelter.  She takes this strange creature into her home...and everything goes completely nuts.  The blue \\"abomination\\" (as he is called in the film) turns out to be an alien science experiment gone awry, with a renegade spirit and a hunger for distruction.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film, I won't go into many more details, because I don't want to give the movie away.  But trust me when I say this: \\"Lilo & Stitch\\" is one Disney animated film that is worth your time.  It is funny, touching, engaging, witty, heartfelt; you name it.<br /><br />And for those of us who have seen this movie, who LOVE this film, who consider it to be one of the best things to ever come out of the House of Mouse...this two-disk set is a long-time coming.
B00005JO20|1.0|You would think after making the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy--surely the most gargantuan undertaking in Hollywood history--that Oscar-winning director Peter Jackson could be relied upon to produce a superior remake of the legendary, 101-minute classic adventure movie \\"King Kong\\" (1933) than director John Guillerman's 135 minute, modern-day \\"King Kong\\" (1976) remake. Sadly, what should have happened does not! \\"King Kong\\" (no stars out of ****) the third time around amounts to the biggest pile of monkey shines since the hilariously outrageous Kong parody \\"The Mighty Gorga\\" (1969) with Anthony Eisley. Although Universal Studios will undoubtedly recoup their bucks from this blatantly bad banana peel of a movie, they will have to keep their public relations people scurrying like baboons 24/7 to ensure that this time-consuming 3-hour & 7-minute, $300 million slip-up turns a profit. Indeed, Jackson retains the Depression-Era setting of the original, but he wastes at least 90 minutes on stuff that could have been cut without harming the dramatic impact. Worse, the remake does not fix lapses in credibility that the original \\"King Kong\\" got away with because audiences in the 1930s were not as savvy as today's moviegoers. Transporting King Kong from Skull Island back to New York was the chief problem that the movie ignored. In the modern-day \\"King Kong,\\" the oil company locked the giant ape up inside a supertanker and shipped him back to New York. Essentially, the story remains the same: a band of adventurers take a tramp steamer to an uncharted island. They discover primitive islanders who sacrifice virgins to a humongous 25 foot ape. When the islanders catch a glimpse of the nubile white maiden among the while men, they kidnap her, offer her as a sacrifice to King Kong, and our heroes plunge into the interior to rescue her.<br /><br />Basically, Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" collapses under the weight of too many characters, too much plot, and second-rate special effects. Not only do the actors clearly appear green-screened into scenes featuring stampeding dinosaurs and elaborate miniature sets (the integration of live actors with artificial footage is far from seamless), but also the special effects background shots resemble those cheap, paint-by-the-numbers, watercolor kits. While Guillerman's \\"King Kong\\" (that starred Jeff Bridges and launched Jessica Lange to stardom) took a critical drubbing, it stands head and shoulders above Jackson's ape-solutely awful rehash. Even the campy Japanese movies: \\"King Kong Vs. Godzilla\\" (1963) and \\"King Kong Escapes\\" (1967) are more entertaining. Surprisingly, despite several scenes of intense violence, the Motion Picture Association of America gave the new \\"King Kong\\" a family friendly PG-13 rating. Mind you, adolescent boys have always loved dinosaurs duking it out. Nevertheless, one scene teems with antennae-twitching, creepy-crawlers that would send anybody off on a super bug-spray shopping spree. The most reviling scene in this mind-numbing marathon of mediocrity occurs when enormous earthworms attack a sailor. These long slimy, egg-roll brown mutants sprout large bubble-gum pink heads wreathed with razor-sharp white fangs. In a graphic long shot, one icky earthworm attaches itself to the head of a man and sucks him up inside its mouth. Nothing like this happened in either the original \\"King Kong\\" or the 1976 modern-day remake and its 1986 sequel \\"King Kong Lives.\\"<br /><br />Jackson and co-scenarists Fran Walsh & Philippa Boyens of \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy violate the first rule of remakes: if it ain't broke, don't fix it. First, they convert action hero Jack Driscoll (Oscar-winner Adrien Brody of \\"The Pianist\\") into a Federal Theater playwright. Second, they add a surplus of new unnecessary characters. One pointless subplot involves an adult African-American ship's lieutenant and a young white sailor. The new \\"Kong\\" also adds matin&eacute;e-idol movie star Bruce Baxter (Kyle Chandler of\\"Mulholland Falls\\") and turns the Skull Island natives into scary \\"Lord of the Rings\\" type cannibals. These bloodthirsty primitives are especially disgusting with their mutilated faces and milky-white eyes. Third, Skull Island itself looks like something from a surreal comic book with giant rocks shaped like gorilla heads while thousands of skeletons litter the landscape like something out of the 1984 movie \\"The Killing Fields\\" that depicted the carnage in Cambodia under Pol Pot's murderous regime. Jackson shoots all this in a semi-documentary style to sicken us. The phony-looking mammoth wall that separates the village from the island interior here looks like a poor poultry-wire model. \\"Ring\\" horror movie beauty Naomi Watts takes over the role of Ann Darrow created by Fay Wray in the original. Watts has a different kind of relationship with Kong. She cannot figure out whether she fears Kong or pities him. In two scenes, she performs vaudeville routines, juggling rocks and turning cartwheels, to amuse the big ape. Not even the fabulous Empire State Building finale can salvage this overripe remake. Despite its primitive movie-making effects, the original \\"King Kong\\" proved a magical experience for bewitched Depression-Era audiences that had never seen anything like it. The long-winded, unwieldy, new remake focuses more on mayhem than magic. The dinosaurs pale by comparison with those in the \\"Jurassic Park\\" trilogy. Altogether, you'll have more fun watching the black & white 1933 original or the Technicolor 1976 remake than Jackson's bloated, over-hyped hokum.nd turns the Skull Island natives into scary \\"Lord of the Rings\\" type cannibals.

B000F6YW0S|5.0|The playing is absolute genius, a tour de force of subtle shaping, phrasing, articulation and architecture. Williams must have been possessed when he made this, because its his best work, and almost otherworldly in perfection and grace. It has an inner pulse, a 'drive' if you will, that floats and dances, that has totally surrendered to the inner pulse of Bach. I can almost hear echoes of the best of Gould here in the boney, strident tone (but still warm in a strange way), rhythmic drive, and the total control over each voice.
1558216847|5.0|I got this book from my school's library last year thinking it would be interesting, seeing as it had a general WWII theme (i love war literature), but I was surprised.  This book is unequaled.  It shows you an entirely new perspective of human potential.    Really, you'll be taken aback.
0545128285|1.0|My 9 year old sons and I have been reading all 7 Harry Potter books, one by one, for the past 18 months, and just finished the \\"Deathly Hallows\\" on Christmas Eve. We were so sad to leave Harry and friends. So I was thrilled when \\"Beetle the Bard\\" came out just in time.  My kids opened it Christmas morning and we began reading that evening. I was HORRIFIED! Even as an adult I found nothing charming, witty, fun, or remotely interesting about any of these gruesome, sick tales. I'm frankly a bit shocked by the book. My kids were a bit confused by the tales and totally disappointed. So was I.  If you loved the Harry Potter books, I'm not sure you'll love this book. The tale of the Three Brothers was told in \\"Deathly Hallows\\" and that was good enough. It's cheap enough to buy and look at thank goodness.  I'm so glad I didn't buy the $100 version which I was tempted to do as a lover of Harry and friends.  Read with caution.
B001FB55LM|4.0|Carl Allen (Jim Carrey) is an exaggerated version of anyone who has difficulty committing to things (or people). The events in his life have caused him to shy away from any engagement, regardless of how innocent; something needs to change. Coincidentally Carl runs into an old friend who says that becoming a \\"Yes Man\\" has changed his life. A Yes Man, from the seminar Carl attends, is someone who takes a vow not to turn down any new opportunities, effectively saying \\"yes\\" to everything. Carl commits to changing his life; he takes the Yes Man vow and attacks life with new vigor.    I can understand that an actor wants to grow and continually take on new challenges, but Jim Carrey is so incredibly talented as a comedic leading man. Some people consider his more serious roles as worthwhile endeavors, but I disagree. The only move away from comedy that I have forgiven Mr. Carrey is Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and I will go so far as to say that it is one of my favorite movies. Jim Carrey brings a funny movie to life. Yes Man is a blend of the funny and dramatic movies that Carrey has done. The movie is full of laughs, but it has a stomachable, if not endearing message. He does add a few of his (over-the-top) ad-lib moments, but you wouldn't watch Good Times and not expect Jimmie Walker to say \\"Dy-no-mite!\\" either.    Zooey Deschanel was perfect as the movie's leading lady. She provided the perfect amount of eccentricity to play Yin to Carl Allen's pre-vow Yang. She is cute and I am glad they didn't cast someone more socially-deemed \\"beautiful\\" to play this part, because it would not have been believable. She is great.    Rhys Darby was a great choice for Norman, Carl's boss. He was great in the part and the two costume parties he throws might have been the two main highlights of the movie for me. We'll see if this movie can give him a more mainstream American following than his work on Flight of the Conchords. He is very entertaining.    I took Yes Man in as amatinee with the family. Granted, it is a family that currently has no little children, but it was a great family movie. There were a lot of laughs and a tender moment or two for the romantics amongst us (but be wary of some offensive language). This is not an award-winning film, but I enjoyed it a good deal.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|It's sad that this season was cut short by the writers strike, but the episodes are still worth watching. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki shine in their roles as brothers Dean and Sam. Katie Cassidy is also well cast as that brothers supposed ally Ruby.      Sadly, the special features are lacking, but the DVD does feature the series' funniest gag reel yet, something fans of the show will find especially entertaining.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The film gets 4.9 stars in my opinion (there are a few things I could nit-pick, but I won't), it is one of the best comic-adaptations ever, and the DVD has all that I would want plus the digital copy.     I generally don't watch bonus features on DVD's, nor do I buy DVD's for the bonus features.  However, in this case the digital copy was worth the money.  You can have a (legal) easy-to-obtain copy for windows media or for iPod/iPhone.
0307269752|5.0|Re; the Girl with the dragon Tattoo & the Girl who played with fire<br />have read both and note that the new novel 'the girl who played with fire' is much better. it makes the characters believable by going in detail into their history and resulting psychological profiles, at the same time it is a white knuckles thriller.<br />I strongly recommend this book.<br />for some strange reason it was available in English prior to Christmas everywhere except USA. cant wait for the third book in the series, will there be a fourth? apparently Larsen wrote half of the 4th before suffering a fatal heart attack.
0060786523|5.0|I lost myself in India multiple times when reading this epic.  My family would tease me for not hearing them trying to get my attention.  Seth's skill in weaving so many vivid characters together is tremendous.  The variety of communication struck me:  internal thoughts, dialogue, letters, speeches, prayers.   Bravo, Vikram Seth.
B001J1O848|5.0|\\"You live into a bubble; don't know how the world is\\". These are the last words after an unpleasant discussion between this veteran of Intelligence service and his ex-wife about giving permission his daughter of just seventeen to make a travel for Paris.<br /><br />Written by Luc Besson and directed by a young director, Peter Morel, this thriller is told according the basic rules of this genre. It carves in relief the state of things in which the daughter of a divorced couple plans to make a trip to Paris in company of her friend Amanda (secretly they have decided to follow the musical schedule to U2), but his father who worked into the Intelligence Service is well aware about the dangerous situation.<br /><br />Liam Neeson (an actor of multiple artistic skills who should be more requested) makes a very credible performance acting like the avenger father who will travel to Paris breaking any kind of law to find her, because he just has 80 hours to avoid she was sent to other destinies.<br /><br />Full action, marvelous car chases, brutal violence and bloody scenes make this movie an admirable vehicle of entertainment.<br /><br />Somehow this movie made me remind that psycho thriller of the 80's Frantic directed by Polanski and acted by Harrison Ford, in which his wife is kidnapped, in Paris.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Cars is about the only feature length movie that my little kids can watch without having to be afraid that the main character(s) are going to be killed.  How is it that so many \\"kids\\" movies feature scene after scene of the animated characters (usually animals) running for their lives under the threat of death?  \\"Finding Nemo\\" coming to mind right away.  Not only all that issue, but the movie starts with the mother and all of Nemo's siblings getting killed.  Do children really need to contemplate this possibility?  I also checked out \\"A Bug's Life.\\"  The grasshoppers are really scary, threaten the life of the little ant, Dot, and also plan to kill the reigning Queen.  Then there's the scene with the bird trying to eat them.  And of course the end where Flick maneuvers Hopper into a location so that he can get captured by a bird, and then - of all things! - fed to the baby birds.      I really don't understand why kids movies, in general, feature that kind of \\"life and death\\" tension.  Plenty of adult movies don't have those themes and are nonetheless compelling.  And that's what we have with Cars.  No one is trying to kill anyone - whew!  And although Chick Hicks is \\"the bad guy\\" and \\"a meanie,\\" he's only is a small portion of the movie.  And the aggressive stuff he does is pushing and shoving the other cars, which isn't great, but at least it's not some animated animal punching, kicking, biting, and/or stomping on another.  Chick Hicks aside, the main storyline of the movie is about Lightening McQueen's personal growth and what he learns about friendship and life.  These are an appropriate topics for children to consider, in my opinion!  These are issues that I expect my children to confront in their own lives, unlike (God willing) running for their lives and/or getting beaten senseless and/or losing family members to acts of violence and/or engineering a situation that results in the death of their \\"enemies.\\"    In summation, I wish there were other great, high quality movies out there that can appeal to kids (and adults!) without resulting to violence and death as motivating factors for the characters.  Cars proves that we can be motivated by other things than these, such as what it means to have a friend and be a friend.
032147404X|2.0|Before reading this book, I know literally nothing about photography. I bought it because of its high ratings and that it is recommended on some websites.    Although it provides some good tips, overall I am disappointed because it doesn't offer any basics at all. I skipped the wedding chapter and sports chapter because I didn't even know all the basics of photography. There isn't much content in the book, except some random tips and resources. That's why I am giving it a 2 star rating. It's my personal view, but I think your satisfaction level will depend on how much you expect from its price.    For beginners, I would highly recommend [[ASIN:0817463003 Understanding Exposure: How to Shoot Great Photographs with a Film or Digital Camera (Updated Edition)]]. It helps you really understand the most important basics, and thus it's a lot more worth the money.
B001GKJ2FC|1.0|This movie was stupid!  The plot was retarded.  I felt that I lost a few IQ points watching it.
B001DHXT2U|5.0|This is another fantastic movie made about a Marvel superhero. The Hulk  was one of my favorite characters when I was a kid. I am now 56. The  lead character is played by Edward Norton in the role of Bruce Banner.  He is exposed to gamma radiation which in turn creates the Hulk when he is angered. He is pursued by General Ross who wants to create a super soldier in the mold of the Hulk. His daughter is the love of Banner's life. Banner escapes from South America and returns to America to see Betty Ross. He is again pursued by General Ross. There is nonstop action  of the Hulk doing battle with the Army soldiers. General Ross has a major  played by Emil Blonsky. The major wants to be a monster like the Hulk. He  is finally able to do this. He is horrible and mean. He and the Hulk have  a battle to the death. It is quite a contest. The special effects in this movie are unbelievable. Be sure to see this movie. You will not be dissapointed.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|North and South is a powerful narrative about two people, separated by class and culture, and the larger social issues that keep them apart but ultimately unite them. The story is supported by a ridiculously talented cast; brilliant, subtle direction; and a sumptuous, soaring score. While some may feel that the largely industrial setting detracts from the overall appeal of the film, director Percival \\"pastoralizes\\" the \\"dirty, smoky\\" town of Milton, and the viewer finds beauty in the pride and work ethic of many of Milton's people, transforming it into a natural world of sorts, amplified by the snowy appearance of the bits of cotton that drift about the mill, and the daily \\"country walks\\" Margaret (Daniela Denby-Ashe) takes through the local cemetery. There are other wonderful juxtapositions, like the dark-haired, black-clad John Thornton (portrayed to perfection by Richard Armitage, a new favorite), as he strides masterfully amid the white cotton drifts at Marlborough Mills. Positively delightful. If you appreciate literary adaptations, period dramas, or, simply, a story well told, North and South is definitely the sort of film you want in your personal collection.
B000SEVVLK|3.0|This book certainly wasn't literary excellence, however it was not as bad as some made it sound.  I found the plots light and intriguing.  The characters did annoy me at times, but all in all it was a fun, &#34;in between something heavy&#34; book. It is supposed to be light reading people, take it for what it is. I thought it was good chicklit.
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|Who'd of thought that [[ASIN:B000001DZO ABBA]] songs could be so operatic? Certainly not me! The fact that I hadn't seen the stage-play (by the same name) probably added to my surprise.<br /><br />Being no fan of that Swedish rock group of the 70s and 80s, I was doubly surprised to find myself enjoying this film so much. In no small measure was my enjoyment thanks to the all-star cast, no doubt, but also how well incorporated the songs were within the story.<br /><br />The story is worthy of a Shakespearean comedy with high confusion, paternal bonds in question, and lady-love finding its way into the audiences heart in unusual ways. The story, this time, revolves around Sophie (Amanda Seyfried, [[ASIN:B000X4O42I House, M.D.]]) and her desire to find her true father before her wedding. Stumbling upon her mother's diary, Sophie finds three candidates that might be her dad. Her mother Donna (Meryl Streep, [[ASIN:B000JSI7BM The Devil Wears Prada]]) has no idea that her daughter has invited three of her former loves to the wedding. And when they arrive, paternal sparks go a-flying, as do the flickers of old romances. Harry (Colin Firth) comes to the wedding out of fear that he'd done something and then left it undone (i.e., not properly fathering his daughter). Bill (Stellan Skarsgard, [[ASIN:B000U7WV1Y Pirates of the Caribbean - At World's End]]) comes simply because he's curious. But Sam (Pierce Brosnan, [[ASIN:B000J10KVE The Matador]]) arrives with a burning love-gone-by for Donna. And when Donna finds out all three of these old flames have arrived for the wedding, chaos ensues ...mixed with some toe-tapping music (Gah! Toe-tapping to ABBA!).<br /><br />The other element to the story are two old work friends of Donna's (they were a trio of singers at one time) who arrive for the wedding and find Donna in a frazzled state. Rosie (Julie Walters, [[ASIN:B000ZIZ0RU Becoming Jane]]) is the active and playful one with plenty of spunk, while Tanya (Christine Baranski) is the sexual over-achiever who has to fight off the advances of a few young island boys.<br /><br />Surprises abound as the movie winds down. One person comes out of the closet, while two others find love (even though one is running away from any possible commitment). Donna herself might find love in the arms of one of those old flames. And Sophie's wedding gets a change of venue.<br /><br />One of the final songs on the track (\\"Take a Chance on Me\\") is extremely funny and well thought-out. And as the credits roll, there's some laugh-out-loud moments as we get to watch Colin Firth try to dance in a skin-tight, sequined outfit (along with the other main players in the film).<br /><br />The final positive note for this movie has to be that the director Phyllida Lloyd was also responsible for MAMMA MIA's huge stage production success, and her translation of it from stage to silver screen was exceptionally well-rendered.

0670020745|1.0|I am writing this review for my father, who suffered his first major ischemic stroke in the right hemisphere of his brain in October, 1995.  More than one doctor told me they didn't understand how he'd survived that amount of damage, by all accounts he should have died.  But he didn't.  Since then, he's had two more, less major, ischemic strokes.<br /><br />He heard about this book and immediately purchased it.  He's always been interested in learning about how others have dealt with the devastating and debilitating aftermath often encountered following a stroke.<br /><br />He was fully unimpressed and completely disappointed with this book.  He had high hopes because the author is a well-educated brain scientist who, unfortunately, also suffered a stroke, albeit a different kind of stroke from my father because she had a hemorrhagic stroke.<br /><br />According to my father, this book seemed to focus more on her spirituality.  He also had the impression that she was, in some respects, almost touting stroke's praises...almost as if she was recommending having a stroke so that one could be closer with their spirituality.<br /><br />If you are looking for help dealing with your own stroke, or that of another, this is NOT the book to purchase.  If you do, you, too, will be disappointed in its lack of assistance.<br /><br />If you are looking for a guide to get closer to your own spiritualness, then this is a good one to read.
B000002GLV|2.0|I love Mayall and there's no question that he's put together some amazing bands.  Sadly, this album falls into the category of \\"almost made it\\".  The band doesn't come together, the solos are weak, especially if you compare these efforts to other jazz efforts of that era.  I prefer \\"Turning Point\\", hands down, for a live Mayall effort to fuse jazz, blues and folk.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I am a die-hard Jane Eyre fan, and Masterpiece Theatre definitely impressed me.  Toby Stephens captures Mr. Rochester's character perfectly, and Ruth Wilson carries out the challenging role of Jane Eyre with grace and naturality.  The only thing that I didn't like is that Jane and Mr. Rochester are much more physical than they are in the book, but it doesn't distract from the original story.  I would recommend this adaptation to anyone who has read the book!
0956010903|5.0|I'm actually quite pleased with this collection of Beedle the Bard's five fairy-tales and Dumbledore's corresponding comments.  True, the stories are not very long or detailed, but I didn't feel they should be, because they are supposed to be fairy-tales that wizarding families read to their children as we would read Cinderella or Snow White.  I thought the style was quite fitting (if a little gruesome on a few of the stories), and the art work is lovely!  It's delightful to think of Ron and his siblings hearing \\"Babbity Rabbity\\" before bed at the Burrow, or to think of Hermione translating the runes.  For those who have finished HP7, reading the final story, and Dumbledore's comments, will be especially interesting (even if not too informative) but interesting nonetheless, and any insight into Harry's world is more than welcomed!  One of my favorite parts is the footnotes, added by both Dumbledore and JK Rowling.  This, in addition to Dumbledore's insightful and amusing commentary, gives interesting clues to the Wizarding world - such as the difference between a Warlock and a Wizard, and just how Lucius Malfoy and Dumbeldore's long dislike for each other startd.  My favorite of the tales is the second, I think.  It was probably the happiest and most tame, but also had such a sweet message.  If you're a Harry Potter fan, I think you'll find this enjoyable on many levels, and for such a small book, there really is quite a lot packed inside.  Happy Reading!
B001KO3FFW|2.0|From early in the American Idol competition last season it was obvious that David Cook could sing and he always had an entertaining personal style to nearly every song he performed.    This would have been nice to carry over into his debut album... no such luck.  Rather then a creative, soul-filled exploration of David's talent, we get a tiresome collection of faux-inspired, rock-ballad-of-the-week tracks.  Even the last track, the 'have-to' selection that an Idol contest winner wrote seems \\"shoe-horned\\" into the album as a lame after-taste of David's highly anticipated debut.    I truely hope he is able to take more creative leaps once he gets a shot at a sophomore release, but it's obvious he'll need to distance himself from the bland American Idol production work first.

Also, this whole event is televised.<br />\\"Welcome to the Hunger Games; may the odds be ever in your favour.\\"<br />My Review: This book was very addictive and original. I could not stop reading it. The characters are fantastic and seemed like people that I could be friends with. Also I don't usually like dystopia, but it was great. I heard from so many people, that this book is amazing and it was. Every chapter ends with a cliffhanger that makes it so you have to continue reading. I also liked the fact that I could total picture this, by looking at current reality TV. In short, I highly recommend The Hunger Games and look forward to the second book.
031606792X|5.0|This the last of the Twilight saga it held me prisoner til i finished it.It wrapped the story up so well and omg would you believe she got her man?This is one reason the series of books have done so well she hung in there and got her man and nobody had to die to get to that.Isnt it nice that sometimes you can get what you want, what you fight for and so much more?
0930289234|5.0|This is an awesome book. It is one of those books that lives up to the hype. Believe all the great things you have heard about this comic. Read it before the movie comes out... Don't let your first taste of the Watchmen come second hand from Hollywood...
031606792X|2.0|ok. I read this book in 2 days, and needless to say. I was utterly disappointed. I wanted Bella and Jacob together! Ugh. this one left a bad taste in my mouth, just like the previous one (Eclipse). I felt dirty reading this book. I have no other way to explain it. Everything ended too cleanly. Would it have been too much to ask that the Volturi annilhilate (sp) Bella? b/c that's what I so badly wanted.
B001H5X7I4|5.0|This is a brilliant film, anchored by strong performances by Ben Stiller as fading action star Tugg Speedman, Jack Black as drug-addled comedy star Jeff Portnoy and especially the strong performance of Robert Downey Jr. as method actor Kirk Lazarus, who actually plays an African-American character named Sergeant Osiris, and stays in character even off set. They are filming the story of Four Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte) who is not all he seems to be, and is working with a special-effects pyrotechnics guy on the film based on Tayback's book, titled Tropic Thunder. The other two actors, rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) are playing different characters as well, but the group of actors gets more than they bargained for when they run into real-life drug runner Vietnamese thugs, led by a child. Speedman is captured by the thugs, which prompts the other actors to mount a rescue operation. Tom Cruise (who is essentially unrecognizable in prosthetic makeup) also co-stars as producer Les Grossman, in a hilarious star turn, as well as Matthew McConaughey as Speedman's agent Rick \\"Pecker\\" Peck. This is a hilarious \\"movie-within-a-movie\\" which really scores on all fronts. 5 Stars!!!!!!

He is unable to.<br />After being inside for a couple months with his sister, Gretel, he decides to explore the fence and visit his \\"neighbors\\". He befriends a boy born on his birthday, Shmuel. He visits him everyday and they become friends.<br />My Review: I found this book very interesting, because I love history and the many different voices available to us. I have never read a book about the Holocaust in which the person didn't know what happening and John Boyne wrote that only a young child would work for it. So, you could see a child's view of evil. This book will ache at your heart. It is pretty deep reading, I would say if you can read Anne Frank's diary or Night. Then this book will not be too much for you. John Boyne does an amazing job.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|Not much into country but this one touched me.I heard Love Story and thats all it took.White Horse is great sad but you feel her emotion.So glad i bought this cd.
B000001FYL|5.0|I've been a Bon Jovi fan since 1986 I think, but when I heard this album I was just blown away. This is not only my favorite Jon Bon Jovi album, but one of my all time favorites.  I know Jon was inspired by the film in the first place but he just went so beyond that.  I was living in the States when this songs became the soundtrack of everything that was going on with my life back then. The lyrics are very deep and can be applied to many situations in life, not just old western movies.  Jon's singing is also one of the highest in his career, and you know he has very high standards.  Each and every song on this record is so relevant and well written, it is just unbelievable that all of them fit so well in a whole package.  Billy get your guns is a rocker that puts you in the right mood to listen to Miracle, I felt Jon captured a latin feel with this one, something that was not really expected. Blaze Of Glory, what else can be said? if you can't be touched by this one, you are probably dead already, The guitar solo is so perfect, Jeff Beck did an amazing job on this one (and the rest of the songs too), I mean, I love Richie Sambora, but he cannot top this solo on his performances with the band, Beck is a master and every note he plays goes so perfect with the song, he captured exactly what Jon was talking about. I think a lot of people over look the great contributions that the artists that played on this record did to the production.  I mean, Jeff Beck's work on this one is huge, his tone and style make every song reach a whole new level, I love Beck's solo work, but when his great guitar talent is mixed with Jon Bon Jovi's singin and songwriting, it fires up a real magic that will last forever.   Blood money is a certain choice to play when you feel alone sitting on a mountain or something like that, it is a beautiful song and the lyrics are so powerful.  Santa Fe, I think words can't say enough about how I feel when I listen to this song, I think this is one of thegreatest songs ever written, and that is a lot!!  The lyrics are profound, meaninful and touching, and the melody, the singing, the arrangements, everything is just perfect on this song.  I think Jon Bon Jovi will never be able to top this one because it just can't be better, there are just a few songs that you can say that have all the parts fitting perfectly, emotion, performance, lyrics, everything. I just can say no more about how great this song is.    Justice in a barrel is one of my favorites too, watch out that Jeff Beck solo, it starts on acoustic guitar and then goes electric with his classic tone, I just can't get enough of this.  To sum it up this is a record that you never get tired to listen too, and when you listen to it carefully it gets inside your feelings like no other. It is a shame that even Jon Bon Jovi seems to have forgotten this record, well, he's done some amazing job after this, but he hasn't achieved this level of greatness.  There is a time in every songwriter's life that the light of music touches him or her very deep and achieves music heaven, I think Jon really did it with this one, it is too bad that this light don't shine the same way twice.
0375826726|5.0|Thsi was by far the best of the series so far.  I am totally amazed that there are some readers who haven't given it 5 stars.  I read it in about 3 days.  When I had finished reading it, I actually picked it back up and read most of it again.  It was that good!
B001A3AA0G|3.0|So I was very excited to get this album.  Previewing the tracks and reading all the great reviews it had to be a winner. But after listening through the album only a couple times I'm already tired of it.  I have to say they did a great job but it's an album that you listen to every once in a while for me.
B0018OAPAW|3.0|Good CD. Sound more like the original/classic Offspring, which I personally like better (though Conspiracy of One was good). The CD is upbeat-nothing slow or melodramatic.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|Ok we all have off days our thoughts jumbled you know a yuck moment.Here was mine,I liked everyone that was in the movie but yuck.I have tried to get threw this movie twice and I just can not do it.I would have been better off if I bought the commercials.So this was my moment of shame when I purchased this movie,I will have to live with the shame lol.
B001CD3PLU|1.0|I am very shocked at this release because of the picture quality. As every goonie fan should know that has seen this movie a hundred times like I have knows that this movie is shot mostly in dimlit areas such as  the hide out and the caverns, so you will not really see very much jawdropping detail. Now as far as the beginning where you see the prison scene, there you will get some detail but here is the big problem....after the prison scene it starts getting dark \\"flickering\\" effects around the sides of the picture due to \\"I guess\\" (DVD defect). maybe I got a bad disc but it could possibly be a defect in all but I will return the disc and let you guys know as soon as I get a new one. But this is NOT one to own for a Blu Ray collection being the Standard DVD version looks the same. I am a huge goonies fan and this was a BIG letdown for me. If you still prefer to buy this anyway, go to Amazon.Co.uk. you get a better deal for this Blu Ray there because Amazon.co.uk ships it to the USA and this version on here is a UK version as well I believe and thats why its so expensive being its an import but I got it on the UK site for around 20.00 us Dollars
B000NA28I4|3.0|This would be a fine movie if I had never read the book.  The movie took away some of the most important elements and details of the book (such as Arya not even being an elf in the movie, and the obvious lack of dwarves.)  An Eragon movie created in the style of the book series has so much potential that was lost in this cinematic effort.<br /><br />In defense of the movie, my husband and son loved it because they had never read the original story.  (They have both recently listened to Eragon on Cd and now refuse to watch the movie ever again.)<br /><br />In summary, read the book or watch the movie.  Don't do both!
184195392X|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  Yann Martel makes us realize how animalistic humans can be in the most enjoyable way possible.
1596434252|5.0|Not suitable for children under 2 years old because the pages are beautifully developed and might tear in their hands, but this is a really cool book for learning the alphabet and seeing the ways in which letters are constructed and tied together. Very neat to look at!
1401219268|3.0|\\"Watchmen\\" was originally published as a limited series of 12 comics in the mid-1980's and these 12 comics are reprinted together in this one book. It is considered by many to be the \\"greatest\\" graphic novel of all time, but I personally did not care for it.<br /><br />The main thing that I did not like about \\"Watchmen\\" is that it takes to long to get to the \\"main story\\". The first half of the story is primarily composed of the histories of many of the main characters (each of these earlier stories is structured in a very similar style to an average episode of \\"Lost\\" and it is not surprising that one of the recommendations on the back cover of my copy of \\"Watchmen\\" comes from one of the co-creators of \\"Lost\\"). After that, much of the next quarter deals with the personal relationships between the superheroes. It is only in the final quarter that the main story really comes to the fore. I understand that one of the reasons why many people consider this to be a great novel is because it does deal with the histories and personal lives of these characters, but I personally felt that they were overdone. Nine comics of this sort of material was just too much for me.<br /><br />When the main story, about a conspiracy to bring about a major disaster (which I won't go into details about, so as not to spoil it), does come to the fore, however, the story improves greatly. I really enjoyed the final three comics. I thought they were exciting and original and I liked many of the issues raised by the motives of the story's \\"villain\\", except I found the very end of the story to be disappointing (I felt that there should have been more) and had I been buying this novel one issue per month, I probably would have given up long before I got to that point.<br /><br />Overall, I agree with all of the other reviewers who state that this is not your average, run-of-the-mill comic book. However, if you are thinking of buying this, keep in mind that because of that fact, it might not be foryou.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|I don't think I'll ever get tired of heist pictures, and if the heist picture also turns out to be a period piece, then my fan joy cup doth runneth over, brother! THE BANK JOB serves up grand larceny and its nasty aftermath. The film re-enacts the daring \\"true-to-life\\" robbery which went down in 1971, on Baker Street, East London. Back in the day, the Lloyds Bank heist made very big noise in British media, for a bit of time anyway, until the British authorities issued a D-Notice which effectively gagged the press. But it's cool, because now the whole dirty laundry can be aired out, merely by watching this movie. Because movies absolutely never lie.<br /><br />What's in Safety Deposit Box #118? Why, the McGuffin, of course, in the form of explicit photos featuring a British royal princess caught engaged in the naughty. Now this isn't much of a spoiler as the film spells this out early on; that's what all those opening scenes of salacious frolic were all about. And these photos, locked away in Box #118 at Lloyds Bank, are presently owned by a civil rights activist, who's actually more notoriously identified as a \\"slum landlord, a drug dealer, and a vicious pimp,\\" if I'm quoting the film correctly. British Intelligence is aware of what's in Box #118, and it prevents them from hauling this local kingpin to the gallows (or whatever it is they did to blackhearted miscreants back in the day). Okay, so the dilemma for MI-5 (or MI-6, I don't think the film clarifies) is how to obtain these photos without causing a scandal? How about getting some villains to rob the bank, specifically the vault which holds the safety deposit boxes? Of course, the villains must never, never know about Box #118.<br /><br />Enter Terry Leather (Jason Statham), a modest car lot owner with mischief in his past and currently owing the local loanshark, except that he's late with the dues. So he gets a visit from a duo of shakedown bullies. On a less painful note, Terry also gets a visit from lovely Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), a femme fatale type who Terry has known for years. Martine has a proposition for him and his shifty mates. And, yes, it concerns a bank job. So off they go, with the recruiting, and the scheming, and the execution of the thing, and the funny bits with the walkie-talkies. But Terry's a clever sort. He soon sniffs out that there's much more going on than a simple robbery. But when he and his chums realize how deep they're in it, well, after all, they're only small-time hoods... What chance have they got, going up against vicious thugs, crooked cops, and implacable government spooks? Oh, and a smut king?<br /><br />Part of the charm is that these small-time hoods are mostly regular blue-collar dudes, of similar stock that produced them blokes what done THE FULL MONTY. Even the film title doesn't put on airs, getting right to the crux as it does. It's easy to root for these guys. Jason Statham, the leader of the pack, has always had screen presence and again brings his steel-wool stubble, balding dome and rugged quality to the role. That, this time, he also has a wife and two kids whom he obviously adores grounds him as a character and makes you root for him all the more. I like that Terry Leather isn't a mastermind, who's got every angle covered. When the crapcake comes down, he fails to save everyone. Terry has native street smarts, and this helps him out of several jams. But he also becomes the beneficiary of great good luck and outside circumstances.<br /><br />I don't think THE BANK JOB rates as an instant classic, but it's a very good movie, and one I'll most definitely catch up with again. Taut, gritty storytelling presents us with several close scrapes and also moments which don't at all go our villains' way. The tension is ratcheted up in the second half of the movie, as we begin to see the brutal fallout of the heist. There's no doubting that THE BANK JOB, in a vicious-fist-to-the-gut sort of way, is more suspenseful than, say,those breezy Ocean capers. Here, the stakes feel more real, because the people feel more real. I also quite like the film's closing caption: \\"The names of many of the people identified in this film have been changed to protect the guilty.\\" I wonder what really went down that time at Lloyds Bank, back in 1971. I guess, now and then, even the high muck-a-mucks deserve to engage in a bit of chickee-wang-wang... but, tsk tsk, those crazy royals...those breezy Ocean capers.

1405706333|5.0|It's a bit expensive, especially for legal aid practitioners and pro bono advisers but, like a good meal, well worth the investment! Michael Cook continues to enjoy excellent reviews for an excellent book which is the foremost publication on civil costs currently available.  I have reviewed previous editions of this work but, with the arrival of each annual edition, I continue to marvel at the additional content which, as Cook says, has doubled in size since the first edition appeared in 1991.  It is now about 700 pages long with 42 detailed chapters split into six parts.<br /><br />As always, \\"Cook on Costs\\" explains, as well as details, every aspect of the remuneration of solicitors and barristers.  It remains the foremost practical guide over the complexities of all aspects of the costs of contentious and non-contentious legal business.  No practitioner who needs to understand the principles and practice of legal costs should be without a copy of the current work each year.<br /><br />Whilst Michael Cook is a most entertaining speaker at seminars, he has transferred his infectious enthusiasm to this book.  The outcome is an authoritative and highly readable work which makes a change from some nameless publications which make the issue of cost a dire subject at the best of times.<br /><br />The publication remains both thorough and comprehensive, answering all the main questions which frequently occur.  It covers the entitlement to and the quantification of contentious and non-contentious litigation.  Also, it covers the relationship between solicitor and client with a new section on the abolition of Conditional Fee Agreement Regulations in August 2005.<br /><br />It is very up to date with the latest decided cases, many of which have not been reported and can only be obtained from the courts websites.  There are verbatim extracts from leading test cases together with all the relevant statutes, rules and regulations governing civil costs.<br /><br />For those practitioners who are new to `Cook on Costs', do have a trip around the various parts which cover the following six headings: solicitor and client; between the parties; quantification; sanctions and penalties; particular people; and funding.<br /><br />Probably the biggest factors which have always persuaded me to go for `Cook on Costs' are the special methods of expression which Michael Cook uses, with good natured and, sometimes ironic, humour, to describe what is such a dull subject to many, especially law students if you have to teach it to them.  There always seems to be an almost inaudible groan in court when my learned friend gets up to address the judge on costs.  Cook always makes the subject much more exciting.  The other two great plus factors for me are the excellent coverage of the Civil Procedure Rules and Practice Directions with attendant case law, and his final part on `funding' which covers the Community Legal Service and Conditional Fees and is so well explained.<br /><br />At the end of this review, I looked at the original preface to the first edition, and read a phrase of what Cook's late partner, Lionel Cranfield, used to say at the end of some heavy litigation: \\"Now we come to the interesting part - the costs!\\"... which is actually what the client is normally desperate about?  This book is about the interesting part and written in an interesting way which I find pleasantly manageable.<br /><br />In the first edition in 1991, Cook wrote that `money is the life-blood of a solicitor's practice' and he continues by saying that he remains `perplexed that, in spite of this realisation, most solicitors and their clients lose out financially because of the profession's basic lack of understanding and interest in all aspects of costs'.<br /><br />It is sad to report that not much has changed (except CPR which is a `God-send') fifteen years on.  Let us hope that the government's reforming zeal over legal services with the Legal Services Bill currently before Parliament addresses Michael Cook's original concerns with more vigour than the New Labour approach so far on sentencing or extradition treaties.more vigour than the New Labour approach so far on sentencing or extradition treaties.
B00007K02F|2.0|The film was very pretty, and a more accurate adaptation that I've seen previously, but, unfortunately, it lacks a key part of the book: passion. There is absolutely no tension between Jane and Rochester in this version, though from a technical standpoint they both play the parts decently. I love the book, have read it multiple times, but by the end of this film I didn't really care whether they got back together or not, so lacking in passion and tension it was.
0307265730|3.0|This book has multiple stories and each deals with different stages of Desi's life interwined with their American Born Confused Desis(ABCD) or American lived Confused Desis (ALCD) life.    The story \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" deals with the life of an Old Indian man who is settled in America and tries to be live a single independant American life where as his ABCD daughter wants him to be with her as a typical indian culture.    Then the most notable story deals with the rude awakening of the fact that even ABCD's can become drunkards, throw their life over alcohol.    \\"Kaushik and Me\\" is a great stroy told from the narrator's point of view regarding the adjustment of life of 2 teenagers who cross each other's life for a brief moment and meet later only to have their heart broken.    The book through stories discusses how Desi's try to assimilate and lose their values( drugs, alcohol and Sex).     Overall a rude awakening to the desis of America.

B000050HTO|1.0|Why oh why is this clown considered a poet? REAL poets are Lil' Wayne, Britney Spears, Nickelback, Staind or 50 Cent. I bet ol' Bob couldn't write poetry like \\"I sit alone and watch the clock/Trying to collect my thoughts/All I think about is you\\". See that poetry? It's \\"Believe\\" by Staind. And why doesn't this Dylan folk have any lyrics about clubs and booty-shakin'? What an old-timer. Tell him to get with the times or he's never going to get any BET airplay.
6304779356|4.0|As an adult I love this flick. I purchased it for my 8 year old son so we could watch it during the Halloween Holiday. He did not watch it but I think that it would have been ok for him. I know that the movie is rated \\"R\\", but I think today it would have been PG-13. There is not sexual imagery, just a little kissing, or vulgarity. There is a little blood and gore but it is very cheesy and the Frog brothers keep the mood light with funny comments.

B001EO2UJK|1.0|Nick Davis has done amazing work in the past. Actually, ALL of his work up until these Genesis remixes was excellent! Has he lost his touch? Why do these Genesis sets sound so harsh? I wonder what Nick's reasoning for this is? Does he even realize this work is much worse than what he's capable of? He's a world class engineer so why did he make so many newbie mistakes with these Genesis remixes? Too much EQ? Really? That's what interns do when they're learning how to mix.     It's not the compression that makes these remixes bad, it's all the console EQ that was added that makes them sound shrill and hollow. Lots of top and bottom end boosting going on. I know that sound well from my early days of learning how to mix (on this same SSL console I might add). I was trying to make everything as punchy and aggressive as I could and my mixes came out sounding just like these Genesis remixes. When you have that much EQ on EVERYTHING things are going to sound a bit off.     Those SSL EQs have a very distinct sound to them, so do the compressors on the channel strips. Nick Davis just wanted these things to jump out at you and in the process he over-did everything. I think he was simply trying too hard to impress everyone with brute force and not sound quality. If you dig it, good for you. I can heard the EQs ringing and that really bothers me but the lack of good midrange and the shrill top end make my ears shut down.
B001G5ZKZS|1.0|What an awful band. After this, I want to \\"Rush\\" to the nearest toilet and barf! LOL! That Geddy Li guy sounds like he's been sucking on way too many helium balloons, he sounds like a chipmunk! The drummer, Neil Pearl or something, is horrible. He only plays in 4/4 rhythm! He should take a cue or two from Lars Ulrich from the St. Anger album. Not to mention the lame guitar work and inaudible bass. Skip this generic classic rock junk and stick with the masters like Britney Spears.

B0019FOC5E|3.0|I loved the music for Mamma Mia, but unfortunatly this soundtrack is incomplete. It has all of the songs minus three:  'Chiquitita'  'I Do, I Do, I Do'  & 'Waterloo'  With the addition of these three songs I would give this soundtrack five stars, but unfortunatly poeple like me who care about this sort of thing will have to wait for them to release a 'Complete' soundtrack to get all of the songs.
B00192IOBA|5.0|To the guy that gave this one star and called it \\"homorific\\".......shame on you.  You should have let your \\"better half\\" rate it.  Seriously......what do you listen to?  Metal?  Figures.    This is one of the most thought provoking, emotional albums I have heard in a long time.  It is a work of art.  Bravo.....I had never heard of Jason Mraz until this album.  He is simply fantastic..a true artist.    This will not be my last Jason Mraz album.  I am very impressed with his work.  I would give him 10 stars if I could.  He has sooooo outdone many greater-known singers.  I know that I will be singing his praises for some time to come.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Great film,very well polished.Excellent casting,fantastic performances. This was more than a superhero movie,it was like a crime drama,a Noir with Batman.The late Heath Ledger was brilliant as the Joker. I loved Aaron Eckhart as 2 Face. this was just an incredible movie. Full of explosions, violence, basically things action films are made of, but the acting of the characters was strong & the story was well done so it was above the put your brain aside and just watch. This is a dark movie,to me a superhero film noir. Worth watching over and over to catch up on scenes are see what you missed last time. Very fast paced movie. The sound did get haywire with the explosions and I also had to keep adjusting the volume because the volume kept changing, mostly during the music and explosions the sound would just EXPLODE to a higher volume,.Not only was this a great Superhero movie,but just a great non stop film in general.Tons of explosions,bombs, and terrorism which to me is unfortunate as we do see a lot of this in real life<br />As for who was the better joker, Nicholson or Ledger, well both were equally as crazy, well maybe Health more. I think that both were really outstanding in their time periods. Jack was a great Joker for 1989 and Health was great for 2008.<br />I like Christian Bale as Batman/Bruce Wayne although Batman sounds like Clint Eastwood with his graveled up voice...
B001DELX08|3.0|This otherwise excellent production was annoyingly flawed by out of balance sound. The orchestra would often drown out the singing. I like to listen with the sound a bit loud. If I set the sound volume to get the singing where I wanted it at a loud part, the orchestra would at times be deafeningly loud and force the turning down of the volume. So I was forced to watch the performance with the sound turned down so far that the singing seemed like it was recorded with the microphone too far away from the singer. Sad. If they ever fix this, they also ought to reduce the loudness of the applause.
B0000009NN|2.0|I try to be open-minded when it comes to 70's music, because there was so many creative artists back then doing radically different things and breaking new ground (many times not even REALIZING they were) that I can't help but admire the influence and impact these musicians made (including David Bowie).    But for whatever reason, David Bowie's Young Americans never clicked for me.  I just don't like the direction Bowie took his music for this one (thankfully) album.      The title song is good, and I've come around to really like \\"Win\\", but nothing else clicks.  Even \\"Fame\\" doesn't seem all that great, even though my dog used to howl at that song all the time, so I have memories of the song.      It's like David Bowie had a lot of trouble writing a consistent song for this album, because many of these songs start out good, but gradually get on my nerves because of awkward sudden musical changes that come out of nowhere.  I don't know what David Bowie was thinking with those odd changes, but they don't work for me.      I just can't appreciate this one I'm afraid, but hey, I still love Bowie's music.      If you happen to be in the same boat as I am with this album and haven't heard much Bowie, don't sweat it- his desire to be as experimental as humanly possible took him FAR away from this albums style by the time the next album was released.
B000UDMULE|3.0|I was disappointed in this album, but then (1) the only Alison Krauss music I had was the \\"Raising Sand\\" album she made with Robert Plant, and I know now that this isn't at all representative of her work; and (2) all I did was read a few of the most helpful reviews.  Since good reviews are generally said to be \\"helpful\\" by fans who are likely to (or already know they do) like the music, this isn't too smart, I guess.  If you aren't very familiar with the artist, you really want to know the possible downside of an album.  Thus you need to look at those reviewers who didn't like it much, and see if any of the criticisms \\"strike a chord\\" with you.    I certainly agree with the reviewers who have complained of the crowd noise (and the length of it) on the album.  Sure, you do expect some of that on a live album, but I felt this was excessive.  One track's actual song ends with 1:40 left on the track, and others end with 0:30 or more remaining!  This is completely wasted time before getting to the next song, and very irritating.    That said, my main complaint is this: if you want to hear Allison Krauss sing, be warned that you will only hear her on 16 of these 25 tracks!  The others feature the band or guest artists, meaning instrumentals or male vocals.  This is perhaps to be expected in a concert, but was again disappointing to me.      In summary, if you're familiar with and like the kind of music Alison and Union Station make, and especially if you dig concert CDs, you will probably enjoy this album.  However, I personally would be hesitant to purchase the album knowing what I know now.  I would be more likely to get a studio album, especially one that I knew featured Alison on almost all the tracks.
B00154GEFU|5.0|I've been listening to ASIA and offshoots of ASIA since the original Heat of the Moment.  I've been a fan of the old and the new ASIA, but certainly have my favorite albums.  In all honesty, Phoenix is my very favorite album by ASIA.  Yes, the musicians are getting older.  But the music of Phoenix has a special, melodic quality that exceeds any of their previous works in my opinion.  It is emotional and powerful.  Most of the songs are ballads, or at least more mellow than in the past.  You can hear the roots of predecessor bands - especially Steve Howe who resembles the Steve Howe from YES.  But as far as a reunion album goes by a bunch of old greats, this album is exceptional.  If you are looking for emotionally charged music that pricks the soul and elevates the conscience, this is the album.

B001GZ6QBU|4.0|In the hands of the director, Christopher Nolan, THE DARK KNIGHT works extremely well    Our super-hero is not super clean.  Great.      Much talk about Heath Ledger, and he was great, but really, all of the actors were wonderful.     Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart, Michael Caine, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, Eric Roberts and the rest of the cast add to the final tally, which is a very entertaining movie    The story, the production design, the score, the stunts and special effects are also great too.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a great sharpener it makes knives super sharp but not quite razor sharp it is much better than Smith's Abrasives 2 Step Knife Sharpener, that sharpener gets knives just as sharp as it has the same angles to the ceramic part of the sharpener; but that uses rods which get loose and end up rolling as you draw your knife through it and don't sharpen your knife. Also this is easier to get a blade into the ceramic sharpening part. This also includes a serrated knife sharpener, and this works well but i can't say much for it as it is the first serrated knife sharpener i have ever used.    i recommend pulling the blade through the carbide part 10 times using semi heavy to medium force, the using the ceramic part about 10 times using medium force then lighting up to about as light as you can get by the 10th stroke  skip the carbide part if your knife is already adequately sharp, only use the carbide part if your knife i dull or damaged as it takes off a lot of steel

1592289444|5.0|This is quite simply one of the best books I've ever read. Brilliantly written with a sharp eye toward emotion and detail. A gripping and touching tale. I laughed, I cried....    I've seen the stuff about it not being true and I just don't believe it. The evidence against it is flimsy, but more to the point is that if it is a fabrication then the author - or the author's landlord whom he dictated it to - missed his calling as a writer. He surely would have made a fortune if he'd written 20 more like it. The imagination it would have taken to come up with such a gripping tale, the virtuosity of the writer in putting emotion and detail on the page would rank him with the great writers of our time.    I recently read another book by a Jewish psychologist named Victor Frankl entitled \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\". It's a concentration camp memoir coupled with a psychological technique \\"logotherapy\\" that he created out of his experiences. Early on in his imprisonment he got together with some other imprisoned medical professionals and their conclusion was \\"everything they taught us in school was wrong\\". A man can't live through this, a man can't live through that. But the Nazis did this, that and the other to him and he survived. Rawicz didn't go through anything worse than Frankl went through.    I've seen other so called \\"inconsistencies\\" that are almost laughable. One was that handcuffs and chains were Czarist so the Soviets would have never used them. Stalin killed 10s of millions of people and brutalized 10s of millions more - are we really to believe he had an aversion to chains? Then there's the whole Yeti nonsense. I don't know what Rawicz saw up there, but a better argument against his story is that the Yeti was the craziest thing he saw on this journey - people who go through a lot less report seeing aliens, purple elephants, Abraham Lincoln, etc. etc. etc. To hang your argument on something like that is ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that the incident filledall of one page in the book.

B001DTPZNY|5.0|I have no idea why there are so many cranky reviews of this movie. It was great good rip-roaring fun! It was full of humor, fast action, and all of the other outrageous goodies you'd expect from an Indiana Jones film. Ignore all those other crabby apples and just enjoy the wild ride!
B0009HLD0K|5.0|Despite the fact that my husband went to graduate school in Bloomington, Indiana where BREAKING AWAY was filmed I had never seen it until this evening.  Until actually watching it I thought it was just about bicycle racing and it never interested me. Though the films offers some great scenes of bikes racing through the lovely Southern Indiana countryside as well as footage from IU's fabled Little 500, important coming of age themes are also addressed in a humorous and not unrealistic way.    The movie centers on four young \\"townies\\" Mooch, Mike, Cyril and Dave who are one year out of high school but still aimlessly hanging out around town and filled with jealousy of the more privileged IU students who derisively refer to them as cutters.  Apparently in Bloomington the traditional name for townies was stoners because many of the natives made their living cutting limestone in the surrounding quarries.  For purposes of the film the nickname was changed to cutters since the term stoners is now readily associated with drug use.  Dave, is the main protagonist of the movie and he is a young man with a rather goofy infatuation with all things Italian and especially Italian bicycle racing. Dave is the despair of his father who makes his living selling questionable used cars to the college kids and Dave's mom and dad supply many humorous moments to the movie.  Through the course of the film Dave and his friends \\"come of age\\" through competing in a bike race with the college kids and the movie is really much better than it sounds.  BREAKING AWAY is quite family friendly and is a great choice to watch with tweens or teenagers.
B000002H4C|4.0|The soundtrack to the 1981 animated film is an excellent example of the merging of two pop culture genres that was prevalent during this era. And the wide range of musical styles is an outstanding cross-section of this \\"Golden Era\\" for FM rock-orientated radio.<br /><br />There are arena tour mainstays like Black Sabbath (The Mob Rules), Blue Oyster Cult (Veteran of the Psychic Wars), Grand Funk Railroad (Queen Bee), Journey (Open Arms) and Nazareth (Crazy {A Suitable Case for Treatment}), along with members of super groups (Donald Fagen, Don Felder, Stevie Nicks) showing some style on their own.<br /><br />Cheap Trick (Reach Out, I Must Be Dreamin') is at the height of its radio playlist power, while Riggs, Trust and the quirky Devo add some spice to the mix. Sammy Hagar provides a solid punch with the title track.<br /><br />The heavy metal on here is platinum, as the performances are as good as it gets from these artists.
B00003L2I0|5.0|Playing this CD almost makes me cry. This guy had to change his name for commercial reasons, was given silly clothes to wear and a more than a little ludicrous haircut, all for the sake of launching another 'eccentric singer'. Well, it payed off. The records sold very well. But who saw through the mask put on by the record company? Did anyone notice what incredible songwriting talent this guy had? Very few.  Later in his life, he became big in Japan. Without the clothes and the haircut. And does he look eccentric on the cover of this CD? Hail to the superior musical taste of the Japanese.
0765342294|4.0|'Ender's Game' was written by Orson Scott Card and first published in 1977. It has won both the Nebula and Hugo Award for Science fiction novels.<br /><br />I picked up this book after some discussion with another amazon friend who was a great fan of this series (now at 6 books, I believe). This recommendation turn out to be a good piece of advice as I enjoyed reading this work.<br /><br />The tale was well thought out and superbly written; the story itself was intriguing, with enough action and interesting events to make you eager to get back to this book whenever you could.<br /><br />The Story...*SPOILER*<br /><br />This is the tale of Ender Wiggin, who we meet as a six year old boy.  We then follow Ender through the next five years of his ongoing training and development; development that the authorities of the day hope will lead them find the next military leader they need to save the world from an alien invasion.<br /><br />One Concern...*SPOILER*<br /><br />The one negative I'd have (and loss of 1/2 Star) would deal with the aspect of believability (or lack thereof). Somehow taking a six year old boy (despite his high aptitude for the job) and training him to take over an intergalactic space armada seems a little (well, a lot) preposterous. Replacing the six year old with someone a bit older, would have added some credibility to this otherwise excellent story.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Although toted to be 'Young-Adult', this book will appeal to any sci-fi fan because it is both well written and superbly presented. Maybe the believability factor could have been enhanced somewhat  with an slightly older protagonist. 4 1/2 Stars.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
0375842209|5.0|I could not put this book down; although it took me awhile to get use to the way Mr. Zusak wrote in the 3rd person.

B00168OINK|5.0|(disclaimer: if you are considering the Blu-Ray disc, you should know that it does not contain the \\"Secrets of the Furious Five\\" extra feature that is available with some DVD versions of this movie)<br />I loved this film in the theater, and I decided to buy the Blu-ray version simply for its color and detail.  At 1080p, the picture is ornate, vivid, and eye-popping.<br />I've also been very pleased with the sound quality of this disc.  I'm no golden-ear, but I can tell you that my Onkyo TX-SR806 receiver offered me a sizeable variety of options as far as the audio: I believe some of the lossless audio options my receiver picked up on are unique to the Blu-Ray version.  The end result of all this technology is that the movie both looks and sounds amazing--more amazing, in my opinion, than it was in our local theater.<br />Kung-Fu Panda is a hilarious, enjoyable family film that does an excellent job of capturing the excitement of martial arts while downplaying the violence of what is ultimately a battle story.  The beauty of this film is that while it borrows from many movie cliches, it also embeds a rather good message about not trying to be who you think people expect you to be--but simply making the best of who you are. There's an undercurrent of believing in yourself that warms the heart as much as the gentle humor that plays throughout.  Voiced by Jack Black (as Po the Panda), Dustin Hoffman (as his trainer Master Sifu) and a celebrity supporting cast, the chemistry comes together and makes Kung-Fu Panda a fun film that stands up to repeat viewings.  Highly recommended.

B00122PV3Q|5.0|The first time I heard this Record I was thirteen. I unwrapped it on Christmas and the second the needle hit the vinyl I was blown away. From then on the doors have been my favorite band and this \\"40th Anniversary Mix\\" is just outstanding. I wish more people would get a clue to how great the doors were, and still are. After 40 years, Morrison's power still resonates through the mind and, if you let him, opens  up the doors of perception. I wish people would step out of their brainwashed minds (assimilated to like rap, because that's all that commercials play and record companies promote) and give the doors a chance. With songs like \\"lamerica\\" and \\"the changeling\\" to the complete classics \\"L.A. Woman\\" and \\"Riders on the storm\\", how could one not love the doors return to the blues?
B001EYGOG0|2.0|I really admire Tony Bennett, and I love Count Basie; their albums together, though not the equal of Basie's work with Sinatra, are outstanding...but the engineering/production on this disc is very flat. It reduces the sound of the Basie band to a quasi-karaoke background (it sounds more like a trio than a band); there's no 'richness' in the playing. Since Bennett's voice is understandably thin at this point in his career, the result is a washed-out sound that sounds more like a demo than a finished product. The swinging work sounds better than the ballads, but there needed to be sweetening of both the bass and perhaps the judicious introduction of strings to give this some depth. I don't think this will get a lot of playtime at our house.

B0000C0FJB|1.0|I have been a Rush fan for many years and finally decided to purchase Rush In Rio as I wanted a live CD from Rush.  This is a horrible recording.  The music sounds muddy and vocals get lost. I myself,as others have suggested tried it on different stereos thinking that was the problem but that's not it.  I have several other live albums by other bands that were very good.  Thin Lizzy Live and Dangerous, Jethro Tull Bursting Out, Fleetwood Mac Live to name a few all were good recordings but you can still tell they were live recordings.  This one blows.
B00069YDXU|5.0|I have read a lot of the reviews concerning the ELP performance at montreaux.All the bad reviews kept me from buying the dvd,but as time went by, the good reviews started to show up, so I said to myself, why don´t go ahead and take the risk? so I did, and you know what, I loved the performance. I don´t care if Emerson doesn´t shave his arms or if Carl Palmer took off his T-shirt, anyway he has been doing that all through his Asia career. It´s an excellent concert, go ahead and buy it, the guys still rock, the selection of songs are different from recent performances. I have the live at the royal albert hall, and that´s a good concert too, but I prefer this one. I have a home theater system, and it gives the impression that I am at the concert, also Keith Emerson´s selection of sounds or in other words the presets, are superb. Greg lake plays a very inspirational bass guitar as well as acoustic guitar. Carl palmer still shows the speed that has caracterized his drumming.So amazon friends I recommend this concert you won´t be dissapointed!
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|AC/DC is the best rock band ever. In my opinion, Back in Black is one of the CD's that define AC/DC, along with Highway to Hell (which I also own and is also a great CD).  The documentary entitled \\"The Story of Back in Black\\" on the video side of this DualDisc is really cool. The advertised length is 30 minutes, though I have not checked this and if the advertised length was wrong I would still recommend this. It has interviews from the current band (Brian Johnson, Angus Young, Malcolm Young, Cliff Williams, and Phil Rudd) and the engineer (Tony Platt).  The video side also has \\"the entire album in superior sound,\\" as it says on the CD case. It also has a discography.  The only problem is when I tried to load the CD side on my computer. There were some songs in which the time appeared in a really weird number and it would not play the song. Luckily, I already had a regular copy of Back in Black that I ended up keeping on my computer.  To any AC/DC fan I recommend this. I also recommend this to anyone who isn't an AC/DC fan, though I would recommend getting a CD of theirs like Highway to Hell to make sure you enjoy their music before paying $20 for a DualDisc Back in Black.   Rock on, AC/DC!

B001GCUNVW|4.0|\\"The Wrestler\\" is wise and heartbreaking in its examination of resilient life patterns. It tells the simple but deep story of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), an aging professional wrestler who doesn't seem to care that he's past his prime. Or maybe he cares so much that he clings to a former life, one he can never get back no matter how hard he tries. Whatever the case, all Randy knows is that he belongs in a wrestling ring. What a fascinating film, so masterful in its character development, so beautiful in its structural and visual simplicity, so sad in its assertion that old habits die hard. It's a wonderful turn for director Darren Aronofsky, who left me hopelessly confused with his nonsensical previous film, \\"The Fountain;\\" instead of an incomprehensible plot buried under mounds of visual effects, he gives us a real story with characters we can actually care about.    What's most interesting about this movie is the attention paid to smaller details, such as the surprising amount of time a wrestler spends maintaining his image. Never mind the weightlifting and the steroid use--trips to tanning and hair salons are part of the regiment, as is the shaving of body hair. Randy does all of this, yet we know he's doing it out of desperation than out of vanity. I'm reminded of \\"Bigger, Stronger, Faster*: *The Side Effects of Being American,\\" a 2008 documentary that examined steroid use among professional athletes. As director Christopher Bell tells us, Americans are obsessed with heroes, and as such, heroes must always be victorious. But what if victory depends on creating a façade, one that impressionable viewers are unable to look behind? There's a scene in \\"The Wrestler\\" when, just before a match, Randy hides a broken razor blade within the tape around his wrist; when his opponent slams him to the ground, he discretely removes the blade and cuts his forehead, making it look like the match has been rough on him. The phoniness of that moment is second only tothe knowledge that the matches are scripted, along with the rivalries between the wrestlers.    The problems stem from the fact that Randy isn't acknowledging the stress his aging body is under. It mostly has to do with his heart, which threatens to give out after an especially shocking wrestling match, one that involved barbed wire, staples, and a lot of blood. (At what point did wrestling become a sadistic geek show?) After waking up in a hospital bed, he's informed that he's had bypass surgery. He's also warned that he must give up on professional wrestling if he wants to stay alive. Adjusting to this new life will not be easy, and we know this because two very difficult relationships take center stage. One is with his estranged daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood); Randy knows that he was a terrible father, and he admits to thinking his career was more important than being there for his family. They try to make the best of the situation, although there's a sense that their relationship is broken beyond repair.    The other relationship is with an aging stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), who probably has more in common with Randy than with anyone else. She too may be past her prime, and yet she finds comfort in the consistency of her job. At first, she's merely on friendly terms with Randy. But as the film progresses, it's obvious that she's falling in love. There's a sadness to this character I found very compelling; she's good at what she does, but she seems unwilling to try for anything more. And even though she's always friendly around Randy, she always puts up a wall, as if she were purposely maintaining a sexy image to drive him away. If she lets him see the real her--fully clothed and with no fancy makeup or hair--he might actually see a person there and want to get to know her.    One of the more creative aspects of \\"The Wrestler\\" is the way Aronofsky follows Rourke around with a camera, making it seem like he's filming a documentary about a formerwrestler. It adds a personal touch that serves the story well, making it about character instead of about visual appeal. There are also numerous camera angels that reveal sadness without being explicit. Example: When Randy appears at an autograph signing, he looks around the room and sees a slew of other over-the-hill wrestlers, some with canes, others in wheelchairs. But Aronofsky doesn't linger on any specific shot, opting instead to keep things short and to the point.    Other moments reveal just how desperately Randy clings to the past. Consider a scene in which he and a neighborhood boy play a video game on the original eight-bit Nintendo system: The boy clearly can't identify with what he's playing because he describes a new game called \\"Call of Duty,\\" and he makes a point of saying that it's based on the Iraq War. And then there are a few scenes in a supermarket, where Randy has taken a job at the deli counter: While the first scene shows his attempt to make the most of it, the second one reveals his desperation to once again be in a wrestling ring. How interesting that he feels more comfortable performing for an audience than participating in real life--his true feelings come out in his final speech, which is both compelling and sad at the same time. \\"The Wrestler\\" is a wonderful film, perfectly cast, well written, and engaging as a probing character study.
B000002AP1|3.0|One of those important releases that just isn't very important to me. Besides the abomination of a remastery, I was just never a fan of Iggy's antics, and in general the songwriting was garage-sheik at best, preferring the gnarling distortion of repetition above all else. There is just enough approach however, to make a good half of the tiny album intriguingly primal enough not to wave it past.
B001HN6972|4.0|If there's one thing \\"The Reader\\" is above all else, it's a commentary on the power of the written word. This doesn't necessarily mean that the act of reading will change your life; sometimes, books have a very different power, the kind that can link people together in the most extraordinary ways. At other times, it's not about what has been printed, but about what has and hasn't been written by hand, and to say any more would be too revealing on my part. Based on Bernhard Schlink's novel \\"Der Vorleser,\\" \\"The Reader\\" is an absorbing examination of an unconventional love between a teenager and a war criminal. It's also a coming-of-age story, which isn't to suggest that it's solely focused on a transition from childhood to adulthood, or more figuratively, from ignorance to knowledge--there's another kind of maturation at work here, one that takes the processes of reading and writing and uses them for redemptive purposes.    The main character is Michael Berg, a German whose story shifts back and forth between 1958 and 1995. When he's introduced as a fifteen-year-old (David Kross), he lumbers off a bus into pouring rain, in the initial stages of scarlet fever. As he sits just inside a rundown apartment building, vomiting, a woman named Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet) passes by, cleans his mess, and offers to take him home. After three months of bed rest, he returns to Hanna's apartment to thank her. Sexual tension brews almost immediately, although nothing much happens until his second visit, when she in essence orders him to take a bath. There's no question that he's well aware of what's happening to his body, seeing as he's standing naked in front of an older, attractive woman; she seems to sense it too, which is why she brings him a towel without any clothes on.    Thus begins a summer-long affair, one that consists not only of lovemaking, but also of Michael reading literature to Hanna. Why she likes him to read aloud is not yet known. Being so infatuated, Michael doesn't question what he's doing. Nor does he notice the subtler nuances of Hanna's existence, the way she lives such a regimented life within the walls of her meager apartment. There always seems to be something she needs to do, whether it's ironing or gathering coal or washing out milk bottles. There's an interesting scene towards the end of their summer fling, in which Hanna washes Michael as he stands in the bathtub; despite the fact that it ends with them making love, there's nothing erotic about the way she scrubs him down. It's a distant moment, as if she were washing a hospital patient instead of her lover.    Without warning, the affair ends, leaving Michael with no choice other than returning home. The story then flashes forward to 1966, at which point he's studying law in Berlin. At around the same time, a group of women affiliated with the S.S. during World War II are brought to trial. One of them is Hanna. This represents a narrative shift, but in no way does it affect the overall theme; at this point in the story, Michael has transitioned from an innocent, fresh-faced young man to a chain-smoking, slightly unkempt college student. There's the sense that reality hasn't been treating him well. The same can be said for Hanna, who faces an unsympathetic judge, a group of women who go by the Judas philosophy, and a courtroom full of angry Nazi haters. When the judge interrogates Hanna about an event that resulted in numerous deaths, she seems genuinely baffled, as if to suggest that following orders is more important than following your conscious.    Interestingly, Michael finds himself in a very similar situation. He knows something about Hanna, something that, if revealed in court, could affect the verdict. The thing is, she's too ashamed to reveal it herself, leaving Michael in an awkward position: Should he obey the rules of law, or should he respect Hanna's wishes and keep her secret? It's a maddening dilemma, seeing as it's hard to have sympathy for a known associate of the Nazi party. Michael doesn't see her ugly past; he only sees the beautiful but solemn woman who physically and emotionally helped him transition into manhood.    During the sections of the story that take place between the 1970s and `90s, we see an adult Michael (Ralph Fiennes) who can't seem to let anyone get close to him. Given his former relationship with Hanna, it comes as no surprise that his attempt at marriage was unsuccessful. It also comes as no surprise that he's having trouble bonding with his grown daughter. As was the case earlier in his life, Michael must make the choice to change what he has the power to change. If he doesn't, there's a sense that he'll be doomed to a lifetime of regret. The greatness of \\"The Reader\\" comes from the fact that it's so focused on the act of decision-making, which, given the heavy-handed subtexts, makes it all the more powerful. Some may be critical of the meandering nature of the story, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not all that significant. What audiences should really pay attention to is the emphasis placed on the written word--it's actually quite clever how well the idea is woven throughout the film.
B00000272N|3.0|The reason this album has gathered far more dirt then its sucessor is simple.

B001FBSMW6|1.0|I am a huge Keane fan and have long awaited this album. After the months of loyal anticipation and eager waiting, I was given the opportunity to take a peak at Spiralling from keanemusic.com. I can honestly say that I was horrified. It sounds like '80's pop, which I guess if you appreciate '80's pop, then you might not mind their wanna-be 2008 attempt at it.    I had read an interview with Tim Rice-Oxley about their upcoming third album where he mentioned incorporating influence from American rap into Keane's music. The link to the actual interview is gone, so you'll have to trust me on the accuracy.    [...] >> Here's another place where the interview is quoted.  How would you describe the new stuff?   Well we're trying to combine different genres. I think we feel like we have a lot of different influences, including electronic music and dancey stuff and American rap, and we've not really found a way of including that into our first two albums, so we're trying to just spread our wings a bit more now. I think we just wanna make a record that combines the energy of all these different kinds of music that we listen to. But it's very early days.     So will you be rapping then?!   Ha! I doubt it, but nothing is out of the question really. I think our feeling is that British music can be very cyclical. You'll have a burst of amazing boundary-pushing music every few years, but then it can also be very parochial with people obsessed by the guitar-type music that's basically the same thing that's been coming out of Britain for the last 30 years. I think Brits can be afraid of being uncool or doing something that's not quite allowed and that fear is what stops people from doing really exciting stuff. The people that we really admire in music at the moment - like Kanye West and even some of these American pop/rock bands like Panic At The Disco - are doing something that's a lot more exciting than most of what's coming out of the UK. So I suppose we're just trying to lose ourinhibitions.    Anyway, when I first read that, I was scared that they would ruin their passionate, pure piano sound that radiates from Hopes & Fears (2004) and Under The Iron Sea (2006). This foreshadowing of the disasterous synthesizer sound was sadly accurate. I understand that the band wanted to put more of their other influences more prominently in this album, but I really don't agree with where they took the soul of their music to.    After all of this negativity, let me just say that I don't hate the entire album. So, to give you a better perspective, here are my ratings on each of the individual songs.    1. Spiralling - 2/10  - The only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because the tune is actually quite catchy and I find myself humming it sometimes before I realize what I'm even doing.  2. The Lovers Are Losing - 7/10  - I actually don't mind this song much at all. I really think it would sound good on traditional piano instead, though.  3. Better Than This - 1/10  - The wretched song heard at the very beginning makes me flinch every time. Nothing good about this song except the chorus is a kind of fun.  4. You Haven't Told Me Anything - 7/10  - This song isn't so bad either. Kind of boring, though. Nothing really going on in the background except for beeps and clicks.  5. Perfect Symmetry - 9/10  - If I had to pick a favorite song on the album, it would be Perfect Symmetry. It actually has some good piano in it! Sounds more like the old stuff.  6. You Don't See Me - 8/10  - Right by Perfect Symmetry as my favorite on the album, the chorus is beautiful. Again like the old stuff. Great lyrics. Some spots in the song are boring.  7. Again & Again - 7/10  - Really don't mind this song much either. The same stupid pattern of notes in the background throughout the song is awfully redundant, though.  8. Playing Along - 7/10  - Would be so much better with piano instead of boring and simple drum patterns.  9. Pretend That You're Alone - 4/10  - Boring drum beat inthe background. I think that the tune is okay, but a little annoying.  10. Black Burning Heart - 8/10  - This song isn't bad at all, really. Just has boring drumbeat again.  Love Is The End - 7/10  - Boring song, but has some good piano in it. Again with the boring drumbeats, though. Stuff that I could tap out myself, which is sad.    In essence, I really don't like the album as a whole. Where did Tim Rice-Oxley's brilliant piano and passionate compositions go? Where did Richard Hughes' complicated, captivating ACTUAL drumset beats go? Where did the smoothness of Tom Chaplin's voice reflected by the beautiful piano go? Maybe I'm for the old school piano, though. If you are a fan of electric sounds, then you might not mind this album at all. But if you're like me and appreciate the traditional piano quality to music, then really just skip it.
B000002LRX|4.0|4 1/2    You'd be hard pressed to find any band making art-pop-metal this interesting this early in the 90's, and onward for that matter. Unfortunately after the deceptive popularity of their previous radio smash \\"Epic\\", interest in the criminally underrated quintet declined as quality rose. This remains a near-flawless, visionary work; the kind of album that took a little getting used to, transitioning from TRT's friendlier pace, but never ceased to offer gifts which kept giving once initial objectivity was sought.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Ive been a fan of the show since season 1 and have bought each dvd when they came out to one day watch every episode straight through. Season 1 was great, seasons 2 and 3 were good at best but season 4 was great. Still not as great as the 1st season but still. They did a lot of good things while making it less confusing. We now see Flash Fowards and learn 6 of the survivors make it off the island, we get new bad guys, new allies and more.    The dvd is loaded with special features:    Commentaries- Listen to the cast and crew discuss certain episodes while you watch the episode  Right to Bare arms- Learn about all the guns they have on the show  The Freighter talk- Learn about the new faces seen on the Freighter  Lost in Hawaii- See how the turned Hawaii into the island on Lost  The Oceananic 6: A Conspiracy of lives- A Mocumentary questioning the survivors' story  Offshore shoot- Behind the scenes on the Freighter  Sound track of survivoring- See a performance of the show's orchestra  Lost on Location- Behind the scenes of the show  Course of the future-Look at the flashfowards  Bloopers- dont need to say anymore  Deleted scenes- See what scenes were lost    Buy if you love the show
0385338082|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  It was funny and relatable.  I couldn't put this book down, the times I had to I couldn't stop thinking about when I could begin reading it again.  You will not be dissapointed!
0312370849|4.0|This is the second of Tatiana de Rosnay's novels that I have read, and like the previous one  [[ASIN:2259197396 La M&eacute;moire des murs]] it revolves around a mystery associated with a Parisian apartment.<br /><br />In this case, the Marais apartment once occupied by ten-year-old Sarah and her family until they are rounded up in an infamous \\"rafle\\" of Parisian Jews in July 1942 is about to become home to American-born Julia Jaramond. The property, which has long been the property of her French husband's family, is now vacant, and will be refurbished. Julia, however, in the process of researching a story about the 60th anniversary of the \\"Vel d'Hiv\\" roundup, discovers that some of those deportees - who ended up at Auschwitz - had been the previous occupants. But there is no mention of the fate of their young daughter, Sarah...<br /><br />Thus begins Julia's quest to discover what happened to Sarah, amidst indifference or hostility from many members of her husband's family - reactions that aren't too dissimilar from those of French society as a whole, which prefers to think of the `rafle' as something orchestrated by the Nazis (although it was carried out entirely by French police). The first half of the book is told in short chapters that alternate between the voice of the young Sarah and that of Julia; eventually, the only voice is that of Julia, as she intensifies her search for Sarah's fate.<br /><br />Some of de Rosnay's plot twists are predictable, especially toward the end of the book when all the loose ends are neatly wrapped up and a bow placed atop their heads in a beautiful but too-tidy package. It's a little too convenient, for instance, that Julia's child happens to be a girl now almost exactly the age that Sarah was in 1942, for instance. (There is a particularly egregious twist or two toward the end, which I won't disclose as they would be spoilers.) Other plot twists are expected - the fate of Sarah's brother, for instance - and anything else would have been dramatic but implausible, as de Rosnay is astute enough to recognize. She avoids other twists that would have been far too blatant - every time I thought to myself, \\"oh, I know what is coming next\\", I didn't; the turn was a surprise, although never a shock. The result is a solid if unspectacular narrative, told by a novelist with a great eye for character, dialogue and sense of place. On the Virginia Woolf-to-Sophie Kinsella continuum, this definitely ranks toward the Kinsella end of the spectrum - it's far from unique or literary in either theme or structure - but it's a pageturner with a lot of meat on its bones and some very good writing. Another \\"thumping good read\\", if it's OK to say that about a novel that revolves around a tragic event.<br /><br />While the book is a natural fit for anyone interested in the French experience of the Holocaust (and how they have dealt with the legacy), and would be a great book club read, anyone who is looking for an undemanding but dramatic read based on some strong characters would find it worthwhile. I gather they are making a movie based on the book in France; it would be interesting to see Kristin Scott Thomas (who speaks impeccable French and can put together a mean American accent when required) in the title role, even though she doesn't physically resemble Julia's character. (Hopefully they won't make the same casting errors as they did with the film of Diane Johnson's Le Divorce.)<br /><br />Which reminds me - anyone curious about what it's like to live as a long-term expat or an American in Paris who doesn't want to tackle Wharton or Henry James, and who likes this book, should try Diane Johnson's three novels ([[ASIN:0452277337 Le Divorce (William Abrahams Book)]], [[ASIN:0452282268 Le Mariage]], [[ASIN:0452285631 L'Affaire]]). They are more dramatic novels of manners in nature, whereas de Rosnay's is a serious drama, but they do a beautiful job of explaining what happens when Americans try to coexist withthe French in Paris. (The film was a very bad version of a not-at-all-bad book.)<br /><br />Hopefully we will now see some of de Rosnay's other work appear in English??version of a not-at-all-bad book.)      Hopefully we will now see some of de Rosnay's other work appear in English??
B000W4KT6E|1.0|The whole family fell asleep watching this one:  wife, 3 kids, family dog, me.    We thought it would be fun because we laughed so much when we saw the original (the one with Divine).    And it marks the end of the civil rights era as far as I'm concerned.  The issues are presented in such a light-weight, ho-hum, humdrum way, by such light-weight actors, that it's practically a slap in the face to anyone who really cares about civil rights.    I miss Divine.
0385340540|1.0|As previous disappointed readers before me have stated, (for a summary of the plot any one of the 500+ descriptions from reviews prior to mine will do) The Broker was not John Grisham's best work by a long shot.  The story was flat and definitely not a legal thriller and the ending was boring.  I struggled to finish the novel, hoping it would somehow get better toward the end of the story, sadly, that was not the case.

0545128285|5.0|A collection of wizard fairy tales (which exists and influences in the Potterverse) with (frankly unnecessary) Joseph Campbell-like commentary from Albus Dumbledore adds richness and depth to the already fantastic and profound world and stories that Rowling has created. Rowling weaves her magic once again, twisting folklore for her magical world, reflecting her messages back on it once again. It isn't just her cleverness and all her magical little details; it is her knowledge of the human soul and human behavior and human psychology. It should be noted that the illustrations, done by JKR herself, are more beautiful and stylish than anything in any of the other American Potter publishings. Grade: A
B000OY8NII|5.0|While I have never caught this show on Sci-Fi, I recently picked up season one.  I had expectations that it might be good.  Honestly, this show is quickly growing to become one of my favorite television shows anywhere. The smart storylines keep you wondering where things will go next.      I can honestly say that this is one of the very few times I've put a DVD series in and pressed \\"Play All\\" that I've proceeded to watch almost ALL!    I strongly suggest this show!
B001BWDG0W|2.0|Going in, Mama Mia was working with the advantage of some very catchy, if flyweight tunes. But for a musical to really shine, the singers should be able to, you know, sing.    I just can't fathom the thought process behind casting Pierce Brosnan. There are no good looking, middle aged actors who actually have some vocal chops? Robert Lindsay may not be a poster boy, but he could have killed in that role.    I imagine there is a recording out there with a London or Broadway cast that would be much more rewarding listening.
B001AP11KW|3.0|Forming The Raconteurs was the greatest idea Jack White has ever had. When he realized that his main project, The White Stripes, wasn't going anywhere, he got together with Brendan Benson and the remnants of the band The Greenhornes. The result was something that sounded nothing like anything White had ever done, and it was recieved warmly by critics. The music is a combination of indie rock, blues, and folk with lyrics similar to those of Beck's (\\"Intimate Secretary,\\" \\"Store Bought Bones\\") and it sounds like nothing I've ever heard. At a mere thirty three minutes, the album is extremely upbeat and very easy to get through, and it only gets weak near the end. The album is in no way repetative and every song is unique, especially with White and Benson sharing vocals. For the most part, the music is very light and cheery with the exception of the song \\"Broken Boy Soldier.\\" Somehow White makes his voice sound like a scary old lady and the song honestly creeps the snot out of me. But in a good way, I guess.
B000UR9T82|3.0|I have mixed feelings about having purchased this item, first of all I'd like to mention the 3 stars go to the set and not the movies.<br /><br />Since I got my PS3 and my HDTV set I became a fan of high definition. I loved Spiderman and loved Spiderman 2 even more. I actually never bought Spiderman 3 on DVD as to me, it is Spiderman's \\"Batman forever\\". I owned thought 1 and 2 on their special 2 disc edition each, I decided to sell those in order to get the HD version and I kinda regret that.<br /><br />In the box:<br /><br />Spiderman (1 disc)<br />Spiderman 2 and 2.1 (1 disc)<br />Spiderman 3 (2 discs, feature film and bonus features)<br /><br />While the movies look and sound incredible on Bluray, Spiderman 1 and 2 have no extras whatsoever! For a trilogy set so eagerly anticipated by fans, Sony put very little effort in this release. Yes, they released the movies in full HD but got rid of all the extras on 1 and 2! Only Spiderman 3 has a bonus disc and like I said before, is my least favorite of the three. The documentaries, easter eggs (like Alfred Molina dressed as Doc Oc performing \\"If I were a rich man\\") and bonus features from the first two are not in the trilogy boxset!<br /><br />The only good thing I can think of to make me feel better is the fact that I got this at the Gold Box deal for $37<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this set if you're interested in the movies only, if you expect an upgrade from the DVD versions like I did, this will only disappoint you.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The final album by the politically active metal/funk band is by far their best. Even though it's a combination of all the genres I dislike--rap, metal, with a little bit of funk--it's still one of the most powerful albums I've ever listened to. The whole thing is just so incredibly catchy that it makes you want to listen to it over and over again. One thing that makes the band so great is that they're so much different than any other band today or in the 90s when they were most popular. They always took a stand and they did whatever they felt was right to do, whether it was putting upsidedown American flags up on stage during a performance on Saturday Night Live or going on stage completely naked at Lollapalooza. No other band has ever had such revolutionary ideas, and it's very unfortunate that they broke up. Anyway, Los Angeles is a great album, and I recommend it even if you don't like crappy music.
0446604844|1.0|TOTAL CONTROL is David Baldacci's second novel, following his tremendous debut ABSOLUTE POWER.  Unfortunately, Baldacci suffers from a major case of the sophomore jinx here.<br /><br />The major problem with this novel is the byzantine plot.  The storyline is so convoluted that I had real problems following it.  A series of events take place and Baldacci makes little effort to connect them coherently.  Normally, Baldacci's strength is his plotting and pacing, but those skills are largely absent in this novel.<br /><br />The characterization in TOTAL CONTROL is paper-thin, which is a common problem with a lot of Baldacci's work.  Normally, his plotting skills make up for the cartoonish characters, but that doesn't happen here.  The result is a tedious, confusing read that is not worth your time.<br /><br />I've read about eight novels by Baldacci, and I would say TOTAL CONTROL was probably the worst of the bunch.  Avoid this one, and read ABSOLUTE POWER if you haven't done so already.
0802714544|5.0|This spy novel has it all: fleshed-out characters, excellent dialogue, wonderful pacing and a plot that's replete with uncertainty. The writer held me on the edge of my seat right to his thrilling finish, after which the characters and intrigues continued to linger in my mind.<br /><br />Through the eyes of Le Carre, a genuine spook, I became struck by the high drama of the Cold War period, including the stakes, the rivalries, and most interesting of all, the ambiguities. I say that despite remembering the late Cold War era because the author portrays the battle of the Soviet Bloc versus the West with a vividness and sensitivity one could never glean from TV broadcasts, newspapers and magazines. Le Carre's a brutal and fearless artist; weaned on a diet of Hollywood cliches where \\"the German\\" is usually cast as stupid, I was refreshed--even shocked--to visit a world where Mundt could be the smartest man in the room and where America's arch enemy just might win.<br /><br />Fantastic read. I thought Le Carre could have tightened up the sequence at the Bayswater Library for Psychic Research, but otherwise there's no fluff here and loads of suspense.<br /><br />My Titles<br />[[ASIN:1419645498 Shadow Fields]]<br />[[ASIN:1419649256 Snooker Glen]]<br />[[ASIN:1419655817 Dasha]]
B001LUMY0W|5.0|Summary: A Prisoner of Birth by Jeffrey Archer<br /><br />I have been a fan of Jeffrey Archer since Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less and I too agree that he is one of the best story tellers today.<br /><br />The back cover states, \\"the author spent five years in the House of Commons, sixteen years in the House of Lords and two years in Her Majesty's prisons....\\" This book was written after that time spent in prison in which he kept extensive diaries.<br /><br />Prisoner of Birth is a fascinating story about two mates/friends that were celebrating at a pub and one of them ended up dead and the other ended up in prison. He weaves together the life in prison, the lives of police, the lives of lawyers, the lives of judges, the life of parole boards and the lives of everyday normal people.<br /><br />You will find this book hard to put down and you will wonder what kind of movie it will turn out to be.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I probably don't have anything to say that hasn't already been said.  This album is a classic and I love it.  Foreplay/Long Time is my favorite Boston creation.

B00008YJH5|5.0|If you follow rock music at all, look at \\"essential album\\" lists, etc, then surely you must have heard of the Pixies second release \\"Surfer Rosa\\" (1988). Similar to \\"Nothing Shocking\\" (1988) the Jane's Addiction album, \\"Surfer Rosa\\" was ahead of its' time--as both albums, in a sense were sort of the precursors for what was to follow in the early 90s with the (brief) mass popularity of alternative rock. And while one can certainly see the similarities to Nirvana, the Pixies were maybe a little more offbeat, left-of-center and humorous.<br /><br />Much like with Nirvana's \\"Nevermind,\\" (1991) with \\"Surfer Rosa\\" it's sometimes hard to separate the hype/mythology from the actual music. If you've never heard this album, it's probably best to try to forget everything you have heard about it and just give it an honest, objective listen.<br /><br />One thing I notice about this album is how spontaneous, live and organic it sounds. More than anything else it sounds incredibly fresh and timeless. It's amazing that this album is twenty-years old.<br /><br />With only one song over four minuets and the pace moving quickly, this album is sort of an adrenaline rush. And while the contrast between the raw, intense moments and the quieter ones (often within the same song) may initially strike the listener as odd, it actually works really well.<br /><br />While in all honesty \\"Surfer Rosa\\" isn't quite as good as \\"Nevermind\\" or some of the Pixie's later music, Frank Black and company still created a classic album that is certainly essential to any decent CD collection.
B00012FXB8|3.0|I remember seeing Alien and Aliens and I consider them classics and was really looking forward to this one. However this one seemed to be a whacky spinoff from the originals. It was pathetic, the story was dull and the characters weren't interesting and were boring. Sigourney Weaver seemed tired and not interested in her character especially now that she had no hair. Another major let down is that the Alien is now CGI animated and doesn't build up any tension and isn't frightening in most scenes and frankly when the prisoners were being killed I didn't care. Also we see a brand new breed of alien. With the replicated genes of a dog, this alien runs on all fours, is incredibly fast, and is by far the meanest Alien we have ever seen in this movie series yet. The bad parts about the movie are obvious. After seeing the Colonial marines in action, it is tough to see the events of this movie. You will miss the marines. Another very troubling aspect is the deahts of Hicks and Newt, whom Ripley had strived so very hard to rescue in the last movie, only to have their lives sorrowfully taken from them.<br /><br />There is no suprise that this one was the least successful in the Alien series. Especially being directed by constant underacheiver David Fincher also with striking imagery makes for muddled action and the script confuses it further. The ending looks startling but it takes a long time and a not particularly satisfying journey to get there. Truly this should of had been the last movie in the series.<br /><br />For most fans of the series this movie was a disappointment and there was no suprise that this one was the least successful and popular. Unfortunately, Alien: Resurrection ruined this closure by bringing us a rather poor plot and extremely poor acting, not to mention a whole new take on the Aliens, which i felt was stupid and unnecessary. Keep Alien 3 as the final movie. Watch Alien: Resurrection if you are in the mood for a 'wacky spin-off', because that is all it is.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining television series ever!  Why it was cancelled after only one season is beyond me.  The acting is crisp, yet humorous and the mix of good old fashioned human interaction, fight scenes, and technology is top notch.  Best reviewed BEFORE watching the movie \\"Serenity\\" to get the full impact of the movie.  It is amazing how worthless television series can run for years without being yanked and a show of such quality and fun ad \\"Firefly\\" can be dropped so quickly.
B001H5U232|1.0|Much as I love Pat Metheny's music, I have to damn this recording, and firmly:  DON'T SPEND ANY MONEY ON **THIS**!!!  The only reason this dud has received any five-star reviews is because Metheny's music is so transparently wonderful that it shines when even the worst performers attempt it -- as is the case here with Metheny's Polish collaborator.  Unfortunately, her rather unremarkable voice takes away greatly from what would otherwise be a pure pleasure.    For a clue as to how Metheny's and Mays's music should be handled, listen instead to that Chicago marvel, Kurt Elling on his 2003 CD Man In The Air.  Elling has a clear facility with lyrics, as his take on Minuano amply demonstrates:  both the song and the singer simply soar.  As well they should!  I could listen to that take endlessly, just as I could the original on Still Life (Talking).  I doubt anyone would feel that way about anything on Upojenie, given a choice:  this was simply an experiment that should never have been recorded.  Experiments are well and good, and useful -- but the ones that fail should be culled immediately in favor of better work.  Nobody would miss **this** disaster if it fell off the discography ...    Seriously, check out the Kurt Elling version of Minuano.  Breathtaking!!  One can only hope that he performs and writes lyrics for more Pat Metheny tunes (perhaps Metheny will notice and propose a jam session).  In fact, THAT would be a collaboration truly *worth* hearing.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie is the final chapter and validation of a great television series that was cancelled too soon.  Alas, a strong fan base was able to convince producers to bring this wonderful story of frontierspeople against the mega-military-industrial-society complex to the big screen.  Best viewed after watching the entire \\"Firefly\\" series to understand the context, but also stands alone as a entertaining movie.  I actually watched the movie before the series myself, but later watched the series and filled in the blanks.  Either way, enjoy!
0937381888|5.0|I own this book as well as the -Joy- book from Papazian and the guide from Miller. None of these three books gave me all the informations I wanted to have, but together they did quite well. I find the information in the this book the most complete and well organized (he does not cover Kreusening, but thats about it). He gives you a lot of formulas and sheets to do calculations for the variation of given recipes or creation of your own. The all grain recipes are definitely for the intermediate brewer.
0060920084|4.0|The Lost Continent drives the reader through small town America. Told with a sense of humor and attention to detail, Bryson makes the reader feel like they are riding in the passengers seat as he drives from one  town to another. As he drives into familiar towns, he shares his reflections on how life was and how it has changed over time. An interesting read for someone who enjoys long cross country road trips.
B000SXMQ24|5.0|Some of the best music that they (Floyd) have ever made. The story it tells, the depth and flow of the sound is very moving. I've probably listened to it at least a thousand times and I get a different feel from it every time.<br /> I had wrote a different review on it using some left handed sarcastic humor, from the view of a pot smoking acid popping freak. Which in my opinion is the way that the music was made to be experienced. Some people didn't get it so I decided to re write my review on it.<br />  But either way, strait or freak, you will either love it or hate it. It depends on your taste in music.<br /> In my younger wilder days this was one of the top 5 albums to listen to while partying. In my older days, I'm 50 now and had to give up a lot of the fun things that I used to do, I still like to put this on the stereo, kick back, listen to it with the headphones on and remember better times.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great intense workout.  I own many many workout dvds, and this is one of the hardest.    It requires very little space, which is a huge plus.     The first day I got it, I did level 1 and level 2, needed to rest for a few hours, and then did level 3.  While this is a great, tiring workout, I don't know if just one segment daily would be enough to produce change in people who works out avidly.  I do this to supplement my daily workouts.  I do level 3 in combo with 40 minutes of running or level 2 after a lotte berk type workout.    It is great, Jillian is totally motivating and not annoying-thank goodness, that isn't the case with other videos of hers I own.     I hope there are more great GM videos to come, maybe even one that has longer segments.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Like many other people, I saw this for free when they released it online. However, after watching it I immediately went and bought it, because they deserve my money for making such a great movie. The movie alone was worth the money, so the awesome musical commentary was just a bonus for me. One thing to note though: this dvd is a burned disc with a label on it.Seriously, if you look closely, you can see that it says \\"Verbatim 8x dvd-r\\" under the label, and it has the same purple bottom as most burnable dvd-r's, instead of the usual silver bottom of pressed discs. I personally didn't care, but I figured this might be something potential buyers may want to know. It's still worth every penny, in my opinion.
B000N0W9WO|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite films. It's tender, funny, romantic and all with a happy ending that you don't mind watching over and over again! [[ASIN:B000N0W9WO The Holiday (2006) [Blu-ray]]] has great stars who all come off as likeable and interesting. Jude Law is at his sexiest in this one, even with Cameron Diaz as his love interest. Cameron's character was the one I liked the least, but even her acting (or lack of...) couldn't come close to ruining this one for me. Jack Black isn't his usual goofy guy, but rather a gentle 'good guy' who befriends the lovely Kate Winslet while she's on 'holiday' retreating from an impossible love affair.<br /><br />Sweet and charming, this film is a wonderful date movie or chick flick for any time of the year.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I happened upon this show by luck as I was mindlessly flipping through channels one day, and I have been hooked on it ever since. Sadly, I found it halfway through Season 1, so when it came out on dvd I was beyond thrilled to have gotten it for Christmas.   This show is, in my opinion, the funniest comedy to come around in a long time. I have never seen an episode that hasn't made me burst into tears from fits of laughter. And now that I've got the first season on dvd, I can watch my favorite moments any time I want, as many times as I want (and I admit there are some scenes I can't get enough of)---and I still fall off the couch laughing.  The characters are perfectly cast, and are both annoying and lovable at the same time.   The only negative thing I can think of about this show is that the episodes are only a half hour.   I recomend this show to anyone!
6305388458|3.0|This one-disc version of Python's historical (note I did not say historically accurate)comedy set at the time of Jesus is rare among comedies in that it's still able to retain most of its humour value over the years and hence ages quite well.  Although not all the scenes remain funny, there were some that left me in stitches such as the \\"Biggus Dickus\\" scenes with Pontius Pilate while the UFO scene was just stupid and actually in my opinion took away from the comedic value of the film a great deal.  Like \\"Ben Hur\\" this film is set at the time of the birth of Christianity but other than that the story has really very little to do with Christ or Christianity in general other than as a minor sub-plot.<br /><br />The story here is about a group of sinners who try to scrape a living by surviving the brutality of the Romans and particularly one of them, Brian, who is mistaken for a prophet and for a while the Messiah.  Historians will tell you that in real life, many people at the time of Jesus were mistaken for the Messiah and even John the Baptist was as well and so there's nothing unusual here.  They will also tell you that crucificion was the norm and not the exception as a form of punishment in those days and so I chose to take this comedy at face value and I never felt insulted in any way as a Christian myself.  In any case, if your faith is founded on strong foundations, comedies like these shouldn't faze you.  In fact, I thought the film was rather respectful of Christ himself and that the only buffoons were the cast who misunderstood his teachings and if you recall even in real life he faced a lot of sinners who misunderstood him and so again, nothing out of the ordinary here.  If any historical figure was made to look like a jackass here it would have to be Pontius Pilate and some of the Roman soldiers and I'm sure not many people would have complaints about that.<br /><br />This widescreen format dvd version though has decent picture quality although at too many spots the white circle that signals the start of a commercial is present which is really unacceptable and the sound quality is poor although those with a Pro Logic setup can more or less simulate surround sound and there are not special features at all.  The best thing to do is to wait for a properly restored and remastered standard or Blu-ray version to surface with much, much improved picture and sound quality with at least 5.1 surround sound options and if a Director's Cut version is to be done to please remove the ridiculous UFO scene from what is otherwise an intelligent and funny comedy.e circle that signals the start of a commercial is present which is really unacceptable and the sound quality is poor although those with a Pro Logic setup can more or less simulate surround sound and there are not special features at all.

B0013ND30W|5.0|This has exceeded my expectations more than any BD I've watched thus far. The AQ is fantastic and the PQ is just breathtaking. Watching this on VHS as a child, I never realized the stunning beauty of this film, however, on the BD I noticed in every frame... the geometric backgrounds look exactly as though any given scene was plucked from an illustrated page of a gorgeous book of fairy tales. It's just beautiful.
B0000A02U2|4.0|Everyone raves about Belushi's work here and rightly so but people tend to forget about the great work of the rest of the cast who went on to even greater comedic and dramatic heights such as Stephen Furst who is brilliant here as Flounder who went on to become Vir on the excellent \\"Babylon 5\\" series as well as Kevin Bacon (Footloose etc), Karen Allen (Indiana Jones etc), Tom Hulce (Amadeus)and the rest which is what makes this a rare example of a comedy that retains a lot of its ability to make us laugh over the years and hence age well.<br /><br />If you like your comedies in the \\"Police Academy\\" and its many sequels ilk then this one will amuse you no end and ranks among the best ever of the National Lampoon franchise.  The Special Feature mockumentary \\"Where Are They Now?...\\" is amusing as well although not quite as good as the main course humour-wise and \\"The Yearbook: An Animal House Reunion\\" is also a very nice touch.  The dvd itself is decent although I regret now getting the Full Screen version which does seem to omit a lot of the original film and the picture quality although not the best I've seen is mostly free from the usual imperfections such as white spots etc and the sound quality has been given the 5.1 surround sound treatment although this hasn't improved the quality that much.<br /><br />Overall though this is an acceptable dvd version of a funny comedy that ages well although you may want to wait for a better restored and remastered picture and sound quality version in anamorphic widescreen format perhaps in a Director's Cut if John Landis ever gets the time to do such a project to surface in either the standard or preferably the Blu-ray format.
B000086EOE|5.0|If you're looking for rote reinterpretations of classic Genesis songs don't buy this. You will be severely disappointed. On the other hand if you are seeking a new \\"twist\\" on old Genesis songs(and for the most part \\"classic\\") then go no further. Look further down. You can get this CD cheaper at the time of this writing.     I'm giving it ***** stars for the singular reason that this has an all star cast of '70's musicians, the reinterpretations are not ROTE, and finally because it is a perfect marriage with The Tokyo Tapes(i.e. the live versions+); Although both may be outdated with The Genesis File.    Nevertheless. Gosh I love this CD and wish I bought it in the 1990s. Sincerely; There are too many highlights to list. And if you don't like revisions; Well? Go away. I'm a Zappa/Dead fan and so am used to the restructuring of songs.     Highlights:     \\"Watcher Of The Skies.\\" Devestating  \\"Firth Of Fifth.\\" Killer even without the Tony Banks intro piano solo.  \\"Fountain Of Salmacis.\\" The sole reason I bought this CD. Devestating.    There are nice ambient touches such as on \\"The Valley Of Kings.\\" \\"Waiting Room Only\\" does contain the heart of \\"Waiting Room\\" off of TLLDOB. A refreshing reinterpretation of \\"I Know What I Like.\\"    This CD doesn't take long to unravel its inherent charms.
B000002KCB|4.0|Great Neil Young album.  Not as good as \\"Everybody Knows...\\" which is stellar all the way through.  The good songs on this one are great, and the rest is good.
B00005NGS7|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites.<br />It tells and shows a lot of things and in some moments it can even make me drop a tear. It is a very good movie but also very sad.<br />It is definitely a must see , and i can nothing else but recommend it!<br />- Andreas
0765316897|5.0|I have been avidly reading fantasy novels for the past fifteen years, and I have to say that Brandon Sanderson has created one of the most intelligent, well thought out books I have ever gotten my hands on. One of the best aspects of the book is that it doesn't have a \\"typical\\" fantasy plot. The characters are deep and emotional, and the magic system is complex though understandable and always very interesting. The story is an exciting page turner with a great ending most people wont expect (although he leaves little hints throughout the book). The book has two wonderful climaxes with a little bit of breathing room between them. This is a must read for all fantasy lovers.    Not only is Sanderson a wonderful (and wonderfully fast) writer, he genuinely cares about his fans. I started reading his blog when I found out that he is finishing the Wheel of Time series for Mr. Jordan, and I now check his blog and his forum every day. He loves to keep his fans in the loop about his work while giving them little tidbits about upcoming books so we can theorize about them. In short, Brandon Sanderson is one of the best new writers of our day, and I expect even greater things to come from him in the future.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I just got back from a trip to Disney World. All of us had a great time, but my biggest disappointment was that I never found anything that relates to this movie. Why, Disney? This film has some of the best scenes, or at least some of the funniest scenes, ever created by Disney. Those of you who have seen it know what I mean. \\"Why do we even have that lever?\\" \\"Or, to save on postage...\\" Tom Jones! OK, I guess this review is for those who never have seen the film. In that case, just let me say that you won't be disappointed. The middle drags a little bit, but the opening 30 minutes or so and a later scene in a restaurant are so outstanding it is absolutely worth owning. David Spade at his best!
0316001821|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect, but after getting over the rape/ murder of Suzie, I settled into what was a very provocative story of love and renewal. It is more about the way the family deals with the tragedy than the actual tragedy itself and that is what gives the story its purpose. The family, for good and bad, deals with the death in their own way, and inturn, Suzie, comes to realize her family will move past the tragedy-- and so will she.
B000002KAT|5.0|After listening to this album for the gazillionth time the other night, it occurred to me that if I had to pick just one album to take to the grave this would be it. While I love much of VM's music, for me Astral Weeks is only approached by the almost-as-wonderful Veedon Fleece.     I'm not going to write a lengthy review, many others have already done so much better than I could but I figured I should give perhaps the best album ever recorded a 5 star rating. So here it is.
B0017SWSCW|5.0|This was the first book I received on my new Kindle and I can't put it down.  This is a courtroom thriller combined with action.  All the other reviews saying this is a modern times Count of Monte Cristo are exactly right.  Jeffrey Archer's style is brilliant and takes you on an incredible chronological journey of a man up for trial for a crime he did not commit.  Archer takes you from one perspective to another without the slightest break or interruption.  This book just flows and it is exciting.  I highly recommend and the Kindle version is great as well!
B00005ATQM|5.0|that there are over 1000 reviews and no mention that I can find pointing out that this is an excellent surround mix.  What happened to reviewing a product?--Oh I forgot, people prefer to bicker about the point in which a band \\"sold out\\".  Truly sad.
0920668372|5.0|Out of morbid curiousity, I read some of the 'one star' reviews for this book. I was, honestly, shocked. My mother used to read this book (among many others) to me and my three siblings growing up. All four of us remember it lovingly and tenderly. It has such a sweet, moving story line. Some reviewers said it was 'creepy' that the mother came into the child's bedroom at night to watch him sleep. Well, if that's creepy, there is something wrong with me, because I love to watch my daughter sleep. It's so peaceful and it helps me remember after a hectic day what a precious gift I have. Anyway, the book has cute illistrations, humorous antics from the little boy in the story, and a feeling of sincere warmth and love surrounding the whole thing. I personally plan to get it for my little one when she is a little older (she's only an infant now).
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|No wonder people are raving over this film!!! It's a musical for sure. It's a comedy--part of the time. It's dramatic--some of the time. And it is entertaining ALL of the time! I laughed! I cried! I cheered! I sang! I love this film--and the best part was Meryl Streep dancing and singing in all parts--whether as part of the story or in her trio.<br /><br />Everyone was delightful in his/her role. It is true--the singers are not trained professionals--they are more like real people singing in real situations. OK, most people don't blurt out in song, but wouldn't you rather have Meryl sing her own songs than have her lip sync as Audrey Hepburn did in \\"My Fair Lady?\\"<br /><br />Or to see and hear Pierce Brosnan sing so painfully in his role? His struggle lent credence to his role as a once-heartbroken young man who finds himself 20 years later in a place make amends. His singing was sweet and heartfelt.<br /><br />Or Julie Waters' show-stopping number toward the end of the film. \\"Take a Chance on Me!\\" Indeed! Or the concept of the Greek chorus (you get it?!!)--Greek chorus, made up of local villagers in just the right places for the numbers. Especially the women following Meryl/Donna scene.<br /><br />Mamma Mia--my mamma is known, but who is my dad? Sophie finds her mother's journal the summer she was conceived only to learn that her dad could be one of three men. How this is resolved is one of the great moments of the movie. It's a Greek wedding under the summer sun with a touch of Shakespeare's Midsummer Night's Dream of magic and confusion. As in the Bard's play things are set back in order, maybe a new order by movie's end.<br /><br />To get there the viewer will experience a brouhaha of ABBA melodies (the musical is based on their hits) rousing, funny, and serious. When Meryl/Donna sings to Pierce just before the wedding, my heart broke with hers. Wow, that was as powerful a scene as anything she's done dramatically in other roles.<br /><br />But enough. I want to finish watching the Feature Commentary in which Director Phyllida Lloyd explains each scene: where, how, purpose. I must confess that I didn't know outdoor scenes are often shot in studio simulations.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, I am in the Camp of \\"Mamma Mia!\\" enthusiasts. This is Review #178.Director Phyllida Lloyd explains each scene: where, how, purpose. I must confess that I didn't know outdoor scenes are often shot in studio simulations.

1401322336|5.0|Originally, I bought this Book in order to well, frankly, make my Wife a better Cook...    Pros:    -Wide Range of Recipes.  -Instructions are very Easy to Follow  -Well Written by one of if not the Best Chefs out there    Con:  -I have not been able to Find some of the rarer Ingredients but that is Typical since I'm now living in Honolulu...    We BOTH Fell in Love with Jamie's Cook Book and were very Impressed with this Great Cookbook.  Have to say that this has made me the Better Cook as I have learned a lot but also find that what I when I want to make something 75% it will be in this Book.
0679736646|5.0|i wish i was no longer alive... there is no god and there is no dog either. suicide might be the cure if only i would die for real... my mom told me if i had nothing nice to say to just say nothing at all. i bought his book after he died just to spite him. buy this book then die or don't buy this book then die, it's your choice... or will you?
B000002L7J|5.0|I disagree with those who consider this one of their \\"middling\\" albums. Every song on the album is pretty strong. I can do without the title song--\\"Heifer whines could be human cries....\\" Tracks 1 through 5, played in succession, are as strong as anything the Smiths ever did and flow really well. \\"How Soon Is Now\\" is a great, if overplayed, song. \\"Nowhere Fast\\" and \\"Well I Wonder\\" are also great songs. Anyways, this album with their last 2 studio albums, \\"The Queen is Dead,\\" and \\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\" cemented the Smiths as one of the greatest bands of their time. Add in, their singles collections and they were amazing.
B001BR5F4C|1.0|The movie I've been waiting for for a considerable length of time now is *not* yet another release of volumes 1 & 2 respectively or in a twin pack, whether they are on Blu-ray or not. No, I, and several others like me, are holding out for \\"Kill Bill - The Whole Bloody Affair\\". The full-length, uncut, unedited, unadulterated version as it was originally meant to be seen that we were promised over two years ago. And until the studio executives finally get off their duffs and release it, (DVD or Blu-Ray, I'm not picky), I refuse to give them my hard earned money just so they can double-dip later down the road if and when the superior version finally comes out, and I suggest you hold off too.
B000001DTM|5.0|I don't know how to say what's got to be said...one of the best albums ever recorded. Period. I was resistant to this album for the first couple of years after it was released because I was completely comfortable with U2 albums prior to this: Boy, October, War, Unforgettable Fire,Joshua Tree, Rattle & Hum ...Wow, entirely different. Once I gave it a chance and dug my in my heels (circa 1993) it completely blew my mind, and it still does. There isn't a wasted track on this entire album. I've probably listened to it 500+times from start to finish. Don't be misled, the complexity and depth of this album is unreal on many levels -lyrically, musically, spiritually. Buy it if you haven't already. Play....Listen..... Absorb....
B00006RAKP|1.0|Heyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy! I love easy listening music but this Elton John guy needs to take a few pointers from modern day singers... I admit it, hes cute and proud to be gay (like me =]) but I'd take Justin Bieber any day over this guy.
1400064287|4.0|This is great marketing information, inclusive of tangible examples.    Each year I set a goal of reading a book each week--this year having doubled back to re-read Made to Stick because it a just that great!    I look forward to reading more from the Heath Brothers.
B001ILHY2C|4.0|I remember seeing the previews of this movie thinking \\"meh\\". I was wrong. I watched this movie and couldn't believe that it was the movie from the previews. It is no oscar winner for sure, but I doubt anyone reading this thought it would be. It is a very solid action movie. There are some surprisingly great actors in the movie. The cars are cool, the action is great, and the movie delivers.    If you like action movies with a plot that is decent enough to accompany the action then you should add this to your cart or at least to you netflix queue. You won't be disappointed.    If you ever thought that Twisted Metal would be cool to see as a movie then this is it.

0316042994|5.0|Waugh has given the modern reader a true as possible glimpse into the English aristocracy of the 20' and 30's. He admits that the novel was semi-auto-biographical, as he writes in 1959:<br /><br />\\"It seemed then that the ancestral seats which were our chief national achievement were doomed to decay and spoliation like the monasteries in the 16th century. So I piled it on rather, with passionate sincerity.\\"<br /><br />These old English mansions and the `culture' that lived within its walls unfortunately were and are, close to extinction. So for Waugh, he felt passionately compelled to write this book for future generations.<br /><br />Lord Marchmain's patriarchal hold on his family was immense: rules of aristocratic society and the Catholic church's dogmas, at times, contradicted each other, which in turn ruined many lives during that period. This I believe is the essence of the novel, prompting the reader to ponder man-made laws and rules (whether church or state) that do indeed change with the times.<br /><br />Sebastian is my favourite character: eccentric, playful, creative, intelligent and a hopeless alcoholic. Some reader's have suggested that his latent homosexuality, his religious belief's, and the guilt this imposed on his conscience, was the cause, in the end, of his drinking himself to death. This may be true. But as another reviewer has written, all the characters in this novel are terribly complex, and to make such a diagnosis may be too hasty, premature, and needs further discussion.<br /><br />For some modern readers this novel may seem dated or irrelevant. However Waugh gives a little insight into the life and times of a culture that has passed into history.<br /><br />Excellent reading.
B000B8QF14|5.0|It's funny to read the reviews from people declaring this band a \\"sell-out\\" and how they don't play shows like they used to.  I've seen them play in a pizza parlor before they even released a record and I've seen this arena show.  They were awesome back then, but I was really surprised how well this show was in such a large venue.  It is difficult to play an arena show with the same intimacy as a small club.  It is just a different type of show.  It's not better nor is it worse.  I thought this was a great show and I like the fact that Billie Joe can perform a little without the guitar.  This adds a little intimacy in the arena type of venue.  All in all a great show.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|Roger Corman serves as an executive producer on DEATH RACE, a loose remake of his 1975 futuristic cult classic, DEATH RACE 2000.  In fact, David Carradine, who starred in that earlier film, plays \\"Frankenstein\\" in the opening sequence of this version.<br /><br />Jason Statham stars in the 2008 release from Universal Studios Home Entertainment.  He plays a former race car driver who is framed for the murder of his wife, so that he will be sent to the prison where the lucrative, nationally televised \\"Death Race\\" originates.<br /><br />Warden Joan Allen offers Statham his freedom if he will participate in the \\"kill or be killed\\" race.<br /><br />This picture is grounded much more in reality than the 1975 original, and if you can accept the film's outrageous basic premise, then you will find it to be very entertaining.  The race sequences may be rather gory, but they are extremely well-staged.<br /><br />Paul W.S. Anderson wrote and directed the movie, which co-stars Tyrese Gibson and Ian McShane.<br /><br />The DVD features both the theatrical and an unrated version of the picture, with Anderson and producer Jeremy Bolt delivering audio commentary on the unrated one.  There are also two \\"Making of\\" featurettes.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
0812976525|3.0|Not exaclty what I expected, I was thinking a little bit more humorous muck-raking.  (I was hoping for The Jungle...with Jokes!)  It was not that.  Though the book does gloss over the process that the Special Interests use when developing their stratagies, the book ends up being a contrived office pollitics \\"thirller\\" with the main mystery being too easily solved for me, and the loose ends of his life left way to unresolved.
B001DTUTU8|5.0|HORTON HEARS A WHO! is a charming, fun-filled animated feature, adapted from the story by Dr. Seuss.<br /><br />Horton is a playful elephant who becomes a reluctant hero when he discovers that Who-ville, a microscopic city, exists on a floating speck of dust.  Despite the efforts of the other animals in the mythical jungle to stop him, Horton undertakes a perilous and hilarious journey in order to bring that speck of dust and all its inhabitants to safety.<br /><br />Jim Carrey is a delight as the voice of care-free Horton, as is Steve Carell, who supplies the voice of the mayor of Who-ville, considered to be a bumbling boob by the city council and the town's citizens.  In a \\"Making of\\" featurette on the 2-disc \\"Special Edition\\" DVD from 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment, we see how the ad-libs from these two funnymen often caused the producers to adjust their story.<br /><br />Carol Burnett voices an ultra-conservative kangaroo, who leads the other jungle creatures in an effort to stop Horton from saving Who-ville, and Will Arnett is her nefarious \\"hitman,\\" a vulture.  Amy Poehler, Seth Rogen and Isla Fisher voice other characters.<br /><br />The animation in this feature, directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, is marvelous.  They supply audio commentary, and the package also has a new animated  ICE AGE short, deleted footage, many \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurettes and a digital copy.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I love this album. It has the typical Enya stuff that I both expect and love. Some of my favorite tracks though are the more upbeat numbers. I am especially fond of the song about the toy soldier. It is very sweet and and again has a catchy beat.
B00006ADFL|5.0|HEAVENLY CREATURES is an insane love story. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey's characters burn for each other w/ a blind passion rarely seen on film. Doomed to be apart, and unable to survive separately, the two concoct a sinister (to us) plan to ensure their bond forever (in their world). Both Winslet and Lynskey portray these girls as if they are actually wearing their skins! Played against the backward, self-righteous backdrop of 1950s smalltown New Zealand (Christchurch to be exact), these girls appear to be even more alien. Peter Jackson's version of their interior, \\"fourth world\\" lives is astounding! The living-clay people are seemless. I have no idea how he did it! A complete masterwork of dark fantasy film-making. Even knowing the grim outcome, I still find myself hoping for the impossible to happen, for these girls to be together forever...

0930289234|4.0|Once _The Watchmen_ was labeled the first \\"classic\\" graphic novel, there were sure to be detractors.  Fans of graphic novels coming to Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' text for the first time are going to be surprised at how uninspired the artwork seems, especially when set against the kind of brilliant artwork of more contemporary comics or graphic novels.  So many of the pages are laid out in static, nine-panel sets that the pages sometimes take the feel of the intro credits of \\"The Brady Bunch.\\"<br /><br />And yes, _Watchmen_ puts the novel in graphic novel.  In places it reads like a Mamet play, and it lingers more on the psyche of its super-characters--their phobias and sexual peccadilloes--than on their physical prowess or superpowers.  How moviegoers to the new _Watchmen_ movie will react to the superhero film version of \\"My Dinner with Andre\\" remains to be seen.<br /><br />Despite its failings, Moore and Gibbons' work deserves to be lauded.  For one thing, I can't think of a novel outside of Delillo's _White Noise_ that better made me feel as if I were back in the mid-80s.  Even with Nixon still holding the presidency in the alternate timeline here, this book captures the fear and dread of the Regan years--the still-real fear of atomic destruction and the dread of economic malaise.  Maybe that feel, in light of current economic woes, is what will make the _Watchmen_ move a success.  It should make this graphic novel a work to read and study for years to come.
1741046904|3.0|While I have not purchased or used this guide, I did use the older Lonely Planet guide for Rajasthan, Delhi, and Agra published in 2005 as well as the Rough Guide for the same region. I definitely preferred the Rough Guide.  I've searched inside the new Lonely Planet guide on Amazon and see that it might have some more color and pictures than the old book, but it generally seems similar.  For instance, the new book has less than 2 pages about Fatehpur Sikri while the Rough Guide has 8.  So, I would recommend the Rough Guide book instead.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Excellent, well-produced screenplay and movie.  Sexy without showing  skin.  Thoughtful and relevant, especially for any woman who may be thinking she has to compromise her standards to get the guy.  I highly recommend it!
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I enjoyed this DVD on all levels: the music, the performance, the visuals, and the audio. Gilmour surrounded himself with an excellent cast of musicians (most of whom you'll recognize from other Floyd-related videos) along with fellow Floydian Richard Wright, plus the guest vocals by David Crosby and Graham Nash along with David Bowie's appearance on a couple encores all fit in well.<br /><br />Along with excerpts from \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and other standard Floyd fare, Gilmour's latest album \\"On an Island\\" was performed in its entirety, and some of the his/Floyd's less performed works were also presented to great effect. My personal favorite on this disc is \\"Echos\\" which simply blew me away.<br /><br />The bonus tracks were quite good and the tour documentary video was generally interesting if a bit rambling. All in all a great package and one which will never spend very long on my shelf gathering dust. My only gripe (and it's only here in the tiny hope that concert video editors might read it) is the usual penchant of concert video editors to over-edit with way too many cuts and too many extreme close-ups, making it impossible for the viewer to truly get a feel as to what the actual stage show looked like.
B000O1799U|5.0|If they were alive today I am quite sure that Rogers and Hammerstein, Loerner and Lowe and all the others who brought us the great American musicals of the 1940's and 1950's would stand up and cheer for \\"Dreamgirls\\".  For this is a film steeped in the tradition of those fabulous M-G-M musicals of days gone by.  Executive Producer Patricia Whitcher pushed all of the right buttons in assembling an incredibly talented ensemble that makes \\"Dreamgirls\\" one of the finest musicals of the past quarter century.<br /><br />As most people know, \\"Dreamgirls\\" is loosely based on the story of Berry Gordy's Motown records and the popular 1960's girl group The Supremes.  The star-studded cast includes Eddie Murphy in what just might be the finest performance of his career, the multi-talented Jamie Fox,  Beyonce Knowles and Jennifer Hudson who earned herself an Acadamy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of Effie White.  Those of you who are not familiar with the meteoric rise of Gordy's Motown empire in the early 1960's will get yourself a pretty good history lesson here.  The rest of us can focus on the splendid acting performances by just about everyone involved.  What can you say about the musical score for this film?  SImply outstanding!  Among the tunes I enjoyed the most were \\"Patience\\", \\"I Miss You Old Friend\\"  and Jennifer Hudson's remarkable performance on a pair of tunes \\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\\" and most of all  \\"One Night Only\\".  Add to this mix the terrific choreography throughout \\"Dreamgirls\\" and what you have is one thoroughly enjoyable motion picture experience.  Frankly, I thought that the first 30 minutes or so of \\"Dreamgirls\\" was rather ordinary. Perhaps this is a consequence of the film losing something in the translation from the original stage show.  But the film rapidly gains momentum after that and ends in a flourish. I must admit that I am disappointed that I missed seeing \\"Dreamgirls\\" on the big screen but this is a flick that I am definitely going to want to see again.  Kudos to everyone involved!  Very highly recommended!definitely going to want to see again.  Kudos to everyone involved!  Very highly recommended!
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Though no \\"A Man for all Seasons\\" by any stretch of the imagination, Justin Chadwick`s \\"The Other Boleyn Girl\\" is a handsomely mounted, reasonably entertaining soap opera set in the politically-charged court of King Henry VIII.<br /><br />Based on the highly fictionalized and speculative novel by Phillipa Gregory, the movie chronicles the 16th Century catfight between the two Boleyn sisters - the more famous one, Anne, whose marriage to the divorced king resulted in England's final rupture with the Church of Rome (and the eventual loss of her own head when she, like his first wife Catherine, could not provide him with a male heir), and the lesser known, already married Mary who, at least as portrayed in this film, was every bit as attractive to the king as the sister who would eventually win his hand.<br /><br />The Peter Morgan screenplay reduces the complex historical events to the level of a Harlequin Romance, pitting the two sisters against one another in a competition for the king's affections.  All of this is of considerably less interest than the almost ruthless, behind-the-scenes machinations undertaken by the girls' family to groom them as concubines for the crass purpose of currying royal favor.  In fact, it is when the movie touches on the mores of the time and of life at court that it is at its most compelling.<br /><br />Natalie Portman, Scarlett Johansson and Eric Bana all seem to be having great fun playing at dress-up, but the richest performances are delivered by Mark Rylance and David Morrissey as the girls' calculating father and uncle respectively, and Kristin Scott Thomas as their levelheaded, pragmatic mother, helpless to prevent the tragedy that was doomed to engulf her family.<br /><br />The costumes and settings are nothing short of sensational, and they alone maintain our interest even when the scriptwriting fails to live up to the level of its subject.

0060755598|5.0|I'm an entrepreneur and didn't even know it. I'm the front man in an alternative rock band. This book helped me turn my expensive hobby into a business that may actually support the lifestyle I always dreamed about. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Read it with an open mind... just read it!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Regarding most of the 391 reviews written before this one, mostly I'd say \\"what they said.\\" I just wanted to stress that the second part involving humans is good too--particularly the way the captain grows a backbone. That was an unexpected revelation, since by that point the viewer has become so focused on WALL-E and EVE.<br /><br />My only criticism stems from the fact that we saw \\"Bolt\\" in 3D the day after seeing WALL-E at home on our big screen (fortunately we have a 120Hz refresh rate LCD TV so it was able to keep up with the action). Anyway, \\"Bolt\\"'s 3D animation sets a new standard of naturalness, and I doubt it can be retrofitted to existing films. So \\"WALL-E\\" may come to be known the way the last of the great silent films were known just before the introduction of talkies. Or the way the last of the great black & white films were know before color became common and high quality back in the 50s.<br /><br />Yes, \\"Bolt\\"'s 3D is that good.<br /><br />Apart from that my recommendation is that if you haven't seen WALL-E yet and don't know every turn of the plot, at the very least you know by now that this is one of the best films of the year, both for kids and adults. So try to see it as \\"virginally\\" as you can. Read the reviews after you've seen the film, since so many are full of spoilers.<br /><br />One more thing--this is one of those films where stuff happens during the end credits. So keep watching until the very very end. You'll be glad you did.
079074404X|4.0|This movie is one hour and 38 minutes long and was released on March 15, 1956. Since this movie is based on Shakespeare's The Tempest, a book I never read, I cannot do a compare and contrast. In the movie, you can see some effects that Star Trek used in its television show. Basically the movie is set in the year 2200 and a group of soldies is sent to the planet Altair IV to find out what happen to a group of scientists who try to colonize the planet 20 years ago. Once the expedition reaches the planet reaches the planet the find the three remaining survivors. Robby The Robot, Dr. Edward Morbius, and Altaira \\"Alta\\" Morbius. Murders start turning up when an invsible creature start attacking the crew. The movie does have some laughs and tries to make a statement. I would recommend this movie to any. Just for the special effects alone.
B001CTDH76|4.0|This TV show, in its first season, is, like \\"Life,\\" a police procedural with lots of flavor--in this case, a former phony psychic who, years ago, talking insultingly about a serial killer on his psychic TV show.<br /><br />The killer was watching the show, apparently, took offense, and proceeded to murder the guy's entire family.<br /><br />After much soul searching, our hero quit his pseudoprofession and now works with a police agency doing for crimes what Gregory House does for his hospital--solving the cases no one else can solve. He uses his ability to read people and situations that stood him in good stead during his stint as a phony psychic.<br /><br />Of course, like the cop in \\"Life\\" his merry, mischievous exterior conceals an iron core of permanent, near-psychotic rage. The Mentalist works with the police agency he works for in order to find the serial killer to killed his family, and he has told his boss there, in merry seriousness, that if/when he finds the guy, he will take him apart in a way Dexter (as in the HBO series) would admire.<br /><br />All this is backstory. No spoilers, as I promised. There's considerable interaction with his boss, her boss, and the three person team that also works with the boss, and they're all competently played, seemingly pretty much credible as detectives.<br /><br />So both this and \\"Life\\" have:<br /><br />1. fine actor in the lead role--with \\"The Mentalist,\\" Aussie heartthrob Simon Baker, who every woman appears to find irresistable (according to my wife).<br /><br />2. multilayered plot, with an ongoing story arc on top of the case du jour, and evolving relationships among the team members.<br /><br />3. light and shadow--lots of comic moments alongside very dark stuff indeed. In painting this would be called chiaroscuro (think Rembrandt paintings of interiors illuminated by candles).<br /><br />If you like \\"Life\\" I'm certain you'll like \\"The Mentalist\\" even if the more run of the mill procedurals (all the CSIs for example) don't appeal to you. I'd also put \\"Bones\\" in this category FWIW.<br /><br />And this is about as good as we can expect until Joss Whedon's next show shows up (presumably \\"Dollhouse\\" with Eliza Dushku, herself a master of chiaroscuro).W.

Start from the beginning and you'll fall in love with Dexter, his beloved and brilliantly hilarious and crass sister Deb, and the cast and crew that is so fantastic, ... they're delicious.  I've had so much fun watching this show that I wonder if its just me, or am I crazed to find this show so enjoyable despite its crass and crude subject matter.  But there's so much truth to this show, ... we all wear a mask, and we all act out, ... it's just what's acceptable versus what's not that begs the question.      Check this out, ...

B00006GO9Q|5.0|I've been a long time 'music' fan who for some reason, never really felt the need to explore jazz.  I do listen to alot of metal though, and quite a few bands have a jazzy bend to them--even some of the ones that almost shun what most people would call melody.  I also listened to alot of industrial in my day, and the best bands really had a jazz mindset when they wrote.  (Not in tonality, but in the free-form nature of most of the compositions.)<br /><br />I've always known the name Miles Davis, and thought I should give him a listen after searching \\"jazz fusion\\" on wikipedia, and am I ever glad I did.  My first album was bitches' brew and having found that during a prolonged session of study for combinatorics, I found the music absolutely stunning as I rewove my ways through some tough theorems.<br /><br />So I went out and bought this one right away.  It seems that some in the jazz community have a love/or/hate relationship with these two Miles records, but I've got nothing but love and respect.  He conjures a mood, which is often more powerful IMHO than writing a memorable hook or melody. More importantly, I'm now a proud jazz/fusion lover, and look forward to uncovering this music as the years roll by.
B000P12LWY|1.0|Showtime's obviously expensive production of \\"The Tudors\\" has got its first season into circulation as a set of DVDs.  I have seen some advertising on this, and my first reaction was that any series portraying Henry VIII as a lean man with black hair can't be all good.  The truth turns out to be worse.  It would take a few days of solid research to plumb the depths of this historically ludicrous series.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is this:  if you expect to learn much about Tudor history, don't turn to this historical travesty.  Let's start with the most basic fact:  Henry VIII had red hair.  This is no deep secret; it is one of the best-known facts in English history.  The British have certainly got it right in their TV series - how did the people responsible for \\"The Tudors\\" miss it?  Amazingly, the right actor was right under their noses:  Steven Waddington, who played the (3rd) Duke of Buckingham, is not only red-haired, but looks a heck of a lot more like Henry than Rhys Meyers and also has more the right build for the role.  Rhys Meyers is certainly a delicious bit of eye candy, and often gets down to at least 1 button below the top of his shorts, but he is far too lithe to be a convincing Henry.  Henry's eating habits had already given him something of a paunch by the time he was getting the hots for Anne Boleyn.<br /><br />Before we continue with the bad news, we can consider the good.  First of all, the sets and costumes are very good.  True, Rhys Meyers is rather less overdressed than Henry VIII typically was.  But overall, the sumptuousness of Tudor dress and architecture is well shown and gives the series a gorgeous look that makes us want to believe there's some attempt here at historical accuracy - which there isn't.<br /><br />The acting in the series is professional if not exactly thrilling.  Even Sam Neill, as Cardinal Woolsey (a name various spelt in the sources) seems fairly subdued.  It's a good cast - just not a great one.<br /><br />The script is fairly well-written - if you can ignore the numerous verbal howlers, usually terms not current in the 16th Century.  The worst is probably the reference of the Field of the Cloth of Gold as a \\"summit\\".  This is a term that had no currency until the later 20th Century and sounds ridiculous in the mouth of Woolsey.  There are other solecisms of this sort, but not quite so awful.  In general, the patois of the English nobility hasn't got any sort of Shakespearian feel to it, and sounds far too modern.  Various epithets, including the \\"f\\" word - a favorite of the vocabulary-challenged, were unlikely to have been in use almost 600 years ago.  We don't at all hear the favorite of the times, \\"'sblood\\".  It would have helped if the producers had had a competent research department.<br /><br />Historical dramas of course have to manufacture a lot - particularly conversations that took place behind closed doors.  Manufacturing lies to replace well-known historical facts, however, is far beyond the Pale.  There is the matter of Henry's sister Margaret.  Now, as it happens, Henry had 2 sisters:  Mary and Margaret.  Mary married the King of France and later Charles Brandon - by whom she became the grandmother of Queen Jane Grey.  Margaret married the King of Scotland and became the mother of James V and grandmother of King James I (and VI).  In the Tudors, there is only 1 sister, Margaret, who marries the King of Portugal and then Charles Brandon.  There is no excuse for this wanton perversion of historical fact.<br /><br />At the end of the first season, Woolsey is arrested and conveyed to the Tower, where he commits suicide by slitting his throat.  What an absolute insult to history and to the man.  Woolsey was indeed arrested, but died of his illnesses before reaching the Tower.  As you may know, the Roman Church takes a dim view (to put it mildly) of suicide, and no good Catholic - much less a prince of the church, would ever consider it.  The version in \\"The Tudors\\" is not only a lie, it is a damned lie.<br /><br />The series goes on like this, casting truth to perdition and lying about the Tudors and their courtiers at every opportunity.  The very name of the series is a lie - how can it be about \\"the Tudors\\" when it ignores Owain Twdwr and barely mentions Henry VII?  The rise of the dynasty is a dramatic tale that somehow gets overshadowed by Henry VIII's highjinks.  I had hopes, when I first heard that this series was coming out, that it would have the good sense to dramatize the background to Henry VIII's reign.  Apparently they would rather ignore the background and lie about the reign.<br /><br />Well, as long as you realize this is almost a complete fiction, enjoy it.  It's a good bit of mindless entertainment, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.
0545128285|4.0|This little book was great fun to read. Harry Potter has ended, I never expected more, and suddenly, lo, here is another book about Harry's world--with commentary from Dumbledore! This is not a monumental, complex masterpiece, like the Harry Potter series. It's just a small book of wizard fairy tales. The tales are short, simple, and funny, yes, even the somewhat gory one, and Dumbledore's commentary is just what one would expect from him/Rowling. It will be appreciated by anyone who misses Harry Potter, and I'm so glad that Rowling decided to create these tales for us. It sits on the shelf beside the full series, my collection of Roald Dahl, B.B. Wurge's delightful kids' book, and of course A.A. Milne's books, which are just as funny and wacky as the former, for all their classic status. Rowling's imagination stands with any of the above, and that's high praise. Don't let the negative reviews of this book deter you.
031606792X|5.0|It probably doesn't matter at this point, but this review does contain spoilers.    I wrote most of this in a response to someone's negative review but I wanted to show my support for this story and the way to do that here is to write a review and rate the item.    Perhaps it's because I'm male, and perhaps it's because I'm 30 and I'm not looking for something unexpected and mysterious or tragic.  I thought the book was fantastic, and I just can't really understand the negative reviews of this story, when these same people claim the loved the last three books in the series.    I got sucked into the Twilight series when the movie came out and my mother and sister were going to see it. I decided, well, I usually like things having to do with Vampires, and I didn't know much about the story so I went to see it. I immediately liked it. My mother had bought a set of all four books so I started reading, and I was hooked.    It took all of two weeks to read the first three books, and over this past weekend I read Breaking Dawn.  I had to buy New Moon on paperback because my mother had lent it to someone at work.    I'd been hoping throughout the first three books that Bella would finally become what she wanted (and what Edward DID want, even though he didn't want to \\"steal\\" Bella away from humanity) - to become a vampire. I had a suspicion that this would happen in this book but I was afraid that it would be the last paragraph of the story or something ridiculous like that.   Like so many stories and movies.   That doesn't happen here.    At first I was a bit indifferent to the story. I enjoy the relationship between Edward and Bella but I wasn't too crazy about the baby idea. But then it got interesting. After the first few chapters, and all through the Jacob book, I just couldn't put the book down. Bella became what she wanted halfway through the story and her experiences were able to be touched upon with some depth.  I was VERY glad about that.    Sure, I could find some things to complain about here if I try. The book is about 750 pages and there just seems to be so much more that could have been said, but you just can't make a 1000 page book!  (Well, I wish she had.  Stephanie Meyer is always saying that she gets too carried away and writes too much and I love that about her.)  But, I can't complain much. I guess my biggest complaint is that the book seems a little too perfect; in that everything I wanted to see happen, DID happen. I was as if I were writing the story.  That isn't much of a complaint, I agree.      What's not to like?  The happy ending?  And then I think about that - why not have a happy ending? It's a fantasy world to begin with. Why not?    A lot of people today don't seem to be happy with happy endings.    Too many of the negative comments here revolve around that - that the ending was happy and that's somehow bad. What had to be sacrificed? Why should something have to be sacrificed? Bella fought and scratched and clawed her way to what she wanted. The last thing that she would have been willing to live with was happiness for herself if it cost the happiness of others. Through four books she was unwilling to let that happen and in the end, she was rewarded for that - she was able to somehow maintain happiness in others and have it for herself as well.  I think the happy ending in Breaking Dawn is plausible.   That's what I love so much about Science Fiction and Fantasy.  You're only limited by the imagination.    There's a lot of open doors left at the end of this book and I do believe that the author will continue the story in some form or another.  I believe her when she says he has a lot invested in these characters, and you can see that very much as these stories progress.  There can be a lot of interesting directions to take the story from here, and I really can't wait to see what's coming.    I think the book was a great ending to this series and my only true problem with the book is that it ended at all.   Perhaps that's one of the real reasons for any discord.  People maybe seem unhappy because the book just seems so.. final?   I didn't see it that way; there's loose ends all over, but I can see that point of view if I try.  Maybe I didn't see as big a difference in the characters because I read all four books in such rapid succession?  Maybe I didn't warp things as much - as we all tend to do - to my own sense of who they are?    I'm definitely a late comer to the Twilight series, but I was lucky enough to discover it after all four books had been published.   I eagerly await the next movie (scheduled to release on my birthday, to boot) and I hope we really do see the entire saga put to the screen.    Stephanie Meyer is a monster of a writer - able to put out this entire series of books in just a few years.   She's the third female writer that really interests me (there's just not a lot of women doing SciFi or Fantasy) and I look forward to what she does next - especially if it's set in the Twilight world!

B000BCKFWK|5.0|I love this movie--have seen it maybe 15 times already. Time to buy it!It is full of philosophy and action. It is never boring. The film noir style works perfectly for this genre (graphic novel) and the quality of acting, directing and writing is evident. There is also plenty of eye-candy for boys and girls alike. It is intensely creative. It is also extremely violent and perverse--not for the very young or those unused to extreme violence. I recently saw The Spirit, another film by Frank Miller and it cannot compare to Sin City. It is the very best of the genre.
159448385X|5.0|This book is so moving and so vivid.  I could not put it down and I think I finished it in less than 24 hours, much like the Kite Runner, and could not tell people to read it fast enough.  I noticed one reviewer said it was too sad given our world today--yes it is a very sad story but to think that people live this sort of life and go on puts so many things into perspective.  Hosseini writes beautifully and with such detail that you can begin to envision a culture that most of us will never see first hand.  It is worth every minute you spend reading it and more!
B0013FSL3E|2.0|Very disappointing. I found it boring and had a hard time sitting through the whole thing. The basic plot may have some content and a hint of morality with its warnings about trashing planet earth, but it comes through as a slow moving sequence of images with no meaningful dialogue. Having said that my 3-year old still likes it.  The cardboard DVD case is also flimsy and would not last long in a household with children.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|I received this as a Christmas present. I think this movie is very funny! It has an awesome plot and very good actors! When 4 snobby actors try to make an action war film, they all screw up, so the writer of the book of the film they are making suggest to take the actors into the jungles of Vietnam to make them see what it's really like. They run into a heroin factory who kidnap Tugg Speedman and hold him hostage and make him perform as a 'special' kid in a movie he did a long time ago. Will the actors make it out alive? I highly suggest TROPIC THUNDER!!!
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|James McAvoy is excellent in this suspense - action thriller that really delivers some heart-pounding, and gripping-the-seat-intensity throughout the entire 110 minutes of movie madness!  The negative reviews of this film are just jealous they did not write, produce, and direct such a cinematic wonder!<br /><br />People want to be more than the sum of their life as a whole, but how many of us step up to become the impossible hero or the unbelievable villain.  This is a fantasy movie that combines all the possibilities of becoming something impossible and then throws that out of the screen and into your lap.  This is not a film to be judged as compared to other films.  It is a film that stands on its own merits - it creates a whole new genre.<br /><br />This is one of Angelina Jolie's best performances to date, because she had to be both superhero and vulnerable woman at the same time.  She (Fox) manages to feign apathy while convincing the audience that she is truly concerned with teaching McAvoy (Wesley) how to be an able-bodied assassin.<br /><br />I've seen some bad reviews of this film, so I went back and watched it again. I don't see anything lacking in the movie after a second viewing.  Morgan Freeman doesn't involve himself with bad scripts...and he certainly did not start with this one!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, if you don't own Wanted, buy it here and now.  You won't be sorry!<br />The 2-DVD set is the best deal and worth the cost!<br /><br />See ya next review!
B000002UAU|4.0|Though groundbreaking and influential in many respects, \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is far from the conceptual, free-flowing image it may project. In fact, it could be argued that the Beatles' eighth studio album is a bit choppy in spots, with little rhyme or reason in terms of subject and sound. Nonetheless, the band should be commended for its studio experimentation and range of diverse noises within each unique song. What started as a potentially gimmicky idea by Paul McCartney, in the eyes of his three band mates, ended up being a critically acclaimed and monumental release by an already larger-than-life band from the 1960s.<br /><br />Paul's idea was to record music as the Beatles but release the new album under the band name Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Accompanying the slaved-over music -- which would take five months to perfect in the studio -- was a splashy album cover and bonus Beatles paraphernalia that was included with the record to satiate salivating Beatles fans, many of whom felt the band had become way too isolated for its own good by the time the Summer of Love rolled around in 1967.<br /><br />The first three songs on \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" are alone worth the price of admission, and at the start, it does indeed feel like a concept album. True to the album's intent, the enthusiastic title-track opener, sung with gusto by McCartney, feels like the beginning of something fresh, spunky and experimental. In some ways, it IS like listening to a band other than the Beatles. Far from being farcical, as some of the other Beatles may have feared, McCartney's infectiousness is contagious at the start. Interestingly, the following song, \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" sung mournfully by Ringo Starr, is an entirely different entity; it stands as a perfect come-down, a warning that not all is bliss on the record.<br /><br />The hazy atmosphere of drugs abounds on this album, starting with the eerie, isolated and high-pitched keyboard on \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\\" Though the song eventually emerges into a tuneful sing-along, Lennon's equally filtered and unnatural voice and lyrics are in lock step with the trippy images he dreamily sings about. Though his contributions to \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" were invaluable, Lennon was said to be drugged to the max during its creation, at times nearly catatonic in nature. By contrast, his cohort McCartney, though also partaking heavily in his share of \\"downers,\\" warmed up for numerous \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" sessions with cocaine, paving the way for a remarkable contrast in moods, singing styles and attitudes throughout the record's journey.<br /><br />Some of this stuff is pure Beatles pop, conventional and safe. \\"Getting Better,\\" for instance, was at one time featured in TV commercials (for a TV brand, I think). Though the lyrics on \\"Getting Better\\" are surprisingly introspective and frank (\\"I used to be cruel to my woman/I'd beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved\\"), the sound is upbeat, familiar and friendly. Elsewhere, McCartney is positively stately sounding on such gems as the beautiful \\"She's Leaving Home,\\" the upbeat \\"Lovely Rita\\" and the innocent-sounding \\"When I'm Sixty-Four.\\"<br /><br />A few laborious swerves on the record include Lennon's somewhat contrived-sounding \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\" and George Harrison's droning, sitar-laced \\"Within You Without You,\\" which, to its credit, does include a pertinent message about the ultimate unimportance and mortality of humans. Though Harrison's tune strives for a never-ending deepness, a far more interesting and trippy time occurs on the epic Lennon/McCartney closer, \\"A Day in the Life,\\" which smoothly veers from Lennon's faraway annunciations (\\"I read the news today, oh boy\\") to McCartney's snappy dialogue (\\"Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head).<br /><br />Undoubtedly, from top to bottom, \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" boasts innovative sounds from the Beatles that helped change the musical landscape. Trumpets and piano usurp Harrison's feisty guitar licks; Lennon shows up in a fog; Ringo obediently lends his hand; and much of the project has a movielike feel, thanks to McCartney's bountiful energy and producer George Martin's studio mastery.Harrison's feisty guitar licks; Lennon shows up in a fog; Ringo obediently lends his hand; and much of the project has a movielike feel, thanks to McCartney's bountiful energy and producer George Martin's studio mastery.

0312379293|5.0|To start, I have read on average 52-60 novels per year for the past 17 years.  That's an average.  I started reading this book a little over a week ago and just finished it.  Obviously, the second someone is done with a book is not always the most objective time to review a book but I just couldn't wait.    I'll assume you know the plot line and the players.  Just think Count of Monte' Cristo meets 'Any John Grisham book' meets Wallstreet (movie) meets Shawshank Redemption.  You get the idea.    It has everything and it is done in a very proper and respectful English manner and it is done perfectly.  Right this second, out of nearly 1000 books it is my #2.  That's got to stand for something.
1574241451|4.0|An essential book to Know Gibson ES335 and family.  Complete and full of interesting information.  It may takes time to get all the dates it provides.  If you´ve got a 335 or you´re thinking getting one, this book is a must!
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|While the \\"becoming Batman\\" parts of \\"Batman Begins\\" were a welcome addition to the Batman canon, this one pales in comparison to the Tim Burton Batmans. Burton's had much more character development, and a lesser body count. The Burton ones cinematography and set were much more \\"other worldly\\" and interesting. While this one had better technology, the effects got to be headache-inducing in it's overlong 2 1/2 hours. I also prefer Michael Keaton/Jack Nicholson to Bale/Ledger, and the Danny Elfman score for the Burton movies was preferable of course.    While they are huge box office hits, I really wish Hollywood would stop regurgitating Batmans/Hulks/etc. with better effects but less nuance, and writing something original!

B00005S6K8|5.0|I loved the original with Bogart and this one was well made and sticking to the original beautifully.
0143036556|4.0|First, let me say the real score I'd want to give this book is a 3.5 or 3.75.     First, on a more superficial level, it could have used another round or two of editing. There are multiple occasions where he hammers home the same point multiple times for the same culture, particularly in Chapters 6-8 dealing with the Greenland Norse. This book could have been slimmer by a solid 40-50 pages without losing much.    Also, he rarely cites his sources directly in the text, often just referring to researcher names. The \\"Further Reading\\" section lists many of the sources he used but is incomplete and for the most part doesn't given the specific content/pages for the information he's using. This is a real shame, especially given the high degree of scrutiny the book has received. I imagine the choice was probably motivated by a desire for the book to appeal to the masses more, but it also damages the book's ability to back up its claims. Also, I think it can allow the author to be sloppier with his analyses and conclusions.    This book, on the whole, is a very worthwhile and compelling read. The explanation of possible collapses is engaging and relevant to our world. Overall, I think he does an excellent job of giving plausible reasons for why past collapses have had large environmental causes. The comparisons between Haiti and the Dominican Republic, as well as the further explanation behind the Rwanda genocide, were especially illuminating. He uses a lot of actual data that is hard to argue with and gives enough evidence and reason to support importance of being good caretakers of our environment, for both the present and the future. He also uses his own experiences to serve as useful examples of his larger themes.     There are flaws. A few times when something was in dispute or not clear based on the available evidence, he leaned toward environmental reasons that supported his thesis. Often he would interject that some of it was merely his speculation, but countering views were not always addressed fairly (though many were). This may have as much to do with Diamond as it does with the demand of audiences and publishers to have focused books that don't allow for too many perceived uncertainties (more a problem with popular science non-fiction than with research journals and the like).    Overall though, I felt he was as objective as a biased person can be. I don't mean that as an insult but a compliment. He clearly is on the side of environmental concerns but I think he was about as objective as someone can be when they passionately fall on one side of an issue. For a counterexample of that, I recall a review that claimed Diamond was constantly bashing Bush towards the end of the book, but in fact he only brought him up directly one time that I recall (the 90-day perspective).    There are a few areas of his research that raises questions as to the validity of some of his claims. In particular, some of his claims about Australia. See [...]%2016-3+4_Marohasy.pdf and [...] for further details, though be skeptical about some of those claims as well. For example, Marohasy claims Diamond says in \\"Collapse\\" that Australia imports most of its food (which it does not). However, Diamond did not claim that, as on page 395 he writes \\"Australia produces more food than it consumes and is a net food exporter.\\" There are some other inconsistencies/errors in Marohasy's work but she does indeed point out some of Diamond's errors as well.     Also, about Easter Island, see: [...]%2016-34_Peiser.pdf which includes many of the objections to Diamond's version of events. I find this paper to be much more dubious than Marohasy's, as it is very aggressively argued and contains less scientific data. Additionally, the author claims cannibalism is a myth of European fear, but there is some potential (not overwhelming by any means) evidence for cannibalism on Easter Island that he ignores, as well as much more conclusive evidence in other cultures that cannibalism does not result only out of isolated pockets of desperation, all of which he denies. He also criticizes Diamond for relying on oral histories and early European reports, then goes on to do the same thing when it suits his goals. However, some of his points and the research he uses is reason for skepticism about the collapse of Easter Island.    About the photosynthetic ceiling which Diamond briefly brings up in Chapter 15, this is a good and reasonable rebuttal: [...] that shows that much of Diamond's reasoning and extrapolations are rather flawed about this detail.    I bring up these examples so that people can explore differing data and explanations of similar data and also to reinforce the fact that gathering evidence and making it fit coherently is difficult. Diamond is incorporating an immense amount of data into a large thesis and so I think one should not expect him to be perfect nor to dismiss him because of some errors.     So, in short, read this book. It's important and I think makes a largely supported and valid case that we need to pay greater attention to our environment or else we will suffer in the future. But don't accept everything at face value and do seek out other explanations (and question those as well); the Internet is a very valuable resource. One can't possibly investigate every detail and every source, but some effort in this regard will pay off in a more balanced perspective. I say try to step away from the us versus them dichotomy that seems to afflict many reviews of this book as well as interpretations/analyses of this book. As often is the case, the truth is nebulous but rarely centered at either extreme.

B001GM28HO|3.0|I really like the song \\"Just Dance\\", but I think I was expecting too much from this CD. I was a little disappointed in a couple songs because its a bit over the top and stupid, for example \\"Paparazzi\\". I think this CD is more for the club, but I was hoping for a more unique sound. I occasionally listen to it, but I am not crazy about it.
B00008RH3L|4.0|I have been wanting to see this film ever since I read my evil twin's review on this film. I'm always game for a great gangster movie and for the most part 'Miller's Crossing' delivers. The film starts a bit slow and the characters seemed to be a little stereotypical for my taste, but by the second half the film comes together for a worthwhile finale!<br /><br />This film is like a cross between 'The Cotton Club' and 'The Sting'! It's really quite different as far as gangster films go and this might have caused me to feel the film was a slow starter. If you've passed this one by, you might want to give it a shot! It's a worthy entry in the great gangster film club. The DVD transfer is very good.
1580495796|5.0|I have read this story before when I was younger. I like the way this book is formatted though. Its a easy story to read and understand. I like how it gives a message of appreciation to the simple stuff in life and to not take everything for granted. I really love reading this during the holidays.
1401207529|5.0|Definitely a different, almost noir feel to Batman, perhaps the star in this is Jim Gordon - who is also the most tainted in this newer approach.<br /><br />A well told tale that might not be good for canon but definitely works here. These are men who are willing to compromise on some level in their battle for good, but Miller gives us a world where maybe that is the only way to achieve some level of justice.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I have always liked Gorillaz music since the song \\"Clint Eastwood\\". This CD is great to go cruising around with or just to have in the background to keep the energy going.

1416575464|5.0|This book was easy to find and was a gift for christmas.  recieved it ust a few days.  she loved and was excited about the contents.  I glanced at it and got afew ideas myself from the book. thank you
044024238X|3.0|I received this book along with Sophie Kinsella's other book Can You Keep a Secret for Christmas.  I have previously enjoyed the Shopaholic series, as well as Remember Me?  Ms Kinsella is a talented writer and always keeps her audience captivated with light hearted and far fetched tales.  However, of the two I just received, I would highly recommend Can You Keep a Secret? over this one.  This story was a lot more interesting than I was expecting from the book jacket, however the last 75 pages or so took a turn for the worst.  Up to that point Samantha Sweeting was a likeable character despite running from her problems.  Unfortunately, her actions, indecisivness and plain flakieness ruined her character, the ending left far too much open and gave no real conclusion for Samantha as well as the supporting characters who were quite likeable throughout the story.
0385340540|3.0|The Broker by John Grisham is a nice and fun read. In full disclosure, I must admit that I have a soft spot for Mr. Grisham's writing. Having said that, this book had some real issues. Mostly, The Broker is a good fun read but you must keep your hand pressed firmly on the \\"I Believe Button\\" for most of the book.     Like many Grisham books, The Broker is about a fish out of water in an impossible situation. Joel Backman is a former lobbyist who must now face the full fury of the Federal government at its most devious. Without money, reputation, or high powered friends, Backman must start over with a new name, language, and identity. It is a good story.     However, there are some real problems with this book. First, the entire plot is driven by the inability or unwillingness of the CIA to kill an American citizen. Yet, one of the early sequences in the novel is one where the CIA kills a former political advisor to the President. Second, the book has a Major as the head of the DIA.  A Major is a relatively junior officer.  Normally, the DIA is led by a three star General or Admiral.     Overall, this is a good book for the beach or a plane ride. Don't expect it to be realistic, accurate, or great literarature.

B000ETQR3Q|1.0|this was [...] bucks at target.  It didn't fire as far as any of my nerf guns with or without the extension.  The extensions attatchable grip wouldn't go on to the pistol and it wouldn't fire.  If you were standing 5 feet from the wall and fired looking through the scope the dart woul've  already lost 5 feet altitude.  Don't buy this IT DOESNT WORK.  Notice how in the commercial they show an animation of it not it actually firing and the distance isn't showed.
B001BGTWXI|2.0|I need to listen again to truly get a grip of this album, but I am pretty sure I am really disappointed. Not Metallic's Black album disappointed, but nonetheless.    Solos for the sake of solos SUCKS! There have been very few well placed solos (Sepultura \\"Territory\\" comes to mind), so most just makes want to cringe. That's just me.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Being of the Jewish faith, I was a little hesitant to buy this album, knowing it was suppose to be an Christmas inspired album.  However, also being an avid Enya fan, I decided to buy this album and listen to it with an open mind.  And I am so glad I did.  Not only did this album not sound like a commercialized Christmas album, it reminded me of the music Enya had done on her first four or five albums.  Even though there are some references to Christmas, they are few and far between.  No Enya fan will be disappointed in this album.  The melodies are very well layered, very lush and simply heavenly to listen to.  As one of the previous posters said, only one song caught me by surprise and that was \\"My, My Time Flies!\\", but it surprised me in a very good way.  I love every song on this album, but my favorites are \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\", \\"Dreams are more Precisous\\", \\"Last Time by Moonlight\\", \\"One Toy Soldier\\" and of course \\"My, My, Time Flies!\\".  Overall, this is a great album for any time of the year.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Without a doubt, this is the best action-hero movie to date. That being said, I'm not rating the movie, only the audio transfer to DVD. I'm very disappointed that there aren't any audio options. I'm sure if you're into the whole home-theater scene, and don't have to worry about waking the kiddies, life is good.    However, there are those of us who only have the run-of-the-mill TV and DVD player. The audio transfer is such that the bass frequencies are so low that the TV speakers are constantly breaking up. Running it through the stereo eliminates the low frequency problem with the TV, but opens up a whole new can of worms. If you turn it up so you can hear the dialogue, when the action scenes come on, it shakes the walls. This happened with the bass turned all the way down, treble turned all the way up and the sub-sonic filter on.    Granted, getting blown out of my seat at the theater was great, but at home it would be nice to have a choice between 2.1, 5.1 stereo, etc. or remix the audio for the digital transfer so that the dialogue and action/pyro-technics are more in proportion (as has been done on every other DVD I own). It's hard to enjoy the movie when you have the volume set so the gun-play is at a dull roar but then you can barely understand the dialogue.
B000ATQYT2|1.0|I own the VHS version of The Muppet Christmas Carol and have been thinking about upgrading to the DVD version, since VCRs are going the way of the 8-track tape. I've discovered from these reviews that for some unexplained reason, the DVD is missing a song, a key plot point that turns Scrooge scroogey (when his girlfriend dumps him for being, well, a scrooge). I will buy another VCR before I buy this DVD.
1416562605|3.0|Adiga tells a dark tale of class hatred, smoldering resentment, universal self interest and foul murder. If those things make you smile, this book will make you laugh. I didn't find much humor here. The protagonist, a ruthless sociopath named Balram, schemes his way to commercial success by any means necessary. The story was sad and sordid for me, because I know a few real life Balrams.<br /><br />The critics praise Adigan wth all kinds of superlatives. Adiga is a competent writer, but his story is more common place than the reviewers would have you believe. Do they not know any sociopaths? Do they fail to recognize them?<br /><br />Sociopaths are not very interesting people. The writer who bases a first person novel on one creates some immediate problems. There are no sympathetic characters herein. A sociopath cannot describe a sympathetic character, unless there was something in it for them. They only see other people as a means to an end, or an obstacle to that end. Adiga stays faithful to Balram's character, showing you the world through his eyes. It is a bleak, depressing place, devoid of faith, hope or love.<br /><br />The author reaches for universal themes, but cannot illuminate them from his self imposed point of view. I admit the writer's talent, but I do not consider this novel worthy of the prize. If he had told some universal truths in an artful way, I could put up with the lack of positive aspects to this tale. He did not.

1594201927|4.0|We are all experts when it comes to money (or at least real estate), but none of us really knows much history.  For if we knew the history of booms and busts, bonds and equities, risk and insurance then we may all be a little less likely to jump into the latest bubble, and a little more likely to question our own \\"expertise\\".  I admire Ferguson for taking on a big topic, and for his willingness to provide a grand sweep of history that reflects and helps us understand our current recession.  The book was apparently written to accompany a documentary series, and it certainly reads that way.  This is good and bad...and the narrative moves along quickly and big lessons are drawn - while at times leaving the reader wanting more analysis.   One question that the author poses keeps coming back to me - have we been living through a \\"super bubble\\" from the 1950s to today, which will see a slow deflation in our lifetimes as property values stagnate and China is no longer willing to fund our consumption through their savings?       Grade:  B+
0140544518|5.0|I read this book aloud at my kindergarten graduation (we did a play with the 3 little wolves and this story worked together) and after watching the video of that recently it reminded me of how much I loved this story and I think because of stories like this and the 3 little wolves story I learned to think outside the box and love things that aren't the norm.  I encourage any parent to read this book to their children as it is a great story that was really funny and definitely made me think of things differently than everyone else sees them.

This one is longer and more boring, and the clones at the end, that was even worse. This is not resident evil, this is a bad mix between mad max and whatever they could think of.

If you like a good story, try it.  You won't be disappointed.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|I was expecting to be incredibly impressed going into this movie, and all I can say is that it completely exceeded my all expectations. I staggered out of the theater, completely blown away by this intelligent, exciting, technically impressive, well-acted, emotional, psychologically gripping piece of cinema. \\"The Dark Knight\\" transcends the \\"superhero movie\\" genre and breaks through to a higher plane. My new favorite movie.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I must admit up front that I didn't enjoy the Broadway show from a story perspective but the music was great. I watched the dvd not expecting anything more from the story but was looking forward to a first class rendition of the songs. The actors and acting are so disconcerting it will be virtually impossible to watch in its entirety for many folks. The vocals are generally horrible and to see Meryl Streep in this movie is like watching a good actor on the Love Boat or Surreal Life...you know their career is over.   Unfortunately, I can't recommend this movie from any point of view and could imagine that even great fans of ABBA would find this embarrassing.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is a beautiful movie about the power of humor to bring hope and protect innocence in the face of unspeakable evil. Roberto Benigni's achievement is incredible: his performance is hilariously endearing, his screenplay brilliant, and his directing wonderfully atmospheric. Truly heartwarming.
B00003CXRM|5.0|A superb cast playing great characters in a quirky take on a classic piece of literature.  George Clooney and John Tuturro turn in another set of solid performances for the Coen's - their movies always are some of the most interesting and entertaining out there.  They always seem to have a very good group of actors in everything they do.    This is a movie I can watch many times and not get tired of.  Fun soundtrack too.
B00069FLC2|5.0|[[ASIN:B00069FLC2 The Shadows - The Final Tour]] When I bought the DVD, I didn't know then that I was going to UK to see Cliff Richard in concert and hear him announce his reunion concert tour next fall with his original backing band, The Shadows.  Great news because their music remains a favorite with millions all over the world!     This DVD shows why The Shadows are the best instrumental group the UK has ever produced.  From the sweet-sounding tunes \\"Sleepwalk, \\"Theme for Young Lovers,\\" \\"Peace Pipe\\" to the fiery \\"Guitar Tango\\" that reminded me of their backing of Cliff's Spanish songs, The Shads' prowess stands out.  The bouncy \\"Foot Tapper\\" brought back my excitement in going to see \\"Summer Holiday\\" as a teenager half a world away, almost half a century ago!      Fantastic tracks!  Superb performance!  The only thing I missed was Cliff's energy on the stage singing \\"In The Country\\" especially.  Maybe that was the number they did when Cliff donned his pink jacket to join them in London on their last concert.      The interview with Hank, Bruce, and Brian, plus the clips of the party after the Londow date were an added treat.  How ironic that Cliff thought he'd never sing with them again.  Five years later, he will!  As one of them said, never say never.    I can't wait to see them in concert!  What a show it'll be!
0192802372|4.0|Emma Woodhouse is an atypical heroine for a Jane Austen novel. Usually, we see disadvantaged girls struggle to find happiness through marriage. In Emma's case, we see a girl who has everything in the world she could want. She is rich, pretty, and happy. She has no desire to be married, as it would interfere with the simple life she enjoys with her father and she knows it would break his heart to be parted from her. The story follows Emma's life beginning at 21 as she tries to help a young girl named Harriet Smith marry above her station. Emma also engages in a flirtation with a young man and generally makes a bit of a mess of things whenever she gets involved.     I have read that Jane Austen felt that Emma was a character only her creator could like. I would have to disagree with that. Emma is certainly flawed, but her heart is almost always in the right place. Pride has blinded her to her own limitations but she is also one who does not shrink from the responsibility of her mistakes and tries very hard to learn from them. I found this admirable and grew to like her more and more as the book progressed.     Aside from Emma, the rest of the cast was also very well written. Her father is a complete hypochondriac and often engages in behavior that would typically be considered highly rude. Yet, he is motivated so completely by a desire to be kind to others that his misguided application of that desire only endears him to the reader. Mr. Knightley, the no-nonsense friend of the family is admittedly not the most complex character in the world, but he is a very good one and his solidity is a great counterbalance to Emma's wishful thinking.     In summary, Emma is a nice change of pace from Jane Austen's other novels. It starts off well and grows more engaging as it continues. The characters are interesting and Emma herself grows considerably during the course of the novel.

0316017922|3.0|Read it if you want a nice read about talent and how practice makes perfect, but don't buy it if you want to learn anything that you can apply or want to be \\"surprised\\".<br /><br />The book is, just like [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink]] and [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point]], entertaining and easy to read and not very applicable. The main difference I think is that the other two gave me more of an Aha!-experience and described phenomena that were unknown to me.
1593082010|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.<br /><br />In summary, this isa great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike.
B000LAZDQA|3.0|I'm not squeamish, I'm not anti-anything, and I accept the human condition to be a bizarre mix of insecurities covered by facades and a yearning for normality.  I went into this film expecting a better rounded mix of sexualities from NYC, and all I got from it was twisted gay love triangles coupled with psychological issues and female orgasmic dysfunction.  I could be wrong, but my opinion is that reviews and descriptions of this film should emphasize that much, if not most, of the film deals with gay issues and sex.  Still interesting from an open minded voyeuristic perspective, but that disclaimer should be there for folks who are expecting otherwise.
1593081251|5.0|The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.<br /><br />While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories of [[ASIN:0743487591 Pride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)]], I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.<br /><br />In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading.
0316172324|3.0|Based around the concept of thin-slicing, this book promotes the idea that your initial thoughts / gut feeling are often the right way to proceed (but not always).  There are many case studies to hammer in the point and look at it from different perspectives.  I feel the concept was a bit oversold, confused, and not pulled together nicely at the end.<br /><br />In terms of the fundamental concept that we can learn to make better and faster decisions when we filter out excess data, I agree.  This particularly holds if you are experienced in the field (i.e. with experience comes intuition).<br /><br />As for the \\"Compelling\\", \\"Astonishing\\" and \\"Brilliant\\" words being used to describe this book, I think that maybe \\"Thought Provoking with Interesting Stories\\" might be a better way to describe it.

1604501480|5.0|Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.<br /><br />Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.<br /><br />This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.<br /><br />As much as I love Pride & Prejudice, I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time.  The [[ASIN:0743487591 Pride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics)]] edition provides helpful footnotes to help readers understand the nuances of the novel more completely.<br /><br />In summary, this is a great novel. Admittedly, there were a few times where I thought a character's behavior was a bit over-the-top but the overall story is so riveting and the book so compelling that I just can't find any serious fault with it. Pride and Prejudice is deserving of its reputation and I highly recommend it to Austen fans and newcomers alike.
B0019EXZY4|4.0|\\"The Bank Job\\" may not be the greatest caper film ever made, but it is definitely a hugely entertaining one--that is, as long as you ignore plot holes and certain elements familiar in the gangster film genre. The heist film's story, reportedly based on the real crime \\"The Baker Street Robbery\\" that happened in London in 1971, is a bit too complicated with subplots about the royal family, corrupt cops, honest cops, a brothel and a political activist, but the fast-paced film is always light and captivating at the same time with the capable British cast.    Jason Statham is Terry Leather, happily married father of two daughters. He is also heavily in debt and needs money now. That is when his former girlfriend Martine Love (Saffron Burrows) shows up before him, offering a lucrative \\"job\\" to him. Actually, Martine has her own motives for supporting him. Little did Terry and his team realize that the bank's vault actually keeps some secrets the robbers really don't want to know.    The plot is full of twists and turns and it keeps a good pace throughout the film's 110 minutes. \\"The Bank Job\\" changes its tone in the second half where things get more tense and violent even though direct descriptions of violence are avoided. The entire cast did a good job, especially David Suchet as a chilling crime lord. Director Roger Donaldson, as in his \\"No Way Out,\\" is a skillful storyteller who manages to keep you interested in the story full of tension and suspense as well as incredible coincidences and plot holes (What happened to negatives?).    Perhaps the film ends too neatly and some parts look implausible. I don't know how much of the story is really \\"based on truth,\\" but \\"The Bank Job\\" is still an interesting and enjoyable ride. And try to spot Mick Jagger who briefly appears.
B00011D1OA|2.0|Although My Fair Lady continues to please people, it does not please me at all.  I must say that I am in the minority.  I saw the film when it first came out, and just a few days ago screened it again.     I want to make it very clear that I love cinema and that I love film musicals.   I say this because I want to assure readers concerning my devotion to the film musical form.  My criticism is that My Fair Lady as a film just doesn't live up to what it could have been.  To me, it is a tragedy that so many lives and dollars were expended to make a film that seems to lacks enthusiasm, warmth, and musicianship.    I find the film version gorgeous to look-at, but that is about all.  The performances and the music interpretation I find to be lacking, even to the instrumentation.  The whole film seems like it is being played as if fulfilling a formula.  Even Rex Harrison seems rather uninterested at times.    And, I will honestly say, that despite all the beautiful costumes and the spectacle, most of the film dramatically is just plain boring.  For someone like myself who loves art films that can move very slowly, this is quite an indicator of how My Fair Lady tragically doesn't inspire or move me.    Last, not using Julie Andrews (who originated the Eliza role on Broadway) was criminal and was quite a scandal at the time of the film's being made.  Only Ms. Andrews could have brought some life to the Eliza role.  While Audrey Hepburn was a great actress, she was not so in this film -- her performance lacks.    Despite the tremendous propaganda from Warner Brothers at the time the film was being made, the product of all that effort falls tremendously flat.  I would suggest that instead of buying or renting the movie, customers should listen to the original cast recording of the original Broadway production.  The singing, the instrumentation, and the artistry are infinitely superior to what is shown in the film.    Julie Andrews has proven her tremendous talent and devotionto her musical and acting craft over the years.  I believe that she should receive Special Recognition from the film community.    An apology from Warner Brothers would also be good for the studio.  WB made a tremendous mistake both artistically and politically in not choosing Julie Andrews.  It is time that WB faces its cruelty to Ms. Andrews, its disrespect for moviegoers, and makes amends to Ms. Andrews as well as to us.  [[ASIN:B000067AS1 My Fair Lady (1956 Original Broadway Cast)]]
B0017ANAZO|3.0|\\"A Female Friendship Film\\" is what I would call \\"The Women\\". A weak remake of the 1939 classic.  I recently rented the DVD (glad I didn't go the movies to see this).  I tried not to compare the  two movies but it was hard not to.  The remake came up short...but if I don't compare them than it is an okay film.  The remake has a totally different feel from the original.  I would describe it as lame!  There is no energy, no drama, no face slapping or cat fights among the women.  They are BORING!  In the 1939 film every woman scratched her way to the top (wearing Jungle Red nail polish).    Meg Ryan (Mary) has made a career in playing \\"good girl\\" roles.  She is good...no surprise there. Annette Benning is also good as Mary's best friend \\"Sylvia\\".  That's the problem...she is much more likable in this film.  Benning's \\"Sylvia\\" would have been much more interesting if she had been bitchier, flawed, with maybe some redemption thrown in at the end.  I did like the scene where Mary and Sylvia made up.  Eva Mendes (Crystal), who is the \\"other woman\\", should have been a BITCH!  She needed to show how conniving she is...a real GOLD DIGGER!  It would have been fun to see her act mean to \\"poor Mary\\".  I got a kick out of Cloris Leachman, as the housekeeper because she can do no wrong in my book.  She has made the best of her acting roles even when the parts were below her standard.     The part that I did not think worked well was \\"Alex\\", Mary's \\"lesbian\\" friend (they had to make a point of making sure you knew she was gay and how the straight friends seem to tolerate it).  Jada Pinkett Smith can't act!  Her role would not have been missed if it had been cut out.  Debi Mazar, who played the gossipy manicurist can't act that well either.  Years ago she had a more interesting look (more severe) than she does now.  Bette Midler was GREAT in her bit part and it would have been greater if it had been BIGGER and she looked better.  They made her look old and tired.  Her talk was even slower.  What a waste ...but hey, it just shows that the Divine Miss M can do older, slower talking, dumpy looking characters...she's versatile!    Diane English wrote and directed this film.  I can tell she is a nice person.  It shows in her film.  A gay man would have done a better job(at least a bitchy gay man).      The ending was dumb.  Come on... Debra Messing (Edie) screaming in agony while giving birth and everyone is running around acting silly.      Would I watch the remake again...no!  Will I watch the 1939 classic...oh yes, again and again!
B00011F5DK|4.0|Blockus is a very strategical game.  I think it is best used with 4 players though.  My family only has 3 players, and I think the game is \\"slower\\" that way.  It takes quite a few plays before the play becomes more difficult, and by then, my 5 year old is a little bored.  She can handle a whole game, though.  I would recommend Blockus, I think the game will become better the more we play and the more my daughter grows.
B000058983|5.0|Must have been confusing to be Arthur Lee in 1967.<br /><br />On the one hand, his band, Love, had ruled the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles for some time.  It was also a leading act on Elektra Records and had given it \\"Seven and Seven Is\\", a hit single the previous year.  The age was, or seemed, wide open, what with people expressing themselves artistically and politically in new ways, and Arthur Lee (like his friend Jimi Hendrix) was well on his way to beating white psychedelic rock at its own game.<br /><br />On the other hand, there was something in Lee's makeup that made him reluctant to tour behind his hit - the Doors, his label mates and main competitors on the Strip, were about to catch up to him and pass him right by.  Drugs and other forms of aggravation were ripping his band apart, so that he had to hire session musicians to provoke them into showing up for studio work, and those same indulgences were beginning to rip him apart, too.  Not to mention the dissolution of the civil rights and antiwar movements into violence and petty jealousies.  So Arthur Lee looked out over the city from his place in the Hollywood Hills and wrote \\"Sitting on the hillside / Watching all the people die\\".<br /><br />Everybody knows that suffering can sometimes produce great art, and \\"Forever Changes\\" is a good example of the type.  All through it, Lee strikes out at his demons, both internal and external - the line mentioned above in which he kills off the whole damn town is only the most extreme example.  Even his celebration of summer pleasures comes at one remove - it's called \\"The Good Humor Man He Sees Everything Like This\\".  The Good Humor man, mind you, not Arthur Lee.  Clearly, this writer saw things through a much darker filter - he even concluded that cut by editing his tape so that it sounds like the record has a skip in it.<br /><br />Most of the people he sings about here are phonies at best, himself included.  The Side One closer, \\"The Red Telephone\\", has him reflecting on his life and asking to be painted white as a result, a pretty outrageous thing for any black man to say at any time but especially in 1967, and the same song fades out with a voice that would have made Stepin Fetchit cringe, announcing that \\"All 'a God's chilluns gotta have dey freedom!\\"  So much for the brotherhood of man.<br /><br />A few things rescue the album from complete despair.  Lee's songwriting foil, Bryan MacLean, contributed a few relatively hopeful numbers to the set list, most especially \\"Old Man\\", a love song in which the singer's success with the object of his affections comes from following the advice of an experienced philosopher type.  Also a surprising sentiment to come out of the youth movement of the 60s, at which time no rocker had any business trusting anyone over 30.  In later years, MacLean voiced some complaints about this album and about Lee's behavior, particularly his mix of Maclean's \\"Along Again Or\\" - it buries the lead vocal so deep in the mix you can only hear Lee's harmony.  Nevertheless, however aggravated he was, his numbers add some critical balance to the experience of \\"Forever Changes\\".<br /><br />The music, too, offsets the bitterness of Lee's lyrics.  A lot of the cuts include really tasty string and brass charts, and even those without the orchestration tend to charge through some terrifically energetic rock beats, with twelve-string acoustic guitar strumming, spacious echoes, and a great big rhythm section.  Among other things, as has been pointed out before, the instrumentation on \\"Forever Changes\\" paints a pretty extensive musical picture of Los Angeles, from basic punk raunch all the way to mariachi filigree.  Genuine despair, I am told, strips away your energy.  This music does the opposite.<br /><br />Lee somehow managed to keep his sense of humor pretty much intact throughout his troubled explorations.  A lot of what I've already mentioned seems pretty bitter, all right, but Lee made at least some of these details so grotesque that you have to go through the bitterness and come out laughing.  The Kingfish dialect is spooky but hilarious, the bad editing can just as easily make you giggle as anything else, and although Lee covers murderous violence on a cut like \\"Live and Let Live,\\" he's got enough wit left to start it off with the observation that the snot he just wiped on his jeans has crystallized.  A little gross, to be sure, but remember, this was 1968.  A lot of other things were pretty gross back then, too.<br /><br />Finally, even considering the rage in Lee's lyrics and vocals, there's something very moving about listening to a man struggle with his crumbling world, refuse to roll over and play dead.  With all this madness all over the record, he finishes up by telling us \\"This is the time and this is the time and it is time!  Time!  Time!  TIME!\\"  And fades out.  Not exactly a sunshine-and-daffodils claim, but hopeful in its own way.  About the best you can expect after this journey through extremes of rage and disappointment, and a pretty good approach to the future under any circumstances.<br /><br />\\"Forever Changes\\" usually finds a place on any rock music Best Of list, and certainly deserves it, not only because it's a great piece of work, but because it demonstrates very clearly something that Pete Townshend of the Who once said.  Rock music, he claimed, helps you face your problems, and at the same time sort of dance all over them.  \\"Forever Changes\\" isn't exactly dance music, but it's more than good enough to listen to in hard times and a heck of a way for Love's classic lineup to say goodbye.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Cry out when in pain - you'll feel better.rness and come out laughing.

B000GPI2EK|5.0|In the arms race that is metal, bands are constantly trying to out \\"heavy\\" each other.  The result of this sonic brinksmanship is usually sloppy guitar work, played through over-cranked amps with some guy vomiting out lyrics on the mic.  A handful manage to rise to the top of the pack.  Slayer out thrashed everyone; Pantera took gut-punch brutality to new levels of artistry, and then there's Mastodon.<br />Unflinchingly unyielding in their intesity, yet they bring a level of musicianship and carefully honed artistry usually found in the realms of prog-rock.  This album assaults the ears with Slayeresk ferocity, but entices your brain like Dream Theater.  It's meaty, fast, furious, complex, and simply one of the best albums metal has seen in it's entire history.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Before seeing this series, I've always had my own best guesses about how these distinguished men and women who founded this country lived - basically  vague pictures in my head  originating from the last history book I had read in junior college.<br /><br />However I didn't *really* have any idea about how they interacted with each other, what types of disagreements or power struggles they had, who got along with whom, etc, even such as did the diplomatic couples show public affection.<br /><br />There were also the tough challenges that we don't experience in current times, of things like simple travel - taking a ship ride just to get to France or Britain was grueling and a hair-raising experience (in the series, there was an unexpected battle with a British warship for example, with both J.A and young J.Q.A. aboard).<br /><br />If you watch this with the main motive for trying to see violence and action: the battles, etc... this won't be for you (it's mostly drama and dialogue). However, what is more satisfying to me is how the series depicts the decisions that went into:  for or against war with France, etc.. and the various minor \\"incidences\\" such as when George Washington (played by David Morse ) told the French ambassador where he could put his 'tude.<br /><br />The various personal tragedies in the family back then were depicted in powerfully moving ways.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching drama based on real history, it's simply a must-see.
B001232NG8|2.0|I wish I could concur with the majority on this release and say the music had been enhanced, but I'm not hearing anything appropriate in these new mixes. After 40 years of enjoying my original mono & stereo pressings I was curious to hear what approach Bruce Botnick would take. In my opinion they decided to remove most of the subtle effects from the original mix in favor of \\"digital clarity\\" for a new generation.    While I agree that the original release of The Doors was dark, I found it enveloping in a way that the new mixes are not. The keyboards on Light My Fire sound thin and fast instead of full and rounded, and completely mismatch the softness of Jim Morrison's vocals.    Some classics are best left original, and this is one of them.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|Sure the acting is good but the plot is horrible.  Lets just go shoot up the whole city and live to tell about it without any rhyme or reason about how the bad guys escape.  The TV show was more intelligent.  IMO, this move is absolute dreck.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Katy Perry's One of the Boys is definitely one of the top CDs of 2008.     Why?  Because her lyrics are crisp, witty, & genuine, the music bright & foot-tapping memorable, and the studio production masterful. Taken together, this is a great example of a true artist who holds nothing back & brings a fresh energy to an increasingly self-absorbed & cliche music scene.    I myself enjoyed all of the songs. My favs of course are \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" with it's driving beat & haughty lyrics and \\"Ur So Gay\\" with it's clever quick fire lyrics sung with emotional exapseration ... & I love the horns & great production on this track. The production of the entire CD really brings out everything that Katy puts into the lyrics and music. Listen with your headphones to see what I mean.     It's an album which never runs out of energy or authenticity. \\"One of the Boys\\", \\"Thinking of You\\", \\"I'm Still Breathing\\" & \\"Mannequin\\" each has a story to tell both in words and music. Perry's energy & intuition flows through each song.    Not all may like her edgy delivery, but as a singer/songwriter, Katy nails it. Don't take her lyrics literally, they're more an exploration of emotions & ideas . . . though I do feel sorry for the guy with no penis.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I'm not a big radiohead fan, but this album is great all the way through. I don't skip any tracks- not even \\"House of Cards\\" which I had already heard a bunch of times before I bought the cd. Normally, you hear one of the songs from an album too many times before you get the whole disc, and you're sick of that one. But I still don't skip it. My only complaint is that I wish the album were longer, but that's just because I like everything so much.

B000000W8C|5.0|NORTHERN SOUL was one of those albums that I knew was supposed to be really good, but that I simply hadn't gotten around to listening to.  I was raiding a friend's CDs for new music to put onto my iPod and saw a copy of this.  I almost instantly fell in love with it.  I previously had primarily known the Verve from the wonderfully lush, beautiful single \\"Bitter Sweet Symphony.\\"  (My next online music purchase is probably going to be URBAN HYMNS, which my record store friends insist is better even than NORTHERN SOUL.)  I was delighted to learn that the many virtues of that single could be found on many of the songs on the album.<br /><br />I can't believe it took me so long to discover these guys.  Richard Ashcroft is an amazing talent, an absolutely brilliant songwriter, while Nick McCabe is the best recent British guitarist I know this side of Bernard Butler (I'll add that while I do definitely prefer Butler to McCabe as a guitarist, I much more strongly prefer Ashcroft to Brett Anderson as a vocalist).  But as great as Ashcroft and McCabe are, the arrangements are what put the songs way over the top in quality.  Cut after cut excels not merely because of the melody, lyrics, or performance, but because of the perfect use of strings or layering of guitars.  Each song is richly, lushly, wondrously layered to produce magical results.<br /><br />Though this is one of those rare albums that simply has few truly weak cuts, the four that start the album off are especially great.  I find the difference between albums created in the nineties and the new century to be fascinating compared to albums from the mid-eighties and earlier.  Then artists tried to start the album off with a great first cut, then saving the other best songs for the end of Side A and the beginning and end of Side B.  Now artists tend to frontload the albums.  Though they usually save some of their best cuts for later on the disc, they almost always put their 3 or 4 best songs right at the beginning.  These are followed by a couple of the weaker songs, before bringing back some of the best remaining material.  Thus here \\"New Decade,\\" \\"This is Music,\\" \\"On Your Own,\\" and \\"So It Goes\\" kicks off the album, but one of the album's few bad cuts, \\"Brainstorm Interlude,\\" follows.  It is pure filler that weakens the album as a whole.  But as soon as that clunker ends, we get the delightful \\"Drive You Home\\" (featuring one of Ashcroft's nicer vocals) and the best song on the second half of the album, \\"History.\\"<br /><br />All in all, this is a brilliant, beautiful album.

It is pure filler that weakens the album as a whole.  But as soon as that clunker ends, we get the delightful \\"Drive You Home\\" (featuring one of Ashcroft's nicer vocals) and the best song on the second half of the album, \\"History.\\"    All in all, this is a brilliant, beautiful album.

B001GM0GNC|5.0|It seems the reviews of The Police's new DVD/CD package are mixed at best.  I can't figure out what the naysayers are thinking on this one--I think \\"Certifiable\\" is perhaps the best live DVD I've ever seen.<br /><br />I did not attend a show on the big Police reunion tour last year, so I had no idea what the stage show looked like or what the set-list included, so the live DVD was my first look at Sting, Andy, and Stewart back together again.  The opening track, Message in a Bottle\\" was an excellent choice, and the lighting at that point was minimal.  Once \\"Synchronicity II\\" kicked in, the stage show kicked in, and so did the crowd.  They were on their feet the entire show and I was mesmerized by the musicianship of these 3 players.<br /><br />The first thing that surprised me was the sound quality.  I have a modest home theater system set up that I don't know much about other than how to turn it on and turn it up.  Without any tweaking at all, I noticed Sting's bass was much louder and more \\"present\\" than I would have expected.  It made for an interesting listen to the show, because it underscored what a great bassist Sting really is.  I'm sure most of us think of him as a singer/songwriter first and as a bassist a distant second.  He is a phenomenal player and underrated in that regard.<br /><br />But the Police is the combustion that happens between Sting and Stewart and Andy.  Just like Sting, Summers & Copeland prove themselves masters of their instruments.<br /><br />I have read some complaints that some of the songs were re-worked & sound a little different.  That's true, and from my own personal point of view, it's a great thing.  1st off, nothing is reworked so drastically that a fan wouldn't be able to recognize the song that's playing.  But if you've kept up with Sting's career lately, he does this regularly.  A little change here & there makes it a bit more interesting.  One reviewer called these changes \\"bored & lazy.\\"  If you watch dvd 2 in the set, you'll see how much work went into working up each song.  I, for one, loved the changes in the songs.<br /><br />If you're sitting here reading this thinking about purchasing the DVD/cd set, DON'T WAIT.  I buy a lot of live DVD sets like this, but this one is by far the best all around, from musicianship, to the stageshow, the song selection, and the extras that show how this band got back together.working up each song.

B001GZ6QEC|2.0|Can't have a viable triangle among two handsome men and a homely woman.  Doesn't work.  Nor does it make sense for the Joker to call Rachel Dawes \\"beautiful\\" when, in fact, Maggie Gyllenhaal is anything but!  These two disjoints nearly ruined the movie for me--why?  Because every time Maggie/Rachel came on the screen, my eyes said, \\"Ouch!\\" and my mind said, \\"not 'beautiful.'\\" I realize that such a reaction is limited and limiting; however, remember that this is movie and moviegoers consciously or sub-consciously expect traditional Hollywood esthetics.  As I said, you can not have two of the handsomest men in Hollywood vying for the love of one of the homeliest women in Hollywood without jarring the audience right out of the flow of the movie.  And I was jarred!     Heath Ledger was fine, not great, in my view.  The real talent in the film is Christian Bale--in any film he acts in, to be exact.  Bale, is without question, one of the world's finest.  Caine, Oldman, Eckhart, Ledger: all fine supporting actors, but Bale takes the prize.  Why hasn't Bale received Academy Award nominations for his work?  Another case of Hollywood showing their envy of English actors?  ][[ASIN:B001GZ6QC4 The Dark Knight (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)]]
B00007AJF8|5.0|What a gem of a movie. Imaginative writing that was so hilarious, I couldn't wait for the next scene, to see if it was going to be funnier that the previous one. Orson Bean (Doctor Lester) was an unbelievable filthy, dirty, sex-starved old coot - \\"Insane, old lech\\" is how John Cusak's character; Craig Schwartz put it. The interplay between Cusak and Kathryn Keener (Maxine) was \\"way out there.\\" Excellent direction from Spike Jonze.<br /><br />I don't know what else to add but that this was the weirdest, most enjoyable movie I've seen in years. We should all be so lucky as to be in John Malkovich's eyes and then spit out 15 minutes later.<br /><br />\\"I was John fu**ing Malkovich!\\" - exclaimed Cameron Diaz (Lotte Schwartz).

B00110K62U|3.0|I got the 10th Anniversary concert as a present for my dad, and although I have the same complaints as everyone else (pieces cut from the production), my main grievance is with the commercials at the beginning that you cannot skip over, no matter how hard you try.  These commercials for other productions last several minutes, and each time you want to watch the DVD, you must sit through them.  If you spend so much on a product, you should have the option of skipping the commercials.  This is the first DVD where I have had absolutely no ability to do so.

JW took his rather silly TV sf-western and turned up the seriousness more than a notch (think of a Roger Moore James Bond film improved up to a Daniel Craig James Bond film), and with the addition of movie-quality effects and better acting performances, this ends up being one of my favorite sf movies in recent years.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|I'll admit, I never was a big Metallica fan (as a guitar playin' Eddie Van Halen wannabe, the guitar riffs and solos sounded hopelessly amateurish and simplistic by comparison in the 80's, the heaviness and intensity notwithstanding), but after 20 years of hearing their brand of metal  on the radio etc, I'd picked out things here and there that I did like and it grows on you. For better or worse , they took metal to a rather bare bones and ruthless banal approach and heavy metal fans everywhere thought it de rigeur.   Nowadays, that straightforward fierceness and banality has been adopted by just about any heavy metal band to one degree or another. These tracks sound like a return to their earlier stuff, but with older and wiser lyrics and most strikingly , much more adept songwriting at least for the metal genre. The guitar riffs sound great and flow from section to section, and the whole of the songs sounds very musical, never too simplistic or repetitive, like their early days somtimes. Every tune just flat out sounds SATISFYING. All Nightmare Long was like an adrenaline shot. Unforgiven III was dramatic and melodic, and Hetfelds singing reminds me of Billy Joe Armstrong in spots! I'd spin this CD for anyone wanting to hear some quintessential Metallica. Good stuff.
0812975219|4.0|The author is a trader and writes about trading.  The book, however, is not at all a mere how-to book on investing but deals with much broader topics on life in general.  You may not learn anything new if you are familiar with probability and statistics; however, the author eloquently illuminates those \\"random\\" elements in society in various interesting perspectives, including history, science, philosophy, mathematics, psychology, and so on.  The author's illustrious reading habit made this a very intellectually stimulating book.    The author properly points out the survivor bias in those successful people in the market where randomness plays an especially huge role, as well as the stupidity of listening to inept journalists who cannot distinguish signals from noises.  However, I do not necessarily think that the book has a thorough enough introduction to the concept of randomness for the readers who are not very well versed in the concept of Monte Carlo techniques.  If you are such a reader, it would still be better to recall the author's statement that the luck rewards the prepared.  As far as trading is concerned, it seems that the author did make a profit even during the subprime crisis, but he does not really reveal anything in terms of useful investment strategy, though his approach can be guessed somewhat.    If you are science-type, there are not many enlightening moments; after all, nothing in the book really are new concepts.  However, it elucidates the importance of not being fooled by noise as well as the benefit of resigning, so to speak, as nobody can tame randomness in life.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|\\"Man on Wire\\" explores the execution and experience of one of the world's most famous artistic spectacles. Philippe Petit's wirewalk between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center on August 7, 1974. When he was 17 years old, Petit read an article about plans for the World Trade Center in New York that inspired the dream that would take 6 1/2 years to realize. James Marsh's film intertwines three threads as it builds toward its climax. It offers a blow-by-blow account of the dramatic feat that played out on August 6-7; it follows the construction of the Towers, seemingly built just for Philippe's ambitions; and it takes us through the years of preparation by Philippe and his accomplices.  There are recent interviews, archival footage of Philippe's team, and a moody black-and-white reenactment of the events that unfold as the participants recount their experiences.<br /><br />This is a competent documentary about an amazing feat of daring and artistry. It's serious in its intensity while embracing humor as well, and the preparation in France and New York is entertaining. But the film's ability to capture the passion and dedication that motivated Philippe Petit make it a great documentary, not just a good one. He's a man with a real lust for life, apparently completely free of neuroses, which he expresses through performance, particularly on the high wire. He might be the only wirewalker in the past 50 years who does not confine his art to the circus. I think the rest are afraid of going splat. Philippe Petit isn't, and, by the end of this film, we understand why. That's its great accomplishment. Philippe is 60 years old, still remarkably youthful and as passionate as he was at 25, so his interviews are terrific.<br /><br />Director James Marsh emphasizes the human drama through the perspective of Philippe's accomplices, while Philippe's own point of view is more one of concentration and glee. Four men ascended the Towers and rigged the wire after months of scouting the site: Philippe and Jean-Francois Heckel on the roof of the South Tower, Jean-Louis Blondeau and American Alan Welner on the North Tower. Jean-Louis was the only one of the team that planned the walk, apart from Philippe, who stuck with the project, the others having abandoned it for fear it would mean Philippe's death. And Jean-Louis said it was the worst wire he had ever rigged. These men are interviewed, along with those who participated in the preparation, including Philippe's then-girlfriend Annie Allix. In sum, this is an awe-inspiring account of an great feat of diligence and faith. In English and French with subtitles.<br /><br />The DVD (Magnolia 2008): \\"Sydney Harbour Bridge Crossing 1973\\" (20 min) is a short documentary by James Ricketson about Philippe Petit's preparation and execution of his wirewalk between the pylons of the Australian bridge, aided by Mark Lewis, who recounts his role in the feat. \\"Philippe Petit Interview\\" (13 min) is a long but interesting interview in which Petit talks about his passion for wirewalking, his approach to life, and what it all means to him. \\"The Man Who Walked Between the Towers\\" (10 min) is an animated film for children that recounts the story of the Twin Towers walk.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout DVD is awesome.  I bought this to shake up my exercise routine, and to get in more strength training during my week.  Jillian has three different leveled workouts on one DVD, which I find great--I alternate my regular cardio workouts with Jillian's workouts every other day, doing different levels of her workout on those alternate days.  She also does three minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs in each circuit, with 3 circuits total in each workout.  I have seen improved results in my strength levels, and am getting a little ripped to boot!  I have tried a LOT of other systems that combine cardio and strength (such as P90X), but this one gets the same work done in a MUCH shorter amount of time (each video is about 27 minutes long, compared to the hour and fifteen minutes P90X workouts usually lasted).  Since I get up early and work out before I go to work, these workouts let me sleep in a little more and get the same results. The moves are easy to follow, and there are no complicated moves to learn.  You just need a set of dumbbells and a mat.  I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants a great strength training workout in a short period of time.  You'll get results!
B00136NYR6|5.0|Love it or hate it, Highway 61 is Dylan's masterpiece, a real watershed moment in the evolution of the folk revival and the mid '60s rebirth of rock 'n' roll at the hands of Bob, the Beatles, etc.  Bob probably gained as many new fans as he lost old ones (think Newport '65), and this move produced likely as much controversy in the folk world as John Lennon's \\"Beatles are bigger than Jesus\\" comment did in the world in general--'66 would prove to be a difficult year for both of these rock icons--but once Highway 61 hit the racks in August of 1965, there was no going back.<br /><br />The album opens with Dylan's great riches-to-rags anthem, \\"Like a Rolling Stone,\\" a 6:07 single that went to #2 in the late summer of '65, prevented only from reaching the top spot by the Beatles' \\"Help!\\", which was #1 for three weeks.  \\"Stone\\" was also Dylan's final production with Tom Wilson behind the mixing desk; the remainder of the album was produced by Bob Johnston, with whom Dylan would work through Nashville Skyline.  Next up is \\"Tombstone Blues,\\" featuring some of Dylan's most amazing psychedelic poetry and some amazing guitar soloing from the late, great Michael Bloomfield, and then the track from which this review's title is drawn, the slow blues \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry.\\"  Then, the oddly upbeat car-death rocker \\"From a Buick 6\\" and Dylan's slow, vituperative \\"Ballad of a Thin Man,\\" a poison dart cast with deadly precision at Dylan's critics and detractors (\\"Something is happening here, but you don't know what it is...do you, Mr. Jones?\\").<br /><br />Side two opens, then, with \\"Queen Jane Approximately,\\" honestly my least favourite track on this album, probably because it seems excessively trebly and piercing (notably Dylan's harmonica solos between the last two verses); we then have the title cut, where Dylan's harmonica has been temporarily replaced with a police whistle, and the eponymous highway becomes a staging point for human sacrifice, homeless shelter, flea market (\\"I got 40 red white and blue shoestrings/And a thousand telephones that don't ring/Can you tell me where I might get rid of these things?\\"), Oedipal commingling (the Second Mother and the Seventh Son) and even the next World War.  \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is more of Dylan's acid-poetry, and the album closes with the epic \\"Desolation Row,\\" featuring a cast of thousands as only Dylan can write them (including Einstein Disguised as Robin Hood, Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot fighting in the Captain's tower, Romeo, Cinderella, the Phantom of the Opera and Cassanova).  Through it all, Dylan has the backing of Michael Bloomfield, Al Kooper (in his first-ever shot at playing the organ, for which Tom Wilson laughed at his hubris), the great Harvey Brooks (still known then as Harvey Goldstein), and Russ Savakus and Charlie McCoy (who would also play on Blonde on Blonde), among others.<br /><br />The casual fan might wish to stick with the compilations that include \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" among Dylan's other classics, but for the real devotee, or the collector, this is a necessary item.arket (\\"I got 40 red white and blue shoestrings/And a thousand telephones that don't ring/Can you tell me where I might get rid of these things?\\"), Oedipal commingling (the Second Mother and the Seventh Son) and even the next World War.  \\"Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues\\" is more of Dylan's acid-poetry, and the album closes with the epic \\"Desolation Row,\\" featuring a cast of thousands as only Dylan can write them (including Einstein Disguised as Robin Hood, Ezra Pound and T.S.

It can be very challenging finding *good* games that we can all play together...us without getting bored and our son without being overly challenged. Blokus fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />We have played together several times already, and each of us has won the game at least once. A nice bonus is that there are instructions not only for regular play, but for playing with one player, as well as team playing - it would be a terrific party game!<br /><br />The pieces and the board seem well made, the instructions are clear and easy to follow, and you can literally have the game set up and ready to play in about 3-4 minutes. I highly recommend this game for kids of all ages!
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I recommend buying this edition instead of the 10th anniversary edition.  There are a number of extras such as several commentaries by the director James Cammeron, cast and crew and noted historians.     James Cammeron did a wonderful job of breaking new ground, such as the ship breaking in half, which has never been seen before.  I feel that he cast the roles of officers Charles Lightoller and Harole Lowe perfectly.  The two actors Jonathan Phillips (Lightoller) and Ioan Griffudd (Lowe) were what I pictured them to be based on everything I read about them and pictures I saw of them.      The one negative part of this movie which I feel should be deleted was the suicide of 1st officer Murdock.  I have read a number a books on Titanic and there is no evidence or documentation that this happened.  It is an injustice to the family of William Murdock.    I felt that too much time was devoted to the Jack and Rose story.  Don't get me wrong, I thought the love story added entertainment to the movie, but I felt that more time should have been focused on the roles of Lightoller and Lowe and their roles in the tragic events.      The role of Molly Brown should have been bigger.  Few Titanic movies have ever portrayed her accurately.  She was a real heroine that night.  If anyone comes to Denver Colorado, be sure to take a tour through the Molly Brown House.  I make it a point to visit at least once a year since I live 7 blocks away.      The soundtrack was also great, especially the song \\"My heart Will Go On\\".  I feel that this song belongs to Lightoller and Lowe for their bravery.  Their hearts really did go on.
0316017922|3.0|It was a worthwhile read despite the fact that is it essentially a collage of stories with somewhat of a common thread. The section on pilot error really openend my eyes to what happens in the cockpit of commercial airplanes. He writes in a style that entertains and informs, however it is far from a fully researched and logically presented subject. In school terms it would the an incomplete or fail. Not a pass grade. However, for TV attention span America it will do the trick.     It is not a book in the sense that all of the chapters pertain to related topics. For instance the chapter on pilot error had nothing to do with outliers or success. (but it was very interesting)     Why do I think he has his thesis backwards? He posits that success depends more on the opportunity available to you than the effort you put into it. It is true that if you are not presented with opportunities it will be hard to succeed. However, I would like to point out that many people are exposed to the same opportunities and they will obtain not only a different degree of success but also complete failure. This is strictly due to how much effort and focus went into achieving success. That is the formula. Not the other way around as he states in this book.    Provided with the same opportunities one person will succeed and the other will fail.  The ingedients he calls responsible for success are mere contributing factors. The real reason for success is the effort put into the task.     Gladwell says no one succeeds by themselves. This is true. However, only YOU are responsible for your success. If YOU had chosen to sit on the couch all day YOU would fail. So while YOU could have the benefit of opportunities they are not responsible for your success. Only YOU yourself and the work YOU put in it make the real difference. He tried to turn this around in his book and I disagree with it.     I am afraid this book and its attitude could lead people to say that they were not given the opportunityand therefore they did not make it, versus them making what they could with their utmost best effort.

B0000041DF|2.0|I've watched Argerich play this piece, and have seen and listened to many, many other recordings of it. The various appraisals are, of course, sincere responses by the listeners who wished to post. My own background includes having a professional classical music family, including a pianist mom, and I grew up hearing (luckily) in person such pianists as Cliburn, Browning, and Graffman. Of course, music isn't a competition. Music is music. So I get a bit tired of comparing pieces and how they are played, as though we were comparing race horses. I do wish to say that although Ms. Argerich can play very, very fast, it has been a revelation to hear the 1941 Horowitz/Barbirolli live recording at Carnegie Hall, which I just received. Not only does he have the speed everyone seems to crave, he has the musicality and creativity that is absent in most other performances. It is, in a word, astonishing. Although sheer speed can be impressive in a physical sort of sense, it is the understanding of the music that really makes me want to listen. In truth, I like Horowitz's Reiner recording better...it is more about the music, but if one wants to watch race horses,then listen to the 1941 recording,and then we can put that to rest.

It must have been a hoot to work on that production, and that spills over to the audience!
1845924509|5.0|Professor Bainbridge brings his unusual, but welcome, experience to this mix of law and technology with a superb fifth edition of software law. There is a splendid glossary (which could do with a bit of expansion) and 12 chapters covering all the intellectual property law suspects (patents, confidentiality, competition etc) and some great stuff on Europe which would give UKIP a headache (deservedly) in the form of five appendices: three directives; a proposal; and some highly relevant web links.<br /><br />Bainbridge starts his book with his view that \\"at one time, the protection of computer software against unauthorised copying, distribution or use was not a significant one\\". He recognises that national and international IP laws have been ill-equipped to provide protection. This work clearly plugs a gap in the newly emerging area of 21st century software law. He states his central aim as examining critically the various forms of protection that can now be applied to computer software.<br /><br />His aim is achieved, and I hope many non-lawyers will read this work (it has few cases, readers will be relieved to find out!) as the bootleg DVD/CD menace continues and creative people can obtain better protection. It hits the IT spot nicely.
B00008DDSC|5.0|If you enjoy love storys with a bit of a twist then this movie is for you.
B000ZLFALS|2.0|I'm giving this movie a 2-star rating due to the fact that the description is misleading. The movie is listed as having SDH. SDH is an acronym for \\"Subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing\\". In addition to captioning spoken dialogue, SDH provides non-dialogue audio commentary and speaker identification for off-screen voices. All of this is very important for a person with a hearing disability to understand and enjoy a movie. This movie is labeled as having SDH in the language menu but does not caption any of the song lyrics. This is unacceptable for a musical. I've provided a copy of the email my fiance sent to Sony (below) regarding this issue. Those wishing with hearing disabilities, please take notice. We really loved the movie after seeing it on TV but unfortunately we have to send this copy back. To Sony's credit, they did respond to our complaint with (tedious) instructions on how to receive a refund. We hate to have to send this movie back but unfortunately we have no other choice. =(<br /><br />Subject: Complaint about subtitles for deaf and hard-of-hearing in Across the Universe<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />I recently bought the Across the Universe Blu-ray Disc.  I had seen the<br />movie on a movie channel on TV and loved it.  I am hearing-impaired and,<br />while I can hear the tune to a song, I cannot understand the words.  When I<br />watched the movie on TV, the spoken and sung lyrics were captioned.  None<br />were left out.  On the Blu-ray, there's a setting for SDH, which means that<br />the movie is captioned explicitly for those who can't hear well and need the<br />captions to understand the words and be alerted to sounds in the movie.<br />However, the songs were NOT subtitled.  Instead, I got \\"[SINGING]\\" whenever<br />they would sing.  Um, it's a MUSICAL.  Half the movie is sung--how am I (or<br />any other hearing-impaired or deaf customer) supposed to understand the<br />movie if I can only read HALF of the words?  The words in the songs were<br />important to understanding the story.<br /><br />I've heard before that Sony does not caption songs because they're afraid of<br />being sued for copy infringement.  I do not understand this because you<br />are performing a captioning service.  The movies on TV are captioned,<br />including lyrics almost all the time.  The TV station wouldn't be sued<br />because they're a performing captioning service for the disabled.  You do<br />understand that you are misleading your customers when you label a<br />*musical*as subtitled for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, yet you don't<br />subtitle the songs (half of the words in the movie)?<br /><br />I would like to file an official complaint with Sony.  The SDH label is<br />misleading.  I would like a refund.  I cannot return the Blu-ray to the<br />store because it has been opened.  However, I cannot fully enjoy the movie<br />because it does not allow someone with a hearing disability to understand<br />the story, yet the product is labeled as providing captions for the deaf and<br />hard-of-hearing.  Something must be done about the labels on this Blu-ray.<br />The SDH label should be removed immediately.<br /><br />I would appreciate a prompt reply.<br /><br />Thank youhat Sony does not caption songs because they're afraid of  being sued for copy infringement.

B001I45UFC|1.0|I love the idea of other worlds and magic and adventure, and I love the idea of Narnia. However, I am not a big fan of the way C.S. Lewis wrote the book. Everything sounded too...  plain and straightforward, I guess you could say. Personally, I prefer books with more interesting, colorful language. But the actual world of Narnia is amazing. By the way, I couldn't figure out how to change the star rating but I give this book three stars.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|If you are a 12-year-old know-it-all, an addle-brained leftist or just simple, you'll probably think this movie is all that and a bag of chips.    If you have ever given the weighty issues of the day a moment's true consideration, however, you'll find yourself quickly losing patience with this screed. This is a worthless bit of tripe. It is anti-human and anti-civilization. It is truly abhorrent.    That it was well received indicates nothing more than the shocking degree that self-loathing has overtaken the human experience.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|Is not who wants to be a millionaire in this case, but why Jamal Malik (Dev Patel), wants to be a millionaire--and how he's getting the answers to questions on the Indian variant of the gameshow that have stumped far better men than he. Was he cheating? Did he have an accomplice?  Was it just dumb luck?      Or was it written?    As a matter of fact, the police have hauled him in to answer that question.  Sergeant Srinivas (Saurabh Shukla) uses some very rough questioning techniques to find out the truth.  Out of this, comes an incredible lifestory of a young man who's persisted to this point despite pretty amazing odds against him.  Frankly, the odds against his survival in the streets are about as good as him winning the 20 million that is the ultimate prize of the show.     As the questioning continues, Jamal reveals bits of his life that have helped him come to this point and the answers to the questions asked.      \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is not an easy watch.  Some scenes will haunt you for a good long time and may well change your perspective on your own life.  It's also a beautiful and fascinating film.  I wouldn't miss a moment of it and if you have the courage to see some rough scenes, I strongly recommend it.      One of the best films of 2008?  One of the best of the past 10 or so years, actually.      Rebecca Kyle, December 2008
0446579939|2.0|I really love nicholas sparks book. Some of his books have made me cry and I usually don't do that. This book is not one of those books that I cried at!

B001GKJ2FW|1.0|Alrighty... there are probably very few musicals that I ever liked... and I did like Grease. The sequal to Grease I thought was a flop and THIS movie \\"Momma Mia\\" does even worse. I'm sorry... this is the worst review I have ever given any movie... normally I like most movies and can appreciate them for what they are... heck, I even liked \\"Battlefield Earth\\" with John Travolta even though the reviews said it sucked.  Anyways... the likes of Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan and of course ABBA are the only saving qualities to this movie. It's unfortunate that such a goofy movie needs to be associated with ABBA. I was starting to think that the movie was a tribute to ABBA since they tried to squeeze in as many songs as possible. More song than dialog and character building. Every one was so in love with the character played by Meryl Streep even tho she probably slept around with a million guys and no one knew who the father of the \\"daughter getting married\\" was. She probably ran out of room in her diary to mention so many guys. Sorry... the premise of this movie is silly, and glorifying it all makes it worse. My last thoughts for the movie was everyone was pumped up on estrogen and this movie is responsible for the girlification of America... haha. Ok, seriously... that crossed my mind. I became quite critical of the movie while watching it... I didn't really enjoy it so much... but I did watch it end to end.
B000F3T3CS|4.0|This dvd was my first experience of the entire opera and I must say the music is serviceable if forgettable and naturally requires some awesome singers. Everyone in the cast is fully into their roles and you can't fault the acting, the tenor as others have noted, completely inhabiting his character and delivering a comic performance of outstanding quality. The main problem with the music is that there are a lot of notes hiding the lack of a good tune until our hero sings Una furtiva lagrima in the second act notable for it's lack of decorative notes and the beauty and simplicity of it's melody. He is rewarded with such a long ovation that he finally breaks character and the conductor decides \\"Well, let's do it again fella.\\" He sings the aria again to another stunning ovation and tears come to his eyes. Anna gets quite a nice ovation after she sings her dazzling aria declaring her love. Kudos to the supporting players Dr. Dulcamara and Seargant Belcore. An enjoyable romp.

B001LRJH0K|4.0|The story of Appaloosa is very similar to that of the excellent [[ASIN:B0007PALQG Warlock]]. Two mercenary \\"lawmen\\" are summoned to a town being terrorized by a local band of cowboys (led by a powerful and particularly ruthless rancher -- in Appaloosa's case, Randall Bragg played by Jeremy Irons). These lawmen are close friends and have worked together for many years, moving from town to town killing bad guys for money. They are called upon when the town's previous sheriff is murdered. They agree to clean up the town, but only if the town agrees to grant them any power they wish to do so.<br /><br />Here the stories of Warlock and Appaloosa diverge. Warlock makes great use of the idea that fighting outlaws with mercenaries is a morally questionable solution, while Appaloosa features only one scene that ponders the question, even though the setup seems tailor-made for further conflict. Harris' character, Virgil, has been made uncomfortable and embarrassed by a conversation with his romantic interest (played by Renee Zellwegger), so he takes it out on some workers having a drink at the bar. Though drunk, they are doing no harm, and Harris' explosive temper and sense of impunity are first exhibited as he viciously pummels one of them before being restrained by Viggo's character (Everett). One of the town's officials questions this behavior, but beyond that it is never addressed again.<br /><br />Other story similarities include a confrontation at the jailhouse (though the specifics of the scene were more reminiscent of one in [[ASIN:B000P6XU5G Rio Bravo]]), a love interest that may lead to the retirement of one of the characters and the dissolution of their partnership, a final shoot-out that ends the partnership and that the title of each movie is simply the name of the town in which the action takes place.<br /><br />Beyond those the story plays out in a very different fashion. There is no character equivalent in Appaloosa to Richard Widmark's outlaw-turned-lawman, Everett doesn't have any of the shadiness that Anthony Quinn's \\"Doc Holiday\\" had, and there is no betrayal among the old friends. The romantic interest also plays out very differently in Appaloosa.<br /><br />Overall, the story is good, but there did seem to be a few too many Acts. I didn't mind that much, because I enjoyed all the possibly extraneous scenes, but it did feel a little long, a little less tight, even though the movie ran just under two hours. And there was one bone-headed decision that you see coming from a mile away. If you're a smart guy who has been cleaning out towns of bad guys for years now, what's the dumbest thing you can do? Very publicly fall in love with a girl who now lives in the town. I said out loud \\"liability and leverage\\" as soon as I saw Virgil go after her.<br /><br />Other good points: Harris demonstrates a talent for writing (and delivering) comfortable, funny, and natural sounding dialogue. (A friend of mine said the dialogue at the beginning was bad, but I don't remember.) The relationship between Everett and Virgil is great. They effectively demonstrate respect, loyalty and love in subtle believable ways. Renee Zellwegger's character surprises you several times and turns out to be as interesting as the two leads. Irons' character doesn't have much substance to him other than \\"I'm a jerk,\\" but he does have some good moments of interaction with the Virgil and Everett.<br /><br />Harris, along with his DP, has a good eye for the scenery. Everything is shot on location, and it looks great. He also shoots within these locales well; I always knew where the characters were in relation to one another (which sounds simplistic, but I'm thinking of the scene on the river with the Indians where Everett rides up to meet them). I appreciated the unique camera work in the scene on the train where Allison is brought out from underneath the bridge.<br /><br />Of course, I have to comment on the action and perpetrators there-of. This isn't [[ASIN:B000XRO3MQ 3:10 to Yuma (2007)]] or [[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone]], so the gunplay is pretty sparse. But when it happens, it's well-staged, and often unique in consequence. Virgil and Everett rescuing the kidnappers from the Indians, for example, plays out differently than you might expect. Allison has been kidnapped in order to secure Bragg's release, and Virgil and Everett have tracked them to a canyon. Before they can act, they notice a party of Indians about to raid them. They allow this until the Indians start to take Allison. Rather than shooting the Indians, Virgil and Everett shoot the pack-horse that Allison is on, and fire up into the air to scatter the raiding party. Later, Everett offers the group Bragg's horse to make up for the one they shot. Another unique scene is the shoot-out in the Mexican town. It's close-quarters and over in seconds. It also leads to one of the funniest lines in the movie.<br /><br />Virgil and Everett lie on the ground, wounded but alive.<br /><br />Everett: That was quick.<br />Virgil: Yeah, everybody could shoot.<br /><br />The sound design is excellent, right up there with [[ASIN:B0000TANUI Open Range]] in terms of power and realism.<br /><br />And the guns! Well, The Gun, anyway.<br /><br />As you may have read, Everett carries a very unique item: an 8-gauge double-barreled shotgun. Until Appaloosa, I didn't even know 8 was a possible gauge. I'd heard of 10-gauges, and only seen one or two at all the gun auctions I've been to. For those unfamiliar with the gauge system, the smaller the number, the larger the bore. 12-gauge is the most popular. My double-barrel is 12. So the 8-gauge that Everett wields is HUGE, and is mentioned specifically about five times in the beginning of the movie. There are only one or two scenes where Everett is without it, too. He lugs that honkin' thing around everywhere he goes. And you only get to see him use it twice! The other guns are all pretty standard, though I noticed Everett's sidearm is a Colt open-top conversion, which is also unique.<br /><br />I recommend Appaloosa to Western fans and fans of Viggo & Ed.<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of this film sports a nice transfer, great sound, and a few decent supplements.ombstone]], so the gunplay is pretty sparse.

B0007TKNCY|5.0|The item was just as described and it was shipped out almost immediately.  I think I received it four or five days after I purchased it.
0380730405|5.0|For all of Rebecca's hype as the \\"modern masterpiece\\" of Gothic fiction, romantic suspense, etc., I think readers need to understand exactly what they will be getting with this story. I can understand people's frustration with the Second Mrs. De Winter (I wanted to slap her repeatedly too) and what they perceive as a \\"boring narrative pace\\" where nothing \\"happens until the last hundred pages or so,\\" and while these are all valid points to a degree, I think they should approach the novel from a different perspective.<br /><br />Rebecca is first and foremost a probe into human psychology. Du Maurier herself saw this as a \\"study of jealousy.\\" There is romance, but the story is not romantic, nor was it intended to be. The narrator and Maxim have a love of co-dependency on her part and selfishness on his part. A forty-two year old man and twenty-one year old girl meet in Monte Carlo and marry within several weeks. The man takes his inexperienced bride back to his great estate and thrusts her into a life she's not prepared for. The Second Mrs. De Winter becomes insecure and obsessive over her husband's dead first wife, the seemingly beautiful, intelligent, and perfect Rebecca.<br /><br />People claim that the Second Mrs. De Winter is spineless, weak, over-imaginative, and spends her time making the situation worse than it is, imagining that she is more deficient that she is, and they are right! But the narrator is not supposed to be anything other than that.  The Second Mrs. De Winter is pathetic, and she could have solved a lot of her problems by simply firing Mrs. Danvers and/or taking initiative, but she allows her own internal fears to stop her from doing anything. She keeps trying to convince herself that she and Maxim \\"are happy,\\" even though the shadow of the past looms over them. When Maxim goes away to London for a few days, the narrator actually feels more free and happier than she's been in a while then tells herself she's being \\"wicked,\\" \\"unloyal,\\" that Maximis her \\"world.\\" The relationship has a dark undertone to it from the beginning. Even when Maxim proposes to her, she tells herself that she didn't really want a \\"church wedding\\" and all that, except she does.<br /><br />Mrs. Danvers, the creepy housekeeper, obsesses over Rebecca too and resents the Second Mrs. De Winter for both replacing her mistress AND for being a coward (if our narrator had been bold the first time they met it might have made for an entirely different dynamic between the two, maybe Danvers might even have respected her a little). Mrs. Danvers loved Rebecca for being strong, and the psychological warfare she wages upon the narrator, as well as the shrine she keeps for Rebecca makes for interesting material.<br /><br />Maxim is our third character study. His and Rebecca's relationship and the drama that followed could have been prevented if Maxim hadn't allowed his pride and excessive love of \\"Manderly\\" to...well, I leave that for the reader to discover. About halfway through the book, he asks if his wife is he was \\"selfish\\" for marrying her, showing that he's aware of what he's done yet there's not much he can do about it now. Maxim broods, is aloof and on the cold-blooded side, and how much he loves the narrator for herself versus her being the anti-Rebecca (and thus helping him to \\"blot out the past\\") is a subject of discussion.<br /><br />I've seen a few people who called the ending \\"happily ever after.\\" They need to re-read the end and the beginning of the novel (which I grant--the first two chapters are a chore to get through). The narrator and Maxim survive through their ordeal, escape, and are \\"free\\" from the past with no \\"secrets between us now,\\" but they live in exile, scarred forever by what has happened. They do not go off into the sunset. In fact, one must go back to narrator's obnoxious employer, Mrs. Van Hopper, who upon hearing of her engagement to Maxim, says \\"you are making a big mistake--one you will bitterly regret.\\" One can'thelp but wonder if the Mrs. Van Hopper wasn't right, not that the narrator would ever allow herself to *think* so.<br /><br />The character of Rebecca herself is fascinating. Dead before the story begins, we only know her through what other people say. And as the Second Mrs. De Winter's demonstrates through her own narrative, perception can be quite different from reality.<br /><br />If you're looking for an epic, love conquers all romance or an exciting, thrilling plot in the modern sense, Rebecca might not be for you. But if you allow yourlself to understand the subtlties of the Second Mrs. De Winter's highly subjective narrative--what she believes or imagines versus what is true--and if you are willing to journey into the complexity of human nature and relationships, Rebecca is well worth your time and energy. And once you past the first few chapters, it's quite an easy read.<br /><br />This is a novel of character.
B000P12LWY|3.0|season 1 was plagued with horribly dialog, simplistic plotting and storylines, weak acting, and a lack of complexity that was overwhelming at times.      While interesting concepts were introduced from time to time these were quickly forgotten and the show relayed on what premium networks have focused on for years juvenile excuses for characters to have sex with one another.  Rome had this as well but at least it managed to have an interesting story line to go along with it.            The lone bright spot of that season was Sam Neil, who quite frankly acted circles around everyone else.      That being said I have heard that Season 2 is somewhat of an improvement.  I personally don't have the stomach for it but anyone even mildly interested in the show I would advise to start there because you are barking up the wrong tree with the first season.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Okay, I was younger when ABBA was singing and dancing their way into our hearts with their great songs. Now that I'm older, well the songs are still in my heart. I work out--at home of course--to the beat of ABBA. It is simply impossible to find music this good, IMO. They say imitation is the best form of flattery, and the music in this movie is good, not great. The acting is another matter: it is great. Meryl has never been better. Can you imagine 007 in a musical? Hilarious. Yes, it is, IMO, more of a romantic comedy than strictly a musical. The story line was fantastically entertaining. Combine that with the nostalga of ABBA music, throw in some premium actors, and you have a hit.     I admit that it seemed silly at times, and I had to laugh at Pierce Brosnan's singing (but what a great, courageous attempt). I don't often look at the director's remarks, but these remarks were highly interesting as to the filming and recording. Did I mention the karoke sing-along complete with words to the songs? Yep, gotta love it.     Last, I admit I was moved to tears with the combo of music, acting, and story line. The young Sophia (Amanda) reminded me of my first love, full of life and zesto. Her singing skills were simply outstanding.     If you haven't guessed I highly recommend you see this feature. Give yourself a sentimental opportunity and you may find this is one of the best you will ever experience.

Slim cases so shelf space is minimized!  EXCELLENT!!    About a rush to market, snatching up media related to STAR WARS as soon as it hits the shelf.  If you don't like the movies themselves or the packaging or the recording quality that is one thing. Whining about your own gullibility is quite another.  Let me clue you in.  If Lucas makes or includes special features, enhancements and the like ...  he will not fail to promote that. Investigate the product before you buy.  And to those of you who didn't even buy any products but are just looking for places to gripe, this is not the appropriate place.    This is the excellent product that I anticipated to the point of not buying any of the movies when they first released to video.  It is as much as it promises to be.  (I expect the same to be true of the other volume containing ep. 4-6.)  If you like space saving box set bundles without a lot of extra bells and whistles, this is for you.    These sci-fi movie fantasy adventures, though a bit juvenile in their scripts and exhibitions, have become family classic adventure movies that inspire the imagination and adequately entertain a growing audience. A series of perennial favorites well on there way to becoming \\"timeless\\" classics.
B001AII4RM|3.0|A $150 million budget. A realistic Healthow voiced by Robin Wright Penn. An even more realistic Hrothgar voiced by Anthony Hopkins ([[ASIN:B000MEYJI8 Bobby]]). John Malkovich ([[ASIN:B001JIE7JM Burn After Reading]]) as Unferth. Ray Winstone ([[ASIN:B000M5AJQI The Departed]]) as the dominating Beowulf. And the sexiest woman alive, Angelina Jolie ([[ASIN:B001GKJ2FC Wanted]]) as Grendel's deceptive mother. I mean, what a cast! This is what great films are made of. And the realism of the computer animation in terms of how they resembled the actual actors was astonishing ...which begged a pretty big question: WHY NOT SIMPLY FILM BEOWULF WITH LIVE ACTION AND NOT ANIMATION?!<br /><br />Cost was probably an issue, but with the $150 million budget I think they could've done a fine live action film. In 2005 Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarson proved it could be done with his very nicely done [[ASIN:B000UYX4OK Beowulf & Grendel]] starring Gerard Butler ([[ASIN:B000Q6GX5Y 300]]). With comparable run times (103 minutes to 114 minutes) and Beowulf & Grendel's much lower budget (I believe it was around $75 million), it can be done and done well if you have the inclination. But, for whatever reason, director Robert Zemeckis ([[ASIN:B000IFRT38 Monster House]]) decided to shoot it this way.<br /><br />It may sound as if I'm bashing animated films in general, which I'm not. There are some really great ones out there ([[ASIN:B0015HS5S6 Finding Nemo]], [[ASIN:B000EQ5UHS Hoodwinked]], etc.), so animation can be pulled off if care is taken to present it as such. But with Beowulf, it seems they were trying to mix live action with animation in order to produce some sort of hybrid ...which simply didn't work for me. It might for some and that's fine, but, if you're going to show realistic characters that look like the actual actors, why not simply do live action? It's so maddening!<br /><br />It was nice, however, to see some care taken with the source material (namely Neil Gaiman's reimagining of the epic poem by the same name). Beowulf had some shady dealings and it was refreshing to see this brought out in the story and not simply showing him as some flawless hero.<br /><br />Still, if you're into animation, this one might not work for you. Or if you're solely a live action fan, this one might REALLY bug you. So beware. You've been warned.the same name).

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|For a catastrophic event movie, it is unique in that it restricts the perspective of events to the limited knowledge, perspective and insight of a (seemingly) randomly selected point of view.  The sense of photo-realism is unique with the filming style (personal video unit perspective) but the behavior acting is not very realistic.  The acting is subordinate to the suspense plot. Special effects inject a setting of compelling surrealism.    The compelling question in the acting drama is whether in extreme psychological situations the mind would choose irrational paths.  For example, since the video perspective is supposed to be an amateur eyewitness video log, what would compel a person to forgo natural and instinctive tendencies to self preservation and film events of such horrific personal and familiar devastation.  On the surface, it seems ridiculous.  Perhaps an exercise to rationalize it is overreaching.    The characters are steered through a world destined to showcase their personal faults while snaring them in a constant life and death struggle.  It is, however, difficult to read any larger point or purpose into the unfolding of the drama than the rescue plot points.    The gaps in story are provoking to the imagination.  Information is withheld the viewer as to causes and reasons.  If a person cares enough, it's a puzzle.  If they don't, it's a joke.    The devastation theme is almost textbook catastrophe horror.  The plot is action based and as an action movie it is \\"dizzily\\" intense.  In such stories there is not as much need or cause for dramatic showcasing.  Truly an action adventure.  What else would you expect?
B0013FSL3E|4.0|WALL-E sets new standards for computer-generated animation. This movie is just fantastic in that regard; I often had to remind myself that nothing you see on-screen is real in a physical sense. That said, I can't quite give WALL-E five stars because most of the time it's all style with little or no substance. The second half contains some entertaining riffs on \\"2001,\\" but for long stretches there's just a lot of frenetic action for action's sake. I enjoyed this movie, and would recommend it to just about anyone, but I wish there had been more substance to match the spectacular production values!
B00000IQMT|5.0|This was my favorite star wars movie, so i had to get the sound track. the song i like the best: Duel of the fates. darth maul has the coolest fight music, next to Final Fantasy 7's Sephiroth's One-Winged Angel. i used this sound track in a lot of my music videoes. i recommend it, if for no other reason, it StarWars.
B0013ND30M|1.0|This was a gift for our granddaughter and the DVD is defective. We will soon be going through the return process.
B000003Z4C|5.0|I find it difficult to pick a favorite of Nick Cave's work, but this is close.  I have followed him (not physically!  Okay, only once) since The Birthday Party.  I worked for a subsidiary of his label when \\"The Good Son\\" was released, and a lot of Birthday Party fans didn't care for it, even though the ingrates got an advance release copy.  But Nick Cave has continued to move on with each CD, and if fans of \\"Junkyard\\" aren't satisfied, I would have to say they are only hurting themselves.  Mr. Cave's songwriting ability is nothing short of genius; he's in my Top 5 list of underappreciated songwriters, along with Andy Prieboy.  \\"I Let Love In\\" not only showcases his abilities, it does so in a way that keeps the listener going and guessing from song to song.  Of course the opening track grabs right away, but segues into \\"Nobody's Baby Now\\" in a way that I thought was a little shaky at first, but appreciate now.  This CD was so good, so much the work of a truly gifted artist, that when his publicist wanted to me to do an interview (yes, label to journalist, it could have ruined me but I quit) I turned the chance down.  That is how good he is- he scares me.  Another reviwer had a negative reaction to \\"Janglin' Jack\\" and it wasn't my favorite, either, but I grew to appreciate it.  There's a reason it's called \\"Janglin\\"- the music and the lyrics are meant to convey \\"Janglin\\".  I don't normally try to pick favorites with Nick Cave songs, but I must say, \\"Loverman\\" is brilliant and haunting.  Or brilliantly haunting, whatever.  If you like Nick Cave and don't own it, buy it.  If you appreciate talented songwriting, buy it.  And if you're an old Birthday Party fan...give it a shot.
015206396X|5.0|Summary: Graceling is about a teenage girl named Katsa. She lives in a world, where people are born with amazing gift. They can climb trees, have super strength, automatic knowledge of weather, and many other graces. Graces are born with two very different eye colors. Katsa is one them. She killed a cousin when she was 8, causing her to become a henchwomen for her uncle, King Randa of Middlun. She also runs The Council with the help of her friends, that tries to put justice and fairness into the 7 nations. She meets a stranger, named Po, who is also graced. He is the first one to challenge her and they embark on an amazing journey.<br /><br />My Review: I though it was a very well written. I like the characters, they were very in depth. I think it was an excellent first novel. The ending did surprise me, but it was still pretty amazing. I am looking forward to the prequel, Fire and Book 3.
B001EOQWFI|5.0|Wall-e is a movie that any age can enjoy. It is entertaining and catchy for younger audiences, has very little dialogue in most of the movie, so it's easy to follow even if english isn't your first language. Beyond the eye popping visuals, quirky score and cute catch-phases (I dare you not to imitate WALL-E at least once after watching this show!), it also has a depth to the movie the older audiences will enjoy and appreciate.     As for the product itsself, the digital copy that comes with it is very convenient if you have a psp or I-pod video. The only bad thing is that you get a limited amount of uses (for obvious anti-pirating reasons) to download onto a pc, which, if you format your harddrive or have a computer problem, can be a bother. The special features are great, including a short about one of the minor characters in the movie, and the animated short that was shown in the movie theatre before the actual feature presentation. (Like the little prehistoric squirrel stories before Ice Age.)
B00000IQCA|5.0|Nashville and this movie (Pret a Porter, in itself something of a pun) are my two favorite Altman movies.  Both feature a large cast of characters, no plot worth mentioning, curious \\"now you see me, now you don't\\" characters (here the amazing character played by Marcello Mastroianni), dazzling costumes (a bit higher-class in this movie than in the home of the Grand Ole Opry, obviously ;-), constant cuts back and forth between various (mostly unconnected) threads, all at an easy pace and with tongue firmly in cheek.  It is visually alluring while poking gentle fun at everything that comes within its scope, from the omnipresent dog poop on Parisian sidewalks to grand hotels, journalists, editors, purchasers, and, of course, fashion designers. Sophia Loren shows that one of the most beautiful women in the world can remain gorgeous long past the time most of us have stopped looking in the mirror; Julia Roberts, arriving in a wine stained \\"greatest mom\\" T-shirt, gives a superb performance as a classy alcoholic; Marcello Mastroianni looks suitably sinister, worried, sweet, and down-home in turn, lurking around every corner and wielding a mean handheld sewing machine ;-), and Kim Basinger is the TV anchor we all love to hate, but with a difference... Many other stars put in appearances, including a number of models and designers starring as themselves.  No, it's not really deep -- but who thought that Nashville was deep and why should every movie be deep?  It is a whirlwind of impressions, colors, fashions, and people, all lovingly mixed for your entertainment.  Pure Altman and a great movie!
B001GMH8TM|5.0|Pay attention to camera placement in this film.  It's genius and further evidence that, along with Ridley Scott, Peter Weir remains the best working director never to win an Oscar.  Had the Academy not waited until Return of the King to Award Peter Jackson, Weir likely would have won for Master & Commander -a masterful piece of film-making.
