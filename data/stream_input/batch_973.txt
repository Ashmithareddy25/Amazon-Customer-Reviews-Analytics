B002T3GGVI|3.0|How Does A Small Nation Become An Economic Whiz-Bang Like Israel?      Kinda helps when the US taxpayer subsides $8 billion in direct annual payments, several billion in annual loan guarantees (which don't get paid back and isn't readily published), and deals that allow technology transfers on an unprecedented scale for a foreign power.    Now provide this economic help to a nation of only 5 million people.   You get the picture.    Israel is a great country, wonderful people and I hope they prosper even more than they currently are doing and finally get some peace, but I do get a bit annoyed with a ra-ra book like this not mentioning the role of the US taxpayer in making Israel a success story.    The author needs to award the USA more credit, and I didn't really like the slams against other nations -- unnecessary in my opinion.

B00000IMTE|4.0|Basically proclaiming Deep Purple a lost cause and bereft of further importance, Ritchie Blackmore teamed up with American band Elf to form the first of the MANY lineups of Rainbow in early 1975. Blackmore had struck up a relationship with Elf's singer, a man christened Ronald Padavona but who sang professionally as Ronnie James Dio and thus a legend was born. Rainbow's debut, though it was meant to be a break from the funk metal that Purple was now trotting out and the honky-tonk styling's of Elf was in practice sort of a combination of both. However the future of the band was encapsulated in at least two of the record's most important cuts. \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" is quite simply one of the greatest rock songs ever and could very well be my favorite song of all time. The medieval, mystical lyrics combined with the Machine Head era heavy riffing to create a masterpiece. \\"Sixteenth Century Greensleeves\\" became another goth anthem from the debut with its castle and dungeons imagery. \\"Catch the Rainbow\\", \\"Self Portrait\\" and perhaps \\"Temple of the King\\" also moved in direct of the next Rainbow project which would leave no doubt behind that Rainbow was a serious metal band, especially during the genre's toddler stages.  I have always had a lot of affection for this record but there are moments that make me cringe, but none from the above mentioned songs. Blackmore would soon jettison the entire band sans Dio and start again....and the results would be truly magical.

B001SN78JO|4.0|Jim Carey got very depressed and anti social after his ex-wife divorced him. He lived his depressing life every day until one of his friends talked him into attending an inspirational seminar called Yes Man. In this seminar, Jim made a pact with himself that he would say yes to everything in his life, no matter how weird or dangerous the situation is. He started doing that, and his life changed very positively and got very interesting.     The morale behind this film is that we should conquer our inner fears and say yes to things we really want to do deep inside but are afraid of. If you want to ask someone to marry you but you're afraid of rejection, go for it, at least you will know how she feels about you. If you never ask her, youl will stay all your life wondering what she would have answered.     The humor in the movie is good. Its not Dumb and Dumber type of comedy that will throw you off your seat, but its descent.
0743497465|5.0|Dan Brown is the reason I read. I have never been a much of a reader, as a matter of fact Deception Point was the first book I read outside of school on my own free time. I picked it up by chance one day and started to read, I was immediately hooked. Not only did the storyline fascinate me, but the characters made me fall in love with this book. Each character, well important characters, had their own background story and events in their past that made them unique yet still relatable to people I personally know. Yes, the book was a little wordy at times and seems to drag on, but it still kept me interested. I have read several reviews of this book and it seems to be a love hate book, few are in between, but with a government conspiracy, plot twists, action, and some romance on the side, what's not to love?
B000VECAEO|5.0|This is by far the best season of Seinfeld, although I'm a fanatic and love every season.  I'm not going to list all the episodes since the're are no bad ones, however, the extras at the beginning of every episode are priceless.
B00127RAJY|4.0|So, I get to say \\"Jillian kicked my butt\\" like everyone else, but 30 days of the same routine is boring.  I wouldn't do it on the treadmill, I don't like doing it at home.  You put yourself on autopilot by the 3rd time you've done the routine.  You are dripping buckets of sweat, but you have memorized the \\"motivational sayings\\" and the order of the routine.  You would with any DVD.  I know, I have some I've done for over 5 years!  I think the fact that these are less than 30 minutes really hits it home that they are boring you just can't wait to get to the end of it.  If you want something fast to add into an existing routine a couple times a week, this is the one though.      In my 30 days of using this consistently, my arms and shoulders toned like I've never been able to do before.  My legs did not see much improvement, I did not notice any weight or measurement change.  I'm OK with that!  I will bust out this DVD when I can't get to the gym because of a sick kid or a scheduling conflict.  It is fast and easy to fit in after kids are sleeping or during a nap time.  I don't think you will meet anyone that says this is an easy routine, but I'm sure you can find many that think it is boring!  I say buy it, but don't think you will want to continue to do it regularly after your 30 days of shredding is up.
B002YIHO7I|2.0|I think there is a lot of blind reverence in the reviews that I've read. I anxiously awaited the release date and picked it up that same day.  I have listened to this CD multiple times since, and I cannot get past the third track without losing most, if not all, interest in hearing the rest. This recording sounds phoned in from a group of artists that I have had the highest respect for throughout their careers With their previous work, all of the albums seemed to have a flow and depth that I do not get at all from this CD. I always thought the previous recordings never seemed long enough because they were so engaging.  This CD never lets me back in after the 'Babyfather' track. I read a UK review that claimed that this particular track is one of the \\"jems\\" of this record. LOL!!! Weak! I'd vote it the worst track they have EVER recorded.. When I hear this track, it has me wishing I were somewhere else. By the time my shock and embarrassment of how terrible \\"Babyfather\\" is wears off, I realize that the following track, called \\"Long Hard Road\\",(and a fairly nice one), practically passes me by before my head clears. After that I feel that it's all down hill to the end.
0385504225|3.0|Once again, Dan Brown kept us entertained on a long car trip--this time with his latest thriller, The Lost Symbol.  Read by Paul Michael, I found The Lost Symbol riveting, although it was not without some issues.<br /><br />Peter Solomon, director of the Smithsonian and also friend and mentor to Robert Langdon, begs Langdon to come to Washington, DC for a speech. The original speaker had to cancel, to Solomon taps Langdon--a Harvard professor and symbologist.  But when Langdon arrives in DC, Solomon is nowhere to be found.  Instead, the professor finds a cryptic message inviting him to solve a puzzle.  Solomon has been brutally kidnapped and his safe return depends on Langdon solving this puzzle. The kidnapper, Mal'akh, is a33rd Degree Mason and is searching for the \\"lost symbol.\\"  Legend has it that the ancient mysteries can be found at the bottom of a staircase under a giant pyramid in Washington, DC.  Langdon, with the help of Solomon's sister, Katherine, begins a quest to find the ancient mysteries and to save his friend.  At the same time, CIA director of security, Inoue Sato, is trying to stop Langdon, claiming this is a matter of national security.  Langdon doesn't know whose side she is on and if she can be trusted.<br /><br />As with all Dan Brown's books, he introduces us to many buildings we never knew existed and/or treasures in places with which we're familiar.  It was a nice change for Brown to focus The Lost Symbol in our nation's capital.  However, as for issues, I didn't understand the whole motivation of Mal'akh or how retrieving the lost symbol would transform him into a god.  Also, the whole subplot of noetics (Katherine Solomon's field of study) was totally unnecessary and I felt that it added nothing to the story.<br /><br />Despite these problems, The Lost Symbol is still a good story.  I look forward to my next trip to Washington, DC to see some of the places that Brown wrote about.
B001PA0FFO|2.0|Masterfully portrayed, Doubt is a somewhat disturbing film to watch.  Not because it doesn't spell everything out for you, but more in the way the characters are set up.  Everything in the Catholic realm is decaying, right down to the paint on the walls.  The hip warm priest is attacked without any compelling evidence, only intuition of a fire-breathing dragon of a nun.  The new sister is innocent, gullible, inexperienced and conflicted, but very lovable.  The most moving part is the conversation between the mother of the school's first African-American student and Sister Aloysius, who is sharing with the mother her suspicions of improper affections on the part of the priest toward her son.  The mother doesn't want any kind of action to be taken, for fear of that the abusive father might kill the boy for carrying out his inclinations with the priest. You can't stand Sister Aloysius, and yet you suspect that her suspicions are well-founded.  The disturbing part is that you feel you are being encouraged to side with the mother and the priest, since this is more modern and acceptable these days. I'm still not sure how to respond to this film, which might well be the intent behind it.
B001FB4W0M|5.0|I highly recommend season 4 of Supernatural.  My husband and I have seasons 1-3 on DVD.  The only thing my husband didn't like about the blu-ray vs. DVD is that there isn't a \\"play all\\" option.  You have to go back to the menu and select each episode that you want to see.  The quality is very good though. We watched the whole season in about a week, it was really good! I can't wait for season 5 to come out on DVD/Blu-ray.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|The central conceit of the film is that we are watching footage retrieved from a handicam belonging to a member of the public and found by the authorities at a location \\"formerly known as Central Park\\" after an event code-named Cloverfield. The footage follows a group of six odious yuppie friends whose evening started off at a surprise farewell party held at a giant downtown loft for one of their number who was due to start a new job in Japan. Their self-important world is then thrust into a bleaker reality as a huge thud shakes the city and the embodiment of a collective nightmare arrives in a furious rampage of violent destruction. Monster shaped it has been called al-Qaedzilla by some, others merely scream \\"Oh My Godzilla!\\" All we have to go on is the frenetic, dizzying hand-held footage, no explanations just the fearful claustrophobia of the lens' parameters.     As the city is ferociously assaulted by this seemingly vengeful beast the images of the destruction look chillingly familiar as streets serve as focused conduits for choking toxic dust and masonry. No accident, some scenes could easily be that first news footage from 9/11 which has led most to conclude that the monster is an allegorical terrorist. But could the partnership of Producer JJ Abrams who together with writer Drew Goddard brought us the twists and turns of Alias and the maddening mysteries of Lost really be so simplistic in Cloverfield?     Seeming to appear from nowhere the Cloverfield monster is apparently impervious to conventional weaponry and seems to be driven by unrestrained rage, making us mindful of the monster from the id, (in the 1956 sci-fi classic `Forbidden Planet') a manifestation of the unconscious. In an age when the propagation of fear is used as a form of social control and given liberties are taken away, could this monster represent the terrible collective rage of a whole national psyche, symbolically ripping the head off a hollow statue of liberty and tossing it away as one of it's first acts?     Perhaps the famous New Yorker, American icon and poet Walt Whitman lends his weight to these ideas. In his poem \\"Give Me The Splendid Silent Sun\\" which contains the line `Keep your fields of clover. . .\\" he says;-     \\"O I see what I sought to escape, confronting, reversing my cries.    I see my own soul trampling down what it ask'd for.\\"     So be careful what you wish for!

B002XMGGJM|5.0|Monster on the Loose with Vengeance!... for the Saw Era. Rage is the way it starts and then procedure, then rage, procedure...and so on. Revenge film poses better than its sleazy heart. It's like \\"Jason\\" in court and fighting the system with a \\"Jigsaw\\" presentation. It's like Death Wish Science Fiction Fantasy played out as real. Blue-ray is muted but looking the high G it is. Sound isn't showy, but is crystal clear even when booming and zapping with interest.<br />It's a lot of fun. You will be inrtigued. perhaps shocked or bored; depending on taste.

B00338QENI|5.0|You know you are dealing with evil money hungry Drs. when the Nazis twin experiments sound in line with the theft of this patient's cells. I disagree with the other reviewers as Lacks was no victim but a fierce mother and brave patient who not only had to find and diagnose her own tumor but bear medical atrocities and neglect at the hands of yes, American doctors. Skloot is a stellar writer as in the telling of the howling storm on the day of her funeral just 60 years ago foretells the insane cloning, Obama advocating stem cell nonsense and other joke science that has NO proof per Michael J. Fox that they can cure diddly squat but let's steer billions and ignore ethics to advance phony monster mash science. Revolting way to steal from her family when they never got a dime. Shame on us all.

B002LL13AM|1.0|I'm heartsick over this version of Bach's WTC Book 1.  I've been anxiously waiting for this recording ever since I first heard rumors that Pollini intended to record it.  Unfortunately and astonishingly, the sound recording quality is just abysmal.  I can't get beyond the sound quality to actually *listen* to Pollini's interpretation.  Deutsche Grammophon really let all of us who love Bach and Pollini down.    My recommendation--don't spend the money--it is an unlistenable recording.
B0013ND36G|2.0|T3 was disapointing for me, it didnt have that same flavor from T1 and T2, sort of cheesy feeling. Cheapy flavor. its likes coca cola, and other sodas tryin to imitate such as pepsi. it doesnt have the same ingredients. not a good movie.
B000N3SRRC|3.0|Inititally I was a little let down with this album as the meter and feel of the lyrics seem the same from song to song. After a few listens though I began to appreciate what Clutch is trying to do here but this outing is no Blast Tyrant. In the context of the entire Clutch collection and dare I say their age the album makes sense, but Beale Street is not their best or a must have for a newer fan.  This album is gritty, feels less produced and a little rushed in places. This dirty feel may be what the doctor ordered as it is more like what you will find at a live show and should be much easier to reproduce live. Clutch likes to save some of their more interesting pieces for the last track and this one is no different. Mr. Shiny Cadillackness is pretty cool and leaves one wondering where the album could have gone if they used that song as a launching point. White's Ferry, a slower song, is a nice surprise and The Devil & Me and Electric Worry make you remember why you fell in love this band. When you get used to greatness as Clutch has been pumping out in prior new releases, good just doesn't feel like enough, but From Beale Street to Oblivion is a good album.

B001BMXFX0|3.0|The first 180 pages seemed filled with page after page of strong story lines that kept you interested..Her main charactor, Suzie Salmon, and the viewpoint she chose for the book to take on with this charactor were equally as good.  Having the girl who had died in the beginning and watching her family and other events from here heaven was a real good focal point for the writer, Alice Sebold to have chosen.  Having her often engaged with her family and friends that still were earthbound was a very good way to keep you interested..Susie becoming involved in the position of indirectly aiding her family and friends through her traumatic experiences on earth and how to find the missing links...But after strongly engaging me for the first important pages, the book took a real boring turn for almost the next 100, wish I had to push myself through..Too many sentences that were not fully leading to anywhere but another boring one.. The grammer and editing definetly needed work..<br />Finally, in about the last 80 pages or so the book came to life again with an unexpected surprise that did help get me back on track, but then the strong ending I had expected just was not there..At least for me, I am hoping the movie which encouraged me to purchasing the book is much more engaging and better flowing.<br />If you are a reader of this writed than you will probably feel differently...Long book, so I expected better, but I may be willing to try another book..
B002NWRMVS|5.0|The Fall is Norah Jones's fourth studio album.  For this record, she's chosen a slightly different direction than her previous releases.  The Fall has more of an art-rock sound it to it, probably the result of Jones's decision to have Jacquire King produce the recording.  According to interviews, Norah is a big fan of the Tom Waits' album [[ASIN:B00000IGGA Mule Variations]], on which King was an engineer.  Along with King, Jones also enlists Waits collaborators Smokey Hormel and Marc Ribot on a few tracks.<br /><br />While the tempo of the music hasn't changed from her previous albums, The Fall is darker lyrically and musically.  The songs may not be fast, but they have an intensity like a slow burn.  Jones's voice smolders over each track, landscapes of distorted guitar, echoey piano, and distant drums.  Her songwriting has improved with each release and some of her best work is on display here.  She chooses songwriting partners well, such as Ryan Adams (\\"Light as a Feather\\"), and Okerville River's Will Scheff (\\"Young Blood\\").<br /><br />If you purchase the CD version of The Fall, be sure to download the Amazon exclusive track, \\"Can't Stop\\", which is so good that I can't fathom how she decided to leave it off the album proper.  It certainly makes for a better coda than the canine ode \\"Man of the Hour\\", by far the album's weakest moment.  Here's hoping Norah continues her musical development and releasing beautiful albums like The Fall.
B000002UHG|4.0|I purchased this record with great expectation and at first was somewhat disappointed. But slowly and slowly I started getting into it and it has now become  a favorite of mine. I think that this record would appeal to those who enjoy listening to recordings of The Pink Floyd such as Ummagumma. For those who on the other hand prefer the Dark Side of the Moon or the Wall sound ( which is not my case) I would not really recommend.  All in all, a very interesting recording.
B009A87ZKG|4.0|I dont think this is the remastered blu-ray it looks the same as the old blu-ray disc theres nothing on the box saying its remastered so i dont know.
B002BWP4A6|3.0|So, I decided to see this movie after watching its review on At the Movies.  What struck me was A.O. Scott's sour reaction to Haneke's films, for what he described was Haneke's tacit statement that European liberalism stems from a guilt over the Holocaust, the World Wars etc.  I don't know if I'm missing something, but I didn't pick up on that at all - in either this movie or his previous one, Cache.    I left the movie with more questions than anything.  What is Haneke trying to say about the roots of German fascism?  Is he trying to say anything at all?  The only thing I took away from the movie was an eerie appreciation of the repressed sadism and evil percolating in this small town.  Those kids are really creepy, and that physician is devoid of humanity.  May be someone with a better understanding of existentialist or nihilist thought would more appreciate this film than me.  Nonetheless it cultivates a spookiness, a malaise I haven't experienced in a film for a long time.  Overall, it's worth seeing but jeewiz it felt really long.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|This album was a long time coming, and worth the wait. HIM has once again proven that they can do no wrong.  \\"Screamworks: Love in Theory and Practice\\" showcases the talents of the band members and delivers satisfaction to those who desired and anticipated it's release.    Ville Valo's voice is at the peak of perfection, ranging from heart-stopping, romantic crooning to visceral screams that conjure visions of medieval torture devices and the final ecstatic embrace of condemned lovers. \\"Dying Song\\" is my favorite among favorites, with it's almost unbelievably touching melody and lyrics.  \\"In Venere Veritas\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard.  \\"Like Saint Valentine\\" delivers the usual power-driven sound that everyone expects of HIM, causing the floors to quake while taking one on an aural thrill ride.  Valo wanted this album to have a direct, 80's feel, and it does, without sacrificing the true HIM sound. Guitarist Mikko \\"Linde\\" Lindstrom outdoes himself on this album, proving to be one of the veritable greats of his profession. He takes you on a personal tour of 80's rock then leaves you breathless on the altar of the Guitar gods.    There is really too much to this album to discuss in one small review.  It is an intricately woven web of pleasure and pain, and it hurts so good.

B001NEK2GE|4.0|I've had my Gamepad for a few months now, and my general impression of it is good.  You can bind 22 keys, and then the little keys next to the analog stick, and by pressing the analog themselves reaching a total of 25.    Initial setup of the product involves downloading the Logitech software, including a demo, the lcd manager, and the agent manager which is how you bind keys.   Binding keys is quick and easy in the software Logitech has made, and it also includes a few built-in settings for some games if you are intimidated the first time using it.  The LCD on the actual unit is a pain to configure, it would never fully save the settings I had, but there really is no use for it. Sure, you can view the song you're listening to in-game without tabbing out, but you can't play/pause/skip which makes it rather useless. On that note, I also had issue with the Gamepad saving the keybinding I had set, it usually wasn't an issue but if turned off the computer it seemed to reset and had not saved the profile to the onboard memory as it's supposed to do. The M1-M3 are different profiles you can save, in the Amazon picture the color of the keys is white, theres a standard color picker in the keybinding software that lets you change it to about anything you like. (Which only looks nice since you're not going to be staring at a key saving wheres G7... considering you dont see the bindings in game as G7)  The keys feel great when pressed and have a nice size, but the overall construction feels weak, with the hourglass form it feels like dropping it would snap it in half, unfortunately I did drop it once and the metal pad on the bottom seems to be a little loose now (the fall was just off of my desk, about 3 feet.) All and all, this is a critique aiming at narrowing out the bad features, and I can tell you this thing is great and the only thing you really need to consider before getting it is...  The Analog Stick is terrible!  It's incredibly small, I don't have very large hands but I find it uncomfortably small, not to mention jump is usually keybinded by clicking the analog stick, which is awkward and hard to press resulting in numerous deaths due to missed jumps. I ended up keybinding my jump to G21, I like it more in that position, but having a worthless key is worthless. Due to this reason, I can't recommend using this in a FPS game as you'll probably end up crashing into a wall or running off a ledge.    I tested this playing World of Warcraft and Team Fortress 2, this is a great product. But, I would advise getting something like the Razor Naga, keybinding is a little harder with it, but you have access to the keyboard which allows you to say keybind 1-12 in WoW, and then Shift + 1-12 which in essence can give you a greater amount of keybindings at your fingertips (unfortunately the buttons on the Naga  are small.) I tried using both side by side for about a week and I ended up taking the G13 to my closet. The G13 is a great product, but in the end I'd suggest a fancy keyboard or mouse. (The Naga is currently $8 more on Amazon and is well worth it.)  P.S. I had a lot of people in game ask me how I used this, the most common set up is to place it to the left of your keyboard and play with your left hand on the gamepad. Assuming a lefty uses the mouse with their left hand on gamepad on right, I'd advise against this, you would not have access to the analog stick or the 2 keys next to it, and you couldn't rest your thumb on it making it very uncomfortable.

0880790121|3.0|I saw the Sun card from this deck online and fell in love with it.  Without researching further (like I usually do)  I raced to amazon to purchase the deck and book. ( I had a gift card just waiting to be spent!)<br /><br />Before I finish this review, I will admit to my love of colors and happy things.  And I will say that the creator of this deck did work hard.  I love the concept of the Rose Mandalas.  And some cards are really stunning.  The aces, in particular.  And Death.  I love the royal purple of his robe and the crescent moon as the blade of his scythe.  And, of course, the Sun card.<br /><br />Unfortunately, even though there are cards I really vibe with, there are many I just don't.  I can't seem to get past the fact that none of the cards with people on them have eyes.  Just an empty white void.  It creeps me a bit, and gives the entire deck a darker feeling then I like my decks to have.  I was disappointed because had the rest of the deck been in keeping with the hippy, colorful sun card, I would have loved this deck.<br /><br />But I understand that choosing a deck to read from is a very personal thing.  Someone else just may love it.  The artist is talented, and i can see from careful study of each card that there is much going on.  The companion book is an enjoyable read.  It just is not my style.
031236198X|4.0|Our Iceberg Is Melting is an easy to read book with a very sticky message that makes it incredibly useful for helping people quickly understand, internalize and remember key change factors.  In fact, we gave the executive steering committee of one of my clients the book on a Monday, and by Wednesday of the same week the book had already influenced the language of the team as they began to make references to Fred and NoNo in a steering committee meeting.  The book provides explicit and implicit lessons around the importance of communicating tough news and the need for change, engaging a broad population in being part of the solution, finding wins for key resources that help them embrace change, training people to be successful in the new environment and getting people excited about getting there.  Our Iceberg Is Melting is a good resource for any change leader.

0316010669|4.0|I am still on my Malcolm Gladwell kick.  What I enjoy about his books is that he finds the most interesting and quirky research to educate me about.  You will learn things from this book that you aren't likely to learn in any other way.  that being said, there are whole paragraphs that are redundant and extraneous and you can just skip over.  I was fascinated by the research on race and instant recognition.  I was also interested by what he learned about the Millennium Challenge and about New Coke.  Very interesting stories and the idea of thin slicing is definitely something to consider.  This book is worth your time.

The expanded version with the added 28 minutes will be released on dvd on 11-16-2010, in both a 2 disc set, and a blu-ray version.  Both of the new sets seem to contain the same extras: one 50 minute documentary on the making and restoration of the new version, and the other an interview with the curator of The Museo del Cine in Buenos Aires, who was instrumental in bringing the expanded version to the light of day.<br /><br />The blu-ray version has a lenticular (3D-like) cover.<br /><br />Whether blu-ray will improve the film remains to be seen. My own experience has sometimes been that  the blu-ray effect essentially produces a grainier image on old films, which I don't consider an improvement. So I'll wait for some reviews to come in before I buy. But in any event, this is a must-have in one version or the other. (The new version will be shown on TCM in November by the way).<br /><br />05-2010 UPDATE: I saw the new expanded Kino version yesterday here in New York at Film Forum. It includes the 20+ minutes of \\"lost\\" film found in Argentina last year. It clocks in at about 2:30+. The new segment quality is very poor (its in 16mm), but it does allow the story to make sense (well almost), and the score is fully integrated. So all the talk of the original being \\"lost forever\\"  were a bit premature. And I bet that somewhere there is a complete 35mm print waiting to be discovered. (The 16mm print was in the hands of a private collector in Buenos Aires, so anything's possible !).<br /><br />In any event, a blu-ray version is being released soon. So keep an eye out. This is an amazing film on many levels (and I generally dont like science fiction at all).<br /><br />ps:  Three Cheers For Kino !<br /><br />--------------<br />The NY Times reports an additional 20+ minutes of the original film has been discovered. Its 16mm, and has been integrated into the 32mm version now most generally available...the new version actually synchronizes with the original score ! (Google the story in the NY Times, week of 02-13-10)<br /><br />Its been shown little so far in 2010, but I have no doubt it will receive dvd release after a brief  theatrical run (how many people have even heard of this film in this, the age of Avatar?).<br /><br />In the meantime, I'd avoid all these lousy copies of a copy of an \\"enhanced\\" copy (who's doing these enhancements by the way? I have software on my computer that is supposed to enhance videos, but I'm not rushing out to hype my version of old public domain films).
B00000IFP6|4.0|This set begs to be listened to in its entirety as a study in performance.<br /><br />It comes across as young, almost improvised.  It has funny little crescendos and cadenzas, and occasionally uses period-instrument sounds (twanging strings, alternately broad and stopped horns) within a generally modern ambiance -- most of which I loved.  Changes in articulation are everywhere and may be in the urtext, but they also add to the rebellious atmosphere.<br /><br />The miking and mixing put you in the middle of the orchestra so that you get interior voices like crazy.  Passages that the tympani own under Furtwaengler belong to the violas here.  For some reason the first horn plays offstage most of the time (maybe there was a union problem), but the second horn has a nice, fat sound.  I think they were seeking a chamber orchestra sound much of the time.<br /><br />The tempos are not all fast -- the last movement of the 5th is one of the exceptions -- but the generally quick readings give the listener a chance to see what parts of the Beethoven symphonies \\"work\\" in the baroque-classic idiom where the line stands out above everything.<br /><br />My conclusion is that the symphonies are pretty much all possible in that idiom, with the interesting exception of the 6th.  I think the 6th is one of Beethoven's spatial works, like the first movements of the 9th symphony and the \\"Moonlight\\" sonata, where there has to be room between notes and a sense of sonic depth and layering.  This set creates that space in parts of the first movement of the 9th but never finds it at all in the 6th, which loses all coherence.<br /><br />While emphasizing pace and line is frequently possible, that doesn't mean it's right.  Scales are not glissandi and semiquavers are not grace notes; there are sections where this set mixes these up.<br /><br />The inceptions of instrumental notes and their sustained middle parts have very different sounds.  When fast tempi eliminate notes' middle parts, the music's sonic character changes.<br /><br />Who was it who said that music needs space to breathe, Bruno Walter?  But speaking literally, you can't accelerate the heartbeat and breathing too much.  This set frequently leaves the human listener behind.  If you were introducing a new listener to Beethoven's music, you might want to choose an old favorite instead.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the set is an interesting experience and has many cool and perhaps unique moments.said that music needs space to breathe, Bruno Walter?

B002XMGGJM|4.0|Overall a good simple thriller with a few twist and turns kept me entertained.  Not overly complicated but very entertaining.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This mic is a great deal for the price. I was looking at several others, including the A-T 35S, which is really the last model of this unit. its been discontinued, but is still for sale, and at a higher price than this one is. Easy to set up. I have a Canon Elura 90 camcorder and I needed it for some videos I was doing for a Digital Video class. The audio came in clear, although mono, not stereo.     I transferred the video via Premiere Pro, and as you should, or maybe not, know that in Premiere Pro you can force the mono audio into Stereo. So no need to buy a seperate adapter to plug in. I just did it in Premiere. I only had my subjects 6 feet from the camera, so the 20ft cord wasn't fully needed.     I wanted a wireless lav, but was iffy on the [...] ones for sale. For the price, its great. I too wish that there was a light for the battery level, but oh well... You cannot go wrong with this unit.
B002VECLVO|5.0|This film took me by surprise.  Being that this was Tom Ford's directorial debut, I didn't know what sort of expectations, if any, I should have had.  That speculation was a profound waste of time.  I like a great many movies but I love only a handful and this one falls squarely in the center of the latter category.  I found it a profoundly lyrical and human exploration of the weight of loss, of the way we try to continue with a life that is now seemingly foreign because it is so jarringly incomplete; a study in reflective motion - the stranger in the mirror that shadows us.  We witness how from the moment he wakes, George struggles to just exist in the most normal sense rather than live in the more extraordinary one.  As he states early in the film \\"You see, my heart has been broken.\\"  However, we not only see it, we come to feel it.  We are wholly sympathetic to him because, in many ways, he's all of us.  Just like his loss, George's pain is universal and through that hole in his soul, we enter and come to know him. Colin Firth's performance is superb; a walking testament to weary resignation and automatic reflex.  He operates by rote and instinct, struggling to reach the end of every minute of his day.  The clocks in his world move ever so slowly and the monotone tick of the seconds hand reminds him just how much more of the day still looms darkly before him.  Firth walks that very tricky tightrope with a character that can very easily become the embodiment of all that is maudlin while simultaneously failing to elicit even an ounce of compassion from the viewer.  Caricature is one misstep away but he doesn't come anywhere near that pitfall.  George is a sad creature, no doubt, but he's not pathetic; a dignified streak runs prominently through him.  To those outside his reality, he's the same George they've always known and he dutifully embraces the charade.  As his longtime friend, Charlotte (Charley), Julianne Moore delivers with her customary and unerring brilliance.  Donning a first rate English accent and a sense of frustration for her ill-conceived affection for George, she struggles alongside her friend to hold on to a world that is slowly leaving her behind.  Nicholas Hoult is a revelation as Kenny Potter, George's student; a young man whose own sense of isolation draws him to George and his detached and well thought out approach to life and human interaction.   In him he finds a kindred spirit.  As Jim, George's  partner of 16 years whom we get to know almost exclusively through flashbacks,  Matthew Goode offers an honest portrayal of someone whose capacity to love and be loved forever transfigured those around him.   Now let us move onto Tom Ford.  Where has this man been hiding all these years?  He was born to direct.  His unfailing attention to detail, his ability to frame a scene is fluid and innate.  People go to film school for years for one third of what obviously comes naturally to him.  From the first scene to the last, the film pulsates with a lyrical quality that renders it a true work of art and not just another movie.  He has certainly set the bar very high for himself.  Directorial debuts such as these, are rare indeed.  We're not talking Redford in Ordinary People because for more than 20 years he stood in front of the camera.   Ford's screenplay adapted from a source that many considered unfilmable is yet one more achievement.    The art direction is another major player in the film and it is spectacular, indeed.  Both interiors and exteriors brim with authenticity and impeccable taste.  The same is true of the music score by Abel Korzeniowski  and Shigeru Umebayashi.  Though somewhat minimalist in nature it was far warmer and more melodic with just the right amount of melancholy underpinnings.  Why this film wasn't showered with Oscar nominations I'll never understand because it more than deserves them.  To say that I loved it, is an understatement.  A Single Man is, without question, a true work ofart.
B000ELJBAA|4.0|Released in 1984 at a controversial time for Pink Floyd and produced by Bob Ezrin, this is David Gilmour's 2nd solo album. The guitar work is brilliant as always and David's voice and lyrics are quite in good shape too. While I wouldn't rate it as high as 'David Gilmour' or 'On An Island' it still manages to capture my interest and I do revisit it from time to time.  This remastered edition does improve upon the previous one, the music sounds stronger and the instruments are clearer for sure. The booklet provides all lyrics and there are quite a few pics of David during this time. I'm glad to have replaced the version I had for this one.
0061537934|5.0|I just finished this book and   found it to be a heartwarming story of a relationship between a dog and his master. Since it was written from the dog's point of view, it caused me to think more about the inate intelligence of \\",an's best friends\\". I am a dog owner and will never look at my dog the same way again. It also tells of the personal struggles of a man who learns lessons from being a race car driver. In the end, he learns never to give up and it pays off royally in the end. I read it slowly but finished it in a morning. It was a great story and truly inspirational.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Not entirely sure why people are leaving their impressions of an album on the day of the album's release...    Now, I'm a big Sade fan.  I absolutely love her.  She's sultry defined.    That said, I was disappointed... DISAPPOINTED... when i first listened to this album.  I couldn't \\"feel\\" her.  But this is Sade...    And this is her best album yet.  Continue listening.  Her rhythm has changed slightly.  It's an evolution.  Once you listen a couple times through, you'll see that this is the same Sade you've fallen in love with countless times before.  She's just older, wiser, and mellower.    She's jazzy.  She's sexy.  She's Sade Adu.
0756405890|5.0|\\"The Name of the Wind\\" is a very good book.  The characters are well defined and leaving you wanting to know more.  It has adventure, love, betrayal, and magic.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Dollhouse was one of the best new sci-fi shows. A great premise, terrific writing, and a great cast, how can a show as great as this get canceled? I can only believe it's because sci-fi fans didn't find it in time, which means poor marketing. It is worlds better than the sci-fi shows that are being renewed.Ever wonder if they don't do as much publicity for the good shows because they expect word of mouth to save them, while with the bad or mediocre shows all you get is advertising? I think this is why the better shows get canceled and we're left with the others.    So, we only have 2 seasons but they are 2 great seasons.     The only negative comment I have about it is that 2 seasons weren't enough.
B001KRVLCI|5.0|Will be a classic good guy/bad guy flick. Great action by great, professional actors with great supporting cast. One of my all-time favorite Nicholas Cage movies.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|The SB-400 is a great quick and light but functional Speedlight. After receiving the product and testing it out, it doesn't make a difference compared to the built-in (popup) flash on our Nikon D80 in all situations. It does add light in further off shots better than the built-in and also removes shadowing (created by the lens) because the flash sits up higher on some shots. The best feature for the price is the ability to bounce off ceilings to get better lighting which works well on this product.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I really enjoy this CD altough I wish it had less \\"church music\\" but I guess she was playing to her strength.  Her \\"How Great Thou Art\\" is awesome.  Look forward to the next album.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This was a gamble purchase of mine.  I purchased it on a whim. Mainly I based my purchase on what I read on the box. What a great gamble. The footage is titillating to the eyes and mind. Scenes like a shot of forty birds and the camera zooms out to four million birds.    I ended up watching this entire series in a weekend. Time well spent. It's great for children and students of all ages. Most of the time I watched it with my Step-daughter and we both enjoyed it. She's loves animals, so that worked out just perfect.    The series touches on just a few things things that our wildlife has to offer.  But the subjects are quite informative and visually stunning.  The first episode, \\"Pole to Pole\\", gives a slight preview on what's to come. Starting from the Artics to the tropics. Documenting some of the most intriguing animals and places our planet has to offer. It gives you a real appreciation for our planet's wildlife.    A must watch/purchase for any wildlife lovers. I'm currently on my fourth time watching it through.  Just can't get enoough of it. You remember or learn something new everytime.
006621131X|5.0|I've been a fan of Patti Smith since purchasing Horses in 1975.  I love her approach and delivery of literate music that does not let you be passive is listening.    The book struck me as the best \\"true love\\" story that I have ever read.  It's rare to read about a contemporary couple as unconditionally loving as Patti and Robert.  Patti captures the sweetest, smallest moments that live on through their years together and apart.    Her touchstones brought back so many memories.....  I used to travel to Rather Ripped Records in Berkeley, barefoot to find her music and rare imported reggae music.  Although, I was in San Francisco, I felt a kinship with the New York scene that she so elequently describes.    After reading this book, I love, and appreciate, Patti even more than I have the past 35 years.  Thank you for a wonderful book that reinforces the notion that true love exists.  You have done Robert proud.
1400052173|4.0|As another reviewer noted, I worked with HeLa cells in the late 70s and people in the lab knew at least the donor's name at that time, so when I saw this book appear on the market, I jumped to learn the rest of the story.<br /><br />That, you'll learn.  As noted, some parts were more interesting than others, and the book reads a little faster if you can skim.  Life can get really hard when your mother dies young.  Cancer treatment is bad enough now.  It was brutal then.<br /><br />I would have been interested in a little more cellular biology, explaining why the cells are so different.  Guess that's somebody else's book to write.<br /><br />My own life has taken me in and out of the orbit of the Bethlehem Steel plant at Sparrows Point more than once and reading this book could, I suppose, count as one more iteration.  Amazon lists a few books about that plant, perhaps as culture-changing in its own way as Oak Ridge but vastly less glamorous.  If Henrietta's husband had taken a job in a cigarette, textile, or furniture factory in the south, we might never have had the medical results generated from work on HeLa cells.<br /><br />If you do research that takes you anywhere near HeLa, your peers and your clients will be reading this book.  Find a copy so you know what they're talking about.
B001IAOEXU|2.0|Used them for 5 matches of Call Of Duty MW2 and just didn't do nothing to help my game out! It was worth a shot for only $5.00 may work for you.
B001QGRIO8|5.0|I can't believe anyone would give this whole series less than a 5 star rating.  I finished the first both on feb 4.  The second book started 2/7 at 1030pm fishes 2/8 at 11am book three Started 2/12 finshed 2/14 and started this last book 2/14 and finished 2/16 - only due to the size of.  My only problem is there is no more to read!!!!!  I loved this series... and have started reading it over - which I have NEVER in my life done before.    I hope she has another series like this soon!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|this arm did exactly what i wanted it to do. Easy to install and easy to use
B0009UC7HA|5.0|This is a fun movie, with a little bit of common sense, and thinking involved.  Compare to a cross between MacGiver and Indiana Jones.  Lots of fun for a date movie!
1591843162|5.0|Linchpin delivers!  Godin's perspective, always fresh and eye opening, offers  ideas about how to create meaningful work in any job, any setting.  He bodly suggests we take responsiblity for ourselves in our work - that we can't count on our employers to do so.  No doubt the economy has permanently changed and therefore the old ways of viewing employment are not suited to today's workforce.  I've been working since I was a 12 and by 50, I'm a bit tired of it.  But, not earning money isn't an option for me.  Linchpin offered many thought provoking ideas to make my work more meaningful and satisfying and the courage to branch out in new directions. I intend to strengthen the organizational culuture to reward this type of work behavior.    As an employer, I am well aware that the colleagues I mentor and encourage to develop their potential have and will continue to use those skills to move on to new challenges.  I'm OK with that because giving is a circle and they'll contribute to our community (in the global sense) in other settings. My organization can't create the ideal job for everyone forever.  Therefore, I have recommended Linchpin to all my colleagues and am not the least bit concerned that they'll all jump ship. Instead, I believe that most of my colleague will find ways to strengthen aspects of their work with us, to enhance our services and perhaps branch out in some other endeavors on their own.     I'm envigorated in my work and in my life as a result of reading Linchpin and expect the same for the majority of readers who have the courage to look at the current realities, the future and take charge of themselves.

B000K7VHH8|5.0|if Amazon,com wasn't as full of idiots and jackasses, and had the decency to address the problems of their customer, many of which Amazon creates for them, then people would be able to buy things and have the confidence of knowing that they could buy safely from them. I'm going to Buy,com and see how they treat their customers.
B00319ECHE|5.0|I was honestly very close to giving up on FF.  Non of their work after Obsolete, in my opinion, was very good at all.  But, I heard a couple tracks from Mechanize and decided to buy it and I'm so glad I did!  If you love Demanufacture and Obsolete as much as I do, then you will not be disappointed in this album.  I highly recommend.
1594489505|5.0|It's a book that change your life and the way you look at the history of Afghanistan... This book has been and incredible incentive for me to make some research on the development process in this middle east country and the way gender relations and religion can affect economic growth. I strongly recommend the reading of this book.    Also, the way Hosseini writes is amazing! He can make you jump, cry and be exited just with words... you can actually see it in your mind.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I wasn't sure that I would be able to read this book, just because of the subject matter.   I am so glad that I did. I enjoyed the story, and I could see myself reading it again.
B002UXRH10|3.0|I miss the \\"Rocker Chick\\" of the previous CD. Perhaps the recent personal events are to blame for this muted tone. Altogether a \\"Good\\" compilation. I look forward to her next offering.
B00003CXBK|1.0|This movie didn't make any sense to me, except for the tree/nature hugging undertone. It seems all over the place with storylineS. I wouldn't be able to explain what is the movie about if I had to. Is it about the kid from this long lost tribe and his coming of age? Is it about Iron Town and the exploitation of nature and its resources? Is it about giant wolves and pigs/demons?...among other possible themes. I didn't get it. But the animation sequences get the only credit, in my book. I say rent it first then decide if you want it in your collection.
B002QEISMA|4.0|This Riverside import took Amazon a little while to deliver, but it was well worth the wait. I've been listening to Riverside for about 5 years now, and \\"Anno\\" is without question Riverside's finest release to date. The songs are extremely proggy, very heavy, and full of Riverside goodness. You can't go wrong with any Riverside release in my opinion, but \\"Anno\\" is Riverside at it's very best...    As for the live DVD portion of this import, I wasn't very impressed to be quite honest. I think Riverside needs work on their live sound, and more time practicing. It wasn't a horrible set, but I thought they struggled to pull off a convincing effort here. I was expecting more from them live I guess...    CD: 5 STARS / OVERALL: 4 STARS    ~MJ~
B0002IQEHI|5.0|With a classy Bernard Hermann score, Hitchcock lets us in on the story of an advertising exec, Mr. Thornhill, who likes his job, considering advertising as exaggerating the facts for the public.<br /><br />(Hitch makes one of his famous on screen appearances, and doesn't quite make the bus!)<br /><br />It's fun, though a bit unrealistic, that an advertising man who was just kidnapped would then follow up on the guys who tried to kidnap him, investigate the hotel room of the \\"real\\" Kaplan and go through these adventures. But that's fine, it's still a lot of fun.<br /><br />Each scene has him take a step closer to finding out more about the kidnappers, narrow escapes, chase scenes and thrilling near-misses.<br /><br />The cinematography is superb. The 30th floor view as Thornhill runs out -- the unusual perspective shots, the mistaken identifies and mistaken situations -- the logical illogic, the puzzles and the plots and plans -- All doves together in a crescendo of simple if deadly delights for the viewer.<br /><br />But not for Thornhill.<br /><br />[Some minor plot reveals here]<br /><br />A blonde on the train (but who is she, really?) a little romance & comedy adds to the grim specter of a very long jail sentence or the bad spies rub him out!<br /><br />Best scenes of course include:<br /><br />The biplane scene that sprays bullets rather than insecticide on our poor Mr. Thornhill.<br /><br />The Mt. Rushmore scene that has lots of near misses and very tall heights to climb and nearly be killed by, especially with Martin Landau chasing you down!<br /><br />There's a double-cross, there's James Mason (as actually the evil spy Van Damme), lots of near misses -- I keep saying that but it's true. The film is full of near misses!<br /><br />Recommended, highly so.
1400049628|5.0|This was an awesome read! Very quick and fun, I read it in less than a week (its about 250 pages long with a few illustrations). The book covers everything you could need to know in the event of a zombie outbreak: what to have, what weapons to use, where to hide, what to eat, how to get around and most importantly: how to most effectivly kill the living dead without becoming an undead coarpse yourself! The book also covers the different levels of zombie outbreaks and a chronological history of all recorded zombie attacks. The book is written in a completely serious manner and the author doesn't let the fact that zombies don't exsist impeade his abillity to write the perfect zombie survival guide. This guide will have the most cynical reader questioning if they are ready for the coming zombie apocalypse. But fear not, as long as you have you copy of \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" by Max Brooks, you will be prepared to survive the slowly advancing hoards of the undead!
B001U6YI92|2.0|Well, The poor picture quality of this release can be that it was shot in Techniscope, which is a early version of Super-35 that uses a smaller amount of the full 35mm aperture for economy during shooting. You will notice that the first three of Leone's films will always be of slightly lower picture quality due to the fact they were all Techniscope releases. Now, Once a Upon A Time was shot in Panavision which is full 35 mm scope quality. It should look great on BLU-RAY. Don't always blame the studio, It can only look as good as the original negitive. Peckinpah.

B002QW7AJY|3.0|the movie is good, and that is why i bought it.  However, the Blu-ray version came with a digital copy that is only compatible with Windows, so its useless to me... Read the fine print before you buy!!!
B000I0QKDS|3.0|Energetic if predictable blues-rock, Beck's influence is deserved but an esteemed debut is little more than dirty-white blues 101.

B000JIHP88|5.0|As a Grandmother of twin girls. I can tell you this is the best investment I have made thus far, and I am a Grandma so you know I have made many..lol The mobile makes the girls happy and they light up when they see it moving and the leaves going up and down. The characters are so cute and colorful. This mobile would accent any decor!! I had the old wind up type prior to receiving this one, and though it was cute, it always annoyed them both when it stopped, along with the loud clanking of winding it back up,  the disturbance of CLANK, CLANK, CLANK was both annoying and inconvenient. This wonderful mobile buys me the time that I need to prepare bottles, or change a diaper while the other is enjoying the music rainforest show!! I love it because they love it, it is convenient and the babies sleep so well undisturbed. With twins, one baby can easily awake the other, but with one tiny click the soothing music begins and the characters move around and they are back into their peaceful sleep. Fisher Price I have always loved your toys, and grew up with them myself. I am impressed with the way you have kept up with new and innovative ways of entertaining babies/kids. You have really outdone yourself with this mobile and I love the crib aquarium soother of which I will be leaving a review about as well. Thank you from my twins and I!! Amazon, you again exceeded my expectations by delivering my package BEFORE estimated delivery date. You have outstanding service and deserve KUDOS as well!! I see a long relationship into the future!! :)
0375842209|5.0|The Book Thief  By: Markus Zusak  Illustrated. 576 pages  Alfred A. Knopf.  $8.63  (Ages 13 to 18)       Neil Sheth, HLW- 2  Ms. Hagberg- Cohen  02/16/10     Markus Zusak, an innovative and poetic novelist, tries to compel the reader with his mesmerizing and creative story along with implementing poetry and suspense in this historical fiction novel.   Zusak, an Australian author, grew up hearing stories about Nazi Germany and knew it was a story he wanted to express through his poetic language. \\"But there were still rebellious children and people who didn't follow the rules and people who hid Jews and other people in their houses. So there's another side to Nazi Germany,\\" says Zusak. Through his implementation of suspense, the so- called literary phenomenon is almost an unfolding path in the reader's mind.   Although Zusak brings about a novel that brings a story to life in one's mind, the message that the submerging narrator, Death, imposes is somewhat unclear. The purpose of incorporating a narrator with a different perspective is an innovative pizzazz to the story, but the message still lies vague. In this historical fiction novel, a moral of some kind is what perfects the comprehension of the time- period, and of the writer's abilities.   Creative writing is one of Markus Zusak's strengths, especially evident in The Book Thief. Zusak presents a myriad of accounts from his mother in Germany, and compiles these small explanations of human interactions into an amazing masterpiece of historical fiction. Tying together these stories is what needs to be reinforced for the reader to grasp the meaning of the story. The love that the family and the Jew create is binding even through the pages of the novel. Zusak entices the reader through suspense, sorrow, and exuberance in this composition.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Although the general plot of Avatar has been filmed many times before, the vivid, imaginary world created by Cameron transcends the predictability of the story line.  When you sit down to watch this film, particularly if you are lucky enough to see it in 3-D, you won't care that others have compared it to Dances With Wolves or Princess Mononoke or any other white man versus indigenous people/nature because you will be swept up by the fantastical landscape and the particulars of the indigenous culture.  Once you are immersed, you might even forget that this world, Pandora, does not exist, not even in some remote place on earth the way New Zealand stood in for Middle Earth in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.  Avatar is that convincing.<br /><br />The basic plot, with no spoilers:  Jake (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed Marine with the same DNA as his recently deceased twin, arrives on Pandora, a planet described as a \\"hell hole,\\" to take his brother's place in an experiment.  Scientists, working parallel to the military and to a private venture seeking to obtain valuable ore, have created a hybrid body made of human and indigenous Na'vi DNA to allow the humans to intermingle with the natives in a kind of half-anthropology, half-diplomatic effort.  Jake exceeds everyone's expectations as he finds himself in the middle of the native culture, part of an inner circle that believes he has the blessing of their god.  As these story lines tend to go, the greedy villains try to use Jake for their own purposes while he begins to realize that this alien people needs his protection.<br /><br />Steven Lang is wonderfully snarly as the Colonel, a man who values no one above himself.  Sigourney Weaver, while not at her best, provides a decent portrayal of the principle investigator running the avatar project.  Zoe Saldana (who played Uhura in last year's Star Trek) provides the voice and computer data points for the face of Neytiri, the young Na'vi woman entrusted with Jake's education; although we never see the actress for real, she is very much part of the success of this film.<br /><br />The 3-D experience was breathtaking -- literally.  The scenes on the edge of high drops as Avatar Jake and Neytiri leap from place to place gave me the same sickening experience as if I really saw two people close to the edge of a cliff.  And the real-ness of Pandora was enhanced by given the impression that I was actually immersed in this imagined world.  Of course, when the DVD is released, viewers won't have any of these sensations; however, the beauty of Pandora, with all its wonderful and dangerous creatures, should still be conveyed.  If you haven't already seen this film, you should, whether in 3-D or 2-D.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmanner see the actress for real, she is very much part of the success of this film.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love sci fi.  I love the new Star Trek movie and the great cast that gave us insight to McCoy, Scotty, James T. Kirk, Spock and on and on.  I loved it!  What ever could match Star Trek?  Answer, Firefly.  I loved Battle Star Galactica, hated seeing it end.  What could match Battle Star Galactica???  Answer, Firefly.  Like another reviewer I wish I was on board when it first came out.  I wish I could've joined the fans that tried to keep it going.  I want more Firefly!  I noted the great music in it.  Did Battle Star Galactica have the same composer or did they just realize it had a great score and emulated it.  I'm so glad I watched it all.  I want more.  I guess I already said that.  When I was first told about it, a western sci fi show, I didn't think I'd like it.  Boy I was wrong.  I love the premise.  I won't try to explain it here.  But I get it, I love it!

B0001611DI|4.0|So we started watching ALL of Romero's films.  Dawn of the Dead is even better than Night because it's more sophisticated.  I think it suffers from some of the same problems with drag and cheezyness.  This movie could be at least 40 minutes shorter and there are major gaffes like distinct zombies that have been killed early in the movie appear again in mob scenes at the end, like the dead guy with the rifle and the nurse zombie.  Also, some of the heros do incredibly stupid things.  Rodger could have been bit (so he could turn into a zombie) without suddenly becoming an idiot.  And what was the deal with the bandito jamming his arm into the bloodpressure machine and sitting there for his reading while zombies closed in all around him?  I guess it was supposed to be funny.      Despite all of these criticsms, though, Dawn of the Dead gets four stars from me for a lot of really spooky imagery, blood-pumping action, characters you want to root for, and originality.

0553385461|4.0|Questions about the universe have intrigued intelligent individuals throughout human existence. Luckily for our time, these questions are no longer confined to the realm of philosophy and speculation. Science has come a long way and may now provide basic answers to these questions. Unluckily, answers given by science are usually too technical to be understood by anyone but a small population of experts. This created a need for simplified texts targeted to the general population. Of course those texts can't wish to provide more than a general appreciation of modern scientific theories making many of them rather superficial. On the other hand, delving in the details would do nothing but put off most readers. Achieving balance between clarity and detail is therefore the hallmark of a good general science book.     This book by Stephen Hawking is certainly one of the most remarkable books in this category; definitely a classic! It is informative, clear, easy to follow and a whole lot of fun to read. The book sacrifices detail for simplicity making it ideal for people with little or no background. Nevertheless, there is enough detail to keep the more informed reader interested.     The authors' goal of making the book as \\"brief\\" as possible came with heavy sacrifices. First: some topics needed more explanation to make them accessible to the uninitiated reader. Second: many interesting topics related to quantum mechanics and string theory were not mentioned. I would have preferred if they opted for writing \\"a more detailed\\" history of time rather than \\"a briefer\\" one. That said, the books still accomplishes a lot for its size and the minor amount of time one has to spend to get through it.    BOTTOM LINE: If you are looking for a first book on the implications of modern physics on our understanding of the universe, I can't recommend this one more. If you have read similar books in the last five years, I can't see much that this book can offer.

B0001ARCFA|5.0|I had never Lou Reed's breathing.<br />I did now. And it's oh so crisp!<br /><br />As soon as I took this out of the box (which says Made in Austria, by the way, meaning auto-awesome), I played \\"Transformer\\" and it sounded, well, like it was meant to sound.<br /><br />These are big, but extremely comfortable. They're not \\"stylish\\" in the way that some headphones are, but they're great if you plan on wearing them for hours on end, especially when you're mixing stuff.<br /><br />I'm no audiophile, on the contrary, I'm deaf. Just kidding. But these are my first actual studio Headphones; I've recorded my own music for at least 10 years and am quite content with lo-fi equipment, but now I realize having great a great monitor is essential, otherwise it's like getting dressed in the dark and not having a mirror to see how you look.<br /><br />Either way.

B002N1AERI|4.0|As a connoisseur of the genre tentativly entitled \\"Symphonic Metal\\"  for many years (my first contact was with Nightwish in 2003), I have listened to many bands either fronted solely by men (Kamelot, Symphony X, Sonata Arctica,etc) or by a more female focus (Nightwish, Delain, Tears of Tragedy,etc). The middle ground, or B&B (beauty and the beast) as it is usually reffered to, highlights and contrasts a male and female voice. Not being much of a fan of the Beauty and the Beast method with which After Forever in particular mixed heavy grunters and female Opera vocals, I avoided Epica with a passion.     Lucky for me, I happened to be listening at a friends computer and overheard Never Enough from Epica's album The Divine Conspiracy. Suffice to say, I decided to give them a second chance and so I bought The Divine Conspiracy. I ended up loving it, but due to the length of many of its songs (which were extended because of the repetitive and dull riff sections put in for grunter Mark Jansen's vocals and further exacerbated by the lack of guitar solos) ended up not listening to many of its songs more then couple of times     Hearing that the ex-God Dethroned death-metal drummer Arien van Weesenbeek would be joining Epica's current line up of Simone Simmons(vocals), Mark Jansen (rhythm,vocals), Yves Huts (bass), Coen Janssen (piano) permanantly with his shredder buddy Isaac Delahye, I waited with baited breath to see what Epica would do with their fourth studio album, Design your Universe. Having listened to the album five or six times by now, a couple of design changes to the epica universe (damn, that was a terrible pun) have definitely lifted Design Your Universe up and above all of Epica previous albums. Unfortunatly, despite these changes and improvements, it still suffers here and there from some of the problems I have come to associate with Epica.    Pros:  1- Guitar Solo are finally here! Isaac clearly decided that it would be quite boring to stand around riffingfor songs of 10 minutes in length without some variety and so almost every song features a fantastic solo.  2- The song melodies are brilliant for the most part, and as a drummer, I find the drumming incredibly varied and unique.  3-The lyrics, which I could wax upon all day, are of very high quality despite some questionable writing in the song Kingdom of Heaven   -Man: I don't want to return. Don't make me go back!    -God: Go back! You've got work to do.  Otherwise, stellar.    Cons:  1- With the joining of ex-death-metal players, Epica seems to dive even deeper into the Beauty and the Beast contrast, and in my opinion, this is usually a bad thing. Though in a few stellar tracks, the duet is perfect and Jansen helps the tone, most of the time his grunts are the same, and become annoying quickly.  2- The mixing in previous albums always put the guitars in the back of the mix, making Epica sound overly symphonic, and lacking in power. However, though this problem is rectified in Design, it is way overboard. The guitar riffs tend to drown out the piano and keys, and lessen the impact of the choir. I would prefer is somehow they strike a more perfect balance between the two on Epica's next album.     Song-by-Song:    1-Samadhi (Prelude) - Very soundtrack-esque song, built as the album introduction. One of Epica's best instrumentals, and even manages to incorporate melody themes from the song Resign to Surrender into its end structure. 5/5    2-Resign to Surrender - (A New Age Dawns Part 4)-  Mark Jansen continues his theme of the fall of Mayan civilization that he began on the album Consign to Oblivion. This song begins with a powerful choir, and then jumps into a driving metal riff. Mark's vocals are actually distinct and you can hear what he is saying clearly. I wish all the songs had this clarity; it would make the grunts more tolerable. The guitar solo is fabulous and as it is the first on the album, it made a particular impact on me. A brilliant, albeit heavy, opener. 5/5    3-Unleashed- I am sick and tired of people calling this song a \\"poppier\\", single oriented track (as if that makes it any less then the other songs on this album). It has heavy riffs, double bass, and a rousing powerful chorus. Though more approachable then most 10+ minute epics, it is in no way less then many of the other songs on Design. I loved its transition into an almost Sharon del Adel (from Within Temptation)fluttery bridge. Great song. 4/5    4-Martyr of the Free Word - Easily the heaviest song in Epica's library, it reaches almost a thrash metal pulsing beat remnisce of bands like Metallica and Slayer. This does not lessen the incredible lyrics and melody's. It has literally the best contrast of B&B in the end of the chorus, where the music drops out for a second, and then explodes with Jansen. I can't get enough of it. 5/5    5-Our Destiny- The rhythm on this song is really great and the melody is, once again, distinct and lovely. It also is Arien first major break from explosive double bass, and makes the song more relaxed (as much as you can be on an Epica album). Great shredding by Isaac once again. 4/5    6-Kingdom of Heaven- (A New Age Dawns Part 5)- I have very mixed feelings about this one. Although it clocks in at 13 minutes (and though I love songs like Poet and the Pendulum and Ghost Love Score from Nightwish that are also of this length), like The Divine Conspiracy (song) I feel that it just can't hold up overall. The lyrical choices are not nearly as strong as the rest of the album, and the abrupt time transitions hurt the overall dynamic of the song. It also wears out its welcome far before the end, despite valient lead guitar bits by Isaac and fascinating Saamba style beats from Arien. Majestic and very different, but far less enjoyable then the title song. The melody is also weaker then some of the other, shorter tracks. 3/5    7-The Price of Freedom - One of the coolest interludes I have ever heard (and I have heard A LOT of Kamelot), this 1+ minute song starts with piano and melds in voices of charismatic leaders in America. I think I heard Obama, Martin Luther King Jr., and Kennedy. 5/5    8- Burn to a Cinder- very eastern styled singing and really powerful choir. Fun, great guitar solo, a little long at 5:41. 4/5    9-Tides of Time - the first ballad of the album, it is a gorgeous song where Simone Simmons shows off her dynamic control of her opera/classical vocals and her prettier (and though I want to kill myself to admit this) \\"pop\\" style. Beautiful, moving lyrics and a slower emotional guitar solo justify the length. 5/5    10- Deconstruct- Mark's voice is low enough that I barely noticed it, but is somewhat unnecessary. Solid song. Not much to say, besides that I love what Simmons does here with the jumping verse and chorus. Shorter for an Epica song at only 4 minutes. 4/5    11-Semblance of Liberty- here is where Epica breaks what they had fixed for Resign and Martyr. The opening is awesome, but then it moves into a jumping and tedious riff. Changes time all over the place, but not in the best way. Mark dominates this song so much it reminds me of the failure Menace of Vanity from Divine Conspiracy. The use of George H. Bush in the lyrics is cool, but the lyrics on the whole are not great. The length is also a bit much. I guess some metallers might like , but I really didn't enjoy this one. 2/5    12- White Waters - the second ballad on the album, featuring a nice duet between Tony Kakko from Sonata Arctica and Simone. Nothing to go crazy about, but pretty and short. Interesting airy dynamic on Simones part. I like Tides a little better. 3/5    13-Design Your Universe-(A New Age Dawns Part 6)-  The title track, and the coup de grace of the album, Design attempts to put everything that makes Epica a standout in its genre into this song. Powerful and driving, Simone's parts mainly consist of very dynamic and softer vocal pieces, but the orchestra and Mark are the focus of this one. I wish Simone had done a duet with the choir after Marks chorus like she does live, instead of leaving them on their own. Much stronger song then Kingdom of Heaven, and does more with its length then Kingdom does. Despite being over nine minutes, it holds it all together and finishes Epica's album with a bang. 5/5    14-Incentive (Bonus Track)- Coming after Design Your Universe, and featuring a full-on metal song featuring Mark solo, I really felt it was anticlimatic. Not a very good song in my opinion. 2/5    -56/70 total including interludes and bonus.  -44/55 without interludes and bonus    Overall, I found Design Your Universe to be a well-designed, innovative album. Epica is clearly pushing boundaries, and unlike The Divine Conspiracy, it doesn't feel forced. With great variety, powerful riffs, GUITAR SOLOS!, and Simone Simmons shining with her usual grace, this album is a must for Symphonic Metal lovers. I just hope that on their next album they balance the mix a little more, and use Mark the way he is in Resign to Surrender and Martyr of the Free Word; more understandable and with better contrast to Simone. Don't be afraid to buy this; it's worth it! Support a great band!
B000058T5E|5.0|If you don't own this, play LOOSE CANNONS for 10 seconds to find out all you need to know about the cd. IT should be titled JUST LISTEN, cause that's all you need to do. This is not jazz, not the rockabilly cd he did 20 yrs ago, this is hard rock done by a master guitarman! I have no doubt that a blackbirdstopped at his windowsill while he was plugged in, applauded with his own tweetstyle, and Jeff answered back. I'm sure this is what inspired Blackbird. That bird flew higher & more majestically than usual that day. I'm also quite sure that 4 birds showed up the next day at the same time, just like we do. You don't have to be a birdbrain to know you need this CD, just listen...

B0030BOCKK|5.0|This record is like fine red wine. It needs to breathe awhile, and then all of its notes unfold. It took about 10 listens before I could write an honest review. Not as hard as Venus Doom or commercially appealing as Dark Light, its more of an exploration of the pain of love. HIM always implys these themes, yet this time they have taken it all the way. My best way to describe it is a big, dark, scary fortress with a 1000 rooms of horrors. These horrors are something we love to watch, like an old gothic flick on late night TV.     Each track is driving. Electronic beats finally make an appearance. Rich production values deliver that classic HIM sound. The songs have familiar camp, yet serious lyrics abound. Love is painful, yet its rewards are worth it. Katherine Wheel stands out as a big concert anthem rocker. The rest of the album drives us to a happy ending-well sort of. The Forboding Sense of Impending Happiness shimmers and leaves us with promise that the dark canyons of human emotion are worth exploring. Indeed, for those lovelorn goths, this album becons them to enter the vast fortress and get lost in it.

0545123267|3.0|So my book bully has been telling me to read Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater almost since she first read it last May. But the arm twisting didn't fully start until after she read an Advance Reading Copy (ARC) of Linger, which is the followup book that is due to hit shelves this July. I've heard mixed things about Shiver so wasn't entirely sold on it but not one to resist my book bully for long I decided to pack it on the plane with me for my trip to New Mexico.<br /><br />My first thoughts on Shiver was that the storyline was a little slow. I kept waiting for something bigger to happen but it never came. At about 1/2 way through I was texting my book bully asking what the deal was with the werewolves staying in MN. I mean if the change is triggered by cold then why not move south? Seems logical to me. Her response was to just wait. And so wait I did. And an answer did eventually come but I can't say its one that makes any sense to me. I don't agree with it on many levels, but its the answer that I am stuck with as that is what Stiefvater came up with. Though my initial response when I did read Stiefvater's answer was \\"WTF? Seriously?\\" and that is still what I think when it comes to it.<br /><br />Overall the story wasn't bad but I am not one of the hundreds of Shiver lovers out there. The writing was solid but the world building was just so-so. Grace and Sam often came off as pretty two dimensional. I also hated the utter lack of presence of Grace's parents who were like cardboard cutouts staged just to show that she had parents but they didn't add any depth to the story. I'd be amazed if they had though as they had absolutely no depth at all. Saying all that though I didn't hate the story. I'm kind of ambivalent to the whole thing with no strong emotions either way. If I didn't pick up a copy of Linger at ALA then I'm not sure if this would be a book series that I would continue. But since I do have Linger I feel as though I should give it a shot....eventually.<br /><br />As originally posted on my blog Ticket to Anywhereon my blog Ticket to Anywhere
B0030BOCKK|4.0|Have been a more than casual fan of HIM through the years.Being I only purchased Dark Light and this one...& soon-to-be purchaser of Venus Doom...This new album kind of reminds me,anyway,of Dark Light.This one may have a more mainstream sound which I know was intended.More upbeat and slower ballad-like.The album should win over Dark Light purchasers as well as Venus Doom,which I will probably buy soon.Songs of note are...In Venere Veritas,Scared To Death,Heartkiller,Dying Song,In The Arms of Rain,Ode To Solitude & Acoustic Funeral...Buy it and you will not be disappointed.

B001GCUO4S|1.0|The first three FINAL DESTINATION movies were very good, creative, imaginative and well done.<br />We own all 3 of these in our DVD collection.<br /><br />The latest addition to the series is pretty much crap.<br /><br />Bad casting and acting (none of the characters are memorable and you don't really care what happens to them).<br /><br />The violent deaths are too obvious, silly and gimmicky as though they had to find excuses to include shots that would work with 3D.<br /><br />This latest movie seems more like a parody or a cheap imitation of the original Final Destination idea.<br /><br />Really bad.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I've just begun it but give this book 5 stars because it provides some context for The Girl Who Played with Fire, which stands very well on its own but benefits from the 'so that's why!' of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />The characters are brooding, full of back story, and complications but they're intriguing enough that you hang on for their actions and reactions.  Plot moves at just the right pace - slow enough to get a sense of the actors but not so slow you'll want to skip ahead.<br /><br />This book is about a guy who starts off on what you might suspect is the typical hero's journey but you'd be cheating yourself to dismiss so tightly woven a thriller.  Buy this and read it over time.
0312370849|3.0|I am pretty ambivalent about this book. From reading its description and reviews, I had some very high hopes. Unfortunately, the execution of its premise fell flat. It was quite predictable. Not to mention, drawn out in all the places where it should have been succinct, and succinct where the ideas should have been expanded upon. The entire first half especially had this problem - the chapters set in 1942 were so much more vivid than their 21st century counterparts, and when they abruptly ended, it was disappointing. And Julia's character... was somehow not fully fleshed out. I will say that the ending and the hints of what happens after the pages finished was the most satisfying part of the whole novel. Really, what ruined it for me was the slow tearing of the Band-aid in learning Michel's fate... it was inevitable, predictable and utterly too drawn out to be actually moving.
1906694176|5.0|The third book in the trilogy by Steig Larsson is an awesome conclusion to a fantastic read. I would recommend that anyone who has not started this trilogy to do so ASAP for unbelievable intrigue.  I understand it has been made into a movie in Sweden.  I'm hoping it will be released here at some point.  It will be interesting to see the character of Salander on the screen.
B0030BYWKK|1.0|This band is terrible, just like every other group from the same town (denton, tx). Every single record this band puts out is trash, and their \\"hipster\\" fans really love how the vocals sound like a bad and EXTREMELY irritating immitation of thom yorke, because all the snot-nosed little \\"indie\\" hipsters know that you have to make your voice sound irritating to be \\"cool\\" Their lyrics are a complete joke too. The only thing remotely good about this band is that their compositions sans vocals arent too bad, but until they release this record with the singing edited out, avoid this band and other \\"indie\\" hipster groups like the plague.    If you want to hear something that's actually avant-garde and innovative, listen to jazz.
B002VWNICW|2.0|Austen races through time in her novel but this movie version skips many good details sadly. This is just, \\"Rich man falls in love with poor woman.\\" Obviously the star is Knightley but in the original BBC movie (still the best) and the book it is both Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. The lines were so fast here it was like having a finger on the fast forward. The Bennet's were not so poor that they had pigs in their living room; they were upper middle class so this version is just an \\"updated\\" fast forward through Cinderella-type story lines. Key lines were said so quickly there was little enjoyment. Better to read the book or - still better - go get the 1995 version with Ehle and Firth. Far, far, far better and much more realistic and true to Jane Austen. I'd hate to see this cast do other books that require time - Gone with the Wind or War and Peace. Ghastly.
1594488916|2.0|While the title seemed intriguing, I found the book to be uninspired.     In my opinion, the thief, who is the inspiration for the book, lacked complexity and quirks that I would have expected in story about rare book theft. He was uninteresting to me nearly from the outset, and brought no drama to the story. He's just a guy who doesn't have that 'moral' gene.    The detective (bibliodick) Ken Sanders was an interesting character, and I'd definitely have written the book with Ken as the centerpiece, just following his life in counterculture, his lifelong love of books and finally his career as a rare book dealer.    I'm sorry to say it, but I wouldn't recommend this book.
B00132D808|5.0|Someone mentioned Panic! to me since they know I also like rock bands and the greats such as The Beatles.    And The Beatles and other influences are all here.  They are not trying to be The Beatles, but their is the homage and songwriting structures.  Put away the thoughts of thinking of them as just trying to be interesting and non-formulaic and you will enjoy the CD.  Other influences also come through.    I didn't know what to expect when I purchased this, though I had heard \\"Nine In The Afternoon,\\" but from the first song I was hooked.  It is a short piece \\"we're So Starving\\" and from the moment they say \\"you\\" about 30 seconds in and then weave the next you into another beat, well it just makes you have to listen to the rest of the record to hear what happens.    A great mixture of sounds, tones, harmonies and taking chances, though some may be familiar, they still make for a great CD.  I have not listened to the earlier records so I cannot make a comparison to what changed or other material they have done.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|This film is downright excellent. The thing is, you cannot walk out of the theater, no matter how horrible it seems for an hour. The ending comes around and all is explained, illuminating the audience as to why it seemed so horrible for awhile. Watch this movie; you'll love it.

B002Y5FKUE|4.0|I loved Natalie Dessay and Juan Diego Florez in Donizetti's La Fille du Regiment by the Royal Opera, but I have to agree with the majority of reviewers that Bellini's La Sonnambula is based on too weak a premise to carry a two hour opera and that the production was flawed. I have no problem with the modern dress (actually I prefer it), but starting with a dress rehearsal just doesn't work. Despite the excellent music and singing, this version of La Sonnambula seems to go on forever. But I eagerly wait for the next appearance of Dessay and Florez in, hopefully, a better production.
B000N3ST9I|5.0|Now that the first 10 years of the 21st Century have passed, looking back at metal music is interesting.  It started with \\"nu-metal\\", then \\"metalcore\\" and finally \\"deathcore.\\"  Each of these genres started fresh, but quickly got stale.  Only a handful of albums from this decade will stand the test of time and be revered for years to come.  And The Blackening is one of these few gems.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000D96NW Through the Ashes of Empires]]was in many ways Machine Head's return to form.  After [[ASIN:B00005A46S Supercharger]] and [[ASIN:B00000JLC4 Burning Red]] disappointed, it was a major breath of fresh air for the band that got the wheels in motion towards a return to their roots.  TTAOE is quite good.  The Blackening, however, is phenomenal.  Machine Head took everything that was great about Ashes and just enhanced it.  It has been about 15 years since a metal album came out that packed a punch like this one.<br /><br />This is that rare album that plays start to finish without letting up at all.  The structure is similar to [[ASIN:B000002H33 Master of Puppets]], which the band has often stated as the major influence for the album.  This is only 8 songs.  Not a single track is filler.  From the multi-dimensional opener Clenching the Fists of Dissent through the amazing closer A Farewell to Arms, this album does not let up. In between, gems like Now I Lay Thee Down & Wolves take a bunch of wonderful metal twists and turns.  Halo, which has one of the best riffs you'll ever here, brings the album to a massive peak, and yet it doesn't fall from there.<br /><br />The album's shortest track is 4:46.  There is nothing on this CD that was aimed at all towards mainstream radio.  Growing up on Metallica, Slayer & Pantera albums, it is beyond refreshing to hear a CD come out in this day and age that joins their great CDs in my playlist.  Genuinely, this is the first real \\"classic\\" metal album in a long, long time. Machine Head not only made an album that brings them past their mistakes, but it somehow manages to surpass their earlier accomplishments and sit atop the pedestal as their greatest acheivement.  For a band that has been around for over 15 years, that is quite an accomplishment.  Highest recommendation!somehow manages to surpass their earlier accomplishments and sit atop the pedestal as their greatest acheivement.

0312370849|4.0|Although \\"Sarah's Key\\" does not measure up to the compelling \\"Suite Francaise\\" (Irene Nemirovsky, published 60 years after her death, in 2006), it pulls up the curtain on a little known historical event.  In 1942, the Parisian police rounded up thousands of Jewish families and forced them into temporary living in the Velodrome d'Hiver, an outdoor stadium in the city that no longer exists.  Thus began the Vel'd'Hiv - an episode of infamy in French history, where an estimated 13,000 Jews were imprisoned, families split up, and everyone who survived the initial roundup transported to Aushwitz.  The children were almost immediately sent to death camps.  Because the Nazis played no physical role in the roundup (they code named it \\"Operation Spring Breeze\\") and the mission was carried out by the French, many of those descended from that time in France have hidden the story of Vel'd'Hiv as even more repugnant than the more well known episodes of collaboration by the Vichy French, led by Phillipe Petain.  It is said that the Nazis initially had given no orders to round up the children, but that Rene Bousquet, head of the National Police in France, expanded the order to include the children.<br /><br />In the novel, fictional 10 year old child Sarah Strazynski tells her tale, having been forced from her Paris apartment with her family to the Velodrome.  She makes a catastrophic, life changing choice to save her young brother, which haunts her for the rest of her life.  The author, writing as Sarah, is compelling and emotional.  Less so, is she true to her craft in the alternate story of current day American journalist Julia Jarmond.  Jarmond learns Sarah's story when she is given the assignment of writing about the Vel'd'Hiv tragedy and learns that her in-law's apartment, where she is to move, was a Parisian \\"spoil of war\\" that came free for the family after the Starzynskis were imprisoned.<br /><br />Sarah's story is told in alternate chapters with Julia's. The plotting and character development for 1942 is passionate and pulls the reader in; the storyline for the modern tale of Julia is less so.  Rosnay's true and compelling voice lasts through ¾ of the book, but when the story turns  from Sarah's first person tale to the exclusive chapters where Jarmond overcomes family issues and completes her discovery about what happened to Sarah, it drags.<br /><br />A more than worthwhile read, especially for history buffs.

B000062XGD|5.0|After FedEx systems engineer Chuck Noland is ripped out of his hasty life by the clock in a plane crash, he finds himself alone on the shores of a tropical island. First, frustration gets to him and then he realizes how little his chances are to ever get back to civilization. Four years later, Chuck has learned very well how to survive on his own: mending his dental health, catching fish with a spear, predicting the weather with a self-made calendar. A photograph of his girlfriend Kelly has kept his hopes alive all these years. Finally, Chuck takes the opportunity to take off for home: He sets off on a wooden raft with a sail that has washed ashore. From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival. A fascinating, believable, and thought-provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows you in this movie to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey. A fantastic movie.

1439157383|3.0|Wow, what to say about this book that hasn't already been said from both sides. After finishing over 400 pages of this book, I have to say I'm a bit neutral on how I feel about it. I read it because it's popular. I read it because I like reading, and it was about a particular subject that caught my interest. I wavered between really liking and disliking this book throughout several points during my reading. Having a neutral perspective on this book allows me to point out what exactly I liked and didn't like. Though I seem to point out more cons than pros, it doesn't make my rating shift. I liked this book as much as I disliked it. That's why I gave it three stars.<br /><br />Warning - SPOILERS<br /><br />CONS<br /><br />-Like many reviewers on here have claimed, many of the minor characters were cliched, such as Campbell's secretary and basically anyone else not associated with the little bubble surrounding the Fitzgerald's. What I mean by this is making background characters clueless or just stupid.<br /><br />-The constant \\"Life sucks\\" attitude. We get it, life is hard, but it's hard for everyone, not just the Fitzgerald's. It's as if they're the only people in the world who think they have family issues. They have created this bubble around themselves and only see each other and really no one else.<br /><br />-Campbell's constant \\"He's a service dog\\" \\"BUT YOU'RE NOT BLIND HAR HAR!\\" conversations. I get it, and his lying is funny like the first two or three times, but really, does he have to say it in like every chapter he talks from? I also hate how his lies are so obvious yet no one enforces their rules when they say \\"no dogs allowed\\". They just give in to him.<br /><br />-That Sara learned absolutely nothing throughout the course of the book. She started out selfish and the book ended with her being selfish. There was a slight \\"turn\\" with her the last chapter she was in court but you can tell that she never really changed. What I would have liked to read about was quite a few pages (actually) about Sara reflecting on Anna's death. Instead she only talks about being beside Anna when they pull the plug on her, for three pages. She's obsessed with Kate for 400 pages, but only 3 for Anna. It would have made Sara's character more appealable to the readers if her chapter had been longer. When I read about Sara being with Anna before she died, I didn't feel anything for her. All I could see was her possibly thinking \\"Let's get those organs out now\\".<br /><br />-I know it's Brian Fitzgerald's character that makes him who he is, but he's a weak person and he's not that great of a father. He let's his wife, Sara, make decisions for the family and by the time this book starts their family is already falling apart. They have a son that they have \\"given up on\\", which I find to be really really sad. And by the end of the book, Brian doesn't change at all either. In fact, he turns to alcohol to cope with what happened. The fact that he stays at the fire station just to get away from his family at home is more than enough to let the readers know that Brian doesn't like to face his problems and that he can't be a strong father figure. Picoult tries to make you feel sympathy for him but in reality all I can do is shake my head at how pathetic he is.<br /><br />-Because of Brian's weakness and inability to be a strong, stable father figure, and Sara's obsessive preoccupation with their sick daughter, it makes neither one of them likable characters.<br /><br />-Julia's sister, Izzy, was probably the most annoying and pointless character in the book. She was only in the story for the sanctity of Julia's chapters. I don't care what Picoult had to say about her and Julia in the back of the book. She served no purpose whatsoever.<br /><br />-The work up of 412 pages, sympathizing with Anna, only to be let down by the last 10. Anna only gets 10 pages of sympathy for DYING compared to Kate's 412. You mean to tell me that after reading a 423 page book, Picoult couldn't have at least dragged it out for another 50? At least to let every single character - Sara, Brian, Jesse, Campbell, Julia, and Kate - reflect on Anna's death? Dragging out the ending would have made it better. To just all of a sudden put a HUGE twist 10 pages before the very last page makes what you've just read feel cheap and, frankly, makes it read like a fanfiction.<br /><br />-I hated how, when they arrived in the hospital after Anna was rushed to the ER, how the doctor comes out and is like \\"I'm sorry..now is not the right time but I'll ask anyway. Do you want to, like, donate your brain dead kid's organs?\\" I mean, how CONVENIENT. And the parents don't hesitate when Campbell makes that suggestion. In fact, the very next chapter they're pulling the plug.<br /><br />-Not only is the doctor saying this convenient, but so is the car wreck. Anna signs her papers with her lawyer friend, they're all happy. All of a sudden, out of all the people in town to call to attend a wreck, they call Brian! Anna's own father gets to pull her from the rubble. And why? Because it's more emotional that way. Never mind that it happens to be such a COINCIDENCE that HE gets to pull his own DAUGHTER from a wrecked car. A car that just happened to wreck the same day she won her lawsuit. I mean, I know things like that happen, but it's so obvious that it was just thrown in there for the ending to work. I don't hate the ending because of how it was done, I hate it because it was so sudden. It played out like some cliche Lifetime movie. If she had just slowed down it wouldn't have been so bad.<br /><br />-I obviously missed the moral or \\"point\\" of the book because I thought that Kate wanted to end everything going on. She said she didn't want to die but she was the one that told Anna she wanted to stop. She was the one who told Anna not to donate her kidney. She was the premise behind everything that went on. Yet, she gets away with it, like some evil schemer in his plan to take over the world. It didn't matter whether or not Anna died. Kate still would have gotten a kidney either way. If Kate hadn't asked Anna to not donate her kidney, Anna would have given it to her anyway. And since Anna died she got one anyway. So if anyone should feel bad in this book it should be Kate.<br /><br />-I ended up liking Campbell and Julia more than the main characters. They were way more developed.<br /><br />-The whole \\"stars\\" thing was so boring. No wonder Brian is not a strong person. He always runs away from his problems with a telescope and then starts believing and wishing on stars instead of making decisions for himself.<br /><br />-All of a sudden getting a kidney was what Kate needed. At the end of the book she says she hasn't gone into relapse for eight years, something even \\"Dr. Chance can't understand\\". It makes you wonder if this is Picoult's way of dragging in supernatural phenomena or a bond so strong between sisters that Anna is keeping her alive. I'd like to believe it's the latter.<br /><br />-I find it funny how Brian wanted to stop his son's pyromania but he goes into heavy drinking after Anna dies. Great parenting there. Guess Jesse got his way into a \\"police academy\\" by himself, which didn't seem realistic at all for his character..but I guess anything can happen with Picoult.<br /><br />-I hate Sara Fitzgerald. And I obviously hate Brian more than I thought.<br /><br />PROS<br /><br />-One point I can see is that the family did learn something and it affected them all. Anna was created to help her sister but when she died that impact was so great it tore them up inside. Instead of being torn up over Kate, who they expected to die, it was Anna, and that hit them harder than Kate dying, because it was so unexpected.<br /><br />-The book was indeed a page turner. It isn't really a boring read but there are some things that you just want to skim over because it can be boring or irrelevant to the plot.<br /><br />-I liked the changing of views with every chapter. My favorite point of view was Campbell and Julia, then Anna. My least favorite was Sara. I really hated her. Campbell and Julia kind of brought out the comedy in the book since everyone else was so serious.<br /><br />-I like the emotion and building up of characters, though some were annoying. I did like how everyone had a flaw and how childlike Anna really was. She was ignorant about a lot of things but she did have a good sense of what was going on. Her character was very realistic.<br /><br />-I did like most of the characters. Campbell, Julia, Anna, and Jesse were my favorites, but I can't say that I was a fan of Brian or Sara. They just annoyed me and I groaned every time I read Sara's view because her chapters were always so long.<br /><br />-By reading about Sara and her ridiculous mind frame, it makes you want to raise your own children with all the freedom in the world. Thanks, Sara, you've encouraged me to be the exact opposite of you as a mother.<br /><br />This was overall a decent read. I would recommend it to anyone I know but I personally wouldn't read it a second time. It wasn't a bad book but it wasn't the best; And I don't plan on reading Picoult's other books. Overall, I don't regret reading it. Now on to another read!dney either way. If Kate hadn't asked Anna to not donate her kidney, Anna would have given it to her anyway.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Like many others, I fell in love with Susan Boyle's voice, her humility, her humor, and her courage, when I first saw her on YouTube and then TV. This CD shows her vocal versatility as well.  I don't know how she manages it, but she can impress me with the softness of her voice, and with its power; with its range and with its various emotions. I can't wait for the next CD!  All I humbly ask for the next one is:  PLEASE include \\"Memory\\" (Cats) and \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" (Titanic). Both renditions I've heard from Miss Boyle made me cry, and that's NOT an easy thing to do!
B002L5GQGY|4.0|I have 3 of Joe's albums and 2 DVDs and he's obviously one fine rock/blues guitar player.  Seems like a really nice kid, too.  But there is something, despite all that technique and that voice that sounds like he's been chewing on glass for 40 years that just doesn't seem quite right.  As I write this, the Olympics are taking place and this concert is similar.  The Olympics are about training and discipline from a very young age, leading to that one shining moment, right?  Well, Joe wanted to play the Albert Hall and by god, he achieved the impossible.  With Clapton as his guest, no less.  But that's more about wish fulfillment than music.<br /><br />The music?  Five stars.  Not a missed note in 2 hours.  Utterly relaxed in front of 4500 people.  He barely looks at the guitar; no need.  Two drummers, perfectly synchronized.  Not exactly Ginger Baker on an inventive night but impressive precision.  In fact everything is simply perfect, right up to the end where Joe points his Flying V towards heaven in triumph.  A \\"10.0\\".  Now that he has this out of the way, I hope Joe will use his extraordinary technique to go where no man has gone before, even if it means losing some of his older fans who (like me) long for Clapton to pick up a Les Paul and get back to business one last time.

I found Keanu Reeves' and Uma Thurman's performances both to be a bit 'weak'. But for me, it was (surprisingly to me) Michelle Pfeiffer who really stood out.  Before she gives in to the advances of John's character, you can completely FEEL her pain...that pain of wanting someone so badly...the physical desire...and feeling that you cannot have it. You can see it in her eyes...her mouth...

I had never purchased Michael Jackson's music during his lifetime, so I'm learning about his impact on the culture as I'm listening to his music, watching his work in film and reading about him now.  I found myself, surprisingly, very affected by his death. I wanted to know more about him and his life (and not from the perspective of the media).  Now, as I am learning about him as an artist, I would definitely recommend this book to those who want to discover what he had to say about his life.  He shares personal feelings about himself and his very public friendships. It's a rare glimpse into the world of an artist genuinely impacted by other artists.  The book was written over a four year period starting in 1983 at the behest of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis who was an editor at Doubleday Publishing at the time.

1591843162|5.0|Linchpin is Seth Godin's challenge to do your life's best work. That's big: your life's best work. Its message is that no matter if you're a pizza cook, a shaman or a 30-year Member of the Board, it's time to make something--something that matters--happen. And to make it happen with clarity, with humility and with a generous heart. The book's message is appropriately urgent, because these are urgent times, where molasses-bound mediocrity suffuses the workplace, where convention pulls the air out of the room.    What Godin insists is that everyone is an artist, a person whose unique skills, insights and enthusiasms combine so that they can produce art in their work. It's that pizza cook who discovered that a little chipotle and cayenne in the sauce made people exclaim \\"Wow!' at the tables. Trivial? Perhaps. But not if we all offered our particular art--the essence of meaningful effort--in a world where just getting by is good enough. Seth posits that this art is that special something, something extra--it's what makes a REAL exchange between humans. And that though the offering of art is a gift, it's entrepreneurial too: summoning your best, and giving it has cascade effects, it's generative.      The book extensively addresses the voice that says \\"No!\\" in all of us: the lizard brain. Fear is the lizard brain's song of paralysis; the basilisk that both protects and prevents forward movement. Godin gives workable advice on unclogging the arteries of that lizard brain so that your joints flex toward \\"Yes!\\"     Linchpin is formatted so that Seth's ideas come in blog-bites: chunky canape servings, perfect to roll around the mouth and mind, noting spice and scent. I read it as part of my Slow Book movement: savoring a passage, reflecting on its flavor, digesting its impact--and licking my lips to taste it again.    So, the essentials: Don't settle. Your life is your shot (your cosmic chance, if I can risk guru-rrificness) to make a difference. Going through the motions of your career, your relations with others, your relations with yourself = drag. Making a difference, offering your art through your work and actions = world-changing; indispensable.    I unhesitatingly give this book 5 stars--it's rocket fuel.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|[The following review of James Cameron-directed \\"Avatar\\" refers to the 2-D version of the film.]    James Cameron's hugely successful \\"Avatar\\" is a sci-fi action film that has state-of-the-art visual effects with a \\"Titanic\\"-like storyline. The setting crucial to the story (created by the director himself) is detailed and convincing (visually, I mean), and the film certainly delivers as action spectacle, but Cameron's latest effort suffers from lackluster script (with some major plot holes), one-dimensional characters and overacting from the supports - just like his Oscar-winning film in 1997.    As other reviewers have provided a good summary of the plot, I add only this. Even seen in the 2-D format, the film's visuals of the imaginary star Pandora is staggering. Seen on the big screen of the theater, some scenes (like the bird's eye view of the rocky cliffs and characters climbing them up) might cause you dizziness, though it must be said some of the visuals during the action scenes need improvement. Also, as to the star Sam Worthington playing the hero Jake Sully, he deserves every accolade he has received.    However, the same cannot be said of the script, which looks like a reheated version of \\"Dances with Wolves.\\" \\"Avatar\\" describes the futuristic world in which scientists can create \\"avatars\\" of the native humanoid \\"Na'vi\\" while Jake, a paraplegic marine, has to use a wheelchair. Maybe the contrast, which some viewers would take as inconsistency, was intended as irony. Maybe not. We are not sure because the film's script (penned by Cameron) deals with thought-provoking themes very clumsily, with a greedy big corporate and its irresponsible manager, plus the militant \\"Colonel\\" hired by them, both played by Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang with their over-the-top acting.    \\"Avatar\\" is an entertaining action movie with eye-popping visuals - entertaining as long as you let yourself drawn into the visual world and can accept the heavy-handed storytelling.
0875428940|5.0|This is great tarot deck for beginners and experts alike. This deck expands on the minor arcana by making it just as important as the major arcana. The deck emphasis more on the pagan side, hence the cover picture of the magician being pagan as oppose to the traditional magician. The cards are common size for a tarot deck. I use this deck the most and do daily spreads all the time. This is a good deck to learn tarot with and then move on to the more complicated obscure decks.

B002WCLG3O|3.0|A collection of 8 animated tales set within the Halo universe, Halo Legends offers plenty of interesting material and enjoyable action, which should be plenty enough for die hard Halo fans to dig.  For others though, not so much.  Crafted by some of the top anime creators in the business, Halo Legends' biggest flaw is that the whole affair just feels disjointed, and to put it bluntly, is just underwhelming.  However, boasting some nice production values, Halo Legends delivers in terms of its action content (which isn't nearly as violent as the video games that it has been adapted from) and voice acting, but in the end, doesn't flesh out any more of the Halo universe that one doesn't already know.  All in all, if you're a Halo fan, by all means check out Halo Legends, but if you aren't, then don't even bother.

0812550706|5.0|The book Enders game is truly a spectacular piece of literature, within the cover is a true piece of art, with imaginative settings, creative and interesting characters who really drive the plot, which itself is  interesting with enough detail, and plot hooks put in so that the reader is kept very interested and wants to continue reading, I myself could not find nyself with a spare moment in which I was not reading the book it was so incredible.  The Book Enders game is truly masterful and should be read by anyone wishing for a great science fiction novel with out a boring futuristic super detailed book which puts the reader to sleep, the book is very highly reccomended to any reader.
B002M3SOWO|5.0|I bought this for my 12 yr old grandson. I marked it at a 5 star just for the fact that he loves these books and is actually reading them. In his words this was a \\"awesome book\\" and he can't wait for them to make a movie out of it.
B002E2M5IC|1.0|I have bad news and good news. The bad news: this movie will frustrate you and leave you depressed and hopeless. The good news is that if you buy a used copy, it will probably only have been viewed once. For me, once was one time too many. The story line is awful, there are no likable characters, and no meaningful answers (which is exactly the point of the movie). Contrary to the reviews, there are no funny moments. The lead character is not \\"serious\\", he is a victim of mediocrity with no direction.    If a non-Jew produced this movie, he would be hung in effigy as slimy racist. The feeling you will have after the movie is that the typical American Jew is superstitious, stupid, cheap, and a perpetual victim of his/her own self-destructive insanity. (As opposed to my clearer picture of a typical Israeli Jew who takes responsibility for his/her own destiny to solve any problem to achieve greatness.)    Save your money. This movie is not entertainment. It is not uplifting. It is a devastating slog through the worst that man experiences. It will bring you down to the lowest of lows. Both my wife and I are trying to recover a day later. Run away!
0439023483|5.0|This book is amazing! It jumped to one of my favorite books immediately, following only The Host by Stephenie Meyer.From the moment I started I couldn't put it down. It is suspenseful, action-packed, adventurous, and romantic all at the same time. It is a must read and a must have. 100% recommended!What an amazing writer and an amazing book.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Good afternoon, though not in my hands the product I applied few days ago I sent an email and responding politely to wait until 15 March. It's what I'm doing now. What if I like it better track product at this time you handle orders through a company called Imex, I communicate with them in Colombia, and they said they do not manage your account in our country . Then stayed in the same situation without more information. Any news I would receive it, it is my first purchase through this medium. My phones are: the mobile is 3115542766, and the fixed numbers are 091 3403102 and 091 7723376. Bogota-Colombia.<br /><br />Thanks in advance.

0451196716|5.0|This one didn't give me nightmares like Needful Things, It, and The Stand, but it is gripping in a non-horror way. I particularly liked the way King made the extreme premise of the book seem more and more plausible as the book goes on.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I really enjoy this CD. I watched some of their video on the local PBS channel, but there was a lot of interuptions, and our cable  went off (again) for about 20-25 minutes. Now I can listen to it without interuptions.   If you enjoy Celtic music this one is a MUST for your library.             Connie
B001SN78JO|4.0|If all you remember about Jim Carrey movies are the rubber-faced expressions and sight gags, you'll be as impressed as I was with this film. Here, Carrey adds to his usual repertoire of funny faces by delivering a performance that includes a range of emotions and an insightful characterization of a guy who is willing to admit that he has denied himself many of the things he really wants in life because he is always saying \\"no\\" to the risks inherent in personal relationships.  After missing his best friend's engagement party, he has an epiphany and allows himself to be dragged to a \\"Yes man\\" seminar, where he learns to say yes to everything.  This results in a series of madcap adventures and uproarious situations before Carrey begins to discover that the philosophy does need to be tempered with wisdom.  Lots of fun to watch.
B0011UBDTK|4.0|This is a fabulous t.v. show, in an awesome package.  And this is coming from a man! Amazon once again provided the best price and primo service.  We did have a similar issue that other buyers had, e.g. one of our discs wouldn't work. Amazon replaced the set at no cost and virtually no hassle to us, the replacement worked great. One star ding for the initial product failure.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|Wow this album has been in long anticipation and I believe that it has been released without disappointment. They have seemed to take a slight detour from their basic industrial sound and into something a LITTLE mellower. While there may be some softer songs such as \\"Roter Sand\\" or \\"Fr&uuml;hling in Paris\\" there are songs that are really hard and have a lot of pick up i.e. \\"B&uuml;ckstab&uuml;\\" or \\"F&uuml;hre mich\\" (only available on the deluxe edition). These songs are the reason we love Rammstein. I really appreciate artists that try something new but still have songs from their original style i.e. \\"The Who\\" or \\"O.K. Go\\". It seems that drummer Christoph \\"Doom\\" Schneider has really improved a lot and his double-bass pedal flies off the hook almost this whole album, which in other bands really sucks but here it is actually consistent and sounds good, all in all he has really helped improve Rammsteins' unique sound. Till Lindemann's voice is still good, low, and powerful. Buy this album, it has a new flavor but is still great and original. Take it from an unbiased customer.<br /><br />Pros: - Nice double disc set.<br />-Booklet and box have some very nice images.<br />-The second (bonus) disc has some great songs on it, such as \\"Halt\\" and I am very surprised that some of these are not on the standard edition.<br />-Drummer and lead singer have improved.<br /><br />Cons: -I can see how some will have a hard time accepting the slightly more mellow sound but I like it.

This is the British version, but I assume it's written the exact same, but the book is slightly larger than my previous three, so they aren't a matching set, but that's ok with me.

B002VWONB2|4.0|I won't go into plot details as I'm sure most people are familiar with Casablanca. This review deals strictly with the Blu-ray release. I have seen Casablanca many, many times and can state without question that this is absolutely worth viewing. It is crisp and clean with a depth far surpassing any other edition. The beautiful contrasts between light and shadow are visible like never before. I thoroughly enjoyed every visual aspect of the film. My only \\"problem\\" (and the reason for 4 stars) is the sound. I had to nearly max out the volume of the television to be able to hear the dialog. The first part of the film seemed much worse and improved as the movie progressed. Not sure if it's only my DVD but it was pretty annoying having to adjust the volume controls for the first 10-15 minutes. The problem seemed to recur near the end as well.
034544678X|5.0|The other day, my boyfriends rottweiler-mix came inside, thrilled after just rolling around in the snow.  He barked happily and dropped a piece of his own frozen poo on my kitchen floor with the happiest expression on his face.  I looked at him, mortified, and said, \\"dog, what the HELL are you thinking?\\"  Friends, if you have ever had a moment like this one, then this is a great book for you to read.    I have always had an interest in dogs and dog behavior-- my parents had hunting dogs growing up, and we experimented a lot with different training methods.  Over the years, we used some very good methods but some very ineffective ones as well.  I am finally ready to get my own puppy, and while looking over some books I stumbled across this one.      It is important to note, this book is not a training manual.  The author offers advice, tips and tricks but it will not replace a good obedience class.  This book is a study of dog and human behavior.  It explains in a very academic way, why we do the things we do and how dogs perceive us.  It explains very clearly how we can better understand canine and human behavior to better communicate with our dogs.  It is very academic, complete with references and foot notes.  I found it to be well organized and easy to understand.     I also very much enjoyed the personal stories the author included.  A dog trainer and animal behaviorist, her years of experience with her dogs offer invaluable advice for fellow dog owners.  Without her anecdotes of her own dogs and the dogs she has worked with in classes, the book could have been a little boring.  Instead, I found it to be informational as well as personal and funny.    I plan to go back and reread the book, highlighting the training advice and taking notes.  This may seem to be a lot of work to some, who want everything laid out for them, but this author is clearly a great teacher, and I think the advice in this book is well worth a second, third and fourth read.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Just made the deadline for free super shipping or something like that.  Delivered as promised.  The Beatles Stereo Box set lived up to all the reviews and hype.  The packaging is excellent.  Info books in each CD.  Great deal for 17 CDs.  The remasters sound fresh and clear compared to the original albums/singles of my youth.  My 15 and 9 year old love this \\"Real\\" pop music by people who can actually sing and harmonize.  No wonder this music stands the test of time.  The little videos for each album are a nice touch also.  Enjoy
1423101472|5.0|No spoilers here! I'll just say that Rick Riordan is an extremely talented writer. I loved all his books and got hooked on the series after stumbling across it at a bookstore only about a year after it was first published.     Awesome writer.     Another good novel if you like this type of genre is \\"Mightier than the Sword\\" by Megan Webster. GREAT book. She's a debut author too and I'd expect her book to get really popular within the next year or so.
B002XMGGJM|4.0|I've always loved revenge movies. Just as romantic comedies are a big favorite of many women (including my wife), I am a sucker for a great revenge flick! Some might say about revenge films the same as I do about rom-coms: they're all the same and 99.5% predictable. However, with F. Gary Gray's latest, \\"Law Abiding Citizen,\\" he takes the revenge formula and gives it a twist. Rarely do we see in any revenge film, whether it's [[ASIN:B0000541AN Death Wish]], [[ASIN:B00005Y1UV Eye For An Eye]], \\"The Count of Monte Cristo,\\" [[ASIN:B000XSWVFQ Man On Fire [Blu-ray]]], \\"Kill Bill,\\" or the more recent [[ASIN:B001GCUNYO Taken [Blu-ray]]], where the protagonist becomes so enraged over his/her loss that even though it's driven them to such an extreme as revenge, it never pushes them over that fine line of punishing those who didn't \\"have it coming\\" to them.<br /><br />Well, in \\"Citizen,\\" we meet Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) who's a simple family man, soldering away at his home desk as his adorable little daughter is stringing beads together to create a bracelet. With only a minute or two of dialogue between father and daughter, there's a knock at the door and Shelton goes to answer. Instantly the action begins as two robbers break in, incapacitate Shelton then proceed to rape and murder his wife as well as murdering his daughter. A month or two later, hot-shot prosecutor Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) is trying the murderers in Shelton's family homicide case. Rice regretfully admits to his mentor and boss District Attorney Jonas Cantrell (Bruce McGill, playing the usual smarmy trait invoked in most of his recent characters) that in order to keep his high conviction rate up to par and climbing, he accepted a deal with the main murderer, I mean, suspect Clarence Darby so that he could get a conviction of Darby's inept accomplice Rupert Ames, thus sending Ames to death row. However, when presenting the deal to Shelton, Rice explains that the only way to get a definite conviction at all is to take the deal with Darby, which would only result in him being given a measly five years in jail (for third degree murder). An emotional Shelton disagrees and begs to try for a conviction on both suspects since he knows Darby was the main perpetrator. Rice says the deal is already done and even though it disgusts Rice, he follows through with the deal, even being coerced into shaking Darby's hand outside of the courthouse, cameras flashing away. Then we see Shelton witness this, almost as terrified and betrayed as when he witnessed his wife being murdered, and that, my friends, is when the movie really kicks into gear. That is what pushes Shelton over the edge to exact a revenge plot that sends the entire city of Philadelphia into a panic.<br /><br />Ten years later, Shelton not only takes revenge on the murderers of his family, he holds everyone accountable - from Darby's attorney all the way up to the mayor (Viola Davis) and the justice system itself. So, of course, that means he holds Rice accountable. The film stretches into an enjoyable cat-and-mouse game between Rice and Shelton, but, unlike those previous films I mentioned, there is no absolute good or evil here. The audience is left to feel that Rice can't necessarily be held accountable since he is \\"only doing his job,\\" and it's difficult for the audience to hold conviction for Shelton, an innocent man who lost his entire family so violently. So, in order to ease the audience's minds, the writer Kurt Wimmer ([[ASIN:B001BP4K2M Street Kings (+ Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000FGGE7C Ultraviolet [Blu-ray]]]) sets one particular scene that sets Rice and Shelton apart, assigning a good and an evil. Believe me, you'll know it when you see it. When this scene plays, the audience is left to ask: should a person(s) who unknowingly abetted a known felon be held accountable for the felon's actions? This predicament is explored in all kinds of media, even comic books (i.e., should Batman be held accountablefor all the people the Joker has killed when he could have stopped him by killing him?). The answer is different for all of us and the scene with which I'm referring, screams, \\"No!\\" And in a lot of cases, they may be right. All I can say is that this movie's scene still didn't convince me to scream the negative in my mind. Even when it's shown that Shelton's past in black-ops helps explain his genius, all the while edging him more to the experienced \\"psychopath\\" status, it doesn't take away from the fact that Shelton's wife and daughter are no more innocent than the career-climbing, shallow prosecutor who took a plea bargain from a possible killer who could've easily been convicted in court. Nor should Shelton's wife and daughter's lives be pitted in the same category as their killers, Darby and Ames. While Shelton's methods are at times extreme, there is no measure or limit of pain for someone who has gone through such a loss. And anyone who's gone through such a loss feels he has nothing left to lose. This movie is a testament to that.<br /><br />Still, the main question here (as with all revenge pics) is: Does his unfair loss justify all the death that he's caused? Sadly, I don't think a movie can truly answer this moral ambiguity. I say this because, in a movie most times, we the audience see the truth of the matter that the characters in the film did/do not see. In \\"Citizen,\\" we see that Darby is the main killer of Shelton's family and therefore most of the audience have already agreed in their minds that he should be punished in some way and not given a plea bargain. But that is not what Rice knows in the film and so he makes the wrong decision which leaves a majority of the audience not liking his character; especially when we find out that he did it just so he could keep his 96% conviction rate to someday climb to gain D.A. status. The true test of morality in a film such as this comes when even the audience doesn't know whether the person under suspicion did the crime or not (case in point, Clint Eastwood's [[ASIN:B0029F21BA Mystic River [Blu-ray]]]). Only then are our morals truly tested.<br /><br />When we know who the real culprit is, most of the audiences' opinions are already formed, leaving the rest of the movie hoping for the \\"good guy\\" to prevail and the \\"bad guy(s)\\" to face justice. That's why I sometimes enjoy revenge films. They're not always about trying to leave an indelible impression on the audience so that they continue to discuss the film hours after its ending. Mostly, revenge films are just genre action flicks where the good guy and bad guy duke it out. And while \\"Citizen\\" desperately attempts to be a morality tale of turning the avenger into a psychopath, and thus making the audience question revenge and whether the world is truly black and white, it doesn't live up to those films which do convey this question/message: \\"Mystic River,\\" [[ASIN:B000F1IQN2 Munich (Widescreen Edition)]], and [[ASIN:B000L212HC The Prestige [Blu-ray]]]. This film did a great job at the art of revenge but its ending was something to be desired. I feel like the writer tried too hard to make it into something it wasn't: a thinking-man's revenge thriller. The vengeance that Shelton takes on each of his prey is methodical but also fitting to the responsibility he believes they had in his family's injustice.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed \\"Law Abiding Citizen.\\" While I loved the beginning and middle - and the pacing was excellent - the very ending was a little too morally self-righteous and unbelievable for me to swallow. Not only is it unbelievable about how Shelton continues his vengeance while still in prison, but what's most unbelievable is how Rice and Shelton come to a head at the end. Those last 15 minutes of the film while a little tense were, nevertheless, a bit droll but also mostly unfitting to a story that gave so much potential in its first 94 minutes. It seemed as if the writer planned on penning a great revenge thriller, but, at last minute, changed his mind and wanted to try to send some deep, affecting message. And while that works for films like \\"Mystic River\\" or \\"Munich\\" - movies where revenge (although prevalent) takes a backseat to morals and humanity - it just didn't for this film, where gore, violence, catchy one-liners and many different ways of killing someone was at the forefront.in point, Clint Eastwood's [[ASIN:B0029F21BA Mystic River [Blu-ray]]]).

0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a fantastically written and very intriguing book. Although it is slow starting, as soon as the action picks up, the reader is immediately drawn in. The writing style of the author is what made the book the best-seller that it is.   Orson Scott Card does not use flashy language in the novel, which is very appropriate due to the fact that it is about a child. He doesn't use elaborate descriptions of the settings where the book occurs which can be viewed in two ways. On one hand, this style leaves a lot of room for the reader's imagination to work; on the other hand, occasionally the book seems to be rather bland with no color whatsoever.    Another accomplishment of the writer in this book is he is able to bring the characters in to our hearts. He does this by focusing on a few main characters and really bringing them to life. Each character seems to have a role in the book that has been measured to continue to keep the plot moving along. For instance, Peter Wiggin appears in Ender's life during Ender's early childhood and during Ender's time at Battle School. However the manner in which he influences Ender changes although he still negatively affects him. While Ender is on Earth, Peter physically takes over Ender and makes Ender feel inferior to himself; once in space the physical abuse disappears and Ender is controlled mentally by Peter.   In addition, another fact that must not be overlooked is Card's ability to use children as his vector to carry the message of the book. Ender, Valentine and Peter Wiggin are beyond intelligent, ahead of the adults in the world, so much so that their influence is felt on a global scale. However, Orson Scott Card does not lose the reason young people are so captivated by the novel: the fact that the main characters are children. What I felt would happen as the book progressed was the Wiggins would become adults in child bodies. Throughout the story, as the Wiggins are placed in settings that would be more suited towards adults, they retain the innocence of children.   Ender's Game was a terrific read and I highly recommend it for everyone because it appeals to a large variety of readers.
1400052173|4.0|Right now I am 3/4 of the way through this book and can't put it down but I keep thinking that it probably would not have been written if the doctor who had worked with these cells had given them a different name besides \\"HeLa\\", the first two letters of the original donor's first and last names.  Like, what if he gave the cells a number with letters from HIS first and last names, or just some other random combination of letters and numbers, e.g. something involving the month, year and some random letters. BE THIS A LESSON TO RESEARCHERS -- if you are working with human cells and have to give them a name, DO NOT give one that in the LEAST resembles the name of the original donor.    The cells that this entire book is about were from a particularly agressive cervical cancer taken from a black woman named Henrietta Lacks, a cervical cancer probably caused by HPV virus (genital wart virus) given to her by her philandering husband, a husband who was a cousin that she married after he got her pregnant.  She then had several more children with him, one of whom she carried while she had the beginning stages of this cancer.  She died when this last child was a baby.  Her five children were basically orphaned because their father gave them to some other relatives to raise, or, more accurately, to neglect and abuse.  The book focuses on the life stories of these unfortunate children, their offspring, and other Lacks' relatives, both white and black.  The author spent a lot of her time and energy pursuing and the interviewing Henrietta's daughter Deborah, a woman prone to histrionics, whose understanding of modern science is quite insignificant.  She actually believed that the HeLa cancer cells could be used to make clones of her mother.      As I said, I am 3/4 of the way through and have found the descriptions of the contributions of HeLa cells to modern cytology and epidemiology fascinating -- they have been used to develop polio and HPV vaccines, among others.  I am gettingvery tired of all the Lacks' family drama, their insistence that their mother's cells were \\"stolen\\" and that because money has been made from them, they should be entitled to some of it.  OK, like many poor Americans, their lives were difficult and unfortunate and filled with tragedy and suffering, but other people like them have had similar lives and have chosen to rise above them.  Henrietta had a horrible death at a very young age, but as cancer treatment was in its infancy in those days, there was not that much that could be done with a disease such as hers for both rich and poor.  Her cells are being used to helped develop cures for diseases.  This is a legacy that she did not consciously choose, nor did any of her descendants help to promote.  Occasionally they seem to glimpse the importance of this, but not often.

155297944X|5.0|This picture book for young children deals with a unique subject matter, the aging of a mother who is loving and devoted.  The story  begins with a mother and her newborn infant and shares a refrain in which she sings \\"Love You Forever......etc....\\"  It moves through his various stages of life, including adulthood when he moves away.  At the end when she is elderly and ill, we see him rocking her in his arms the way she has done with him over the years and singing the love you forever refrain.  It helps  children to understand the importance of enduring love as well as the life cycle of a parent.
B000SINT52|4.0|I tried for a long time to avoid this documentary because I didn't need more evidence of Bush's mental infertility.  I don't care how he reacted to the 9/11 attack, after all, we all have our own predictable reactions! I do give a damn though about how we were played... again to make money for a few individuals!<br /><br />Now that Bush is finally out of the office; I watched this documentary as an act of personal grieving over our precipitous descent into a nightmare during the past few years. It is, also, my angry, heart felt response to those who either can't see or refuse to see this cruel game of deception and destruction.<br /><br />For the love of whatever you believe in... Ask yourself: why 140 Saudis were allowed to leave the country after 9/11? What is the connection between the Carlyle group and the Bush's family? What is the connection between Saudi oil money and the Bush's? What is that we allowed the Taliban Minister in 2001? Why our media didn't allow us to see our American soldiers die in Afghanistan and Iraq, while the whole world witnessed it?<br /><br />After all...Britney Spears and America trusted Bush; Please God... have mercy on us!

0375836675|5.0|I like to read but I am very critical of the books that I do read.  I have trouble finding the right book for me and therefore am disappointed in some of the books I have read over the years.  I was introduced to Markus Zusak by a friend who was reading The Book Thief.  I decided to give one of his books a try and since I heard so many good things about The Book Thief, I decided to try out \\"I am the Messenger\\" first. I was a little concerned because I found this book in the Young Adult section, but I thought I would still give it a try. I was hooked from the first chapter.  I could not put it down.  The connection I made with the characters were amazing.  The way the author describes the emotions going on in Ed Kennedy's mind give a deep appreciation for the different things that he goes through (I won't give to much detail because I don't want to spoil it).  I loved this book it was a great read for any age.  I read some reviews that said the ending was not up to what they thought it should be.  I disagree I loved the ending it tied the story together and gave, again, an appreciation for the situations presented to Ed Kennedy.  I give this book a wonderful recommendation for anyone who likes to laugh when reading but also be moved at the same time. For me this book gives new meaning to the word \\"GREAT BOOK\\"
B001OG3VOQ|5.0|I usually don't review the products I buy, and this is my first review on Amazon.  However, Jagged Little Pill by Alanis Morissette, just about defined my adolescence. I was a precocious 11 year old girl in 1995 when this album came out, and to this day I remember the first time I heard it in its entirety. My best friend had received it as a birthday present and she asked me if I wanted to hear something \\"cool\\" and played \\"You Oughta Know\\". I went out and bought my own copy that same day. Her honesty and angst were refreshing, and this album sort of became like a \\"big sister\\" to me in a time in my life when I, like so many other young girls, felt misunderstood and insecure. The impact this album had of me was huge, and it is the one album that I have bought repeatedly (4 times) due to wearing it out. (Thank God for my iPhone now!) On a broader scale, JLP played a pivitol role in opening up the doors for female artists, and it is one of the most important albums of that decade.  Need more proof? Ask anyone who was alive then, and they will remember this CD. There were 7 top ten singles, 5 of which went #1 on the charts. It is the 2nd best selling album of the 90's.  It remained #1 on Billboard's Top 200 for 12 weeks, and in the top 10 for over a year (it is 1 of only 3 albums to ever do this). It was nominated for 6 Grammy awards in 1996. Alanis was EVERYWHERE. Listening to this album takes me right back to the mid-to-late 90's. I remember what I was doing and going through at that time and how I felt. That, to me, is the mark of a masterpiece. It's hard for me to summarize how profound Jagged Little Pill is, and do it justice. It holds a very special place in my heart. Simply put, this album is nothing short of historical and has more than earned my highest reccomendation.  On a side note, if you enjoy this album at all, you really should check out \\"[[ASIN:6304524927 Jagged Little Pill Live]]\\", which is the official video of the JLP Tour.
B002WY65W4|5.0|Yes, I know it's campy and far from a family-safe movie... but it's one of the most entertaining Zombie flicks out there. It isn't meant to be dark and scary like most of them, but like Sean of the Dead is intended to make you laugh out loud and to think about loyalty, friendship during the inevitable apocalyptic decay of society.
0143038419|2.0|The title just about says it.  Not much going on here other than search for everything without meaning.

I did and didn't find anything worth the time.

0694003611|1.0|This book is not visually stimulating nor is there any real prose. VERRRRRY BORING and non sensical in a way that doesn't entertain like a Dr Seuss would. So disappointing after reading all the good reviews...if you really must throw away your money, send it my way.

Problem 2, The completely stupid \\"Ambush\\" scene in the desert. or Hey we're under fire, let's all stand up and fire our rifles from the hip, Just like John Wayne. I was in the Infantry, when you come under fire, you don't stand up, you do the opposite. What the heck were EOD guys doing out there in the first place? Did they go to sniper school as well?   Problem 3, There is this thing called a chain of command. Rogue types, don't last long, in the real chain of command.   There are many other other problems with this \\"realistic movie\\", but it is not worth discussing any further.  Conclusion.  Stupid hollywood attempt at war drama. Might help to get a technical advisor next time.   Watch \\"Black Hawk Down\\" instead.
B00006AVRK|5.0|If you're either an Anglophile or just an immense fan of the hilarious writings of P.G. Wodehouse (pronounced WOOD'-house), then you should hardly consider passing up this little-known but terrific British television series.<br /><br />For a long time I wondered how anyone could possibly produce the Jeeves and Wooster tales of Wodehouse (1881-1975) for film or television episodes and make them come off any way near like the great writer intended them. Incredibly, they've done it here! Much of the kudos must go directly to Stephen Fry (Inspector Thompson in [[ASIN:B00005JKNF Gosford Park]]) and Hugh Laurie ([[ASIN:B001QE99AQ House: Season One]].) It's almost as if the television series came out first and then Wodehouse expanded the books from the screenplay. These two brilliant characters are very, very good together. This is a British 1990-1993 television series which ended all too soon as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />So what's it all about? Well, I can give you the essential formula and assure you that each episode pretty much adapts to this theme (although somehow one never tires of it): Bertie Wooster, a youthful, energetic, and marriage eligible peer of the realm is endlessly the object of amorous (and usually harebrained) English maidens. Bertie himself has a penchant for generating convoluted imbroglios from these prospective affairs and he's always seeking a shrewd way out of his demise -- when he follows his own intuitions, or one put forth by one of his pals from The Drones' Club, the situation worsens every time. But Wooster's personal man, [Reginald] Jeeves, ultimately devises some intricate scheme which, while initially giving rise to chaos, always blossoms nicely in the end for the best of all parties concerned. Jeeves is clearly the most proper and efficient butler/valet/chauffer in England but he's perfectly willing to resort to the most dubious of improprieties and challenges to the local constabulary and/or the aristocracy in order to save the day for his erratic master and his eccentric pals.<br /><br />Some folks love the subtle, sharp-edged ambiance of British wit and it equally often drives non-fans crazy. Well this is right up there with [[ASIN:B00005O3VC Monty Python and the Holy Grail (Special Edition)]] for the former group. This stuff is roll-on-the-floor-and-hold-yer-belly fare for those of us who savour such antics as are perpetrated by Wodehouse characters such as Augustus \\"Gussie\\" Fink-Nottle (Richard Braine) and the Hitler-ish Roderick Spode (John Turner.)<br /><br />There are twenty-three color episodes in all and they run for 55 minutes each -- there's not a boring three-second span in any of them. They were directed by Ferdinand Fairfax (12 episodes), Simon Langton (6 episodes), and Robert Young. The series is a Granada production, an organization which always puts forth a first-class product. The locations, sets, and cinematography reflect quality of the First Water.<br /><br />Make no mistake about it, this British comedy blockbuster is a genuine treasure - highly recommended for those people I have targeted above. And if you are unfamiliar with the works of P.G. Wodehouse, I can also highly recommend [[ASIN:0307266613 The Best of Wodehouse: An Anthology]].ic master and his eccentric pals.

B001QOGYFO|4.0|This was an entertaining and suspenseful movie and we enjoyed it. But well before the ending we both figured out who was the missing villain and what was in the plane that was so valuable.   The setting of the South Pole for this action mystery made it worth watching just for the views and conditions.   If you are looking for the ultimate suspense thriller then you will be disappointed. If you want perfect acting then you will be disappointed. If you nitpick over details or accuracy, then skip this movie.   But if you want a somewhat suspense thriller set in a very unique location then you might enjoy this movie.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|I have nothing but bright things to say about this 1975 film so where do I begin -- perhaps with the story itself?<br /><br />THE STORY: [18th Century] Redmond Barry (later, Barry Lyndon played by Ryan O'Neal) starts out as a naive young Irishman with a penchant for both romance and adventure. After being initially defeated in his love for a stunningly beautiful girl, (ultimately through deception by a stogy old English military officer), Barry commences his life sojourn of Europe. He soon finds himself on the continent and right at the heart of period wars. He subsequently links up with an old card sharp who helps to expand his fortunes but Barry wants more... he longs for peerage and the only way he can get it is to cuckold an ailing old nobleman who is married to a beautiful young woman. He thus lets himself in for a financial and an amorous roller-coaster ride. Barry is a sympathetic character from start to finish, albeit he can be a bit of a scoundrel at times.<br /><br />This artful and darkly humorous film reeks of quality. The locations, the sets, the props, the filmscore, the camera-work... every consideration is of the First Water. Of course such features epitomize what we have come to expect from renowned director Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />Prior to viewing this film I was not a previously great fan of Ryan O'Neal ([[ASIN:B001O4KBNC Peyton Place: Part One]]) - but his performance in this film turned me around on both his remarkable skill as an actor as well as his clear adaptability. I was also very pleased to see one of my personal favorite actors, Patrick Magee, ([[ASIN:B000286S38 Dementia 13]] ) in his flawlessly cast role as \\"The Chevalier.\\" But the hallmark jewel in the crown was another tremendous actor of all too little fame, Frank Middlemass ([[ASIN:B000QGE86K War & Peace (1972)]]), who played Sir Charles Lyndon - he was perfect!<br /><br />This 2003 DVD runs for a total of 184 minutes (never boring!) and it is presented in a \\"matted widescreen\\" format, (which is a sort of \\"expanded letterbox\\" aspect and which looks great on a widescreen television.) The film is rated PG. It's all just spectacular and it has easily earned my highest rating of five stars.<br /><br />If you liked this film you will surely also enjoy a more contemporary entry which employs the same sorts of themes: [[ASIN:B001L57ZZG The Duchess]].anded letterbox\\" aspect and which looks great on a widescreen television.)

1842171593|4.0|This is a very thorough, if somewhat technical account, of Roman military weapons and equipment.  The illustrations are clear and detailed.  The research it took to produce the information contained in the book must have been exhaustive.  I am an amateur and a novice on the subject of Roman martial equipment, but by comparison with the other books I have read on the subject, ROMAN MILITARY EQUIPMENT is the most comprehensive.  My only criticism is that I wish the book was a little more user friendly.  It is not by any means inaccessible to the layman, however, and any student or enthusiast of Ancient Rome and its military might will find a wealth of useful information here about the equipment used by the legionnaires from the time of the Punic Wars (264 to 146 BC) to the fall of Rome.  I recommend ROMAN MILITARY EQUIPMENT to all modern day legionnaires and miles gloriosus wannabes.
B000002GWN|5.0|I bought this on vinyl about 18 months ago.. have since purchased the CD.    As a Jazz/Rock/Fusion guitarist, I must say I'm totally obsessed with Robben Ford's work on this album. Especially the rhythm guitar on tracks like 'The Last Time I Saw Richard', 'Carey' and 'You Turn Me On, I'm A Radio'     Tom Scott & The LA Express. Brilliant band!.. Am trying to track down a cheap copy of their first album, but seems to be quite collectable and therefore unobtainable.    I find it hard to believe some people are not happy with this band's take on Joni's wonderful and deeply affecting songs. This version of 'Big Yellow Taxi' for instance isn't so different from versions of Joni performing it solo at the time, similar tempo and upbeat rock. They just added rhythm section and a sax solo! If you want to hear a great and empathetic rhythm section, this is it.     This album confirms Joni Mitchell's genius, artistic decisions and sensibility.. and even amusing.

0679759328|5.0|Edith Hope is a moderately successful English author of romance novels.  But how does she handle love and marriage in her own life?  About 39, she has never married, although for years she has been having a discreet affair with a married man.  Finally she gives in to social pressures and accepts a proposal, but at the very last second she leaves the groom-to-be standing at the altar (actually, on the steps of the Registry Office).  To give the dust a chance to settle after that social faux pas, she secludes herself at the Hotel du Lac on Lake Geneva.  There she encounters a few other women guests, also bereft of men for one reason or another, and she has occasion to reflect on what sort of woman she is and wants to be.  She also meets a man who leads her to re-evaluate her views about the role of love in marriage.<br /><br />This is a bittersweet, world-weary contemporary romance.  It is, in the end, rather bleak and depressing.  The novel reminds me of the fiction of Henry James (in atmosphere and the attention to manners) and of \\"Excellent Women\\" by Barbara Pym.  Indeed, there are at least two references to \\"excellent women\\" in HOTEL DU LAC, and Edith Hope might well be Mildred Lathbury a generation later.  With regard to the slights and disappointments of life, both women had \\"learned to shield them, to hide them from sight, to keep them at bay.\\"  For Edith, like Mildred, \\"to exhibit my wounds would * * * denote an emotional incontinence of which I might later be ashamed.\\"  Very British . . . and touching.<br /><br />The strength of the novel is the graceful and refined prose and the admirably controlled and confident narrative technique.  Flashbacks are seamlessly interwoven into the tale and shifts in perspective are deftly managed.  It is a true pleasure to read.  Still, I am mildly surprised that it garnered the Booker Prize for Anita Brookner (in 1986), because it is not flashy, modern, or envelope-pushing.
B0015ABRE2|2.0|I just watched the first three seasons back to back over the course of about a week and a half. I was a little skeptical about the hype, but was quickly drawn into the first season. Season two was great up until the last couple episodes. Season three is pure crap, from start to finish.    The powers that be have taken what was a well written and well acted show and transformed it into a second rate soap opera. I can almost hear the director yelling, \\"Anguish, I need more anguish!!\\" at the actors as they go to a close up of agony on the face of whatever actor is grossly overacting the cheesy and predictable drama that is unfolding in any given scene on any given episode of season 3.     If you want a well written, well acted, well directed drama, buy The Wire. Season 3 of Dexter is a waste.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|\\"North by Northwest\\"(1959) is one of the greatest chase pictures care of Alfred Hitchcock. This comedy/thriller rolls right along for its duration as Cary Grant's character is constantly on the run for his life. This blu-ray is beautifully remastered in 1080p with an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 in Dolby TrueHD 5.1. This blu-ray book set includes a new 2009 Documentary about Alfred Hitchcock (\\"Hitchcock's Signature Style\\"), a feature length profile about Cary Grant (\\"A Class Apart\\"), an in depth exploration of \\"North by Northwest\\"(\\"One for the Ages\\"), a 2000 documentary (\\"Destination Hitchcock:The Making of North by Northwest\\"), gallery stills, a  music-only audio track, as well as printed material about Cary Grant,  James Mason, Eva Marie Saint, screenwriter Ernest Lehman, Alfred Hitchcock, and an essay entitled the \\"Ultimate Wrongman\\", along with countless photos of posters, sets pieces, the actors between scenes, et cetera. This is a nice overall package of a great movie.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A friend of mine recommended Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn a few years back, but for whatever reason, I did not add it to my reading list until after Sanderson had been selected to complete Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time. I consider myself a fan of fantasy, but I am often extremely skeptical of the epic fantasy sub-genre because a significant percentage of it tends to be derivative (see: Brooks, Terry; Eddings, David; Goodkind, Terry). The gold standard for me would be either George R.R. Martin or Robert Jordan, as the two moved epic fantasy out of the zone of hackneyed Tolkien rip-offs and into territory that was original and far more interesting.<br /><br />So hearing that Harriet McDougal, Jordan's widow, had personally selected Sanderson based on both his heartfelt online eulogy to Jordan and the quality of Mistborn, I knew he was someone I definitely had to take a look at. And I'm very glad that I did.<br /><br />If Martin and Jordan are the heavyweights of their generation of epic fantasy authors, then Brandon Sanderson is one of the leading authors of his own generation. Mistborn offers up a wholly original setting based on the question: \\"What would happen if the Dark One won?\\" And while it does adhere to the traditional Joseph Campbell model of heroic fiction, it does set it in an unusual world where ash falls from the sky and strange mists and creatures fill the night.<br /><br />At its heart, Mistborn is a heist novel, where a crack team of thieves bands together to attempt the impossible -- the destruction of the Lord Ruler and his Final Empire. And as trite as that may sound, the characters are so well-painted and compelling that they really are a cut above the traditional rogue stereotype found in epic fantasy, particularly works derived from Dungeons and Dragons.<br /><br />Central among the rebels is Vin, a young girl who has discovered that she is actually a Mistborn, or Sanderson's version of a mage and Kelsier, an older Mistborn and the charismatic leader of the rebels. Again, two mage/rogues would seem cliched, if Sanderson's magic system and physics weren't both so well-constructed and believable. Magic in Mistborn follows a strict set of rules and is never used in a way that isn't completely believable. Often it can be employed as deus ex machina, but in Sanderson's novels it has its limitations.<br /><br />I don't want to say much else about the book so as not to spoil it -- but it is quite remarkable. There are great set-ups and pay-offs, and some of the climactic battle scenes are exhilarating to read.<br /><br />The only downside for me is that I have four other books waiting to be read on my Kindle before I can get to the next volume in the trilogy. I tend to be a cynic when it comes to the genre, but I haven't been this excited upon completion of a fantasy novel since I finished A Storm of Swords all those years ago.mage/rogues would seem cliched, if Sanderson's magic system and physics weren't both so well-constructed and believable.

031606792X|3.0|Okay I admit I read most of these reviews before I even cracked the cover of this book. BIG mistake! Beware of the negative reviews it will leave a bad image in your head and sour taste in your mouth. I went into this book thinking I was going to hate it based on others thoughts, but honestly it wasn't nearly as bad as they voiced. Yes, the story could have been juicier but it did finish the story of Bella and Edward and the others. Yes the LONG over due love scenes between Bella and Edward could have been better, but honestly this isn't a Linda Howard novel and keep in mind it is written for the teen age group. It is what it is and we got the point! I've read many reviews stating Bella's pregnancy was exteremly short and how realistic that is...um you are reading a book about a human who was knocked up by a Vampire! How realistic is that? Again read the book for yourself make your own judgement and if you've read the first three what is one more?
B001W63DY6|5.0|This is by far her best recorded concert thus far because you get to see and hear that young unguarded singer come out of Barbra at last. The set now that took some planning and the lighting, sound all were top notch here. The song list the best so far and the song arrangements brought new freshness to each song. Barbra at last on film is actually having fun performing live as a singer.  A very long road for her but I believe it took her other concerts live to get her to this point in her singing career...she grew as an artist...a singer in a live format. She did it and after watching this concert I can see bits of that same singer as I did in \\"My Name Is Barbra\\".  Streisand has come full circle for the music fans we are lucky she has returned to her music and continues to perform live. Next up that New York concert she did in the fall of 2009 again the singer is still branching out her musical roots. Barbra you now sing with soul, girl you can swing with the band oh yeah for that reason alone I got to see you once more I hope You and Diana Krall do a few dates together that would be a nice treat for all us Streisand fans (and Diana Krall fans too). Thanks for the music and sharing your gift live/concert. Luv ya, Dann 2/19/2010.  P.S. Columbia Records I hope you are still supporting this singer 100% one of your  artist that is a true performer both on record and in live concerts $$$ $$$$.
B000ZELISO|3.0|Enough has been said about Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince movie.  In my opinion it is not one of my favorites because it doesn't really follow the book.      The Blu-Ray version is hard to use.  Its my first Blu-ray disc and the menus were difficult to follow and hard to see the choices on the screen.
0756405890|4.0|I really enjoyed this story. It's written well and it's fun. There is a well thought-out world here and most fantasy elements such as magic and dragons are handled in a mature, almost believable fasion. I've read a lot of sci-fi/fantasy over the years and I say \\"The Name of the Wind\\" is a damn good tale and I'm looking forward to the follow-up.    One gripe though, hence the missing star. The hero is just a bit too good at everything for my taste. He's a doctor, a magician, an architect, an alchemist, a musician, the valedictorian, the greatest wizard ever, the man, the legend, ugghh...Patrick Rothfuss obviously sees himself in his hero. I had it from his own lips via an online interview. It's more than a little self indulgent and it's simply irritating. It detracts from the overall body of work and anyone living in a 4-d world will know what I mean. Maybe Rothfuss is compensating...I dunno.     But for me it was the one fault in an otherwise really, really good novel. A gem I say. Not to be missed.

His energy, talent and demand for the very best was at the top. He expected a great deal from both himself and the production. I can't imagine anyone to feel bad or think that this dvd hit the market for the jackpot of sales it will create without realizing the costs that had already incurred for a proformance never seen by sold out audiences who never witnessed the greatness Michael, once again, intended to create. Shame on anyone who would bad talk such incredible determination and dedication. Bless you Michael, for my wish for you is that you are now at peace.
B002ZBT84G|5.0|Honestly, I never thought Gil Scott-Heron would ever return to recording. This new album, although short, is absolutely fantastic. It posesses a haunting beauty that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until you feel every nuance, every ounce of lived life in the ragged, torn voice. The poems and lyrics dig deep into places you did not think you'd ever go. I sincerely hope this is not a one-off, and that this great return will inspire more recordings from Scott-Heron. He certainly deserves to be revered as the major artist he still is.
0743277708|4.0|Going into this book, all I knew was that it was a classic that was about talking bunnies. Now, I've never been a big fan of rabbits, but I decided to give this a try anyway. I mean a five hundred page book about rabbits? I had to see what this was all about.<br /><br />After the initial charm wore off, I was bored. I found all the rabbits to be interchangeable, and some of their folklore confusing. But, it got better as it went on, especially those final 200 hundred pages. I found some of their chapter-long fables distracting, as well as a sudden switch to the human world. There would be random comments about baseball or something to describe a situation, and it would draw me out of the story. I also didn't like the portrayal of does as just sex-objects, which would make me have less sympathy for the rabbits plight. I have to say, for the most part, I forgot they were bunnies. The writing was easily read, and it wasn't to hard to follow. If I was a tad smarter, I could figure out all the parallels between bunny warrens and human government, but I'm too lazy for that.<br /><br />Even though it is usually marketed as a young adult book, I think anyone can enjoy it. Overall, it was a enjoyable fantasy and quite epic.
0399226907|5.0|It is hard to know what to say that hasn't been said before about a classic like this.  Beautiful illustrations in a fun layout that still entertains adults while making little ones want to turn each page to see what that caterpillar might have eaten next -- and all the while they are learning how to count!  Brilliant!!  This is a gift choice that I always return to when one of my friend's babies becomes a toddler!  I'd recommend this as a gift for children age 2 through 4 (but it is a classic, so you may want to get it earlier or check with the mom or dad to see if they already have it!)

0316044938|5.0|Alice Seybold's The Lovely Bones is a novel you should make a point to read. Seybold illustrates the many feelings that accompany the loss of a child, the loss of a sibling, and the loss of life. Seybold's readers will truly connect with the Salmon family; more then they have in any novels they have read previously. Alice Seybold writes in a way that incorporates her reader into story, as if they were a part of Susie's community and have lost a friend.  This is one of those few stories that make the reader ponder on what direction they are taking in their own life and it shows them the preciousness of life.   Alice Seybold was born in Madison, Wisconsin, however she grew up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. It is said that Seybold was raped when she was younger, thus causing a few of her stories to portray characters who have been raped. She now lives in California with her husband, who is also a writer.   Each and every reader should feel a connection to this story and this book's characters, if they don't they must have skimmed or was not intellectually mature enough to handle the dynamic characters and well-thought-out plot line perhaps.   Seybold does an amazing job in creating a story that has not been told before; it is fresh, and new. Although like life it has some dull, lifeless moments. Many may find this to be a downfall and decrease the quality of the story being told, however, I find this to be a plus. These dull moments showcase the mundane-ness in the Salmon family's life after Susie's death, not everything in life is bubbling with excitement. These seemingly colorless patches of The Lovely Bones, makes the suspenseful or exciting moments, magnified. This is a truly one-of-a-kind story that will always, no matter how many times it may be read, it will always capture the hearts of its readers.

B002WY65VU|5.0|\\"Zombieland\\" is a good Ol' popcorn muchin', summertime style zombie killin', action flick, that is actually smartly written and deftly directed. The best comparison I can make is that it's a cinematic cross breeding of the apocalyptic, zombie disease destroyed, civilization of \\"28 Days Later\\" with the zombie belly laughs of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\".<br /><br />In the film, human civilization has apparently munched on one too many E.coli filled cheeseburgers, which has made \\"the leap from mad-cow to mad-human to mad-zombie.\\" The film is narrated by Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) a brainy, nebbish-like wimp, who is forever going over his list of rules (which are inventively displayed on screen), that have so far kept him alive in what he has dubbed \\"Zombieland\\". He is joined by Tallahasse (Woody Harrelson) a violent, psychotic redneck, who's two joys in life are killing zombies and finding the last remnents of Hostess Twinkies, left in the USA. These two characters are polar opposites, but their humorously testy, at odds, relationship seems to work. Eventually they meet up with two young, con-artist sisters, Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), who are on their way to a supposably \\"zombie-free\\", L.A. amusment park for a little fun. Together, these four eclectic characters embark on a violent, but very funny, zombie killing road trip, cross-country to the West Coast.<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" is hardly a horror film. I really wouldn't call it scary at all. Instead it is more of a comedy, set up with some very well-directed, violent, action sequences. But what really sets this movie apart from other zombie films is the literate, well written script (by Rhett Reese & Paul Wernick) that actually seems to care about its characters and give them a little dimension all while offering up some very funny, pointed, dialogue that satirizes everything from American obesity to our obsession with movies and Hollywood celebrity. Plus, how many zombie movies have you seen that references both Gandhi and Hannah Montana?<br /><br />The young cast is very good, but the stand out performance goes to Woody Harrelson. He's really amazing playing a psychotic redneck with heart (and a whole lot of weapons). Finally, there is a surprise, extended celebrity cameo, that will have you rolling on the floor with laughter. (O.K., one hint...he's a comedy legend).<br /><br />\\"Zombieland\\" is an excellent, action packed movie with lots of blood, bodies and laughs. Give it a try!h Gandhi and Hannah Montana?

B001UV4XX8|3.0|Instead turned out to be a frustrating mess. I love the original story but I understood going in there would have to be some serious time extensions, I just did not know it would be so X-Files. Chris Carter created one of my favorite themes to watch with the whole conspiracy arc, and even though Kelly tried to create his own twist on this arc, I felt more frustration than reward by the end.<br /><br />Plot descriptions for a film like this can actually do a disservice, but the BD has so many issues it is difficult to not cover some major aspects of the story. The effects are given their own three part supplement, but their quality was not intended for Blu. That overall soft look (white glow throughout) detracted from there being any good line definition and there are only a few scenes of color in the entire film. The facial disfigurement of Langella's character is pixelated in half of the scenes, while the city scapes ended up looking like those race car model tracks from the 70s. Those water tower effects looked hokey, but the following scene of the water delivery in the bed sounded good. Which leads into the sound aspects. The DTS gave some nice references (the rocket test, the ever-imposing score) but the mix made Langella's voice muddled/having bad echoes in every wind-tunnel scene. The supplements include one must see:<br /><br />* Richard Matheson, In His Own Words, 6 minutes. Better than the entire film and other supplements - he truly demonstrates a writer's humility and grace, a great interview.<br />* Visual FX revealed, all three sets were \\"triumphs\\" for this company, but I thought they all looked poor to average, especially the city sets/mattes.<br />* Music Video Prequels. Wow, cannot stress enough what a complete waste of time these were. Clips from the movie to the score and they are called prequels?.<br />* The Box, less then 15 minutes. Gave some interesting insight and a few touching moments about how Kelly's personal life and family are the inspirations behind this film. Worth the watch for fans of his.<br />* Commentary by Kelly.<br /><br />Admittedly, I almost want to give this a higher rating because I love the greater-than-humanity conspiracy arc, but it felt so misplaced, disorganized and unexplained here that it detracts from being a great film. That and the effects were so distracting and the writing/editing poor (they forgot to add snow in the last scenes so it magically became fall from there being a thick snow layer that evening), coupled with a few forgettable supplements and an average BD, I had to go with three stars only.<br /><br />No region coding listed, English. Spanish and French languages with subs in same. I almost wanted to watch it in a dubbed language with Cameron's accent changing/disappearing so many times in the film, it was a relief when she spoke normally.th the watch for fans of his.  * Commentary by Kelly.

B002RV01Q8|5.0|These are four editions of music and videos with the very best collections of music from Enya. It is excellent that finally we can have videos of Enya, as \\"[[ASIN:B00005NGU5 Enya-The Video Collection]]\\" in 2001 was nearly impossible to obtain, except some rare copies of region 2 that were available here in Amazon.<br /><br />I love the music of Enya, and I know that each of the songs in these collections are very valuable. Unfortunately, if you want to have all the songs, you should buy all four editions: [[ASIN:B002RV01Q8 The Very Best Of Enya (CD/DVD)]], [[ASIN:B002X3V4P2 The Very Best Of Enya (Deluxe - Amazon Exclusive)]],[[ASIN:B002RV01QI The Very Best Of Enya CD]] and [[ASIN:B002TKTOQA The Very Best Of Enya (CD/DVD plus 12 inch vinyl picture disc)]] because each of these editions has songs you can not find in the other editions.<br /><br />So, I'm posting a table of each song and its counterpart in each of the editions. You notice that there are songs you can find in any of the editions such as: \\"Amarantine\\", \\"Anywhere Is\\", \\"Caribbean Blue\\", \\"Only Time\\", \\"Orinoco Flow\\", \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\" and \\"Wild Child\\". This is very valuable because in the CD/DVD edition, in addition to the track, you can enjoy the videos as well. This is really fascinating!<br /><br />You'll also find that some songs are only in one of the three editions, for example, \\"Evening Falls\\" you can only watch the video in the CD/DVD edition; \\"Water shows the hidden heart\\" that you find only in the CD edition, and \\"Only Time (Remix)\\" only available in the exclusive MP3 Deluxe edition from Amazon.  Furthermore, there are other exclusive tracks in the [[ASIN:B002TKTOQA vinyl]]  edition.<br /><br />So, if you're a true fan of Enya, I think you should buy all editions, however, I think the most valuable is the edition CD/DVD by the rarity of the videos, and the [[ASIN:B002TKTOQA vinyl]] edition for collectors.<br /><br />The table is a little bit messy, but I hope this helps you choose the perfect edition.<br /><br />------------------SONG------------CD/DVD-----MP3DELUXE-----CDONLY-----<br />Amarantine______________________[I]/[I]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Anywhere Is_____________________[I]/[I]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Caribbean Blue___________________[I]/[I]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Only Time_______________________[I]/[I]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Orinoco Flow__________________ __[I]/[I]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Trains And Winter Rains_________ __[I]/[I]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Wild Child___________________ _ __[I]/[I]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Aniron__________________________[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Boadicea___________________ ____[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />May It Be_______________________[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Watermark______________________[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[I]_______<br />Athair Ar Neamh_______ __________[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[ ]_______<br />Drifting_________________________[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[ ]_______<br />Fallen Embers_________________ __[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[ ]_______<br />Flora's Secret_________________ __[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[ ]_______<br />If I Could Be Where You Are_____ __[I]/[ ]_________[I]__________[ ]_______<br />My!

0385504225|5.0|This book is a thrill ride into the language of symbols and secret societies. I am no expert on either, but the fantasy is so much fun. Often when I read a book by Brown I am eager to do research in order to find out if there is any truth to his fiction. This book is no exception to that eagerness born within me. His topics make me curious, and I love that about his books.     When I say I could not put this book down, I mean it. I would find myself waking at two in the morning just to read a little bit more. Silly, I know, but his books affect me the same way any other craving does: I've got to have just a little bit more.     Robert Langdon is the modern day Indiana Jones. I love the adventures he finds himself pulled into. I've read \\"Angels and Demons,\\" and \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" and this book reminds me a lot of the previous two. Simply put I am a fan of Brown and of his character Robert Langdon, who I have a crush on:-).
B001TODCII|5.0|1st of all i love this movie. It was so great how Liam Neeson played his character. Some people might not like this movie but i did. I thought that any man that would go through all that just to save his daughter is the best dad ever. He was smart and he knew his way around a gun like no other. This movie touched me right to my core because i know about human trafficking. (I don't do business in it). But i have researched it and i feel bad for the hundreds of young people who get themselves wrapped up in it.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|We got this for an amazingly low price--a low price to pay to have your favorite Gilmore Girls episode on hand when you're in the mood to watch it. The packaging is cute, and there's a nice booklet with summaries of all the episodes. The extra DVD features aren't that great, but the shows themselves are fantastic.
1439153663|5.0|I choose this book as it was a new release for the Kindle.  The review sounded good and I always like to give debut authors a try. Loving my new Kindle and this book made it easy to read. I simply could not put it down. I was so deeply drawn to the characters that I felt myself feeling so much emotion. You can't help but feel happiness, sadness, revenge and yes cry with some of the characters. It really shows the amount of extensive reseach Ms.Grissom has done and transposed it into a beautiful story. Give yourself a treat and welcome Ms.Grissom by reading this delight. Can't wait to see what she brings us next.

B002SJIO4A|1.0|I was so excited to get this DVD and watch it but it disappointed me. The first 30-40 minutes of the movie is just confusing and does not make sense much. The rest of the movie is violent, inhumane and full of gory scenes. It did not have an iota of message about humanity or did I miss something? Any how, I did not get the story line and do not recommend this movie. It's overrated.
044024238X|5.0|I loved it! This is the first book I've ever read by Sophie Kinsella and I am definitely a fan. This book is so fun and I laughed and smiled quite a bit while reading. It really can lift your spirits. The characters are all charming (in their own way) and I just loved them all. Would absolutely recommend!
B0012EST60|4.0|There appears to be many versions available for the Kindle.  I can only comment on this version that I have read on my DX.  The translation appears to be excellent and in the true spirit of the lyrical style of the novel.  However, I noticed a few minor issues.  First, there were a number of instances where the translator used the incorrect word (e.g. woman vs. women and want vs. went), but it did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel.  Second, the other problem I noticed was with formatting.  It did not appear to be optimally formatted for viewing on the screen.  I had to adjust the text and I could not eliminate gaps in many sentences.  There are no links to the various chapters.  Overall, this is a great book to own for your Kindle at a great price!
0446579939|4.0|When I first started reading this book, it didn't feel like a Nicholas Sparks book. It was kind of weird and I had to keep re-reading sentences because it seemed really slow and I kept daydreaming (not a good start). However, the story finally started to unravel and it got better. I really despised the ex in this book and I guess I personally didn't like how it made me feel. When I read Nicholas Sparks books, I hope to not be so annoyed by any of the main characters because his books are my way of drifting away from reality. But other than that, I'd recommend getting the book from the library. Not something I'd read again, but I still give it 4 stars.
0061876747|3.0|3.5 stars.  Not Boyd's best but even a novel of his below par is a good read.  I won't review the details of the novel--the L.A. Times has an accurate assessment and provides the story line.  There were sections that I really loved--being under the radar, hiding out in The Triangle by the Thames, encounters with some very bad people, how immigrants speak English.  But about halfway through I began skimming, a sure sign that something is amiss for me.  I wanted to know what happened, but it was becoming a tedious read too often.  Books by Boyd that I loved are Brazzaville Beach, Any Human Heart and Restless--my 3 favorites of his.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|What's creepier than unseen things that go bump in the night?  I live on the intersection of Nowhere and Too Late, quite a ways from the next neighbor.  One calm, windless night, while working in our big garage around 3 a.m., I listened with a certain hair-raising thrill as the east sliding bay door made a repeated rapping sound.  No wind, mind you, not a blade of grass stirring and the right bay door perfectly still and silent.  I looked around and saw nothing.    Beats me what it was.  Maybe a big spectral rat was digging under the sill plate.  \\"Paranormal Activity\\" was this kind of movie, where you don't see the beastie, only its effects.  The show was somewhat spooky, but truth be told, the \\"Blair Witch Project\\" stole its thunder.  You knew this wasn't real, and there's something about \\"Activity's\\" setting in a modern, spacious house that just wasn't as chilling as being lost in the dark woods with some kind of supernatural critter on the loose.    Another truer note from \\"Blair Witch\\" was that the kids were trying to get away.  The young couple in \\"Activity\\", however, particularly the moron boyfriend, insisted on staying in the house until the end.  Sure, they were told that the demon would follow them.  But I'd have burned rubber getting out of the house anyway, if only to shake the demon for a day or two.    On the other hand, although the boyfriend was pigheaded about staying, turning down help, and ultimately leading them to disaster, he did stick around when it was clear that the demon was only interested in his girlfriend.  How many guys would care enough about their girlfriends to tell Beelzebub to take a hike?    The movie worked fairly well, then, but not extraordinarily so.  The girl's being dragged out of bed by an invisible force was effectively scary, but both endings to the show were out of sync with the approach of the whole show previously.  Especially the main ending, which made a sort of manifestation of the demon in an unlikely way.    What sticks with me is how eerily similar the noise the demon made when it was haunting the couple's bedroom to the sound long freight trains sometimes make out here, some five miles away, on a quiet summer's night.  The same throbbing and muted rumbling you can hear through the walls.  Time to exorcise some trains?

1608201236|5.0|Maybe Lanyon could write another non-fiction book on \\"how to wrap up a successful series\\", because this is how it should be done. Nicely wrapped up, but still leaving readers wanting for more, leaving on a high note. The relationship story arc of the series has always been the centre point and fans won't be disappointed with this final book - lots of relationship/romance in it, but as always, Lanyon wovens the mystery plot smartly into it, the relationship and the mystery plot develop hand in hand. As Adrien said, \\"is solving crime together enough for a relationship?\\" Well... they would need more than that, but it's certainly great joy to see them solving the mystery together, while sorting out their complicated, heartwrenching romance.    Most of the Adrien English mysteries can be read as a stand alone book, however, this is probably one that I'd strongly suggest readers to go back to previous book(s) first - because it's simply not the same thing if readers don't know these two characters. In fact, it wouldn't be fair to judge this book without considering the previous books.    Be warned, it's an angsty ride - but so worth it.
B000000OF6|5.0|The perfect Queen set for the begginner.  you don't need hits 3...The first 2 is all you need.....If you love this package then the real fun begins....Start exploring the studio albums, like \\"A night at the opera\\"  \\"sheer heart attack\\" for the classic rock side of things, and \\"the Game' for the pop side of the band.  If all goes well with those than pick up the fan favorite \\"Queen2.\\" for the begginners.....I hope you have as much fun exploring this great band than I had years ago.

B001QOGYBI|4.0|\\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is a fun movie. Its stop-motion animation is surprisingly beautiful, and the design of the settings and characters combined with the effect creates a movie that is a visual pleasure to watch. It tells the story of the Fox family, whose patriarch, the titular Mr. Fox, incurs the wrath of three neighboring farmers who engage the family in an all-out war.    An all-star cast lend their voices to these characters, including George Clooney as Mr. Fox, Meryl Streep as his wife, and Bill Murray as their badger friend, Badger. The actors give a quirky charm to the characters, and make them endearing and entertaining to watch as they fend off the warring farmers. The action is set to an excellent score by Alexandre Desplat, and has a strong spaghetti Western influence.     The screenplay is lacking at times. Writer/director Wes Anderson is a darling of \\"indie\\" culture, and his style is a little forced in this film; some of the lines come off as overly self-conscious and forcedly quirky, but overall this does not diminish the zany charm and fun of the movie. If nothing else, it's worth a watch to see its gorgeous animation, and it's certain to leave a smile on your face.
0140157352|5.0|The book of the week was Getting to Yes by Roger Fisher and William Ury. This is a book all about negotiating, one of the most important skills any person can learn in a lifetime. You might think that negotiating is only for lawyers and business people, but everyone negotiates- every single day.<br /><br />People negotiate about simple things on a daily basis. You negotiate who pays for lunch, what movie to get at Blockbuster, what route to take on a family trip and the list goes on. Then there are some more obvious functions of negotiations: asking for a raise, bargaining with a shopkeeper in Central America (one of my favorite things to do), and trying to get the best deal on your new house. After reading this book, I look forward to all of these events to test my new found ability.<br /><br />When people think about negotiating, many have a lot of misconceptions of the \\"right\\" way to do it. Often negotiating is shown on television using the positional bargaining technique. Using this method people take sides. \\"This is what I want and I am sticking to it\\" and when you have two or more people arguing like this they become more and more entrenched into their own idea. Often, sides start to attack the other person's ideas and, in a round-about-way, start to attack that person. Big picture, positional bargaining leads to negotiation-by-strong-arm, if any solution is found at all, and really has negative affects on the relationships negotiating.<br /><br />The authors have a more useful approach to negotiating... Principled Negotiation. In essence, this is separating the people from the problem and focusing objectively on this issue. This does not mean that you do not focus on the people as a part of the issue, but just eliminate the \\"my side, your side\\" back and forth. In every negotiation there are people and those people have emotions and wants. You can and should take that into consideration when using principled negotiation. Ultimately it should all come down to fairness. You don't need to strong-arm someone into getting want you want. Just think about the situation as a whole and make agreements based off all the information. If someone wants to sell their house, they will have set a price on it. As the buyer, use all the information to negotiate a fair price for yourself and them. Use probing questions to get them to help you make a fair decision. Ask them how they came to their conclusion on the price... if they say that the house next door sold for that much... you might bring to their attention that the house two doors down sold for $20k less... or that the house they are basing their price off had 1 more bedroom and 1 more bathroom. In that case, how much is an extra bedroom worth?... They might say $8k... and a bathroom?... $4k... That other house also had a shed in the backyard when it sold, how much would that have been worth?.. $1500.. So on a so forth... using this type of negotiation you can objectively analyze the situation. Be sure all along the way to inform the negotiated party that you just want it all to be fair. Most people are on board when it comes to being fair.<br /><br />It is important you put yourself in the other party's shoes. See the situation the way they do. In the previous example they party wanted to sell their house. Find out why they want to sell their house, are they moving far away? How soon do they need the house sold? How long did they live there? In addition to helping you see the negotiation from their point of view it can give you incite into what agreement inventions to make to negotiate more efficiently. If you know they need to move within 2 weeks, you can invent a solution that involves closing sooner in exchange for a slightly higher price.... or if the party is on the fence about your asking price, closing within 2 weeks is something that can put them over the fence.... creating a win-win situation.<br /><br />Additionally, you will most likely come across aggressive negotiators that will give you high or low-ball offers, they may have someone else there playing good cop, bad cop or in the worst case, uses threats to try and get their way. When you find yourself in these situations, lay them out immediately and let the other party know that \\"I am most interested in the fairness of the deal and I know that your offer is just trying to high-ball me. Let's get past that, please give me a reasonable offer and we will work from there.\\"  You may find yourself in situations where a party manipulates the environment in order to make you uncomfortable: increasing the heat, being in a loud environment, being in a place where they know everyone and you know no one. If you find yourself in this situation let them know that you don't feel comfortable discussing the issues in that environment and you would like to reschedule to meet at X. Dirty negotiation techniques are used and the best thing you can do is let the other party know that you realize what is happening and bring them back to the issue of fairness.<br /><br />Next time you find yourself in the Caribbean negotiating the price of a hammock to take back to the States, use principled negotiation. Look at the situation from the shopkeepers perspective. Don't strong-arm him and play the whole game where you walk away 5 times in order to get the best deal. This will end up hurting the shopkeepers ego because he \\"gave in\\" to your demands and you probably won't get as good of deal and you might think. Instead, brainstorm some agreements of strength for both sides. He asks you for $80, since you know he is just highballing you call him out on it. Break it down to the root of the problem. Ask him if he is willing to take $30... and when he says no (they always do) dig deep into possible agreements like buying a hammock and a picture for $40. These negotiations are the hardest to have with a rational principle negotiation, but I can't think of any better practice! Give it a shot! I promise you'll have fun with it.<br /><br />I think this book is a must read for any business person or lawyer, but, as I said earlier, is incredibly helpful for everybody else too. It's a short read and it's really pretty fun. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.offers, they may have someone else there playing good cop, bad cop or in the worst case, uses threats to try and get their way.

B002VECLVO|4.0|\\"A Single Man\\" is an all-around beautiful film. It is visually beautiful, using its lighting and color palettes to their full potential to dazzling effect. The score, a slow, meditative, haunting orchestral arrangement by Abel Korzeniowski is also beautiful, and flows seamlessly with the cinematographic offerings of the film. But the true beauty in \\"A Single Man\\" lies in its characters, who are flawed and broken and striving to be human in this cold, cruel world in which we live.    The film is mostly the story of one character, the titular single man, George, played flawlessly by Colin Firth. George is a college professor in California in the 1960s. George is gay in a time when being so is not particularly acceptable. George had a partner, Jim, who was the love and light of his life, until he perished in a car accident, and now George has nothing. George is a broken, hollow, empty man who is simply going through the motions.    The film is almost a stream of consciousness, following George as he goes about a day in his life. They day is not unusually eventful: George teaches a lecture, goes to the bank, has dinner with an old friend. And yet the film revels in every minute of this man's life, observing him with a careful, watchful, nonjudgmental eye. The film focuses on George's interactions with everyone around him, and capture beautifully the distance and isolation George experiences from everyone else in the world. George is single not only in relationship status, but he feels ultimately and tragically alone, unable to form connections with anyone around him. The story in the film may seem light to some, and in many ways that is the point: this is an ordinary day in the life of an ordinary man. George is not some action hero, and this isn't an action-packed day from a season of \\"24.\\" The film's beauty is in its subtlety and nuance, and the way Ford's camera patiently follows its characters in rapture, although nothing earth-shattering is happening, the focus ofthe film is on the little interactions that make up the human experience.    The theme of homosexuality is handled very well here: this is not a movie that has any sort of political agenda, nor should it ostracize viewers of any sexual persuasion. The film is about raw human emotion, about love and loss and the grief every human being feels when he or she has lost someone important. The emotions George feels, the experiences he has are all part of a greater universal, the Human Experience. In perhaps the best crafted scene in the film, George goes swimming with another character, and in that silent, wordless moment as they're tossed about by the violent waves, there seems to be a greater level of understanding than there is between anyone in all the rest of the film, no matter how many words are exchanged. Perhaps that is the great unifier: the thing we have in common is that we are each of us alone in our search for understanding, and that the moments of human connection that come and go are what we live for. George's individual concerns, therefore, are not his alone, but shared by all of humanity. George is, after all, but a single man.
0385512058|5.0|The book of the week was Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi. I can't remember the last time a book has motivated to change my lifestyle so much. This book was recommended by a friend of mine and has given me a new appreciation for the relationships in my life.<br /><br />The main idea of the book is to develop as many lifelong relationship as possible. Getting away from the casual acquaintance and start real solid relationships with depth and value. Additionally, each relationship you create should involve love, reciprocity, and knowledge. You need to love for the person you are in a relationship with (this is not a romantic love, but a genuine care of well-being for the other person.) You need to show reciprocity because you will only get as much as you give. And quite frankly, the moment you stop worrying about what you will get in return and start caring about how you can truly give, you will have everything you desire and more (you can still ask friends for what you want, you just shouldn't base your relationship off what you will ultimately get). Lastly, you need to share knowledge in each relationship. This will be the foundation of many great relationships in your life. You know something stuff they don't know, and they know some stuff you don't know so share your knowledge with each other and advance each other's lives.<br /><br />One idea I found incredibly useful in this book was that there are two parts to utilizing relationships to reach your goals. The first part is giving, like I said earlier, you need to give everything you have to people in your relationships. This will take a lot of time and energy, but it will be well worth it. It may include getting a friend an internship, or mentoring someone, or being a regular listener. Can you imagine what you would do for the person that got you your dream job, or introduced you to your \\"hero\\"? You would probably go to the ends of the Earth to give that person whatever they asked of you. And that brings me to the second part... Asking people in your relationships for what you need. If you want something and you know someone that can give it to you then you need to ask them for it. If one of you relationships has connections to you hero, ask them to introduce you. Too often people just don't want to ask, they feel embarrassed or they feel like they don't want to \\"owe someone.\\" Well that's non-sense, if you have effectively created a solid relationship then you shouldn't have any problem asking someone for a favor. And so what if you \\"owe someone?\\" Personally, I love to help people... anything a friend of mine needs I will do my best to get it to them. In fact, this whole blog is dedicated to helping people. I have a sincere desire to help people get more money and be more successful. I am sharing my knowledge with the world and I am available to any of my readers for questions they might have.<br /><br />A quote from the book that particularly hit me was this: \\"Love, Reciprocity, and Knowledge are not like bank accounts that grow smaller as you use them. Creativity begets creativity, money begets more money, knowledge begets more knowledge.... And most importantly, giving begets giving\\"<br /><br />I am going to attempt to kindle as many of my acquaintances into solid relationships as possible. I know that when I start doing this a lot of people will shy away and many won't respond, but the few that will may turn into very successful relationships. The more people I have strong relationships with, the more people I will be able to help in a personal way. I challenge you to start building your own lifelong community of colleagues, contacts, friends and mentors. Pick up this book, everyone can take away great tips and ideas to incorporate in their own lives. It has very powerful ideas that will change the way you look at the relationships you have. The results will fill your life with everlasting success and happiness.Ferrazzi has an amazing story and you will most definitely another one of his books here in the not to distant future! If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.in the not to distant future!

1416583408|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. I learned or confirmed my own suspicions about why dogs act as they do in reading this book. Alexandra Horowitz has a wonderfully warm but not sentimental writing style. I was fascinated by her research and reread many passages. One of those books I just hated to finish. I cannot imagine a dog lover not enjoying this rare revisioning of the creatures we thought we knew and loved so well. I do look at my sweet collie with new eyes and try to listen better. Thank you Alexandra. More please!   PS: I do wish Pumpernickel could have graced the front dust cover.
159562015X|4.0|The book of the week was Strengths Finder 2.0 by Tom Rath. This book was a recommendation of Amazon and I didn't know what to expect when I bought it. However, Amazon's recommendations have led me to great books in the past and I wasn't disappointed by this one either. That being said, the book's format definitely threw me. There is only about 50 pages worth of reading because the main point of this book revolves around an online test. You read about 50 pages about the importance of your strengths and identifying them and then you log into the strengths finder website, using a one-time code in the back of the book and take your strengths finder test. The results will bring up your top 5 character themes out of 34 different types. The point of identification is to help you improve on your best traits. The book helps you do this by giving you a summary of your 5 different themes, showing quotes from people with the different themes and creating a personal action plan to get your specific themes even stronger. Like a muscle... a great personality theme only gets stronger when it is worked out.<br /><br />I want to stress upon you the importance of identifying your strengths. So often people focus only on their weaknesses and tirelessly try and improve on the things that they are not good at. The problem with this mindset is that you will work yourself into the ground and will most likely never be as good as the best. A physical example would be basketball, if you are 5' 2\\", 130lbs and practice for hours everyday to be the next Shaq, you will eventually be on the court with a person 2 feet taller and 200 lbs heavier than you and they will have the advantage.. resulting in years of time that could have been utilized more effectively. Now I am not saying that you shouldn't focus on your weaknesses... you should be aware of all your weaknesses and try to improve those skill-sets, but it should not be the most important thing you are working on. If that same, 5' 2\\" 130 lbs person, was naturally great at writing, and worked tirelessly on improving their writing skills. It would come naturally and expediently... and they may become the next Mark Twain. In Strengths Finder 2.0 Tom Rath tells a story famously described by Mark Twain in fact. Story goes, a man was at the Pearly Gates and asked Saint Peter a question... \\"Who was the greatest general of all time?\\" Saint Peter responded, \\"Oh that's simple, It's that man right over there.\\" The Gentleman said \\"You must be mistaken, I knew that man and he was just a simple laborer.\\" Saint Peter said \\"That's right, He WOULD have been the greatest general of all time, if he had been a general.\\"<br /><br />It is very important to analyze yourself and find out what your real talents are... To put this in terms of getting rich: If you find that you are great at marketing, but don't have the ability to negotiate, hire, speak publicly, budget etc... you build yourself a team. If each person in your team is as expert in their given field as you are at marketing, you'll have a cash-cow team! Whatever product or service you decide to dive into will be a winner. Additionally, it is important to know what your natural talents are when making the transition from school to the \\"real world.\\" When you find your natural talents, you can represent yourself accurately and impressively to potential employers and really land yourself a great career path.<br /><br />My 5 character themes after taking the Strengths Finder 2.0 was Achiever, Competition, Maximizer, Futurist, and Learner. I think it is very accurate and I will use my newly acquired action plan to strengthen my skills in those areas. I also know I need to keep a look out for the additional 29 character themes within people to make my professional network a complete powerhouse! One of the most important things I have learned is: You can't be the best at everything by yourself, so surround yourself with people that compensate for your shortcomings.<br /><br/>I recommend this book to absolutely everyone. The book will take about 45 minutes to read and the quiz should take about 30 minutes. The results will really help you identify your talents. It is very difficult to self-identify all your strengths so use this book as a resource. If you have any questions on the book don't hesitate to ask. I would be more than happy to help anyone that wants it.lutely everyone. The book will take about 45 minutes to read and the quiz should take about 30 minutes.

B0001US62I|5.0|The 1987 film &#34;Angel Heart&#34; should be considered, fundamentally, a mystery. Its a mystery in the sense of what the ancient Rosicrucians and other such mystical societies meant by that term: a spiritual truth made known to man by divine revelation.  Harry Angel, a private investigator, is searching for Johnny Favorite. According to the Christian myth, Lucifer was God's favorite angel until he was replaced by the heavenly father's human creation (and we humans have been caught in this jealous struggle ever since). Even Johnny Favorite's original name was Liebling (German for &#34;dearest or most precious&#34;). Many religions and mystics speak of humans as half animal and half divine - that would make us all, in a way, &#34;hairy angels&#34;.  In the film the heart represents the center of the self, the divine aspect - and it was the heart that the infernal Johnny Favorite tore out of Harry Angel to take the innocent's place in the world and submerge his baser identity. &#34;Angel Heart&#34; is about the search for lost identity (the original case of identity theft, I suppose - in a metaphysical sense). Are we also, to one degree or another, private investigators of the soul, searching for our lost selves? This movie is filled with this kind of religious symbolism and Jungian archetypes.  In a way it asks what came first, the chicken or the egg?  Was it the creator or its creation?  There's the character, Dr. Fowler (the drug addicted physician) - even his name is symbolic (&#34;a handler of fowl&#34;) juxtaposed to the voodoo rites involving the handling and sacrifice of chickens in spiritual rituals. I see the chickens in &#34;Angel Heart&#34; as representative of the life force (the carrier of the egg, or &#34;the Soul&#34;, afterall). Fowler is a man of science which, in many ways, is our modern world's new priesthood of materialism. Science's  relationship with the life force has, of course, been quite self-destructive - besides the great comforts and breakthroughs in knowledge its created it has also brought about nuclear weapons and other meltdowns of the natural world. In addition, western man has become addicted to technology and increasingly under &#34;the spell&#34; of materialism. Beyond the layer involving the christian myth - Lucifer and the fall of humanity - the film also has the greater Jungian perspective that takes in all religious myth along with individual dreams. Carl Jung's central idea is what he calls the &#34;process of individuation&#34;, which is what he feels leads to consciousness, to completeness (like a flower opening to sunlight). This involves confronting ones &#34;shadow&#34;, which is basically the unconscious, negative part of ones psyche (the image in the mirror to painful to ponder). In the context of the film, the black race, as portrayed in Harlem and New Orleans, is shown as a societal projection of &#34;the shadow&#34; - one that white-western man has demonized as something to be kept apart and to be feared. Harry Angel's intrusion into this world is seen as something taboo and dangerous for he's venturing into an area thats &#34;for colored patrons only&#34;, one in which the white man is not suppose to participate. This confrontation with the dark-side, &#34;the shadow&#34;, contains the truth of who one really is as an individual, which is beyond good and evil and the world of duality - of heaven and hell. Jung speaks of &#34;the anima&#34; which in the case of the male is the totality of the unconscious feminine psychological qualities that he possesses. The anima (or dream-girl) is an archeptype of the collective unconscious (which all individual psyches emerge from) and it will manifest itself in life and by appearing as figures in dreams (I hear Rourke whistling &#34;Girl Of My Dreams&#34; in the background). Jung wrote that confronting ones &#34;shadow&#34; is an apprentice-piece, while confronting ones &#34;anima&#34; is the master-piece. The character Epiphany is a pure anima figure. The word epiphany also has the definition, among others, as &#34;a manifestation of deitys on earth such as angels appearing to mortals&#34;. Harry Angel is drawn to her in his search, spiritually and erotically, because he seeks to be re-united with the unconscious aspect of his true identity - the one that was there before the original fall, before he hid himself behind a mask (what Jung refers to as &#34;the persona&#34;- the front that one presents to the world). But first Harry needs to confront the shadow-side, make the blood sacfrifice and make his hellish descent. This has to happen before he can ever be redeemed and experience grace - he will have to do his time in Hell. This is like Dante wandering through Hades before he can find his feminine ideal, Beatrice ( another classic anima, &#34;Girl Of My Dreams&#34; figure).  The vicious attack dog that chases Angel is a contemporary hellhound which in myths are often depicted as chasing a lost soul - &#34;There's A Hellhound On My Trail&#34;, to quote the great bluesman Robert Johnson.  One could also say, &#34;A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall&#34; (to quote Bob Dylan) in discussing another reoccuring image in the film. The rain can be seen as a cleansing of the soul, a purification, which first must come with judgement and personally being held accountable for who and what one REALLY is. After that its possible to be resurrected, to be whole - the final flowering of the individuation process. Its not by coincidence that Lucifer the Angel in ancient texts has been referred to as &#34;the bringer of light&#34; (the latin translation of the name) since its his intervention that forces the hero to confront his real self. Its funny that I've seen people refer to this film as a simple story - I guess they also consider the bible simple, too.<br /><br />  In some ways the most fascinating level going on in &#34;Angel Heart&#34; is that Mickey Rourke seems to have been acting out the mythic story in his &#34;real&#34; life.

1412960991|4.0|I used this boos as one of the key references for the research part of my MBA dissertation.  Pretty handy and practical tools and quite good frameworks for structuring the whole work.  I liked this and especially the pictures a lot.    - Hanna
0446567329|1.0|Predictably terrible writing. I'm half way through the book and rapidly skimming. I won't be too anxious to buy another Nicholas Sparks book.
B001PO53IO|4.0|The only downside with this series that I will mention, is the fact that it has a little too much violence in it for the youngest audience. And for those of us who grew up with Star Wars in the 80', it feels a little lightweight
0060557818|2.0|I had such high hopes for Neil.  Sandman is great, I love his girlfriends music, and my favourite modern author holds him in such high esteem.  And then....  That's it.  Neverwhere is just a deflated random mess.  It is at best a diverting read, but at this point the premise has been done so many times, and better, that the book is not recommendable.  It's..Tales of the Nightside, but not that good.  Actually if he had kept it to a Nightside length he might have been okay.  The characters are cutouts, the premise shaky, dialogue cliche', and descriptions vague and unimaginative.  If he wants to do a sequel, which was left wide open, I might give him a try after so long to dial in his long story craft, but really, this book is bad, I'm only going to try one more novel before giving up on Neil as a long story author..He is of course still brilliant as a screen (Coraline) and comic (Sandman) writer.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I loved this film.<br /><br />Why? Because I left the theater feeling encouraged. Blind Side shows that there is hope, even in the roughest of places, and that a different life is just a few choices away. And it manages to do it without uber-cheese and contrived emotional set-ups.<br /><br />Michael spends his nights at the mercy of people, and if he finds no mercy he makes do. That's just what his life is, the hand he has been dealt. Leigh Anne is a wealthy electrically-charged wife, mother, business owner who doesn't listen to excuses or consider anything contrary to what she wants as a final answer.<br /><br />When Leigh Anne finds Michael headed toward the high school gym on a night where there was no mercy available, she takes him home and into her family. Day by day, realization by realization, each of them are changed and their lives meld together.<br /><br />There are tearful moments and ones filled with laughter and often both at the same time. The fact that this story is based on a true one makes it all the more uplifting.<br /><br />Parents need to be aware of a little language and some rough scenes in Michael's old neighborhood.<br /><br />Blind Side was so much better than I expected it to be and I had really high hopes.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|I saw this film at the local theater when it was released. I thought it was interesting until I saw Anna's interview with David Letterman. Well, Anna Wintour has as much personality as a mosquito...small and annoying (not to mention she looks like one with her Bob hair duo and sunglasses).   She really showed how irrelevant she could be.
0061876747|4.0|There's nothing ordinary about the thunder than rains on protagonist Adam Kindred's life in William Boyd's new thriller, Ordinary Thunderstorms. It takes a powerful suspension of disbelief to go along with Boyd as he transforms Adam from an academic climatologist to a homeless fugitive. Boyd's writing is so fine that a reader's disbelief remains suspended as Adam finds ways to survive and somewhat thrive under trying conditions. The descriptive language brings every scene to life, and the development of each character kept me engaged and interested throughout the novel. Ordinary Thunderstorms provides hours of entertaining reading, and enough unresolved by the end to expect and savor a rewarding sequel.<br /><br />Rating: Four-star (Highly Recommended)
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I initially borrowed this movie from the Library and it was then I decided that I had to have it for my collection.  This movie is better than PRIDE and PREDJUDICE! I've watched it at least 15 times now and never tire of it.  The storyline grips you right from the beginning and there are so many scenes in the movie that you'll replay them over and over again, especially the romantic scenes.  Both John and Margaret are played by two people that have real chemistry.  LOVE IT!!! You won't go wrong in purchasing this movie.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Jason Reitman impresses me every time. Previous films Thank You For Smoking and Juno show his progress up to this amazing film. I'm not really a big George Clooney fan, I kind of liked him in Michael Clayton (Although I couldn't really figure out what was going on in that movie, I was watching it on my iPod with loud music blaring throughout the rest of the car), but he has a great performance in this.     Other actors impressed me, that short dude from the Hangover proved himself as a semi-dramatic actor. His part in the film is partial comedy, but he cries. Of course, he cries in The Hangover too. Hmm.    There's Jason Bateman, who I love from Arrested Development and not much else, was in there as Clooney's boss, he did a good job of being the boss that makes decisions you hate. And Anna Kendrick . . . that was a risky move. Going with an actor from Twilight isn't really the way to make an Oscar Best Picture (Winner? Fingers crossed) but she proved herself in this. And she wasn't one of the sparkly douchetes (from what I've heard. Never saw it. I try to avoid films directed at pre teen girls). Apparently, she played one of the slightly competent humans. I can't see her drinking blood anyway.    Oh! And that dude from Pineapple Expres! The guy who wouldn't die, every time they tried. He was in it too! Kinda different character, instead of an injured drug dealer he's a poor fiance of Clooney's sister. His character's sister, not his real-life sister.    They made some weird choices with the actors, but they paid off. I already saw this movie twice, and already I can't wait for the DVD. Oh, and the story. That was good. Written well. Good time for the plot. The plot's about a guy firing people for a living. Kind of depressing . . . Reitman likes characters that are . . . different. Tobacco lobbyist, pregnant teen, and firer . . . is that a word? Fireist . . . Fireman . . . they have a name for it, I just don't know it. I'll go with fireman. So the fireman is very isolated in his life, and by the end of the film has changed his view on how we should live. At the start he thinks that our lives are easier without other people, but by the end, he gains an understanding of how valuable other people are to our lives. Some of the characters he fires come back and explain how they wouldn't have survived being laid off without their family members. So he learns something. Yay! The point is, this film is great, it took risks not only with actors but with the topic itself, and they worked. So it makes a good film.
B00005MP58|1.0|Jennifer Ehle is too fat. I am a fat woman, so I'm not dissing fat women. She doesn't have the sparkle that Lizzie exudes in the novel.  Colin Firth would be better playing a pugilist. He has no class at all.   Entire film was a disappointment.
B002WY65W4|3.0|Let's set our Way-Back Machines to 1968. A young director named George Romero has just released a new, low-budget zombie flick called Night of the Living Dead. Although I never did get into that one, I loved the 1978 sequel Dawn of the Dead which I renamed Zombie Mall. Since then, I've seen several zombie flicks, and while very few have risen to the level of Dawn of the Dead, there are stand-outs including Resident Evil, Shaun of the Dead, and South Park's \\"Pinkeye\\" episode. ZOMBIELAND is not on that short list.<br /><br />To be fair, ZOMBIELAND is worth seeing if you don't mind a good amount of unspecified gore. It's a high-budget take on a low-budget flick. The acting is serviceable with Woody Harrelson being the best of the bunch. But there's really nothing new here. There are a couple of laughs, including a cameo by Bill Murray and a quest to find Twinkies, but this is mostly ground that has been covered, and much of it was covered in 1978.<br /><br />Even so, ZOMBIELAND is the perfect movie for beer and pizza night. No need to pause it during bathroom breaks.
B002I6X8N0|1.0|I was told by friends that if I liked the Harry Potter series, I would love Percy Jackson.  Well, my friends were right and wrong.  I loved the Harry Potter books: hated the Percy Jackson.  I immediately was taken by the great similarity between PJ and HP: boy at a special school, seemingly always in trouble, instead of the jagged scar of HP, PC is dyslexic and has ADHD, two great friends, one male and one female, a school protagonist on the order of Draco Malfoy, half blood genetics (not mud blood), an invisibility HAT (not cloak), going on a special mission, people trying to kill him, teachers who either like or dislike him, who does not really understand \\"what\\" he is, mother killed off early in the first book, step-father who is almost a clone of Uncle Vernon, bizarre foods, etc, etc, etc. The book also imitates Frank Baum's \\"Auntie Em\\", although this Auntie is not the nice Kansas aunt of the Wizard of Oz, but Medusa in the veil of a lonely old lady who wants to turn her pent up hostility against others by turning them into stone statues for her garden. In this it strikes very much like C. S. Lewis' \\"The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.\\"  I constantly asked myself, \\"What next?\\" Was Riordan going to take ideas from \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" or \\"The Caine Mutiny\\" perhaps? From what other books could Riordan have taken ideas and then amalgam them as his works. While not truly identical, the similaries strkingly jump out at the reader who has read Rowling, Baum, and Lewis.  If there was one saving grace in this series perhaps it is that the mythological relationships and stories of the ancient Greek gods are made a bit more understandable.  I would not recommend this book. It is very much an imitation of Harry Potter. And a BAD one at that.
B001E45XT4|2.0|Plantronics usually makes great headsets so I was very disappointed with these.<br />That said, they are cheaper than dinner so it's hard to complain too much.<br />If you absolutely can't spend more than $30 on a headset this might be the best you can do.<br /><br />Things that weren't great:<br />- When you put these on you can hear everything around you perfectly.<br />- Speakers are shooting through a plastic grate with small holes in it.  Resultant range is poor.<br />- Mic quaility is poor.<br />- Giagantic.  Colossal.  People will feel sorry for you - even your family and friends.  Friends and family spontaneously laughed at me when I had these on.  I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Things that were nifty:<br />- Mic can be folded up into headset and hidden (though you'll probably never want to go out in public with these - see above).<br />- Inline volume control comes with clip so you can clip it onto your clothes so when/if you stand up you don't rip the headphones off your head.<br /><br />I ended up buying Creative HS-980 MK II to replace these and gave these to my kids.
B000002C25|4.0|It's striking how much the reviews of \\"Be Here Now,\\" positive and negative alike, refer to the hype and criticism the album received when it came out.  Listening to this album for the first time today, without context, without the Gallagher brothers swaggering around acting like arseholes on TV or whatever it was that has earned them so much enmity, I thought it was great. I was blown away by the opening track \\"D'You Know What I Mean?\\" and had to listen to it twice before I could move on to the rest. The slide sound of the guitar on \\"Fade In-Out\\" stands out, and \\"All Around the World\\" rises to a crescendo of ridiculousness that's actually exhilarating. These songs are long, but they are packed with hooks. The album sounds familiar to me -- not derivative, but like an old friend, somehow. I can tell even sober that \\"Be Here Now\\" would be awesome if I was drunk, and I call that a good thing.<br /><br />A lot of the positive reviews urge people who have dismissed Oasis or this album to give it a second chance. I want to tell people like me, who were never on the bandwagon, to give it a first. It's accessible and loud and really fun.
B000002J1L|4.0|Nursery Cryme - Genesis (3.56 stars)<br />Original Release: 11/26/1971<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />The Musical Box (4 stars)<br />The story behind this song and the lyrics are so distant from one another that it requires some imagination to connect the two.  To appreciate this song you must find out the story from the album liner or some other source.  Also, I have heard that the onstage performance that accompanies this song live probably aids very much in making meaning of these lyrics.  I will probably want to find a youtube video of a live performance of this song sometime and watch it.  The song starts after a murder (the \\"nursery cryme\\") has occurred.  The music is calm, even sedate but its tone inhabits somewhere in the vicinity of a quiet madness.  Very gradually the melodic themes pick up more intensity for a time and then relax again.  There are extended instrumental sections and an aggressive fanfare on guitar and organ which coincides with part of the stories' drama where the concentrated passion of a lifetime is released.  The song comes to a conclusion with a more joyful energy that detracts a little from the mythic horror of the rest of the song and even ends on a kind of a joyful, \\"happy\\" note.  This song requires a lot of work to get its full value but if you meet it half-way it is rewarding.<br /><br />For Absent Friends (3 stars)<br />After the horrors of the previous song I tend to see shadows of the former song in this seemingly innocent one where a girl is seen passing by alone.  Also the song mentions that once there was four but now only two into which I find myself thinking of the couple and their murdered son and institutionalized daughter.  It is as likely that this song has no relationship to the former and is simply a stark contrast with the former placed for maximum effect.  Quiet, layered guitar and gentle vocals relax the mood nicely.<br /><br />The Return of the Giant Hogweed (3 stars)<br />Intentionally silly song anthropomorphizing an exotic that has taken over the British landscape.  Guitar and organ play a semi-comical war march to the lyrics.  There is an instrumental section called \\"The Dance of the Giant Hogweed\\" which I imagine abstracts the work of the ill-tempered weed to bring their plot to \\"fruition\\". The venomous oath of the Hogweed is finally sung and an ominous guitar and organ and mellotron passage announces the chaos of war thereby concludes the song.  To me the lyrical joke runs on a bit long in this long but entertaining song.<br /><br />Seven Stones (4 stars)<br />Cases of individuals following their hunches or suspicions or intuitions are presented in the guise of the wise old man's stories.  But the wise old man turns a trick in the end.  A sometimes awkward rhythm section underlies this simpler composition.  But the lyrics and the mellotron pump in mystery and passion to bring to this song a timeless mysticism.<br /><br />Harold the Barrel (3 stars)<br />Clever dark comedy about a man who is living out the last unbearable moments of his life before taking the plunge from a tall building.  Presented in a play format the protagonist is obviously surrounded by a society who seems insanely unprepared to rescue him.  The instruments play an upbeat, light tone until the very end where profoundly sad piano chords escort poor Harold into the next world.<br /><br />Harlequin (3 stars)<br />I'm not able to make sense of the lyrics; they seem to describe a scene and to explain something...  Otherwise the instruments play in a straight-forward, syncopated way.  The song has a quiet baroque feel with gentle harmonies and delicate sounds the never escape their calm demeanor.<br /><br />The Fountain of Salmacis (5 stars)<br />This song compellingly tells a story that could be right out of Ovid's _Metamorphoses_ lending the ancient story a beautiful soundtrack.  The pace never lets up as various musical ideas play out in time with the tale.  In the moment of transformation the supernatural transformation is uniquely represented instrumentally but seemlessly with the song's overall flow.  Instrumental sections keep the story moving without lyrics and lyrical sections progress elegantly and imaginatively.  After making a full circuit the song returns to its original theme before moving into a glorious coda.  Although this coda also aims at a \\"happy ending\\" it has a better fit to the song overall and features a sumptuous guitar passage that has a beauty all its own.  One of the first great progressive rock songs.<br /><br />Album:<br /><br />In some ways this album, which has been referred to as a transitional album in many reviews, spells out a transition within the order of its songs.  \\"The Musical Box\\" seems to harken back to the bitter darkness of _Trespass_.  The middle songs reveal the humor and more straight-forward song style that would be present going forward.  The dialogue of voices in some songs would also make very significant (in the history of classic prog rock) appearances later.  \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" would tie the musical complexity of _Trespass_ back into this Genesis' greater song compositional skills and be a bar set for later highly instrumentally imaginative rock.  In some ways the hard rock edge of _Trespass'_ \\"The Knife\\" is more present here as if that last song on the previous album anticipated this one.  As with Jethro Tull's work during this same time period I find that my overall rating of the album declines slightly even as I can see a progression in the band's compositional abilities.  But for all the great prog bands the next few years would be a sort of climax time of progressive rock as the greats of the genre seemed to peak more or less together in their ability to produce timeless music.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />Nursery Rhymes (4.25 stars)<br />1.

B001PJRAUS|1.0|I was so disappointed by this crude movie!! I love Jane Austen and this movie had what sounded like a fun plot but was awful. Very offensive and hated the ending. Best advice: don't watch it!!
B0025KVLUQ|4.0|The product was shipped in a timely manner. It was priced fairly. The shipping package was sufficient for the CD. I have not listened to the CD so I have nothing to say about the quality of the disk itself. No complaints about the purchase process.
1434102815|4.0|With all of the great reviews posted about The Elements of Style, it is a difficult to add anything that hasn't been said before. The Elements of a Style is a great book that will help improve your writing - regardless of how well you write at present. This book is one that writers will want to keep handy.<br /><br />One of the few drawbacks of The Elements is that it may make people self conscious about all of the mistakes that they have been making in their writing. A bigger problem, as many reviewers have pointed out, is that some of the advice is dated because it is based on the way Americans spoke and wrote in the past.<br /><br />I recommend The Elements of Style.
1573300403|4.0|who's bright idea was it to make this dvd double sided??? i feel like im back in the early 90's having to flip over my laserdisc lol
0061231401|5.0|Unexpected twists and turns.  Great use of action, suspense and cutting edge technology.  Doesn't abuse sex and poor language.  Stays fairly politically indifferent.  Really well done.  If you don't enjoy this you are too picky.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|i'd like to start off by saying this isn't exactly a sequel, obviously judy garland isnt in it, and obviously this time around its a lil 9yo girl instead of a 16yo girl. But the story is still great, even though this movie got extremely mixed reviews. i'm on the side that fell liking it. From what i've read, this movie falls a lot darker then the first movie. Its more in tune to the original books, than its first movie counterpart. but it still has that great magical feeling to it. i honestly suggest people purchase this dvd, its worth the buy.<br />the ruby slippers from movie one, do make a come back. and i thought i saw glinda the good witch of the north in one scene but that was explained to be...<br />anyway as for the features in this dvd, its also dubbed in french, like thats a real popular language here ugh, spanish would of been preferred. there is an interview with the actress who played dorothy that was made in 2002 i believe. this dvd also includes the original theatrical trailer, and a few tv spots. this movie runs a total 1hour 40minutes.<br />and if you didnt already know, this movie isnt really for kids, its for teenagers and adults or even people who've seen the original wizard of oz as kids and who are now adults. give this movie a try, i'm sure you'll enjoy it all.
B002UZXJA6|2.0|Don't look for too many familiar faces because only Chloe and Lisa are left from the original Celtic Woman cast.  There are literally only TWO good songs on the entire disk; so disappointing!  Most of the songs are tired and boring and two are actually converted pop songs (Fields of Gold, You'll Be in My Heart), ridiculous!  Very few have anything to do with Irish music, and only one is actually in Irish, Níl Sé'n Lá, which is the only great track on the disk and the only reason I'm giving two stars instead of one.  My Lagan Love is the only Irish traditional song.  The rest is just filler and nothing I'll ever listen to again.  Just download the two good songs I mentioned and skip the rest of this lame album.  I'll be sticking to the other three CDs in the future!
0061120073|5.0|This is an incredible coming of age story that everyone should read regardless of social class, race, etc.  It is the story of Francie Nolan and her often impoverished family and their daily struggles to put food on their plates and to become educated.  Francie's voice is so innocent and perceptive as she narrates her family's history, the Brooklyn neighborhood she was raised in and the adjustments she must make as she grows older.  She is able to find pleasure in the simplest of things, yet her life is a constant struggle filled with small joys and immense tragedies.  Smith's beautiful writing immerses the reader in the Nolan's lives, effectively conveying the atmosphere of their existence and defining the era.  I was so absorbed in this novel and am thrilled that I was prompted to read it for my book club.  It will be a favorite that I will recommend and revisit over the years.
159562015X|5.0|I originally purchased this book because I was required to take the online assessment for a program I am in.  I went from being very skeptical to really liking the strengths based approach.  I found the online assessment included with this book very accurate and relatively easy to access.  I took this assessment as part of a team building exercise and the results of my teammates' actually provided some useful insights.  I would highly recommend this book.
B00243FQFA|5.0|This is a great series to begin with.  Sad that it's the fifth and final season.  I loved Atlantis better than SG-1 because it is just some much more funny.
B00387YA6C|5.0|Nothing like the books, some of the same characters and same basic tragedy, but most if not all of the events differ from the books.  This isn't a bad thing at all as long as you can avoid comparing them, both have interesting turns in events to enjoy.  By mid way through the episodes you can't wait to see what happens next... happy hunting ; )
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I grew up with the Beatles music. This has to be the BEST of Paul McCartney's pieces. The DVD is awesome, his contribute to John, was well done and as Paul sang it they showed flash backs of the Beatles younger days...FABULOUSLY DONE!   This was a DVD/CD I enjoyed more than any of the others I have bought in the past years.   I think I have seen this in the 2 DVD's and 2 CD's as well which is the full version of the show. I would suggest that one over this one which only had the one DVD and 2 CD's.  Every moment of this is entertaining.  I bought one for myself and the full version for a Beatle Fan who can't stop watching it!
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|love the movie...love the music...but missing the wonderful song \\"the rocky road to dublin\\" by the Dubliners and not the High Kings as was noted in another review.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Just received this unit last week. Ordered for my school (music educator)& hope to share part of my vast LP collection with students in relevant settings. I'm still trying to get the sound right; the written instructions are vague & illogical...so it's trial & error! Previous reviews have been most helpful. THANKS!
B000P0J0EW|5.0|I was sold on this movie over 10 years ago and it still way outshines anything else, especially any other prison movie. I have seen it through from \\"start to finish\\" at least 12 or more times plus bits and pieces I have caught while channel surfing. Nominated for 7 Academy Awards this movie has a produced real cult following..(just Google it!!)  This DVD played smoothly right away with no extra codecs needed or anything else on my Windows 7 64 bit Acer laptop using the built-in Windows Media Player. That has not always been true for WMP in Vista and XP. Required codecs had to be purchased or pirated and that really stunk IMHO. I met Morgan Freeman in 2003 in Clarksdale,MS at an art gallery grand opening and thanked him for sharing his talent with the world. He was as regular a guy as you or I and a very cordial gentleman. He is also part owner of the Ground Zero Blues Club there in Clarksdale. A great talent and a great guy as comfortable to be around as an old shoe. This is the<br />- #1 BEST PRISON MOVIE EVER -  There is some graphic violence , graphic language and potentially offensive homosexual content FYI  Which is EXACTLY the way prison really is (I know.)<br /><br />You will love this movie , you'll never tire of it, you'll gift it to your friends (like I have done)and you'll be riveted from the very opening scene. The ENTIRE cast is so well placed which includes Tim Robbins, the warden, head guard and all the convicts. See for yourself. I can also recommend the 2 DVD special edition for great cast interviews and behind the scenes cool stuff. This is a classic movie and a keeper 110%
B001E95ZHY|3.0|Energetic and enthusiastic drummer Robert \\"Fish\\" Fishman (Rainn Wilson) is kicked out of the 80s rock band \\"Vesuvius\\" just before the other members make it big and enjoy huge success as rock star. Twenty years later still disgruntled Robert is seen working in office cubicle. When Robert loses the job, he is asked by his nephew Matt (Josh Gad) to play for his band's prom gig. As you will see, this turns out to be a good thing for Robert , Matt and other members of the band \\"A.D.D.\\" - Curtis (Teddy Geiger) and Amelia (Emma Stone).    The introductory part of \\"The Rocker\\" is clearly inspired by the real-life story of Pete Best (who appears briefly at the bus stop scene), the drummer replaced by Ringo Starr just before the Beatles made their debut, but the storyline itself is similar to some of the recent rock-themed films such as \\"The School of Rock\\" and \\"Rock Star.\\" This is a story you heard before, and it seems director Peter Cattaneo (\\"The Full Monty\\") is aware of that. There are new ideas (the jam session on the net with the naked drummer and its consequences) and some of them are very good, sometimes hilarious, but they are not fully developed.    Even those who don't mind the predictability of the film might find the unlikely hero \\"Fish\\" a bit annoying. If you don't like Jack Black's character in \\"School of Rock,\\" you will probably don't find Rainn Wilson's character very attractive, who is ten times louder than Jack Black's wannabe rocker. Fans of Christina Applegate (as Curtis's mother and Robert's love interest) and Emma Stone would be disappointed with the underwritten characters they are required to play.    \\"The Rocker\\" is a box-office flop in 2008 and I am not surprised to know that. It is not a bad film at all. This is a light-hearted, good-natured comedy that never takes off.
B0015HOFZI|4.0|Bought this a few weeks ago as a birthday gift to myself. If you have some vinyl lying around, and you aren't interested in a crazy-ass system that costs over $500, this is the turntable for you. It is shockingly easy to set up, and you'll be listening to your copy of Aerosmith's Greatest Hits within minutes of opening the box. In my experience, Sony stuff lasts the long haul, as long as you treat it right (turn it off when not using it, keeping it dust-free, etc).
B001FOPODS|3.0|I made the mistake of screening this for my kids one night via Netflix.  The animation is fantastic, but the film is beyond dark.  At one point, Peter's nemesis, the Wolf, swallows his pet Goose (yes the cute looking fellow you see Peter holding in the cover image) in a fairly graphic manner, which completely traumatized my children. Don't make the same mistake I did.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|I got into this album in some ways quicker than most other Dream Theater albums.  I also got out of it quicker, so far, than there other albums.  The music, as the title implies, is dark quite often, with more mellow, \\"lighter\\" parts there to balance out and give dynamics to the volume.  Track by track:  A Nightmare to Remember.   Very good song, long, often heavy, a number of samples, I like this song a lot, it worked better in a lot of ways though live, rather than on CD.  A Rite of Passage. The first single, another very good track, nice riff on the chorus, quite catchy, which was probably intentional.  Wither.  Never clicked so much with me, and I don't know why.  I did love the homage to Brian May (solo) in this song.  The Shattered Fortress.  The culmination of the AA storyline, containing all the themes therein.  If you were a fan of this piece of work, as I am, then you will love this piece.  The Best of Times.  Something I can relate to in a lot of ways, been through something superficially similar.  I must say I found the solo at the end to be scintillating.  The Count of Tuscany.  A love it or hate it song, I am one of those that loved it.  Some found the lyrics to be not to their taste but I really found I could care less.  The lyrics are interesting in that they are a personal story turned into a lyric, rather than the standard fantasy or political fare that has become far too common.  The volume swell solo in the middle is very ambient but at the same time somewhat compelling to me, and the outro is excellent as well.  My favourite song on the album.  So given all that, why only four stars?  This album contained a lot of the bright bits from DT's past, which is great, but I am not sure what I can see in their future which worries me. I am not sure that I expect the variety between albums anymore that DT fans had come to expect, and I am not sure where DT see themselves heading in the future.  I really hope I am wrong, I spent many years not liking thisband, many years ago, until it \\"clicked\\", and now that is has clicked with me, my expectations are (unfairly) high.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|Really nothing to add to what V.S. Romero and others have said, but heck, here's another score for it.    It is in fact a Gamecube controller, in white to match the Wii (looks real nice).  It is actually a Japanese import, which really doesn't matter at all.  All the buttons, Even the logo and Start/Pause button are labeled the same as they were on the U.S. versions.  It's kind of fun to see the Japanese packaging (and of course I can't read the manual...which I wouldn't have read anyway, given it amounts to \\"plug the controller in and play a game\\")    I'd love to be able to vouch for the cord being longer (and personally I VASTLY prefer wired controllers to wireless), but I live in a different place and have a different gaming setup than I did when I regularly played my Gamecube.  It's long enough to reach my bed without issues, and I know my Gamecube controllers I had to use extension cords, but I'm not sure if I'm the same distance from my TV or not.    Oh, and this would work just fine for Gamecube owners too-you don't have to have a Wii.    If you're ever planning on buying Gamecube games, whether for the Wii or Gamecube, I'd recommend stocking up on these while they're still available, since unfortunately the Classic Controller can't work for Gamecube games (the Wii just shuts off any extra stuff that was added on top of the Gamecube hardware when running Gamecube games) :(
1416549447|4.0|I read ChiRunning in Sep 09.  It took me 2-3 wks to get the form right while running.  I've been ChiRunning since.<br /><br />It's not effortless - my heart rate meter tells me so - though it does feel effortless for a whole minute or two doing medium sprints.  I now run 4x a week, an hour or two each time.  This is something I'd never been able to do in the past because my knees always started giving problems and I'd have to train on an elliptical afterwards.  The knees are fine now.  I'm sure Danny wouldn't recommend it, but you can even run on a bad knee with this technique - I ran 10k on a poor knee without much loss of speed.<br /><br />My timing has also improved, though not as much as I'd hoped or expected (hence 4 stars).<br /><br />Enjoy running?  You should give it a go.
B000002UB3|5.0|Amongst 13 of Beatles' output, I considered 'Abbey Road' (1969) as the best album they had made. I knew this album since my early childhood my dad had bought the cassette of it. It contained best effort of the Fab-Four's musicality and artistry, especially George Harrison's 'Something'. This is the main reason why I bought this album. This music of this album are were very advanced to its released date, and its influence is still remaining until now to the world's pop and rock music. So be it, this recording is very highly recommended to be purchased. Thanks also to amazon.com for quickly shipment to Indonesia.
B002GDM2UA|1.0|\\"Highlander - The Director's Cut\\" was received today and it is almost as much of a disappointment as the \\"Special Edition\\" DVD (which remains completely unviewable on a any TV larger than thirteen inches).    I am running the disc on a Samsung BD-C5500 Blu-Ray player to an LG 55\\" wireless 1080P LCD in a dedicated home theater and \\"Highlander\\" Blu-Ray is genuinely awful.    Fuzzy, dark, flashing heavy pixellation make this Blu-Ray at times almost unviewable.  Obviously little time was spent in restoring the original and little care was taken with the conversion to Blu-Ray.  For a classic cult movie the studio obviously felt that fans would accept anything that was even marginally viewable.    If you are a \\"Highlander\\" addict I supposed you could justify this just to say you have the film on Blu-Ray or that the superior \\"Director's Cut\\" is better (it is), but if you are looking for \\"Highlander\\" on Blu-Ray to be anything other than more nearly-unviewable garbage I would advise keeping your money in your pocket and not wasting the time or effort to be disappointed.
6304806418|5.0|This movie is an adaptation of the hit Broadway musical depicting the infamous real-life story of Eva \\"Evita\\" Duarte de Peron, the wife of President Juan Peron, who rose from poverty to become the most famous Argentine woman in history. Her huge political influence and constant charity works earned her scorn and fear from the military and upper classes but adoration and love from the workers and descamisados. Evita's legendary life is displayed before your eyes as the most hated and most beloved woman in Argentina. Madonna is superb, both in voice and screen presence. Pryce's performance is a triumph of the actor's craft. Banderos is also perfect. See Evita, if you haven't already. If you've seen it ten times, see it again. There is still more pleasure to take from this wonderful movie each time you see it.
0316044695|1.0|I'm genuinely sorry the author's comrades perished and I genuinely appreciate their service to our country.    Having sincerely said that, why their (poorly written) story gets overlaid with political screed is beyond me.    The \\"liberal media\\" forces \\"politicians\\" to create rules of engagement that hamstring soldiers.    If I could point out five things:    A. Other politicians (the term is an insult of course) like FDR and Lincoln used \\"rules of engagement\\" to win wars.  Consider how carefully Lincoln dealt with the border states in the Civil War.  Grant was keenly aware that alienating these states might lose the war.  Or how FDR made sure that Germany was the belligerent, not us.    Or consider how foolhardy the Germans were in World War II as they pillaged the Ukraine, etc, turning possible supporters into angry partisans.   Or the effect of the Germans plowing through Belgium in WW I.  Etc.    B. If you don't like my military analysis, consider what tactics seem to be working in Iraq and are now heavily employed Afghanistan at the military's behest -- of trying not to alienate Afghanis by killing civilians.  I wonder what Petraeus would think of this book's basic premise that any \\"military\\" tactic is acceptable.  \\"Military is in quotes.\\"    C. The author repeatedly points out the tribal culture, with a sense of vengeance, and the key role they can play in supporting (or not supporting) the Taliban.  Given those views, isn't treating the tribes with as much respect as possible sure seems to make as much sense.    D. The author has grave concerns about being beheaded by the Taliban (which is understandable) but somehow thinks shooting civilian shepherds is ok.  hmm.    E. Was it the liberal media that caused their radio to fail?  Maybe it was tuned into NPR.  Or if he was so concerned about the shepherds turning them, I think the \\"liberal media\\" would have tolerated (a) tying them up or (b) leading them at gunpoint out of the dead-end position the Seals had positioned themselves in, until they could find an exit route.     F. So the conservative media like Fox and the WSJ agree with killing civilians?  I think not.    The book would be 3 stars if it didn't harp on the politics.  But to me, a little military history should be part of the Seals training.
0783225733|5.0|It had been less than a year since man first walked on the Moon, but as far as the American public was concerned, Apollo 13 was just another routine space flight, until these words pierced the immense void of space, Houston, we have a problem. Stranded 205,000 miles from Earth in a crippled spacecraft, astronauts Jim Lovell, Fred Haise and Jack Swigert fight a desperate battle to survive. Meanwhile, at Mission Control, astronaut Ken Mattingly, flight director Gene Kranz and a heroic ground crew race against time, and the odds to bring them home. One of the most significant things about Apollo 13 is the fact that it managed to be such a strikingly realistic movie despite the abundance of well-known Hollywood actors. Tom Hanks, of course, can convincingly act any part in the world, and his role in Apollo 13 is no exception. All of the actors involved seemed to have been given parts that they were born to play, because they were so successful in the roles. The true events of the historic Apollo 13 mission are amazingly re-created here, and the results are spectacular. \\"Apollo 13\\" is an excellent story made even better by the fact that it is true, it has great acting, skillful direction, and plenty of tasteful humor. It is not only a highly entertaining movie, but is also a educational one.

B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Truman Burbank is a normal man, living in a normal town. He grew up to be a desk clerk for a insurance company, living an ordinary life, having an ordinary wife, an ordinary neighbour and an ordinary bud, who pops in from time to time with a sixpack. But Truman is not happy with his life. He wants to see the world. He wants to get away from his happy,happy, ever tidy, nice and shiny little island town at the seaside.

0767903374|5.0|Can't offer enough positive commentary about this book. It's been around awhile but wish I had found it sooner.  Being one of those remarkable 20% of the population who are born with very sensitive nervous systems, I had no idea this was a genetic trait.  Equally importantly, it is a highly valuable commodity both personally and publicly, for society.  That is - if this type of person understands the trait and how to work WITH IT, rather than fight against it or merely hide from life because he or she is so embarrassed about it.  This book and the accompanying series are self esteem boosting for sensitive/shy/environmentally overstimulated people and while every description will not fit every individual to a T, there is enough meat in here for sensitive souls to survive upon for perhaps the rest of your lives.  Why hate yourself or allow others to shun you for being VALUABLE, UNIQUE and GIFTED?  That is the primary lesson of this book.
B002XTXG1G|4.0|Tom Hardy magnetizes the screen with his performance as \\"Britain's Most Violent\\" criminal, Charlie Bronson. \\"Bronson\\" is a semi-true tale about how a man born Michael Peterson decided he needed money to support his wife and new baby, so the 19 year old robbed a post office..and then began his first jail term. Michael discovers his real calling is violence as mantel to fame. Before long, he has a reputation as brawler, a kind of anarchist inmate done up as circus strongman. In the one period he actually gains freedom, Michael heads off to a whorehouse, hooks up with trannies and prostitutes then becomes a prize fighter who gets christened Charlie Bronson by his roguish hustler/manager.<br /><br />Soon after, Bronson commits a crime that sends him back, and he becomes the celebrity Charlie. Hardy burns with the violence of a psychotic carny; he spends parts of the movies telling Bronson's story onstage in stylized characters. The guards are terrified of him, yet he takes all comers with an almost celebratory glee until he is left bloodied and - once again - free to expand on his legend. hardy also took on an amazing training regiment for the movie, gaining almost 42 pounds in bulk by doing 2500 push-ups daily to not only get into physical form, but the mental one.<br /><br />\\"Bronson\\" seethes with mentality. From the surrealistic asylum dance scene to the narrow cage Bronson is locked into at the film's end, the film applies its excessive violence without much rationale; Charlie acts violently because he just is. There are more than a few comparisons to [[ASIN:B000UJ48T0 A Clockwork Orange]] here (especially in the cross cutting between Bronson's monologues and his history) but this movie, due mainly to Hardy's stunning performance, packs a wallop that few others in the true crime genre can match.

0465011047|5.0|When only nine years old, the author (Kang Chol-Hwan), along with members of his family, was sent to political labor camp Yodok (Camp 15) in 1982 where he lived, studied, worked, and suffered daily abuse (beatings, near starvation, long hours and hard labor) for ten years. Originally Kang and his family surmised the reason for their imprisonment was his grandfather's often angry statements about North Korean management practices; later they learned it more likely was due to his grandfather having been associated with the losing side in a dispute between rival Japanese-Korean groups seeking support from Great Leader Kim Il Sung. Kang's \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" summarizes his life until his escape from North Korea and resettlement in South Korea. Kang's primary purpose is to describe the brutal treatment the North Korean government imposes on citizens it considers disloyal. Eventually Kang was invited into the White House to spend about 40 minutes with President Bush relating his experiences.<br /><br />Kang was born in Japan to the descendants of Koreans who had emigrated there for a better life. His father and grandfather were highly successful (casinos and other ventures), but lured into leaving for North Korea by false claims, the allure of helping the new nation get established, and Kang's mother - an ardent Japanese-Korean Communist Party member and advocate. Immediately upon arriving, they realized their mistake, but it was too late.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the initial years were good for Kang. Children received new shoes and a school uniform every three years, courtesy of The Great Leader. His family lived in a four-bedroom Pyongyang apartment with his little sister, paternal grandparents, and one uncle, and had a refrigerator, washing machine, vacuum cleaner, Japanese color TV and a Volvo they'd brought from Japan. At school, each class had a 'political leader' and a 'delegate' - appointed by the teacher and confirmed by a vote of the pupils. Kang was a delegate - until busted for leading about 14 others to skip school and go to the zoo. Top priority at school was given to learning the history of Kim Il Sung and his son Kim Jong-il. Everyone also signed up for the Pupil's Red Army - activities mainly consisted of marching with fake machine guns while singing.<br /><br />Then one day his grandfather disappeared despite having given his beloved Volvo, TV and most other riches to the state, and three months later the police were at Kang's house. All except Kang's mother were given a short time to pack a few things and loaded into a truck. Kang managed to take one of his prize fish tanks, but the fish soon died. Arriving at Yodok they found no faucets (water was about ten minutes away), mud floors and walls, and no heating/cooking fuel. Medical supplies and services were virtually non-existent. The work-day was dawn to dusk felling trees, tilling soil and mining gold, school began at 6 A.M. and was limited to the 'redeemables' that eventually would be released. About 70% at the prison were 'irredeemables' (eg. former land-holding families) who would never get out - their children received no education. Adult rations were 500 gms., and the food consisted largely of corn. Obtaining extra food (rats, snakes, berries, frogs, stolen corn, bugs, and rabbits) was essential for survival. Snitches abounded. Punishments included beatings, extra work, executions (Kang was forced to witness 15 executions, mostly for attempted escape) and possibly worst of all - the sweatbox. Those sent to the sweatbox (eg. withholding information) were forced to kneel inside for three months and had five years added to their unknown sentences. Clothes and shoes were poor quality and quickly fell apart - rags wrapped around one's body and feet often were the only protection against the snow and below-zero cold. Saturdays began with a two-hour criticism session.<br /><br />After ten years Kang and the rest of his family's names were unexpectedly readoff - they were ready for release. The likely rationale - their grandfather had died in another camp. Kang took a job as a deliveryman, and made considerably more on the side selling goods otherwise unavailable in one area or another. His youngest uncle went on to complete a PhD. in chemistry. Unfortunately, about five years after being released, two of Kang's supposed friends reported him and another for listening to South Korean radio. Faced with returning to prison, the two escaped to China, and helped by several Koreans legally living in China, they were smuggled out and made it to South Korea. (Remaining in China is dangerous - China actively cooperates with North Korea in seeking out and repatriating North Korean escapees found in its territory.) Six months of interrogation and supervision later, they were allowed to live among the general population. Kang still worries about the fate of his mother, uncle, and younger sister.<br /><br />Clearly, conditions within and rationale for North Korea's political prisons are inhumane and unjustified, though it is hard to fully appreciate the day-to-day hopelessness and abuse from just reading \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang.\\" Only one person is believed to have escaped a North Korean prison camp. The North Korea government says they don't exist - Google maps show otherwise, and experts estimate 150,000 - 200,000 prisoners currently within them, with another 400,000 prisoner deaths within the past three decades. A former North Korean military attache to Beijing has testified, backed up by documents and other defectors, that Camp 22 tested suffocating gas and poisons on its inmates; a former guard there testified that those who killed attempted escapees received a college education - obviously a temptation for abuse. Others received water torture, forced abortions, etc.<br /><br />Bottom Line: President Bush's statement \\"I loathe Kim Jong-Il\\" may have been impolitic; however, it was certainly justified.elease.

044654146X|5.0|I work in the Israeli hi-tech, and many things mentioned in the book were familiar to me but I still did not appreciate the magnitude of Israeli achievement.   Dan Senor and Saul Singer set the record straight. About time! I knew the 8088 assembler, and had read books on the design of the OS/2 operating system, but I did not know that the 8088 chip was designed in Haifa and the 386 in Jerusalem and that the whole world's production of the 386 chip during the Gulf War in 1991 depended on Israelis staying on schedule - even when missiles were falling on them.  But I could relate to how it must have felt. Only last year in January 2009 we continued discussing work in the safe room while the sirens warning of an imminent hit from Grad rockets launched some 40km away in Gaza  continued to scream.      The book manages to explain well the confluence of factors that made the Israeli hi tech miracle possible - the informality of the Israeli society, the questioning of authority, the role of the elite army units, the Israeli chutzpah, the commonality of purpose and the Jewish drive for excellence.  The authors in my opinion are somewhat downplaying the Jewish factor which is understandable since the point they are trying to make is that many of the experiences are transferable to other societies. Perhaps. But on the other hand many of the ingredients, the chutzpah, the common purpose, the questioning of authority are also a product of Jewish history and Judaism. If we compare the Jewish vs. Muslim Nobel laureates per capita contribution in the area of Chemistry, Physics, Medicine and Economics (the Peace and Literature are too politicized to be useful), we get the following:  There are 150 Jewish Nobel laureates out of 13.3 million Jews and there are 2 Muslim laureates out of 1.5 billion Muslims.  So the ratio is (150 /13300000)/ (2/1500000000) = 8458 - between 3 and 4 orders of magnitude.  The book quotes that between 1980 and 2000, Egyptians registered 77 patents in the U.S. Saudis registered 171. Israelis registered 7,652.  Since the population of Egypt is 78 million and Israel's is 7.2 we get a ratio of (7652/ 7200000)/(77/78000000) = 1151-  three orders of magnitude. In other words, the Jewish excellence in achievement in not a small factor of the Israeli miracle.    Chapter 14 is titled \\"Threats to the Economic Miracle\\" and it does discuss the Iranian threat. In my opinion, not enough.   Bernard Lewis, the foremost western scholar on Islam believes that the Iran cannot be deterred. He wrote: \\"In this context, mutual assured destruction, the deterrent that worked so well during the Cold War, would have no meaning. At the end of time, there will be general destruction anyway. What will matter will be the final destination of the dead--hell for the infidels, and heaven for the believers. For people with this mindset, MAD is not a constraint; it is an inducement.\\"  Somehow Bernard Lewis's opinion is either not well know or is disregarded.     I believe that US companies Intel, Microsoft and all others who have crucial R&D facilities in Israel could be more outspoken about the importance of their Israeli offices and the threat they are under.  It could be that they believe that the ingenuity, innovation and chutzpah they've witnessed through the years will be used once again by Israel to neutralize the Iranian threat helping both Israel and the US at the same time. I sincerely hope so too since this Administration still believes it is possible to negotiate with Ahmadinejad and does not take Bernard Lewis seriously.

B0000C3I6U|4.0|This is THE DVD of Bodybuilding.  Some might pass thinking that its some kind of workout video or instruction...IT IS NOT.  Its a genuine movie/documentry from the 70's.  This DVD has some things you just gotta love.  First and foremost is Arnold...the heelish king of the bodybuilding world.  Arrogant, commical, using low tactics to harrass and disrupt his competitions training, such as one instance he is doing squats with a fellow Bodybuilder at which time when the guy struggles Arnold like a good squating partner sarcastically quips \\"Come on...lets get serious\\", or another when he calls everyone from the beanpole to the superfreak in the gym \\"Big Mike, Big Tony, etc\\".  Arnold has charisma in rare form as he showdowns with Lou who is adversary of sorts.  Split shots create the story of the two's run at Olympia.  Lou is a simpleton, but a monster and is potrayed as the underdog...who never reaches the threshold of victory, as it belongs to Arnold regardless.  His father his confidon whom you can tell he knows is no benefit.  The communion affect between the bodybuilders is the real story.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|Although this album was created way back in 1974, the musical genre would fit perfectly along-side the likes of Radiohead's brilliant \\"Kid A\\" album, or Sean Lennon's tune, \\"Watching The Shadows on the Wall.\\"  It could even work with a playlist from Bjork, Blur, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Pulp or Radiohead - to name a few similarities<br /><br />\\"Red\\" contains thick, grungy bass riffs, (I really like that stuff, myself.)  And the unmistakeable choral sound of the Mellotron is a nice contrast layered over the bass and percussion.  More of an instramental work than a pop-vocal sound, the music on this album is definately symphonic rock.  I enjoy listening to this album at my day-job.  It's excellent music if you are in the design business.  It's not distracting.  It's got just enough edge and flow to help keep the creative juices flowing.<br /><br />If you happen to be a musician's musician, drummer Bill Bruford did drums with the band \\"Yes\\" during the late 60s and early 70s.<br /><br />If you like music to work by, design by, drive by, this album is sweet.

B001KVZ6ES|2.0|This movie is about the importance of collecting valuable possessions over your lifetime and giving them to who you think is most deserving. Clint Eastwood did not think his family was worthy of his car or the valuable set of tools he accumulated over 50 years, so he gave them to the Cambodian family from next door because they gave him food.

Director Lee Daniels does a great job at making Sapphire's amazing novel \\"Push\\" come to life. If you are looking for a light happy movie don't even come near to \\"Precious.\\" This movie is about as sad as the title is long. Daniels tries to keep people from breaking down by throwing in a joke here or there throughout the film, just enough to not become obnoxious and stray from the underlying theme.

She is even nominated for best supporting actress at the Academy Awards 2010.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I think sometimes when you've been in a rut looking for that next great read, you often find yourself reading books that just don't measure up.  For whatever reason lately it just seems like I've been reading books that aren't fun or exciting.  Maybe it's because I'm someone who loves the detail, mystery, intrigue, suspense and that ever elusive page-turning novel.  It's definitely hard to come by in my book (pun intended) but something I strive for each time I pick up something new.<br /><br />For me, this book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was everything I look for in a novel.  I enjoyed the level of detail, from the Vanger family (although I will say some of it, especially the names, can be overwhelming at times), to the plot twists and depth of characters.  Some of the foreshadowing was delightful and when you think you saw it coming (sometimes you can guess), another brick will hit you from the opposite direction and take you down a different path.<br /><br />In the end though and despite the multiple threads so wonderfully woven together, everything comes together in a very nice, neat little package.  But don't let this seemingly simplicity fool you, this book is a fun, engaging and exciting read - I couldn't put it down.  I really wonder what kind of research Larsson did for this writing because he doesn't spare the smallest (but relevant) of details.<br /><br />A while ago I had actually thought about purchasing the book (for my Kindle of course) but read a couple of reviews and decided against it.  I'm really not sure why I made that decision, so I had been sitting on the fence for awhile.  I later learned that a number of my family members including my wife had read the book and also loved it, so I jumped off the fence and bought the book.  And I'm truly glad that I did.<br /><br />I guess I don't really need to say anything else - there are a bunch of reviews which already explain the characters, their motives, the locale and the plot(s) twists.  So I guess my review is for those of you that are sitting on the same fence and just need that extra little nudge, believe me, you will be glad you decided to take that leap.<br /><br />Enjoy the book...and I'm just now starting on Larsson's second (The Girl Who Played With Fire) and have pre-ordered his third, which is due out in May.<br /><br />I just love it when I'm delightfully surprised - I think you will be too.you that are sitting on the same fence and just need that extra little nudge, believe me, you will be glad you decided to take that leap.

B001OQCV2E|1.0|Besides special effects, this movie is pretty tragic. For one it drags out to long. The plot just wasn't strong enough to carry this film through almost three hours. The only other descent part, aside from the special effects, was the message that you could only pay your way onto the survival ship, so only the richest of the rich would survive and everyone else will perish. Other than that the acting was a travesty. They wasted their real talent, Thandie Newton, and reduced her to mere eye candy. What a ridiculous waste of money! If you're going to make the millionth apocalyptic thriller movie, you need to come with something original. NEXT..
1400063515|1.0|The author is verbose and altogether too fond of the personal pronoun. The book is filled with valueless literary allusion and \\"clever\\" neology.

B0018AK9RA|5.0|Nostradamus is an amazing album. I'm into concept albums/rock operas. When I first heard that there was a Nostradamus concept album, I thought, \\"That's going to be fantastic, I have to get it.\\" My instincts were right. It's a metal masterpiece. I give it 5 stars because I can't give it 6 stars.<br /><br />I have to tell you that this is my first Judas Priest album, and therefore, their previous albums did not bias my review of this album. This is why you should listen to me. I have no prior knowledge of Judas Priest's earlier work. But I do know about other concept albums/ rock operas like Pink Floyd The Wall, Iron Maiden Seventh Son, and David Bowie Ziggy Stardust. Judas Priest's \\"Nostradamus\\" blows those other concept albums away. This album is so large in scope that other shorter albums have a hard time standing up against it. It's about 100 minutes in length. From start to finish, it is a very focused album with no filler. There was never a moment where I went, \\"Why did they do that, I don't get it?\\" And There was never a moment where the music lost the focus of a rock opera by allowing songs made for easy radio play to creep into the album. There are peaks and valleys all through this album, and never a moment to regret. This is intelligent sophisticated music. It demonstrates the musical mastery of Judas Priest.<br /><br />I have read other reviews on here and I realize that metal purists aren't going to love this album because of orchestral arrangements of most of the songs. Oh well, their loss. Like I said, THIS IS INTELLIGENT MUSIC. The orchestral arrangements create a very dark and timeless atmosphere that is not present on other concept albums. The atmosphere of this album is incredible. It's like you are traveling through space and time, and every now and then you get a glimpse of heaven or hell. You have to dim the lights to get its full effect.<br /><br />Now, most importantly. Does this album rock? Hell yes it rocks! Judas Priest made this album. That's probably why it is the best concept album that I have heard. They helped invent metal. What's cool about this album is that the heavy atmospheric music leads into fast rocking, guitar shredding tunes, with deep drum beats. It's awesome! Rob Halford's vocals are intense, dark, and powerful. The guy can sing, even in Italian.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Prophecy, Revelations, War, Sands of Time, Pestilence and Plaque, Death, Conquest, Persecution, Exiled, Alone, Visions, New Beginnings, Nostradamus, and Future of Mankind. Pretty much the whole album.<br /><br />This is a great album, Kudos to Judas Priest for having the guts to make something outside of the \\"heavy metal box.\\"<br /><br />UPDATE: 3-9-2014<br /><br />Recently, I've been getting real heavy into Judas Priest other albums like Pain Killer and Defenders of the Faith. And I came across the Nostradamus album again. So I decided to give it a listen...<br />I think it's one of Judas Priest's best albums, if not one of the best metal albums of all time. Because it's SOOOOOOOOOO DAMN EPIC and KICK ASS. I really don't understand why some people don't like this album.'s probably why it is the best concept album that I have heard. They helped invent metal. What's cool about this album is that the heavy atmospheric music leads into fast rocking, guitar shredding tunes, with deep drum beats. It's awesome! Rob Halford's vocals are intense, dark, and powerful. The guy can sing, even in Italian.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Prophecy, Revelations, War, Sands of Time, Pestilence and Plaque, Death, Conquest, Persecution, Exiled, Alone, Visions, New Beginnings, Nostradamus, and Future of Mankind.

B002NXSRVG|1.0|This movie was awful from start to finish. It was heartbreaking to see Dennis Quaid, Johnathan Pryce and Arnold Vosloo emasculate themselves. And Christopher Eccleston should have known better. We all know the economy is bad right now, but these guys are rich.     I'm not going to slash the entire production of this film, because the blame lies squarely on Hasbro for green-lighting this crap, and the screen writers for writing it. The special effects were too good for this movie, and you can't fault the director for shooting an action film. That's what he was hired to do.     \\"G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" falls apart right from the beginning because it does not stay true to the lore and canon of G.I. Joe. And by that, I mean the toy. People have argued violently that you can't take the subject matter seriously because the source material is a toy. But that doesn't stop us from taking other children's properties seriously: Disney has sucessfully translated many children's stories into a billion dollar industry. They did not turn Snow White into a ninja asassin, or Winnie the Pooh into a brain-eating alien.     Source material cannot be dismissed simply because it's based on something marketed to children--and that's exactly what this movie did.     Channing \\"Duke\\" Tatum and Marlon \\"Ripcord\\" Wayans are supposed to be central characters of G.I. Joe. In this film, they are not. (For clarity, I'm saying central to G.I. Joe--they are, in fact, the main characters of the movie.)Sienna \\"The Baroness\\" Miller is supposed to be German. In this film she is not. In this film, she is Duke's ex-girlfriend (American, by the way--even though Ms. Miller is British) who is brain washed into becoming a villian by her crazy brother, Joseph \\"The Doctor/Commander\\" Gordon Levitt. Another actor who should have known better.     And I still want to know why the screen writers came up with the idea of making Zartan whistle \\"For He's A Jolly Good Fellow.\\"  Why? Zartan is supposed to be one ofthe darker, more awesome characters in G.I. Joe. In this movie, he whistles \\"For He's A Jolly Good Fellow.\\"  For no reason.       If you've seen the trailer to this movie, you basically seen the movie. Christopher Eccleston is Destro. Sienna Miller and Storm Shadow get chased by Channing Tatum and Marlon Wayans in Iron Man suits. Storm Shadow shoots the Eiffel Tower with green jello and makes it fall down, which causes the G.I. Joe Army to go under water and fight Destro and The Doctor/Commander in a computer animated super-battle. During the battle, Channing Tatum is chased by a bad guy and he says: \\"I can't shake these guys!\\" Denying us the requisite Star War refrence. Sad.     ((Spoiler Alert))    Christopher Eccleston stands too close to an explosion and gets his face burned. Joseph Gordon Levitt leaps on his neck with a syringe, and Christopher Eccleston almost becomes the Destro we all know and love.    ((End spoiler))    Near the end of the movie, Cobra Commander and Destro are standing in a giant, G.I. Joe cylinder-jail, and Cobra Commander says: \\"This isn't over.\\"  And Duke responds:\\"We'll be waiting.\\" And then he drops them into some kind of holding cell, leaving us with the un-answerable question:    What will they be waiting for? We'll have to wait for the sequel to find out.    The movie ends with our British actor president, Johnathan Pryce, sitting in the oval office whistling \\"For He's A Jolly Good Fellow\\" because he's really Zartan. The credits roll with the super-hot Black Eyed Peas track, \\"Boom Boom Pow.\\"     When you go to a restaruant and order a dish, if you say \\"It's not as good as I though it would be,\\" it means the dish is bad. If you watch a movie expecting it to be bad, and you say \\"it's not as bad as I thought,\\" that means it's still bad.     When I saw the final version of Cobra Commander, I knew this movie was going to be bad...and I was right. I paid only a dollar to see it, and that's about how much it's worth.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is an interesting pitstop in the career of Bill Murray. He is weathered here. Pretty funny, but his melancholy is really restraining the comedy. Which is fine because this film is very somber and simple. At this point in his career, its obvious Bill wants to express his dramatic side and hide his unique and wonderful flair for ocmedy. He radiates dryness, loneliness and discontent in all the right moments. And later pulls out the charm and irreverant irony. Bill deserved an Oscar for this great performance which is romantic, funny and never over-the-top or inapporopriate.    This film is a great companion to Bill's films by director Wes Anderson. It has a definite commercial sensibility. Content-wise, its just a Hollywood film given the \\"indie treatment\\". Its set in an exotic locale. The dialogue is quiet and sparse. The soundtrack is angsty and ironic. And the humor is pretty much mild slapstick given artsy cinematography. But the subject matter of outsiders and bonding with other loners, is perfect for the arthouse crowd. Its a nice dynamic: their alienation in the colorful Japanese culture and living with the miserable lives they've chosen.     Really for Bill Murray fans. This and his Wes Anderson-directed films are okay films on their own. But Bill lifts them up into great vehicles for his talents.
B002VKE0XA|2.0|This is the classic example of the over-hyped movie. All I heard was how \\"scary\\" this movie was and how I would sleep with the lights on for a week after watching it. It wasn't to be. There are a few moments of genius but they fail to scare. Whatever is haunting the couple's house is an uncreative spirit. One night it only manages to move their bedroom door a couple inches. Gasp! Terrifying! If I was the ghost I would place their hands in warm water or drag their bed downstairs so they would wake up in the kitchen! The film spends too much time on miniscule \\"scares\\" with the only legitimate \\"scare\\" coming at the end, it's cool but predictable.<br />You could probably fast forward 40-50 minutes of the movie and not miss anything.<br />Not bad, not good.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|About 3 years ago I purchased this DVD from Amazon for my 4yr old daughter.  She played it so much and eventually scratched it up.  I purchased this for her again (she is now 7).  She is obsessed with it.  I love this movie and the music too!  I would highly recommend it if you are into musicals.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This is a fun crime series with similarities to Bones and Chuck.   Some slightly obvious comedy dialogue, but easily carried by the two leads: the charismatic Nathan Fillion (long-time fan) and Stana Katic (new to me). The supporting cast contain some gems too, especially Molly Quinn playing Castle's daughter Alexis.
B000AP04L0|5.0|There are a lot of funny movies out there, but not many can be said to have so perfectly skewered their subject that they become archetypes. \\"Office Space\\" fits this latter category, doing for the modern, post-1980 workplace  what \\"[[ASIN:B00005O3VC Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]\\" did for the Arthurian legend. That is to say, \\"Office Space\\" has become a part of our common culture, with shared concepts like \\"pieces of flair\\" and \\"Is this good for the COMPANY?\\" being common to the experience not only of cubicle slaves but all of us.    Further, \\"Office Space\\", despite its outrageous plot, is just close enough to the truth of modern corporate America to hit home. Companies do promote incompetents and lay off their most skilled workers, all in the name of short-term quarterly profits. They do treat their employees like drones while rewarding upper management for cheating shareholders. To see this all turned against them goes a long way in explaining the success of \\"Office Space.\\" It's a classic.

B002UZXJA6|5.0|I have just recently been tuned in to Celtic Woman - I have no clue where I've been in the last 5 years as far as music goes.  I saw the first DVD and wanted to go and see them in concert.  After  New Journey and Christmas DVD's....I knew I had to go see them in concert.  But after the loss of Maeve and Orla, I was a little concerned about the \\"new\\" Celtic Woman.  I guess I had nothing to fear.  Lynn and Alex fit right in with the \\"old-timers\\" Chloe and Lisa.  I have watched various You tube videos, a few of which were from this last venue at Powerscourt House and Gardens, but was sorry to see that Lagan Love was the only solo for Lynn and True Colors was chosen for Alex.  I really think Alex's voice was much better shown in her rendition of \\"You'll be in my heart\\" (which was NOT on the DVD or CD) and although Lagan Love shows Lynn's versitility and range, I think they missed out by cutting her version of \\"Carolina Rua\\".  These very talented woman are tremendous asset to the music world.  Unfortunately, at least in Texas, I cannot afford the $150/$250 tickets they are selling for in the 3 venues (Houston, Grand Prairie and San Antonio).  It would've been better to set up the Astrodome or the old Cowboy Stadium and charge less for tix.
B00365YVRO|2.0|When I think about this band's music, I think romance. It's always a great soundtrack to intimacy. Not for this batch of songs. You'll be sleeping alone on the couch with this offering.   Now I can always back a artist/band that is willing explore it's talents, but you can get away with that if your cranking out a cd every or every other year. You can't take a decade layoff, and come back with sounds to play at a funeral. I hope there will be a follow up cd a year from now, something more representative of what this band can do.   I think about the last concert dvd from the band, people were dancing in the aisles and seats, you won't be dancing to this batch of songs.   Maybe this cd was created with the lyrics first, then the music backfilled afterwards. Hopefully the next cd will be music (with all the groove & funk) created first, and Sade's singing & lyrics afterwards.  I must confess that maybe after 10 years I had my hopes & expectations built up to lofty heights, and anything the band submitted was not going to meet those expectations.   Hopefully we won't have this discussion again in 2020.
142313494X|5.0|I got to these books late after having many people recommend them. I'm glad I finally did read them though.<br />Percy Jackson is an absolutely believable young man and we meet him in this book for the first time.He's had trouble all his life in school, strange kinds of trouble but he starts out this book with a teacher he really likes and a close friend. We get to see him find out that he's demi-god, the child of one of the old Olympian Gods and a human. He makes new friends and finds out who his father is. A war in Olympus seems very likely, and it's up to Percy and his friends, Annabeth (another demi-god) and Grover (a satyr) to find out who stole the item of power from Zeus.<br />The characters all have their own voices and personalities, and liberal appearances straight out of Greek myth are everywhere, kept true to the myths but updated to a modern world. The Furies as school teachers? Brilliant!<br />Great for independent readers, interesting enough to keep more challenged readers into it. It's also a great way to introduce kids who haven't had much interest in mythology and how Greek and Roman culture influenced western civilization to those subjects. It may well spark more interest.<br />My number one thing with any juvenile fiction is \\"Was it good enough to keep my daughter interested?\\" She's more interested in cook books and DIY books than fiction. This definitely was. She's read the first three books in the last week and is working on the fourth book now.
B00016ZQXE|5.0|I just heard this album in its entirety for the 1st time in my adult life, though the LP has been sitting in our home since 1977, and I've heard the bulk of it since I was under the age of 10 (My Mom has always had good taste in music). It's not that I didn't want to hear the whole thing, it's just that I wanted to hear it remastered, and the fact that our only record player has been out of commission for well over 10 years. Anywho, it just came in the mail, and I have to say, it's a CLASSIC. I don't know why the Punk Rock scene had a problem w/ this band: Punk was about whatever you wanted to do, however you wanted to do it...there weren't supposed to be any rules. This album is a combination of classic hard rock/metal, punk, power Pop, Funk, Flamenco, and Rockabilly/Jazz. Didn't Punk draw from many of these styles? Also, Queen's subject matter never stuck to the typical sex, drugs, and rock n roll mindset. Their lyrics were poetic and literary. Again, doesn't punk evoke these same traits? Honestly, all kinds of Rock float my boat, and as different as each may be, they're all like distant relatives to me. This album is one of my favorite kinds: The kind of album where each song is different in style and tone from the next. Love albums like that. No stone is left unturned...though, I would've loved a Prog Rock song w/ Gothic, Mythological elements thrown in the mix, for good measure. This is a Queen album, isn't it? Also, what struck me most was how this album never seems to have stages to it: It sounds like a story that just keeps beginning and evolving, then just stops leaving you w/ your thoughts. The diversity of the music probably has a lot to do w/ that. I also love the opposite -- \\"unified theme\\" albums where the songs sound like they're filtering in and through each other, but sometimes that can get tedious after many listenings. The variety of styles and songsmanship on this album really reflects how technically-able these four guys were. As classic 1977 rock as this piece is, it sounds remarkably contemporary (though bands that have an acoustic, real sound don't seem to be THE THING right now on the radiowaves)and actually sounds fresher than much of what's out there now. Familiar territory again...    A word about the sound quality of this Japanese mini-LP remaster (which, by the way, the art reproduction is great and fun to look through...if you lived in the era of LPs, EPs, 8-tracks, and Cassettes, it takes you back...I wonder why more new records aren't presented this way; it's so RETRO! LPs still rock! Though CDs kill best!): I don't know what some of these reviewers are talking about...this remaster is EXCELLENT! The sound quality of this remake has almost the same contemporary clarity that KISS's new SONIC BOOM double album has. I have an excellent SONY Digital CD player w/ accompanying high-quality SONY Digital headphones, and I don't detect any limitations. To me, it sounds like the 1977 master tapes were kept in good shape/or reproduced well in 2001. I'm a little miffed that I hesitated to buy this album over a year ago, because of some of the reviews here. So, if you're on the fence, don't be. Get it! Now, I'm excited to get the companion reissue of THE GAME (1980), the other Queen album of my childhood.    ROCK ON, PEOPLE!

B003102JDM|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />  'A Serious Man' begins with a short 'film-within-a-film\\" illustrating an old Jewish folktale (spoken in Yiddish) about a Dybbuk--a malicious possessing spirit, believed to be the dislocated soul of a dead person. A man comes home and informs his wife that he met an old man in the street who the wife insists died three years ago. Suddenly, there's a knock on the door and the old man is welcomed in by the husband. The wife, however, is convinced that the man is an evil spirit and plunges a knife into his chest. The old man gets up and states he realizes he's not welcome in the home and walks out the door. The folktale serves as an introduction to both the internal and external arc of the story. In both cases, 'tsuris' (a Yiddish word which means troubles) comes to the film's main character, Larry Gopnik, and members of the conservative Jewish community he's part of.<br /><br />  Larry is a physics professor at a local college in the Midwest. He lives with his wife, son and daughter and an oddball uncle who at first seems a bit eccentric but later turns out to be completely dysfunctional. We soon realize that Larry is the embodiment of a modern-day 'Job', illustrating the old adage, 'sometimes bad things happen to good people'. The 'bad things' include one of Larry's Korean students who tries to bribe him with a large amount of cash, hoping that he'll change his grade. The student's father later threatens Larry with a lawsuit for defamation.<br /><br />  Things begin falling apart completely for Larry when his wife announces that she's leaving him for the vapid Sy Ableman, an aging widower who hugs everybody who he comes in contact with. Since Larry is such a pushover, he agrees to Sy and his wife's demand that he move out of the family house and into a local motel. Things get worse when Uncle Arthur is arrested for gambling and later for sodomy. Larry ends up compromising his principles by pocketing the Korean student's bribe money and changing his grade in order to pay a rich lawyer to defend his dysfunctional uncle. Larry is also up for tenure at the college but one of his colleagues on the tenure committee tells him that someone has been sending letters to the committee, impugning his character. After Sy is killed in a car crash, Larry finds out (inadvertently through his wife) that it was Sy who bad-mouthed him to the committee.<br /><br />  Things seem as though they're about to turn for the good for our modern day Job: Son Danny manages to do well at his Bar Mitzvah and Larry finds out that he's on track to get tenure. But at the last minute, Larry gets a call from his physician who wants him to come in immediately and discuss test results--although we don't see the scene with Larry meeting his doctor, the implication is that Larry is about to receive a cancer diagnosis.<br /><br />  The Coen Brothers know how to tell a good story but they have created a group of caricatures, sort of a 'hate letter' to the conservative Jewish community they grew up in. The passive schlep Larry is the only sympathetic character in their entire narrative. Otherwise, every other character (and most of them are Jewish) are either nasty or ineffectual. It's one thing to ridicule a group of people, pointing out their shortcomings--but it must be done with affection and not contempt. Here, the Coen Brothers are always looking at their fellow Jews as if the glass was half empty and never half full.<br /><br />  As Larry's life spirals out of control, his quest for guidance from members of his community falls on deaf ears. The Coens ridicule the community by showing how Larry receives useless advice from a succession of two Rabbis he visits. The first one is a Junior Rabbi who ultimately suggests that Larry passively accept whatever happens to him since we can never know what God has planned for us. The second, Nachtner, an older Rabbi, provides even more useless advice in the form of a parableabout an orthodontist who discovers cryptic letters on a Goy's (non-Jew's) teeth. Larry is exasperated when there is no moral to the story and the Rabbi seems to enjoy reciting the tale simply for its own sake.<br /><br />  Finally, there's a third Rabbi, Marshak, who appears extremely old and feeble. He declines to see Larry but later his son Danny has an obligatory meeting with him after his Bar Mitzvah. Rabbi Marshak had pocketed the transistor radio given to him by a Hebrew School teacher who earlier had confiscated it from Danny who was listening to the radio and not paying attention to anything said in class. The senile Marshak obviously had been listening to the radio earlier and recites a list of popular rock groups (including Jefferson Airplane) before handing the radio back to Danny.<br /><br />  Whereas the member of the community are ineffectual, Larry's family members are a nasty bunch. In addition to his adulterous wife Judith, Larry's daughter Sarah filches money from him to pay for a nose job. Then there's Danny who's addicted to watching 'F Troop' on TV and who must always avoid the neighbor down the street, a youth he too has filched money from. The aforementioned Uncle Arthur won't get a job and ends up in handcuffs for molestation.<br /><br />  As someone who was Bar Mitzvahed in 1966, a year before this story takes place, I well remember my own contempt for some of the rituals and convictions of my co-religionists. But as I grew older, I realized that everyone has their good points and bad. Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers smugly stand above the fray and delude themselves into believing that they're enlightening their audience. In actuality, the Coens remain in an earlier arrested period of development and provide an inaccurate view of the conservative Jewish community they're commenting on.cryptic letters on a Goy's (non-Jew's) teeth.

0385732554|4.0|The Giver is a moderately easy read, yet it gives the reader a deeper grasp on life. Jonas's experience in a uniform society gives the reader a greater appreciation for love, family, and freedom. Lowry has an excellent use of description which places the reader in the same society as Jonas.    Overall, the book is very well written, although written in a very basic manner that makes it more enjoyable for a younger age group.    A four star novel! I recommend it to anyone looking for an interesting read!
006621131X|5.0|I just finished reading Patti Smith's \\"Just Kids.\\" I read it like a glutton. Scarfing it up, page by page, long into the night. Occasionally I would have a glass of wine, or put it down to think back to my own memories of New York from the late '60's +. It's a book filled with possibilities. Patti's mantra, possibilities, \\"one who siezes possibilities,\\" sung in \\"Land.\\" It's a book of drive, vision, ambition, talent, risk, verve, destiny, love, fidelity, friendship.    I had to stop occasionally to wipe away a tear. The New York City of Patti's book doesn't exist anymore. Back then it was city on verge of bankruptcy. Back then you could actually afford to live in Manhattan, have a low pay job, go out at night, and live your dreams. If you spent your food money on art or seeing a band or nursing the two drink minimum you could see greatness every day of the week. New York City is culturally dead now. There is no community, art, music, culture. There is no longer a sea of possibilities. But as \\"Just Kids\\" sanctifies, testifies, signifies, artists will find a way. It's probably out there in the Rust Belt - with dead shells of former factories - or in the Heartland - or somewhere in America with foreclosing homes and decay - or some other country - somewhere - it's happening. Artists find a way because they can't help themselves. They are ornery and can't be contained. That's the message in \\"Just Kids,\\" have a dream, make an oath, keep it real, do it. Damn the torpedos! Full speed ahead!    But back then, back in the day, the Dead Zone was New York City. We spilled out of Jersey, Long Island, BBQ Bridge & Tunnel crowd, who could no longer be contained. I first saw Patti on WOR on a Sunday night talking about graffiti subway cars as Jackson Pollack. I have \\"Seventh Heaven\\" and \\"Witt\\" with her evaporating signitures, \\"Ha Ha Houdini\\" in hand-minted offset typeface. She was the one with the true grit to climb out of the audience and get up there and do it.     Robert Mapplethorpe I came to appreciate. It took me a while to warm to him. It took me a while to warm to him in \\"Just Kids.\\" Patti makes a complex man human, and it's a loving portrait of an artist often sensationalized. Patti keeps at it until you see him through her eyes. As Sam Shepard paraphrased, his dream wasn't my dream. But it's a dream she knew well, and she uses all her talent to make it real for us.    In \\"Just Kids,\\" Patti and Robert's finding one another thru pure happenstance, is the stuff of kismet. Their support and love for one another is palpable. There is new information about both of them in this book that nobody but they could possibly know. This, if nothing else, makes this book necessary and vital.     Nothing I've read about either Patti and Robert comes close to this book. I thought I'd read, heard, knew, everything about Patti Smith. We have mutual friends. I was at the same places, at the same time, as she. Robert Mapplethorpe is equally well documented. This is the stuff of the Inner Sanctum.     God, what a testiment. This is a great gift. Robert would be proud. He'd say, \\"Patti, no!\\" Thank you.

0446567337|5.0|Wow, really a great book.  I had so much difficulty putting it down.  I found it so frustrating that John kept leaving Savannah despite his true love for her.  It brought me back to memories of myself when I was in high school and college.  It made me think of falling in love and I had vivid memories of how I fell in love with my wife.  While reading this book I kept looking over at my wife and I was thankful I did not have those horrible, \\"miss you\\" feelings that I once had when I was younger.    I could not stop reading the book only because I wanted John to end up with Savannah and spend the rest of his life with her.  I was so SHOCKED that he kept re-enlisting and even more surprised when I found out Savannah married Tim. I found myself with some heartache at the end of this book.  I would love to re-write the ending a completely different way, with Savannah always waiting for John and him not re-enlisting over and over.      A great book, but it was a difficult ending for me
B00005B534|5.0|An exceptional album, which places \\"Adagio\\" as equals among guitar demi-Gods. I would say, that this band blends symphonic metal with progressive rock. The technique is equal and even higher than that of guitar virtuoso, reminds the best moments of Blackmore and Malmsteen. But composing of \\"Adagio\\" is outstanding, based on more sofisticated and refined tradition (France doesn't need to borrow anything - Saint-Preux \\"To Be Or Not\\")and getting inspired directly by baroque music. A real masterpiece of great talent and educated taste. Deserves 6 stars. As a living fossil (born more than 50 years ago), I am really impressed and pleased. Bonne chance and meilleurs voeux!
B002YIHO7I|2.0|Like others who have posted, I bought this CD the moment I laid eyes on it in the store.  Sade is the only artist whose music I would purchase without a preview.  Sadly, it's a big disappointment.  I like the first 2 tracks, but Babyfather is the first Sade song I can honestly say that I hate.  \\"Your daddy knows your a flame\\"?  What does that even mean?  And you would think I would have figured it out since it's repeated about 600 times in that song.  Ugh, how awful.  And then the last few tracks are just flat out boring and all sound the same.  For any other artist, I would have given it 1 star, but the word \\"Sade\\" earned it another, I love her.  It just can't hold a candle to her past work, plain and simple.  There isn't one song on this CD that is half as good as \\"Somebody already broke my heart\\".  I plan to copy the first 2 songs onto my iPod, and then never listen to this CD again.  Please try again though, Sade Adu.
0691142165|1.0|Publisher's choice of kindle pricing is inappropriate.  I won't buy the kindle version, hard-cover, or paperback version of a book when the publisher's are playing such games.    Reviewers have noted the heavy use of quantitative analysis, tables and figures.  My reading experience has been less than satisfying with other similarly written kindle editions.  Amazon/Kindle should consider a programing \\"patch\\" that could enhance the readability of charts, tables and figures.    I'm off to my local library.  Borrow the book for free.

Back when it came out in 2004 i felt as if this was an eye opener, when i saw that it was on blu ray, i had to hop on that! typically blurays quality is so good, sometimes it feels too animated, but the graphics were pretty cool and i loved the quality! i would recommend to other people to watch!
0763635383|2.0|I was given this book when my eldest daughter was 14 months. The first time we read it, she broke into tears. After this happened again, we put the book away. Last week, my 18 month old read this book at a play group and started crying as well. This is unusual behavior for my otherwise strong girls. It just was not appropriate for their age. It is odd that a board book is recommended for 4 - 8 year olds.

076780421X|5.0|I was expecting this to be a mindless romantic comedy that would be fun to mock but it was really very good. Salma Hayek elevated the situation comedy hijinks to a much higher level with her portrayal of Isabel Fuentes--plus she is muy caliente. She flirts with Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry), ostensibly to cut in line for the bathroom in a Las Vegas restaurant, and we learn that she is the youngest child in a family with five older brothers--a little headstrong, but down to earth, if a bit superstitious.<br /><br />Whitman is a typical Chandler Bing character, clever but self deprecating in his humor, and at least he has a cool job, as he is in Las Vegas to build and manage a night club. The name \\"Whitman,\\" just one letter away from Whiteman, should be a tip off that these fools are rushing in to a cultural clash of epic proportions, and that is exactly what happens when their one night stand results in pregnancy. The headstrong Isabel, who sneaked away the morning after, comes back to inform him that she is going to keep the child herself. She only wants him to meet her family so that afterwards, when they ask her who the father was, she can tell them that they already met him. She assumes that they will disapprove of him right off the bat, and so later they won't pressure her to marry him.<br /><br />Alex doesn't make such a great impression, but he keeps trying his best as he has fallen for the lovely senorita. The culture clash plays out against the backdrop of Las Vegas, but also the desert that Isabel and her familia love. You get the bright lights, big city with a Rat Pack soundtrack with Dean Martin; Viva Las Vegas and other tunes from Elvis; and Dankeshan from Wayne Newton; along with sizzling Latin sounds from Mariachi music to salsa for the desert scenes. Ole! It's the best of both worlds!<br /><br />--------------<br />Isabel Fuentes: [in labor, screaming at Alex] I hate you! I hate you!

B0030BYWKK|4.0|I purchased this CD last week. I like it. It has remnants of influences from the late sixties early seventies Folk Rock era. Sits well alongside Pentangle, Tir Na Nog, Dando Shaft, Forest, John Michael Talbot and Phil Keaggy. The first track Acts Of Man sets the mood for the whole disc. This is a mostly acoustic collection of 11 songs. Two of the songs veer into more of an electric hard rock flavor that kind of breaks the moody trance. Though the Bass guitar and drums are performed excellently I think the cd would have been much better with the bass sub low turned down in volume it tends to overpower the organic sound the music exudes. The rock style drums would have been better should they have opted for an organic percussion sound like a celtic bodhran and middle eastern dumbeks and darbukas and other percussion instruments of the like. The bass and drums are just a bit too sub-low and rock flavored for the very pristine and mystical folk music contained here, so I just kill the bass EQ on my stereo to satisfy my personal preference for this cd. Aside from my what if's, this is a very good cd of folk rock music.

B000QUUD60|5.0|\\"Elvis: That's The Way It Is\\" captures King Presley at an interesting cross-roads in his career. With his true talents largely wasted after too  many years in Hollywood, Elvis found himself usurped as the \\"King Of Rock and Roll\\" by the likes of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones. This documentary, filmed in the summer of 1970 as he prepared for an engagement at the International Hotel in Las Vegas, finds Elvis ready and in prime condition to reclaim his throne! The documentary shows him at age 35, fit and trim, and having a lot of fun! To see Elvis having fun-- that in itself is a joy!<br />  Elvis had a fine sense of muscianship and his craft. He expected a lot from the people he worked with; and he knew exactly how to get the best out of everybody. It is obvious here that Elvis loved working with his band and back-up singers; and they loved working with him. Elvis gave criticism in a gentle, funny way. When his band has  difficulty  with the middle section of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", Elvis comments, \\"If it goes that way, it goes that way, but we don't have to emphasize it.\\"<br />The concert footage itself proves that Elvis may very well have been the hardest working man in  show-business. It also proves that Elvis had \\"it\\"-- that indefinable, often indescrible X-Factor (or in his case, factors) that mark the difference between an entertainer and a superstar. Elvis was a superstar with a capital \\"S\\"-- possessing a potent combination of charisma, sex appeal, musicianship and showmanship. Elvis' charisma, in particular, fairly burns up the stage.<br />  Elvis does all he can to please his audience. During a lengthy rendition of \\"Love Me Tender,\\" he goes out into the audience, kissing as many women, and shaking hands with as many men, as possible. He sings a Greatest Hits Medley largely for laughs (changing lyrics to \\"forget about the past, before I kick your a##\\"). Mid-way through the concert, Elvis is just getting started, delivering mighty renditions of \\"In The Ghetto,\\" \\"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\\" and \\"Polk Salad Annie.\\"  His extended, super-charged and super-sweaty rendition of \\"Suspicious Minds\\" will likely leave viewers as exhausted as Elvis at the end.<br />  As the end credits roll, we see Elvis greeting fellow celebrities after the performance. Sammy Davis, Jr., clearly in awe, remarks, \\"Man, you reveed up and you never stopped!\\" When he is congratulated on a wonderful show, Elvis modestly replies, \\"Well, it was a sweaty show.\\"<br />  The DVD Special Edition includes two versions, but stick with the more recent Restored Edition and skip the original 1970 theatrical version. The 1970 theatrical version has testimonials from fans that are unnecessary. The Restored Version  has more footage of Elvis in action. \\"Elvis: That's The Way It Is\\" is the way Elvis should always be remembered!o,\\" \\"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\\" and \\"Polk Salad Annie.\\"  His extended, super-charged and super-sweaty rendition of \\"Suspicious Minds\\" will likely leave viewers as exhausted as Elvis at the end.

B00002Z88D|5.0|I have this on CD I Found a long time ago, i'm not exactly a Metallica fan, I like Megadeth better, but this concert is amazing. The sound is perfect, Kirk Hammett's singing is excellent. Everyone is sounding their best. The guitars are toned down nicely.   I don't even like the Enter Sandman song but I love the version on this album.   I have this on DVD too because I liked it so much. This is possibly one of the best (if not the best) Metallica concerts out there.
0312570740|5.0|This book tells, in plain language the incredible story of Marc Rich. Author Daniel Ammann takes very complicated business and legal issues and makes them clear and interesting.  The story flows nicely. It is a \\"can't put it down\\" book.<br /><br />When you're finished, you sympathize with Rich. Marc Rich (speaking through Ammann's text) is convincing in his contention that he's been over-prosecuted and demonized beyond his alleged crimes. Many believe he is the ultimate international demon, but the reasons for his notoriety are not clear to the general public. After he paid his company's back taxes plus fees, US prosecutors, who were building name recognition to go on to more powerful or lucrative careers, pressed for a criminal conviction.  Significant resources were used in building this case and hunting him down. Bill Clinton could certainly sympathize with the harassment factor.<br /><br />Rich is less convincing in justifying his dealing with the world's most oppressive governments. While saying these deals are merely business, he claims that in bringing commerce to these sad and poor countries he has made life better there.  Like the Nicholas Cage character in [[ASIN:B000EWBKK8 Lord of War [Blu-ray]]], he believes \\"This is not our war.\\"  I believe he made life better for the dictators and their henchmen at the top, thereby retarding the development of better societies.<br /><br />Rich showed confidence in his story by giving Ammann unprededented access to people and records and ceding him full editorial and content control. Ammann uses his access well and covers Rich's family, his rise, his methods and lifestyle. Rich's terse answers in the interview at the end show wisdom and experience. To me, his flaw is that he believes that everything legal is moral.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in this person and topic.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|Anyone who has ever complained about big budget movies being predictable, cliche-ridden, shallow, pandering, stupid, style-over-substance, etc. ect. should see this movie.  I knew I was in for something special when the movie began in 18th century France and people looked unhealthy, filthy, & stench-ridden.  Although I must note that they did not get the teeth right.  Up until last century, oral health for the majority of the population was of little concern.  By in large, people's gums were diseases, and their teeth ugly, and their breath beyond foul.  Which reminds me to remind you to floss (only approx 25% of people in N.America do), and find out how to do it right.<br /><br />The story itself possesses fantastical elements, and there are anachronisms, so this isn't just an attempt at a literal recreation of the 18th century France.  So don't think that the movie is going to be one long dreary stench-fest.  Rather it is like an adult version of a Grimms's story, or maybe Hans Christian Anderson.  I would advise against reading any reviews, because this movie is best approached cold, and especially on Amazon where the do not have a SPOILER policy.  So if you want something different than the latest Hollywood romcom or special effects screen vomit, check this one out.<br /><br />Oh and if you have a thing for real Redheads like me, you've got to see Karoline Herfurth in this one.  And she is a real redhead although they did color her hair to make it more visually striking.  Unfortunately, shes the only real red in the movie.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|Wow.  Every frame of this film is desinged with one aim, to manipulate the audience.  And if your into consensual mind-F, then you'll really like this movie.  Me, when I see a heavy handed morality tale that seeks to take my mind and turn it into play-dough, I bristle.<br /><br />Cameron lost me when the Indians...I mean Natives...I mean Navi were first shown.  With their huge cute eyes that subconsciously elicit certain responses in humans.  The first response to this neotenous trait is the same response people get when looking at babies.  You know sympathy, an urge to care for them, and yes even love.  The second characteristis is restricted to men (and alot of men find the Navii protaganist to be sexy).  Men prefere women with big eyes because it signals a high level of estrogen which makes getting pregnant easier.  So big eyes are a very effective means of manipulation.  As an aside, magazines and advertisers almost always increase the size of the eyes of women on their covers, and often times babies too with photoshop/cgi.  And hey, lets have the Navvi look almost exactly like humans, and lets have some of them speak perfect English...yeah real they real alien.<br /><br />Then Cameron wheels out the bad guys: the psychopathic corporation and the psycopathic military. Oh and lets not forget the evils of technology.  No moral ambiguities here, thats for sure.  It's the ugly techno-baby-killers vs the big-eyed-beautiful-good-people.  You know, as an aside, pre-Columbian cultures were just a vicious and ruthless as the Euros.  And no they didn't live in harmony with the environment.  [[ASIN:1400032059 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus]].  And the dislocation of the Natives was no different than what had been happening in human history since time immemorial.  The only difference was that the euro settlers did not wipe them out or enslave them,  and they tried to make it legal buy paying them money.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie works only if your mind is like plastacine.<br /><br />Finally, the revolutionary-ness of this film has been way overstated.  CGI worlds?  How about The Phantom Menace from 1999.  3-D, crickey 3-d movies have been spreading like a rash for the last 5 years.  And the 3-d in this movies suffers from what all 3-d movies suffer from.  First, the bluring of rapid movement, the loss of brightness as each eye is only recieving 50% of the light it would have in a 2-D screening which destroys lighting nuance and detail, and finally the loss of the ability to take in the whole frame.  You have to focus on a particular plane when watching 3-d, which makes the rest of the image out of focus.  Yes, I will admit that this movie and Lovely Bones (released at around the same time) make use of 3-d cgi more extensively than other movies, but realistic 3-d cgi is not new nor revolutionary.<br /><br />Side note: 3-d films are not actually 3 dimensional.  They use the same stereoscopic technique that was invented in the mid 19th century.e.     Finally, the revolutionary-ness of this film has been way overstated.  CGI worlds?

0307341550|4.0|First Line: My sweater was new, stinging red and ugly.<br /><br />Not all that long ago Camille Preaker was a patient in a psychiatric hospital. Now she's a reporter for a second-rate Chicago newspaper. Her first assignment? To go back home to Wind Gap, Missouri, to cover the murders of two young girls.<br /><br />Although the police think that the killer is a transient, Camille believes a local is responsible. As she interviews old acquaintances and newcomers, she begins reliving her childhood and uncovering long-buried secrets in her family.<br /><br />This was a very uncomfortable book for me to read. Although I try my best not to give away plot points, this book has been out for about four years, and what I'm about to say is nothing that can't be found in any review at Amazon. The razor blade on the cover of Sharp Objects isn't there merely for decoration. The reason why Camille was in a psychiatric hospital is because she's a cutter. Reading about Camille's preference for self-harm not only gave me the creeps, it strongly reminded me of my own battles with severe depression. (In my own case, I was in so much mental pain that picturing chopping off my hand with a meat cleaver was seductive, and I actually believed that it would feel good.) Although I'm well past that, the memories are very easily brought to the surface.<br /><br />As I met the members of Camille's family, I wanted to drag her out of that house and never let her return. Mental illness had made that place a dead zone, my skin was itching fiercely, and I found the pages more and more difficult to turn.<br /><br />My strong reactions may give you the impression that the book is poorly written. It is not. On the contrary-- to produce such strong emotions in me, I would say that it's very well written. The only real weakness I found in Sharp Objects was the fact that Flynn's attempts at misdirection did not work with me. Early on I'd homed in on the murderer like a guided missile, and Flynn could not shake me.<br /><br />After turning the last page, I felt as though I needed a stiff drink or a strong tranquilizer. I haven't felt that way in a very long time. If Flynn's second novel, Dark Places, is anything like her first, I'm not at all sure that I'll read it. I think my grandfather would call that a back-handed compliment!, I felt as though I needed a stiff drink or a strong tranquilizer. I haven't felt that way in a very long time. If Flynn's second novel, Dark Places, is anything like her first, I'm not at all sure that I'll read it. I think my grandfather would call that a back-handed compliment!
B001DDBCUA|2.0|I was HBO deprived so I never watched the show when it came out. Watched some of the episodes in syndication, and I thought was OK for 1/2 hour episodes.  The episodes changed each time, but this movie way too shallow for 2 hours. I love NYC even though only visited on business. The show did have many episodes in cool locations around NYC. The movie disappointing in that as well.    If you want a movie with more depth, great shots of NYC... get Confession of a Shop-a-Holic, or the original Sex series.    Kim Cartall was great in the Ice Princess ! She needs to dump the city and move forward! Same as the other actresses whom I respect in other roles.
B000002HH9|5.0|This album gets a lot of flack from hardcore Cure fans as being \\"disappointing.\\" As someone relatively young and disengaged from the chronology and expectations of the Cure, I find it to be their strongest and most solid album which features some of their most vulnerable, mature, and adventurous songs Smith has written.    Music-wise, I would describe the album as follows: First track is a heavy and dark slow-burner, probably was a mistake to make this the first track because it is the most unlike the rest of the songs on the album. People probably hear it first and think \\"Sweet, Disintegration part II!\\" The rest of the album consists of some of the most achingly beautiful and almost-acoustic tracks the Cure have recorded. \\"This is a Lie\\", \\"Jupiter Crash\\", \\"Treasure\\", and \\"Numb\\" are pensive masterpieces with \\"lennon-esque\\" poetic lyrics and mature songwriting. Some of the most naked and emotionally heavy works Robert Smith has penned. Many of the songs feature saucy-brass instrumentations and there are even some of your more ecstatic \\"poppy\\" Cure songs such as \\"Strange Attraction\\", \\"Return\\", and \\"Mint Car.\\"     Overall, I would think this album has a little bit of something for everyone. However, if you're looking for the dark, dense, and depressing sounding Cure, I would just go back and listen to Disintegration, Bloodflowers, or Pornography. Overall, I think this is a solid masterpiece that features both familiar and unfamiliar elements of the Cure.

They can't all be huge hits and perfectly entertaining!<br /> Lyrically and musically ( guitar), these songs are very under par for him. Mostly extremely limited, simple ( repetitive, etc..) lyrics, and rather childish-like tunes compared with his actual range and abilities as obviously seen/heard in other albums and songs.  :( Pretty disappointing.<br /><br /> I still love him.

B002VKE0XA|1.0|Ooooooooo scariest movie ever.  Please.  I've taken bowel movements scarier than this movie.  Mercifully I don't own it, and didn't even have to spend money to watch it as a friend had rented it.  I would have rather had body parts amputated without anesthesia.  Oh no, random noises!  Scary.  A girl standing by her bed!  Even scarier!  Her sleepwalking!  That was the scariest part of the movie.  I feel sorry for anyone who actually spent money to watch this.  I feel even sorrier for those of us who sat through this slop.  I want my time back.  I was cheated.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|The cover of this DVD does a terrible job of preparing the viewers for what they're about to witness.  The cover is bright, cheery and green:  exactly what the movie is not.  People who come into this expected a follow-up to the Judy Garland film, complete with song and dance numbers, are going to be severely disappointed.  And possibly a little traumatized.  Nonetheless, this is a very good movie...just not the sort of thing most people envision when they think about Oz.    Our story begins with Dorothy--an actual child this time, not a teenager like Judy Garland--still obsessing over the \\"imaginary\\" world of Oz.  She's carted off to a mental asylum by her concerned but misguided aunt and uncle, where she comes within a hairsbreadth of being subjected to primitive electroshock therapy from a creepy-looking machine.  The opening scenes are filled with disturbing, dreary images of a prison-like mental asylum run by a deranged doctor...and this pretty much sets the tone for the entire movie.  Even Dorothy's escape into Oz doesn't brighten her life much, as she's confronted with an almost post-apocalyptic vision of a desolate world with a run-down Yellow Brick Road and an empty city.  Her friends are nowhere to be found.    The villains in this movie are genuinely scary.  Mombi collects severed heads and switches them with her own.  The Nome King is a rock-monster who swallows people whole.  Despite all this darkness, however, there are moments of poignant sweetness in Dorothy's friendships with Jack, Tiktok, and the Gump.  And Belinda the talking chicken provides some welcome bits of comic relief without descending too far into silliness.    I remember seeing this movie as a small child and being thoroughly freaked out by it, but the images and characters stayed with me over the years.  Seeing it again as an adult, I was able to appreciate it as a unique artistic vision.  Though it's really not for small children, it's still a remarkable story in its own right.  It will inevitably be compared to the original Oz movie and expected to \\"follow in its footsteps,\\" but as the movie isn't intended as a direct sequel, such comparisons aren't really fair.    Definitely worth a watch.  Just keep an open mind.

While following up the Da Vinci Code with another Robert Langdon thriller must have been a daunting prospect, I believe that Dan Brown has done so magnificently.

Thank you Mr. Brown for such a wonderful and inspiring read!
0061703257|5.0|I'm a reader that hasn't read many detective noir novels.  Late last summer I saw the original trailer for the movie version of SHUTTER ISLAND and, as I often do with movies I discover that are based on books, I went out and purchased a copy of the novel by Dennis Lehane to read.  It was an absolute page turner.  I was quite busy when I started reading the book, but I finished it in a few days time.<br /><br />The story revolves around U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels.  Daniels and his partner, Chuck Aule, are sent to Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane on Shutter Island to investigate the disappearance of a female patient.  Upon landing upon the island it doesn't take Teddy and Chuck very long to realize that nothing on the island is at all what it appears to be.  Teddy finds secret codes all around the island, the inmates talk of bizarre medical experiments happening in the light house, and one of the doctors at the hospital is suspected of being a Nazi who was involved in experimenting on captured Jews.  To make matters worse a hurricane is barreling toward the island and Teddy and Chuck are forced to extend their visit longer than planned.<br /><br />I really enjoyed SHUTTER ISLAND.  I've tried to avoid Lehane's work after seeing MYSTIC RIVER, a movie that I abhorred.  I'm glad I gave SHUTTER ISLAND a chance.  The characters are real and vivid and as disorienting the situation they find themselves, their actions and the story as a whole is quite believable.<br /><br />The story does have a twist and the ending is really quite painful and sad.  Perhaps it's because I haven't read many stories in the same vein but I was unable to figure out the master plan.  While reading, I kept re-reading the prologue and trying to figure out exactly how it fit into the overall story.  There are clues there, but I was unable to decipher them.<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed SHUTTER ISLAND. It was one of the best books I read in 2009.

On his way to winning it all, he ignores the advice of his pit crew and blows his tires near the finish line. A photo-finish shows a 3-way tie and sets the stage for the big race. A wrong turn on his way to California lands him in hot water at Radiator Springs. Sentenced to fix the road he destroyed in this old and dilapidated town something happens. The self-centered racing stud starts to care about something more than himself.<br /><br />This a great movie for kids and adults. The story is wonderful as are the lessons to be learned. I am extremely partial to this film because it was my little boy's 1st favorite movie! Disney/Pixar do it again!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: DAZZLING! The details on Blu-Ray are outageous. The picture is tremendous, the reflections and details on the cars are amazing! The sound wasn't what I expected but was fine. All the special features are carried over to HD and their are additional Blu-Ray features added! FINAL VERDICT: DON'T LOSE THIS RACE! UPGRADE, ABSOLUTELY! BUY IT!
B00004XQ8H|5.0|This Decca Legends issue offers exactly the same programme as the newly remastered Naxos disc. There is also a super-bargain Regis, which includes an extra aria from \\"Ariadne auf Naxos\\" (\\"Ein Sch&ouml;nes war\\") conducted live in 1954 by B&ouml;hm and also substitutes a live performance of the final scene from \\"Capriccio\\", conducted in 1953 by Johannes den Hertog. The bonus \\"Ariadne\\" excerpt and the extra frisson and immediacy derived from the live \\"Capriccio\\", in combination with the low price, should make the Regis an attractive alternative; unfortunately their clumsy remastering from LPs has resulted in too much obtrusive \\"wow and swoosh\\" to make it wholly recommendable - yet the Regis disc retains its value for the animation of that live \\"Capriccio\\" performance and the fact that despite its rough edgy sound and prominent harps, it retains upper frequencies lost in the fuller, richer sound of both the Decca and the Naxos versions. Previous reviewers have wondered whether Decca's re-engineering for the Legends series has not removed too many of those upper frequencies; I can say only that to my ears, the singers have been brought forward and the orchestra has more presence; both welcome improvements, despite the very slightly duller, more muffled quality.<br /><br />Much has already been written about the creamy beauty of Lisa della Casa's voice, especially in Strauss. The composer called her his ideal Arabella and there is ample evidence for his enthusiasm in these excerpts. There is nothing overt or over-emotive about her singing; the voice soars effortlessly heavenwards, surprising the listener with its power despite its essentially lyric quality.  In addition to radiant tone and innate musicality, della Casa had the indefinable ability to touch the heart of both the listener and the character she embodies.<br /><br />Della Casa here sings the \\"Four Last Songs\\" in the order preferred by the composer, although as a modern listener I would need some convincing that this sequence is really artistically preferable. Leaving that aside, it is refreshing to hear these songs sung so straightforwardly; the angelic radiance of her tone, the broad, arcing phrasing on a long breath and the refusal to swoon create spirituality without a trace of sentimentality. First-time listeners might be taken aback by the complementary directness of B&ouml;hm's brisk accompaniment; there is little use of ritardando or the courting of stasis so common in more reverential readings - but it suits della Casa's mode perfectly and her interpretation forms a welcome counterpoint to the more indulgent, Romanticised versions we have become used to. Some find her cool in these songs; I suggest that they are not listening properly.<br /><br />We are then treated to her interpretations of three great Straussian ladies and can again admire the economy with which she portrays their varied emotions. She is equally convincing and adorable in all three rôles, from the ironic playfulness of the Countess, to the wistfulness of Arabella, to the naïve piety of Ariadne - and in glorious voice throughout; the trenchancy of her low A flat on \\"Totenreich\\" immediately followed by a ringing B flat on \\"Hermes\\" is testament to a voice in prime condition throughout its two registers. Furthermore, this anthology comprises some of the most delicate, moving and sensuous music Strauss ever wrote; the ideal vehicle for such a voice to float and soar in. Is there a more luscious tune in opera than the long-breathed melody which launches Arabella's \\"Aber der Richtige\\"? Not when sung as it is here by della Casa, I submit - especially when Gueden answers her with Zdenka's dreamy rejoinder and the two voices intertwine. If I have any criticism at all, it is to cavil about della Casa's occasional use of a half-aspirate to change pitch in the upper reaches of her voice, but otherwise it is voice as close to perfection as one could encounter. She is happily supported by three great Viennaregulars in Hilde Gueden, Paul Schoeffler and Alfred Poell, all perfectly in character and vocally impressive.<br /><br />For me, however, the centrepiece of this programme is the closing scene from \\"Capriccio\\". As much as I love Gundula Janowitz and Ren&eacute;e Fleming in this music, della Casa is the supreme aristocrat in this role, singing with a purity, charm and unfeigned sincerity which are utterly irresistible.<br /><br />And all the while, we can enjoy the luxury of the finest orchestra possible in this music. The Vienna Philharmonic provides a velvet cushion of sound, utterly at ease in Strauss's idiom. Despite the mono sound, the \\"Moonlight\\" music has rarely sounded more magical.<br /><br />While I still appreciate the added sonority of a modern stereo recording such as that given to Fleming in her marvellous disc of Strauss bon-bons with Susan Graham and Barbara Bonney, I would never want to be without this magnificent souvenir of perhaps the greatest Strauss soprano ever. Similarly, while treasurable recordings of the \\"Four Last Songs\\" are legion, every devotee should make room on the shelves for this one, no matter how many versions he owns.oeffler and Alfred Poell, all perfectly in character and vocally impressive.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|Want to download vinyl hits to your MP3 player or burn a CD?  This could be the turntable for you.  It is NOT a turntable for hardcore audiophiles (not enough bells and whistles that cost an arm and leg) but for us with a motherload of vinyl hits in the basement we have no way of enjoying, this turntable is a very good solution.<br /><br />There are 2 problems with the unit:  1. Written instructions and Sony's Audio Studio LE CD that accompanies the turntable are difficult to understand and frustrating to use.  I'm no computer nerd but not a neophyte either.  For example: If you have the turntable USB is plugged into computer you cannot hear the soundtrack, but I could not find this anywhere in the instructions. Unplug it from the puter and \\"Voila\\" beautiful sound from your old vinyl via the computer recording. This leads to problem 2,you cannot simultaneously listen to vinyl as you record it.<br /><br />That said, it is a very good unit with PC computer software (included)system to download vinyls into the computer making you able to burn CDs, download to MP3 players or listen to on your computer system (as long as it has speakers).  Once I caught onto the turntable operation (see the 2 problems listed above) my husband and I were very pleased to find the sound quality crisp whether it was Beethoven or the Beatles. The recorded tunes have no hiccups or scratchy, hissing sounds(thanks to the software and a cleaning kit with the record liquid cleaner and brush purchased at the same time). The turntable has multiple speeds (33 1/3 and 45 RPMs, alas no 78 RPM). It is very easy to hook up to your computer via a USB line and port and into the AUX ports on the back of my independent cd/stereo system.  Also has an automatic arm which is convenient when you are recording an album to the computer. After years of \\"Vinyl Withdraw\\" it is great to listen to some old songs that are not available in other formats. I simply refuse to incur the cost of duplicating our vinyl collection with the purchase of the identical cd's or MP3 downloads (remember not all vinyl classic music is available on MP3, example the Beatles), this turntable solves that problem.  The turntable's price didn't break the bank either, which is a major plus.<br /><br />My husband and I liked the idea of updating and broadening our listening pleasure, so Santa gave us \\"his and hers\\" Sony Walkman MP3 players with the planned purchase of a turntable with USB to make our vinyl collection available again. This one allows us to do so. I also highly recommend our MP3 players [[ASIN:B002IPHA1W Sony Walkman NWZS545BLK 16 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)]]. Savvy Santa was smart enough to purchase a red one for me and black for him so we can easily tell the twins apart.<br /><br />The biggest plus was the smile on my husband's face when tore open this wedding anniversary gift and knew he could listen to his vinyl records again.

B001CZVVWI|5.0|I have listened to this and other operas with 5.1/7.1 surround sound for about 5 years now and I consider this Blu Ray a reference recording.<br />If you have 6 decent loudspeakers set up properly, you will feel you are at the performance. The soundstage is very wide and curved, for instance you will hear the flutes and clarinets halfway between the left front and the left surround speakers, yet still separated from each other. All instruments are clearly located and you feel like sitting in the middle seat of row 4.<br />The voices are all recorded clear as a bell and I don't think you can record them any better. They move along the stage when the singers are moving and don't come only from the center channel. I like the voices and the acting of all the principals, Spagnoli is a fine Figaro and Mayo a fine Rosina. The orchestra and the chorus are not too loud or overpowering during loud passages.  Overall, outstanding sound and I guess the 24 bit sampling has something to do with it.<br />Picture is sharp and the video direction is also fine.<br />The production has some quirks, as others have pointed out, but as far as audio is concerned, you won't be disappointed.<br />Few recordings are as good as this one. My hat is off to Andy Rose (whom I don't know), who is listed responsible for Stereo and Surround Sound.<br />I wished all opera recordings sounded that good.

B002NPCSJG|5.0|This is classic space opera in the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein (which is by no means a bad thing). John Perry is an interesting and engaging character. He is sharp, sarcastic and willing to try something very new. At age 75 and knowing that he doesn't want to get older, he enlists in the Colonial Defense Force not knowing what is in store for him. No one on Earth has ever met anyone from the CDF. John is changed and becomes a soldier. He manages to survive numerous battles when 3/4 of his fellow recruits do not and he is promoted from Private to Captain in a very short time.<br /><br />What is the male equivalent of a Mary-Sue story? This would seem to qualify if only because John always seems to be in the right place at the right time. He lost his beloved wife before they could both enlist. Yet he is rescued from a massacre by someone wearing her body. He comes up with a unique firing solution that turns a battle from defeat to a victory. He manages to find the plans for a secret advanced weapon in the middle of a battle. There are probably more examples too.<br /><br />I very much enjoyed this book and am glad that the sequels -- The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony -- are sitting in my TBR stack too. The book was filled with adventure, interesting situations and characters, and even love.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I am 31 and I grew up LOVING Disney movies. My kids (4 1/2 and 2 1/2) love em as well. I own all of the major titles and have acquired a very large collection of Disney soundtrack music as well. I was pumped to take my 4 1/2 year old to see a 2D original style Disney film or at least a good excuse to pay theater prices to see it. Unfortunately it just was not good. The story was okay but the characters were forgettable and what's worse is that there weren't ANY good songs! Every good Disney film has a catchy, memorable, or fun song (or several of them in most of the films). This movie definitely did not. I will buy it just because I'm such a fan, but I'll leave it up to the kids to watch it because I was flat out bored with it. Bummer..........<br />Well, my kids are now 7 and 5 respectively and I have watched this film probably 6-7 times and I love it. My kids love it too.

0099511878|5.0|Gothic romances were all the rage in the late 1700s and early 1800s -- and rather than the usual straight comedies of manners, Jane Austen once wrote a mellow satire of the very mockable genre. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a clever and slightly tongue-in-cheek little novel about a girl who needs to learn the difference between fantasy and reality... and yes, there's some love tangles and deceptions too.<br /><br />Catherine Morland is an innocent young country girl with a love of gothic romances, and has lives an unremarkably life in a country parish. But then the wealthy Allens invite her to Bath during their vacation there, and of course she accepts -- and through balls and old acquaintances, she becomes friends with two pairs of siblings. One is the Thorpes, the uncouth dandy John and his manipulative sister Isabella, and the more mysterious Tilneys, the charming Henry and sweet Eleanor.<br /><br />When the Tilneys decide to leave Bath, Catherine is invited with them, to the vast stone manorhouse of Northanger Abbey -- which is as gloomy, eerie and remote as her gothic-loving heart could wish for. What's more, she believes that there are dangerous secrets in Northanger Abbey, related to the suspicious death of the late Mrs. Tilney. But Catherine has some lessons to learn about reality and fantasy: that everyday world is not nearly as melodramatic and twisted as her novels, and that it has its own dangers and deceptions.<br /><br />Unlike all the other books Austen wrote, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a careful balance of two different styles -- a parody of all the lurid excesses of classic gothic novels (she even lists a bunch of real-life gothic novels!), and it's a subtle coming-of-age tale about a young girl who needs to figure out the difference between reality and fantasy. There's big spooky manors, sinister noblemen, mysterious deaths... you do the math.<br /><br />And Austen clearly had a lot of fun with this book, enhancing her usual formal style with a bit of satirical melodrama (\\"A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness\\"). And while the plot is sprinkled with sinister pseudo-gothic hints, Austen also takes the time to sketch out some romantic deceptions and tangles, as well as some deliciously arch dialogue (\\"I was not thinking of anything.\\" \\"That is artful and deep, to be sure...\\").<br /><br />The only part that falls short is the climactic encounter between Henry and Catherine... which is completely skimmed over, and related only in a distant vague style. \\"I leave it to my reader's sagacity\\" is not a satisfying way to handle that sort of romantically-charged scene.<br /><br />Austen also has fun with Catherine as the unlikely heroine of the piece, especially since she makes it clear that Catherine comes from a very mundane, undramatic background. She's sweet, naive, wide-eyed and essentially good-hearted, but she has a lot to learn about reality (especially about the golddigging family that befriends her). And Henry is an oddity among Austen's heroes, being a clever silver-tongued charmer with a heart of gold who likes to gently tease Catherine.<br /><br />Quick, light and full of teasing humor, \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is an oddity in Jane Austen's string of brilliant novels -- but being a clever, well-plotted spoof doesn't make it any less charming.

But what really disappointed me is the fact that this is a highlight reel from the 1994 concert.  There are so many cuts from the real concert that it is like trying to watch a classic movie that has been reduced to scene highlights.    If you think you are buying the 1994 concert dvd you will be sorely disappointed.  This has to be the most disappointing dvd I have ever purchased.  Anyone want it I will gladly send it for cost of postage...otherwise, in the trash.  (If you really want the songs save your eyes and get the CD)

This is a better book for Pre-school and up then Toddlers due to the delicate cut of its pages.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|This show is one of my new favorites. Not only is it clever and funny, but clean and non-violent. Have been enjoying the second season on USA, but am patiently waiting for the first season to come out on DVD.
B0019CSXAM|4.0|This is one of the best shows on TV, and sadly I discovered it late. However, I to get the benefit of watching them in quick succession on DVD. My only complaint is that the bonus content, aside from commentaries, is fairly sparse by today's standards. The fact is you can finish everything within a couple of days. Still, it's more than worth the price. Just pick it up.

B002RVZV9K|4.0|jimmy page is the reason i wanted to learn guitar.when i first heard whole lotta love, i not only had no clue to what the subject matter was about(i was 10) but i was astonished to find out that a guitar and some of the best panning techniques were responsible for a dizzying audio journey that continues to this day,40 years later.so i jumped at the chance to see this.jack white making a guitar the way the original blues guitarists (minus the amped up pickup)made them was an incredible opening scene.however,the way the film jumped around from guitarist to guitarist was quite annoying.i see what they were trying to do and it was certainly a different way to tell a story (or 3),but it left me frustrated for better continuity.each of the subjects' stories were great and there was some great footage from all 3 players' histories,but when they jammed together,they appeared \\"jammed\\" together and quite directionless and greatly puzzled as to what they were supposed to do with each other.reminded me of bad jamming sessions i've had.no magic (black or otherwise)or hit records coming out of this hook-up but it probably whetted the appetites of those who put it together.i was dissapointed in the end but learned a lot of things anyway.it was a great attempt at what i'm sure looked great in concept,on paper and certainly recieved my attention and money when i first saw the trailer at the previews for \\"shine a light\\".
B001ECQ6YW|4.0|An entertaining, Kung Fu Fun movie for the whole family. Love Jack Black as a big lovable Panda, a really fun movie for Kids and adults alike.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|You can't turn away.  From the first moment, the film's style won't turn you loose.  At its core, this seems like a re-make of some other movie, but the setting (South Africa), the accents, the actors, the special effects, combined with the pacing and inability to guess the outcome, make the film a unique experience.  I recommend it for family viewing, if your kids can handle the gore.
B00000ADG2|5.0|This Album was released First....And went Platinuim! Radio quickly jumped on the cut \\"Lost Ones\\". This quickly went Top 40 on Billboard's Air-Play Chart. \\"Doo Wop\\" was released as a Single and went Gold and peaked at #1 on Billboard's Singles Chart! \\"Ex-Factor\\" started getting play on Radio...It went Top 10 on Billboard's Radio Air-Play Chart! \\"Nothing Even Matters\\" (With D'Angelo) and \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\" both recieved heavy Radio play and they both ended up going Top 40 on Billboard's Radio Air-Play Chart! \\"To Zion\\" (featuring Carlos Santana) stalled at #77 on Billboard's Radio Chart. The big surprise here is ALL 4 (Four): \\"Ex-Factor\\", \\"Nothing Even Matters\\", \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\" and \\"To Zion\\" ALL entered Billboard's Radio Chart on January 2, 1999 AT THE SAME TIME! The final Single released was another Gold selling Billboard Hit   Single \\"Everything Is Everything\\" that peaked at #14! Yeah, I know I should have reviewed this (And bought it) years ago, but damn near everybody had it and/or I was (And still is) hearing it on the Radio!...Well I finally got my own copy and STILL lovin' EVERYTHING about this album! Especially the cut: \\"Tell Him\\" which is part of the 2 (Two) hidden Bonus Compact Disc Tracks...The other Bonus Track is: \\"Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You\\"...Need I say more???
B001GCUNYO|5.0|We're at the tail end of this actor playing hard-hitting action roles in his career.  Liam delivers and was believable as the retired CIA operative-turned-revenge-filled-protective-father.  A good Father's Day film, or simply a good movie to scare the crap out of your little girl before she goes off to college or on a European vacation...
0812973992|1.0|Im pretty sure that this will go down as one of the most over-rated books this past year.  After reading one dazzling review after another i went out and got this book, eager to read the next contemporary masterpiece.  While it is written well it's just one of those books that you end up not caring at all about anyone in it or what happens to them.  Everything is dry, drawn out and unsatisfying.  I tried hard to like this book but it just never happened for me.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Since a few of the reviews give away a bit too much, I'll stick to what will keep the film totally enjoyable for first-time viewers. If you're in the mood for a movie that goes for the quick thrill, Shutter Island isn't for you.<br /><br />Scorsese paints a somber and foreboding painting that slowly draws you in, with just enough tension to keep the pot bubbling. Finally, as the plot descends you deeper into the nightmare, the rug is completely pulled beneath your feet. And that's when the film really gets good.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio shines as U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, who finds himself plunged into a world of confusion and disbelief. The visuals are dark and utterly sinister, and the score is beautifully haunting. The only reason why I gave the film four stars instead of five was because director James Mangold already shot a film with an identical concept (telling you any more would simply spoil it). Take my advice: the less you know about this movie before watching it, the more you will enjoy it.

0385335989|5.0|I have found that all of Gabaldon's Outlander series to be just a good read!  She writes with such descriptive quality as to make one \\"see\\" where she is and what is unfolding before your eyes.  The love story between Jamie and Claire makes one become breathless at their love scenes, and yet, become somewhat melancholy at the depth of love these two people have for each other. A love and understanding only to be dreamt of!  She tells a story both of love and history, that at the end of each chapter, one feels compelled to continue...just one more chapter!  I am a woman possessed with her story.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Something like two years in the making and six years before that in the waiting. But Sade has never been fast at making music, unless you count the time between album one and two.  Earlier this month, they finally released Soldier of Love.<br /><br />While not a huge fan of their overall stuff, I did love their first disk and the rest of their stuff had enough good songs to make up an incredible second disk, if you collected all that good music.<br /><br />My issue is that it starts to blend together too quickly. I suppose I like their first disk because it was so different at the time and now that they are on album six, there isn't tons new to explore.<br /><br />Still, in this world of the auto-tuned artist, or Miley (it's Miley!) or worse, the unveiling that Taylor Swift really cannot sing a note in tune, it is great to hear a band rely on their talent and an extremely good vocalist who needs no embellishment other than a microphone.<br /><br />Their lead-off \\"single\\", and title track, is the one place they do try new exploration, if you will.  The rhythm section really changes it up from what they had done in the past and Sade Adu's vocals take on a new persona.  Alas, it is just for this song, though \\"Babyfather\\" somewhat breaks their traditional mold with some reggae influences.<br /><br />After that, it is back to what they know - which doesn't suck.  While normally I hate complacency and being too consistent in music, anything else for this band would be disconcerting and it probably wouldn't work.<br /><br />I like it because of their talent in writing, playing and singing.  I can't listen to this in repeated sessions, that's not how this music works with me.  But in these days where you do not need talent to be an \\"artist\\", it is nice to know it still exists.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is an amazing end to an amazing series.  Combining wit with Greek mythology could have easily ruined any book, but Riordan did it with an A+ grade, and a few more +s besides!  It's great that he made the characters and poeple with actual Greek weapons(not counting the part when Annabeth's dad saves the day).  This series just wouldn't be the same if all the characters ran around with guns and all that modern day stuff.  The Party Ponies were another exception, but they were crazy enough to make up for it.  This book also does great at using modern statues, buildings, and symbols that supported its story of the gods affecting life in America.  (For example, Daedalus had the statues of New York rigged up to obey his commands, or at least the commands of anyone who knew how to activate them.  All in all, this is one of the best books I have ever read and I encourage everyone to read it.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|It's about time people start to notice Lady Antebellum.  Their first album, had more catchy songs and was better in my opinion, that really defined them as a Country Group.  This second album shows how they've matured as artists, songwriters, and performers.  Need You Now is undeniably their biggest hit to date...crossing over into the Adult Contemporary category.  American Honey (though not written by the trio) was the best follow-up to the ballad.  It's fun, cute, upbeat and extremely catchy.  A favorite of mine \\"Love this Pain\\" seems like a contender for the 3rd single...    ...I have a feeling this group will be winning a lot more Grammy's in the years to come.
0545140315|4.0|What was there not to like about this book?! The Beatles, girl power and some nice romance added to the mix?!!! Eliabeth Eulberg debut book is just amazing.<br /><br />Penny, the protagonist, has just had a horrible break-up. Bringing her to swear off guys for her remaining time at high school and has even started The Lonely Hearts Club, a club where girls vow to not date any guys and most importantly to never let a boy come between friendship. I am all for girl power and so, I completely LOVE this part about the book. I found it refreshing that the main girl of the story along with a lot of others were not going after them for once! The club gets its name after the Beatles 8th album, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.<br /><br />As a Beatles fan, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed all the references in the book. Aside from the main character being named after one of the songs, Penny Lane (along with her sisters Rita and Lucy) her parents are just plain obsessed with them. Here is just one part of the book that I found funny:<br /><br />\\"I can't believe how fast you're growing up. Why, it seems like it was only yesterday...\\"<br />\\"Yesterday...\\" my dad began to sing.<br /><br />Although, the romance in the story is a predictable, it was definitely a joy to read. I loved the characters. Eulberg does a wonderful job of giving them realistic traits. I really enjoyed reading about the guy characters, I thought they were done well!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to someone who is a Beatles fan or just wants to read a nice, fluffy novel!
B002JCSWVG|5.0|Make no mistake, this movie is not about Rubgy, but about how the world can be changed to be a better place.  Using a David vs. Goliath plot for sure makes the movie interesting (South Africa's rugby team), but the change that took place in that country, and how a man had the vision to drive it is the real message.   By the way, this movie for sure will become a reference in leadership trainings, as Apollo 13 did some years ago.  In a nutshell really, really worth to watch, if you want to better understand how change takes place.
B002L5810I|5.0|Ordering this product from the Philippines I knew it was going to take a long time to get here.  But the wait was actually not as long as they said it would be.  The movie itself is TOTALLY worth the wait and the price.  You get to see more familiar footage of Michael dancing, but you also get to see his genious put to a few new things too.  And if you ever thought that some of his music videos...like Smooth Criminal, had a rather curious beginning and end where you though there is more to the story plot, this is definately for you.  A beautiful look into the mind of the amazing King of Pop.  RIP Michael...we love you more! : )

0156027321|4.0|This book was assigned to my English 10 honors class and initially my first thought of this book was that it was going to be completely horrible. However, I am happy to report that it was actually a great story!<br /><br />This isn't your typical English class book. It is fairly recent, written only a couple of years ago instead of the usual book that was published before 1960! The first part of the book is set in the late 70's in Pondicherry, India. Its about a boy with an unusual name; Piscine (sounds almost exactly like pissing), which is French for swimming pool and because kids teased him about it he shorten it to Pi once he got to high school.<br /><br />Religion plays a major part in this book, even claiming in the beginning that it will make you a believer in God. Pi's family isn't particulary religious but he starts practicing not one but three religions. Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. All he wants to do is love God. Another major part of the story is that his father is a zoo keeper. Pi knows all about animals and which ones are dangerous and whatnot. Later on, Pi and his family decided to move to Canada and so, his father sells what animals he could to other zoos and some of the other animals ride on the ship with the family to Canada.<br /><br />We get to the second part. The ship sinks. Without giving away all what happens. I'll say this. I couldn't believe all what Pi has to go through on a lifeboat. With a 450 pound BENGAL TIGER! It really is something to read. And although it was good at that point, I'll admit I didn't keep up with my reading after awhile. One of my reading quizzes proves it!! It was getting closer towards the major test (actually, the night before) and I had to read a little more than 100 pages. I do not think I would have actually read all of it if I hadn't heard the others talking about it in class.<br /><br />Once Pi gets saved (and don't worry, I'm not giving anything away, because you know he lives as there are present tense scenes, which are confusing at first) we learn of a second story that happened while Pi was on the boat. So, its a story within a story and you're left with a question. What story is the truth?!first) we learn of a second story that happened while Pi was on the boat. So, its a story within a story and you're left with a question. What story is the truth?!
B002E2M5IC|5.0|While there are many other great reviews on here for this film already I will throw my hat into the mix with my two cents. Having been raised Jewish myself the film instantly let me relate in a very personal way. I no longer practice but all those prayers and songs stay with you forever. All I need to do is hear some of that stuff and I can almost start chanting in all on my own.<br /><br />Right away the film reminded me of Albert Camus The Stranger. Coen brothers already tackled The Stranger head on with The Man Who Was Not There. Many of their other films deal with fate, free will, personal choice, destiny, and morality. Fargo, The Big Lebowski, No Country For Old  Men are a few that come to mind that deal with these topics. Are we in controll? How does morality factor in, and if we have control can we push or pull against fate or destiny?<br /><br />In ASM Larry is much like Meursault from The Stranger. He is carried along by fate, others, and resists only a little here and there. In The Stranger Meursault never resists his fate and is killed at the end. Every time Larry pushes even a bit there are consequences. As others have eloquently pointed out, acceptance of fate is the core of the film and attempting to be incongruous to it will lead only to problems.  Even the problems encountered by Larry all along are nothing compared to what results when he goes against his own morals at the end.<br /><br />The film is slow and plodding. It was a dense film that will surly produce more gems upon further watching. I do want to watch it again a few times to examine it, I will not be watching this film every second like TBL to just view again and again. I still consider it one of the best films of the year and enjoyed it greatly.
0307269981|4.0|Excellent sequel to \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and a reminder of how much author Stieg Larsson will be missed.  So many reviews have already dissected this book that there isn't much to add.  One thing that I really liked with the writing here was the meticulous chronicling of  Lisbeth Salander's (and others) routines.  Some reviewers hated this as tedious and action-killing, but I thought it brought immediacy and realism to the action and in some instances built some wonderful tension.<br /><br />One other end-of-the-book musing that came to mind--the arch villain in the book, Zalachenko, turns out to have been the most interesting gene-carrier since that family on the planet Kryton.  You have to wonder what other miraculous and/or twisted offspring might turn up in the last book in the series.<br /><br />Finally--strange how this book provoked so many negative reviews from skinheads and others who didn't like the anti-violence-to-women theme that underlies much of this story.  Funny that this was attributed to the Swedes being uniformly left wing.  They aren't, of course, but most of the civilized world is coming around on the need to put an end to abuse of women and children.  Not hardly a left wing issue.
0451228731|4.0|In the beginning, Daniel Sobol died.  He was a computer genius who created Cyberstorm Systems, a gaming company more successful than World of Warcraft.  He left the world a Daemon.  In Unix and other computer multitasking operating systems, a 'daemon' is a computer program that runs in the background, rather than under the direct control of a user; they are usually initiated as background processes (like an alarm clock or a scheduled system back-up).  Sobol was extremely above the curve, and his games were so good because of their advanced AI (artifical intelligence) manipulated the players.  His Daemon does the same thing, only the in real world -- manipulates the players.  In a way, Sobol is acting from beyond the grave when he can no longer be punished.    First the Daemon kills programmers which helped create it, using the internet, in order to remain secret and grow. We meet detective Sobol and Jon Ross, men who wish to fight it.  We meet Gragg, a genius hacker with a meaningless and empty life, who it recruits.  We meet the FBI taskforce, composed of courageous men and women doing their best to preserve America and destroy the Daemon.  Finally we indirectly meet the shadow-rulers, the people who really control the world by enormous wealth, and watch the Daemon declared their world order an enemy.    The book doesn't really have a good ending, seguing directly into the sequel [[ASIN:0525951571 Freedom (TM)]].  Despite that, it was still an enthralling story using technology I've recently read about, but never seen in action.  Haptic sensors, weaponized low frequency sound, fuel cells, integrated GPS with just-in-time conspiracy, and remote controlled vehicles-as-weapons.  The author also uses a high amount of computer terminology without explaining for newbies; this may turn off some readers.    Probably the biggest flaw in the novel is it changes.  At first it is a techno-mystery-thriller, but later more characters are introduced (after a time skip) and it shifts into more of an action/adventure type read with underdeveloped characters.  Still well worth the read simply for the ideas.
B0021L8UPS|4.0|Sigh. I tell you people that Seers usually bend over backwards in order to please the ladies in our lives. Case in point: Sondra the Seerest (Metamorpho's long time main squeeze) and I were relaxing at my castle, having crackers, cheese and wine, when all of a sudden she said, \\"You know what Metamorpho? We really should consider adopting a child, not a baby mind you, but one a little older who will add spice and happiness to the castle.\\" To be perfectly frank people, I was taken aback at the suggestion. Certainly I possess enough spice for the whole world, but, despite my hurt small (!) ego, I gave in, always willing to please to avoid total aggravation.<br /><br />So Sondra and Seer sauntered (yes, I am alliterate) down to the local orphange to see if there were any good prospects. Sister Abagail greeted us and in the process I met Esther. She was sitting all alone by herself creating pictures. I was astounded that they were so good for such a young child. And people, I know good art. I did give Picasso lessons after all. Soon Sondra joined us and she was equally as impressed. Esther was remarkable. Creative, well-mannered, attentive, respectful, intelligent and, well, everything every child should be in this mad, a go-go crazy world we all know. At that point I should have been suspicious, however I wasn't (Seers do have lapses you know. One of the very few faults they have I might add). So, it was decided that Sondra and I would go home to think about it and get back to Sister Abigail the next day.<br /><br />Unfortunately (or fortunately) we missed our chance. Sister Abigail called us the next day to tell us that a couple, Kate and John Coleman, decided they wanted her and papers were being drawn up at that very moment. I wasn't too disappointed, but, to play it safe, I told Sondra after sharing 2 bottles of Pinot Grichio. It went better than expected. She only ripped apart 2 of the 50 Rembrandt originals I had hanging in the castle. I caught her on a good day I suppose.<br /><br />Anyway, that brings us to the story of the Colemans. It seems Kate lost a child in pregnancy and needed a child to make her life complete. They already had two children, a small deaf daughter Max, and a scrappy 7 year old boy Daniel. Why anyone would want another child in this economy is a mystery. Then again, the Coleman's had a modern day castle of their own. So John must be doing very well indeed.<br /><br />It must be stated here that Esther was very weird, and certainly not accepted too well by the children. Daniel didn't like her right off the bat. And who ever said children aren't smarter than adults? But, she was weird people. First off, she wore ridiculous dresses to school, the kids taunted her, and plus she had this Russian accent that took getting used to. Oh yes, I almost forgot, Esther had this temper which would make her scream and bash in bathroom walls. Attention getting for sure, but at home she would be a polite young thing.<br /><br />Now, all young couples have their problems. Kate and John were no different, but they had moved beyond the issues of alcoholism and infidelity before Esther arrived. However, we learn that Esther is a master at manipulation and using people's psychological weaknesses to her advantage. So, she became a virtual wedge between the family and exploited their fears and insecurities against each other.<br />Not only that, but strange things were starting to happen. Unfortunate things. Her behaviour started to concern Kate a lot, but John felt that Kate was out on an imagination limb. Kate was in contact with Sister Abagail and when Sister Abigail came for a visit, Mother Superior not only jumped the gun, but jumped the icy curb as well.<br /><br />More and more Kate suspected something wrong with Esther and did reserach over the internet to find out what. Esther, upon psychological investigation,was found to be totally normal and Kate was perceived as a paranoid nut case. So much for experts. However,John perceived the same as the psychologist and saw Esther as a victimized and unfairly treated child, that is, until...<br /><br />Now people, I have given you part of the tasty tidbits here, but not all of them.

B001V7YWTQ|5.0|I was blown away by the concert on DVD and as a result had to purchase the 2 CD Live Set. I have seen both artists individually live many times but never together.  An unforgettable show not to be missed!  The BluRay DVD sound quality is excellent and was almost as good as actually being there for the show.  A must purchase for any Clapton, Winwood, Cream or Traffic fans.

B00275EGWY|3.0|I watched this with my husband who has been to Iraq three times now.  So much of this movie was really unrealistic and basically crap.  I like the basic premise of it, it's shot well (some of the street scenes were apparently very well done), and there's no politics involved.  But these guys wouldn't have been out clearing alone all the time, or getting off the FOB alone, or doing most of the stuff they do.  It's just annoying to me that people who have no idea what the military is really like will think that this cowboy stuff happens without consequence.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Martin Scorsese's \\"Shutter Island\\" is not an easy film to define. It's simplest to say that it's an experience - suspenseful, taut, brooding, mysterious, and engrossing from the moment the first shot appears, in which a ferry emerges from a veil of dense fog. A story that begins with something emerging from nothing is a very telling sign of what lies ahead, because in that moment, you're forced to ask yourself what lies beyond the veil in both directions. We're told that that ferry set sail from the mainland, specifically Boston, although we never actually see it. For all we know, the boat might have been spawned from the sea. Within the veil lies the titular island, on which sits a former Civil War fort that has been converted into a mental institution for the criminally insane.    The fort looms off in the distance like a harbinger of doom, surrounded by nothing but open water and gray skies becoming heavy with rain. Approaching it by boat are two U.S. federal marshals: Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his new partner Chuck Aule (Mark Ruffalo). Their story takes place in the year 1954, when they're assigned to a case involving the disappearance of a Shutter Island inmate. Once they arrive, they meet the institution's chief physician, Dr. John Cawley (Ben Kingsley), a calm and collected man who has an air of knowing more than he lets on. Everyone on the island comes off the same way - the doctors, the orderlies, the nurses, the security staff, even the patients all seem to be hiding something.    The missing inmate is Rachel Solando, who drowned her own children and, according to Dr. Cawley, has deluded herself into believing that she's still in her home and that all the patients and staff members are her neighbors. Her disappearance, Teddy and Chuck quickly realize, makes absolutely no sense. Her cell was locked. Her window was bared. She would have had to pass a number of people to exit the compound. The island's botanical and geographic configurations wouldn't allow her to travel by foot, especially since she's presumed to have no shoes. She couldn't have fallen off a cliff and drowned, for her body would have already washed up on shore. The weather alone, indicative of an approaching hurricane, would have stopped her. Everything about this woman's situation is impossible.    As the mystery of Rachel Solando deepens, so too does the mystery of Teddy Daniels, who seems lost within his own painful past. In due time, bizarre visions and frightening dreams seem to merge with his desperate need to find the truth. Sometimes, this involves his dead wife, Dolores (Michelle Williams), while at other times it involves memories of liberating a Nazi concentration camp during his last days in World War II. For both himself and the audience, reality becomes less and less definable, pretty much to the point where you no longer believe your own eyes. Clues lead to outlandish discoveries, which in turn lead to more questions. Everything is open to interpretation.    What, for example, is Teddy to make of a note found under a floorboard in Rachel's cell? What about an encounter he has in Ward C, a place reserved for only the most dangerous of inmates? It's here he's forced to roam gloomy stone corridors with nothing but matches to light his way, which is to say he's seeing things only in fragments. What is he to make of Dr. Cawley's colleague, Dr. Naehring (Max von Sydow), a German immigrant who asks the most sinister of questions? What goes on inside a lighthouse seen off in the distance? And what of Rachel herself? Has she truly escaped, or is she still somewhere on Shutter Island?    What makes this movie brilliant is that it isn't really about the plot, nor is it about the ending, which on all rational levels is utterly preposterous. The film's purpose, as I understand it, is to take the audience on a purely emotional journey, to consistently evoke feelings of uncertainty and terror as the dark recesses of the mind are explored. Relying heavily on the conventions of film noir, where heroes are troubled souls and shadows conceal all kinds of secrets, Scorsese doesn't tell a story so much as establish mood for just over two hours. When it comes to the mind, whatever form that may take, story is inconsequential; we can go in just about any direction and wind up just about anywhere.    Which brings me back to the ending. It may seem like a typical Hollywood plot twist, but it offers no real payoff, and that's because the reality of everything leading up to it is in doubt. If we can't trust the beginning and middle sections, how on earth can we trust the end? I don't think we should even try. \\"Shutter Island\\" is not about a logical sequence of events or a mechanical resolution. It's about keeping audiences in a perpetual state of confusion and apprehension (as Teddy Daniels seems to be) through the talents of the cast and filmmakers. When it was over, I thought not about the technical details or the narrative trickery, but about the overall effect it had on me. It played its game, and I wanted to play right along with it. What a captivating movie.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|Move over Rhoda! Move over Nomi! HERE'S ESTHER!!!!! This movie is so wrong it's right. I haven't laughed so hard at a new Hollywood movie since Showgirls. I don't know where to begin... this horror film is of the highest camp order, all held together thanks to the evil performance of an 11 year old. Not since Patty McCormack has the been such a convincing performance by a little girl!<br /><br />I'm glad there are executives in in L.A. who are willing to try something and absolutely fail at their efforts. With so many hands involved in movies these days, there's less and less of a chance for films like this to be made - films so bad that every turn creates a camp experience that truly wows.<br /><br />Rent this movie, invite 10 of your funniest friends and let the fun begin.

1591843162|5.0|Initially I was somewhat dismayed by the title of this book, as most indispensable people I have come across, became so by camping and holding anyone at bay who might try to move into their field. But wow I am glad that I nonetheless picked up this awesome little book. Life changing is perhaps a big word to use, but already several of the insights have helped me, specifically the advice about monitoring your own resistance and attacking it. Telling yourself that you are sabotaging your success when you procrastinate, actually works.<br /><br />Seth writes \\"it doesn't matter that you are always right, it does matter that you are always moving\\" and continues with \\"if you wait for a job to be good enough to deserve your best attention it's unlikely you will ever have that job\\". This kind of attitude really helps in modern big (read static) organizations and I am glad they have become a part of my mindset. A few readers have pointed out that these ideas are not new. Perhaps not (nothing rarely is) but the points are nevertheless presented with a clarity and enthusiasm that makes you want to stand up and fight the good fight. And if that's the outcome from this book, then I could personally not care about whether it's content is new or not.
0393316041|4.0|I must agree with both, the three-star and the five-star-reviewers.  Feynman might just have been a jerk in some ways, yet it seems unmistakable, that at the core he was a sincere and honest man, even WITH his bar-hopping adventures, which appeared to me rather harmless.  What I pondered quite a bit is his approach to things religious or the lack of it.  Undeniably, religion has created some of the worst habits and behaviors in history.  There are untold numbers of people 'of the cloth' - not merely the ones, who make this their calling, but too many who simply align with that direction - and in spite, have engaged in abominable behavior.  Here, I much prefer an eccentric scientist who spends some time in bars, able to quit doing so at the drop of a hat, than religious leaders with dual personalities.  Feynman, by completely removing religion as a distraction, could indeed follow his free, adventurous spirit and his remarkable honesty.<br /><br />I found it refreshing to read recollections by an accomplished person, written in the style of an everyday Joe, people like you and I.  Lots of what is generally considered great art, is produced by people with tremendous personal hang-ups, yet people laud them as 'great accomplishments of humanity and its evolution' etc.  What Feynman disliked and discouraged vehemently i.e. what is now evident as the 'dumbing-down' of the general public, is the 'not learning and behaving in constructive ways', something this country is experiencing more and more.  We don't need a dumb public, offset by great art or science, we need a higher average level of 'being and understanding', where all engage in some art & some science and understand what they're talking about, thus making us a more considerate, meaningful species.

B002POVIMS|4.0|For those of you who grew up anywhere near the 80's this album is for you.  All the catchy tunes with lyrics actually worth singing along too.  I won't go indepth, but listening to La Roux brings pictures of John Hughes movies popping in your head and wishing you still owned a Rubik's Cube.  At the same time the songs are very 'now'.  Love it.<br /><br />Elly Jackson herself is a cross between Molly Ringwald and Tilda Swinson with just a dash of David Bowie. 'nough said.
B001CU1RRM|4.0|I searched and searched to find the most complete collection of Michael's hits and this one seems to be it! The only song I think that wasn't on it but should have been is Rockin' Robin. Gotta love the eco-friendly packaging as well.

0385341008|5.0|When I first opened this book recommended to me by a friend I cringed at the sight of letters...the whole book was written by letters written back and forth with the main character. But I was delighted in the end. It was well done. A little bit of history and romance...perfect!
1883011159|5.0|This is classic  literature from one of America's great writers. In high school I was required to read The Grapes of Wrath for my literature class. At the time I liked the novel but did not really appreciate how timeless and what an epic it was.<br /><br />Recently my family and I bought a cattle ranch in far west Oklahoma and I was introduced to what happened in the Dust Bowl depression time.I had to buy this book and read again about the Great Depression and families moving from the dust bowl in an attempt to find a better life. The Grapes of wrath is a fictitious story but the master genius writer John Steinbeck uses many many actual facts and events that really happened in the depression.<br /><br />His writing style is so richly descriptive and thought provoking Steinbeck eventually  received a Nobel Prize for Literature in 1962. John Steinbeck a true American writing genius. Shortly after The Grapes of Wrath was published many schools and colleges banned it as being too controversial and creating too strong emotions and  being un american.<br /><br />We see families out of work during the depression and starving. Banks are taking their homes and farms because they cant make the payments. Its affecting tens of millions of people. Catastrophic. We do see some of the good things in people doing what little sharing and charity they can. However there is much evil in the hearts of many man and women. Hundreds of thousands of agriculture advertisements are given out to people in the Dust Bowl states to come to California (the land of milk and honey) to get picking produce work in the fields. Poor farming techniques by farmers have left the land without nutrients and unable to hold the valuable topsoil in the Midwest states. The wind just blows the topsoil away and a barren non producing dust bowl is left. Millions flee to California to try to get work in the fields. Its a total rip off. The big ag companies just wanted unlimited cheapest labor. These people are starving and the big ag companies say Ill pay you 20cents/hr to pick. Competition pickers said Ill pick for 10cents/hour. Some said 5 cents per hour etc. etc. Then the big farmers only kept the best pickers that could pick the most and paid them the least. This was all a sham to get the cheapest labor. Then there is the ultimate horror. There are tons and tons of produce grown that the big ag companies can not sell at a profit. They deliberately throw kerosene on mountains of perfectly good food and light it. Starving desperate families watch this. People are left to starve.<br /><br />After reading this book one thinks maybe another Great Depression could happen. We may be skating financially on very thin ice in this country. Try to prepare a little just in case the unthinkable happens again.<br /><br />This story is about change and man eventually doing better for his fellow man. Its a powerful story that really gets you thinking about what people are capable of for good and for evil.<br /><br />The other stories in this collection are excellent too but The Grapes of Wrath is the one everyone remembers and will be a classic forever. Now I know why it was required reading in high school literature 40 years ago. INMO every family library should have at least 10 pieces of classic literature. This John Steinbeck collection is one of them. 5 staranies say Ill pay you 20cents/hr to pick. Competition pickers said Ill pick for 10cents/hour.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is fantastic -- what an inspiration. Her rendition of Wild Horses brings such positive emotion.  She also includes several hymns -- my favorite How Great Thou Art.  Her music touches the soul, and inspires the heart.  Pass it on....
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I have enjoyed the new Doctor Who series!  I can remember the old series and sets would fall down.  Tom Baker was my favorite at that time, but David Tennant was the best, while Chrisopher Eccleston was wonderfully as the 9th Doctor.      Billie Piper was always be my favorite companion because both the 9th and 10th Doctors were very, very fond of Rose.      Mr. Russell T. Davis, thank you for bring back Doctor Who!
B000002P2W|5.0|While this album is regarded by most fans as \\"passable\\", \\"The Who By Numbers\\" is in fact my 2nd favorite Who Album (Quadrophenia being the first) I always hear this album is Townshend's \\"pity party\\", but it means a lot to me.  Although the songs are personal, I can somehow relate to a lot of it. Being only a child when this was released, it still resonates to me today. The first track, \\"Slip Kid\\", is a GREAT opener. Daltrey sings this one with pure anger in his voice (That's what I get from it) The other thing that gets me about this song is Entwistle's amazing bass line. The lyrics seem to thumb the nose at the music industry, almost like a warning to up and coming musicians. Regardless, as a song, it's very heavy for something from 1975.  \\"However Much I Booze\\", A song about alcoholism, is straight forward, no-holds barred true storytelling. Love the acoustic intro. \\"Squeeze Box\\", the commercial hit on this record (In The U.S) is incredibly catchy (Is that a banjo I hear?) I'm not going to review every single track, but two songs \\"Blue Red And Grey\\", with only Pete and his ukelele, is just a beautifully written song. (Almost sounds like a \\"going away\\" note) and the incredible \\"How Many Friends\\" (My favorite track on the record) Personal to Townshend, but relateable to just about any one I think. Keith Moon's drumming on this song, to me, is absolutely hypnotic...Listen to the drums on this song and follow them, you'll see what I mean. Must have broken some drum heads recording this for sure! All in all, this is a gem of a Who album. I cannot recommend it enough.
0618918248|5.0|This book is a very good analysis of the \\"proof\\" that is commonly given for the existence of a god. I was hesitant to give it a read at first, because I'd heard that Dawkins tends to be very \\"strident\\", but he isn't at all. He's simply treating religion and the existence of god as a hypothesis, and writing about just like a scientist would write about any other hypothesis. We're so used to the special treatment that these subjects (religion and god) receive in public discourse that when someone writes about them just like anything else, it *seems* radical and strident even when it's not.
B001CGJ3QS|3.0|For me, WK is one of the great pianists of the last century.    My issue is that the technical quality of these CDs is a disappointment.      I am surprised that none of the reviewers mention this.      IMO, a recording of a top German pianist, by a top notch German record company, from the 1965 (NOT THE STONE AGE!), should be of a significantly better recording quality.    IMO, rock music from this era sounds of significantly better technical quality than these CDs.    I am very surprised by this!  I wonder if there was a production problem with my particular CD set.    I emailed Deutschegrammophon 1 W ago to allow them to respond to my problem, before I post this review, but have received nothing from them, (unless my spam filter killed it).      What is the problem with the sound.  Significant white noise in the background of every CD from the set which I have tried.    IMO, substandard sonic detail of the piano.      Who is this product for.  The musician who wishes  to study the intonation from this master pianist.      Who is this not for.  Someone who wishes to simply enjoy the Sonatas of Beethoven.    For that potential buyer, my advise is, stay away from this product, stay away from older DG recordings unless you are sure that they are of good technical quality.    Look for a more modern recording with better technical recording quality, perhaps from a different record company.
0764207407|5.0|If you love Jane Austen, you will love this edition of Sense and Sensibility.<br /><br />I admit I was at first a little skeptical of reading an \\"insight edition\\" as often I have found, in the past, insights to be annoying and often detract from the story. That is not the case in this edition of Sense and Sensibility. I found most of the insights to be very helpful and often amusing.<br /><br />This timeless classic is brought to life in even greater detail through the insights included in this version. It includes many fascinating details from Jane Austen's own life which help explain her perspective on many different situations. Many of the insights have to do with bringing the rich cultural details out to a generation who may not immediately relate to life and places in the early 1800's.<br /><br />For those who have loved (or even hated) the many movies and mini-series' based on this book, you will find frequent comparisons, applause, and criticisms of the film versions.<br /><br />The faith that is evident, though not always clearly, is brought out and given Scriptures references for throughout the book. I found these very interesting as I had never thought of Sense and Sensibility as a Christian book before.<br /><br />This is definitely a book all Jane Austen aficionados will love. If you've never read Jane Austen, I strongly recommend you make this the first one you read.<br /><br />I must mention that I did receive a complimentary review copy of this book, however that in no way influenced my opinion.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|I buy every Mark Knopfler CD that he does now.  I listen to each one over and over in the car before the songs sink in.  At first I almost always think that the songs are blasé.  Then a few emerge and go on my list of fantastic songs that I wondered how I lived without.  Then some of the other songs that I didn't really care for at first start to emerge and I begin to like them too.  Usually I end up liking every song on the CD, eventually, and I never seem to get sick of them.  It just takes awhile to \\"get\\" some of the songs.    Mark Knopfler has become my favorite musician and he's vastly underrated in my opinion.  But who cares.  People simply don't know what they are missing.  They don't play his music on the radio and that's good because frankly it's too good for the radio, although once in awhile it would be nice to hear one.  The bottom line; it takes a little while to really get his music, but once you do, there's nothing else like it.  Simply fantastic.  And some of the most beautiful guitar playing on the planet.
0385532458|5.0|Tonight I reluctantly finished this volume of stories by John Grisham--- such a well-done book. I am very particular about short stories and think they are a difficult format in which to write. To write an economical piece that is also \\"complete\\" has to be a great challenge for a writer, and Grisham has succeeded admirably. As with any collection, some of the stories were more appealing to me than others, but all were good.<br /><br />In these stories, Grisham returns to Clanton, the setting of his first novel, A Time to Kill. The characters are real and diverse; the character development is  strong; the plots are good; the stories are clever and engrossing.....and while he does not write about the law, it is in every story in some way. Grisham spins a good yarn. Although the stories are unrelated, because they all take place in or near Clanton, the reader gets a sense of the community as a whole.<br /><br />I really hated for this book to end.
B001FB5634|2.0|Having found Cormac McCarthy's novel to be poetic, disturbing, gripping and thought-provoking, I highly anticipated this film - especially given the talent involved. At a basic level the film is sevicably faithful to the book. The visuals of the postapocalyptic world are striking and convincing. The acting is good, and Viggo Mortenson fully embodies the character of the man.<br /><br />There are two things that primarily work against the film. First, the evocative power of McCarthy's prose is simply untranslatable to film. The story alone is not particularly compelling. Second, the film indulges in too much sentimentality. This occurs through the repetitive flashbacks to the man's wife, through some of the encounters and exchanges with strangers, and finally in the somewhat overwrought ending.<br /><br />In the end, I was left unmoved by the experience, and felt no emotional connection to film. While the novel is destined to be a long remembered classic, this film seems destined to fall into the dustbins of memory long before the apocalypse ever arrives.

B000ZECQ08|5.0|I have yet to read the books of Harry Potter.  However, I have enjoyed the films, because they are a different creation altogether.  People complain about the films not being as good as the books and there is only so much you can fit into a film without losing the audience.  It was a great story and I really enjoyed the message friends sticking together in difficult times.  After seeing this I cannot wait to read the books.  The action is great, the character development is wonderful, and it kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end.
0143038583|4.0|Food books tend to fall in one of two categories: (1) preachy, \\"I'm better than you\\" books, which guilt you into eating vegetarian, vegan, organic, or what have you; and (2) gross-out books, exposes of the fast food industry that will leave you queasy after every page. I was looking for a food book that broke out of these predictable molds, and found it in The Omnivore's Dilemma.    Pollan makes clear very on he's not trying to preach or make value judgments. Indeed, he is a meat-eater himself and is very mindful of the limitations of both vegetarianism and the practical difficulties of eating organic (cost and the rise of industrial organic). He generally lives up to these ideals, slipping only a few times when he's heaping praise on the Polyface Chicken Farm (with his conclusory assertions that their chicken \\"tastes like chicken\\" when other chicken doesn't). But, this is but a blip on the radar of a fair, engrossing look into where our food comes from, how it's made, and how it gets into our bodies.    I have no problem with the other food genres I speak of above; it's just that I wasn't looking for that kind of read here. Pollan is a fair, practical foodie who also happens to write very well, making this a very enjoyable read. I recommend it.
0788729179|3.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Bridget Jone's Diary, and have been since I first came in contact with the book.  When I saw the movie, I was delighted by Renée Zellweger as Bridget.  She came off very \\"Bridget-y\\"    I lived with a girl with a very British accent, and she read me the book over the course of several days, much to my eternal delight.      I spent quite a bit of time trying to find an unabridged version of the book on DVD or as mp3s, but to no avail.  When I finally saw it on cassette, I decided I would acquiesce and buy the outdated media, and I could at least enjoy Bridget in my old walkman.    Unfortunately, the woman reading the book, though very British, is probably 30 or 40 years too old to be a convincing Bridget.  I just can't get into the idea that someone who sounds so matronly could be writing the journal entries that our Bridget pens.      I don't know if that sounds ridiculous to the normal person, but it's my two cents.  Take it for what it's worth.  If you want a decent Bridget Jones audio, find a nice British girl (or someone who fakes British well) in her mid 20s to early 30s, and get her to read the thing to you.      At least until I win the lottery and have enough money to get Helen Fielding to sell me the rights so I can pay Miss Zellweger to release her own version of it...
1592402690|4.0|This offers a great view of the fab four from someone who spent hundreds of hours in the studio with them. Most of these stories are already well known to Beatle fans, but it's interesting to get them from a different perspective. There is a tangible sense of excitement as Emerick details the groundbreaking recording sessions for Revolver and Sgt. Pepper. Likewise, his accounts of the directionless post-India period and tense White album sessions are particularly fascinating.    Even though Emerick is one of the most renowned engineers on the planet, there is an overwhelming sense that he believes he hasn't gotten the proper credit he deserves for his contributions to the Beatles recordings. This is an issue throughout the book and becomes grating after awhile. The most irritating aspect of the book is his relentless bashing of George Harrison. Most readers probably agree that McCartney was a better songwriter, singer, and musician than George Harrison, but to belabor the point to this extreme is incredibly annoying and detracts from an otherwise enjoyable read.     Overall this is a fascinating book, and with copies selling for $4, you can't go wrong.     Pookie says buy it.
B0000035E7|5.0|Similar to Soundgarden's start, Bleach was a humble beginning for a band that was destined for greatness.  And although Soundgarden came to be one of grunge's best, Nirvana became grunge's best.  You can't deny that Nirvana did great things, but that was in 1991, which was two whole years after their humble beginning.  So I'm going to do this in two ways:  I'm going to bring forth the pros and cons.  So here are the pros: aside from Soundgarden's [[ASIN:B000000M4A Ultramega OK]] album, Bleach is the best document of grunge's early days.  Bleach is a combo of heavy and sludgy guitars and pounding drums merged together with punk speed and flavor with a healthful dose of punkish humor (see \\"Floyd the Barber\\" for this one) and some of these tracks become instant classics.  Good examples of this are the tracks \\"Blew\\", \\"Negative Creep\\", and \\"Mr. Moustache\\".  \\"Love Buzz\\" hooks you in with that alluring opening riff, and \\"About a Girl\\" is a precursor to the band's legendary [[ASIN:B000003TA4 Nevermind]] album.  The lyrics are random, but most include the trademark angst of grunge.  Now the cons: this album is NOT a lost classic.  A good portion of fans that came to be from Nevermind may be scared away from the album just like Soundgarden (more specifically [[ASIN:B000002G2B Superunknown]]) fans might be cautious about Ultramega OK.  As it is with almost every debut album of many great bands, the album is the result of a band that has not found their sound yet.  Most of the tracks from a quick glance may sound like the same sludgy songs (with the exception of \\"Love Buzz\\") unless you take a closer look.  But I will say that it is not the band's fault.  The impact of Nevermind might have arrived two years earlier had Cobain not ignored his pop-writing tendencies due to the grunge scene and pressure from Sub Pop to keep it grunge.  I'd say that it was a good idea that Nirvana cut free of Sub Pop, went for a major label, and embraced The Beatles-induced pop-influence.  So what'sthe verdict?  If you're a hardcore Nirvana fan, or if you're looking for a good document on the rise of grunge, Bleach is a good choice.  I can't say much else.

B001GCUER0|5.0|This series grabbed me as few television programs have. I decided to view a random episode one evening to see what all the accolades were about. I was skeptical that I would be interested to watch past the first commercial break, but  I was blown away by the human drama.  The plots are completely absorbing, the characters (none of whom is heroic) are fascinating, and the period details are really fun.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Shutter Island seems to be getting a lot of love or hate from the critics, but I happen to fall into the love circle of opinion, with maybe just a foot sticking out. The story really drew me in and even though I figured out the final twist early on (it's somewhat obvious and it's a BIG one), I didn't know how it would get to that point and why.<br /><br />The acting is terrific by everyone. Leonardo DiCaprio gets better and better with each passing film. Just look how far he has progressed since his weak turn in Gangs of New York (or maybe it was just Daniel Day-Lewis stealing his thunder). Ben Kingsley is always fascinating to watch and all the other big names in roles large and small put forth very good efforts, from Mark Ruffalo, Max von Sydow, Patricia Clarkson, Ted Levine, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, all the way to Jackie Earle Haley.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is considered by most to be one of the finest directors to ever live, and while Shutter Island is better than his average works like Cape Fear or Bringing Out the Dead, it's not one of his best. Still, you can't deny his visual style, the atmosphere he can create, or the way he can capture the inner torment of one's soul (by using some really freaky dream sequences in this case).<br /><br />Now, on the slightly negative side. I think I would have liked it even more had it not reminded so much of David Fincher's film, The Game. If you haven't seen that movie, you will probably have your mind blown with this one.<br /><br />Shutter Island is not flawless in any sense, but it's a well crafted mystery with plenty of chills. Now, what idiot moved this film's release date from the month of Halloween to February? I guess SAW VI had them running for cover. What a sad statement that is.

I'm doing a project with my 14 year old students in Spain, reading the graphic novel in English and the book both in Catalan and Spanish, and the general opinion is that the drawings are very disturbing... but they really love them!if you have time, have a look at what they think about the characters in our blog:  [...]
B002C2XXJY|5.0|Believe it or not, I'm a 39-year-old male who has come to like 17-year-old actress/singer Demi Lovato. I say again! I'm a guy on the doorstep of 40 and I actually like both of her records! Her 2007 debut, \\"Don't Forget\\", was a very enjoyable pop/rock record that showed a sense of Adult Contemporary maturity that is lacking in the sound quality of her Disney Channel counterparts such as Miley Cyrus (although I do enjoy some of her songs), her real-life BFF Selena Gomez, and Ashley Tisdale. Let it also be known that in terms of vocal talent, Lovato appears to be the best among the four.<br /><br />On her second effort, 2009's \\"Here We Go Again\\", she continues to expand on her ever-growing maturity in terms of sound and production. The songwriting is simple but effective, which gives it that unique balance of being a record that your young daughter would sing along to, but you'll find yourself dancing along with. With remarkably catchy songs that highlight her apparent four-octave range (?), both of her albums appear to be a hybrid of Tween Pop sensitivity & Adult Contemporary maturity.<br /><br />Clocking in at just over 46 minutes over 14 tracks, the album's opener, the title track, is a rockin' cut that could've done without the final cymbal crash at the very end. \\"Solo\\", \\"U Got Nothin' On Me\\", \\"Everything You're Not\\", & \\"World Of Chances\\" are solid, thoroughly enjoyable tracks that are just comfortable to hear. \\"Catch Me\\" & \\"Gift Of A Friend\\" are outstanding slow ballads, but \\"Everytime You Lie\\" is the standout song here, a wonderful slice of R&B/Jazz-tinged pop that could be easily used in a party/club scene in a TV series like \\"Melrose Place\\", \\"90210\\", or the now-departed \\"The O.C.\\".<br /><br />As the primary star of [the Disney Channel Original Series] \\"Sonny With A Chance\\", it's only fitting the album closes with the show's theme song \\"So Far So Great\\". The sing-songy arrangement is a bit daunting, but this girl gives it a spirited \\"YEOOWWWW\\" at the end and redeems it nicely. But Lovato deserves a lot of credit for being able to hold this record together with a vocal range that seems to be beyond her 17 years of age (as of this writing). Yeah, she's no Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey or even Beyonce' and she's not trying to be. Truth be told? She's not SUPPOSED to be .... and she SHOULDN'T be!!!<br /><br />Take into account that both \\"Don't Forget\\" & \\"Here We Go Again\\" were released by a major label (Hollywood Records) NOT affliated with Disney. That speaks volumes about the impression they had about Lovato's talent and the sound she managed to create a mere two records in. Solid and consistent, \\"Here We Go Again\\" is just an infectious, catchy, and just plain comfortable record. Her vocal talent & sound will mature with age and that should be expected. When that does happen, it's possible she'll give the aforementioned ladies a run for their money.<br /><br />Key Tracks: \\"Everytime You Lie\\", \\"Here We Go Again\\", \\"Gift Of A Friend\\",<br />\\"Falling Over Me\\", \\"Catch Me\\".<br /><br />Honorable Mention: \\"So Far So Great\\" (only for Demi's \\"YEOOWWWW!\\" at the end).to deserves a lot of credit for being able to hold this record together with a vocal range that seems to be beyond her 17 years of age (as of this writing).

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Absolutely love this movie, but was utterly disapointed that i did not get the movie that i ordered from Amazon.  I checked the delivery process and both Amazon and my home town post office showed as delivered.  It was not!  Not very happy that i'm out the money I paid for it.  On top of that, my husband went to Wal-Mart and purchased the movie for me.  Wow, although i Love MJ, am not happy that we spent over 40.00 dollars.

0307266303|5.0|I am not a \\"runner\\" by any sense, but what got me interested in this book was vibram fivefingers.  I kind of thought when I got this book it would be a book about minimalist running.  While that content is certainly in the story, it is more a story about the joy of running.  Even if you don't run and just want to read a great story, I'd recommend this book.
B00275EGWY|3.0|The Hurt locker is a decent war flick, although with Youtube and Cnn and the likes what goes on overseas isn't exactly a mystery anymore especially since alot of soldiers have been sharing their footage with the world. The Hurt Locker pretty much is a movie that tries to be as close to reality as possible while still being a movie. The movie mainly focuses on the tasks of a bombsquad unit, and their \\"unique\\" replacement bombtech after the previous one is kia.<br /><br /> The hurt locker doesn't ever go in to detail about the characters or who they are. Even the main character remains pretty much a mystery till the end. The acting is great, and the focal point of the story \\"being an American soldier in Iraq\\" is shown pretty well for what the movie is. I know there has been post after post about how this movie doesn't exactly mirror military protocal etc etc. but look... I never heard a Vietnam vet complain about Apocolypse now, Plantoon, or Full metal jacket... you dont see WWII veterans complaining about Saving private Ryan. So what if it's not line for line... this is a \\"movie\\" so please keep that in mind.<br /><br /> There's a lot of good action in the film, but it's predictable. The movie has the habbit of going into \\"widescreen\\" whenever something is about to happen. Also the movie isn't \\"gory\\" it's more dramatized violence than what you would actually see. Like if a soldier was blown up you'd see his helmet roll by, or if someone got shot you would just see their body fall. Not much blood to be shown in this war movie so it's more or less about the dialogue.<br /><br /> Since the characters pretty much remain a mystery to you there's not really anyone to root for. Watching the Hurt locker kind of felt like catching a good movie half way before it ends. It's good and you enjoy it, but you missed the first part of it that explained all the detail of what's going on. That is why I rated the film a 3/5. It's not a bad or dislikable film by any means, it's just that you never really get to understand who the characters are or where they are even from that makes them do what they do, and act like they act.t to understand who the characters are or where they are even from that makes them do what they do, and act like they act.
B0007SM922|5.0|\\"Looking in\\" is my favorite S B album. Imagine Kim Simmonds playing lead guitar for Foghat and you have a good idea of how this sounds. The amazon reviewer likes \\"Raw Sienna\\" better. It is a great album but in my opinion \\"Looking\\" in is straight up rock--which is what I love.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Buy this CD! This CD is that good.  The music will make you clap and stomp your feet and the lyrics are deep and powerful and emotional.  Many of the songs reach a cresendo of raw emotion.  I can not think of a CD in the last 5 years that I liked this many songs on and listen to so many times in just a few days.  They are amazing.  If you saw them on Letterman or have youtubed Cave or Little Lion Man and thought those songs were good, well get the CD because the rest of the CD is that good.  Man, I can't wait to see these guys live.  I hope this group makes it big in the US, they are that good.

B00062I6TO|5.0|At this point, there have been several reviews of Carlos Kleiber's New Year's Concert in Vienna, and all seem to agree that it's a wonderful performance.  So what more can I add?  Well, I'll tell you a little bit about the program and performance.<br /><br />The program includes more than a dozen waltzes and polkas by Johann Strauss the younger and the elder,  and by Josef Strauss.  I could not find even one that I failed to enjoy, both because of the charm of the music and the loving attention that Carlos Kleiber lavishes on each piece.<br /><br />For instance, in the Peasants' Polka you will enjoy the delight and merry-making of the musicians, as Kleiber and the score call for the entire orchestra to sing along with the music.  All look to be having an uproariously good-spirited time.<br /><br />Another aspect that makes this performance appropriate to share with others, perhaps especially also for children, is the opportunity to see and hear some rather unusual instruments.  You get to see \\"in action\\" the unusual instruments that achieve the sounds of a clock striking the hours, a carriage horse's clip-clopping hooves, a cuckoo, a chirping bird, and many others.<br /><br />It's simply a very happy holiday evening shared by Carlos Kleiber, the Vienna Philharmonic, the live audience in attendance, and we the happy few invited to attend it in our own homes.
0385751060|4.0|An easy read but very moving - the innocence of children comes over in a big way - very enjoyable if sad.
0307588335|2.0|I was quite disappointed by this book and frankly the only reason i finished reading it was because a good friend of mine that worked at Lehman explained to me the back half of the book was better than the first half.  He was right, but the book was so melodramatic that it was absolutely ridiculous in some areas.  In fact there is a point in the book where the author describes the transgressions of some Lehman officers as being equivalent to the three times Peter denied Christ.  Yeah....that bad!<br /><br />The first half describes the upbringing of the author and how he made his way to Wall Street the hard way.  Throughout the book he draws on ealier experiences and credits those experiences for his investment savvy.  Frankly, I bought the book to pick up some additional insights from an insider on the demise....not to learn about how the author had to sell pork chops to break into an entry level retail brokerage job.<br /><br />The back half of the book puts a little more meat on the bones of the tragedy of Lehman's demise, but is still lacking.  The metaphors and the melodrama really damage the credibility of the author as people that have  real investment skill rarely speak in such an obsequious manner.  I have some sympathy for the author in that I had/have a lot of friends at Lehman/Barclays and was at their side the whole way down, but unfortunately the book has a tone of a crying child complaining that the world is not fair.  As such, i really struggled getting through this book.

B00012FXAE|5.0|This has to be one of the best action movies ever! There are times where I feel like watching Merchant Ivory films, then there are times when I feel like watching some A** getting kicked. When I feel that urge come over me I usually put in Aliens, The ultimate Kick A** Movie. Can I say that Ripley (Weaver) is the Coolest Action hero ever(Man or Woman)! Even though this movie came out in 1986 this movie holds up suprisingly well.

B002QW7AJY|3.0|You unlock this door with the key of imagination. Beyond it is another dimension...a dimension of sound...a dimension of sight...a dimension of mind. You're moving into a land of both shadow and substance...of things and ideas. You've just crossed over into: The Twilight Zone.<br /><br />But unlike the classic 30 minute Twilight Zone episodes, you will enter into over 90 minutes of pandorum with Pandorum. Pandorum being defined as dementia brought on by extended periods of hypersleep / suspended animation. In other words, if this movie was edited down to 30 minutes, I'd have probably been inclined to suggest that you not miss this movie if you are a fan of the classic [[ASIN:B000H5U5EE Twilight Zone]] series. But what ultimately is delivered with this movie--since there really is no platform to bring this story to you in 30 minutes--is a fluffy sci-fi thriller that would have been great had the fluff been removed.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid and Ben Foster are great in the lead roles and could have / should have carried this movie virtually solo. Picture two guys who wake up out of a very long hypersleep with the side effect of amnesia on a deep space mission to an Earth-like planet in a distant galaxy. They are locked inside the chamber where their hypersleep units are, and they need to find a way out of the chamber so that they can restore power to their ship in order to continue their journey.<br /><br />Three key things happen: 1) One of the guys gets free of the hypersleep area. 2) They start to remember stuff. 3) They discover that their ship may be off course and that they may not be the only ones \\"awake\\" on the ship. (Okay, technically that's 4 things.)<br /><br />What happens next is scary, intense and thrilling at times. Silly, goofy and unbelievable at times. Thought provoking and reminiscent of The Twilight Zone at times. But most of all just a long (really long) episode of The Twilight Zone. Which isn't a bad thing. I loved The Twilight Zone, but I loved it at 30 minutes a clip. 90 minutes to tell the Pandorum story just added too much goofy and length to keep it far from the reaches of greatness.<br /><br />Do indeed give Pandorum a try when it comes on cable if you're into the genre, but save your money for a Blu Ray purchase of something more worthy.at 30 minutes a clip. 90 minutes to tell the Pandorum story just added too much goofy and length to keep it far from the reaches of greatness.<br /><br />Do indeed give Pandorum a try when it comes on cable if you're into the genre, but save your money for a Blu Ray purchase of something more worthy.

B00004SST6|5.0|It is no secret that George Benson is one of the most talented guitarists and singers in jazz (his first musical realm as a recording artist) and R&B/pop (where he is better known to the great audiences). But through most of the '80s and '90s not much of the jazz side of him was much in evidence. A big waste of talent, even as he continued a good and lucrative career. Since the mid-90s Benson has added more elements of jazz into his music, to good effect, and this '99 album is his best foray into contemporary smooth jazz. While not as hardcore jazz as his '60s recordings, I say it is a fine addition to Benson albums such as \\"Breezing\\" and \\"Weekend in LA\\", works that successfully blended serious jazz chops with friendly, accessible grooves.    Backed by a tight small combo including the great key player Joe Sample, Benson leads (or perhaps co-leads, as Sample writes most of the tunes and is prominent in all arrangements) a tight band that plays a classy, funky, smooth collection of tracks ranging from smooth funk-jazz to ,well, smooth jazz ballads and one blues by Ray Charles.     Not much vocal work from Benson here, though he sings well in the opening tune \\"The Ghetto\\" and the blues track. His playing is super tasty and brilliant, and you will get plenty of his trademark scat singing doubled by the guitar. He delivers!    The first 2 tracks are lively, rhythmic, \\"The Ghetto\\" is a groovy marvel and \\"El Barrio\\" even raises the energy up a notch with a faster tempo. Then things mellow out a bit and you get a selection of ballads. My favorite is \\"Deeper than You Think\\". Good stuff but I miss something catchy like \\"Breezing\\". But it is all very tasty and overall a very nice project. 'Hipping the Hop\\" is an intriguing, inventive jazz tune. And the final tune, \\"Medicine Man\\", co-written by Benson and Sample, it is a fine jam: great atmosphere, layered arrangement, propelled by a funky, sexy groove and with serious playing by Benson and Sample.    I wish these guys get together more often because of course there is chemistry and great musicianship at play in this album. A worth addition if you like Benson and/or Sample.

Some of the clothing was very suggestable in my opionion.  I would not recommend this video at all.  Though others who gave it a bad review, said they had seen better ones done live.  So i am going to try to keep an open mind and try to go to a live one in a theater near by, where maybe I will be able to see what everyone is talking about.  The whole movie just left me bored and wasn't a movie that inspired my and my faith.  It was cheesy to say the least.
0545140315|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It is basically a story about teenage girls coming together when the boys they've been interested in leave them broken hearted.  The main character, Penny Lane, who was named after the Beatles songs by her somewhat fanatical parents is inspired to start the Lonely Hearts Club.      This is a well written story that really embraces the power of female friendship and puts into perspective how girls often give up their friends and other important things in their lives for the sake of some guy they like.  Penny Lane tries to keep to the tennents of the club even when she realizes she is falling for another guy.  Through the power of her amazing girl friends, she finds that it's possible to fall for the guy and still have your life and your friends too.  This book is definitely worth reading.

B0030BOCEG|5.0|Having followed and listened to the band since the 90's. I have to say Screamworks is yet another side of the same band. Sure some of the lyrics have a more hopeful side but like he Ville said...sometimes the light at the end of the tunnel is an oncoming train. It's melodic like every other HIM CD, it's dark like every other HIM CD, it's emotional and soulful, great singing, great musicianship (I's even say Lindstrom's guitar playing is maybe the best we've ever heard here on this CD). I guess I see it from a different angle...if you are a true fan you will like this for what it is - even if it's different (I remember people hating on Dark Light with this same nonsense I'm hearing with this CD - now they say DL was their best stuff?). C'mon people seriously if Tool had released 6 CDs of Undertow would I enjoy them as much? NO. If HIM released 7 CDs of Greatest Love Songs Vol. 666 would I have bought anything past CD 3? NO. Besides, regardless of anything else, as always, the lyrics are the best part of the music. Was always true in the past and is true on this CD. Valo is a genius. Also the acoustic CD is worth the price alone; very intimate and moody.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|I didn't really like \\"The Fame\\", Lady Gaga's first album. I'm not a huge fan of mindless electro-trance. A few of the songs were ok, especially \\"The Fame\\" (song), but other than that it was unmemorable. And in my opinion, Lady Gaga was unmemorable throughout the time the album was mostly successful. But then something happened and she changed from \\"crazed slut\\" to \\"hmmm, odd\\" and then suddenly to \\"one word: unstoppable\\".  Even 3 months ago I wasn't impressed by her, but right now she is my favourite artist in the world.  The Fame Monster is an extremely extravagant album, and is a 5 star one at that. Here's why:  1. The lyrics are out there, and also hold real meaning, and each song has a different story to share. Each track is like a great big novel wrapped into several minutes of music.  2. The artist hasn't forgotten the fundamentals of music - the music itself. Each song is rich, rich, rich with beautiful and catchy melodies. And each track has a different style to its music. You've heard nothing like this before.  3. Each track goes for over 4 minutes and despite the fact that there are only 8 tracks, it doesn't even matter.    Lady Gaga is now about delivering gold. She really cares about her music. She is a true artist, and it's refreshing that in this day and age of boring nobody's trying to shove themselves into the limelight, somebody can come along and steal their thunder. Somebody who DESERVES it.  They're saying Gaga is the new Madonna. Well I was never a fan of Madonna, but I definitely think she is the next big thing. She's one of those people who will be remembered for decades to come. Not because she was out there. But because her music was great. Is great.    She is a keeper and this album is insanely good. I literally love every track. Everybody I know who loves this album has \\"a Monster song\\". That is, one of the 8 tracks is their personal favourite. It's almost like if somebody names their favourite song from this album, I try and analyse theirdecision and what kind of a person it makes. Like good psychology. My favourite is Speechless by the way, which has got to be one of the most original songs written in a long time... possibly since My Heart Will Go On, or Don't Speak. It's amazing. Here's a list of my favourites in order:    1. Speechless (gold - this is really a heartfelt song, Gaga wrote it in desperation to her father as a plea to get life-saving surgery. Instead of a sappy ballad she's gone for a rock ballad and there are just no words. This song isn't favoured by critics, but they are foolish because it's instantly catchy. A future classic, popular or not. So many layers to the song - something I always love in songs. The half-way point marks a dramatic power infusion in an already powerful song, and it carries it all the way to the end. I can't rave enough about it.)  2. Bad Romance (big, long song with (again) many layers - it's almost like a song they would play to Greek Gods)  3. Dance in the Dark (not just a great message in the song about intimacy, but also a stellar tune - it could pass as a classic '80s tune, and if it becomes a single, who knows? Maybe it will be a future classic)  4. Alejandro (reminds me of \\"I Come From A Land Down-Under\\" with the opening bit, but this is a fun song, and also sports a really, really catchy melody)  5. Teeth (mad song, mad and unforgiving - there are times Gaga sounds like Aguilera, and this song sounds similar to the opening song in \\"Holes\\"; very powerful nonetheless)  6. Monster (a really powerful song, I honestly have no idea what it's about unless she is dating Frankenstein, but it is a full-blown electro-ballad with a hint of spice in the lyrics, and it just simply rocks)  7. So Happy I Could Die (I feel bad that this is second-last on the list, because it is such a great song, but this just shows how good the album is. Powerful and catchy)  8. Telephone (all about wanting to just let go and have fun instead of dealing with a pestering significant other - great chorus and would be good in clubs. Unlike Beyonce's brother-song, this actually has substance)    Hope my review was worth it. This album is just amazing. Not a single moment to dislike. I wish every song could be a single. I would love to see what she brings to it with her surreal video clips.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|Wow,<br /><br />I love this movie, anyone who has seen this movie and loved it and the scenery should see it on Blu-ray.  The colors and textures come so vividly to life.

B00003CWL6|1.0|Why doesn't anyone realizes the truth about this movie--that the makers of this film pulled the wool over everyone's eyes and managed to dupe the Academy into giving several Oscars to such an uninspired, pretentious film.

B001TK3XPE|4.0|Desmond Bates is, on the face of it, a recognizable David Lodge character--a hapless retired professor of linguistics at a fictional northern university--but both he and Deaf Sentence, Lodge's fourteenth novel in which he stars, are, while still funny, more melancholy than Lodge's previous work.    Desmond left the university when a departmental reorganization, along with his increasing deafness (which mirrors Lodge's own hearing loss), made retirement appear to be a good idea. Four years later, he is increasingly restless and plagued by physical problems. By contrast, his wife Fred is running a successful interior design shop; and having updated her appearance to befit an upscale shop owner, she now looks younger and more beautiful than ever. To Desmond, the eight-year gap between their ages--which hadn't seemed very large--appears to be an ever-widening chasm, exacerbated by the fact that he finds it more and more difficult to hear his wife.    Into this vaguely fraught situation comes Alex Loom, a graduate student working on the linguistics of suicide notes, whom Desmond has unwittingly agreed to meet. (The novel opens on Desmond pretending to follow what Alex is saying at a noisy and crowded party.) As Desmond becomes her unofficial thesis adviser, she is gradually revealed to be both mendacious and unstable, in a way that threatens to unravel Desmond's quiet existence.    As the pun of the title suggests, Deaf Sentence makes much of the humor of deafness. Blindness is tragic and deafness comic, Desmond explains, and there are a number of deeply funny situations in which he misunderstands what he is hearing. Milton's lament: \\"Oh dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon/Irrecoverably dark, without all hope of day\\" doesn't have quite the same pathos when applied to deafness, he notes: \\"Oh deaf, deaf, deaf, amid the noise of noon...\\"    But deafness is in fact tragic. Desmond speaks movingly of Beethoven and Philip Larkin's loss of hearing, and often refers to thesimilarity between the words 'deaf' and 'dead', in both wordplay and more serious allusions to the eternal silence that looms over him. Gradually, Desmond achieves a kind of acceptance of both.    Deaf Sentence is not all it could be: the Alex Loom story peters out rather than being resolved more effectively. But it is funny and profound and full of lovely and fascinating allusions to linguistics and art and literature; to my mind, it is Lodge's most successful novel since Small World.
0375842209|5.0|This book is brilliant- one of my favorites. It moved me to tears on multiple occasions. However, I must admit that after reading about 50 pages of it, I was totally bored. Disappointed, I put it back on my bookshelf, until a few months later when I had the wonderful opportunity to actually meet Markus Zusak and hear him speak. His talk inspired me to try reading it again. I'm so very glad that I did, because I soon fell completely in love with the characters, even the narrator-\\"Death\\". This book is definitely worth sticking with; to all you easily bored readers, keep with The Book Thief, you won't regret it!
0805091742|5.0|Many of the loftier things in life rest on surprisingly mundane details. Think of democracy: it's a very big idea, but can be undone by very small administrative errors. A few years ago in Maryland, a local election official forgot to put the cards needed for voting machines into the supply boxes for some polling places. Those polling places became fully functional hours late. In effect, this means that some people were disenfranchised. What that election official needed was a checklist.    In The Checklist Manifesto, Atul Gawande makes the case that most complex situations are helped by checklists. A well-designed checklist, as he envisions it (and as the brilliant checklist writers of Boeing envision it) is not exhaustive, but covers the most important and easily forgotten details of a procedure. Equally importantly, it fosters teamwork among the people performing the procedure, whether they are medical staff in an operating room, or an airline crew flying an airplane. It does so in part by mandating that all participants introduce themselves to each other, which not only creates a sense that they are part of a team, but can also embolden the less-powerful members to speak up when it's important to do so.    Gawande repeats the story of the Austrian girl saved from drowning that he told so rivetingly in his New Yorker article, and reveals that the hospital which saved her (in an extremely long and difficult series of medical procedures) had attempted to save drowning victims before, but had never succeeded: until they implemented a checklist, a detailed and well thought-out set of protocols for what should happen from the first moment when a drowning is reported.    The building trade is another example. Gawande describes how it has moulded itself in a world grown too complex to accommodate the traditional master builder system (in which one architect had control of all details of the building process). As he points out, it is rather miraculous that so many largebuildings manage to go up with so little incident. Builders achieve this, you will not be surprised to learn, through an elaborate system of checklists. (Gawande discussed this at the 2009 New Yorker festival. You can see footage of his talk here: [...].)    Gawande also weighs in on heroism in an increasingly complex world. The Miracle on the Hudson, as he describes it, was due not to the sole work of the captain, but actually to the teamwork of the entire crew -- which was guided by a set of checklists. Heroism, Gawande suggests, though occasionally the work of a single, inspired individual, derives more often from the disciplined teamwork of a group of people.    The Checklist Manifesto, though less focused on medicine than Gawande's previous books, continues his work of bridging the knowledge gap between medical workers and everyone else. He is also, as in his past books, quite ready to admit to his own failings. He confesses that he only grudgingly adopted a checklist in his own operating room (he didn't want to be a hypocrite), but now says that he has \\"yet to get through a week in surgery without the checklist's leading [them:] to catch something [they:] would have missed.\\"    Sadly, no matter how much evidence accrues for the value of checklists, Gawande describes an uphill battle in persuading other organizations to use them. It is to be hoped that this work will help change that.    This is an important book. It shows us how to do things, sometimes extremely important things, better, and that doing things better is not about what we think it is about. In fact, it is often vastly less glamorous and more mundane than we expect. In The Checklist Manifesto, Gawande shows us a kind of perfection. The kind of perfection achievable by flawed, disorganized, easily distractable human beings. It's a beautiful idea.
B001E95ZHY|5.0|THE ROCKER has been berated by a number of reviewers, one of whom stated something to the effect that Rainn Wilson lacks the substance to carry off his lead role.  As a 40+-year rock veteran, I respectfully disagree.<br /><br />OK.  So I disagree, and I'm NOT really respectful.  What do you want?  This is a fun film, meant to entertain, not to ride the red line on the raunch scale.  If you want a \\"rocker education,\\" read the book I'm writing on real rock road travel in the '70s and '80s.  Jack Kerouac couldn't cut it, folks.  By 1974, he'd have bailed out the side door of our red, unairconditioned Dodge Maxi-Van halfway between Memphis and Tunica, Mississippi, heading down Highway 61.  No Beat Generation road novel can capture what it was really like to wear the changes of the 1960s and gypsy your way through the '70s into position as \\"Top Band at The Varsity Club, just off Cherry Street in Helena, Arkansas.\\"<br /><br />But Fish gets it.  Wilson's performance in THE ROCKER embodies a sort of \\"blood knowledge,\\" if you'll pardon my quoting D. H. Lawrence, of a musician's paying dues with back-breaking work, too little sleep, way too much beer, and still loving it.  Trust me.  In the rock business, you never \\"work at nothing all day.\\"<br /><br />Spending years as a rock musician doesn't lead one to grow up, either.  My former band mates?  We Facebook.  We're all still \\"Fish\\" in one way or another.<br /><br />As THE ROCKER, Wilson captures the essence of Fish--of all of us--and brings him to life.  Let's not forget: THE ROCKER is a comedy.  Never growing up?  That's more in the tragedy line, but THE ROCKER addresses this magical Peter Pan stance, which few of us rock vets ever lose.  We're all crazy, and Rainn Wilson renders that mostly harmless insanity into something that even I can laugh at.  As one of my former mates always said of us rockers, \\"There's one good thing about being crazy.  You never have to worry about losing your mind!\\"  Fish is THERE.<br /><br />My only complaint about the \\"Born to Rock\\" edition is its exclusion of the complete bit with Pete Best.  Those few seconds mean a great deal to rockers of my generation. I've seen the out-take, and I wish it were at least set up as an a bonus feature on this DVD.  Even without that option, THE ROCKER: \\"Born to Rock Edition\\" still earns its full five stars.<br /><br />No, you won't find authentic rock word choice in this film.  You won't find the outrageous practical jokes bands play on each other just because they can.  THE ROCKER is not an X-rated venture into that world.  It's a comedy.  Remember the theatrical mask with the smile?<br /><br />If you're so slick that you're too hip to sit back and have a laugh with THE ROCKER, you might benefit from knowing that not all the musical \\"big fish\\" (pun intended) are decent players, singers, or songwriters.  Thousands of bar bands blast some of these acts off the stage.  Sure, the business is a \\"not what you do, but whom you know\\" operation.  Then again, sometimes you're too good not to be noticed. These issues, too, are addressed in THE ROCKER.  Me?  I was ahead of my time.  Doesn't matter.  I'm still rocking.  I'm still kicking butt. I'll never grow up, and I'll never have to worry about losing my mind.<br /><br />Yes, the real world, for real rockers, is \\"soul-crushing.\\"  THE ROCKER lifts that weight, even if only for a little while. Every performer in THE ROCKER does his/her share of that lifting.  Let go and laugh.  You'll feel better.

Not of a monster as many historians put him out as but of a man, a king doing what he thought was right to protect his legacy and his heart...... Anyways .... I truley enjoyed this book ... its a long read but a very well documentation of King Henry and his six ladies....
B000MRAAJM|3.0|I think my expectations were way too high. I expected some perfect picture quality and, at least, a normal regular sound quality.  Unfortunately, there are some issues with the Planet Earth.    The sound mix quality is the biggest problem and my family and I frequently had difficulties hearing the narrations behind the background sounds of animals, waterfalls, etc.      Also, the picture quality - at times - was low and full of visual artifacts.  I wasn't expecting this at all.    The movie isn't bad and will be of interest for many, but please be aware of the above limitations.
0545123267|5.0|OMG!  This story is good.  I loved how Maggie let us be in Sam's and Grace's head all the time.  We never had to wonder what the other person was thinking.  Truly a good love story. This is the latest craze among some of us Twilight fans.  I am expanding my reading to other authors and this story is just wonderful.      It's cute, adorable, and I just want to give Sam a warm hug.
1582701709|1.0|This book is pure NONSENSE and it reads as if it were written by adolescents.  The basic premise is this: if you think positive thoughts, positive things will happen to you.  If you think negative thoughts, negative things will happen to you.  This is philosophical snake oil.  Intelligent humans throughout the ages have observed that horrific tragedies befall the good and the just, as well as the ignorant and the worthless.      Oprah Winfrey has single-handedly ruined fiction through her apalling Book Club selections.  Even more disturbing, she is on her way to ruining spirituality (one of humanity's most important cultural and intellectul phenomona) with atrocious, ignorant nonsense such as The Secret.    It is amazing how much damage a few idiots can do in the world.
0439023483|5.0|Downloaded this book on my kindle by mistake.  Started reading and could not put it down.  A different kind of read for me, but well worth it.  The writing was superb, the descriptions(characters and scenes) actually let your see them, the plot very credible and most importantly unpredictable.  With too many books I have read lately, it has been easy to ascertain what is next and most of the time be correct; not so with this one.  I found myself rooting for the final team almost out loud.  I recommend it for fiction readers who want a new/different spin.
B0000256RB|5.0|If you're relatively new to Ayreon (all these other reviews are a few years old), then let me try to put some perspective on the music within this awesome 2-cd set: First off--I'm an old school rock fan from way back: starting with The Beatles,onto late 60's rock,onto prog giants of the early 70's (you should all know who those were)and onward into pop/rock giants of the lte 70's/early mid 80's,even some of the hair bands that came along later. King's X caught my attention in the late 80's early 90's. Since then it's been mostly searching out rock music with strong links to the past greats (I'm NOT a modern rock guy). Leave that to the youth...   Anyway-I recently was turned on to this Ayreon set. I'd heard the name,but never heard anything by them (him--being Arjen Lucassen & guests). Let me just say that if you're a fan of lots of different styles of rock,then you will ADORE this cd! ANd--it's a cool sci-fi story at the same time. I found that I was drawn in by the music almost immediately,while the story became more important as I learned to appreciate the entire set. Folks,this is a masterpiece (As some have already said here). You'll hear SO many influences here that your head may spin a little at first. BUT -and here's the best part..This is a grower,and gets better & better as you continue listening. I'll never tire of it-one of those rare cds you can always go back to and enjoy anew again & again. Yup--it's THAT good.    As I alluded to,if you like The Beatles,Kansas,Tull,Yes,Genesis,ELP,and many other elements of rock be it harder rock (even later stuff like Queensryche)or even softer,acoustic passages that are found throughout Into The Electric Castle--then absolutely hands down GET THIS CD!! The 8 different vocalists involved keep it a really interesting listen as well-male & female singers take the forefront throughout. It's a keeper,and you'll love it!     I've got a few of Ayreon /Arjen's other works as well All have their merits,but this is the creamof the crop. Some are heavier,some a bit darker/more modern,some even very Pink Floyd-ish. This cd combines all Arjen's influences in a seamless creation that tops them all! Get this now, & enjoy! T      PS: a helpful hint--if you like harder,more prog metal styles-try Ayreon's Flight Of The Migrator cd,or Arjen's Star One-Space Metal cd. If you like Floyd-then I'd suggest The Dream Sequencer by Ayreon. The latest cd is 10101001-a more modern,dark edge there,along with his newest project-Guilt Machine. Human Equation is quite the intersting,varied listen as well.Something for most/all rock fans in Arjen's work-depending on your personal tastes. He's a very gifted writer,for sure.
B002ZHKZEM|2.0|Much of the Tenth Doctor's era was classic. His first season was largely brilliant, his second had some terrific moments, and his third ... had its moments. Unfortunately, as the Tenth Doctor's tenure continued he got mired in angst and past continuity -- his third season was plagued with episodes that were more like bad fanfiction. The specials this year have been very disappointing, and this collection just isn't worth it.<br /><br />The episodes included here are \\"The Next Doctor,\\" \\"Planet of the Dead,\\" \\"The Waters of Mars\\" and the two parts of \\"The End of Time.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Next Doctor\\" is the best of the lot, featuring a great character in the \\"other Doctor\\" who would have been an excellent companion. Any drama the ending would have had is spoiled by the usual reliance on spectacle. Still, it's an okay episode and a lot of fun to watch.<br /><br />\\"Planet of the Dead\\" is ... eh ... it could have been an interesting psychological episode with different people stranded on an alien planet with a Doctor cut off from all his usual resources. Instead it was just a string of set-pieces with nothing really to offer. A very boring 50-odd minutes.<br /><br />\\"The Waters of Mars\\" is basically a retread of \\"The Impossible Planet\\" and countless other episodes. Closed military base, alien enemy that makes people paranoid, et cetera. Completely forgettable.<br /><br />And then comes \\"The End of Time,\\" another outlet for Russell T. Davies' fanfiction impulses and his obsession with romantically pairing off the Doctor. Bernard Cribbins as Wilf steals the show -- he's about the only one who ever gets to be interesting or entertaining, as the Doctor is snappish and MEAN, the villains are so over-the-top as to be comic, and the episode's big twist at the end is underwhelming.<br /><br />For a year that's supposed to be a spectacular send-off for David Tennant, it watches more like a list of the worst excesses of his era: style over substance, ham-fisted writing, and anticlimactic endings. Much was promised about the final scene, but even that comes off badly ... an out-of-character angry tantrum by Tennant the actor is followed by Davies indulging himself to the greatest degree yet in his obsession with retreading old ground in season finales.<br /><br />This set is really a massive disappointment for fans who might have been hoping something might redeem this era and bring it back to the heights of Tennant's first couple of years. I can hope that under Stephen Moffat's control we can get away from the Angsty Doctor, forced romantic subplots, and unfunny Catherine Tate Show humor (though at least that last is absent from these specials!) and back to the creative science fiction that was the series' hallmark before 2009.cene, but even that comes off badly ... an out-of-character angry tantrum by Tennant the actor is followed by Davies indulging himself to the greatest degree yet in his obsession with retreading old ground in season finales.

0307408833|5.0|Okay, so as a newer vegan I have been trying to create great frosting, as I love cake more than anything. I tried the smart balance, powder sugar, nastiness and that made me nauseous, so i was determined to find a new recipe. I have several methods of how to make frosting now, but I went into baby cakes in the lower east side a little back, and immediately fell in love with the lightness of the frosting. I also loved the idea that it was made with natural ingredients (coconut oil, like olive oil, has so many great properties, its fat your body needs) agave nectar (which is better than sugar, duh) etc etc. well I bought the book. yeah the ingredients are really expensive, but hey, we know its not cheap eating rare ingredients. anyways, i bought the book, the ingredients, and started making. well my frosting didn't work out. it was grainy and runny. tasted good though, but the texture was way off. i went online and found reviews that were pretty extreme saying erin was a liar and the recipes were fake etc etc. i really got bummed out and felt like i was had or something. i told my boyfriend we wasted so much money and was really upset. then i saw a reply by babycakes on a board saying if you need help write them at (...).unlike a lot of people i was determined to give them a chance and not give up, when was baking ever successful the first few times, thats the fun, trial and error. (sorry just watched julia and julie).  i wrote them my concern that night and emily (the general manager) wrote me back the next day, giving me tips and reasons why my frosting might not of turned out. well, i decided take the information, and what i knew about the products and try to save the already made frosting. I added a tablespoon more of coconut flour because in the book it said it was a great thickener. emily told me the lumps was because i added the coconut oil to ingredients that might of been cool because it hardened without mixing completely. I decided to heat the frosting overmed heat and stir until it became a liquid again, and stirred it really good. put it in the fridge to cool and it thickened perfectly. i think like anything new, you need to be patient and try until you perfect the art of it. and if you get stumped, ask questions, they helped me so quickly and were so nice that i can't help but feel i need to give 5 stars for their great customer service! if you want some other type of frosting ideas i have tried and had success with email me at (...) or if you want to ask about the frosting by babycakes hit me up.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Its hard to believe there are so many wonderful musicians on one CD. I first found out about this from \\"you tube\\"...love everything about it, from the African group to the Indian drummers, its just amazing to watch and listen to. Have to watch it in order to appreciate the music. Don't know why everyone hasn't heard of this music before now..Playing for Change..its the best. STand by me with Grandpa Elliot I could listen to all day. Its soulful, blues, jazz and amazing!
B002WY65VU|3.0|I love zombies.  Love the Dawn of the Dead remake, love, shawn of the dead, this movie had the vibe of both to begin with.  The first 15 minutes was awesome.  Smart, creative, funny, it had it's own style, the opening credits were just poetry (ultra slow-mo zombie attacks) but then movie hit a wall.  When the two female characters are introduced, from that point on, it feels like a different film from a different director.  The pace slows down (at times to a crawl, BM's mansion) it was painful.  The characters for whatever reason loose their smarts, and stop following their own rules to survival which was one of the main assets to the film and set it apart from others.  And the last half hour the `experienced survivors' are doing all the things that make you shout at the screen in bad horror films.  The first 15 to 20 minutes are great, the rest is pretty annoying cliché.

0743496736|5.0|This timely novel by Jodi Picoult proves once again why she is a topnotch best seller author.  There is nothing mundane about her writing style nor the topics about which she chooses to write.  I was planted firmly inside the mind of each victim, parent, and teenager involved in a condition becoming all too common in today's schools.  The twists and turns were horrific and realistic.<br /><br />I couldn't put this novel down even after I reached the end.  It was that powerful.
B002TYZKIM|3.0|This movie is a cultural \\"must-see\\": One interested in American Pop-culture should remain current on Michael Jacksons's curtain closing act. There are some semi-tear jerking moments, like in the beginning when the the dancers share their love for MJ.   One of my favorite moments of the film was the highlight on the badass blond bombshell who simply knows how to rule the guitar. Of course I'm speaking of Orianthi Pangaris. This movie-in my opinion-launched her career. Surely, for Orianthi this is NOT it...  I suppose I left the cinema a bit disappointed b/c I expected to see some family or personal commentary of the making of MJ's final tour. Alas, the film is more of a making-of documentary of Michael Jackson's This Is It tour.

0385504225|1.0|While the subject material of this book's philosophical discussions is a topic I find fascinating and I very much enjoyed the last two books in this series, this Dan Brown book was more painful than anything else. Written in movie scene-styled snatches, the characters played painful idiots to afford opportunities for excessively didactic dialogue throughout the book, the cliffhanger chapter ending technique was beaten to death, huge chunks of the book were needlessly repetitive, and for large portions of the book there was so much detail and description of slightly depraved acts or tendencies as to leave one questioning the author's own predilections. Is he just portraying what he views as evil, or is the act of writing about a character who glorifies in it so grotesquely an act of glorifying in it oneself?     The book maintained enough interest to make me follow it through to the end, but by about halfway through the book it was painful to continue and I almost stopped several times. I am glad to have finally completed it so I can cease being angry with characters for being so stupid and so that I am no longer spending my day being lectured at. And for all that, even though I like the message behind it, the final revelation wasn't even really worth it.    While parts of this book are interesting, overall I'd say save yourself the misery of wanting to finish it by not starting it. And I will be thinking strong thoughts about Dan Brown getting a good editor. Maybe if I concentrate hard enough it will become a reality.

I look forward to being able to buy Ponyo by itself on a letterbox format DVD. I hope enough people yell at Disney to tell them to get with the program. Put essentially the same content on all editions they produce.
1435248244|5.0|The protagonist in Uglies is Tally Youngblood; she is a fifteen year old ugly who is anxiously awaiting her sixteenth birthday so she can finally be pretty and join her best friend Peris who has already turned pretty.  In Tally's world everyone is born ugly and leave their parents home when they are twelve to go to school in Uglyville and live with other uglies.  When uglies turn sixteen they go under the knife and receive an operation that turns them pretty.  Tally meets Shay a few months before she turns sixteen; Shay tries to convince Tally to runaway with her to a secret society called the Smoke.  Tally decides she would rather turn pretty.  However, when Tally arrives to have her operation she is sent to Special Circumstances.  The leader, Dr. Cable, blackmails Tally into leading them to the Smoke; only then will they agree to turn her pretty.  So, Tally is given a tracking device, disguised as a pendant, and sent on the long and treacherous journey. Once she arrives she is suspiciously welcomed by the Smokies.  Tally falls in love with David, son of the founders of the Smoke. David brings her to meet his parents, previous doctors who performed the pretty operation, and they tell Tally why Special Circumstances really wants to turn the population pretty.  When Tally decides she doesn't want the life of a pretty and tries to destroy her tracking device she accidentally sets it off.  Special Circumstances arrives the next morning and captures almost all of the Smokies, except for David and Tally.  Tally and David end up breaking into Special Circumstances and find David's mom, Maddy, a now pretty and clueless Shay, and a few more Smokies. They steal important information about the pretty operation from an unconscious Dr. Cable and flee. Maddy uses Dr. Cable's information to finish a cure for the problem that the pretty operation creates; she wants to try it out on Shay, but she refuses.  The only way to find out if there is a cure is to have a volunteer consent to the treatment before they undergo the pretty operation.  Tally returns to the city in the last page of Uglies and asks for them to make her pretty.      This book is impossible to put down!  As a future teacher I would definitely use this book in the classroom.  It is a wonderful dystopian novel that could be read alongside books like The Giver and 1984 as a unit.  This is so much more than just a story; Uglies most definitely fulfills its purpose to make readers aware of what society can turn into when it allows the government free reign in trying to fix all the problems.  Only new, more devastating problems are created.  People no longer value themselves, instead they conform to a society that offers to fix their problems, in this case make them pretty.  Westerfeld uses an extreme example of the government controlling people to warn against the potential effects.  If I ever teach at the junior high or high school level I will make sure to include it in my curriculum.

0312370849|5.0|I read this book in two days, but not because it was a short, easy read. I was so gripped by the two tangled stories, that I had to read on to find out the fate of the two beautiful characters.    Each chapter switches from one character to the other and I found this great for many reasons. It helped to build each story in a way that made sense without jumping all around within any given chapter. It was a way to switch between past and present that made me realize the two times are not all that different afterall. And finally, it gave some relief when a chapter was so intense that I needed a breather so I wouldn't cry.     The story is dark and tough to face, but the author shines light throughout leving the reader with hope. Excellent book, one of my favorites in a very long time.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|I finally caught up with 2012 last night. Definitely a movie that needs to be watched with the brain disengaged.<br /><br />I'd heard so many bad things about this film I was undecided whether I should even bother. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Certainly, it's not a classic, and it could never be said to be thoughtful. But the visuals are stunning, and do more than enough to compensate for the cardboard cut-out characters and the generous doses of sugary homilies.<br /><br />It has been reviewed as a blockbuster, but in reality, this is a big-budget B movie. It reminded me of '50s classics, in particular When Worlds Collide, with which it shares several plot points. Seen as a film in this lineage it hits the spots it intended to hit.<br /><br />Several things grated. There's only so many last-second escapes from certain death one man can make before it just gets silly. And the gung-ho American bias became just -too- much when they had the President stay behind at the White House but showed the British Queen making her escape with the corgis. Don't people know that the Royal Family famously chose to stay in London during the blitz in WW2?<br /><br />The other thing that grates was the glib way that most of the world's population are killed. We're supposed to feel happy that a group of rich bastards have escaped and everybody else is dead?<br /><br />But the visuals are what this movie is all about, and the destruction of California, then Yellowstone Park, are very well done. The swooping flight scenes are spectacular.<br /><br />It needed more cutting, feeling about half an hour too long. Cut out some of the boring family business and they could have had a nice little disaster movie.<br /><br />In general, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. A guilty pleasure.
1595141715|5.0|I wanted to read this.  I had to read this.  A fiction book on teenage suicide and I was drawn to it.  I am so glad that I was.<br /><br />Hannah was in high school.  As this book opens, she is already gone.  As we enter the read. Clay has just received a series of tapes, 13 actually, that turn out to be from Hannah with instructions to listen to all the tapes and then pass them on to the next person as instructed.<br /><br />Clay, who secretly had loved Hannah from afar, is appalled that Hannah would record her reasons for committing suicide and wondered what he had to do with it.  In an almost addictive like manner, Clay begins to listen to the cassettes one after another and Hannah's story unfolds before our eyes.<br /><br />Told in Hannah and Clays voice, I found myself as addicted to the read as Clay was to listening to the cassettes.  It was hard to stop, knowing what was at stake.  occasionally I would get so caught up in Hannah's story, when it switched to Clay's voice I had to pull myself out and read parts again.<br /><br />I read this book in two days.  On the second day I didn't plan on sitting down and finishing the book but I just couldn't put it down.  Each tape, each chapter, each new character drew me in further..... who was it?  Was it one person who caused Hannah to finally end it all or was it a combination of people, of events.<br /><br />Hannah's story, while fictional, brings up a valid and important topic.  High school years are hard.  Within the pages of this book you discover that it is not one person or one event that sends Hannah spiraling downward.  As you read, while some of what happened to Hannah is hurtful, I didn't find where it was intentionally so.  No one in the story knew how fragile Hannah was.  Perhaps someone knowing would have changed the outcome, perhaps not.<br /><br />This book is a good reminder of how we treat others.  We never know where someone is coming from or where they have been. There is so much more to say about this book but I do want to spoil it for anyone.  All I can say is read it..  All I can say is read it.
B000021Y7X|5.0|The New Wave Era (mostly Late 70s) in rock music resulted in the introduction of a host of newly formed bands into the music scene. The music was simple, energetic, danceable and fun. Of all the bands, three stand out as strange departures from all the rest: Talking Heads, Devo and Pere Ubu. I own LPs produced by all three and I love the music. Then in the early to mid-80s, Talking Heads produced a movie of one of their concerts called \\"Stop Making Sense.\\" Some critics billed it as the greatest filmed rock concert of all time, perhaps in part due to the music but mostly for the way that the movie was put together. Of course, I had to see it during the first run and it was excellent. Wonderful film/concert! Well, now the original film/concert has been redone (re-mixed and re-mastered, as they say) and put out in the much more modern DVD format, Well, I waited a long time, but I had to have it.<br /><br />\\"Stop Making sense is a truly excellent video concert. I've never seen better. I was captivated from the moment David Byrne wandered out onto the stage and did his first song with the help of a portable boom box. Then it just got better and better as Byrne and his bandmates progressively joined in on the fun. And what fun it was! The energy released in this concert is just amazing. How Byrne manages to keep going throughout the whole concert is amazing in itself. He jerks and twitches, staggers around, runs around and around the stage, but never misses a note. He's always beautifully in step with his spastic performance. The other band members are somewhat less energetic, but close-up shots reveal that they're all sweating from the effort.<br /><br />The Talking Heads band, ordinarily a quartet including Byrne, Chris Franz, Jerry Harrison and Tina Waymouth, was supplemented by five additional musicians and all performed excellently. Perhaps it's just because I'm used to listening to their records, but I prefer the band as a foursome. Well, that's just my personal quirk. The band, as constituted, ran through a long list of Talking Heads songs and did an outstanding job. The sound was excellent and the visuals, such as they were, added to the performance. The movie seemed short. Maybe that's because I was enjoying it so much. A couple of songs were included as a bonus at the end and I felt it was too bad these weren't included in the concert film irself.<br /><br />Well, the film seems to have changed quite a bit from that which I remember from the mid-80s, but it's excellent. Quite well done! I loved watching it again and this is a DVD that I'll be able to watch again and again.<br /><br />Gary Petersonconstituted, ran through a long list of Talking Heads songs and did an outstanding job.

B00004RF83|4.0|Simply put, Lancaster's and Douglas's acting are enough to give this movie excellent ratings. The story line of course is very relevant to today's events where a pacifist President is in the office and the military is more hawkish. So, it is one of those few movies that will never age and will never get old or irrelevant. Basic story line is wonderfully directed and presented. I wish they had developed more on the Marine Colonel (Douglas) relationship with Ava (the woman in the scandalous relation with Gen. Scott). That'd have been better. And the abrupt ending was not what I expected. Sort of unrealistic and leaves the viewer in limbo. All in all, this movie is worth it. 4/5

0446569895|5.0|The moment I first received the book in the mail i read the back cover and side liner notes. As soon as I had time to start reading it, putting it down seemed to be very difficult. I took it to work with me that night and found myself reading it on every break and even during lunch time instead of eating. When I saw that my break time or lunch was over, I found myself not wanting to put the book away. The stories in Ozzy's words got me deeply imagening what the scenario would look like. I finished the book it what seemed like a short period of time. My only dissapointment is that it wasn't long enough, I would've gladly read the book if it had 1000 or more pages. A GREAT read for anyone and everyone.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|Well over a decade of touring behind his own music with his own band after years of being a \\"Hired Gun\\" (albeit a Hired Gun of *tremendous* talent and technical ability) for the likes of Frank Zappa, David Lee Roth, Whitesnake and others, Vai has taken a \\"cue\\" (if you'll pardon the pun) of his orchestral work with Holland's Metropole Orkest and disbanded his touring band that had existed with different players but the same format since 1995.  Even as a longtime fan, I had grown tired of *two* additional backing guitarists (with one doubling on keyboards and Billy Sheehan, an extraordinary bassist but one who very much plays as a \\"Bass Guitarist\\", virtually playing guitar lines an octave below) on-stage with Vai and therefore able to play the EXACT harmonies, overlapping parts, and generally sounding almost exactly like his studio albums.<br /><br />However, from his aforementioned scoring his music for an Orchestra and having a show recorded and released on CD & DVD (as Steve Vai: Visual Sound Theories) it appears that Steve felt the same way and for this tour set up an almost completely new band (only drummer Jeremy Colson and Rhythm Guitarist Dave Weiner were carried over) based around 2 violinist to better reflect both the orchestra sound as well as mindset: Ann Marie Calhoun & Alex DePue.  Both are immense talents and bring a vast musical change to Vai's music compared to his previous bands.  Each also has their own unique style that is captured beautifully on this release - Calhoun sounds much more classically-based and precise, whereas DePue has much more of a \\"Fiddler\\" aspect to his style and sounds far more wild and improvised.  Together they complement each other terrifically, and when either playing their own parts, doubling or harmonizing with Vai, or in their soloing they bring a new energy I feel was lacking in Vai's last several tours due to the sheer over-abundance of multiple *guitar* parts played as well as heard sonically.<br /><br />Special mention must go out to drummer Jeremy Colson and Bassist Bryan Beller.  As opposed to former bassist Sheehan's guitar-like style, Beller is much more a BASS PLAYER in both the notes he plays and the tone he uses.  Thus, his playing style creates a true \\"Rhythm Section\\" with Colson compared to Sheehan's playing far more with the guitars and not the drums.  This hardly means Beller is a wallflower in this band - with the complexity of Vai's music and bass parts, he holds down the bottom-end with the energy and technical precision that only a Berklee School of Music Honors Graduate can, and truly shines during the \\"Rock\\" songs that the Violins and Rhythm Guitar sits out and all three (Lead Guitar, Bass & Drums) can spread out in the legendary \\"Power Trio\\" format such as in the song \\"Juice\\".  On the other side of this, drummer Colson is frighteningly hard-hitting and yet capable of complex fills and time-signature changes while in lockstep with bassist Beller.  These two make a fearsome duo, and I hope Vai has the ability to use them whenever he tours next.<br /><br />...and then there's Steve \\"The Little Italian Virtuoso\\" Vai.  He combines a technical ability on the guitar that few, if any can replicate.  While I can understand how some \\"traditionalists\\" might be turned off by his wardrobe & guitar changes, on-stage persona and general \\"Showman\\" vibe, he's recognized that playing mostly instrumental pieces (he sings on a few numbers and does so well, but he's first and foremost a guitarist) indeed CALLS for his theatrics in the live venue.  It's a catch-22: if not, people would be complaining that it's a \\"boring\\" show full of technical music and little else.  Vai's on-stage playfulness, his banter between songs, and his love for music is clear and makes for a worthwhile show.<br /><br />On a technical level, this release is MILES above Vai's 2001 \\"Live at the Astoria\\" DVD.  The cost to shoot a fairly small-scale show has dropped dramatically between then and now, and the increase in the quality of Digital Camera and recording technology is readily apparent.  This show simply *looks* & *sounds* far better than his previous release and is much better edited as well.  His first solo DVD suffers from an overabundance of cheap and tacky low-budget \\"visual effects\\", the vast majority of which have been eliminated here, and when they do occasionally pop up they're at least much better looking and viewable.  For the Vai fan, \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" is the pinnacle of his craft, his art, and his ability to put on a really fun show!l Camera and recording technology is readily apparent.

B0025KVLRY|3.0|I did an experiment. I have 'The Capitol Albums Vol 1.' boxset released in 2004. The first 4 U.S. releases are in there, remastered, with stereo and mono cuts. I made CDs with all three cuts, the Capitols from 2004 and the 2009 Remasters. You can recreate 'With The Beatles' by adding cuts from 'Meet The Beatles' and 'The Beatles Second Album'. I then listened to the cuts one after the other, choosing from each group of 3 the best to my ears. Out of the 14 cuts that make up the 2009 Remastered 'With the Beatles', only 2 were superior, 'Till There Was You', and 'I Wanna Be Your Man'. 'Till There Was You' sounds better I think because it's a ballad with acoustic guitar prominent. I also found the 2009 Remasters worked better with ballads on the 'Please Please Me' 2009 Remaster. It seems that the rocking songs sounded better on the 2004 Capitol Boxset, with an almost even split between stereo and mono versions. Of course they're all superior to the dreadful 1987 releases.

B00022M518|5.0|Brian Eno is devisable by two: gentle ambiant experimenter and rock and roll reptile lunitic.<br /><br />Actually that is  part true, but overgeneralizing: If you listen to Here Come The  Warm Jets, or just look at song titles like \\"Needles In The Camel's Eye,\\" or \\"Baby's On Fire,\\" you get the second impression.<br /><br />Eno's fantasticly histrionic singing on some tracks here adds to glam myth he creates masterfully. When Yes sang about the \\"Heart of The Sunrise,\\" Eno wrote about, \\"The messenger of your doom and your destruction,\\" Blank Frank, who \\"speaks in incomprehensable proverbs, and is the air raid and the siren and the crator.\\" This is all in a Frankenstien vibrato, over Robert Fripp's thoridzine buzzsaw Les Paul.<br /><br />Such were the fun and craps game of 1973 bizzaro rock, when flowers in the hair were not going to work, and younger fans started dropping windowpane for kicks, not insight, and having free sex, not free love.<br /><br />But let's step back. Listen carefully, Hear what is really going on here. In every nutjob track, there is always a treated panio, an organ line that could come off a Terry Riely project. Eno may have nailed the charactor he wanted, but Eno the musician was dead on: inserting high art concepts into every wiedo confection. This is a man who composed using Tarot decks, Cagian chance concepts. Eno the artist is as fascinating as the cartoon monster he playing.<br /><br />By inserting art into the bizzare and the bizzare into art, Eno created layered masterpeices of rock and roll, modern classical, and rock theatre that was so good, you might not realize it is rock theatre. This is Alice Cooper with a PHD<br /><br />Brilliant.
B000001ESF|5.0|This is the one of Rush's best albums! It may go back all the way to the 70's but it is totally the definitive Rush album. The longest song I've heard is the best long song I've heard. 2112 overture opens up the album for a full 20 min of true rock and roll. Then the other songs, well they are the base work for Rush's later albums, old classic rock with a little bit of RUSH magic. \\"Something for Nothing\\" is a great song to close the album. If you like other Rush or old school rock, this is an album you'll want to have!
0385474547|5.0|*contains spoilers*<br /><br />I loved this book. Chinua Achebe writes a sad and melancholic tale about a man called Okonkwo in a small African tribal village called Umuofia. Okonkwo is a man feared and respected by everyone in his village and beyond. He is a wrestling champion and man who enjoys fame and respect because of his hard work. He is a self made man. His father was considered a looser because he did not work very hard to sustain his crops and did nothing else but play music and laze around. He died as an outcast.<br /><br />The only thing Okonkwo fears is failure and being compared to his father. So he works hard, becomes prosperous and lives comfortably with his 3 wives and children.<br /><br />But life is not fair to him. After working hard in his village to gain a title and a good life, he is exiled from his fatherland because he kills a boy by mistake. When European colonists come to his village and build a church and start converting the villagers into Christians, Okonkwo wants to take action, he wants to fight the Europeans and preserve his culture and religion and his gods. But no one else wants to fight. Okonkwo watches his son join the Europeans and turn into a Christian and he is in utter despair because he cannot do anything about it.<br /><br />This book has a sad and tragic end.<br />What I liked about the book was the simple descriptions of the day to day life of the people in a tribal village. I enjoyed reading about how their lives revolved around the growing and harvesting of Yams, how their beliefs in their gods affected the men and women in the village and their unease and anger when Europeans come and build a church in the village.<br />I enjoyed reading about folk tales passed down from generation to generation.<br /><br />Even though I like the book I would like to mention a few points here as I have heard a lot of criticism and bad reviews for this book.<br /><br />`Things fall apart' has been termed as a literary masterpiece. But if you looking for outstanding language, this book is not for you. The language is as simple as it can get, which I think is the beauty of it. If you want to clear your prejudice that African villages are backward and primitive and you think reading this book will give you an insight into why they what they do, do NOT read this book. I thought the tribal customs and beliefs were down right against humanity and whatever way the author would have put it, I wouldn't have believed otherwise. Would you approve of leaving new born twins in a jungle because twins are considered evil? Mutilating a dead infant's body so that it isn't born again? Out casting a man from his village and his loved ones because he has a disease?<br /><br />If you are looking for a good plot and well rounded and lovable characters, again this book is not for you. I hated Okonkwo. He was a tyrant and he repeatedly beat his wives and kids. I couldn't sympathize with him no matter what.<br /><br />I couldn't take sides with the European colonists either. Though they brought good things in the village, they brought law and order, I hated the fact that they thought their God was the greatest. Trying to undermine any religion is always wrong.

A garden that lives and breathes, a garden where fairy tales were written and secrets kept safe.<br /><br />When Nell was 4 she was left alone on a ship sailing from Europe to Australia. She was adopted by a man who found her all alone and couldn't leave her to fend for herself. When Nell turns 21, her father tells her the truth. Nell is devastated by this. After some years, before her father dies, he arranges to return to Nell the suitcase with which she had arrived. Based on its contents and a book of Fairy Tales written by Eliza Makepiece, Nell decides to find out who she really is. After Nell dies, her granddaughter Cassandra follows her grandmother's footsteps when she learns that Nell has left her a cottage in Europe as an inheritance.<br /><br />Essentially there are 3 stories running in parallel, Nell's search for her parents, Cassandra's search for her grandmother's past and finally the story of Eliza and Rose, where it all began.<br /><br />This was my first Kate Morton book and I was blown away by her writing and her ability to spin 3 complicated plots together. Al though at times I was confused with what was happening; overall it was a fantastic book. I wanted more of this book and considering it's almost 600 pages, that's saying a lot. Her writing is so beautiful that I found myself getting lost in the small sea side town, in Eliza and Rose's story and wondering how it all fit. I tried to guess the mystery a lot of times but was always wrong. The story I loved reading most of all was that of Eliza. She was so vivacious, rebellious and full of life.<br /><br />Kate Morton's writing is so evocative and her way of describing things is so beautiful that you cannot help but get lost in the story.

Beige slacks with grease spots clung to the marbles of his knees, twiglike ankles rose stoically from over-sized shoes, and tufts of white floss sprouted from various fertile spots on a otherwise smooth scalp. He looked like a character from a children's story. A fairy story.<br /><br />Some people might find the writing style very wordy but it worked for me.

B000050HTO|5.0|This is an outstanding CD by one of the legends in American.. Over the decades Bob Dylan has been one of the dominant figures on the American musical scene. I always remember Dylan making his comeback on the Johnny Cash  show. In the early 1970's in was able to attend his comeback concert tour with the Band. I will always be a Bob Dylan fan. This CD has every major hiy that Bob Dylan ever recorded. It starts with the early years with \\"Blowin In The Wind\\",\\"Don't Think Twice\\",\\"It Aint Me Babe\\",\\"Mr. Tambourine <Man\\",\\"Like A Ronning Stone\\",and A\\\"All Along  the Watchtower\\". The second CD has such hits as \\"Lay Lady Lay\\",If Not For You\\", \\"Knockin on Heavans Door\\"and the haunting\\"Hurricane\\". This is without question the greatest songs that Dylan has ever sung. Buy it.
B002VPE1B6|1.0|James really delivered a disappointing film this time around, which leaves me with the question of what the hell was he doing the past 10 years? Did he really think some of us wouldn't notice the stolen material from other films that he used in his movie. James STOLE already used ideas from Aliens, King Kong, Conan the Barbarian, The Matrix 3, Lord of the Rings and more. The robotic machine the marines use were already in the 3rd Matrix, James just added a cover to the machine. Almost every animals movements in the film mimic the animals in Peter Jackson's King Kong, which his Co. did the CGI but didn't change the movement patterns at all, the giant lizard in King Kong moves exactly like the giant cat in Avatar, no originality at all. In the movie when Avatars are gathering others to fight they arrive at a tribe call 4 winds in the desert, 4 Winds is the name of a GOD in Conan the Barbarian & happens to be in the desert also.  I'd also like to add that a book series and DVD series called AVATAR has been made since at least 2003 so James didn't create the name either. The list goes on & on. Bottom line is that this film was missing so many details that the CGI really couldn't make up for it, and your left looking at some pretty colors. The sad thing is alot of people like this movie, even though its pure garbage, they are just easily entertained. James had 10 years to write this movie & all he came up with is junk. At the beginning of the movie, we are told that the lead characters brother died from \\" being mugged for the cash in his wallet\\". 75% of our $ now is in computers, are you really gonna believe that we still use cash in 2125 ? So right away the movie starts off bad. If you wanna see a good movie of James's watch Aliens, cause Avatar is a BIG disappointment.
0385737424|5.0|When You Reach Me was one of the best books I've read in a long time. It was the kind of book you can't put down, you want to race through to find out the mystery, but at the same time you want to savor every word of this amazing author's prose. When I was 40 pages from finishing, I was already hoping the author was working on a sequel!<br /><br />It's an understatement that this book deserves the Newberry Award! Rebecca Stead, you are a genius. After finishing the book I wanted to hug you, then chat with you over coffee all about this amazing story, and how you came up with it!<br /><br />I truly never read a young adult novel that made me think so deeply, and that I related to so well (I mean since I was a young adult I guess!). Though I will say, Miranda- the narrator who is 12- is quite mature and smart for her age. She says things I've thought myself, or did closer to her age. All the characters in the story are so real and so relatable...<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who loves a good story... with a little bit of sci-fi, coming of age, 70s nostalgia, school days crushes and cold shoulders, and true heart... This book had it all.

Of course this one was released in 1970 and it set a format of hard rock with a dark edge that all that came later was to be influenced by.  The music is full of venom and drive and is at the top of what this type of metal should be. Although the next disc from this band (paranoid) would really take this spark and perfect it for the ages this one started it and on this version you get a second disc of unreleased songs. Except for \\"wicked world\\" which was on the U.S. version of this release already.  Seventies hard rock and metal was some of the best of all time in it's reliance on good songs and playing instead of growling or superfast riffing.  If you don't have this one then you want this version with the bonus tracks because it's got the rare versions.  This disc was also produced pretty much live in the studio so even the rarities sound pretty darn good too.
B002KWLUU0|5.0|Paddy McAloon has a box of unreleased recordings under his bed, and this release was one of them.  I would like to hear the rest of them, so I have to chime in here.  I'm AMAZED that  all of these reviews are not five stars.  The quality of the songwriting on this CD is absolutely stunning.  The recording quality is very good for a demo, which is what it is.  I'm beginning to think there are quite a few Prefab Sprout \\"fans\\" who really don't \\"get\\" Paddy, and are just waiting for him to re-release \\"Steve McQueen\\" over and over again.  Paddy McAloon is not a rock star, he's a genre-jumping songwriter who can make a darn good, complete sounding album all by himself.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|The info says that effects look cheap on this movie, that's not really the case it's got decent effects and the moon outside scenes actually look pretty good. The blu ray version really brings out these effects to good effect too. But Sam Rockwell puts in a incredible performance by any standard. This isn't a slam bang science fiction movie ( which are great too)  it's a intelligent thinking persons movie and It's very well done. The story is a good one and it  is not a slow movie at all. In fact this movie moved quite quickly for me. And Kevin Spacy really was able to make his character of the robot come to life. That's hard to explain but his voice acting was incredible. The robots actions made sense and even the main character comes to see that this machine is more humane than the men who placed him on the moon. I have no doubt that fully sentient machines will evolve in the future and we will by then see them as more than machine in someways.<br /> Kevin spacey and the people who designed this robot have really done things right. The director too; hopefully will keep on making more movies as he can really bring out alot of nuances in a film. This isn't a movie if you are looking for a action sci fi movie but it's story would do well on the now gone classic show 'the outer limits\\" (one of the few shows that both versions are highly regarded, the classic 60's one and the excellent 90's one). This show also was in my opinion easy to understand and to relate to and that helps.<br />Anyways this is a fine movie and it is a worthy addition to any sci fi fans library especially on blu ray.  This has a short film as a bonus and other features such as 'the making of' etc as well.  A good flick that is better than some a movies due to it's acting, and it shows how good a upper class b movie can be.
B002JM1VJG|5.0|To have the best of her music together in 2 DVDs is just amazing.I Love it. Happy to buy it directly from Amazon.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|I will start off by saying if you go with the straight download, then the production of this album could be better. If you change the equalizer settings to fit your taste as I did, then this is a kick-ass Slayer album. Most of the reviews I have read to this point are close and on point; but if you are a Slayer fanatic such as I--- then this IS for you! I don't break down the individual songs, but all are worthy of listening too. Download the album, add a bit more bass to the EQ and feel the drums beat through your chest. Overall a solid album by the Metal Gods but the production could be better. Thank the system for equalizers!
B0030V0PEW|4.0|This book piqued my interest, as checklists are common in my profession.  As a person in the restaurant business, our daily tasks are driven by completing checklists.  I was hoping to glean some insight in how to get people to actually use the checklist on a consistent basis or how to improve checklist design.  Instead, the two main points of the book were - use checklists and communicate with the team.  This maybe a startling relevation to the medical community, but it has been common practice in the restaurant business over my twenty years in the industry.  The book is well written and has an engaging story line about the development of the WHO checklist to reduce surgery mortality.    What suprised me the most is that apparently using a checklist to reproduce a successful environment has not been common practice in the medical profession.  I would advocate that those in the healthcare industry read this book and take the lessons to heart.  I will certainly be thinking of this book next time I visit a hospital!  If you already use checklists in your daily job, get this book if you want a good story, but do not expect it to add to your sum total knowledge on checklist design and execution.
B001IFZL50|5.0|I never write reviews but HBO did such a great job of capturing what life is like in that hellhole right down to stupid things like eating ripfuel to stay awake n complete the mission. I deffinitly recommend this for any marine whos been there or anyone who wants to understand what we went through over there.
0143038583|5.0|An essential book to inform and humanize us about our place in the food chain and the choices we have in the marketplace (perhaps the best way to vote). Pollard weaves a strand of his own story, affectionate and self-effacing, as he single-handedly bushwhacks the ways of our eating from paleolithic to post genetically modified. Tremendously researched passion and morality into a single meal (I mean book).
B000002HRE|5.0|Why all the hate on this album? ReLoad is one of my favorite records ever. Just think about it. If people would just stop comparing this album along with Load to their first four (or five depending on how you look at things) I bet you it would be much more loved. Just think about it, if this wasn't a Metallica record but it was the exact same, what would you think about it?    In any case, this has some of the heaviest pieces Metallica has ever done. Examples of this include \\"Fuel\\", \\"Carpe Diem Baby\\", and \\"Where The Wild Things Are\\" (the latter being one of my personal favorite songs ever.    Give this a try people. Listen to the whole album and pretend it's not a Metallica disc. You'll love it.
0307269981|5.0|I could chat about the lead character of this book, Lisbeth Salander, all day--she is that fascinating to me. She is hugely problematic, but also incredibly compelling and almost super-hero-ish(is that a word?) in her maneuverings and intrigues. I loved the first book of this series, and I think that I loved this book even more. I am looking forward to the third and final installment, but with a heavy heart, knowing that there will be no more...

B000JSI7AI|5.0|I was very surprised, saw a portion on cable and decided to buy and look at all of it.  It seems to address forbiden, but factual issue of today, hopefully it will help some of those who are confussed.  I did'nt think it was my type of movie, it was beautifull done.
B000002LRX|5.0|A fantastic follow-up to the masterpiece known as The Real Thing.  Funky is some places, hard core in others, Faith No More further defines itself as the protypical alternative ensemble.  Angel Dust is and will remain an essential piece to the alternative rock collection.
0316776963|5.0|This was the first book by David Sedaris that I read, and unfortunately, it now has become the book by which all of his other works are judged. I agree with the majority of the reviews that this is probably his best work. Each essay is funnier than the previous and it's easy to fly through half of this book in one sitting because you don't want to stop.<br /><br />It seems that most people either love Sedaris or don't get his style of humor. The punchlines aren't 'in-your-face' and require a bit of thought in order to appreciate. Put yourself in his shoes and you'll enjoy the essays even more. If you can handle the subjects and language, then essays like You Can't Kill the Rooster, The Youth in Asia, and I'll Eat What He's Wearing will leave you laughing and gasping for air... unless of course, you don't have the awesome sense of humor that you think you do... in which case, you probably won't be able to finish this book.<br /><br />Several months after reading this, I had the desire to re-read it, but instead bought the audio book, which is read by the author. It's a completely different experience, but hilarious to hear the stories straight from David's mouth. Whether you're reading it or listening to it, there's no wrong way to consume Me Talk Pretty One Day.<br /><br />If this is your first Sedaris experience, as it was for me, and you're hungry for more, I recommend Holidays on Ice as the follow up.
B002JIEYLC|4.0|This was the last of the really great Black Sabbath albums coming from their peak years in the 70's...In fact the album was not released in the US until the tour to support it was nearly over in 1975...there was turmoil during this time mostly with their oppressive management and Warner Brothers records, and then later into the next 2 discs where drug use was becoming a barrier to creativity....The only problem with it like alot of Black Sabbath's work is it is way to short. 6 songs with Iommi's acoustic prologues or a orchestrated overtures mixed in...Maybe an epic tune(Megalomania) that clocks in around 10 minutes, but the album is over before you know it.....Tony Iommi was taking over the mixing around this time and starting layering guitar tracks all over the place which seemed to cause agravation within the ranks.......<br /><br />But the material really holds up as mentioned before.....\\"Hole In The Sky\\" and Symptom Of The Universe\\" were concert staples and are today covered by most of the speed metal groups in one way or another....It is worth the price for anybody's catalog...<br /><br />Later in the 70's, TECHNICAL ECSTACY and NEVER SAY DIE, were mostly forgetable works...The last 2 tours to support these albums had Ted Nugent and Van Halen opening for Sabbath and stealing the spotlight each gig....Ozzy would get canned and the whole thing would change later on into the 80's.
B002YIHO7I|2.0|Common Sade, after all these years of waiting for another spectacular LP/CD to come out, this was the best you had to offer us.  As a music scholar and professional entertainer, I find this effort laxing any momentum to even care to do a good job.

Alas, Larsson lived to write only two other books before his early death, and one of those is not yet avsilable. The Swedes and Danes seem to be taking over the mystery market with their fresh, new characters and plots. You'll remember \\"the girl\\" for some time after finishing the book.

B002WY65VU|4.0|\\"STAY ALIVE\\" So are the immortal words of Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) as he tells us how to survive the zombie apocalypse. In college when the zombies took over America, Columbus is now trying to make it back home to Ohio to see if his family is still alive when he runs into Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a man who excels at killing zombies and just wants a twinkie. In Tallahassee's search for a twinkie, they run across Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin). With the new girls running the show, they all decide to head west to Pacific Playland, a place supposedly free of zombies.    When Shaun of the Dead came out in 2004, written by the guys behind Spaced (if you haven't seen that show, I highly recommend you check it out), it was a breath of fresh air. Recent spoof movies didn't now how to be cutting edge and funny at the same time, but Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg knew how to make an homage correctly. It was only a matter of time before Shaun of the Dead brought forth copy cats. If only all copy cats could be this good!    Zombieland is one of those rare instances where a movie comes out being nearly as good as the movie that inspired it. Like Shaun of the Dead, it can't really be said that Zombieland is truly a spoof as much as it is a comedy that involves zombies. This time they're not the slow moving zombies that inspired Shaun, but they're the fast moving zombies that we've seen more of in the remake of Dawn of the Dead and 28 Days Later. This is important because where Shaun of the Dead was a little more old school, Zombieland tries to give it's story more current flourishes like those seen in more recent indie movies. It gives the movie a nice original narrative feel, but at times can be slightly distracting.    The acting in this movie is superb. Despite the indie flavors of the movie, this film really helps break indie darlings Jesse Eisenberg and Abigail Breslin into the mainstream. Woody Harrelson, though, steals every scene of the movie he's in (with the exception of a brilliant cameo late in the second act of the movie that I'd rather not give away at this moment). Harrelson gives the movie a little bit of an old school hero flavor with his quiet hero, but also has something in his past that gives him a rounded out character to play.    While the movie is great, in the third act of the movie some of the characters make really bad decisions that propel the movie forward. Of course, this brings out the \\"damsel in distress\\" portion of the movie that seems to be seen in a lot of movie. It's unfortunate too, in a movie that does so well at being somewhat original in it's premise to nearly fall apart by lazy writing in it's final act.    All in all though, I'd highly recommend this movie. It's still surprisingly refreshing to see a movie that is genuinely funny while still paying great homage to it's predecessors. If you like zombie movies, dark humor, or Shaun of the Dead, you'll probably like this movie. Trust me, give it a shot!    4/5
B002UZXJA6|5.0|What a fantastic experience.  The songs are great, the staging is great, and of course, the girls are phenomenal.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend as a birthday gift and he just loves this box set. It was delivered in a reasonable time and came in a nice metal case with the dvd's neatly cased inside.  He was impressed and so was I. As for the Blu-ray experience, lets just say that with the surrond sound system and HD t.v. he has, one would feel as though they are almost there. It has some pretty intense moments that really make a person feel for the men and women.   Overall it is a very nice box set and a great gift.
1580176941|2.0|I purchased this book on the basis of the many very positive reviews it received.  The cover cookies are lovely, and there are some other very nice photographed groupings of decorated cookies.   Showers and Weddings is pretty, for example, but nothing very original.  Elsewhere, it seems to me this book tends to be more about quantity, not quality, and I didn't find many new ideas here at all.    However, my biggest bugbear, is that about half the techniques/illustrations in the book are hand drawings, the style of which I find completely unappealing/very dated.  There are sequential decorating instructions, but not a single series of step-by-step photographs as I had expected, and some of the cookies do not look too professional to me - e.g. on the sleigh the main outline piping outline is crooked and looks like it has fallen off the edge in places.   I am just an amateur baker but there was little here to inspire me, and I have no idea why this book got such enthusiastic reviews.  Had I seen it beforehand I would not have bought it.   Overall, very disappointing.

B001AVCFK6|4.0|I wasn't quite a treckie when the original star trek was on but I never missed an episode. They held to originating themes pretty well even getting in the Kobayashi Maru and the way Kirk beat it into the movie. There were a couple of things that they missed for example they killed off Spoc's mother and in IV she gave Spoc advise so they did not hold there. In all I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would recommend it.

B002XMGGK6|4.0|I was worried about this one, based on the \\"professional\\" reviews. But it turned out to be compelling, thought-provoking, and just plain entertaining.<br /><br />You know the plot. The critics called this \\"a nasty piece of work\\" and so on. Well, there is nastiness. But it's not just the violence (most of which is off-screen and implied). It's the nastiness of the justice system. This is the movie version of \\"The Death of Common Sense\\" - the criminal-friendly, evidence-killing justice system that allows murderers and rapists to go free based on technicalities, forcing prosecutors to make deals to gain silly \\"wins\\" is the \\"broken\\" aspect on display here. Any sane person can readily see the two warring sides of this coin, as shown in the movie - the injustice of the system and the workarounds necessary. By the end of the movie, no-one's worried about Clyde's civil rights anymore - the lesson he intends to teach. (And how he does it is a doozie.)<br /><br />Despite the fact that his agenda spills over into semi-innocent blood, I found myself rooting for Clyde the whole way through. This is what made the critics queasy - they found themselves rooting for him too, despite their criminal-friendly, respect-their-rights-above-all-else sensibilities. (Well, unless they're the victims, in which case we often find they're hiding guns in every corner of their own houses. See Carl Rowan, et al.) Because the \\"innocent\\" victims also knew that they had, in some measure, brought this on themselves. Is it unfair? Perhaps; but then again, they were just working within the crazy \\"progressive\\" justice system. The question the movie asks is, when do they start respecting the rights of the victims more? (I don't mean the race-driven travesties of the Tawana Brawley or the lacrosse cases.)<br /><br />The anti-Bush, anti-Catholic-church guy who flew his plane into an IRS building (oops, didn't your newspaper give you that information?) is another disturbing example. Although we are repulsed by his final act, reading his screed we can certainly be digusted with a system (in this case the IRS and Mr. Moynihan) that can arbitrarily continually crush a hard-working engineer just trying to get the same breaks that Timothy Geithner and his peers do.<br /><br />These are disturbing questions that should not arise in the minds of \\"regular\\" folk like us. It provokes thought and even critique. Thought is not allowed in certain circles, only assent. This movie cracks open the door a little too much for comfort.<br /><br />It was fun, and it was too short.g his screed we can certainly be digusted with a system (in this case the IRS and Mr. Moynihan) that can arbitrarily continually crush a hard-working engineer just trying to get the same breaks that Timothy Geithner and his peers do.

B0015ABRE2|4.0|4.4 stars<br /><br />I enjoyed this more than the second season, mainly due to the entire arc with Smits. He works well with Hall and some of their scenes together are excellent. But as before, I find the side plots with the other actors less and less compelling.<br /><br />Carpenter just doesn't impress me much; she could easily be in any other boring typical cop show out there, ditto for most everyone here except Hall, who continues to carry the series along with the very good writing. Angel seems to be the only one here truly progressing as an actor, and his scenes are the pick of the non-Dexter litter.<br /><br />I must say, however, that this was the season where I finally realized how sick this series and my/our love of it is. Seriously, folks. How mentally ill and numbed to violence are we now that we can watch the increasingly graphic murders on this show and be entertained by them?<br /><br />It hit me when Dexter is with Prado as he murders his first victim in the kill room. Whereas in the first season we got mostly visual suggestions of the brutality, in a much more artistic and Hitchcockian way, now the producers are making straight out snuff films. Watch the camera when Prado stabs the guy; it shows the knife go right in to the hilt, then it show Prado's almost orgasmic glee in murdering this guy, and then it pans to Dexter's grim smile, as if to say, isn't it fun to kill people?<br /><br />I had a sudden queasy feeling when I saw that, and it hit me pretty clearly how sick I and we have become when our weekly entertainment is watching carefully-made pictures of the joy that a murderer feels. The moral compass of this show seems to mirror our own capacity for ever more brutality; the more you get the more you want.<br /><br />Just like pornography. That is in fact what this show is becoming: death porn. In their desire to show the inner workings of a killer, they have realized that this format will let them make weekly snuff films, however blase, and each season they are stepping up the intensity of the graphic murders. The ratings are just rocketing, though, so all must be well.<br /><br />And we sit back and eat popcorn and smile as people are carefully disemboweled on screen. Is this not sick? I think it is, but just like the boiling frogs we have been lowered into this cauldron slowly over the decades until we accept that this is entertainment. At this rate, how long until we broadcast capital punishment via pay-per-view? Or simply stop caring that as a nation we have become inured and numb to murder and torture?<br /><br />Speaking of which, isn't it time for our greatest killer, Dick Chainysaw, to appear on this show and kill some folks along with our hero Dex? How awesome that would be. \\"They deserve it, Dexter. We are Good, and they are Bad. This is Justice.\\"<br /><br />And of course, I will now get comments from the (always bravely anonymous) fanboys about how this is just a tv show, and don't be such a wimp. Yet I find it more than coincidental that as tv gets sicker and sicker, we are increasingly unconcerned by our government killing and torturing people, all in the name of Justice.<br /><br />In the end, that's what lets them get away with this show: Dexter is killing bad people! They deserve to die! And we want to see them killed as slowly and brutally as possible.<br /><br />So who's really sick? Maybe it's we as a nation that need to be laid out and tied down on Dexter's killing table, with pictures of the millions of innocent people our tax dollars have killed while we look the other way, from Cambodian carpet bombings to Langley-remote-controlled drones that may be murdering yet more innocent Pakistanis this very moment.<br /><br />And then Dexter will say, \\"It was never enough, was it? You needed ever more resources, ever more markets, so you could live your detached, pseudo-comfortable lives free from thinking about how many innocent people died to create that fake world of Fake comfort. All soyou could sit in your living rooms and watch tv shows about how murder is really not so bad...as long as you kill the right people.\\"<br /><br />But hey, I'm just kidding.<br />Let's just relax, and be entertained.t so bad...as long as you kill the right people.\\"     But hey, I'm just kidding.   Let's just relax, and be entertained.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|An entertaining space mystery, horrifying yet genuinely moving. Kevin Spacey is great as this film's version of HAL.<br /><br />In the future, most of the Earth's energy needs are met by one corporation mining some wonder material on the moon. The protagonist is the sole human operator needed, scheduled to be rotated out soon.<br /><br />On a trip to check out a mining location, he has an accident. This sets off a strange cascade of events, which he has to unravel to understand his situation. And it's a doozy.<br /><br />Production values and effects are good enough, Rockwell's performance is great, and the whole thing is worth a watch or two.

B000PMGS8G|5.0|So why the 5-star review, you might ask?<br /><br />There is just something about this movie that I can't put my finger on.  The actress playing Dale Arden (sp?) is painfully bad, especially during the football fight scene where she claps her hands, joyfully egging Flash on with \\"Go, Flash, go!  Go, Flash, go!\\"  Topol (Fiddler on the Roof) is over-the-top as the mad genius scientist who is the only one on Earth to realize that all of the natural disasters are a direct result of an alien attack.  Max von Sydow plays his villainous role as Ming the Merciless with \\"muhahahahaha\\" glee.  Timothy Dalton doles out his dalliance as Prince Barin, ruler of Arboria.  Brian Blessed is priceless as Vultan, leader of the Hawkmen; how he got through the enitre movie wearing what had to be uncomfortable (and very upsetting) leather shorts is admirable.<br /><br />The effects are cheesy (although, at times, brilliant - The Sea of Fire near the beginning is still eye candy for me).  The acting is campy.  The drama is laughable.<br /><br />So why does it continue to fascinate me?  Despite its horrible trappings as a stand-alone movie, it truly is an embodiment of the Saturday morning serial (which Star Wars PROFESSES to be, but has degenerated into a contest of making something fake look real).  With THAT in mind, the movie plays out as good, cheesy campy fun and always has you wondering how the hero continues to cheat death in a nearly 2-hour movie (as opposed to the next weekly installment).  The matter-of-fact discussions about Earth's imminent destruction, our hero and damsel-in-distress somehow instantly falling in love and the inexplicable onset of early jealousy after having only traded about 10 lines of dialogue, the sometimes brilliant lines of dialogue delivered by Max von Sydow (especially how he discusses with Zarkoff why it's HIS fault that Earth is being destroyed), etc., brews an unusual beverage of serial episode fun that was purely misunderstood back when this was released.  That, and what has to be one of the most unusual (and quite good!)soundtracks by Queen--especially the In the Space Capsule theme--has me coming back and watching just another curious addition to a catalog of Dino de Laurentis films.

1439170045|1.0|Why only a single star?  Who is going read one more 5-star review when over 80% of the hundreds of reviews have the highest rating?    Still Alice is an interesting and terrifying book on the thoughts of a person with early-onset Alzheimer's disease.  Dr. Lisa Genova not only knows her subject but has the ability to translate it effectively into words.  For a first book,  she clearly has a gift.    What attracted me to Still Alice was my father.  He did not have Alzheimer's disease but another brain disorder known as Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, PSP.  Over a year ago, my sister's reading club read the book, and she recommended it to my wife.  That recommendation was followed up by another from my wife's colleague who teaches English.  My wife finally purchased the book last year, but it got stored on a pile of other books to be read.  When I was looking for something to read, I noticed Still Alice on the book pile.    The summary discussed Alzheimer's disease, which immediately struck a fearful note.  However, I opened my Kindle book reader to see if there were reviews.  I was surprised to find hundreds of reviews -- most with the highest rating.  At a minimum, I thought that the writing should be good, but I was very ambivalent on the subject.  On one side, I wanted to learn about the thoughts of one going through such a horrific disease, but on the other, the topic resurrected a fear of coming down with something similar.  While PSP is not Alzheimer's disease, it is a mixed bag of Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's.  Watching my father deteriorate, from a healthy 65 year old man to bedridden mess of uncontrollable body functions when he passed away at 77, was heart wrenching.    Despite my fear, I plunged into the book and found it very rewarding and easy to read.  I would agree with the majority of the reviewers:  Lisa Genova is a good writer and the topic is timely and needs to be discussed.  However, the readers are let off easy.  Despite the factthat over the two-year period of the book during which Alice deteriorates from a fifty-year old intelligent and respected university professor to a person who cannot remember her own children, the ending is somewhat happy.  Alice is surrounded by a group of friendly people and children, which she enjoys immensely.  Those nice people just happen to be her family and her grandchildren!  Unfortunately, the true end I will guess is not as happy.  As more neurons that control body functions die, the final outcome must be very tragic.      Dr. Genova's statements about misdiagnosis are right on, and I believe apply to any cognitive affecting disease.  For the first five years of my father's affliction, my sisters swore that my father was a closet drinker, which caused him to constantly fall and go off by himself, getting lost and having accidents.  One time, it took two days to find him when he wrecked his car and sat there lost for a day.   I agree with Alice's thoughts that having a body riddled with cancer leading to death would be much preferable than Alzheimer's disease that robs us of self.  I can definitely understand the contemplation of suicide.     This book is surprisingly good for a first-time writer.  It opens a window to a very devastating disease and give us a terrifying glimpse into the world of an Alzheimer's carrier and how the disease affects family, friends, community, and society.  The term \\"Truth is Stranger than Fiction,\\" certainly applies to Still Alice.  I hope a cure is found very soon.  In the meantime:  Read this book!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Wes Anderson likes to make fun of the human condition, and he sorta succeeds here...altering a few obvious details. With the great Noah Baumbach, he has scripted one of the most amusing and entertaining films I've seen in years. This animated film is old school, naturalistic, and very reminiscent of the classic animated films of yore.A little known tale by Roald Dahl is presented, voiced by George Clooney, Meryl Streep, Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, etc., with a charm and originality that can't be compared to other Dahl tales on film. It's nominated for 2 Oscars, and I think it should win something, but the criteria of the Academy is not the same as us, the general public. I enjoyed \\"Up\\" a lot, but I enjoyed \\"Fantastic Mr Fox\\" a bit more. Both are fine films. Both are exhausting, regarding plot. Both have cynical reparte&eacute;, but \\"Mr Fox\\" had characters that were sillier and funnier. Alexandre Desplat's Oscar nominated score was appropriate on all levels. I simply enjoyed this film a lot.

B002WCLG3O|1.0|Just got through watching the entire disc from beginning to end.  As my title indicates, this is a terrible animation addition to the Halo universe.  Just watching the stories from beginning to end was challenging enough.  After every episodic disappointment, I continued onwards to the next in hopes of some sort of redemption.  This is only the 2nd animation addition I've ever owned (The Matrix animated series was the 1st) and I have to say... either Matrix made an unbeatable companion series or Halo Legends is just straight disappointment.  Having watched anime for the better part of my entire life, I'll defer to the disappointment option.    I don't know what to say, really.  This is Halo for crying out loud.  Soldiers, aliens, space, and bugs.  How much more open can you get?  How difficult is it to make a couple of good animated episodes?  I'm not going to complain too much about the voice acting (although that was pretty terrible too) since it was clearly made for Japanese.  However, the stories and animation themselves were so poor that I wondered if there was any oversight of this production.  I honestly cannot believe I did not find a single episode I would watch again.  Batting a .000 is pretty amazing now-a-days when there is so much creativity out there coupled with an unbelieveably strong Halo market.  Disappointing, indeed.    Save your money and your disappointment.  You would find better creativity in playing Halo online and making up dialog after watching your recorded moments.

B001DCQI8W|5.0|A previous reviewer suggests purchasing this set as part of the integral Karajan Symphony Edition [[ASIN:B001DCQIAU Karajan: Symphony Edition]], and frankly if I was starting to build a classical music collection I would agree with him. But with several decades of listening and collecting to music, the symphony edition was not my first choice. I always felt it was hit and miss with Karajan. All too often, I found his interpretaions overly polished, technically beautiful, and ultimately boring. Particularly in his later recordings of Beethoven and Brahms.<br /><br />There were, of course, exceptions. I owned EMI studio CDs of his Bruckner 4 and 7 symphonies that I enjoyed a lot, and his last Bruckner 8 is universally acknowledged as reigning supreme. His Strauss Death and Transfiguration [[ASIN:B00000E2OB Strauss: Metamorphosen/Tod und Verklarung (Metamorphoses/Death and Transfiguration)]] is astounding, as is some of his Mahler. But truth be told, he was never in my personal top tier of conductors. Then of course, there was his political past - but I won't digress.<br /><br />I also came late in the game to Bruckner. Aside from the aforementioned recordings, I really don't own too much Bruckner - finding him somewhat bombastic. I really had to be in the mood for those inevitable blasting brass choruses. The 4th, 7th (HvK Berlin '71, Walter) , 8th (HvK Vienna), and several 9ths (Giulini, Walter). Bruno Walter - he was such a gentle affectionate conductor, wasn't he? I discovered Mahler in college through Walter's recording of the 1st symphony, and later Bernstein - but again, I digress.<br /><br />Then, several months ago, I decided to fill in a gap in my collection by purchasing Jochum's box set of Bruckner's Masses and Music for Sacred Works for Chorus [[ASIN:B00000E3XV Sacred Works for Chorus: Masses 1-3; Te Deum; Psalm 150]] NOT the DG re-issued two-fer sets which apparantly feature quite a bit of digital glare, but the original release. I was stunned by the beauty of these works - most of which I had not previously heard. (One night I put on Mass #2, and my wife, a trained mezzo said \\"This is beautiful - what is it?\\" She was quite surprised to learn who the composer was).<br /><br />With that in mind, I decided that perhaps, at this point in my life, I was ready to re-explore Bruckner. (We DO hear music differently at different points in our lives. When I was a younger guy getting into all of this, I loved almost all of Georg Solti's recordings. Now......) So - which cycle to buy? Common consensus, and a great Used/Like New price convinced me to give Karajan a shot. Let me just say that I really, really enjoy this set.<br /><br />The interpretations \\"flow\\", they make sense; they don't seem episodic - something that can plague Bruckner. Listening to symphonies 1-9, you hear the musical arc of his compositional life. I was surprised to hear how many of the noted Brucknerian trademarks were in place, so early in his career. I really enjoyed discovering the first three symphonies. They were actually quite lovely, and not nearly as insubstantial as I had read during all these years. While the performances of the 4th and 7th may not displace my fondness to the earlier EMI studio discs and later Vienna disc of the 8th, those performance too - discs in booklets - are slipped into this same collector box - savings a bit more of shelf space, and keeping my HvK Bruckner together.<br /><br />As for the sound quality, I find myself caught between the two camps. DG's early digital recordings were notoriously poor - digital glare, harsh strings and such.  These recordings don't seem as bad as I remember some other early discs, but then again I recently replaced my CD player with a well known British unit which is making my entire collection sound better. So perhaps its just extracting a bit more data and converting it with greater accuracy. Anyway - they sound good to very good, though not great. I agree with Santa Fe; there is still some digital glare and harshness in the climaxes. As for the bombastic brass I alluded to, well, those climaxes sure are thrilling if you're in the mood to hear them. But the congestion is there - these recordings are not state-of-the-art. For some reason, the sonics seem to be most of a problem in the recording of the 7th Symphony; congestion in those tuttis (oh, those tuttis!) and the second movement sounds a bit muddy - but maybe I just have a stronger \\"aural\\" memory of the earlier EMI recording. Sante Fe nails it in his earlier review, noting Karajan's absolute command of the musical structure of this symphony. Bottom line: these sonic concerns are very minor. Hear the music contained in these discs. Some of the performances seem revelatory to me. This performance of the 7th is one of them.<br /><br />So then - if you need to add some heft to a burgeoning classical collection - go with the Karajan Symphony Edition. But if you're in a place to be a bit more selective, and really don't need another middle of the road Beethoven or Brahms cycle, give this set a shot.  I'd suggest listening to Rattle's recent Brahms Cycle - yes Rattle - for performances that are extraordinary both in terms of interpreation as well as sound [[ASIN:B002AGIEYG Brahms: Complete Symphonies]])<br /><br /> I'm quite certain that I will be listening to this set often. I also know that I will be enjoying it - and learning from it - for many years to come.As for the bombastic brass I alluded to, well, those climaxes sure are thrilling if you're in the mood to hear them.

0307387178|4.0|I was stunned by the movie and quickly went on-line for further info. Wikipedia was helpful but when I finally read the original article from [[ASIN:B00005N7S2 Outside]] magazine I knew I had to get the book.  I have to admit that, as with any article turned book, it had its fair amount of puffery. For me, however, it worked. As a young man myself, I empathized with both the character and author's views on life in the USA; and then as a new father of a son I agonized over the character's original and pseudo families throughout. You should only read if and when you have time to reflect.
B00003CXBH|5.0|For starters cinematographer Chris Menges' work here ranks with the greatest of all time.  How he captures the beauty of the South American landscape is at once mesmerizing and breathtaking.  Ennio Morricone's score is downright ethereal ranking with his masterwork in Sergio Leone's \\"Once Upon A Time In The West\\".  Menges captured Oscar gold but it eluded the maestro losing to the score for \\"Round Midnight\\".  Their collective contributions not only serves the film but acts as a Greek chorus to the action on screen.  The film's critics gave grudging respect to their work but dismissed other aspects of the film.  Most notably their barbs were directed at Robert Bolt's script stating that there was a predictability to it and a certain inevitability to the film's conclusion.  The response to that would be there is a basis in history here and it doesn't always end the way we like it.  I think their missing the point in that the missionary work of the Jesuit priests on the surface may appear to be doomed but their actions live on in the hearts of the natives most notably the youngest.  This is a difficult sell to challenge your audience this way and kudos should go out to both Bolt and director Roland Joffee for tackling such ambitious material.  The film is anchored by terrific performances by Jeremy Irons as Father Gabriel who practices reason and nonviolence to persuade the Spanish and Portuguese colonists not to dismantle the Mission and Robert DeNiro as Rodrigo a mercenary turned Jesuit priest who feels agression should be met with agression.  Most impressive is Ray McAnally as the Pope's emissary sent to mediate the dispute but with a heavy heart must side with the colonists because of the internal politics in Europe.  This is an extremely thoughtful film that will resonate with you for a lifetime.

B0015DROBO|5.0|I aim for entertainment in book.  It must also be well written.  This book had it all.
B002XMGGK6|1.0|There is some chatter online about the premise of this movie, but what is it really? Kill or be killed? Its what it seems to suggest to me. This movie (unintentionally) might be the most nihilistic movie in recent American cinema history.  Really, what this movie was about was not the illogic of \\"the system\\" or even vigilante justice, rather subtextually was about the madness of humankind, unfortunately the movie's makers didnt see it that way. Im not sure if the problem with the movie rest with the script or the directing but somewhere along the way it got compromised, what should have been a dark psychological thriller about individual necessity and the pleasure principle, instead became an action thriller, with an attempt at social commentary and cardboard cutout characters whose motivations are well defined early but inner conflicts are ignored.  By the end of the movie the only thing that could have made this movie at least \\"3 stars\\" (and saved it from mediocrity) was the denouement, unfortunately it failed there because it was made to please the masses; end it with a smile, end it with a life affirming shot, when it was anything but life affirming.<br /><br />The ending is pretty insulting to at least my intelligence. As if somehow the conclusion is \\"all good\\". Perfect example is \\"Apocalypse Now\\", the ending there confirms the madness, the horror in the world, it just doesn't brush it aside like this movie did; leaving me with a bitter taste in my mouth from the convention end that discredited all the work of the entire movie up till then, a plot that was attempting not be clich&eacute;d. But in the end, turned out to be far more clich&eacute;d and vanilla than one of those old Lone Ranger episodes.<br /><br />One last thought: had I known that this movie was written by the same person who wrote \\"The Recruit\\",Kurt Wimmer, I would have avoided it, because that movie is in my do not ever mention again, garbage pile.

0757302661|5.0|After the relatively easy, but pain and fear-filled birth of my first child, I decided to look around for other options, ideas, philosophies, etc. for the pregnancy and birth of my second child. Early on (2nd month I believe), I found out about a HypnoBirthing Class using the Mongan method at a maternity store. The saleswoman swore by the class and told me I should seriously consider it. It sounded neat, so my husband and I enrolled and attended 3 of the 4 classes. While we were not so impressed with the class itself- or the instructor- it was this book (part of the class ciriculum)and it's philosophy, the Method, and the CD (included w/book)that left a huge [positive] impression on both of us.<br /><br />Basically, the idea is overcoming the fear of birth and using deep breathing and relaxation techniques to put oneself in a deeply relaxed state. This in turn loosens the muscles around the vaginal opening and helps the muscles in the abdomen and pelvic floor to work very effectively. It is the tensing of the body from fear that causes the most pain and creates more fear. Supposedly, in this kind of state, labor progresses more naturally and quicker than if one were afraid and in great pain because in the latter state the muscles become constricted and deprived of oxygen, tightening up and taking longer to get the job done. Let me say, though, that contrary to one of the other reviews, I never felt led to believe from this book that labor would be pain-free. It was more an idea of how to minimize, cope and accept whatever pain may be present and keep focused on breathing and relaxing.<br /><br />I also want to say that I have been a pretty high-strung, mile-a-minute, intense perfectionist for most of my adult life. I was very hesitant to believe that I, of anyone, could use and apply these techniques in a way that would actually work.<br /><br />Long story short, I read the book cover to cover and listened to the CD every day for the entire rest of the pregnancy. Marie has a nice voice and speaks with calm confidence. I enjoyed listening to both tracks. It helped me fall asleep and sleep better. Even when I would fall asleep, the CD would still play and I would assimilate the information, probably into my subconscious which is a good thing. I tore the muscles between my ribs in the 2nd trimester and used the breathing techniques for the pain. I was amazed at the results and didn't need any pain killers, save for Advil once or twice during the entire 6 week healing.<br /><br />At 7.5 months, I switched to a home birth and went into labor the day before the due date. I began employing the Mongan Method and before I knew it, I was in a very inward state, breathing and focusing deeply. It all seemed so natural, not like I was trying at all. I honored the process, my body and every moment. I stayed relaxed and the stages of labor went by one after the other, only minutes apart. The first time I began to feel afraid was about 45 minutes into labor and the midwife reminded me immediately to take a deep, releasing breath. That's all it took and I was right back on track. The second time was during the \\"non\\" pushing stage and my husband reminded me to \\"breathe the baby down\\" (one of the techniques). Again, I immediately got right back on track because it was something I had practiced over and over and over. I say \\"non\\" pushing because I never pushed. The uterus just squeezed the baby out by itself. I just hung on to the side of the tub and let my body go. And it did. It was incredible, and the book described it just like that. By the time the baby just slid out, it had been an hour and a half since I felt the first contraction and about 35-45 minutes of active labor.<br /><br />Not everyone has fast deliveries, but I believe this book can help anyone if they allow it to. This book is an opportunity, a very cheap way to change your life, your pregnancy and your birth. Skip the class if you don't have the money. If you read the book- twice is even better- and listen to the CD every day, you will have tools not many are lucky enough to employ during birth. Not everyone will have the same experience as I did, but if you truly embrace the Mongan Method and put your heart into it, I have no doubt you'll have a wonderful experience and it will no doubt be better than if you had not found the Mongan Method.<br /><br />I believe the reason my labor went so quickly is because I used the Mongan method, which taught me to let my body and nature do the work they are designed to do, without getting in the way. The best way to cooperate is to stay calm, focused and relaxed. I know it is hard to imagine being relaxed during birth, but this book teaches you how and you can achieve it if you PRACTICE. I doubt you will be able to learn the techniqes unless you practice, practice, practice... and realx. Reading the book alone probably won't do the trick. Like anything new you learn, you must apply yourself. If you apply yourself to this, the results will change your life.<br /><br />My husband was in total awe that all the things the book said happened exactly the way they were described. To a T. I felt some pain, but it was short lived because I wasn't afraid of it and it was a good pain, all part of the process. I now love birth and would like to have 10 babies just for the sheer joy of birth- I don't think I will, though. This book not only helped me master self-hypnosis but changed my life. These are techniques you can and will use for all aspects of your life forever.<br /><br />I had the birth of my dreams and my baby has had no medication in his system- ever.<br /><br />I encourage you to read this book and use the tools Marie Mongan presents. My advice is to read it and start listening to the CD as early in the pregnancy as possible. I believe it's paramount. The more you practice, the more rooted and natural it will become. It is an easy read. She explains everything you need to understand, the CD's are great, and the chapters are well labeled if you need to skip around.<br /><br />Oh, and water birth rocks!D every day, you will have tools not many are lucky enough to employ during birth.

0061968579|3.0|I recently only heard of Shutter Island after seeing a barrage of commercials on TV for the movie. After a quick search on Google i realized it's based on a novel(clever,huh?). I bought the novel (of the same name) and the comic together. If your not sure which to get i strongly recommend the novel over the comic and leave the comic for fanboys and collectors. The whole thing is pretty confusing in the comic.I can't see how anyone who hasn't read the book will have a clue as to what's going on. There's simply not enough dialog. It lacks lots of the suspense of the book.  As a previous review mentioned, both main characters look nearly identical and it's hard to tell one from the other sometimes.  The art is pretty good but devoid of nearly all color which i guess sets the mood right about the place but it's still a little bland.<br /><br />All in all i'd say read the book which is much better.<br /><br />3/5

B002XMGGK6|5.0|I have no idea who Kathleen Fennessy is. Her name is on the editorial review, which may or may not be from a \\"professional\\" point of view, but she would be a much more convincing authority on this film if she'd actually seen it. For starters, in just the THIRD sentence into it, she gets it completely wrong. If she'd actually seen it, she would know that Ames is the one who gets the death sentence after Darby (who actually committed the brutal murders) testifies against him. Simple enough. I didn't have to take any notes to remember that. Also, Darby only gets three years. He's been out seven years by the time Clyde goes after him. After Clyde goes to prison, members of the justice system who had anything to do with the original murder start to die, not just members of Rice's legal team. Also they don't \\"suspect\\" him of the crimes, they KNOW because Clyde TOLD them he was doing it. They connected him to them from his CONFESSION. Rice doesn't race against the clock to do anything. In fact, he does everything possible NOT do anything except not believe Clyde is capable of anything. He never tried to save the lives of his assistant attorney Sarah, or the D.A. They were never trying to tie Clyde to the crimes. They were looking for an accomplice to also send to prison. THAT'S what the movie is about. The \\"race against time\\" was to find out who was helping him. Clyde flat out TOLD them it was him.     Ms. Hennessy got the whole thing wrong. NOBODY should listen to what she wrote. You absolutely cannot review something  you've never seen. Next time, while you're \\"watching a film for review:  a) take some notes  b) stay off the laptop  c) turn off your cell phone  d) and I can't say this enough, TAKE SOME DAMN NOTES!    Having said all of that, I liked this film very much. Gerard Butler was heartbreaking and kind of evil, but you are totally sympathetic to him and I found myself rooting for him again and again, even as things amped up. Jamie Foxx played the prosecuting attorney flatly, a kind of \\"one note\\" portrayal and his character's continuing refusal to feel anything for the wronged father made me not care who had to die for him to get the message. And how many people DID die before he finally took Butler's character serioiusly?   The effects were great and I loved the third act. What a kick in the ass!   I highly recommend this film. Lots of killing going on but it is creatively done and to me, that matters more than seeing blood and guts just to see blood and guts.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|Watching through the first 2 parts of Masterpiece theater, I was convinced that this was the best Emma ever. However, the ending left me with much to be desired. Was Emma crying when Mr. Knightley was trying to confide his feelings to her? And then bursting into Mr. Knightley's study, sobbing that she cannot leave her father to marry him. Emma was such a strong character in the beginning, I don't understand why they turned her into a watering pot in the end. Perhaps it was that time of the month for Emma or the writer?     I still watch the movie over and over again, though I always cringe and try to stop myself from fast forwarding at those parts. Other than that, I love Romola Garai and Jonny Lee Miller's portrayal of the characters.

In his star-making lead role, Jeremy Renner makes it completely believable that his bomb disposal duties -- though agonizing and anxiety-provoking to watch -- could also create an adrenaline-fueled addiction where the daily reward is simply cheating death.  A must-see film.  The special features are also engrossing.
B001FB4W16|5.0|Have watched the first 3 disc's so far and am thoroughly enjoying the series, I even have my friends hooked on it now...Looking forward to watching the rest today...<br />If you are into Vampire shows and even if you are not (my friend isn't) you will enjoy this series...
B002NXSRVG|3.0|I thought G.I. Joe was the american hero. This movie was alright. But I wish it was just a american force. I don't remember G.I. Joes being a international force. They should have just called the movie Joe and left the G.I. off of the title. But other than that I liked the movie
B001BTG2FG|5.0|I finished this book at 2 this morning and I already miss it, miss the characters that drew me in. If I hadn't read it on Kindle (thank-you for making this available!), I would be lending it out to all my friends and family, reader and non-reader alike.  Sharon Kay Penman did such a skillful job with this novel - faithfully weaving together the known historical details and the casting of Richard III in a whole new light.     Having just read Philippa Gregory's book about Elizabeth Woodville, The White Queen (which was a very enjoyable, well-written love story), I wasn't sure I wanted to read 900+ pages about Richard, but the reviews sold me on The Sunne in Splendour and am I ever grateful!  What a thrilling ride - rousing battle scenes, tricky political schemes, moments of great tenderness, and above all, complex characters whose dreams we could share.  Even knowing how it would end, I wept when Richard was killed and couldn't stop wishing for the \\"could have been\\" outcomes.  How anyone survived the destruction and despair of the time is beyond me - all the death, all the heartbreak, all the betrayals.  When I finally went up to bed, it was a comfort to check on my four kids and see them sleeping safe and sound. Seldom have I read a book that hit me on so many different levels.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|I bought this DVD for my kids as a Christmas gift. After searching all over, I was ecstatic to find it here for such a reasonable price. The item shipped quickly and my kids were very happy. Thanks!
0316017922|4.0|I expected to hate this book, under the mistaken assumption that it was some blowhard business self-help book.  But it's a very sly book.  Essentially, Gladwell is reminding us why affirmative action is important, while never actually making the case for it: give people access to what they need to thrive, and most will succeed.  True, you can't solve for the luck of being born on a certain date, coming into a rising industry at just the right time, or having parents in particular lines of work (garment manufacture!  who knew?!).  But the case of the white-guy genius with the crappy life says it all: IQ is nothing without opportunity.  It's a good read, too.
B002KDUDG6|4.0|was very pleased  -  but did  take 3 weeks to  receive   order ??  like new  was   happy      overall!
B002YIHO7I|2.0|It is great to have SADE back in music land. However, after the first two songs on this CD one must wonder what SADE had on her mind? The rest of the CD is rather weak.  I guess I was spoiled by SADE's other great works, they were always sexy, erotic, and clever. She always had three or more great songs on her CDs. Not this time.  I had major issues with the title \\"solider of love\\",especially when the USA is at war.Seems like a better title could have been used.  I still love you(SADE), and love is stronger than Pride. Don't wait another 10 years to create more music, stay fresh and relevant, maybe a Cd every 2-5 years will do.
1423101472|5.0|After having read some reviews I wasn't sure if I would enjoy this last book in the series, because many were saying that it is basically just one huge battle all the way through - which sounded really boring to me. Thankfully this is not true, instead there's a great story with excellent pacing, interesting backstory and character development, beautiful symbolism - and a lot of heart.     The ending is very satisfying and wraps up all the loose ends. And especially readers who felt frustrated with the way our heroes were often used like puppets by the gods in the beginning will be happy to see how they actually get to change the world for the better this time around.     And the writing style is still just as funny as it was in the first book, a very dry wit that never becomes cynical and didn't prevent me from emotionally connecting with the characters at all.     I would definitely recommend this series to teenagers and adults alike!
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Soldier Of Love is definitely a concept album that doesn't bring me down, yes some of the lyrics are somewhat sad but not depressing, I really enjoyed this new cd!! I love the nuances that the musicians bring to 'Be That Easy' and the country soul of 'In Another Time' and 'Skin'(my favorite track), 'The Moon and the Sky' is beautiful, 'Morning Bird' & 'The Safest Place' are very delicate and straight to the point, 'Soldier Of Love' what can I say about this track? Sade's \\"I will survive' theme, when I first heard this song I thought NOTHING on radio sounds like this! Welcome back Sade and don't take to long for another release!!! I can understand why this cd went Gold(500,000 units sold)during it's first week on sale!
B001JNNDAQ|1.0|The color scheme that was used for this Blu-ray product looks unnatural and is not true to the original film.  The color changes are so pathetic that the Blu-ray production should be called \\"The French Disconnection\\"
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Excellent information. Very supportive of the whole foods and organic farmers labor. The public needs to know this information...and with the result, we should insist on whole and healthy foods that should be sold in the mainstream. And....get rid of violators that make many destructive acts to our natural beings due to their capitalistic greed such as Monsento. Perhaps this is the \\"why\\" of what we wonder about in todays childhood diseases and psychological problems we suffer, come from. Duh!
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Don't expect too much and you'll enjoy this book.  It was entertaining and suspenseful .
0786868724|5.0|I'm a pastor, who is starting a new church plant in North Texas and \\"Have a Little Faith\\" is a must read for every spiritual leader. It strips down market driven approaches to faith, American consumerism towards faith, and boils down what authentic faith is really all about. I've already suggested to pastors to put down their church growth books, theological diatribes and drink in the fresh water of Albom's book. If you are a pastor or spiritual leader of any kind then this should be your practical handbook in fulfilling your calling to God and mankind. Mitch, thank you for being an instrument in the story of our lives!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This was an excellent product! It arrived promptly and in great condition. I was very satisfied with this purchase! Can't wait for Season 2 to come out!  : )
B00338QENI|5.0|Wow.  This book really puts a face to a \\"product\\" in my opinion.  I just had no idea that such a huge part of our medical history can be traced to one person.  Many thanks to the author for bringing this story to our attention.  I have benefitted from the results of medical science personally.  I've live the past year thinking that my cancer cure was way too easy.  I felt guilty for surviving and having an easy time of it.  Now I feel I owe my survival and so much appreciation to those who have contributed to make me well.  I'll live each day more fully and be thankful to Henrietta Lacks and her family.    Although they never before received the acknowledgement for their mother's contribution, even without her or their consent, know that I am one person who will now bless them every day in my prayers.  Thank you may not ever set the wrong to rights, but never will I forget their story or ever again feel guilt for my survival.  Instead I will appreciate each day and every member of my family.  Thank you Rebecca Skloot for giving us the face of the Lacks family!
1433502445|5.0|I didn't want to wait for the large print, so I purchased this bible. It is not hard to see the verse with my 1.5 readers at all, but the comments are alittle challenging to see. Good quality book with helpful and in my opinion biblicle coments.
1591843162|2.0|I am a fan of Seth's previous books, but not this one.  Too much of what he discusses in the book is repeated over and over throughout.  I found myself literally falling asleep while reading it, which I have never done with his other works.  I quite honestly found it to be a waste of time, and can honestly say I did not walk away with a single new thought or idea that wasn't already covered in other books I have read.  If you want to read the best of Seth Godin, read \\"The Dip\\", not \\"Linchpin\\".
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I bought the True Blood Season One on DVD after starting to watch the 2nd Season on HBO after everyone was hyping the show up. I love it and was easily drawn in to the series; even my husband loves it. Makes you want to read the book series (which I have also done).
1400052173|5.0|This is a fascinating and eye opening book.  I was also diagnosed with cervical cancer like Henrietta (25 years later than she was and with much better results thank God) and I have been inspired to go in search of my own medical history and my own \\"cells\\".  Everyone should read this book.
B000001EPB|5.0|I bought this CD in used condition for a very cheap price, it came in less than a week and was in mint condition, like new! I am really enjoying it. I have converted it to MP3 and put it on my MP3 player.
B003629IPW|5.0|I agree with Tommy Morrias - \\"I'm glad they made this film.\\" ...too.    After all the scandals and havoc that are going around his life, it's good to get to see MJ this way - the serious workaholic that loves and knows too well about almost everything in his business. His love, his attitude, his talents and his professionalism, none of them failed to struck me at any point of time. The King of Pop, he will forever be.    Fell in love with him even more after this show. It's a pity that he's no more with us. Rest in Peace, MJ.
1594488843|5.0|This is an essential read for anyone running any part of any organization. For the past twenty years, many of us who have been conducting research in the fields of cognitive science and organizational behaviour as well as working with business people have known about the disconnect between what the science tells us of what motivates people at work, and standard business practice. Finally, Dan Pink has made that case clearly and forcefully. We all need to upgrade to Motivation 3.0 and get managers and colleagues to do so as well (read the book and then buy it for every one in the company :)).<br /><br />All jobs change all the time, and there is no escaping the three pressures of new technologies (which will do what you do differently), globalization (someone in the world will do what you do cheaper) and mindless financial pressure (in any case, your position will be made redundant). Keeping dynamic work environments in this setting is about engagement, not compliance - it's about motivating people to find better ways to do better thing - and this, as Dan Pink brilliantly demonstrates - cannot happen with simplistic carrot-and-stick reward models.<br /><br />Stress at work is a large topic in France, and most managers complain of the stress inflicted by their own bosses but hardly ever realize how much their own behavior stresses their employees. Systematic disengagement, and the resulting productivity and creativity loss will continue until managers realize how much they frustrate the needs for autonomy, mastery and purpose of any one at work, and find a way to release the incredible forceful drive of getting things right. This book tells you why, and how. A splendid contribution.
0767817710|5.0|Ellen, an unknown female gunslinger rides into a small, dingy and depressing prairie town with a secret as to her reason for showing up. Shortly after her arrival, a local preacher, Cort, is thrown through the saloon doors while townfolk are signing up for a gun competition. The pot is a huge sum of money and the only rule: that you follow the rules of the man that set up the contest, Herod. Herod is also the owner, leader, and \\"ruler\\" of the town. Seems he's arranged this little gun-show-off so that the preacher,who use to be an outlaw and rode with Herod will have to fight again. Cort refuses to ever use a gun to kill again and Herod, acknowledging Cort as one of the best, is determined to alter this line of thinking, even if it gets someone killed. This movie uses lot's of ingredients used in classic westerns. It does it in a fun way but it doesn't spoof the classic westerns in any way and it never becomes humorous or a parody that makes fun of the genre. This movie is filled with some unusual but great Sam Raimi like cinematography and tricks. Enjoy and pay attention to the story. It is just entertainment.
B001PPLJJ0|2.0|Yes the acting in \\"The Reader\\" film is superb, the visual scenes perfected to a fault, the ability to expose the raw emotions of guilt and the need in trying to redeem oneself, are all here in this film, but for what purpose?    Is this film really trying to show a realistic side to Germany's past or just another movie trying to pull at our emotional strings in an attempt of grasping an Oscar?    I may seem cynical, but for me this film too readily glosses over the cruelty that some people perpetrated at this time. The repetitive scenes of perfect gray backgrounds endless shots of pouting by all the characters with somber music to assist in the mood and the classic film filler of smoking a cigarette for dramatic effect of deep contemplation (Freud would say of guilty sexual pleasures) is too scripted for my pallet.    I can understand that many people will find this film a profound revelation and/or even a classic representation of flawless acting that achieves a balance of realism seldom found in the Hollywood movie industry.    For me however, it loses purpose, by not exposing the ugly side of human nature for which we are all vulnerable to regardless of nationality, faith, or moral upbringing.    The film is too self absorbed into the characters of Hanna and Michael's feeling of guilt and shame which makes them come across somewhat pathetic and bland. It overindulges in trying to have us feel sympathetic to the characters plights.    Like most people if you like soap operas you will probably love this movie. If not, you may find this film a bit staged and historically compromised to appease the Oscar Gods.
1595141715|4.0|I recomend this book to young teens. I doubt that anyone who has been out of high school for more than ten years will relate or care at all because everything in it seems petty at that point. to the mature mind, everything in this book will make it seem like Hannah Baker was an overreactive child who wallowed in the confinds of her own self-pitying mind. A teenager will, however, relate to how Hannah feels. Everything is a big deal to a high school girl, and this book demonstrates that well. It was good enough to make me consider the way i treat those around me a bit more. When it is put together as a whole, even the little things do matter and Jay does a good job or protraying that. four stars.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|This movie surprised me in many ways, first how someone from our world could act in Jane Austen's second how long the movie was. I was not expecting a three hour movie but was not upset about it, I am very pleased that they followed the main story for the most part. However no Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner every even gets spoken of! It is quite shocking that the characters that I love so much could have a lot more to them then what is printed on the page. I won't give it away but to see Ms. Bingley, Georgiana, and Wickham in a different light like they were was surprising. Very well done, funny, witty, and a great love story!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These dual triggers make shooters and racing games actually good on the ps3. Really solid as well, haven't slipped off controller.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I have seen almost every adaptation of Jane Austen's books and was surprised that this one did not get a lot of press. This movie follows the book really faithfully and added some tidbits of fun with her dreams about the books she reads. The chemistry was great between everyone and the relationships where given a lot of attention. This movie is great one of my favorites, it is of course no Pride and Prejudice but it does come close in my books. Always a sucker for Jane!
B002T9H2LA|1.0|this movie was a horrable dissapointment ... if you'r a speed reader you may enjoy it because it's all subtitled in english and spoken in franch and german. the plot is impossible to follow because you spend all your time trying to read what they say! end of story!!!
1433502410|4.0|The ESV translation has been my favorite for the last few years, but the study material they've included here is truly amazing. However, randomly reading, I did find some minor factual errors in the section about Eastern Orthodoxy in one of the end articles. It syas that the Coptic and Syrian churches are Eastern Orthodox Churches like the Greek and Russian are. In reality, they are Oriental Orthodox churches, meaning that they hold a heretical belief about the nature of Christ (monophystitism, pre-Calcedonian heresy), which the Eastern Orthodox churches reject. Otherwise, the material concerning the Bible itslef is above average.
B0030MM68O|2.0|I couldn't get into the characters. It seemed like I should have been identifying with the characters and how they handled their situation, but I found myself bored more than anything. I felt no connection with the characters. I now understand why so many reviews just picked on the realism and what kind of uniform they were wearing. There wasn't much else to pick on.
B000002I53|5.0|This is Coltrane playing classic, melodic tunes, including popular tunes of the era. How well does he do it? Impeccably. This is one of my most listened-to albums. I confess that on many mellow days, I just re-start the disc rather than insert another one. I for one can listen to these pieces over and over again. It's not his most leading edge work, but it is rich, sumptuous, subtle, comfortable entertainment. Like having a second - or third - slice of chocolate cake.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Have to admit that I wasn't sure what to expect with the Blu-ray release of Serenity. Especially after seeing the DVD release. However, the Serenity Blu-ray was one of the first titles I purchased on Blu-ray, recently, after purchasing my first Blu-ray player. I have to say that I was duly impressed with the picture quality and the audio quality.    If you're thinking that this is just a regular release and that picture quality isn't that great, then you would be mistaken. Not only are the image crisp and clear but on a 32\\" HDTV, the detail just blew me away. I'm anxiously waiting to purchase the Firefly television series on Blu-ray. I think science fiction is one of the few genres that take advantage of this new technology.    With current movies that are filmed in digital of HD technology, the picture quality will absolutely blow you away. I can't say much for the sound since I have yet to purchase a sound system but the sound quality is a whole lot better than the DVD version.    If you're on the fence about this title on Blu-ray, I would highly recommend this Blu-ray release because I think you'll be impressed. It's one of the best Science Fiction movies of all time and wraps up the cliffhanger plot that left fans hanging when the Firefly television series was canceled.
031237674X|5.0|Dr. Tucker does an amazing job of presenting straight-forward facts. This book is filled with fascinating case histories that have been meticulously documented by Drs. Stevenson and Tucker. They are inexplainable in their detail and are incredibly complex. Dr. Tucker focuses mainly on past-life recall through memories of children, matching birthmarks, facial similarities through face recognition software, and other documentable evidence. It might disappoint some that he stays away from memories from hypnosis, but the book is undeniable in its strong evidence because of his focus.
B002S8AH00|5.0|I actually had to return this movie because I already owned it.  But I love the movie and the digital copy is really good for trips!
B001V9LPWQ|2.0|Of course this Blu-ray is better than the DVD, but the PQ is not what you expect from a Blu-ray. If you give 4 or 5 stars to the PQ of Snow White, so I think ... Cars, Horton, etc., deserves how many stars ? 30 or 40 ... Of course!!!
B002DKGWSE|3.0|If ever there was a film that had room for improvement the original \\"Last House On The Left' surely fits the bill. While this remake is better on many levels, it doesn't really pack the punch of the original in certain areas. The remake has better acting and is much slicker with better FX, but I didn't think it felt as brutal. That's not to say this is a bad thing as I really don't need to see graphic rapes scenes in a film for them to have an impact. One curiosity is they cut the most memorable scene from the original when on of the intruders gets his......well...\\"you know what\\" bit off! This is somewhat redeemed at the end of the film when the father gives the last surviving intruder the \\"Jiffy Pop\\" treatment!......Popcorn anyone? ;-b
B00002ZMNV|4.0|Everything Metallica touches turns to gold and rocks...this included.  Songs like Fuel and Battery...awesome.  Too bad no Creeping Death and too much crap from Reload.
055380684X|3.0|The title perked my interest and since I had read several other text dealing with deliberate practice, I expected great things.  Unfortunately, I feel that Coyle promised much, but failed to deliver anything of significant applicalbe value.  He broached the concept of myelin wrapping in relation to increased performance, etc.  He then proceeded to use an \\"examples\\" of hot beds of training; however, the attempted tie in with performance became anecdotal.  I did not except a \\"how to do book\\", but I did expect valid insights in the process of talent development -- Basically, Coyle fell well short of proving anything of value.  On the positive side, the book was well written even if it circular in its content.
B000089CJI|5.0|I first heard Such Great Heights in Iraq when I was in the military, I thought it was genius.  A perfect blend of quirky beats, electronic sounds and soft lyrics.  I picked this CD up...I am so glad I did.  One of those CD's you can put on anytime and enjoy, not like some hate metal CD you can't listen too unless you feel like being amped.  The songs are very simple, and thats a good thing.  They are not too complex but have the fundemental pleasantness about them.  I once listened to this CD all day while painting my home, it never gets old, it always seems fresh.  Songs like Clark Gable and The District Sleeps Alone Tonight are unbelieveable, and some are jsut good.  There is not one bad song on this CD.  I have played this before in my office, with people initially commenting \\"Oh dude what is this crap\\" and \\"What the heck are you listening to?\\" most of these people never give this CD a chance.  Eventually thru heavy play people appreciate it and like it.  Not so much my Depeche Mode though.  Buy this CD if you are introverted...or enjoy pastel life, contemporary by nature.  This CD is for you, if you are a trend follower listening to Little Wayne and think the world revolves around what American Idol contestant whom just won last month and put an album out this month written by music exec's has to offer and offer only and anything else is \\"not cool\\" please pass, you are a disgrace to individual thinking.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|This movie stunk. I knew it was going to be a modernized version of the Sherlock Holmes legacy, but the only thing this movie had in common with the original story were a few names and the deductive reasoning of Holmes. Everything else about it felt wrong and out of place, especially the fight scenes. The original Holmes was highly intelligent, but he never used this talent to be some kind of MMA fighter. The vibe of this movie was also far too slapstick for my liking and it was really hard to understand what the characters were saying because of the English accents. I usually don't have a problem with this kind of thing, but this movie needed subtitles. The story itself was terrible and I nearly walked out, but it was one of those things where I figured I sat here this long and might as well stay to the ending. That was a mistake because the ending sucked too. I can't believe these guys think they are going to make another movie. It is rare that sequels top the first movie and anything worse than this movie would be a disaster.
B000002KIE|5.0|Allot of people think the Pistols are like modern punk....like speed fast screaming punk...like guys that Nirvana were inspired to play fast and scream too punk.  they get a bad rap because of some what contrived antics and appearance, also a bunch of wanna be's trying to hard to not conform and unable to play a note. For all that the pistols musically never get the credit they deserve.  They are not like the Ramones...2-3 minute blitzfests of simplicity and not much thought (though they have there moment of greatness in those songs)...they are much more, and in retrospect for the time period very creative in their song writing approaches when it came to the music arrangements.  Many remember Anrachy in the UK...or God Save the Queen, they were very trash but songs like Bodies, Liar, Pretty Vacant, etc show very creative changes and interludes that most never appreciate.  When I first heard this CD I tought wow they are actually really good musicians.  The drummer is very craft.  It's just a shame so many posers throw on some grubby clothes and fashionably get anger and depressed claim angst pointing at the Pistols as their battle cry.  Therefore scorning a great band with a lot of dirt for which they are stained to the people that probably would really like the ablum.  These are great songs.
B002VWNICW|2.0|This is a review of the Blu ray release only not the film as such which has been covered elsewhere. The main problem is with the sound track. As has been pointed out by another reviewer everyone speaks so fast it is hard to catch what is being said. The subtitles which would normally help are an absolute disaster: The speaker location system is used which results in the subtitles frequently running to three lines but they also hop about - left, centre or right, even top and bottom - depending where the speaker appears on the screen. To make it more difficult, like the speech, they are displayed only fleetingly and it is too often impossible to read them before they are gone. A further issue is the balance: speech is generally overpowered by the music and one is constantly fiddling with the volume control.<br /><br />The picture quality is acceptable but I did not find it as sharp or as well color balanced as I had hoped. The BBC Blu ray is of course a different version of the story but it is technically very good, especially considering its age and original format, and vastly superior to this most disappointing transfer.
B00009P1O2|4.0|My brother is a HUGE Queen fan, I thought they were underrated in America too.  I bought him this and he loved it and played it almost everyday for what seemed like forever, this is the only Queen live CD or DVD you ever need of them live.  They play all there hits and the crowd eats them alive.  Freddie cements his legacy thru this performance.  One thing I liked about this is he doesn't wear some flaming outfit like he did back in earlier concerts.  The spandex and nonsense.  I think it takes away from how gifted the guy was because people will jsut focus on that and his lifestyle.  None of the songs stray from the album unlike bands like Metallica have done, but the songs live sound better than the original album versions.  One key moment is the banter between Freddie and the audience.  He truly was a master at stagecraft and this clip has been replayed almost everytime they bring him up in media.  His vocal dives followed by the crowds meager attempts...classic Freddie.
0684833395|4.0|The title has entered our language as a description of certain situations into which we might fall. The humor in this work is wicked.<br /><br />The focal character of this book is John Yossarian, a bombardier in the Air Force who wants to get out of combat duty. He runs into Catch-22: to get out of duty, you must be unfit to fly. But to want out is to show that one is sane--hence, not unfit!<br /><br />The book, by Joseph Heller, is an interesting take on behavior and decision-making within organizations. Bureaucracy is one target of Heller's writing.<br /><br />The style is exasperating! The work goes back and forth in time; different characters' perspectives are involved. Multiple iterations are used to explain the ongoing storyline. This can be challenging for readers but it also creates an interesting ethos in the work.<br /><br />But, in the end, this is still well worth reading, even many years after its original publication.
B000001GQ1|5.0|Having just listened to Kempff and Leitner in the fourth and fifth concertos, I don't feel that I can be as unequivocal in my recommendation of Kempff's sonatas as I was of said concertos. Kempff recorded the complete cycle three times, and the performances here are picked from the last of them. Now, there is no doubt that Kempff was at his best in the cycle as a whole, and there is no doubt - I think - that the gloriously light and airy and spirited Waldstein is among the best ever recorded. But I have heard more poetry in the ubiquitous Moonlight sonata, even though Kempff scores many points with his intelligent, wise and balanced reading. The Appassionata is impeccably played, darkly dramatic and powerful though possibly even more heaven-storming in his earlier recording. The highlight, however, is the Pathetique, which is played with unsurpassed drive and ferocity but never lapsing into bathos; rhythmically incisive and formally cogent, almost effortless in its realization of the drama and power. Some will, perhaps, judge it to be a little too understated, and maybe it comes down to personal taste, but I do think it's one of the most satisfying versions of this one I've heard. The sound quality isn't quite top-notch, however; dry and top-heavy and admittedly compromising the artistry of the performances, especially perhaps in the Appassionata. Still, it feels wrong to give this release anything but a very strong recommendation.
B0036B8MXC|5.0|This show succeeds in capturing the atmosphere surrounding the ancient games, albeit in a manner made comprehensible to the modern viewer. One experiences the full impetus of the horror and excitement. The set designs have been well conceived, as well as most of the costumes.    However, the scripting is completely inaccurate in accordance with how people of the period expressed and conducted themselves, and historical accuracy has been ignored. The show does however, possess a quality of its own.    The plot is a good reconstruction of events in Capua in light of historical sources relating to Spartacus' time spent there being non-existent.    Definitely a worthwhile watch!
159562015X|5.0|The item has a high rating ... I would have to give Amazon a low rating on this purchase.  I needed 33 books, but was limited to purchasing only 3 books.  Needless to say, Amazon lost my business when I had to go somewhere else to purchase the remainder of the books.  I now have a membership with Barnes and Noble with free shipping that will be utilized going forward.  Not to say that I will not look to Amazon again in the future for other purchases.

B0000640VO|5.0|I rarely watch something that I can say is utterly unique.  Amelie is.  To begin with, it's a lovely movie, visually.  But what's more, it appeals to the sarcastic, embittered adult's humor while maintaining such a beautiful childlike innocence of character and plot line. Amelie is a whimsical, quiet girl, who likes to toy with those who are a part of the everyday world that she seems only to watch, never to quite fit in to.  This movie awakened in me a sensation I often forget, but as a writer, need so desperately to cling to.
0099511169|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

142313494X|5.0|There have been a number of stories relating to mythology it's a subject that brings our fantasies to life in ways we would not imagine because we need move forward in life if given the chance of lifetime in opportunity to be the son/daughter of a great Greek God/Goddess how would we play the story? Riordan brings all this mystery and magic into play with a young man who has problems of his own to deal with on top of which he is now a demigod hero. There are many morals and philosophies in the book, they are dealt with great imagination. Ancient beliefs brought into the 21st century where new meets old in which  the two naturally lock in battle. The story is of course itself an epic struggle of great proportion for a young man given such an enormous task of becoming a hero to his people in battling many of his foes along the way. Mythology has been with us since time immemorial and it will continue to stay, it's a subject matter that's has always been brimming with potential drama and action play. Riordan is an obvious good writer and teacher who knows his subject well. Greek Gods of all the Gods were the most cantankerous of the  prima donna status in drama plays in which they all too well knew what they needed and wanted and got it no other ways and, Riordan has felt this about it  and delivers us to these Gods in a story as well, in which in the end i thoroughly enjoyed in the book and it,s sequels and I would recommend them to anyone that enjoys a good dramatic read in it,s plays in which  anyone would have gotten a brush out of dramatic reading in Greek Mythology.
0316044938|4.0|Surprising book.  I don't normally read books like this that have some supernatural elements but really it's a story about family and how they deal with grief.  These are a few points and impressions of this book.<br /><br />Sebold surprised me.  I expected a murder mystery or a story of vengeance or something of that nature.  Harvey, the child murderer is looked at during the book naturally.  In fact he commits the deed in the rape and murder of Susie Salmon (like the fish, we are reminded!) and we get to see the insides of his mind and motive.  Sebold writes the crime neatly and not graphically at all, which I was glad to see.<br /><br />Harvey is not a character written of much.  He takes little time through most of the book.  In fact Harvey is rarely doing much of anything during the majority of the book.  He does meet his end at the end of the book (which is not a spoiler, you have to expect that the bad guy gets his just desserts) but it's written as an afterthought, a footnote.  Ho hum.<br /><br />The book also explores the Salmon family dealing with its grief and the community coming together.  The community comes together more out of sympathy and \\"now I'm supposed to\\" but other friends and family seem more sincere.<br /><br />The big parts of the story revolve around Susie's mom, her sister Lindsey and her life, and Ray (the foreign-born boy in a white neighborhood, though race is not touched on much).<br /><br />The mom was the biggest disappointment.  She completely gives up on the family when they needed her the most, tries and fails to get a cathartic from adultery and ends up in California moping and feeling sorry for herself.  Quite a pathetic character though she comes into her own at the end.<br /><br />There's a supernatural incident when Susie actually comes to take over a body for a brief few hours.  Does she use this unusual incident to tell people who her killer was?  No!  She makes love to a boy she's always wanted to \\"do it\\" with when she was living.  I mean, yeah, romantic but far from this practical reader's logical sense!<br /><br />Overall, the book is an emotional response to grief and how people deal and survive, choices made and living with those decisions.  It's not a murder mystery.  It's not even a ghost story, really.<br /><br />The book also uses a flashback within flashback mode that is odd and takes some getting used to.<br /><br />And the lovely bones?  It's an analogy.

B002NANLCE|5.0|Wonderfully aware of its influences in science, philosophy and literature, Flashforward tells a powerful and compellingly character-driven story centered around the promise of a freak accident permitting everyone (almost) in the world an opportunity to glimpse the future. Ignore the review accusing Sawyer and his book of &#34;arrogant liberalism&#34; - an obstinately insular misunderstanding of futurism and characterization. I will admit that the TV show drew me in. The book is quite different and great on its own merits.

1400052173|5.0|Henrietta Lacks, a poor black woman in the 1950's, feels a \\"knot\\" in her belly and goes to a Johns Hopkins segregated ward to seek medical help. A test reveals cervical cancer, and a sample of a tumor is taken and sent to George Gey, whose interest is in growing cells for medical testing. That act sets off an incredible, amazing chain reaction, telling the story of an amazing cell line that not only refuses to die, but thrives, as well as the story of equity, science, and family in America.<br /><br />Science writer Rebecca Skloot learns about this \\"immortal\\" cell line, now called HeLa, as a high school student. Intrigued by the woman who \\"donated\\" them, she begins a journey of uncovering the life of this person. As a white woman, she discovers that getting to talk with the family, who is justifiably suspicious of her (the white community is only interested in black folks when they can make a few bucks off them). However, persistence and determination, as well as student loans and credit cards, allow her to get to know the family, especially Henrietta's daughter Deborah.<br /><br />As Skloot states at the end of the book, Deborah is the emotional center of the story; a woman so wanting just to get to know the mother she never knew (Henrietta died soon after her diagnosis). Lacking a high school education, Deborah had a dictionary and an insatiable stream of questions that would lead her to the truth about her mother. Skloot befriends her, and together, they get to know this woman by interviewing relatives, visiting homesteads, and even taking an emotional journey to Johns Hopkins to see these amazing cells themselves. Deborah is challenging, strong, and compelling.<br /><br />Through this journey, the book wanders its way through racial identities in America, and how the African American community was treated by the medical community, especially in the early part of the 20th century. Poverty, medical ethics, and familial ties all play significant roles in this story. Skoolt masterfully blends all elements equally well, telling a story that is complete and compelling.<br /><br />This book is a must read, for everyone.nds all elements equally well, telling a story that is complete and compelling.

If you don't have an elite xbox you'll need to make a trip to the store to get those as well.  and yeah yeah it has an hdmi switch on the back of the cable but it doesn't look the same    If you have a wireless router near it or any other rf devices you hear pops and crackles while playing.

B0000073NC|3.0|Scorpions breakup then revamp with a whole new lineup to release their second LP `Fly to the Rainbow' in the fall of 1974. Signing a worldwide deal with RCA definitely helped the band gain exposure throughout the continent, Asia and the US. Ulrich Roth replaces Michael Schenker and the first great era of Scorpions begins. Ironically UFO were also putting out their crucial first record with Michael and for Chrysalis (`Phenomenon') and it is interesting how bow bands careers paralleled each other during the Seventies.  Roth was a devoted disciple of Jimi Hendrix which is not only obvious in his psychedelically influenced lead guitar but in his lazy drawl singing voice (Jimi could sing however Uli really can't). \\"Drifting Sun\\" is probably the most obvious Hendrix tribute and it does have some great moments (especially Klaus singing background on the chorus).  \\"Speedy's Coming\\", the lead track, is without a doubt the first great Scorpions' song as it has all the elements of exceptional mid-70's era heavy metal. `Fly to the Rainbow' was overall a general step in the right direction for the band although as I said some of the hangover of `Lonesome Crow' persists (title track checks in a close to ten minutes although much of the first section features some very cool folksy harmonies).  \\"They Need a Million\\" and \\"This Is My Song\\" round the best of the rest on the album as the two ballads are nothing special. The band would go on to make better records after `Fly to the Rainbow' but this is the record that established them as a force in early metal.
B000KIPT30|5.0|I bought this because I have trouble hearing the TV and I've already tried various wireless headphone devices without success. Those that required batteries used them up fast, especially when I didn't remember to turn the unit off. Then, they had to be synced every time I changed the batteries. Others needed to be recharged between sessions and would run dry in the middle of a movie. Others had the hardware built into the headphones making them heavy and requiring replacement of the whole system when the headphones wore out.     Finally I discovered this little headphone amp and I couldn't be happier. To my slightly inadequate ears, it sound very clear and it has far more amplification that I can ever use. My wife uses one of the other outlets occasionally and, of course, there's a couple of spare jacks if I have any hard-of-hearing company. It has a power supply so no more piles of dead batteries.      I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to get a boost or extra ports for any device. It's amplification is far greater than any of the devices I tried that are made for personal music players. Although it has 1/4\\" output jacks, you can buy 1/4 to 3.5 adapters for pennies on Amazon and have an amp that will work with the more common size for an incredible price.     I'm using the headphone amp at the end of a cheap 30 foot cable but it still works very well and the volume controls are smooth and without static. The amp puts out more sound than my ears can, or should take. Unlike most of the other devices I tried, it has the power to drive any headphones I want, including noise cancelling. Finally I can enjoy a movie and hear what everyone is saying.

B001P9EQH8|5.0|I have had mine for about four weeks. It adds a lot more bass to my Grado SR80 headphones without losing any clarity on the highs. I have not heard any hissing or other distortion from this little amp. I don't even need to use the extra-bass EQ switch to hear a distinct improvement.    For my Grados the extra bass EQ is a bit too much. The bass EQ may sound very good some other headphones with less bass punch than mine. BTW, I have had no problems running it while plugged into the USB port charging unlike one of the other posts.    The only downside is that the battery can't be replaced, but the cost of the player is so low it hardly matters.
B000NY12CI|5.0|I'll keep this short because the book must speak for itself-- growing up in America I never truly realized how fortunate I am.  I'm 32 years old and always disparaged being a 'woman' because of being treated somewhat unfairly (grew up in the deep south east).  This novel made me want to run down the road proclaiming loudly that I am a female and I am beautiful and fully intact.  It also opened my eyes to the fact that females are usually the quickest to keep other women down in order to keep the status quo.  I don't know why, but many of the women of Islam are just as militant about suppressing themselves as their overly patriarchal men are.  I will forever be grateful to her for writing this, even if it means that she has to live in hiding and under protection.

0385504225|1.0|First the good side.  Brown does an excellent job, as he has done in the past, with researching his material and adding lots of little insights into Washington, DC geography and history as well as details on Freemasonry and other such organizations.  His plot for the first half of the book moves along reasonably well.      On the bad side.  The book is composed of extremely smart individuals who make lightning leaps in intuition to solve complex puzzles and see around the corner.  And yet, they blunder around the plot with a character who has proven himself to be an evil competent villain and act unsuspiciously and stupidly.  It is in this way that the story resembles a bad movie.    There are also way too many scenes, especially in the second half of the book, where a great secret or plot twist will be revealed, but then requires a main character to be left in the dark with the reader until inch by inch the situation or secret is approached. At last the secret is revealed but by then tedium has set in.  While I think this is a plot device that can be very effective, not when it is used over and over and over.  Worst of all, I had guessed what was coming almost every time.     Finally, the story gets preachy at the end, intermixed with the breathless suspense of gradually revealed truths as described in the previous paragraph.   I read  the last third of the book only to finish and was relieved when I was finally done.
B0026P3G12|4.0|A lovely collection of music.  Boyle has more range than I expected and I much enjoyed the songs that displayed this.  \\"Wild Horses\\" is a really nice, unexpected piece.  \\"Cry Me a River\\" was also nicely done.  And, of course, the title song is a reprise of what made her known around the world in the first place. I like its arrangement and heartfelt delivery.  I think the best aspect of this album is the really spot-on musical arrangements that surround her voice.    The four stars come from the inclusion of one or two tracks that, though probably dear to her heart, didn't really fit with this album in my view.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|All of the film versions of Jane Eyre are flawed; some mildly, some fatally. All films based on masterpieces have the Sisyphian challenge of collecting the vapors of imagination into one mass, giving it form, and moving it against reality.<br /><br />The power of this story is derived from the steadfast integrity of its heroine: To emerge as noble as she does binds us inexorably to her plight. Jane is one of English literature's great characters.<br /><br />The years at Lowood School are given short shrift in all of the filmed versions, but not in the book. Jane's relationship with Helen Burns, Miss Temple and books is pivotal to her salvation from her days with Mrs. Reed, her miscreants, and Brocklehurst and Co. Brocklehurst is finally vilified, but not before he facilitates Helen's death from consumption. This occupies a quarter of the novel. Why is this spiritual-intellectual-tragic foundation universally truncated on film?<br /><br />One of the crucial scenes is the one in which Rochester proposes. Compare all of the versions with this touchstone. The Welles-Fontaine version is ridiculous. The Dalton-Clarke scene is austere and passionless. The Jayson-Cusack energy is cold and stilted. The Scott-York proposal is not credible. The Hinds-Morton is well acted but strangely awkward. The Hurt-Gainsbourg rendition is good, but bitter. This Stephens-Wilson interpretation is convincing and powerful. Wilson's Jane is the most polished of the collection of plain-(and not so plain)-Janes: Her basic integrity the most richly developed and convincing. Wilson, Gainsbourg, and Morton are the most accomplished thespians to date. Clarke, Cusack, and York never disappear into the 1830s. Fontaine looks as though she wafted out of an opium den. Virginia Bruce's Jane is a joke.<br /><br />All of the masters of Thornfield go wanting in one way or another. Fault the script and direction, not their acting skills. Most are consummate actors. In none of the pairings has the string from Edward's rib to Jane's seemed genuine.<br /><br />The \\"Just the right amount of heaving bodies\\" on the marquee, in this BBC production, is embarrassing and inappropriate, as are the bedroom antics. Too bad one cannot edit DVDs as one could VHS tapes. Excise the 21st century from the 19th.<br /><br />Still, after picking scabs off of all of the versions, this heals with the least scar tissue.<br />The denouement is appropriate (a bit contrived), not awkward or abrupt as in the book and the other productions.<br />All of the nine films have their individual strong and weak points. With multiple viewings, one tends to amalgamate the strengths of all to fashion a satisfying whole. It would be wonderful to have, finally, one definitive whole.<br />Alas, this is the most engaging of the lot. It wears very well under the scrutiny of multiple viewings. Wilson's skills are impressively subtle. Examine the scene in which St John confronts Jane with her true identity. Watch her breathing whilst she remains expressionless. Beautifully done.<br /><br />Magnificent production, scabs and all.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|My original review is below. Updating to reflect my views of the Blu Ray transfer - its simply phenomenal.  A definite 5/5 star rating for both the video and audio quality.<br /><br />___<br /><br />I really enjoyed this movie largely because of its excellence in several different categories.  First, the cinematography, camera angles, set design, production values, etc. are simply outstanding.  Brilliant use of flash-back work, slowly falling snow (reminds me of that great sword fight scene in Kill Bill), etc. all combine to create a visually stunning film.  Second, the acting was very good.  The cast was great, and each person was outstanding for his/her particular role.  Ben Kingsly was very believable as a brilliant psych, and his team were great too (including the German guy - perfect casting for the role).  Even Leo, who I often find unbelievable, was outstanding.  The story was phenomenal too.  I was really expecting a more shock/horror type film, but this was much more aligned with the thriller/suspense line.  The movie ends with intimating that one of two potential interpretations of the film are possible.  I personally believe that the evidence for one interpretation outweighs the other (largely because of a final line of dialogue - \\"is it better to live as a monster or die as a good guy\\" (or something like that).  But the story is so well constructed that you could legitimately argue for either interpretation.  Further, while potential twists are somewhat telegraphed early in the film, the primary premise is so well developed and so believable that you don't find yourself constantly predicting the ending.  You should note that the film invites thinking and a bit of debate; if you're looking for a mindless thriller, you'll enjoy, but you'll enjoy much more if you're willing to be cerebrally engaged.

B001QOGYFY|4.0|The studios seemed unsure on how to market this movie and the punchline of being the coldest movie ever filmed hardly inspired confidence in the Antarctica-set thriller and the movie quickly vanished from movie screens. That it did not get an audience could also be explained by the fact that the film never quite identified itself in its marketing material. Was it a paranormal thriller? Was it a horror movie? Was it a psychological thriller? The truth be told it was none of these and was probably closest in structure and narrative to a western.<br />The plot revolves around a research station in the Antarctic that is prepping for a hibernation period where a skeleton crew keep things runnning through the Antarctic winter. A body is discovered on the ice and it is down to a U.S. Marshall (played competently by the always watchable Kate Beckinsale) to piece together the mystery of precisely what happened. The mystery is tied to a missing Cold War era Soviet Union plane that crashed into the ice decades earlier, which is shown as the movie opens, and the mysterious cargo on board.<br />Many complained that the movie makers covered the lithe, beautiful Beckinsale in many layers, but this criticism was hardly a valid one. The star strips down to her underwear within moments of her appearance on the screen but the scene is not gratuitous and is not graphic. For the rest of the movie necessity has her all bundled up but this is in keeping with the nature of the frigid weather which is a character unto itself in the movie. One quickly understands why the movie is set in the Antarctic for the movie uses the inhospitable climate as a mechanism with which to ratchet up the suspense and claustrophic feeling of the production.<br />Overall a satisfying thriller that surprised me in how much I liked it. I had expected to be bored by it but found myself entertained.
1401323820|3.0|This is essentially a book written as a promotion for a TV show, when viewed as such, it really is a decent diversion. If you picked it up thinking it was anything else, you might be disappointed.     However, as a fan of the television show Castle, I was impressed with how the author managed to weave in elements from the show into the book - it was almost believable that Richard Castle writing the prose.

B002ZG4Q5W|3.0|I love this movie/film/whatever.  It floors me every time I experience it.  The blu-ray sound & image was a revelation of possibilities for me!  The extra features are pretty good.  I even loved their package design.  I think they took some queues from Criterion Collection.  The issue here is with the English subtitles:       There are some grammatical/translation errors sprinkled throughout the movie that are distracting.  One example is in the first scene, where Lord Fujimaki declares that he also wanted to offer his daughter as Saburo's wife; the \\"Studiocanal Collection\\" subtitle has him saying it was also his INVENTION instead of INTENTION.  Yikes!  The subtitles were downhill from there.  Not sure if they rushed to get this released or they cut corners, and had the English subtitles imported from China.  I've sent several polite e-mails to Lionsgate regarding the various English subtitle errors, but they never responded back.  Customer service would mean corrected subtitles and disc exchange.         The devil's in the details, my friends.  I'm sure someone at Lionsgate had a great idea that ended with a big \\"$\\" digitally projected onto the wall at a quarterly R&D meeting.  But it takes real commitment and a sincere love of film to do what the Criterion Collection does.  Will I ever hear back from Lionsgate or a \\"Studiocanal Collection\\" representative?  Probably not.  They already have my money so the relationship between company and consumer ends there.  Not reassuring.  In the end, I wish \\"[[ASIN:B000BB14YY Ran - Criterion Collection]]\\" could have STAYED with the Criterion Collection.  I get the impression a few others out there feel the same way.

0143038419|5.0|After I finished reading Gilbert's book, I loaned it to my daughter who unequivocally loved it and has yet to return it. I will probably end up buying another copy and reading it, again, after which I will I will post yet another review.    With this book, author Elizabeth Gilbert has brilliantly capitalized - wittingly or not - on the old Hollywood axiom, \\"The only bad publicity is no publicity.\\" With 2,000 plus, passionately polarized Amazon.com customer reviews to her credit, an appearance on Oprah's show that was tantamount to canonization for \\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" and a movie deal that includes Julia Roberts, as Gilbert, I could have easily sided with the naysayers who ripped into this book. But it wasn't that simple.     Obviously, the book inspired strong ambivalent reactions in me. But whenever I found myself feeling most judgmental, I (reluctantly) asked myself where all that vehemence was coming from. Almost invariably, I found that envy was at the root of my most critical reactions Face it, Gilbert took risks in defying moral conventions, in ways that many of us only wish we could. And, oh-how-dare-she have emerged a winner, besides!       For many, immutable dissatisfaction is not a (morally) acceptable reason for terminating a marriage But unlike most people who decide to exit a marriage for ostensibly \\"selfish\\" reasons, Gilbert didn't blame her ex-husband for her own unhappiness, nor did she scapegoat him, by way of justifying her subsequent actions. Instead, she took on full emotional, financial and ethical responsibility for making a choice that she, repeatedly questioned, even as she continued to go through the motions of securing a divorce.     I came to see it as a case of Gilbert having taken a leap of faith beyond marriage, into a voyage of self-discovery, without having known ahead of time exactly what was impelling her. The post-divorce odyssey through Italy, India and Indonesia struck me as being the kind of trip that Gilbert, perhaps, should have undertaken before settling into marriage with anyone. At worst, she's guilty of having taken a somewhat backwards approach to becoming a fully mature adult. And she's hardly alone in that tendency.     To those of you who refused to finish reading the book, you missed out on discovering that Gilbert is definitely not just some vain-glorious diarist. Though as my own former therapist was wont to remind me, \\"Selfishness is not necessarily a bad thing,\\" to having added with oracle-like gravity, \\"Any woman who actually gets what she wants out of life, has had to learn to suffer with being referred to as a `bitch'. Learn to embrace your bitch side.\\"     Gilbert, like most western women, was probably taught (consciously or otherwise) from the time she was a tiny girl, to think of self-interest as being a very undesirable character trait. Female children are taught to be of service to others, whereas male children are encouraged to have adventures apart from the constraints of other-centered commitments. Or I'm guessing that nearly all the virulent critics of \\"Eat, Pray, Love,\\" were probably most offended by the fact Gilbert is an iconoclast in having boldly challenged western proscriptions regarding women's role in marriage and society.      I'll go so far as to assert that if a man had written this book, the catty reactions would be nil. Instead, the readers would have focused on the details of the lone journey into self-actualization and spiritual enlightenment.

B00006DEFA|2.0|People always gripe about Hollywood executives who smoosh directors' visions, but if this movie is any indication, they sometimes see things much more clearly than the directors.<br /><br />\\"Amadeus\\" has always been one of my favorite movies, but I've never had a copy.  Finally I thought, \\"Why not?\\" and ordered this.  Heck, let's get the director's cut, as that's bound to be better.<br /><br />No way.  The movie is much worse.  All those scenes that wound up on the cutting room floor?  Watch this and you'll realize why they were left there.  Constance's topless visit with Salieri poisons the emotion of the rest of the film, and many of the other scenes that were included slog the pacing and focus.  The original film made every point it wanted to make without any of them:  why couldn't they just have been added as \\"deleted scenes\\"?  Or why couldn't we have the option of seeing film \\"in original theatrical format\\" or \\"with deleted scenes interlarded\\" or something.<br /><br />Argghghghh.  Now somebody's gone and ruined one of my favorite films.  I'm going to have to go and buy the original somewhere.
B001SAHOBO|4.0|Enjoyed the story line, especially since it was based on a real person.  However, the subtitles were incorrectly translated in many places.  I love Donnie Yen and his martial arts, also the  fight choreography by Sammo Hung was well done. The story line of Japan invading China and the cruelty of the soldiers was rather disturbing since I am Japanese-American.  However, I am aware of the atrocities committed by them - as was depicted in Bruce Lee's movies also.  I enjoyed the history of Ip Man and understand where Bruce got his WuShu training.

B001KZVQJI|5.0|I am hard pressed to think of any greater remake of a classic film! Peter Jackson pays homage to the original blockbuster film KING KONG of 1933. So many scenes, down to the nuances are remade to perfection in this classic. The acting is fantastic and the action is unbelievable. Some of the greatest CGI work of our time is done in this film. You will believe this 25' ape is living and breathing on screen with Naomi Watts. If you have never seen the original, it is a story of a filmaker that sets sail for a prehistoric island. This place where civilized man has yet to step foot, where mysterious wonders await. When the damsel in distress is captured she is offered up to Kong as a sacrifice. The crew saves her and captures the beast for display and profit. Soon Kong is loose and recaptures the fair maiden. This leads to one of film's alltime great moments as Kong battles bi-planes at the top of the Empire State Building!<br /><br />King Kong is a classic and Peter Jackson's love for it, is on full display. The movie is long as it should be. Great storytelling should never take shortcuts! A must own for any movie lover!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Universal does it again! The picture and sound are breathtakingly beautiful. This disc gives you both the theatrical and extended versions. Please watch the extended, it is so worth it. Unfortunately there are no special features. This is upsetting for someone who has the 3 disc extended edition. FINAL THOUGHTS: Even with the lack of special features, this is a must own blu-ray. Demo caliber disc. ABSOLUTELY UPGRADE!

B000OT6V00|4.0|Based on the comics created by Mike Mignola and directed by fan and filmmaker Guillermo Del Toro. The movie begins with Hellboy's origins of how he was brought to earth in the 1940's via a thwarted Nazi occult experiment. He is thus raised as a warrior for good in the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.  The B.P.R.D. also sports an amphibious telepath (Abe) and a pyrokinetic (Liz). Together they must take down the very same villains that brought Hellboy to Earth. Led by Rasputin, they seek to bring back the evil god Ogdru Jahad and the end of the world!<br /><br />Hellboy is great fun. Fans of the comics will love this adaptation as well! There's a new hero in town and he's BIG and RED!<br /><br />NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: Stunning picture and sound. My 50' HD plasma was filled with great darks and colors! A must own Blu Ray. Many of the special features from the 3 disc director's cut are carried over. Unfortunately the cast commentary is gone. FINAL THOUGHTS: It would be a BIG RED mistake not to upgrade! UPGRADE WORTHY!

B00006I53S|3.0|It's an okay lens for a travel lens in that price range. The range pretty much covers everything I need to do on trips, but I now prefer to just take my EF-S kit lenses with me (18-55 and 55-250). The 28-135 is quite soft, has a bit of zoom creep and has some difficult focusing in low light or indoors (just focus manually then). It still takes nice pictures and I usually stop it at f8 if I really want it to be sharper. I prefer to do as little post-processing as possible and I find the two kit lenses produce better and sharper results for me for around the same price. Bear in mind, the build of the kit lenses isn't quite as solid and heavy as the 28-135, but I don't mind less weight on the camera.

B000002540|4.0|I'm a huge fan not only of BOC, but live rock music in general. Live music captures the energy and beauty of music like few studio recordings do. That said, I think it was a good move on Sony's part to decide not to go back and remaster this album like they've done with the early BOC studio records. They left the raw sound well enough alone, and let the music speak for itself.    BOC have released several live albums throughout their 35+ year career, each representing a different era. On Your Feet was the very first of these albums, recorded before the days of Godzilla and Burnin' for You at a series of shows in Seattle, Portland, and New York. As someone who still goes to BOC shows today when their tour brings them through Seattle, it's interesting to go back and listen to this album and see how the songs have evolved musically since the 70s.     Songs like Before the Kiss and Hot Rails to Hell haven't changed much over the years, whereas tunes like Then Came the Last Days of May, ME262 and Harvester of Eyes have undergone significant metamorphosis in the interim. Some songs, like The Subhuman, don't ever really get played anymore and it's nice to have such a stellar rendition on record.     As anyone whose seen the band in the last few years can attest, the band's musical prowess has improved greatly since 1975 and their sound has aged like a fine wine. Still, it's fun to go back and listen to albums like this that perfectly capture the raw energy and angst of a bunch of early 20-somethings who just love playing music together.    On Your Feet is a obligatory purchase for fans of BOC and classic rock music alike. It's a classic rock staple, a perfect time capsule representing a different era.    Go support BOC next time their On Tour Forever tour brings them through your town, you won't regret it.
B000ZOXDFA|4.0|This movie may not be everyone's cup of tea, as it's dense on politics at times, and gruesome at others. However, for those reviewers who claim this film demonstrates religious bigotry, I beg to differ. Written and visual portraits from this time period reveal that the Spanish did indeed behave and dress the way they appeared in the film. Dour, black-wearing, bearded, somber, and convinced that Elizabeth was an Infidel who deserved to be destroyed. In addition, Philip II's infirmities and strange physique were portrayed as they truly were at the time; the House of Hapsburg and its various branches was becoming so inbred in early modern Europe that many of its members were physically deformed. This is no different than discussing how that the House of Tudor, for whatever physical/genetic reasons, clearly had reduced fertility during Henry VIII's time and afterward -- and saying so is hardly anti-Protestant prejudice. These are historical facts, and histories of the time period make them abundantly clear.     The movie does not try to absolve Elizabeth from all religious prejudice; indeed, it does show her ministers' gruesome vengeance  -- with confessions extracted from torture -- against Catholics suspected of plotting her demise. However, it is important to keep in mind that context of the times, and that the religious wars were brutal across Europe. Compared to the Spanish Inquisition, Elizabethan England was far less violent.     Her reign was also less violent than her father Henry VIII's by far -- he whose rule saw widespread oppression and terrorism against Catholics and Protestants alike, depending on how the religious/political winds were blowing across Europe at any given moment, and given the views and actions of Henry's enemies/allies/wives/lovers of any given moment.     Frankly, I find it hard to believe that even the most devout of Catholics of today would still claim that it would have been better for autocratic Spain, which had practically NO democratic tradition, and in which the Inquisition against Protestants, Jews, Muslims, accused heretics, etc. etc. was in full swing, to have conquered England in 1588.... The movie is also very useful in demonstrating how Elizabeth's victories and her enduring rule were in large part a result of her turning herself into a quasi-religious icon for her realm -- something the first film in the series makes even more clear -- and the price she had to pay for that decision. Subtle people will detect the subtleties in the film, and appreciate them. People with a major religious axe to grind, however, probably will not.

B000024E9M|2.0|I am a bit dismayed with tastes now-a-days...  I am not too old, not too young.  This album was originally recorded, mixed and mastered a couple years before I was born and I hate to say it, but those efforts were way more sublime and appropriate for this album, an album of delicate and articulate material.    It seems some of the original tracks could not be found for this remix.  The most beautiful and endearing vocals ever delivered by Gabriel open the original mixes of this album.  But on this version those a capella opening lines are very noticeably different form the original mixes and here on this remix sound more like a patch work of two or three takes.  Overall very weak and enough to ruin this re-presentation of Selling England By The Pound for this listener.    As seems to be the case with all of these Nick Davis re-mixes, the stereo mix definitely took the back-seat to the surround mix.  Sometimes the mix feels congested, nasal in the mid-range, sometime vocals are in that mid-range jumble and sometimes they jump into you lap.  I dare say I think ONLY the 5.1 mixes were created or even cared about in this very ambitious Genesis re-mix project.  Most likely an automated, computer decided upon, stereo mix-down is what we are left with, those of us who still prefer 2 (or 2.1).      Nick did a good job on the definitive remasters, especially with The Lamb...  I would suggest sticking with those if you want to hear nicely EQed and cleaner versions of the original stereo mixes of any/all Genesis albums.  A lot of what was done by the original engineers and producers of those albums really did enhance and solidify Genesis' in-studio presence and overall musical presentation.
B0015DROBO|2.0|Just a short review as other low stars have said it all - this book is full of empty characters that think highly of themselves. The ending is absolutely ludicrous - I laughed out loud during a supposedly \\"dramatic\\" episode in a basement (and I am a huge fan of serial killer style movies). The book wants to somehow make a statement on the abuses towards women - and yet one strong female character is an anorexic very young women who makes herself a victim to men again and again. Even if she does have Asperger's, as is implied - this doesn't make her a brilliant nymph - she is a victim who seems to be used and abused by every male in the book! The main male character, Blomvkist, seems to be a strong believer in women's rights - which means he can sleep with any woman he wants and they shouldn't be offended - their independent! Ha - he is as bad as all the other characters in the book. And why is it rape scenes are so unbelievably graphic these days?<br /><br />I will not be reading any of the other series if it means having to read about a self-centered newspaper writer and a girl who is so different that she couldn't be anything less than a tragic victim.

B0000C7PQK|5.0|i've seen a few people on here talk about how they hate this albu, how they hate Michael Cretu's singing... WTF, if you hate his singing then stop listening to enigma, cos he IS enigma and his voice is amazin... and im glad he sings more on this album cos i love listening to his voice....    the album is different from other enigma albums, and its BETTER... and the reason i say this is because earlier enigma albums always have tracks that are only a mintue or so long, normally the opener, and the closer which in my mind is a totally waste of a track   (the 3rd of its kind... whats the point of that?)      its not the best enigma album, but it kicks 7 shades of &&^%& out of the first 2 albums... i love sadeness and return to innocence as much as the next guy, but get over it, the albums are old and boring these days...    its not as good as Enigma 3, which i think is one of the best albums, even though it has pointless tracks on it (oddasey of the mind? wtf is that?)

0670021652|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert's Committed is a wonderful historical account of marriage as well as a subjective source for evaluating marriage.  She includes many useful quotes throughout that make you consider your own marital journey.  In the end she indicates feeling at peace with marriage, but I'm not sure she's convinced.  Since many share this feeling of skepticism, Committed is a work for both divorced, married, and re-married readers.  Her writing is entertaining and leaves you wanting more.  After Gilbert's journey to heal from her divorce in Eat, Pray, Love she finds herself forced to marry again.  Even though she's clearly in love with this man, marriage is an institution she's not quite buying into.

After mentioning my boredom to a few readers I decided to return to the book with an open mind and I truly enjoyed it.  Her journey to heal after a difficult divorce touched me.  Many would love the opportunity to travel while healing from the brokeness of divorce.  Elizabeth Gilbert's writing style is truly wonderful.  I enjoyed her spirit while meeting people and making just about everyone her friend.  I agreed with her aversion to marriage and questioned marriage.  I purchased Committed shortly after completing Eat, Pray, Love since my curiousity about how she made peace with marriage was nagging.  I find her to be intellectually stimulating.  Gilbert makes profound, but realistic comments throughout the book.

B002BSHWUU|1.0|Reading several of the reviews, what several of these buyers have are bootleg copies, not the real thing. Karl Johnson, with the messed up booklets and KLL with the greasy CD's etc. Things to look for on the bootleg copies are---Check the back of Revolver, the boys names are mis-spelled !! The White Album should have a folded poster just like the original album. The bootlegs dont have it. Also the booklet problems mentioned before. As to the quality of the bootleg copies, I havent listened to all of the Cd's yet, and only have one authentic disc to compare with. But it seems the bootlegs have a little more distortion on some of the recordings, and dont seem to have as good of separation. However on the other side many of the bootleg recordings are about as good as the legit ones. I have both a legit & bootleg copy of one of the Past Masters CD's and compared and there were only 2-3 songs where I thought the legit was clearly better. Just make sure of which you are getting before you buy..NICK
1400063515|5.0|I consider The Black Swan one of the most influential books in my life.  I reread it several times, and each time I discovered some nuances relevant to whatever I was working on at the time.  The book is truly timeless.    The Black Swan does not teach you *what* to do.  It crisply describes the concept in the Introduction and then presents this concept from different angles -- many angles, widely different angles, with philosophical, historical and personal narratives behind them.  Some reviewers here find this approach repetitive or verbose.  I think such criticism is misguided.  If all one wants to know is the Black Swan concept, the book is not necessary.  Reading reviews (including some Amazon.com reviews) would suffice.    The problem is that knowing the Black Swan concept is not enough.  The nature of Black Swans is such that it is impossible to provide a concrete advice for what to do about them.  A Black Swan is an event that catches you completely unprepared and leaves you affected for life.  A short book could pursue one of the two venues.  Either it would proclaim that any resistance is futile and we are doomed.  Or it would concoct some protection against Black Swans and try sell it to gullible readers. An intelligent book should, on the other hand, provide the reader with all relevant information and teach him to face the unforeseen.    And so Taleb describes Black Swans from the historical, philosophical, social, medical, biological, scientific, economic, personal, and other points of view.  As soon as you internalize the Black Swan principle, you start seeing Black Swans everywhere.  This is not an optical illusion; it is a removal of a long-engraved blind spot.  Over the years Taleb has collected a wealth of the Black Swan evidence; in the book he shares his findings so that the reader can recognize Black Swans, too.    Taleb does not \\"train\\" in Black-Swan avoidance; he \\"educates\\" about their habits and known manifestations.  When the book finally gets to you, you become highly skeptical about every major aspect of your professional and personal life.  You become less idealistic but also more wise and alert.  This could not be achieved with mere recital of facts; this was possible through innovative metaphors, original narratives and reinforcements of the key principles.  Dealing with the Black Swans requires openmindness and the book opens one's mind.    Buy this book for the wisdom you will gain from it, for the deep appreciation of the things that we just don't know, for the Aha moments on virtually every page.

The way each player approaches the same instrument--and the brilliant results each achieves--is a testament to the raw power of creativity.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|I think I had to listen to Soldier 3x in order to fully appreciate and understand Sade's latest body of work.  I saw her behind the scenes making the album and I could definitely tell that this came from a sad place.  I think that as she gets older she explores a more somber sound.  The more you live the more you suffer and have things to talk about.  Today's music market is about happy or lascivious music with no content.  I think that it is harder appreciate this album is one likes to chase trends.      I think that one has to listen to what's left unsaid when listening to Sade.  She doesn't come out and grab you, but she gets you after a while.  I love how her voice has deepened over the years.    This album helps me to better relate to man's relationship to suffering, life struggles and the overall cycle of life.  We may life in a high tech world, but we can't escape these very salt of the earth topics.  We can't overcome our basic human condition which is to love, laugh, cry, scream and ultimately die.    I do think that Sade intentionally set out to create such a somber album that mainly talked about people's inner emotional states and their disappointments.  Listening to it gave me an 'it's okay, there's many people who feel as bad as you' do sort of vibe without making you feel sorry for yourself and resorting to drama queen antics like some singers out there.  Sade's like the quiet friend that's stuck by you over the years who has watched you grow, laugh, cry and consoles you without asking too many questions.    What stopped me from giving it 5 stars is that I wish it had more songs and that it was longer in length.  Sometimes the album did become a bit much of a downer for me.
B002436WFI|2.0|I love Terry Pratchett. I even love most of the actors in this film but I agree with the folks who didn't think this works: it doesn't. The portrayal of Rincewind is quite good and Cohen is effortless. Everyone else is less than successful.   I think it's because in order to properly play a Pratchett character, you have to be a character actor. Sean Astin, a great talent, is great for playing realistic characters. His Twoflower is dreadful. The stilted I'm-reading-lines delivery is like summerstock quality acting. From Astin, this was both a shock and a real disappointment. I didn't even care that he's not Asian like Twoflower is supposed to be: he just isn't good. Most of the cast are like this. Tim Curry plays Tim Curry, as always, so it didn't feel at all like Pratchett. Just felt like Tim Curry. A few of the side characters do very well but the material is not well-scripted. Somehow the translation got from page to script without any of the timing that makes the humor work. Lines are slowly said, huge pauses grow between the question and response...the editing and timing just sucked the film dry. Visually they did very well on a TV budget but certain elements jar: elaborate velvet robes on the wizards work but putting Rincewind in a button-down oxford shirt under it made it seem again like amateur theater. It takes you completely out of the moment.  another example is a huge overuse of one 20' wall set of the Unseen University: you see it so much, you realize they built just this tiny peice and it again takes you out of the moment. Also it's boring. Likewise a lot of fans must have been used for crowd scenes: it shows obviously.   Because it's made for TV, the FX are sort of mediocre. The dragon fight hanging upside down apparently was terribly hard to film and that's too bad: it's cropped so close and cut up so much it's impossible to follow what's supposed to be happening. The action sequences are so clunky and slow that I suspect the director is at fault formuch of this; there's just zero tension. Any movie involving Rincewind is mostly action as he spends his life running. Somehow, there's no speed to any of this production. It's just slow, choppy, akward.   And like Hogfather, if you aren't already aware of Discworld, nothing is explained to you, which leaves half the elements feeling like in-jokes. Why did Vetinari have to have his little dog? Anyone not a fan wouldn't know the difference and any fan would know we've never seen him with the dog. It's a good example of a detail included for the fan-base that is superflous and inaccurate. It's almost insulting--if you don't know about it, you don't need it and if you do, it's wrong. Jeremy Irons' Vetinari is actually pretty good though the lisp was annoying but again, script pacing and timing of pretty much everything needed to be rethought and re-edited. It would've been 40 minutes shorter but maybe it would've been good. And good grief, get actors who can handle characters that walk the line between real and allegoric.
B001UW58WW|5.0|I loved this CD.  First heard the artist on a PBS program and found him to be incredibly entertaining.  Had to have a CD and will in all probability buy another.
B00138KGS4|5.0|Kurt Cobain consistently called this the best hard rock album of all time. I'm starting to suspect he was right.<br /><br />Raw Power is not simply a great album, or even a classic piece of hard rock; it's one of those rare albums that's so incredible you'll find yourself wondering how you survived without it. Like most everything that I've gone stark raving mad over, I've found myself enthusing about it with other apostles and fervently preaching its merits to the unconverted. I was in such a conversation with one of my buddies when he said, \\"Lemme guess...it's raw and it's powerful.\\"<br /><br />Well, yes and no.<br /><br />It starts out just the way you'd expect an album called \\"Raw Power\\" to start: with a hard charging guitar riff, and one of the best opening lines in all of rock: \\"I'm a streetwalking cheetah with a heart full of napalm.\\" Iggy and the Stooges tear through \\"Search and Destroy\\" (probably the best song about the Vietnam War ever) with a frightening intensity, but it is the second track that really sealed the album for me; there's a delicacy here--and on \\"Penetration\\" and \\"I Need Somebody\\"--that is truly delightful. Yes, it's raw and powerful, but it is also many other things besides; the musical texture is both consistent enough to be cohesive and varied enough to be interesting. The guitars go from smoky and slow to fast and furious, but Iggy's a charismatic enough frontman to stay in front of it all; he's growling feral dog one minute and a wailing banshee the next, and throughout it all, there's an intensity and emotion and hook you in and keep you there.<br /><br />That's not just sharp musicianship; it's sharp writing, too. Iggy's not just out to just skewer easy targets, but to express complex truths, and to take a critical look at himself as well. \\"Hallucination, true romance, I needed love but I only dropped my pants,\\" he wails on \\"Your Pretty Face is Going to Hell.\\" Three tracks later, he moans, \\"I need some money, baby. I need somebody, too. I need somebody baby, just like you.\\" Lyrically (if not musically) it sounds like just another lost soul singing the blues; he grumbles about how \\"you bring me to the end,\\" but then--unlike so many others--he's man enough to admit: \\"But still I don't mind it!\\"<br /><br />For whatever reason, it took me a long time to check this out, and like some of my favorite albums, I didn't get into it right away. (As many reviewers have commented, this version, remastered by Iggy in 1997, is a rough, abrasive mix; the Bowie-mastered Legacy Edition's a little smoother, and I tend to like it more on the louder songs and less on the softer songs. Still, that's not a commentary on the idiosyncrasies of this master, but on the overall strength of the album. It's an essential work, and essential works are not frozen in perfection but are instead the result of a long creative process involving multiple people; sometimes what emerges is a singular definitive version, but often one gets mixes and remixes and alternate takes, and critical opinion that doesn't gel around any one version but instead settles into opposing camps.) As for me, I got the Bowie version when it came back out, but I still listen to this one more frequently; it's one of my go-to albums, particularly when I'm at work and I get some unexpected urgent task from the boss and need a little musical motivation to get me going. I blast it to the point that one of my co-workers will hear it over my earbuds and warn me about hearing loss; \\"But still I don't mind it!\\" I say, until I ponder the fact that destroying my eardrums with this album will deprive me of my ability to destroy my eardrums with this album. Is it a case of destroying them to save them from the mediocrity of other music? Perhaps. \\"Raw power got a healing hand, raw power can destroy a man,\\" Iggy raves on the title track, and he's right on both counts.ke you.\\" Lyrically (if not musically) it sounds like just another lost soul singing the blues; he grumbles about how \\"you bring me to the end,\\" but then--unlike so many others--he's man enough to admit: \\"But still I don't mind it!\\"    For whatever reason, it took me a long time to check this out, and like some of my favorite albums, I didn't get into it right away.

B002WCLG48|3.0|First off let me say,if you're a hardcore or even a not so hardcore halo fan  this is a must for your collection.   But for the most part I was left with a luke warm feeling for this dvd. Like a previous poster said The  two origin stories... gold. I believe it was well drawn, animated, and the story, excellent.  Prototype, and the Package also are excellent in it self. I watched those  three a few times already. Now the rest like I said- left me with en Eh feeling. The dual  despite a unique animation style, whhich impressed me., I felt the director took too many creative liberites and strayed away from  halo universe, and for most westerners, the setting, may seem a little to forgein.  The babysister, awesome story, I was glad to see the realtionship between Spartans and Odsts- but I was disappointed with the effort put into the animation. Odd man out, very funny, I chuckled a few time but to cliche for my taste. this style should be saved for something like DBZ and not halo. Lastly  Homecoming. This story should have been omitted from the dvd- personally I did not like it all. Poor animation, soft story line, disappointing over all.   I am a halo fan If I  had the chance to buy this again I would, but overall I feel that this Dvd was rushed and could have been better
B000ZN802W|3.0|Chris McCandless graduates Emory University in Atlanta with grades good enough to \\"get into Harvard Law\\" and his parents are jazzed and want to buy him a new car. Chris is not jazzed though about his parents version of the American Dream and its materialism and making a good impression on the neighbors. Chris is real intelligent and thoughtful and does not want to live in the work-a-day world and save for retirement - he wants to LIVE. So, he donates his law school money to charity and hits the road.<br /><br />For such a smart guy who did well in college for himself and learned about things that interested him, he does make a couple of dumb mistakes - like not reading road signs or important books.<br /><br />This film is wonderfully filmed, especially the slow motion water scenes, and written and directed by Sean Penn who puts his all into this film like he does with his acting roles. Emile Hirsch is very strong in the role of Chris and has to change his body and look as Chris lives off the land - more famine than feast.<br /><br />Chris meets some cool, interesting people along the way - but, some of these encounters seem forced like the Danes along the Colorado River. Chris also learns some deep, dark family secrets - but, are they enough to make him seek his new kind of American Dream, alone in the wilderness like our forefathers?
B002T9H2ME|1.0|This movie didn't really do anything for me.  It was just a variation of the theme of a person isolated from other people. It didn't even bring anything new about the theme to the table.  This type of situation has been done so many times before (Castaway, Robinson Crusoe, I Am Legend, etc.)in ways that I thought were more interesting.  Copying HAL from 2001 didn't help in the originality department, either.  I have to admit I couldn't get into the movie from the beginning because I couldn't believe they would send ONE person into space for three years-  ONE person!  After that, I just couldn't get into it (so I probably missed/forgot some things). I also think that a clone of someone wouldn't have such a different personality from the original person if that clone had only been in that kind environment. If they can clone him, why don't they just have a bunch of clones up there?  They'd get things done in a lot shorter time than three years.   Also, why did it take him almost three years to go nearly insane?  I probably would have lost it after three days.    This movie was directed by David Bowie's son.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|The Mumfords are the hottest property in the UK at the present, just check out Winter Winds to see why. It is a roaring joy of a track, a brassy, processional pop song full of banjos and horns. It's wintry in a \\"Fairytale of New York\\" way and lead singer Marcus Mumford delivers better than Parcel force. \\"Sigh no More\\" comes with a health warning, it is so addictive that you become a total bore amongst your friends because of frequent rants about its wonders. Who are the Mumfords? The NME tells us with pinpoint accuracy that the band was \\"Formed in late 2007 through a shared love of country, bluegrass and folk, the Mumford's belong to a clique that's already scaled grand artistic peaks; performers such as Laura Marling and Noah And The Whale taking the shambling, confessional style of the New York anti-folk scene and fleshing it out for broader commercial appeal\\". Check out the many clips on you tube and you will see a band of fresh faced folkies, decked out in waistcoats and beards having the time of their life. To the acts above you could also add a Pogues influence, a bit of the Macabees and in Marcus's voice is the passion heard in a young Peter Gabriel. I suppose the nearest US equivalent would be the Avett Brothers in terms of the fire and dynamism of their live act.<br /><br />The songs are all very strong but to single out a few for your attention the lovely ballad \\"After the storm\\" is achingly beautiful and what a mature work for such a young band. Similarly the single \\"Little Lion Man\\" is a banjo driven foot tapper but with superb lyrics and story. Other standouts include the initially soothing \\"I gave you all\\" which is a slow burner that builds to an excellent and powerful crescendo. Mention in dispatches should also go to Waterboys \\"Fisherman blues\\" era stomp \\"Roll away your stone\\" and the excellent high tempo folk of \\"Thistle and Weeds\\" and the sheer passion of \\"White Blank Page\\". I have in candour not yet found a real duffer on this album which is hugely impressive and with the \\"The Cave\\" they have recorded one of the songs of 2009. I have recently heard Mumfords songs not on this album including \\"Sister\\" available free from their website, the lovely \\"Liar\\" and a corking covers of Calvin Harris's \\"Im not alone\\" and the Beatles \\"Golden Slumbers/Carry that Weight\\". There is clearly strength in depth with this band and talent to spare.<br /><br />It's great to see that Jo Whiley, Zane Lowe and Greg James from BBC Radio 1 have enthused and championed this album. I have seen some reviews of \\"Sigh no More\\" suggesting that it is too angst ridden or alternatively (and in contradiction) it's a bunch of posh kids discovering that folk can be fun. Its not perfect(it comes close) but for a debut oozes huge potential and places a hefty weight of lofty expectation on a precociously and massively talented new band.ive and with the \\"The Cave\\" they have recorded one of the songs of 2009.

B002T45VX6|5.0|I started out not liking this one much and the more I listened the more I enjoyed it.  \\"Like a Gypsy\\" one of my favorites.  Full of rhythm, makes you want to dance or sing or both.  Full of soul especially if you have a little latin blood.  Full of fun, great music for a heavy traffic day - no bad feelings here.  Listen a couple of times - well worth the price and the time!
B0013FNC38|5.0|Wow!  I was driving long distance recently, listening to one CD after another in the car stereo, and this one really stood out well above the others.  In my opinion, this is one of the most enjoyable CDs released in at least the last 10 years.  The music is awesome, most of the lyrics are fun, interesting, and/or thought provoking, and the whole CD just flows from one song to another.  An absolutely wonderful experience!
B00337KM2S|5.0|The film begins by showing us views taken from the plane; you know that sense of everything being so far down there, so unreal and disconnected from you.  I believe most people have the feeling of isolation when on a plane that things below look so small and insignificant with distinctly defined lines and markings.  This is in fact true of Ryan Bingham (Georgorgeous Clooney)who prides himself on being unencumbered by any ties, who spends the biggest part of his life flying from state to stete, laying people off.  The role his job has trained him to play, namely to be cooly polite and calmly aloof is the one he has espoused in real life.  In other words his work role and his real life role are one and the same thing.  Thus he has estranged himself from his family and friends, being content with the casual affairs and acquaintances he makes along the way, safely detached from his emotions.    Up In The Air is Ryan's life, but it is also the life of the people who are suddenly told that they are no longer required, whose years of dedicated hard work and devotion are \\"downsized\\" in a thin file Ryan hands them, telling them of the  meagre benefits contained therein. And those devastated people ask themselves \\"what now?\\"  It is also a harsh look at a world where the  huge corporates have eliminated personal relationships among employers and employees, the latter being just anonymous beings to be sacked with no concern or consideration for their personal plight.  The transience and uncertainty of the work concept today is exposd in what I considered a brutal yet totally realistic way. Our future, professionally at least, is most certainly, \\"up in the air\\".    As part of his job, Ryan gives lectures to colleagues on how to be more effective and efficient by unburdening themselves of all that 'impedes' their lives including relatives and friends. It is a cold blooded, callous attitude which wins him fame, admiration and recognition. What surprised me, was that Ryan remainedlikeable and appealing as a personality. I was taken aback at the realization that this must be how these people are in real life and not the heartless monsters I envisioned.    Ryan's dream of attaining the ten million flier miles that only six people have ever achieved, is threatened when young employee, Natlie Keenan, (played by Anna Kendrick), proposes  using a teleconfrencing method to lay off employees. This will save the company millions on staff expenses so the boss is eager to put this method into practice.  Ryan Bingham is enraged as he does not believe this can realistically be successful and of course it would mean a total reversal of his one suitcase lifestyle. He takes Natalie on a what seems to be a last trip to show her first hand how the system works.  Perhaps because his own routine is threatened, he begins to see Vera Farmiga as more than a casual affair to be enjoyed when their schedules coincide.  He even asks her to accompany him to his niece's wedding as he has become sick of being the one who is always unaccompanied, with no dancing partner.    George Clooney is perfectfor the role, using his cool detachment, suave appearance and wry humour, to bring off the character of Ryan Bingham superbly. Vera Farmiga is perfect as the female version of Ryan, his female alter ego in fact. Jason Reitman successfully managed to convey the multiple levels and the subtle implications of being \\"up in the air\\". The film shocked me with its candid ruthlessness, it made me laugh with its humour, it depressed me with its harsh reality.  I came out of the cinema feeling as if a bucket of ice had been emptied over me.  I fear that the situations the film depicts are very much with us. There is a ray of hope which comes from the strength and support gained from our personal relationships that seem to be the only stability and certainty in life.  That was a consolation, at least.  But don't go unprepared like me who,for some reason, expected to see a light comedy.

B00004RITP|4.0|I know that there are other recommendable recordings out there, but comparison of these two makes sense to me for several reasons, practical and aesthetic: one, I own them both; two, they are both excellent; three, they represent contrasting, very different but equally successful interpretative stances.<br /><br />Rattle's version has attracted far more attention and many more reviews, for obvious reasons, but don't let that, in combination with the fact that his Mahler cycle as a whole might not be up there with the front runners, lead you to dismiss Inbal. For some reason, Inbal and his Frankfurt orchestra really came into their own for this one.<br /><br />Broadly speaking, Rattle's view of this wonderful symphony, in the equally admirable completion (OK - &#34;performing version&#34;) by Deryck Cooke, is typical of his strengths (reflected in his latest Brahms symphony cycle) and weaknesses (an enervated and static Requiem by the same composer) as a conductor. Occasionally, he relies too heavily on too ponderous an approach which can cause his interpretation to plough into the sand and choke. Here, although he favours much broader tempi and phrasing than Inbal, I think he gets away with it: this is a grand, monumental 10th, far more tragic and reflective than Inbal's nervier, more propulsive and hopeful account. Thus, some find Rattle nerveless and cold, others find a stately beauty in his more reserved approach.<br /><br />Both versions enjoy superb sound. Rattle's is spliced from two live performances and is slightly rounder and duller - or perhaps less edgy? - than Inbal's brighter studio recording; either way, the ambience provided complements each conductor's artistic choices. Inbal's woodwind is more pungent but there is more sheen on the Berlin strings - which could be the result of both their innate orchestral sound and the engineering. Both orchestras play superbly, although some find an echo of too much smoothness in the BPO's strings - a remnant of the Karajan era, they complain.<br /><br />Movement by movement, the same generalisations are confirmed in the details: the opening is more resigned and yet more tender, too, under Rattle; more violent and heroic under Inbal, especially in the shattering, climactic, nine-note dissonance and the A-flat minor chorale. Both Scherzos are weightier and more refined under Rattle; more rustic, unbuttoned and even vulgar under Inbal, especially in the L&auml;ndler sections. I love the way Inbal's brass screams and howls in the second Scherzo; Rattle is almost too civilised by comparison. In the tiny, central &#34;Purgatorio&#34; movement, Rattle brings darker sonorities and colouring, Inbal is sharper.<br /><br />The interpretation of the vast final movement could be a clincher for some listeners: the otherworldly beauty of the flute's theme leading into the concluding cantabile section is exquisitely played by Rattle and the BPO; his broader tempo and their singing strings impart a profound melancholy which offers less of a sense of resignation and consolation than Inbal's vibrancy. Both make much of the bitterly ironic quotations from &#34;Das Lied von der Erde&#34;. One crucial detail stands out for me: I much prefer the way in which Inbal secures a real swooping, Mahlerian portamento from the Frankfurt strings on that last leaping sixth skywards; Rattle's is almost diffident in its polite timidity.<br /><br />In the last analysis, I prefer Inbal's heart-wrenching humanity to Rattle's bleaker, more detached stateliness, but make no mistake: both are deeply moving, wholly recommendable recordings.Movement by movement, the same generalisations are confirmed in the details: the opening is more resigned and yet more tender, too, under Rattle; more violent and heroic under Inbal, especially in the shattering, climactic, nine-note dissonance and the A-flat minor chorale.

The theatre release does not convey the creepiness of the story that the initial scenes provide.  Also, there is a lovely musical number cut from the theatre release.<br /><br />The comments by the actors on the 2 DVD set are wonderful if you want to get a sense of the impact this cult classic has in Scotland and around the world.  It's very Seventies, with background on the lesser known character actors, poetry and music incorporated into the film.

He ADORES this thing.  It is extremely solidly built, his match box cars fit on it, he can do the elevator by himself, and he just loves it.  I can't rave enough about this toy.

B0031OCY2E|4.0|Most average film makers would have been content to take this true story of coroporate greed and make into a thriller akin to \\"The Insider\\" or a comedy \\"Office Space\\". But Steve Soderbergh is not one of them. An eye for the eccentric and an effortless style has always been his trademarks. None of the scenes in the movie seem forced. Some people maybe put off by the hyper background score. That is probably because they don't comprehend the director's approach to the movie.     Matt Damon is brilliant and so are the rest of the cast choc-a-bloc with stand-up comedians. The voice over narration is a wonderful technique for letting us understand Whitacre's psyche better. It is almost Altman-ish. At every gag and turn you are left wondering, whether you are laughing at the joke or whether the joke is on you.
B0009IOR6Q|4.0|I would argue that the work of director John Waters and his Baltimore teen mania, circa 1955 type works are an acquired taste. And I have acquired the taste, having first gotten interested in his work through \\"Hairspray\\" that was revived on screen a couple of years ago. Of course, part of the draw is that the demographic territory that Waters surveys, circa 1955 teens, is very familiar turf to me. So when dear John spoofs a certain fashion, or a certain crowd, or a certain way of looking at things that were alien to the average teen back then he is giving off signals that I am attuned to. And that is the key; to know what is being spoofed, because the music is easy, very easy to figure out, the fight to get rock and roll to youth nation.    Of course, as is inevitable in a teen-based film, spoof or not, there is the central theme of sex. Here that theme centers on the orphan bad boy, Cry Baby played by Johnny Depp, who deep down inside really has a heart of gold matched up with an upscale orphan good girl, who deep down inside want to be bad. No, that last phrase won't work here, deep down wants to redeem Johnny-bad boy. Along the way to this inevitable happy-ending everything not nailed down gets spooked from 1950s suburban cookie cutter lifestyles to seemingly odd-ball teen fetishes like- French kissing and, oh no, the love of rock and roll. For my money the best spoof though, and it must have been hard to do with a straight face, are the musical performances of the quartet of pre-roll and rock teen singers(one, good/bad girl's beau, for a while) doing the cutesy songs made famous by male groups like The Letterman that were squeaky clean but upon hearing sounded like scratching on a chalk board. And, incidentally, drove me to blues, rock, and folk music in nothing flat.     Note: I haven't mentioned much about the performances here but for a long time now anything Johnny Depp appears in will get a look see, although it does not always turn out to be worthwhile. Hehas had a string of great roles, like in \\"Ed Wood\\", and some that it is better left unspoken like, \\"Sweeney Todd\\", but in this early film role (1990)as Cry Baby he gives a glimpse of why I will take a chance on any of his efforts. He does a beautiful parody of the James Dean/Elvis/Marlon Brando \\"rebel without a cause\\" style that the Cry Baby role called for.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Paramount execs must be hung over because they drank way too much champagne in celebration of the return of the Star Trek franchise. J.J. Abrams does a masterful job of crafting a watchable, fun film that respectfully pays homage to the previous Trek movies and TV shows. When is the next one going to be released? Will both the odd and even numbered movies in this run be excellent? I hope so! It was like a reunion to see these characters again and we got to know their backstories as well.<br /><br />The good guys, bad guys, sets and effects were all fantastic - welcome back Star Trek!
0198610572|4.0|Meets expectations but is somewhat outdated eg population stats are year 2000 stats so we expect many recent additions to the language will also be missing. Otherwise easy to use and reasonable value. We have loved the previous version to death so it has retired to the bedroom for those who cheat at crosswords.
B002XTBEDI|4.0|I enjoyed this second of the Cranford (I hope there will be more) series.  I must admit that I liked the first more.  The characters are so endearing and loveable that I almost wish I was there with them.  I did miss some of the actors that were in the first installment that were not in this one.  But I was so happy that most the cast was present for \\"Return to Cranford.\\" One cannot help but fall in love with these women as they deal with life changes and trials.  Keep it coming.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|The vision of the director and the visual effects are stunning. The motion capture cameras are a true technological marvel. No amount of animation or prosthetics could have made this possible. The imagination and creativity which went into creating pandorum and its inhabitants is mind boggling.     Alas great visual effects does not a movie make. With a wafer thin story line, you always put the movie in peril when you drag it out past the 2 hour mark. Also it seemed like the movie had an identity crisis - it seemed to shuttle between between the action genre as well as drama. But in the end fulfilling neither to satisfaction.     In summary, watch it for the visual effects. Don't expect anything more.

0790729407|2.0|I only knew the name Michael Collins before watching this film and now I know of his exploits, but I could have used some more backstory instead of \\"700 years of struggle.\\" Like why Liam Neeson's Collins and Aidan Quinn's Harry Boland are such great friends and why Alan Rickman's Eamon de Valera fear the both of them working together on the Irish Republican cause. So, my Irish history is rusty and this movie helps fill in some gaps, but I think more of the history of these folks struggle should have been shown.<br /><br />Julia Roberts' Kitty Kiernan is character who needed further development or she should have hit the cutting room floor. Why is she involved in the cause? Who does she love Michael or Harry? Is she a country lass or a city woman? Why is she in the film again? To me, it seemed like the actors were not as immersed in their roles as they should have been.
B0012GMW34|5.0|For those of you who enjoy soaring lyrical guitar, this is one is on the forefront for setting the path for great guitarists of this age to come along.  I am referring to the music of Joe Satriani, Uli Jon Roth and Steve Vai to name a few of the notables now.<br /><br />I have been fortunate enough to have been around for this CD's (then album) first release.  I have also been very fortunate to see them play this live in Chicago in 1973.<br /><br />This CD is timeless and does not sound \\"dated.\\"  From the blazing speed (McLaughlin, who was shredding before the term existed) to Carlos' singing vocal-like guitar, to the churning percussion of Chepito Areas and Billy Cobham, this music will find you breathless and mesmerized by it's mantra-like effect.<br /><br />Well worth the purchase.<br /><br />I wish that they would release live performances of this which I do know exists.
B0014E9188|5.0|They play everything from the album/studio to a T, but it's even better live. Amazing integration of players in a band. Sound quality excellent, the 5.1 is spot on. Gavin Harrison on Hatesong is especially \\"wow!\\"  5 stars all the way.
B001PPLJIQ|2.0|There have been numerous movies about the holocaust made until now. Each one of them has taken a different approach for narrating this devastating tragedy. Whether it was the direct approach in \\"Schindler's List\\" of painting he horrors explicitly or the subtle approach of \\"Life is Beautiful\\", they all conveyed the magnitude of the horror in their own ways.     But \\"The Reader\\" is different. Not in a good way. It tends to gloss over the horror in attempt to focus on the people involved. It almost amounts to intellectual dishonesty to do that. For the sake of giving the benefit of the doubt, I put that thought aisde. Even then the movie fails to work.     Clearly Hanna has a huge impact on Michael's life. Maybe to the extent of why his marriage failed. But the director never provides us true insight into that. So the movie fails even on the level of a love/lust story.     The 2.5 stars is mainly because of Kate Winslet's performance. The detachment, the veiled anguish are all portrayed in such a brilliant manner. Lena Olin does a brilliant cameo in probably the most powerful scene in the movie.
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Up / B001KVZ6G6<br /><br />I wasn't sure I'd enjoy \\"Up\\" - the previews all seemed like a stereotypically Grumpy Old Man who comes to appreciate the life that he turned his back on through the Power of Friendship, or something equally wholesome and two-dimensional.<br /><br />Of course, this is a good example of how previews just aren't everything. Our grumpy old man has a name, Carl, and it turns out he's not so grumpy after all - but he has suffered a terrible and heart-wrenching loss. Pixar is to be congratulated for managing, again, to really flesh out a character in scenes that involve little-to-no actual dialogue, and in such a surprisingly short time - after the first 15 minutes of the film, I can almost guarantee you will care more about Carl than you have for the protagonists of the last dozen films you've watched. (OK, mileage will vary there, but seriously, Pixar does a wonderfully direct and succinct job of making you care for Carl as a person.)<br /><br />There's so much to like about \\"Up\\". There's such a strong theme here of journeying to capture what you \\"lost\\", even if what you're trying to capture is something you never actually had. His tag-along friend, Russell, is also searching for something he has lost-yet-never-had, as he hopes that by finishing his merit badges, he might somehow regain the love that he remembers having from his father. If that doesn't break your heart, then nothing will. And the comic relief, Dug the Dog, is actually funny and heart-warming as well.<br /><br />To my surprise, I really, really enjoyed \\"Up\\". I'm not quite sure how to rate it, though - I'm very glad that I've seen it, but...I strangely don't feel the need to re-watch it, which is unusual for me. Maybe it's just that \\"Up\\" burns itself into your memory so indelibly, or maybe it's just because it's a real tear-jerker, and I hate to cry, but for whatever reason, I'd recommend this as a rental first, and not necessarily a buy. Not because the movie isn't wonderful - it is! - but because \\"Up\\" might leave such a strong impression on you that you might not *need* to see it again... at least not without a box of tissues nearby.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardollleave such a strong impression on you that you might not *need* to see it again... at least not without a box of tissues nearby.     ~ Ana Mardoll
0446364495|1.0|Everyone in my family read this book. We kept passing it to one another with the intro, \\"you have to read this. It's TERRIBLE.\\" Because we really wanted someone else in the house with whom we could discuss who TERRIBLE it was. And once we all read it, we spent many enjoyable meals talking about how much we hated it. So at least it fostered family unity. But the movie is much much better -- how often can you say that?
B000E1YVZU|5.0|Quick, hold up your hands and do the Macauley Culkin pose in \\"Home Alone.\\" You wouldn't think the director of this slapstick family film would later create a dramatic movie about love, loss, addiction and AIDS, with words such as dildos and S&M included in song.    But Chris Columbus did; and he delivered. His film version of Jonathan Larson's musical, \\"Rent,\\" is full of visual and emotional impact. The way he did one of the musical numbers alone makes the DVD worth owning. It's called, \\"Without You,\\" sung by Rosario Dawson and Adam Pascal.     In just four minutes, you experience:    - The devastation of drugs   Mimi (Dawson), spirals into the abyss of addiction. And if you think, \\"Yeah, but Rosario Dawson is hot,\\" well, she does a hell of a job inhabiting her inner junkie, and it ain't pretty. OK, maybe a little.    - The human impact of AIDS  As members of an AIDS support group talk, laugh and share their fears, some of them disappear one by one. You know they've been taken by the disease. It makes you see them as individuals, not statistics. When the camera falls on the character of Angel (Wilson Jermaine Heredia), you notice how pale he looks, and you think, \\"Oh noooooo...\\"    - The meaning of true friendship  When Angel is in the hospital dying from AIDS, Mimi provides simple joy by painting his fingernails blue. On another day, when he is shaking and dehydrated, she's there for him, feeding him ice chips. Wouldn't you want friends who'd do that for you? When you're at your worst and look like hell? I do.     - Unconditional love  Throughout Angel's final journey, he has the love and support of his partner, Tom (Jesse Martin), whose dreams for both of them resonates with vitality in an earlier scene on a subway train. Columbus returns to the train in \\"Without You.\\" This time, however, Tom cradles a now sick Angel in his arms. It's the scene that starts the tears flowing, unless you're a cold, heartless buzzard. The song ends with a lifeless Angel, eyes open, being embraced by a grieving Tom. The sense of love and loss is palpable.     The director captured all of that in four minutes. Way to go, Columbus and crew.    ----    Kudos to Rosario Dawson. You could see Mimi in her eyes and expressions, gestures, tears, even the way she sat--yes, sat--in her scenes. She shakes her leg with nervous energy in the support group meeting. She sits in utter dejection when an angry Roger walks away from her.    Oh, and she can dance. And sing. After you watch the \\"Without You\\" number on DVD, close your eyes and play it again. You can hear the tender emotion and hurt in her voice. Give the girl an Oscar.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|A supernatural thriller seen through a Federal Marshall's perspective, \\"Shutter Island\\" is a suspenseful edge-of-the-seat movie. A brisk pace helps heighten the tension, as U. S. Marshals Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio) and Chuck Aule (Ruffalo) are sent to Shutter Island, an Alcatraz Island for the criminally insane, to investigate the mysterious - and seemingly impossible - disappearance/escape of a beautiful female patient, Rachel Solando (Mortimer) from Ashcliffe Hospital. As the two uncover further clues and interview the physicians and staff, they quickly realize Shutter Island has skeletons in the closet, a possible background of illegal and experimental treatments on patients, and the misleading facts about the facility are hindered by hospital medical personal who are not telling the whole truth.<br /><br />Parallels can be drawn to various other suspense thrillers - most notably [[ASIN:B001BRZ5J2 The Sixth Sense]] - but they're not so obvious as to belie the paranoia or to minimize the success of the intricately twisted psychological storyline. Determining the villains and truths is the primary enjoyment while watching Scorsese's interpretation of Dennis Lehane's novel.  The plot and lack of action causes the movie to drag at times, and the ominous feeling desired by Scorsese is somewhat lacking.<br /><br />The acting, however, is top notch except for a few characters.  While DiCaprio is as intense as ever - and further displaying why he might be the best young actor of his generation - and Ruffalo is adept as his partner, the staff at Shutter Island, with the exception of Ben Kingsley as a caring, competent psychiatrist, are simply not enjoyable.  Ted Levin, someone I usually appreciate, is insignificant as the warden; John Carroll Lynch is just as bland as the Deputy Warden.  And Max von Sydow may as well have looked into the camera and whispered, \\"I'm cashing this one in.\\"  There are two bright spots, however, and they are Jackie Earle Haley as patient/prisoner George Noyce, and Elias Koteas as Laeddis.  While Koteas is scary, and his makeup job memorable, it's Haley who deserves recognition.  Just like his performance as Rorschach in [[ASIN:B001FB55H6 Watchmen]], he steals the show when he's on screen.  Seen in a dark, filthy cell, he delivers a chilling warning with the passion of someone who actually might be crazy.  Mesmerizing performance.<br /><br />There are a few minor differences from the book that can't be held against anyone involved with the movie.  Even though I really wanted a specific scene with an armed ferry to be included.  Overall, however, something else is definitely lacking.  I don't know if the hospital staff needs to be more evil, or the story needs to be more foreboding.  Either way, it didn't feel as terrifying as I expected it to be, despite the overall impressive quality of the film.  Accolades for cinematographer Robert Richardson (Inglourious Basterds, Aviator, Kill Bill 1 & 2, Casino) are deserved.  While the actors don't necessarily deliver consistently throughout the entire movie, the island itself stars in Richardson's capable hands.<br /><br />Overall, a very good movie, definitely worth seeing at the theater, but missing that je ne sais quoi.<br /><br />Jason Elinand Elias Koteas as Laeddis.

B001P3SA94|4.0|If you are a fan of old-school R&B like me, you will fall in love with this movie. If I want to I can sit down and pick its flaws. But the twang of the blues guitar, the heart wrenching vocals and the aura of that era just washes it all away.     We believe it when Jeffrey Wright makes his guitar bleed as Muddy Waters, we sway as Columbus Short croons \\"My Babe\\" as Little Walter and we feel it when Beyonce's (her best movie performance to date) voice aches as she renders \\"All I could do is cry\\" as Etta James.     Yes, the history is flaky. The editing needs some work. But when you have a tune in your ears and a song in your heart, imperfections just enhances beauty. That is where \\"Cadillac Records\\" succeeds where many others fail.
0307454541|4.0|I am not a reader of mysteries, but I will write a review on this one. I rate it four stars only because the writer could have cut 75 pages or more from this story and still had the same impact on a reader. My wife bought this book on CD and we listened to it on the way to Florida. I found it very well plotted and the characters interesting. I look forward to the last two books of the series.<br /><br />It is a wonder to me how a story this good took that long to get to the US.<br />For mystery writers, this book will not disappoint.<br /><br />Dennis
0452286751|5.0|What I love most about this book is the great plot and the very well developed characters.  I find The Fountainhead is a bit easier to read and digest when compared to Atlas Shrugged (which I also love), and in my opinion, The Fountainhead also has a lighter touch when it comes to pushing objectivism.    This book is a great story about a man against the world, a man with strength of character who believes in what he does, and does it to best of his ability no matter the obstacles put in his way.  Howard Roarke is a solitary man who who excels at architecture, despite the fact that all of peers believe that his work is rubbish.  The truth of the matter is that most of them know, but won't admit, that it's really their work that is rubbish, not Roarke's.     It is well worth the read, and a great entry point before reading Atlas Shrugged, which is much longer, and delves more into the philosophy of objectivism.
B0026P3G12|4.0|Love Susan Boyle's voice, but found it a bit of an odd combination of songs -- religious with romantic.  VERY much enjoyed her notes in the CD booklet -- also VERY happy to have the words, as unfamiliar song words were hard to decipher.
B00164KYV4|2.0|An all-star cast - Ben Affleck, Jennifer Anniston, Jennifer Connelly, Kevin Connolly, Drew Barrymore, Bradley Cooper, Ginnifer Goodwin, Scarlett Johansson, Justin Long and Kris Kristofferson  - hits the skids in  \\"He's Just Not That Into You,\\" a supposedly insightful and epic look into the complex dynamics of man/woman relationships that could single-handedly turn members of both sexes off romance forever.<br /><br />In this misguided endeavor (the only thing really clever about it is the title), it's hard to tell which gender comes off worse - the women, who are all portrayed as needy, insecure, controlling, man-hungry whiners, or the men, who are all inconsiderate, self-centered louts.  And this battle-of-the-sexes face-off goes on for a grueling two hours and nine minutes.<br /><br />The specific details of the romantic roundelay the characters put us through doesn't really bear repeating here.  Suffice it to say that the actors do what they can with the material - the movie was written by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein (based on the novel by Greg Berhrendt and Liz Tuccillo) and directed by Ken Kwapis - and that most of the characters manage to see the errors of their ways in time for the obligatory happy ending (could that possibly qualify as a plot \\"spoiler\\"?  Only if you have never seen a romantic comedy before, I suppose).  Barrymore does get off a few choice lines about how hard it is to date in a world dominated by email, cell phones, text messaging, voicemail, and a whole host of other technological gadgets that actually make communication MORE difficult rather than less so, but that's pretty much it in the laughs department.<br /><br />And a couple of other points:  why is it that, in a movie that takes place in a modern urban setting, the producers couldn`t cast even one person of color in a major role (there are plenty of them in the background appearing as waiters, however)?  And what's with all the gay guys, with their limp-wristed affectations and \\"You go, girl!\\" theatrics?  Frankly, I thought we'd gotten past all that by this point.  It isn't even a matter of being politically correct; it`s a matter of creating a credible environment for the movie to tell its story in.<br /><br />If you're interested in watching a genuinely great romantic comedy, skip \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" and check out the 1967 classic \\"Two For the Road,\\" starring Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney, and see how truly insightful and thoughtful a movie romance can be!heatrics?

B002VECM4A|4.0|One of the best movies of the year so far. Sidibe and Monique's performances are Oscar worthy. I also loved the overall treatment of the movie.     With such a complex subject it was very smart of the director (Lee Daniels) not to use a heavy hand. When I saw the trailers for the movie, I was afraid of that. I was expecting an overdose of melodrama and over-wrought background scores relegating a powerful story to Hallmark-ish crap.     But thankfully Daniels has managed to evade all those trappings. Instead of taking a shortcut and going for the visceral emotional response, Daniels has succeeded in making us really think about the character's plight and the more bigger social implications.So thank you Mr. Daniels.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|Borrowed the widescreen dvd from the local library to refresh my memory and get ready for this year's Harry Potter movie...which I pray will be much better than this mess. I hated the film when I saw it at the movie theater and hate it just as much on dvd. It left out way too much of the story and I don't know how anyone who hasn't read the book (which is FANTASTIC) could understand even a fourth of what is going on.    The last book in the series (boo hoo!) is being made into two movies and this book should have been too. The film's story jumps all around and makes little sense. The absolutely worse parts start up to, during and after Dumbledore's death. Good grief! How could they leave out Harry's immobility, Dumbledore's army and wizard friends fighting the death eaters, Bellatrix & company, funeral,especially the phoenix lament, etc., etc., etc.    It's a wonder J.K. Rowling didn't sue Warner Brothers just on principle. Here's hoping the next two movies are more faithful to her, the story and all Potter fans.

B00003CXC6|5.0|This movie needs no endorsement from me, it is a classic. But I think it should also be required viewing for high school age students as part of learning about citizenship. This movie and 12 Angry Men provide a dramatic insight into the need for skepticism and moral courage in making judgements. Each of the witnesses here testify in self-serving but mutually exclusive ways. In 12 Angry Men it is prejudice that infects the process. Both are able to get a philosophical point across while still being a tense drama. They should show both of these to anyone called for a jury pool as well.
B002VECM6S|2.0|Right from the previews it seemed like a mountain of cliches. But a best picture & best actress nomination later, I felt I had to give it a chance.     Two hours later, I have absolutely no idea why the movie got those nominations. The inspiring story of Michael Oher is the only redeeming quality. But that had nothing to do with the movie making.     The direction was abysmal with every known Lifetime device being employed to fashion some emotion in the viewer. It never succeeds. It just made more annoyed at a wonderful story being mistreated by Hollywood just like what they did with Invictus. There are several other movies deserving of that Best Picture nominations.    Sandra Bullock acting is passable although annoying at times. But it is nowhere worthy of an Oscar nomination. There are certainly other performances out there worthy of that slot - case in point Abbie Cornish in Bright Star, Samantha Morton in The Messenger, Michelle Monaghan in Trucker.    The only reasoning I can think of for these nominations is - White Guilt. Yeah, I said it. The Oscar nominations committee is most likely predominantly white. So a story of a white woman changing the life of a black kid mixed in with a good dose of Christian overtones makes the nominations committee feel better about themselves.     Nothing else.
0385523904|5.0|In this internet age, it's easy to find out about almost anything---that is, except North Korea.  Even this book admits right at the start the author was not able to first hand see the real North Korea, just the carefully screened tourist parts.  But she did the next best thing---she really got to know 6 defectors, and tells here in great detail about their lives before they defected (and a lot about after they did, also).  We get to see how until about 1990, their lives, although certainly nothing to envy, weren't horrible, and in fact North Korea did better than many communist countries in feeding their people and keeping them fairly healthy.  It was only when most other communist countries had their economies collapse that North Korea fell backwards many years, most of the country no longer had regular electricity and famine set in.  It's awful reading about a famine that happened so recently---thinking about myself living my regular life while children were starving to death.  It's an interesting perspective to me, someone who has read literally 100s of books about China, to see China as the rich neighbor, where one defector sees what looks like a hearty meal and realizes it's for a dog in China.<br /><br />I hope someday North Korea will open up, and families split apart by the totally arbitrary boarder will be together again.

B001U0HBPG|4.0|Perhaps once or twice in a year, a movie comes along which can be described as lyrical. This is definitely one for 2008. Somehow the whole feel of the movie reminded me of watching \\"The New World\\" the brilliant work from Terence Mallik. Apart from having a love story as the crux, their plotlines have nothing in common. The similarity is more to do with the narrative and the willingness look more closely at the human condition than breeze over it.     David Fincher is a master craftsman. His body of work is standing testament to his abilities. Last year's underappreciated 'Zodiac' was probably one of the best films of the year. Fincher gives a demonstration in how the narrative has to adapt to the storyline. Zodiac was edge of your seat thriller (not in the conventional sense) but here he allows us to get up close and personal with Benjamin, Daisy and Quinny.     The cast is incredible. Fincher's attention to detail is evident when he has cast a terrific Julia Ormond in a minor role. Lot many drectors may have cast a lesser actress. Cate Blanchett is someone who elevates herself in every movie I have seen. She seems to constantly strive to find that extra dimension to her characters. Her Daisy evolves beautifully throughout the film not just due to brilliant special effects but also due to the way Miss Blanchett refines it with age. Taraji P Henson agan proves she is a force to be reckoned with after \\"Hustle & flow\\".     Then of course Brad Pitt. Most of the time his acting is effortless. It almost seems as if he is playing is cool collected self. But he really blossoms as the love story between him and Daisy picks up steam. He portrays a lovely blend of tenderness with the increasing confidence of a man getting younger.     If you are someone who has found him/herself losing track of time looking at a painting or any kind of art, this movie is for you. Because real art is not something you gobble up. It is more sedate approach of savouring every morsel until its real beauty strikes you deep within. This movie is just that.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I bought mono box after researching different discussions here and everywhere (mono vs. stereo). I do not want to repeat all what has been said already, just give your few reasons why mono over the stereo. Hope that would help to make someone's mind in buying either set.<br />1) I never could listen to STEREO Beatles records, because virtually there is no such thing as STEREO recording of Beatles, as we used to, when we say STEREO recording. Everything, except for Yellow Submarine, Abbey Road and Let It Be has been mixed in mono. As for anything other Beatles album, STEREO means vocals in one channel and else (drummer, guitar, etc) in another. Do not be mislead by the word STEREO, it is not STEREO as you might think. Personally, it is very difficult to listen to such STEREO mix.<br />2) Packaging is made to its best you could imagine:<br />- Replica (AKA Mini LP) of original Beatles albums<br />- CDs are packaged in antistatic inner sleeves (looks like Nagaoka sleeves, which I use for Vinyl)<br />- Every album is packaged in outer sleeve<br />Stereo boxes are packaged in Digipacks, not so exciting.<br />3) I think ALL mono boxes are made in Japan. Stereo are made either in France or US. Try to listen to recent Japan CDs - you get an idea about their excellent quality.<br />4) They would be collectible, because of the packaging, Japan made and because they are not sold separately (not like with Stereo Albums)<br />5) Mono box has got less off noise shaping and etc than stereo mix.<br />6) Mono versions is what Beatles meant to do with their recordings. Stereo mixes were made by other stuff.<br />7) Mono might be difficult to listen in headphones (I have Sennheiser HD 800, source is Electrocompaniet EMC 1UP and amp is Elekit 882AS with WE 396A tubes - very detailed and high resolving system), but if you get used to it - it becomes enjoyable. Through loudspeakers - no problem at all. But again, listening either way STEREO would not bring them to stereo (as we used to) level. It is just 2 channel mix.<br />8) You have to get only 3 albums to complete the collection (I mentioned them in p.1). You might want to get White Album (my preference) in stereo, others mentioned Sgt.Pepper. Up to you.<br /><br />Make you choice! :)e to get only 3 albums to complete the collection (I mentioned them in p.1). You might want to get White Album (my preference) in stereo, others mentioned Sgt.Pepper. Up to you.    Make you choice! :)

0316666343|2.0|I read this book because someone dear to me wanted me to read it.  I had no intention of reading it before.  I have read a book similar to the premise of this book and I thought that book was enough.  I knew from the first chapter that I would not enjoy this book.  The victim is not a person I really liked.  She was a teenager and her friends are teenagers.  Their lifestyle is promiscuous as are most of the characters in the book.  I did not grow up in such an atmosphere, so I couldn't identify with any of them.  I didn't find the book uplifting or even exciting.  I might want to see the movie out of curiosity.
B001UV4XUG|3.0|Joseph Gordon Levitt and Zooey Deschanel elevate this movie to new heights. An interesting twist on the boy-meets girl tale. The movie tries (an often succeeds) to break the facade of lovey-dovey stories which is piled on us by Hollywood in the name of romantic comedies.     I would have given it four stars but there were instants where the movie seemed to be trying too hard. With any good art, the key is restraint. Even in a Jackson Pollack painting of splattered colors, you see the control.     I wish the director had taken a sharper scalpel to the editing process. The song sequence just distracted from the feel of the movie and seemed forced. Also the out of sequence narration has become an over used tool in the indie genre. That is why I have deducted half a star.     One thing to note is the camerawork. I can't recall a movie in which LA landscapes have been shot with such love and attention. It is only far into the movie that you realize the movie is set in LA and not in NYC/Chicago.
B0012GMUOU|1.0|As much as I disliked \\"Flash\\", this is the absolute worst.  I liked \\"Who else\\" and \\"You had it coming\\", but \\"Jeff\\" sounds like music that had been picked over from a scrap heap and put together  just to fulfill a lost bet or something.  I can't believe a talent like Beck would allow this garbage to get out to the public.  His first two albums are classics.  His work with Tench and  Middleton were good. His jazz fusion period was sensational.  Since then it's as if he's lost his direction.  His live albums are always good, but Beck, do what you do best and quit trying to  reinvent yourself.  You only put out a couple albums every ten years, so please play some rock again.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|This album was a huge suprise for me. I had only heard Day N Nite, but heard Common was backing him on this, so I decided to check the rest of this album out. This \\"Kid\\" brings alot to the table, and has a hell of a future if he can bring this kind of heat everytime out. Give this a listen for something different, meaning not every song is about bitches, guns, drugs, and cars. Thought provoking lyrics.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I have gotten everything she and the guys put out since i bought their first album in 1984, Have been waiting for the new one since 2000, this album is great. Love the guitars, love her voice, the whole band is spot on for this sound. In a sea of inane trance like sampling, hearing real melodies is just the best. There are many putting out \\"music\\" but in the long run the chaff falls to the bottom. I dont mind waiting for quality. This is a great album.
B002JCSWV6|2.0|This is a movie that could have made itself. Inspirational characters, an uplifting story and a nation united.     One would have thought a director like Clint Eastwood would have had a field day with it. Instead he plays it super-safe and draws from every known sports movie cliche out there. Would it have been to difficult to find two South African actors who can play the lead roles? This is not to say Freeman and Damon are not good in the movie. Damon in particular is wonderful.     That being said, the movie stumbles around too much to build any kind of intensity. That is a pity given the inspiration nature of the story. Too often we come across movies which fail because of a bad or non-existent story line. But this is a case where the movie failed the story.     I am sure this movie will garner some awards just like the other Oscar fodder which Clint Eastwood has been putting out in the last couple of years. It is time for him to rethink his movie making approach. Maybe he is constrained by studios or public perception. If that's the case, he should stop making movies. That last thing we want to see is Dirty Harry himself becoming the punk.
B002XMGGJM|3.0|As one reviewer shared earlier, this is a movie that can generate many a (meaningless) chatter. It then serves its purpose as light popcorn fare since it is merely meant as entertainment, not a social thesis. And on that level, it fairly succeeds and it is a waste to exhaust any mental workouts breaking down the many, MANY bad filmmaking flaws. THE END.    But, if this doesnt help the reader any on how to approach this product, then read on ....    Why does it get a giant Megan Fox thumb's up and yet its accompanied by a only three rating? This is what is referred to as a guilty pleasure. If made well, the plot, as implausible as it may be, will keep the audience intrigued, even if just to cross the I's and T's for the viewer before they walk away. For any potential snub reader, riddle me this: what draws and continues to bring audiences back to movies such as Avatar, Star Wars, Austin Powers, Pretty Woman (a HOOKER who lands a billionaire!), It's a Wonderful Life (about a prick who gets to redeem himself only after seeing his family HAPPY without him?), Field of Dreams (a second chance of warming to your parents after shunning their existence the first time around!), etc....? It's called SUSPENSION OF DISBELIEF. Now, the second element necessary to enjoy a guilty pleasure is the casting.     In order for the audience to enjoy and want to revisit pricks, hookers, idiot spies, intergalactic peacekeepers, et al. the actors must have the ability to sell the characters they are portraying, since usually the script will be inane and the writing can have you wincing. For some outrageous act of faith, Tinseltown has transformed Foxx into a bonafide star. Though not and never will be familiar with Redemption (his first Porsche), Collateral and Jarhead offered fine performances because Michael Mann and Sam Mendez are expert craftsmen who knew how to arrest his comedian/broham tendencies. If not for Butler, this movie would have been a complete disaster. And Butler will neverbe confused for a thespian in the Olivier, Welles, Day-Lewis, Hopkins mold either. (And yes, i am quite aware he was a stage actor in the UK).    Does anyone remember Stealth, The Kingdom, Miami Vice, Ray (which he portrayed on numerous occasions in his comedy skits!), The Soloist (even Downey, Jr. looked embarrassed)? This dude is not a professional actor, though does have a massive ego. (watch The Great White Hype, to enjoy Foxx on film).    I understand Hollywood will continue to search through coal mines (jewel metaphor reference), bar clubs (Vin Diesel), gimmick forums (wrestlers), etc.... for the next cash cow and if you were in charge of studio projects, you would as well. Blockbusters and guilty pleasures is what makes it possible to produce Oscar quality films, it's a fact. But, it doesnt mean as an audience, we have to always swallow what they attempt to feed us. So in this case, give it a spin and try to enjoy the movie's twists, violence, moral agitators for what it is, a Cape Fear/Death Wish knock-off with an atrociously misplaced main lead in the story.
B00009YOQW|5.0|This is a lovely little drum, as pleasing to the eye as it is to the ear. It's something your kids can bang on all day without giving you a headache, because its sounds are melodic, pretty even. We own a First Act drum that while very authentically drum-like in its sound, makes you want to clap your hands over your ears once the kids really get going on it. Not this drum. The rubber-headed mallet, when struck against the drum produces about three different lovely tones. Its appeal to the kids is equal to that of us noise-weary adults. Which is why I won't hesitate to buy one for our kids when the opportunity arises.    That's right, I don't own it. My best friend does; she bought it for her son this Christmas. I felt compelled to write a review about it because of her story of how incredibly durable this drum is, especially since she almost didn't buy this drum after reading the top-rated negative review on Amazon.    On Christmas morning, packing up to go to the grandparents house, my best friend's husband (whoops) left the drum sitting atop her car. Predictably, when she pulled onto the highway she heard it skitter across the roof, and then a chorus of angry horns blaring as it almost caused a pile-up as cars braked and swerved to avoid it. Sadly the drum not only was dropped at a high rate of speed from the roof of her car, but it was also run over - as the tire track on the underside of the drum attests. There were parts of the drum that looked like a puppy had gotten a hold of them and chewed them to bits. This should have been the end of the story for this little drum, particularly if the aforementioned design flaw was inherent to the toy. However, the drum itself endured this unusual level of abuse beautifully. It did not break, and a little sanding is all it took to return it to right, the tire track being the only real evidence of its big exciting adventure down a four-lane on Christmas Day.    A couple of months later this drum is still entertaining my best friend's son - and his playmates - like it did first thing Christmas morning. It sounds just as lovely, and it's solid as ever.    I don't doubt that there could be an occasional 'dud' or a drum that had an unusually brittle top, but this incident suggests the design is quite hardy. And the drum itself is a lovely little instrument.
014144116X|5.0|This book was for my wife for a class. It is fully footnoted and will be of great help for her in the class.
B00275EGX8|4.0|Easily one of the best films of the year. Well considering the competition was movies like Transformers 2, it isn't saying much. But this movie would have been a stand-out in any year. A movie so visceral, so raw and so involved in the psyche of a soldier in Iraq has been rare to non-existent.     For me the most poignant moment of the movie has the lead protagonist standing in the cereal isle of a super market trying to decide which one to buy. In his arena of IED disposal, his decisions changes lives. Cereal is well...cereal.
B002T9H2MO|1.0|Decided to provide my take here because like me, sometimes fresh prospects look to this section as opposed to the 5-star section which is usually chock full of fanatical ravings, to get a faint glimpse into what didnt work for some reviewers. And to each is always and shall be their own. But for those of you seriously contemplating viewing, this decision will depend on what you seek. If youre searching for sci-fi such as the classic Transformers, Surrogates, Star Trek, Avatar, this is not it. But if you happen to exist in the minority, where you can appreciate thought-inducing drama, this is ideal, if for no other reason, to enjoy a great performance.    Is it slow? Once again, depends on what youre searching for. Is it compelling? Not necessarily, but certainly an intelligent story, realized IF YOURE WILLING TO INVEST YOUR TIME AND PAY ATTENTION. The CAPS were to emphasize a relative point derived from these other 1-star reviews. Which is, either they expected Event Horizon, Mission to Mars, or Ghost from Mars, who the hell knows, or they were unable to follow the story from beginning to end, which will be required to absorb all five basic food groups to the story.     Is in mind-bending such as the first Matrix, not in the least but mature cinema aficionados or those simply in the mood hoping to not be insulted, will definitely enjoy. Unlike Bruce Dern, Sam Rockw(B)ell is the man!
B001GCUO5M|5.0|\\"Shutter Island\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Two U.S. marshals, Teddy Daniels and Chuck Aule, are summoned to a remote and barren island off the coast of Massachusetts to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a murderess from the island's fortress-like hospital for the criminally insane.    The cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio (in his fourth go-round with Scorsese) (as Teddy Daniels) is excellent!

This is an excellent mystery-thriller that's different than most mystery-thrillers out there. This is another excellent film that was adapted from a Dennis Lehane novel. This is another hit for Scorsese & DiCaprio.

It really is one of the most inspiring books I've ever read. I'm now working on training for my first ultra thanks to Mr. McDougall!     As for it's entertainment value, it is outstanding. There were points in the book that when I read them I would laugh so hard I would lose my place! It really is quite witty. Also, the author builds up to the climax so well you can't set the book down.     I would, and do, recommend this book to anyone (whether you be a runner or not).

076781214X|5.0|You are always being told, &quot;You can never go home again&quot; and other settings similar to this. Yet people always speculate what if I could go back but when I change? Would I change something? There are many speculative movies out there on this very subject. You maybe have seen a few of these movies including sci-fi movies such as &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, or comedies such as &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, or educational movies such as &quot;Bill &amp; Ted's excellent adventure.&quot;But you ain't seen nothing yet until you seen, &quot;Peggy Sue got Married&quot;.<br /><br />While in the midst of her high school reunion, Peggy Sue (Kathleen Turner) faints. At this point, she is transferred back to her high school days. She is reunited with old friends and relatives. Yes, she has a chance to do it all over. This time with the knowledge of time. When confronted with opportunities like eating M&amp;M's she realizes that you don't eat the red ones.<br /><br />Will their decisions change the future? Moreover, will she ever be able to get back with the help of a local Lodge?<br /><br />Just a side note you will enjoy the music as it is actually one of the characters of this movie.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Yes, the music is great and Madonna really puts on a show but you don't even have to be a Madonna fan to appreciate her talent if you watch this DVD; I found myself almost exhausted just from watching the amazing moves and dance choreography. Yes, I am a huge fan and may be a little biased, but I think that even a 20 year-old athlete would have a hard time keeping up with Madonna and her dance partners, so it is even more amazing that she is a woman approaching 50 (at the time of this tour).  I just saw her on her \\"Sticky and Sweet\\" tour and let me tell you, she has not lost a step.  This is a must-have for any Madonna fan.

B000YJ54DU|5.0|OK, so Lee Child isn't exactly Tolstoy or Dickens, and his hero is a misanthropic thug, but who hasn't daydreamed about being a non-person, wandering about using wits, wiles, and fists to right injustices and settle scores? And that's Jack Reacher who does not try to subvert or trick the system with false IDs and such. He takes the bus, pays cash, buys new clothing when the old stuff wears out. No family, no friends, no entanglements, no regrets - a strong, self-reliant character who floats on the surface, diving deeper only when he feels an injustice has been done. The premise is strained, no doubt, but the writing is just good enough to make it readable. I find it a guilty pleasure and enjoy watching Reacher get himself into and out of difficult circumstances, trying to make things right. So, yep, most of the one- and two-star reviewers are correct, but then they probably think James Bond is not entertaining. If you don't much care for Bond, Reacher won't please you much either, for Reacher is the crude American cousin to Bond. Who says sociopaths aren't entertaining?<br /><br />If Reacher bugs you, try Thomas Perry's Jane Whitefield series - you'll probably like her since her sociopathic behavior is rooted in her heritage so it's OK.  The irony light is on here, folks, so no outrage at my aparent insensitivity.
B000002J09|5.0|Well, I like a lot of what people have written about the Zep IV disc.  I agree with it.  But I do think, due to the limited production techniques of the time, it is dated in its sound when compared to a lot of comparable rock music released today.  Even when I listen to the LZ remasters--which I had hoped would have greatly improved the production sound--the IV disc will always be an artifact of its time.  For the commenter that was so caustic and dismissive about the disc, it's your opinion...if this guy/gal really feels that way, then that is their business.  If this person really believes that LZ IV is without merit, he should probably state from what perspective he considers the album to be such a non-starter.  I will say this, when you listen to IV (or any albums of that period) the production techniques are dated when compared with comparable heavy rock music by today's standards (such as Foo Fighters, for example).  And one might also consider that, although most of what Zep was doing at the time was novel and nobody had *ever* heard anything like it before, by today's musical standards, a lot of what's on the album is \\"old hat\\".  There are better guitarists than Page playing today, there are better vocalists than Plant, etc.  But that shouldn't detract from what it is that they accomplished AT THAT TIME.  And it should be noted that most music is derivative anyway--think evolution by natural descent--everybody who is anybody in pop/rock music today will likely have been influenced by this and other Zep albums, simply because the songcraft is impeccible and it *does* stand the test of time, regardless of whether the production values on the disc are dated.  This is clearly a generational thing, seems to me.  I grew up listening to this, and was learning to play the songs on it in '74 when I was in high school.  To me, Page was a guitar god, and still is--although I follow some of the younger guitar players who are equally as innovative (check out the DVD \\"ItMight Get Loud\\" for a view of how 3 different generations of rock guitarists view this phenomenon).  I suspect others feel that way about White Stripes or Good Charlotte or any other more modern act.  Putting the shoe on the other foot, there are artists I hear today for whom I have equal disdain (Lady GaGa comes to mind, given that she is, IMHO, a shameless derivative of the Madonna of 25 years ago, and I really didn't like Madonna then either); and I think that many of these artists are nowhere *close* to the likes of Page, Plant and co. or other \\"classic rock\\" artists of that era.  To each, his own. It does take an open mind.  So, it's no reason to be ugly about it! Regardless of whether this particular reviewer was being imflammatory simply for \\"kicks\\" or whether it's a genuine opinion.  As my grandmother used to tell me, \\"opinions are like @ssh0les, everybody's got one\\".  Cheers. jd
B0030BOCEG|5.0|Awesome album! Love it to the core!!! To all those who hate it or judge it to the \\"bad\\" extreme, get over yourselves and grow up. Oh, it's not like their old stuff, blah, blah, blah! Who wants the same stuff over and over. I'll tell you who ... those who never change, those who never grow up, those who eat macaroni and cheese every day of their lives. This album is awesome! I love the fact that they took a chance and made an \\"American\\" album. Hell, I was around when the Rolling Stones did a disco album and it shook me to the core but guess what people, they're still here! Ville doesn't need his Goth makeup and outfits anymore, he's outgrown them and all the poor little whining kids too. This is a great album if you're mature enough to really listen. If not, don't go to any more of their concerts, that'll make more room for real music lovers and real HIM fans like me who can appreciate change and going with the flow. I'll be at The House of Blues show on March 28th! Yeah!

In their hands, it is overlaid with a loud, cheap, obscene hip hop beat that defiles the song (everything after 30 seconds in).

I am trying to listen only in half hour segments in order to stretch the listening as long as possible.  There are times I laugh out loud and times that I tear up.  We watched the original series on television and have the video collection as well.  I never, never tire of this series nor the wonderful characters and animals.  This reading is absolutley brilliant as I said above and Mr. Timothy transports the listener to the dales of Yorkshire.  I cannot think of enough superlatives to recommend this to lovers of All Creatures Great and Small.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|\\"Shutter Island,\\" based off of the book by Dennis Lehane, is a frighteningly great film that continues the artistically lucratively partnership between Martin Scorsese and his star of choice Leonardo DiCaprio.<br /><br />DiCaprio plays a US Federal Marshal in the early 1950's who heads with his new partner, played by Mark Ruffalo, to Shutter Island, an island off the coast of Massachusetts that houses a hospital for the criminally insane. One of the patients, a woman accused of drowning her three children, has gone missing, and DiCaprio and Ruffalo are sent to investigate. The investigation quickly leads the two lawmen to believe that there is more going on at the hospital than meets the eye. Ben Kingsley and Max von Sydow, who run the hospital, seem less than cooperative, and it becomes apparent than DiCaprio has ulterior motives for investigating the goings on at the hospital.<br /><br />Part gothic love story, part psychological story, part horror story, and altogether shocking, this movie weaves a complex, paranoid story into a stunningly surprising story that entertains, scares, and in the end, leaves you satisfied by the plot twists and turns. All of the performances are solid, particularly DiCaprio, who reminds any viewer of the film that he is one of the cinema's best actors.<br /><br />Shutter Island takes us to a place that no one would choose to go. When it's over, the viewer is very glad to leave, but appreciative of what they have experienced along the way.
0399230033|5.0|My son just loves this book -- it has been his favorite ever since he was about a year old.  He is now about 2 1/2 and still wants me to read it to him.  He loves to tell me what's going to happen next and says things like...\\"Oh, no...the gorilla took the keys!\\"  or \\"Oh, no...the gorilla let the lion out!\\"  I have recommended this book to many friends and have given as a gift.  There isn't a lot of text, but the graphics are great -- like I said, my son just loves this book.
0143034901|5.0|It has been years since I have so loved a story as I have Zafon's \\"Shadow of the Wind\\".Five stars also for the outstanding translation by Lucia Graves. In a few months time I am going to read it again. I want to walk in the gas-lit streets of Barcelona and revisit the well-crafted characters who lived there. I have to smile when I think of the lovable, humorous Fermin. Lacrymose over the fate of Nuria Monfort. Shudder at the thought of ill-using, bloody Fumero. These are just a few of the fine gallery of \\"dramatis personae\\" caught up in this complex, haunting, never to be forgotten story. It is reminiscent of the brooding, gothic city stories of Lovecraft, the darkly mysterious tale of Diane Setterfield. Then Zafon polishes off the story with truly satisfying denouement clearly beyond the ordinary. Upon closing the book, I let out a long sigh and thought \\"well done\\".<br /><br />High recommendation. Don't deny yourself the pleasure of this story. Seriously.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is the best show that there is! The struggle between doing what's right and what's wrong. Then realizing that what's right or wrong really all depends on the way you look at it.  John Teller's manifesto may be one of the main characters as it sways jax's perspective. It doesn't always give him answers but it always gives him a look at what he's going through, through a different set of eyes. The show has it all! I especially like the somewhat dark comedy put in to break up the \\"tough\\" image of the show. I guess i like this show so much because i can see myself being one of the characters. Great Job Kurt Sutter!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|Excellent show, its like gorwn-up nancy drew! its very interesting, not too serious, funny and they solve the case each time.. except beckett's mom's case.. this is classic tv. almost circa 1960's. :)
B000093FLA|5.0|I seen this movie a lot of years ago. Everytime I passed it in the movie rental store I would smile and remember the talent of Brad Pitt. He is as believable in this role as he was in 12 Monkeys. The music is a major part of this movie as is the haywire plot.<br />This film is still being shown on HBO and reveals a side of the British that is funny, serious and strange.<br />Great to have in your DVD vault.
B00319ECGU|5.0|I just got this last week on the 16th with the preorder delivery.  It is a nice assortment and is for people who don't watch all the extras that are packed into a disc, like me.  The disc quality is excellent and is the same ones that come in the larger pack.  It is simple, the movies look great, but if you want extra features get the ultimate collection and if you're interested in the movie only get this version.
1593080255|4.0|I have heard a lot about this book and, having read a few of Oscar Wilde's plays and enjoyed them, decided to give it a try.  Overall is was a good book, if a bit inconsistent in pacing at times.<br /><br />Dorian Grey is a beautiful young man, who is corrupted by a Lord to worry about how his looks might one day fade.  While a portrait of him is being painted he wishes to never grow old.  Later he realizes that the portrait is changing to reflect any cruelty in his nature, yet he remains the same.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde is a genius at writing.  The cleverness of the language he uses and the sharpness of the commentary on society is deftly done and makes the story a joy to read, most of the time.  The footnotes in this version of the book help to explain some of the more subtle jokes that I would have missed without them.<br /><br />The book does have some flaws, especially when compared to modern literature.  Wilde takes nearly half to book to set up his characters.  You can tell Wilde is a playwright at heart because many of the characters wander off into multiple page long dialogues that get to be a bit too much and sometimes a bit boring.  Even in the second half of the book there are times where Dorian is reading from the book he is obsessed with and it just goes on and on and on.<br /><br />The second half of the book is by far the strongest.  Wilde stimulates the imagination by talking about Dorian's unspeakable acts but never revealing what the majority of the horrible acts are.  I was a little disappointed that there isn't a lot more to the plot than what you read on the back of the book.  That being said, the end of the book is remarkable and really made the book a wonder to me.<br /><br />Overall this is a very interesting book and worth the read.  Some of the lengthy dialogues can get a bit trying to read through, but most of the book has a quick wit to it that is amusing.  The ending of the book holds some wonderful surprises.  I would recommend reading this, especially if you are a fan of Wilde's writing style.Wilde's writing style.
B002ZG4QB6|5.0|Any one who likes early British and US Rock 'N' Roll will really enjoy this DVD.  The Shadows are one of the best all time selling instrumental rock groups ranking right up there with The Ventures of the US, Japan and other International fame.  The Shadows got their start by backing the vocalist Cliff Richard, the group Cliff Richard and The Shadows had several hits in the UK and Europe predating the Beatles and Rolling Stones.  Their music is excellent and the video and audio on this DVD is also superb.  These guys got their influence from Elvis, Buddy Holly, and Duane Eddy and developed a style of their own.  This DVD is well worth the price and is excellent.
0446613444|4.0|Just recently started reading Connelly and the Bosch series. The Black Echo seemed to start out slow for me and gradually became quite a thrill ride to the very end. The Black Ice, however, grabs you from the beginning and does not let go. There is rich character development, including Det Bosch and others in the LAPD, a solid if not spectacular plot and unexpected developments throughout. This is one of those books that defines \\"page turner,\\" as you get hooked and stay hooked.<br /><br />Not too long ago I read a review that suggested The Black Ice was somewhat flat compared to books #1 (The Black Echo) and #3 (The Concrete Blonde) in the series. From my perspective, the ride started gradually out of the gate with The Black Echo and has steadily, and at times quickly, gathered a full head of steam. I'm jumping right into the Concrete Blonde because I can't wait to see where Connelly takes Bosch in the subsequent books.
1591391105|4.0|I'm never buy nothing before at Amazon, then I buy one book used and liked very much. The book was perfect, as like new!
0812971825|2.0|Strout captures the essence of small-town New England in Abide with Me, but that is about all. This book was darker than \\"Amy and Isabelle\\" and \\"Olive Kitteridge\\" and does not hold up well in comparison, in my opinion. Just too sad and melancholy and fairly boring, to be honest. And too many characters that I just did not care about.
0143034901|4.0|One Line Summary: Boy learns to change his life by finding someone else's.<br /><br />Daniel is ten when his father takes him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, where someone once, a long time ago, started piling thousands of forgotten books in a crypt. He is to tell no one about it and he can take one book with him to keep safe forever. Daniel takes The Shadow of the Wind by Juli&aacute;n Carax. He loves it so much that he wants to find all the books written by this man...but he soon learns that someone has been systematically buying and then destroying all of this man's books, a mysterious man who is burned beyond recognition and calls himself the devil.<br /><br />We follow Daniel and his cohorts over the years as he tries to find out the mystery of Carax and his books.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this novel. It takes place right after Spain's Civil War in about 1945 in Barcelona. It was a treat to follow Daniel in his journey of life; how his life in many ways compared with Carax's and how he was able to learn from his mistakes in order to make his life a better one. Zaf&oacute;n draws us in with his descriptions of Barcelona and Spain's Civil War. I loved how he drew us into all of the characters and made us care about them. No one was perfect. They mystery was also very intriguing. I had guessed a few things and was right about some and not others.<br /><br />Quote: \\"Every book, every volume you see here, has a soul. The soul of the person who read it and lived it and dreamed with it.\\" I think that's true. Which is one of the reasons I have a hard time giving up my books even if I didn't like them that much. After I've read one it becomes a part of me somehow for good or for bad.<br /><br />This book also reminded me of when I first read Jane Eyre and the impact that had on me. It was the first time I had ever actually loved a book.<br /><br />These are just a few of the many gems in this book!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I was extremely fortunate to be able to get in on the Gold Box deal a few months ago for this set. This is, hands down, my greatest (and even with the deal, most expensive) music purchase ever.     Before I purchased this set, I would say I enjoyed the Beatles, but I never considered myself a superfan. That has changed. I now know why this band is considered by so many to be the greatest of all time. I have spent pretty much the last three months listening to the Beatles' music day and night, and, I have to tell you, it is astonishing what they accomplished in the span of about seven years.     The Beatles invented or co-invented so many genres of rock music that are popular today or enjoyed popularity previously: Heavy Metal (Helter Skelter, the single version of Revolution No. 1), Progressive Rock/Concept Albums (Sgt. Pepper), Psychedelic Rock (multiple tracks from the Revolver era on), heck, one could even argue they helped to pioneer rap and the sampling craze (Revolution No. 9). They mastered instruments years before other bands even knew what they were, such as the Moog (featured on multiple tracks on Abbey Road), distortion bass (Mean Mr. Mustard), the sitar (multiple tracks). I think they even invented a new sound with the \\"distortion brass\\" featured on Good Morning from Sgt. Pepper.     The arrangements on the Beatles' songs are nothing short of astonishing. They are so complex, and yet so brilliant. Every time you listen to a song, you hear something new, because there's just so much to take in.     The CDs sound absolutely astonishing. Yes, the stereo separation is a little \\"hard\\" in the early albums, but they still sound fantastic. Abbey Road, which was originally recorded in stereo, sounds absolutely stellar.     Every album the Beatles put out, with the possible exception of Yellow Submarine, is a masterpiece. Whether it's the boy band pop of their early days or the more revolutionary music of their later years, you are pretty much listening to the best music of each genre. My favorite among the favorites is Abbey Road. What an astonishing album this was, and it let the Beatles exit out on top. Every song on this album (or in the case of the medley, song part) is incredible, even the SEVERELY underrated Maxwell's Silver Hammer (if you don't like it, listen to it again). Revolver is another album full of masterpieces, highlighted by John's fantastic And Your Bird Can Sing, Paul's Eleanor Rigby, and George's Taxman (Ringo would have to wait until Abbey Road to write his masterpiece, the fantastic Octopus's Garden). Sgt. Pepper and The White Album are also terrific.     The Beatles do have a couple of duds in the catalog (Wild Honey Pie comes to mind), but there are so many incredible songs you won't even care. (ABBA has the distinction of being the only band I can think of that never released a bad song. But, of course, their output wasn't as massive as the Beatles' either.)     So, if you're on the fence about getting this set, trust me, DO IT. You will not be sorry. If you can't afford the whole set, try to pick up the four albums I mentioned above (especially Abbey Road) to start yourself on the path to Beatlemania.
0061703257|3.0|This book has a lot of twists and turns and until the very end I should've clued in but I didn't. Some smarter people will probably get it before it's over, but I enjoyed the psychological ride. But this book is not for the faint of heart. It has language galore, such as the F-bomb and their are some pretty graphic visualizations of crimes, sex, etc. But if you can enjoy a story for its story then check this one out. I won't be seeing the movie since I know that it will contain some pretty graphic violence and language and reading it in a book is one thing, but seeing it on a big screen is quite another! So enjoy!
B00005JLKB|4.0|it was a good buy, everything worked, and was clean, the reason this did not receive 5 stars is because when i received it, the discs were loose, and were not securely in the box set. This could have been caused from shipping. But just in case, i gave it 4 stars.
0545123267|3.0|I went back and forth on this one throughout...two stars...2 and a half...then back to two. I thought it was all right, overall I enjoyed it, but it wasn't my favorite. It took awhile to get to the plot. It started off with Grace and Sam just mooning over each other without a lot of action. The series is about werewolves...so give me some action, a plot.<br /><br />The action never got too exciting, though, which was really disappointing. Just when you thought it was going to get good, it ended way too fast; it was very anti-climatic.<br /><br />Grace and Sam seemed a bit too obsessed with each other...but compared to Twilight they were pretty normal! So there were a few cheesy lines to each other, but the author did manage to create a feeling of coldness throughout the book so that's pretty impressive.<br /><br />Also Grace didn't go catatonic after she thought she lost Sam...she still had a life with school and friends, etc...unlike another certain character I know...<br /><br />But it felt like another Twilight knockoff and why do YA novels have to get rid of the parents? They are either dead, took off, or just uninvolved and/or clueless. Well, Grace's padres are both uninvolved and clueless and Sam's tried to kill him....<br /><br />But it was relatively clean and pretty well-written and the ending makes me want to pick up the next in the series.<br /><br />A note about the audio book version: I thought it was done pretty well, the actors were great, but the voice for Sam was too old. He sounded in his mid to late thirties when Sam is supposed to be a teenager so that was a bit annoying...just a heads up!
0132350882|4.0|I am a huge fan of \\"Uncle Bob\\". 15+ years ago I was reading his papers and learning a TON from them (back then, he was \\"Robert C. Martin\\"). Those papers were what he dubs \\"SOLID\\" today.<br /><br />This book taught me some great stuff. One of the best gems is the idea that a function should describe the 3 or 4 steps that are one level of abstraction down from the function's name. Very cool.<br /><br />However, the book could have been much better. About half of the chapters were merely statements of obvious moral advice. Like, \\"get plenty of exercise\\" and \\"wipe well after using the toilet.\\" The other half were very good because they managed to walk you through some *experience* with some code that *showed* you why you should follow the moral advice.<br /><br />Plus, the \\"Systems\\" chapter was merely a very shallow whirlwind introduction to AOP and a few other concepts. Seriously? To do anything with those concepts, you need a lot more meat than that chapter could possibly give you. So it makes no sense for the chapter to be in the book at all. And the \\"Emergence\\" chapter was a big disappointment. I was so excited when I saw the chapter title, because there was potential there for them to do something really special. They could have walked through an example of some code where a design emerged. Uncle Bob states several times in the book that the code does not come out \\"clean\\" the first time he types it ... you get it working, but then you don't stop there. Going through an example of that would have been perfect for the \\"Emergence\\" chapter. Instead, they just said things like, \\"Design emerges.\\" Again, shallow moral advice that mostly states the obvious with no additional insight offered.<br /><br />But don't forget ... I'm talking about HALF of the chapters. The other half were excellent. A lot of wisdom distilled into a few pages. Overall, I give the book 4 stars and recommend it.
0439023491|4.0|What makes a great book? When you are yelling at the characters while reading! Yes, I did this. Katniss and the rest of the districts are slowly rebelling against the evil Capitol...President Snow retaliates by sending all the previous victors of the Hunger Games into the arena to fight it out. Can Katniss save Peeta or herself and thus her family?<br /><br />This is an excellent series and I can't wait for the third book! Katniss is an unassuming hero and that's why I love her. She knows what's good and right and she doesn't even realize it. We also have another love triangle with Katniss and her two guys Gale and Peeta. We love them both! Well, I do anyway.<br /><br />The world of the Hunger Games is just scary. Could our society ever become as debase and freedomless as this one?<br /><br />This series is definitely one I'll repeat again and again!
1594488878|4.0|Juliet, Naked, is a witty and surprisingly deep novel about three characters who take tentative steps toward fulfillment after wasting sizable chunks of their lives.  Duncan and Annie, a forty-something couple, are nearing the end of a long, loveless relationship.  Duncan is the head of an obsessive internet fan club whose greatest passion is an endless loop of speculation about the lyrics and whereabouts of reclusive rock musician, Tucker Crowe.  Annie is a museum curator in a nothing town who has settled for dull Duncan and his mind-numbing lifestyle.  Tucker Crowe, the third part of this quirky triangle is a rocker who briefly found fame after a single successful album in the 1980's.  He retired shortly after its release.  Now in his mid-fifties, Tucker is broke and dependent on affluent ex-girlfriends for room and board.  The man has gone through a string of failed relationships and has four children he hardly knows.  Only his precocious six-year-old son Jackson lives with him.  The two share a close bond.     A fight between Duncan and Annie over the quality of a new Tucker Crowe CD triggers a series of events in which each character finds a way out of his or her rut.  Duncan leaves Annie for another woman.  Annie stumbles into an email correspondence with Tucker Crowe and becomes infatuated with him.  Tucker finds himself just as smitten and arranges to meet her in London.  He soon escapes with her to her sleepy English town so that he might avoid a reunion with his estranged extended family.  When the time comes for Tucker to go back and face the music, he and Annie are reluctant to write off their relationship as yet another dead end.    This novel is not without its flaws.  None of the protagonists are likeable, and I have difficulty understanding what Annie and Tucker see in each other.  Young Jackson is too smart and well-spoken for a six year old.  Finally, the story itself feels plodding at times.  Still, it's an easy read and has a much better ending than the straight-forward, happily-ever-after I was expecting.  Annie makes a remarkably interesting decision near the end of the book.    Juliet, Naked, is right up their with Nick Hornby's High Fidelity and About a Boy.     Joe
0060935464|5.0|This story is a classic because it continues to resonate with its readers/watchers no matter what decade or century one lives in.<br /><br />I first read Harper Lee's novel in my ninth grade English class. It had a profound effect upon me. Growing up in Utah where everyone was pretty White I hadn't really thought about racism, I mean, I knew it existed, but I'd never been exposed to it either personally or in literature. So when I read this novel it allowed me to enter that world where it exists (I know it exists everywhere), but where it actually brought me into a world that dealt with it culturally as part of daily life. I remember while reading how appalled I was at the ignorance and hatefulness of these characters. I remember feeling akin to Scout and her brother and friend during their summer excursions and wondering who Boo was. I remember feeling injustice and sorrow and a desire to do my part to make the world better.<br /><br />So once again I feel a classic is a story that gets me thinking about the world, my own prejudices and how I am pulled out of my comfort zone. To Kill a Mockingbird is just such a story. It is beautifully told through the eyes of a small girl and allowed me to see the events in a different view.<br /><br />I was very surprised that this movie came out in 1962 since the Civil Rights Movement was still in its infancy. All of the actors did a superb job, especially Gregory Peck as Atticus and Robert Duvall as Boo Radley. The book is usually better, but I still felt the impact of the story in movie form. Thus, both have impacted me and continue to do so each and every time I read/watch this beautiful and poignant story.
B002XMGGJM|3.0|Every one is tainted, except the kids. A give no quarter attitude is the ideal. No gray allowed. Enjoyable, but a comic book feel to complicated issues.
0385341008|5.0|Thoughts: First thought....it was beautiful, fun, romantic, sad, hopeful, and captivating. This is my second epistolary novel and I love them. The authors weaved a beautiful story all from letters. Letters convey such a different emotion...it feels so personal, like these people actually exist and we're sneaking in on their personal lives by reading their letters. It was like coming across some old letters of my grandmother's in the upstairs attic (don't have an attic, but you get the point!).<br /><br />We learn all about Guernsey island during the German occupation of World War II. I'm sure I learned at some point that some part of England was occupied, but if I did it never stuck...I had no idea that these islands had been taken by Germany. It was a new experience for me to learn how some of our allies fared during the War. What makes it even more poignant is we learn about these experiences from people that we come to love and care about in the novel. So when they laugh, we laugh; when they cry, we cry.<br /><br />If you haven't read this one, do! Pick it up! You won't be sorry!
B0030BOCEG|5.0|While this is not as dark as some of the previous albums, it is definitely not a go happy, rainbows and butterflies album either. It is still very much a love metal album but rather than saying love=death it is more like being in love and suffering, having fears and a ton of other emotions only Ville Valo can describe! Lyrically, it's amazing: in my opinion Valo is a great, like Poe meets Dylan! The fact they write their own music, keeps the album cohesive and authentic. [[ASIN:B0030BOCEG Screamworks: Love in Theory & Practice (Limited Edition 2XCD)]] has a new direction though, musically it has an 80's vibe with upbeat metal rhythms to contrast the dark lyrics. It will make you want to get up, dance, sing and yet you will want to cry. It is an album that uses components from many of the bands I grew up listening to (ie. Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Neil Young...) and still is able to add in something very unique and fresh. I have had the CD for two weeks now and have not been able to listen to anything but it! I am sure you will feel the same way.     My top five favorites off this album are: Scared to Death, Acoustic Funeral (Love in Limbo),Ode to Solitude, The Foreboding Sense Of Impending Happiness, and In Venere Veritas. Honestly they are all great. I know there are albums where its like you only like a few song on the album but this is definitely not the case. I have been following HIM for about 6 years now and am willing to admit [[ASIN:B0030BOCKK Screamworks: Love in Theory & Practice]] is by far my favorite album overall by this band.
0375842209|5.0|This story drew me in from page one. Markus Zusak has a wonderful way with words.<br /><br />  \\"I walked in, loosened his soul, and carried it gently away.\\" \\"Somewhere, far down, there was an itch in his heart, but he made a point not to scratch it. He was a afraid of what might come leaking out.\\" \\"Burning words were torn from their sentences.\\"<br /><br />These are just a few sentences that convey his beautiful imagery in this book. This is a very different perspective on Germany during World War II and the Holocaust. It was great to see the side of Germans that were against Hitler and wanted to protect those that needed it. I felt that Zusak captured Germany during that time; what it was like to be a non-Jewish German, a young adult, poor, watching your world fall apart around you, seeing the cruelty of war and intolerance, and yet trying to make sense of it all. This is a story that needs to be told and it is beautiful, heart-wrenching, sad, and yet hopeful.
0316044695|5.0|Occasionally I read a book that I feel must be shared.  Such a book is \\"Lone Survivor\\" by Marcus Luttrell.  It is the true story of four US Navy Seals who were deployed to capture and kill a notorious al Qaeda leader located in the rugged mountainous region of northeast Afghanistan, and ultimately find themselves caught up in a ferocious firefight against an army of hundreds of Taliban soldiers.  Not only does the book excellently portray the US Navy Seals' codes of honor, courage, sacrifice, and relentless pursuit of the enemy, it also tells of the ancient tribal code of honor of the rugged tribal Afghan Pashtuns, who, at great risk, provided refuge for the battle's lone survivor, Petty Officer Luttrell.  Yet, this book is more than just about the battle and the ultimate sacrifices made by the Navy Seals, it is the first person account of becoming a Navy Seal as experienced by the author, Marcus Luttrell. You will definitely find this book well worth the time and effort taken to read its 444 pages.
0439023483|4.0|Katniss is one of those beautiful characters that doesn't realize how great they are! She lives in a brutal post-apocalyptic world where the government uses brutal hunger games to keep the population in line. It reminds me a lot of the Running Man type reality.

B000026156|5.0|The following is for people who like CONFERENCE OF THE BIRDS, and want more of the same type of music.  FIVE PIECES 1975, with Anthony Braxton, Dave Holland, Barry Altschul, and Kenny Wheeler(trumpet), might be exactly what you are looking for.  Despite the fact that FIVE PIECES 1975 was recorded a year or so after CONFERENCE OF THE BIRDS, I found FIVE PIECES 1975 to be more palatable and easier on the ears.  The fact that FIVE PIECES 1975 has never been issued in compact disc format, could be characterized as a tragedy.  Truly, FIVE PIECES 1975 needs an advocate who is committed to getting this disc properly issued.      Let me make this analogy.  Most of Antonio Vivaldi's compositions were thought to be irrevocably lost until Alfredo Casella, during the 1930s and 1940s, discovered Vivaldi's sheet music.  Alfredo Casella ensured that these compositions would not be lost to humanity.  Thus, in my opinion, we need somebody like Alfredo Casella to bring FIVE PIECES 1975 back into the public's eye.  To repeat, FIVE PIECES 1975 has the same style as CONFERENCE OF THE BIRDS.  The music on FIVE PIECES 1975 are likely to be even more attractive and interesting than that on CONFERENCE OF THE BIRDS.      CUT ONE of FIVE PIECES 1975. This piece is, You Stepped Out of a Dream. Sax plus bass only for one minute, playing this jazz standard. At one minute, both sax and bass start improvising. There is never any trumpet or drums in this piece. The sax plays bebop style throughout. At 3 min, 50 sec, there is a lengthy bass solo. At 5 min, 40 sec, the sax returns. At 6 min, 20 sec, the original tune returns. The piece is never frantic, fast, or \\"out there.\\" CUT ONE is 7 min, 10 sec in all.     CUT TWO. Flute, drums, and bass start this piece. The tune is slow, jagged, and spacey. (It could be something expected from the first album by Return to Forever.) At 2 min, Barry Altschul does a solo on his big collection of cymbals, gongs, and flexitone. At 3 min, 50 sec, the flute and bassreturn. The trumpet materializes at 4 min, 20 sec, but the piece ends only ten seconds later. CUT TWO belongs to Barry Altschul.     CUT THREE. This is the great stand-out of the album. The sax, trumpet, and drums play a pre-determined, jagged bebop tune. Throughout the entire piece, Dave Holland plays hand-plucked thumps, sounding like pig farts. There is no walking bass at all in CUT TWO. At 3 min, 20 sec, the sax lets out some honks, at 3 min, 50 sec, the sax lets out some squeaks. The trumpet starts at 4 min, and here we hear only the trumpet plus bass and drums. At 5 min, 30 sec, the sax returns, and at this point there starts a relatively brief meandering episode, which includes some stupid-sounding smacking noises. At 6 min, 45 sec, the original tune resumes and the piece ends at 8 min.     CUT FOUR. This is the blowing session of the album. The sax and trumpet start out, with slow, long-held notes. At 50 sec, the bass starts up, and it is bowed with long bowing notes, and there are sizzling cymbals. At 2 min, there is a ten second drum solo, and at 2 min, 20 sec, the sax and trumpet return--and the drums become more prominent, more clicking, more insistent, more varied. At 3 min, 20 sec, the bass starts to get very rapidly bowed (no more long, drawn-out bowings). The sax and trumpet continue with their original slow duet of pre-determined notes. At 4 min, 50 sec, Dave Holland gets a little wild and his bowing gets frantic. At 5 min, 15 sec, the excitement starts. Both sax and trumpet play sphagetti music--honks, bleats, free jazz. Dave's fingers are all over the fretboard. At 6 min, 30 sec, the trumpet drops out, and the sax plays more tangled sphagetti music. The trumpet enters at 7 min, 30 sec, and the sax drops out. It is a muted trumpet, and here, things get slower and quieter. The sax joins in cautiously at 8 min, 30 sec, and the mute is taken off of the trumpet at nine minutes. The flute joins in some ten seconds later, and here, there is just trumpetplus flute (no drums or bass). At ten and a half minutes, we hear a bass saxophone, sounding like a strange, grunting animal or perhaps a locomotive engine. At 11 min, 30 sec, only flute and bass play, and then only flute. At 12 min, 30 sec, there are weird high-pitched squeaks. By this point, most people would have put an end to CUT FOUR. At 14 min, 30 seconds, the flute plays some skittering sounds. At 15 min, 50 sec, there is a tiny drum solo. At 16 min, the original tune resumes, giving us hope that CUT FOUR will be ending soon. But unfortunately, CUT FOUR continues on for seventeen minutes and 20 seconds.     CUT FIVE. This cut is a bit like CUT THREE. The bass plays a 2-note motif. Sax plus trumpet join in, and play bebop. Eventually, at 1 min, 15 sec, the theme tune makes its first appearance (while the bass still plays the 2-note motif). At 1 min, 50 sec, the bass breaks away from the 2-note motif, and begins a walking bass. At 2 min, 30 sec, the 2-note motif returns, and the sax and trumpet both improvise. At 3 minutes, a fadeout begins and CUT FIVE ends at 3 min, 20 seconds.
1400082773|4.0|I never knew that President Barack Obama was a writer before he entered the political world. So I decided to pick this one up last year and read more about my new Commander-in-Chief, the first African-American President of the United States! I'm so glad I did. He has a beautiful way with words. He came from so many different worlds and he tried to understand them all...his white mother and Kenyan father. He lived in Indonesia for a few years as well. He tried to understand who he was and where he came from. He only met his father once...<br /><br />He eventually went to Chicago to be a political organizer, to help get things turned around in neighborhoods that didn't have too much. And he eventually makes it to his father's native land of Kenya where he meets all of his family. Where he learns that \\"if everyone's your family then no one is.\\"<br /><br />This book was so insightful not only on race and life, but on the man himself, how he thinks and feels about the stuff of life. He's a down-to-earth guy who's trying to make life better for those around him. And in the end I like who he is what he thinks.<br /><br />Some wonderful quotes: \\"That's what the leadership was teaching me, day by day: that the self-interest I was supposed to be looking for extended well beyond the immediacy of issues, that beneath the small talk and sketchy biographies and received opinions, people carried with them some central explanation of themselves. Stories full of terror and wonder, studded with events that still haunted or inspired them. Sacred stories. \\"<br /><br />\\"It was as if he had come to mistrust words somehow. Words, and the sentiments words carried.\\"
0316017922|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Gladwell's thoughts and hypotheses as to what makes for success. He gives us plenty of food for thought as he delves into the opportunities and circumstances that differentiate the extraordinarily successful from the more average achievers, and I found his case studies to be fascinating reading. A very provocative book and an enjoyable read!
0385732554|2.0|I really wanted to like this one too...I enjoy the dystopia type society and what could be world. I was into this about the first 50 pages or so and then the rest of the book just left me feeling bleh. It's been done before and better with A Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451. (with the first two, so I've been told, but with Fahrenheit definitely.)<br /><br />I got the feeling throughout the last half of the book that she was telling me what was good and what was bad and how I should feel. Like with The Adoration of Jenna Fox I want these types of books to lay out the questions and themes without answering them for me.<br /><br />I can see why people enjoy this book; it's horrific and kind of thrusts the creepiness and icky factor upon you with a sense of relief that you're sure glad your life isn't like this...but it just answered for me instead letting me answer for myself. I guess it's an OK read if you don't try to take too many things from it, but I know Lowry was trying to teach here and thus my displeasure.
0312370849|5.0|All the members of the Brown Baggers Book Club in Warren MI. loved Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay.  It was well written, Kept you totally involved and could have been a real happening.       It was a great book to discuss as there were so many themes and our older members could remember and relate to those times.      Made you really think of life and all the many things we do not want to  remember.      This a Book I wanted to keep and share and I'm glad I bought it at   Amazon. com                     Joan G
0547258305|5.0|What a refreshing book! This is one of the best new fantasy concepts I've read in awhile! The concept of Graceling is kind of like mutants but set back in time to a different land. If you are graced then your eyes will change to different colors at a certain age and it's up in the air what \\"grace\\" you'll be blessed/cursed with!<br /><br />The main character is Katsa and her grace is killing. How is she able to be a compassionate and loving person even when her grace is the art of killing? I just loved her and admired her throughout the whole book. She learns so much about who she is and how to control her grace for the help of others. She was strong and yet had so many flaws. I think more books need some strong female characters, especially for youth and this one hits the mark.
0312370849|5.0|excellent story- keeps your attention until the end.Goes back and forth between ww11 and the present.Realistic story. I really enjoyed it.
0689865384|3.0|I love post-apocalyptic reads...this one didn't disappoint. The only thing that bothered me was the main character Tally...she had too much of a 360 change from being the brainwashed ugly to the better informed one, but oh well, I'm still excited to finish the series!<br /><br />I really enjoyed how three hundred years into the future things haven't changed that much. Everyone still cares about looking perfect and not being happy for who they are on the inside and not what they look like on the outside. I think it's a great story on learning to break out of society's ideas of beauty and to find one's own beauty and for that I really enjoyed this novel.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|Great to have the entire box set without doubt, but I find that (at least in the first season), there are multiple situations where the discs skip. This happens on multiple consoles.
0316044938|3.0|This was a beautifully written novel. The perspective was amazing from the ghost of the girl who dies in the first page of the book how she looks down up all those she loves and those she wanted to, and the one who murdered her. Questions I thought of while reading were, How do the dead perceive us? Do they watch us and hear what good and bad things we have to say about them? I like to think if I ever have someone I'm close to die, that I could talk to her and tell her my thoughts and feelings. I do feel we're connected to those who've passed on and this story just brings that to life.<br /><br />Disclaimers: There were a few scenes in here with a murder and some sex...they don't last long an I think there were a couple of f bombs, but overall the book was pretty clean.
B002DKGWSE|5.0|I realize a lot of people prefer the original version, but I've never seen that one so I can only comment on the updated remake.      The Last House on the Left is *awesome*.  I can't remember the last time I seen such a disturbingly violent film.  This is *definitely* a movie I recommend to anyone who loves the Hills Have Eyes.  Yup, the two films share many of the same disturbing characteristics.    Incredibly bloody, violent, and shocking killing scenes.  That's what the Last House on the Left is all about.      The storyline is not one I want to share, because I don't wanna spoil it.  Let's just say, what are the odds of THAT?  You'll know what I mean about halfway through the film.    These are the shocking kind of horror films Hollywood needs to be concentrating on these days.  Ones that really deliver with the violence, and don't let up the entire time.  I went into the film hoping for a few killing scenes, instead I get the greatest movie since the Hills Have Eyes remake.      I will say this though- this movie is NOT recommended for children because of some exceptionally disturbing scenes involving sexual content.  The writers didn't hold anything back in that regard, so I recommend this film only for people 21 years of age or older.
0316044695|5.0|Thank you Marcus for sharing your herioc story. Your story has gaven me a whole new perspective on what you really go through. The little things that we take for granted. God bless you and your brave friends who gave their lives for us. You have my undying gratitude! You and your brothers are always in my prayers. I thank God every day that there are brave men like you willing to put their lives on the line to protect us and our great country. I've harped to my Congressmen for years that the service men and women are vastly underpaid and underappreciated. I wish your book was mandatory reading for all politicians.<br /><br />God bless you!<br /><br />Jeanne
0743289692|5.0|This is the best book I have read in years. As I progressed in reading it I could feel more and more empathy with the author, and could not resist creating many earmarks, something that I usually try to avoid.<br /><br />Having said this, I think there is one aspect that could have been investigated better: the similarities between Islam and Christianity. What Ayaan saw was a sharp contrast because she went from a strictly Muslim family, living in a Country that was several centuries behind the west, to the 21st century in Holland. But if we look back at 100 years ago or more it wouldn't be hard to find that some of the bad things about the way women are treated by Islam  today have ancient roots even in the Christian religion.
0316017922|4.0|Gladwell explores the external factors involved in whether a person becomes successful. His very act of writing about these external factors in a society that likes to believe that everyone is on a level playing field makes this book an outlier in and of itself. It's definitely worth reading, as it makes you really think. Whether you end up agreeing with him or not, his ideas are still worth examining.
B003629IPW|5.0|These DVDs are very well done & I somehow wish they could go ahead and have the concert even though MJ has died, because everyone else is *so* good.<br /><br />This seems to have been edited from the version that was shown in theaters.  There were a number of instances of MJ speaking where in the theater version he sounded positively weird.  The friend I went with and I both came out saying we thought he looked mildly handicapped, because of the odd way he spoke and moved.<br /><br />In this version, all those sequences have been removed and what is left all looks very slick and normal.<br /><br />Still, it's a great concert, even in rehearsals.<br /><br />And it was great to meet the singers & dancers & see the elaborabe costumes and aerialists who were planned.<br /><br />This DVD comes with its own strange software to play it on the computer.  There is a weird control panel that appears on the screen and you have to figure out which icon to click on to get the thing to play.  It's a little one just to the left of the circular thing, BTW.<br /><br />Now I just wish I had waited for the 3D version, which I assume will be coming out soon.
B00003CXAW|5.0|This film has been with me since childhood. I marveled at its grandiosity and its drama for years and still do. No one makes great, imaginative films like this anymore. This two disc special edition is a superb piece of art to add to any film collectors collection. The movie is in pristine condition, beautiful to watch and the extra features on Merian Cooper and the story of King Kong are magnificent. Watching this film again, I am truly in awe at how techically amazing it is and innovationg. The story is endearing and the dialogue filled with masterfully dusguised and hilarious inuendo. Merian C. Cooper and Co. did a heck of a job. Truly a treat not to be missed. I highly enjoy the contents of both discs.
0316069906|5.0|Eating Animals explores the impact of factory farming.  Grounded in research, investigation, testimonials, and interviews, Foer makes a strong case for his decision to refrain from consuming animals.  He addresses factory farming from an ethical and ecological perspective, acknowledging that there are other factors to consider, which are not covered in the book, such as workers' rights and public and personal health concerns. He also addresses the issue from a philosophical and psychological perspective by considering what moves people to act and what keeps people from changing, despite the implications our choices have. Beyond the facts is his personal narrative: his choice to refrain from consuming meat. Interweaving stories from his family adds a unique dimension and helps to explain his own obstacles with breaking from tradition in order to live within his values. I thought this was a good read because it was informative and insightful.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|The other reviews give a good balanced picture of this turntable and the software, so I just wanted to add as an update that I had no problems using them with Windows 7 (64-bit). When I installed the software, it said there was an updated version so I clicked to let it go find it. Careful: when it finds the update package, you have to close the software before running the update.    The one problem I had with the turntable assembly instructions was that the illustration and explanation for attaching the belt were unclear.     The sound quality of the turntable when hooked to my stereo receiver is excellent. The sound quality of the recordings on my computer is very good.
B0030BYWKK|5.0|This is a great album start to finish, for all those who say that its too similar to their other releases, I disagree and even if you believe that does it really matter? Ive been listening to it while Im walking at night and its perfect. I make my walks last longer just so I can listen to it longer. I will say it doesn't have the great stand alone tracks like kingfish pies or roscoe but I don't mind. Its a good album all the way through and that is very hard to find. I'm seeing them in April and I cant wait to hear these tracks live.
B002YIHO7I|2.0|Lord knows I love me some Sade but this offering is pretty sad. We waited all the years for this monotone effort. Sade and Prince are the two artist I admire the most but this piece of work does not deserve a place in her collection. I did my part and purchased your CD. It's time for you to do your part and bring back that classic sound I have been longing for. I still love her and will buy her next CD but to say I am disappointed is putting it mild.

B000007NZ5|4.0|Alright lets be realistic. The greatest sabbath albums are the Ozzy Osbourne era albums which include some of the greatest foundation stones of all heavy metal period.  That said this album is really very good  and I highly recommend . It certainly isnt  as good as Dio era albums or Born again  either but it has great guitar riffs , rocking rhythms ,Iommis wrenching solos and well crafted and melodic song writing and actually lyrically it is very strong it is just that although Martin is a fine singer he is not well suited to Sabbath.  This album seems to me to have been created with eye to commercial objectives and influenced by the very lucrative late 80's MTV hair metal era . This is not a bad thing at all however this is not hardcore classic sabbath. But listened to with an open mind free of 70's and early 80s era expectations this is definitely an album any mid 80's heavy rock / melodic metal fan would enjoy repeatedly
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Like most people I have seen this film on more than one occasion before buying this.  Having recently bought a Blu Ray player I wanted to watch the film again.  Totally breath taking.  One of the very few films that have given me the blu ray wow factor... 1 of very few. Total perfection.
B001FB5634|4.0|I am going to start out by saying, I liked this movie. The acting was very good. Of course it is a very sad and depressing story. Could it ever really come to this? I think I'm gonna start stock piling canned goods too.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This DVD is simple collection of a witty TV show that I hope stays around for awhile!  The show is short but well worth the purchase if you enjoy the show.
B00005NTJM|5.0|A highly layered, complex and diverse album that has stood the test of time remarkably well.      Make no mistake, this is not the Jethro Tull of later incarnations that most people are familiar with.  There are only hints here of the subsequent progressive rock followed in turn by an English minstrel folk-rock direction that Ian Anderson would later take them.  \\"This Was\\" is alternately a jazz album (\\"Cat's Squirrel\\", \\"Serenade to a Cuckoo,\\" and \\"One for John Gee\\" - an addition to the CD), a straight southern rural blues album (\\"Someday the Sun Won't Shine for You\\"), a jazz/rock fusion album (\\"Dharma for One\\"), a Chicago blues album (\\"It's Breakin' Me Up\\"), and a jazz/blues fusion album (\\"My Sunday Feeling\\").  The more melodic (and familiar) English folk rock band that Tull would eventually morph into once Anderson's stamp and leadership had firmly been established is really in evidence here most on \\"Christmas Song,\\"  and \\"A Song for Jeffrey.\\"    Musically this was almost an all-star band of British blues of the era, and perhaps as gifted in terms of sheer musical chops as Tull would ever attain.  And like others, this line-up of Tull would not last.  Clive Bunker was one of the two or three greatest rock drummers of the era.  He lays down so much sound here that one has to pay close attention just to keep up.  Mick Abrahams was a highly gifted blues guitarist.   Like many of his peers, Mick seemed to see the blues as a \\"pure\\" art form; not to be corrupted by rock or folk influences.  He butted heads with Anderson on the direction Tull should take. Abrahams departure for Blodwyn Pig and the subsequent progressive movement of succeeding Jethro Tull albums toward English folk-rock provide whatever answers we need of who won that argument.      I do not mean that as a criticism.  The band could not have survived long with such creative tension between its principals.  But  we are the beneficiaries of this, Jethro Tull's first album, and the only one with this line-up.Appreciative and attentive (need I say sophisticated) listeners will note and marvel at the diversity of musical styles evident on \\"This Was\\".   And they pull each of these styles off with equal aplomb and apparent affection.  But that very diversity may turn off a lot of music fans who may not enjoy the full range of musical idioms that Tull was expressing here.  Groups like The Mothers of Invention and The Dixie Dreggs also were comprised of tremendous musicians who could express a diversity of musical styles on the same record - and do justice to each.  But, in spite of their immense musical talent, these groups would only get so big.  Like these groups, the early version of Tull developed mostly a devoted cult following pretty much made up of young and knowledgeable music fans.      Album by album (Stand Up, Benefit, Aqualung, Thick as a Brick, Passion Play), Anderson progressively took Jethro Tull ever more toward the folk/rock sound that would eventually become their signature.       Each of these mentioned albums is worth its price five times over.  There's hardly a throw away song in the lot.  Yet few Tull songs are familiar with many people under 35 years old.  They're too gifted, too unique and too fun for that to stay the case.      Those who take the time to sit down and delve into each of these albums will find the time well rewarded.  I personally would recommend buying and listening to them chronologically - which means starting here - as there is a discernible and interesting musical progression.  But you can't really do it wrong.
0307271862|3.0|My only previous Henning Mankell book is The Man Who Smiled, which I would easily rank above The Man from Beijing. The Man from Beijing has a lot more detail. The plot is far more complex than in Smiled. But Beijing simply has too much detail and the story lines are just too complicated. And there's much that seems extraneous, particularly the concluding bit that takes place in London's Chinatown.     However, those who can accept a spectacular series of coincidences might enjoy this book. Also, readers might enjoy this novel if they can maintain their focus as the story shifts between diverse locales and time frames. Large segments are devoted to 1860's China and Nevada, as well as present-day Sweden, Beijing, Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and London.    There are fascinating treatments of the suffering endured by peasants in China in the mid nineteenth century, and the kidnapping and virtual enslavement of Chinese men who were forced across the Pacific to work on western railroads in the U.S. during the 1860's. There's also a very insightful look at the modern struggle between the Chinese Communist Party and Chinese businessmen who want to move China further toward a wide-open capitalist economy than it already is today. One wonders what would happen if the far-fetched scheme involving China and Africa that Mankell suggests in the novel actually played out.    The central figure is Brigitta Roslin, a Swedish district judge. She has ties to a remote Swedish hamlet where, one January night in 2006, eighteen elderly residents and a young boy were brutally murdered. On her own, Roslin investigates this massacre. She is shrewd and resourceful. She interacts with the local Swedish police, who, for the most part, do not take her seriously. Mankell brilliantly develops Roslin's character. And I'll never forget the particularly diabolical manner in which a particularly diabolical man plots to murder her. How does all of this lead far across space and time? You'll have to crack thebook to find out.    I had no trouble finishing this book. Much of it was mesmerizing. But there was a significant amount of fluff and confusion. All in all, I would say it's a case of more is less.
B002N8A14M|5.0|I had looked and looked for an Ipod Nano 5g case with a belt clip, and they are very rare. I finally found this one, and am very happy with it. Not only does it protect my Ipod, but I can coil up the earbud cord, and store it under the belt clip when I'm not using the Ipod.
B001G7SS9G|5.0|There is a saying that\\" No Man is An Island\\" In the case of Will Smith acting in this movie whoever said this was pretty much channeling that idea to the writers of this great film. Will Smith turned in one of the best actors of his generation with this part. True the Infected could have been do better but Smiths acting stands heads above what the so called critics had to say about this.With Manhattan as the self imposed prison that Neville has made for himself after the sealing off of the island and the death of his family trying to flee the spread of the plague that has destroyed the World it become the what I have said at the beginning. AS Neville has become an island onto himself trying to right an imaged wrong that he himself never brought.This film should be a lesson in the fact that while we may lose all we hold dear we can never let the loss detroy us and we we must find purpose. Even in our own prisons.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I am a late adopter for sure.  This is my first Nora Jones CD.  I had not really heard her much before but read a review of her latest (4th?) CD.  That review got me to try earliest CD.  It is quite good, especially as daily listening/background music. I will probably get a couple more of her CDs.  It would be nice to hear her do some of Frank Sinatra's saloon songs or Ray Charles' \\"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\\" collection.
0790740443|3.0|When I saw this film in a theater I was shocked to hear such negative reviews about it.I feel this is one of Kurt Russell best films. To all those who want a high brow movie to watch and how are high brows themselves. Please don't watch. To all the rest of us who like something in the vein of Blade Runner and who judge films we are not afraid to say we like..This is the one.
B002XMGGK6|3.0|Law Abiding Citizen is a pretty good action movie. Clyde Shelton watched as his family was killed in a home invasion.  DA Nick Rice makes a deal with one of the killers and he gets only a few years in prison while the other guy gets the death sentance.  Rice is repulsed by the deal he made, but he wants to keep his high conviction rate.    Ten years later, the guy on death row is somehow given the wrong chemical and dies horribly in front of Rice and others there to watch his execution.  Then the other guy is found dismembered.  Everything points to Shelton.  He is arrested.  But the killings continue, as more of the people involved in the case die.  Rice races to figure out how Shelton is committing the crimes while locked up.  Who is helping him?  I'm fan of action movies and have been for years.  They don't really surprise me much anymore.  But there is one moment in this one that shocked the hell out of me!  It is one of the death scenes and it comes out of nowhere.  But the last third of the movie is so absolutely absurd that it kind of took away from the rest of the movie.  I don't care how rich you are, there is no way anyone could have set up the things that Shelton did.  It would be impossible.  The acting is pretty good.  Gerard Butler does a good job, and is plainly enjoying the over the top role of Shelton.  Jamie Foxx is good as Rice, but he seemed pretty wooden, like he was doing the movie for the paycheck.  The rest of the cast does well with their roles.   Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but the ending was just way to unbelievable.
0060989157|5.0|This was an awesome read!  The book follows each of the band members and their individual stories and then connects them all together as a band.  The combination of personal stories and demons in conjunction with all of the fame and money they obtained led to an amazing story.  I would suggest this book to any Motley Crue fan!

The thing was riddled with mistakes all over regarding spelling and puncuation.  COME ON how hard can it be to trnasfer a digitial copy to a digital copy?!!  Don't you kindle people review your product before selling it??  But worse is the publisher.  If I was Boyd I'd be livid.

1416583408|5.0|First, I love dogs. The two dogs I have had in my life have provided a continual source of joy. Second, I am very interested in the cognitive sciences, understanding how the brain works. Therefore, when my kids saw this book they knew it would be a perfect Christmas gift for their dad.     Although there is a lot of good science in this book, this is no sterile, soulless examination of animal psychology. Alexandra Horowitz does an excellent job of combining both the science around dogs along with the love of dogs. Her love of dogs really comes through, so that immediately makes me a fan.     While the book provides some very practical advice on how to get the most out of your relationship with your dog, there is also a good deal of information on how a dog's brain works. As you read this book, you can see how to develop a richer, more rewarding experience of having a dog.   There are also important points that can be applied to more than just dogs. For example, the book presents the concept of a umwelt (OOM-velt). The concept is to capture what life is like from the perspective of the animal. This is not just good advice when discussing the relationship one has with their dog, but with anyone.     If you have a dog, are interested in dogs, or are interested in how brains work, pick up this book. It is a good read.
B00005KHJV|5.0|This rare out of print DVD of the classic film 'Halloween' contains footage shot by original director John Carpenter and added to the film when it made it's network TV debut. After all the gore was edited out, Carpenter and co. had to fill up the time needed to air a film during prime time hours. And so missing chapters, like glimpses of Michael Myers in the asylum as a boy, were finally revealed to fans. As a 'purist', i do own a copy of the film in it's original theatric cut, but the 'fan' in me considers this a must have companion to the original cut. You won't be dissapointed!

B000002I55|5.0|Well...not hardly. And it is usually understated. Before this album, critics were applying the term 'free jazz' to Coleman's music. And of course, big-shot Columbia recording artist, Miles Davis had the 'foresight' to declare that Ornette was 'all mixed up in the head.' I must admit, Miles did some good work, but it ends for me just about where this album began, that is, 1960. And usually when another musician goes so far as to make it personal, they do indeed feel threatened. Of course, what Ornette did with this album, and was approaching prior to this album, was a music totally distinct from bebop. And sure enough, Miles made some steps towards that himself. But, what was to come (didn't Coleman have an album with that in the name?) was the Free Jazz movement. And realizing that the collective improvisation as assembled by Coltrane was to come five years after the release of this really puts things into perspective. I mean, Coltrane did a whole bunch to promote the free jazz movement (actually, I like the term Avant-Garde better), because Coltrane had some commercial success and let's face it, before he had reached his creative stride, he produce albums that appeased the establishment. So it may be said that Coltrane did more than anybody to open recording and other such opportunities for avant-garde musicians, but Coleman was a visionary and not to be exceeded, also not to be really understood as a visionary even by the ones who would later learn from his example for quite a while. And in the sixties, five years was a long time in jazz. Anthony Braxton, who is way out there now, was a young man learning alto at the time and recalls in an interview in the eighties how a man told him of Ornette music \\"this is jazz' and Braxton took some time to even admit it was music. Anyway the music is really playful, and the only reason I'd say I prefer the first track is it is more extended. Dolphy is wonderful on Bass Clarinet. And you've really got a double quartet here. Eric and Ornette on reeds, Hubbard and Cherry on trumpet, two drummers and two bassists. By the way, does anyone remember the oddity of two drum-sets playing on a 1969 album called Bitches Brew? Anyway, enough cracks about Miles who with the title of an album demanded: 'Call Me Sir!.' Don't ignore this album though there are things in Ascension and especially in New York Eye And Ear Control that I prefer to this album, but vice versa. Also at least check out some clips of Coleman's prior recordings and his stuff he has done more recently and all along (he has far from faded away!). I especially love Tomorrow is the Question and The Complete Science Fiction Sessions. Also I am here to download Sound Grammar for which he recently won a pulitzer. And can you believe he spent most of his career playing a plastic alto? Now he's apparently picked up Violin and Trumpet, two very hard instruments, all the more hard considering he could have just worked some more reeds into his repertoire already playing one. The man is amazing! Although I am afraid I must tell you he has sold out. He has consented to use a metal sax.

B0030GJ50C|3.0|DISTRICT 9 -- I rented this knowing it was a sci-fi movie but was pleasantly surprised to realize it was a comedy.  In fact, I found it so entertaining thinking it was one of the best spoofs I've ever seen.  It had every element of really cheesy alien movies I could imagine.  I loved the special effects because it epitomized the silly way most alien movies depict aliens.  The actors truly seemed to be having a great time.  After watching the movie, I went to read other reviews... and.... to my shock and surprise -- it was NOT INTENDED to be a comedy! It wasn't supposed to be a parody or a spoof!  Color me dumbfounded!

0061922315|5.0|Having opted to receive this book from the Amazon Vine program, I knew I was going to read about a young girl given up for adoption from the Indian slums of Mumbai and adopted by a family of doctors in the US.  What I had not bargained for was the excellence of story telling I was going to find within.<br /><br />Anyone who is adopted should read this book. It does not matter where you are from. I think it captures the heartbreak and constant wondering of the mother than gave you up. For the most part, you were not given up because you were not wanted. You were given up selflessly; so you could have a better life.<br /><br />Kavita and Jasu, were a rural couple that wanted a family. As some families do in India; when affording a family is an issue Jasu wanted a son.  Unfortunately Kavita bore him first one daughter and then another.  To avoid the second daughter meeting the same dark fate as the first; Kavita spirits her off to a city orphanage recommended to her by her sister, who had done the same.  It is heartrending for Kavita to give up this child.<br />Next you meet; Somer and Krishnan; an America couple that finds they are unable to bear children.  Krishnan's family in India is aware of this issue and let them know of an orphanage in India where they can adopt a child to take back to America.  This is easier because Krishnan is Indian. And thus the story begins.<br /><br />You find out about the hardships in Kavita and Jasu's life.  The sheer poverty, the difficult choices. You feel the pain and suffering of Somer when she realizes that all those years going to medical school and putting off having children may well have cost her the only natural child she could have.  You see also the divide between her and Krishnan this  issue is causing. Also their different ethnicities (Somer is American, Krishnan is Indian) provides some friction as Somer has really never come to grip with the Indian side of her husband and now soon, their adopted daughter will open that door even further. It is an interesting exploration of what is different in households in India versus here in the US.<br /><br />The story is wonderfully told weaving back and forth between these two couples on a timeline. Their shared daughter Asha (Usha) is the one person that links them. Though she was given up by one and taken in by another she is very much a part of both.<br /><br />Wonderful book and lyrically told.interesting exploration of what is different in households in India versus here in the US.

0805091742|5.0|The basic issue is complexity. Today's doctors are forced to deal with highly complex issues, required to read and keep up extensively on new advances and have a very narrow timeline to make decisions. Wrong decisions are costly: Someone dies.<br /><br />The author takes the time to research other areas, to see how these things are dealt with and he looks into the  Construction business, Aviation, NASA and even Finance, and finds one tool used in all: the checklist.<br />In the construction industry, a checklist helps break the complexity down as well as pass off some of the decisions, in Aviation and NASA checklists allow not only for quick responses, but they simplify the complex machinery being used. Even in the Finance industry, using a checklist helps filter out emotional decisions and allow significant gains.<br /><br />In doing the research the author relates how medicine has many steps that must be done correctly and especially timely. On top of that people need to communicate and work as a team. The current medical model is such that the surgeon; is the equivalent of the master builder and in today's world, the level of complexity makes that a dangerous model to follow. There is too much he does not know. There are too many decisions.  The surgeon needs to communicate with the team and rely on their expertise and the best way to facilitate that is a checklist.<br /><br />Working with the WHO, the author uses some tips from experts in the Aviation industry and comes up with a checklist for surgery and works with several hospitals to streamline this concept. He has them test this idea tod see if there are true gains to be made.  There are several fits and starts but when the edited checklist is used; the results are astounding.<br /><br />Phenomenal book and stunning points:<br />1. That often the most elegant solutions are the simplest and<br />2. That something as simple as a checklist may well save your life someday.
B002VKE1K2|5.0|Fortunately I'm one of those folks that turn a deaf ear when anything is hyped to the highest degree. Has anyone ever had their breath taken away from a movie? In any case I just watched this movie not knowing what to expect and I had no prejudice to contend with. The film begins abruptly like a shaky home video and it effectively establishes the characters environment and surrounding which is an over populated suburban neghborhood in San Diego ,pretty pedestrian stuff. This is where the screenwriter/director really demonstrates genius, this very innocous and plane jane home becomes a threatening and menacing place as the film progresses. All the chills and scare with the exception of a couple of the scenes are all in your imagination. This approach is used to great effect in this film and scared the daylights out of me. The film resonates with the viewer well after the film concludes. Watch this film at home alone in the dark and then see if this film effective or not. The screenwriter/director succeed in making the ordinary terrifying.The last scene is one of the creepiest I've seen since The Exorcist.Does this film have its foibles, yes but realize that the film was made for $15,000 in ten days! Hollywood is littered with innefective expensive horror films (The Haunting remake comes to mind) This film is not for the ADD/texting generation or the people who get a kick out of graphic diembowelments or torture.This is torture of the mind in the Hitchcockian tradition.
0307271862|4.0|I discovered Henning Mankell a few years ago and have been a big fan of Scandinavian crime novels ever since, even though I don't really read any other kind of mystery. His Kurt Wallander books are my absolute favorites. So naturally, I jumped when I saw this book available through the Vine program.     \\"The Man from Beijing\\" hopscotches from Sweden to China to America to Africa, with an ambitiously plotted story triggered by a mass murder in a small village in Sweden; every resident, all but one of whom is elderly, is brutally butchered. Because judge Birgitta Roslin learns one of the couples had been her mother's foster parents, she travels to the village to see what she can discover. Naturally, the police aren't interested in the rather farfetched lead she turns up because they've already pinned the crime on someone who's confessed.     From there, the storyline travels back in time to 19th century China and then America, where a character works on the railroad under inhumane conditions, then back to modern-day China, where Birgitta travels with a friend, then to Africa and back to Europe. Despite all the travel, temporal and geographic, it's easy enough to follow, and it's a fast-paced read, with sufficient suspense and adequate development of the usual flawed characters we've come to expect from Mankell. In particular, the section set in modern China is taut and compelling. But there are some fairly implausible coincidences and connections, and Mankell has loaded the book down with some rather preachy, pedantic passages about history, economics, etc. that go on too long and as a result, seem more like digressions than necessary background information to advance the plot. By the time I was about 150 pages from the end, I was antsy for the book to end, peeking ahead because the destination had become more interesting than the journey.    If you like Kurt Wallander, you'll probably like this. Just don't expect it to be, well, Wallander. Four stars because it's Mankell (who's always a real pro), it's interesting, and it's well-written. One star deducted for the somewhat self-indulgent history lessons and the leaps of faith required for some of the plotting.

B0036B8MXC|5.0|\\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" continues cable television's dominance in quality programming outshining all network shows by a landslide. The series debut on Starz TV in January, 2010 and before the series was even broadcast the station ordered two full seasons worth of episodes which shows Starz's dedication to broadcasting high quality progamming. \\"Sparatacus: Blood and Sand\\" is a historical weekly drama, made along the same lines as \\"Rome\\" and \\"The Tudors\\", but with more graphic violence, sex, and language. The series is about a Roman gladiator named Spartacus who is captured and becomes a slave in a gladiator school headed by Batiatus in Capua. There, Spartacus must fight for his freedom, and he ultimately becomes the head of all slaves as others look up to him for his determination and willpower. The first season features 13 episodes all produced where money was no option. The sets, costumes, and location shooting are the best for any series produced for TV and there were times that I had to remind myself that I was not watching a movie, but a mere TV show. Andy Whitfield, an Australian actor, is mesmerizing as Spartacus, and his character is at times often bold, intense, heart-warming, and unapologetic. Lucy Lawless has a supporting role as the wife of Batiatus who is having an affair with sexy gladiator Crixus, played to perfection by Manu Bennett. The one asset the series has is the amount of male flesh that viewers can witness week after week. Obviously great care went into the casting of actors that were buffed and well-built and if your a straight woman or a gay guy you will not be disappointed in the amount of male testosterone that is shown. Full male frontal nudity, mainly by Manu Bennett, is shown as well, which is why the series has a TV-MA rating. A wonderful series, made in the manner of a weekly serial, with excellent writing and acting is what makes \\"Spartacus\\" a soon to be Emmy winning show.<br /> This 4 disc set arrives in stores September 21, 2010 and comes with a slew of bonuses including the featurettes \\"Gladiator Camp\\", \\"History Rewritten\\", \\"The Hole\\", \\"Make-Up Effects\\", and more; audio commentaries, episodes with enhanced digital effects, trailers, bloopers, and behind-the-scenes footage. For the blu-ray release only there will be four episodes selected that will be extended cuts including scenes that were too graphic to be shown on cable television.d comes with a slew of bonuses including the featurettes \\"Gladiator Camp\\", \\"History Rewritten\\", \\"The Hole\\", \\"Make-Up Effects\\", and more; audio commentaries, episodes with enhanced digital effects, trailers, bloopers, and behind-the-scenes footage.

B00005R62K|5.0|By 1978, Priest had continued to evolve throughout their first 3 albums. This, their fourth sees the band fully embracing their identity as a metal band. Cutting out the fat from their sound (the more experimental sections depending upon taste were masterful or just boring). This is probably where most modern metalheads will want to start, as it would be the most acceptable fully realized album of the famous Priest sound. The thrash opener Exciter (one of the few tracks from this era still done live) is everything you love about bands like Slayer and Megadeth years before they did it. The entire speed genre owes its existance to Priest who although never considered a speed metal band, they without a doubt created it, mainly so with the riffs of Tipton and Downing, but new drummer Les Binks was the most technically accomplished they had worked with and his double bass skills are impressive.     White Heat Red Hot is a great often underlooked song as is the menacing title track. This album is filled with some of the best unplayed Priest songs that radio and the best ofs miss on. Saint's Hell (which featuers a great drumbreak and while Les Binks isnt doing anything spectacular, it still mananges to draw you in), Savage, and Heroes End are packed with one brutal riff and Halford vocal scream after another. He really hits some of his career watermark notes on this album. The track Invader features some great effects that start the song off, so good it's worth mentioning along with the song itself which is another highlight. There isn't a bad song to be found here, every note and every drum hit performed on this historical plate of heavy music is flawless. Of course the song not mentioned yet, Beyond The Realms Of Death is the other more well known song here (though not quite in with Another Thing Comin' or Deliverin' The Goods), it is another epic ballad that evolves into a jaw dropping classic.     This of course is the album that also features the bands cover of SpookyTooth's Better By You, Better Than Me, a pretty good cover although it does dip it slight \\"basic-rock\\" territory, that would also foreshadow the bands more simplistic arena rock sound on future efforts. This song supposedly contained a subliminal message that read \\"Do It\\" which was involved in some kids who were drinking one of which shot the other which brought the group to a 4 week trial. This is just stirred up controversey and really doesnt play into how this milestone metal album plays on you as a fan. Stained Class closed the first chapter of the bands legacy, as it's follow up Killing Machine aka Hell Bent For Leather contained shorter songs with a mass audiance appeal to them, although Priest were never sell outs, one cant criticise for the direction taken. Whether you love one side of the band or everything they did, this album should be no exception to the collection. Stained Class also help solidify the NWOBHM subgenre that crept up in England, where every kid with long hair began forming their own band, and the likes of many other British hard rocking legends that never quite made it but nonetheless lent a hand in the genres history (Venom, Tygers Of Pan Tang, Jaguar, Raven, Saxon, Savage, Angel Witch, Girlschool, Fist, Tank, Blitzkreig) existed soley after this album, it really predicated metal as a serious contender for the next musical phenomenon. Without doubt it ranks as one of the most important heavy rock albums ever created.
0451209338|4.0|Daniel Silva takes us all on an interesting ride with THE KILL ARTIST his first novel that shows us the inner wheels and workings, not to mention the politics of the Mossad and its 'Office' spinmaster, Ari Shamron. Conversely, it also shows us the inner workings of the opposition. In this instance, it's Tariq- a ruthless and gifted terrorist who wants to bring problems to the Middle East Peace process. Shamron's problem solving answer, of course, is the actual artist (art restorer actually) Gabriel Allon who is the kill artist.<br />  It's a good thriller and offers some insight to issues beyond the headlines. It also demonstrates the staggering personal cost and toll of entering into such a profession and life.<br />  Silva does a good and credible job. Not a bad book and not a bad series.
0375842209|5.0|Usually, when I know how a book is going to end the emotional impact becomes dulled because I could prepare myself for the outcome.  This is not the case in THE BOOK THIEF.  Zusak's tone packs such an emotional punch even when he prepares you for what is going to happen.  There aren't many stories that could do that.      This book should be required reading for 8th or 9th grade-which doesn't mean this book is written for young adults.  The themes and history Zusak tackles in this book are very literary and relevant.  The story here opens doors for many teaching points, which is why I don't know if teenagers could appreciate this book without a teacher's guidance.      In many ways, THE BOOK THIEF follows along the line of To Kill a Mockingbird in terms of literary power and thematic situations.  The Book Thief though, is much darker and morbid than To Kill a Mockingbird.      You will find that this book has some great characters, complete with depth and complexity.  They all come alive, especially Rudy, Hans, Rosa, Liesel, and of course Death himself.    I strongly recommend this book.
B00316DDWW|5.0|I already reviewed the Australian import version of this album so I'll just copy and paste it.<br /><br />\\"Since this album released months ago it's been receiving constant rotation in my stereo. Each song on Sound Awake is a masterpiece, and the final two tracks which make up a good 24 minutes of the album just seemingly fly by.<br /><br />With the music industry the way it is today it's not very often that an artist releases an album that is this polished and has serious classic appeal, however, I believe Karnivool has accomplished that with Sound Awake and is one of those albums that I will be listening to for years to come. If you liked Themata you need to get this album... just allow yourself some time to let it grow on you because it is a very different record from their last release. Highly recommended and so far the greatest release of the year from any band I've heard (and I like all kinds of music).\\"<br /><br />I'd also like to mention that this music trumps anything being released by American artists these days.  Australia's music scene reminds me of the American music scene in the '90s before it got corporate and out of control.  Buy this album and see these guys live while they're here to show your support.

B0028DRGDQ|4.0|My review is for the Spanish language version of the film only and not the terrible English dub. The English dub is by very bland unemotional dubbing actors and ruins the effect of the film.     My review is short and sweet because you shouldn't know anything about it before going into this baby.    Here is the review of the Spanish language version of this film.    REC is very scary, and it will make you jump out of your seat. - thats all.     I dare you to watch it sober, alone, late at night and in a old dark house.  In any case watching it in a very dark room with a good surround system will heighten the experience.    I was not to crazy about the way REC ends but it is daring and is probably the correct ending for this type of film.      REC deserves 5 stars for suspense and jump out of your seat scares - since that is probably all that the film makers intended then they delivered the goods. I decided to give it one star less only because I can't recommend REC to anyone but horror fans.     I would not reconmend the English language version to anyone even including horror fans - the folks on Amazon that gave REC a bad review probably didn't like subtitles.  Dont be put off by sub-titles otherwise stay away.    My thanks to everyone involved in the film - director, crew and cast - good job! I have not seen a good scarey film in a long time.  I was beginning to think that there were no flim makers left who could do it.

B002IYEQR4|3.0|Geez, it looks like in April we will be getting the official \\"Watchmen: The 'This is really the final cut, I'm serious guys' Cut\\". Or so I thought. I am a huge fan of the Watchmen universe- I read the graphic novel twice, I saw the movie on opening night at the theatre, I bought the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray when it got released. Then I went and bought this when it got released. Greed getting the best of me, I think so.<br /><br />I was pretty damn amazed when I saw it in the theater. Then when I got it on Blu-Ray, I felt like I had seen a totally different movie (in a good way) with it being the director's cut- It had better pacing, an extra 23 minutes to tie the loose ends, and in the end it was a satisfaction. And then I got this.<br /><br />For one, the packaging is nice and lovely to hold and look at, and to disassemble it is exciting too, just like when the director's cut of Sin City got released back in 2005, which came with the graphic novel, which was a nice little classy touch. However, in terms of content, this is nothing new. It is essentially the director's cut with \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\" shoved in there.<br /><br />The problem with it is that it's just unnecessary. TOTBF does nothing but just extends its length, and not in a good way. The movie was already long enough with the 3 hour 6 minute Director's cut. The runtime of the Ultimate Cut is 212 minutes, almost an hour longer than the theatre cut. And the TOTBF just creates an awkward transition from the movie scenes to the animated scenes. Every time the TOTBF scenes come in, they take you out of the movie, thus makeing it hard to enjoy.<br /><br />Another problem is that the TOTBF scenes ruin any ambiguity there is to Veidt's plan. It basically tells whoever hasn't seen the movie and is watching it for the first time that Veidt's plan is doomed to fail- that he will murder 15 million people and try to cover it up by making Dr. Manhattan look responsible. It also tries to spoonfeed the \\"good versus evil\\" cliche to kids under 12 watching the movie. Rorschach good! Veidt bad! The comic let you decide who's good/bad, yet the UC spoonfeeds it to you.<br /><br />Picture quality is amazing (and I am speaking for both the DC and the UC here since they both have the same picture quality); I remember when The Dark Knight came out on blu-ray and people were oh-so-swayed by its supposedly amazing picture quality yet I couldn't get my mind past the failed attempts to recapture the IMAX scenes, the distracting edge enhancement and the shifting F-stop in some scenes. Whereas Watchmen looks vintage and sharp- a lovely film grain enhances the 80s feel of the movie, the colors are really vibrant (especially in the Dr. Manhattan scenes and Laurie's coat in the \\"Forest room\\" interrogation scenes). The Audio is fantastic too- though not different than the DC.<br /><br />In short, it is worth purchasing, but for the packaging only.er 12 watching the movie. Rorschach good! Veidt bad!

0646418432|5.0|Agatha Christie's Mysterious Affair at Styles (Hercule Poirot Mysteries) by Agatha Christie<br />The Mysterious Affair at Styles, Agatha Christie's first mystery novel, introduced Belgian detective Hercules Poirot to what has grown to be legions of readers in the intervening years since its publication in 1920.  Poirot springs onto the pages fully formed. The retired Belgian police detective is quirky, not to say eccentric, but brilliant. He is that \\"odd little man\\" who uses \\"the little gray cells\\" to solve cunningly hidden crimes.<br /><br />Christie's typically complicated plot keeps the reader guessing along with Poirot's friend and narrator Lieutenant Hastings. Clue after clue leads us down one blind alley after another. Reading tip: If Hastings thinks he has figured something out, you can be sure he has it backwards. Christie adheres to this rule without exception - almost.<br /><br />By the way, I highly recommend the TV series in which David Suchet captures Hercules Poirot perfectly For example: ([[ASIN:B001AOC9G8 Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection]]). Albert Finney and Peter Ustinov have also given entertaining portrayals. Christie's Miss Marple, on the other hand, has been tackled by numerous actresses, but none has succeeded like Suchet has with Poirot. My favorite Marple is Margaret Rutherford who played the role in four movies made in the 1960s ([[ASIN:B000CRR374 The Agatha Christie Miss Marple Movie Collection (Murder at the Gallop / Murder Ahoy / Murder Most Foul / Murder She Said)]]).<br /><br />The Mysterious Affair at Styles is a delightfully entertaining mystery and a `must read' for any fan of the mystery genre. Christie's books, while they give a peak at sordid doings, are reliably comfortable and satisfying reads and as far from unsettling or noirish as one can imagine.

B001PPLJJ0|5.0|THE READER in the form of Bernard Schlink's masterful book made an emotional impact on those who read it. And for once the book to film version holds nearly as much agony and beauty as the original. The screenplay is by David Hare (whose transformation of 'The Hours' was so worthy) and it captures not only the dialogue of Schlink's novel but fills in the silences with well-constructed added commentary. Stephen Daldry ('The Hours', 'Billy Elliot') directs with great sensitivity to not only the narrative story but to the myriad metaphors that fill the quiet spaces in both the novel and the film.<br /><br />Michael Berg (David Kross, a significant discovery!) lives in Berlin, falls ill with Scarlet Fever, and is given shelter from the rain and cold by a stern appearing Hanna (Kate Winslet). When Michael recovers from his illness he returns to Hanna's flat to thank her for her kindness and there begins a strange and beautiful love affair between a virginal shy lad and an older but obviously emotionally flat yet needy woman. Despite Michael's family's disdain for his absences away from home, Michael surrenders himself to the passion of love and Hanna softens as she pleads for Michael to read to her. Reading and sex become exchanges for this rare couple until Hanna disappears. Michael discovers her some ears later when Hanna is on trial for war crimes (she had been a guard in the concentration camps). Hanna allows her guilt to override reality in confessing she had been the one who had written the orders for the extermination of Jews - this despite the fact that Hanna is illiterate, a fact known only to Michael.<br /><br />While Hanna is imprisoned Michael (now Ralph Fiennes) records his reading of books to send to Hanna and during Hanna's twenty years of confinement she learns to read and write because of Michael's efforts and gifts. Once Hanna is scheduled to be released from prison and the prison matron convinces Michael to be in charge of the aging Hanna, the story takes turns and the ending is so gently painful that sharing it would ruin the impact for those who have neither read the book nor seen the film.<br /><br />Winslet, Kross, and Fiennes are excellent in these very difficult roles. Their performances are enhanced with the supporting cast that includes special cameos by Lena Olin and Bruno Ganz and some other fine German actors. The mood of the film is gray except of the isolated moments of bliss Michael and Hanna share and the atmosphere is well balanced by the musical score of Nico Muhly. This is a film worth viewing repeatedly, there are that many layers of meaning to glean from this cinematic triumph.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|I am a big fan of Michael Jackson's music and his stage presence.  This is a really cool behind the scenes look at what goes in to putting this kind of production together.  It is about everyone involved in the shows and how they all contribute.  I have watched this many times and I enjoy it every time.
0440241901|5.0|I have never experienced a book quite as hilarious as this one.  This is my first Kinsella book and I absolutely loved it.  The story is fun, light-hearted, and very entertaining. I found myself laughing so hard at times, I thought I was going to wake the entire house up.  Very worthy read if you're looking for a light and fun read.
B000W4RFHK|4.0|Rereading the Dharma Bums after probably a ten-year hiatus, I am struck by how foreign the beatniks seem to us today and how that impression must have been magnified tenfold for the Leave It To Beaver folks whom we are told ran the country back in the fifties.  Then again Ray, Kerouac's protagonist, hitchhiked back and forth across America and found a surprising degree of tolerance if not admiration from the people stopping to give him a ride.  Maybe that's just the nature of people on the move or maybe America wasn't really 100% homogenous like the beats and the flower children who followed them claimed.<br /><br />It would do \\"the kids today\\" good to read this book.  I'll wager at least half of them won't get past the poetic language with which Kerouac writes his alleged prose.  For the texting generation, Kerouac might as well be Shakespeare.  A quick read fails to fully appreciate the music in his words.  Slow down and enjoy.<br /><br />For those willing to embrace this new language, a world governed by thought, belief, emotion, experience, appreciation for nature and attention to basic human needs is unveiled; a world plunked down in the midst of the newborn consumer-driven American society governed by brands, advertising, the lure of \\"convenience,\\" and the first hesitant salvos of pop culture.  Kerouac's characters are as well-versed in Buddhism as the Middle America folks they meet are fluent in Christianity.  For an introduction to American Zen Buddhism as it emerged in the beat culture of the fifties and early sixties, read Alan Watt's The Way of Zen [[ASIN:0375705104 The Way of Zen]] and then read The Dharma Bums, looking up and studying every reference to Buddhism you don't understand.  It's on my list of things to do, along with hiking to Desolation Peak.  If you ever listened to the Doors and didn't understand why Jim Morrison sang \\"the West is the best,\\" read The Dharma Bums and then Steinbeck's Cannery Row[[ASIN:014200068X Cannery Row: (Centennial Edition)]], and you'll begin to see, if not agree.  It wouldn't have broken my heart if the last half of the book had been devoted to Ray's two months on Desolation Peak instead of just the last ten pages, but his adventures hitch-hiking, sitting in his family's woods, sleeping beneath the stars and eucalyptus trees, and riding the rails on the Midnight Ghost are worth every page devoted to them.

0307454541|3.0|Parents and teachers are advised that while this is a cracking good story, it has some extremely disturbing scenes and themes. Larrson is writing first and foremost to bring attention to the extensive, and largely ignored, history of physical and sexual abuse of women in Sweden. SPOILER WARNING: (1) Lisbeth Salander (the girl with the dragon tattoo) is a perfect representation of the damaged, tattooed, pierced, anti-social, emotionally-stunted girl who seems to be everywhere in film and literature today. What is disturbing about this phenomenon is that it is these elements of these characters that make them sexually appealing to others. Salander is abused by her vile legal guardian in the most disturbing and graphic scenes, and she takes her revenge in a similar - though much less disturbing - manner. (2) The father of Harriet - the girl who is suspected to have been murdered - was a Nazi who raped his son Martin as well as Harriet, tortured & murdered countless women, and taught Martin as a teen to do the same. When Harriet could no longer put up with the abuse she murdered her father. Martin saw this and blackmailed her into becoming his personal sex slave (both are teens at this point). Martin has a torture chamber in his house where he has tortured and murdered women for decades. (3) There are some relatively graphic sex scenes. The characters all seem to be sleeping with everyone else. Blomkist, the protagonist, has been having a 20 year affair with his married best friend whose husband doesn't seem to mind. In sum, whilst being a brilliantly intriguing novel, take care.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Some people have expressed disappointment with Avatar.  I can only imagine that this was because they could not find the game controller during the entire film.  Perhaps they felt let down because of the aspects of drama and human interest were mixed in with the action.  Perhaps some part of the storyline seemed too familiar with the real world.  Perhaps the failure to liberate Pandora and make it free and democratic was a rub with some.  However, I found it to be spectacular with good character development and morals.  Packed with action, fantasy, stunning visual effects, and a love story on top of it all.  If you get a chance to see it at the movies in 3D you will be glad you did and you will most likely want the DVD when it comes out.  I must admit that I fell in love with a girl that never was and she is blue.  I have always been a sucker for that.
B002T921DE|5.0|This Blu-ray DVD is the reason why I got a Blu-ray player.  The concert is incredible. I went to see his concert and would have to say this DVD is one of the best if not the best concert DVD I have seen(I own about 40 DVD concerts). Now I am hooked on Blu-ray.  The sound quality & picture quality is amazing.  I give George Michael kudos for putting out an incredible DVD.  He hasn't gone on tour for like 15yrs; this DVD makes up for it as I can watch it again; again and again.  If you are remotely a George Michael fan, buy this you won't regret. everything about it is fantastic
B002VPE1AW|5.0|There are a lot of wonderful in-depth reviews for this movie and I'm a johnny come lately. I know, however, that I have been well fed if after three weeks of seeing the movie I am still thinking about it :-) How many movies can you say have had an impact on you, an impact strong enough to help you rethink about what we take for granted and how easy it is for some humans to take something that isn't theirs to take. It's a story that has been told by many people and cultures about living in a place of stark beauty and the monster of envy crushing that beauty. In this story the people fight back but they aren't enough to push back the intruders what transpires thereafter is awe-inspiring to even the most insensitive soul.<br /><br />I have been surprised, however, that there have been a few people who watched the movie and they just plain said: \\"I don't get it.\\" Then I smile because I think that's the theme of Avatar: The war between those who don't get it and those who do.
B002TZS5GU|3.0|First of all, this is not a zombie movie. This is more like the spreading of a big virus, which kill people slowly. Again there is no zombies here. In this movie you won't see people eating people. You may see a dog eating a dead body that's it. Overall is a good movie for any person who enjoy zombie's movies. This movie you will teach you that if some day this happens please make sure to have a lot of clorox and guns with you.
B00004VXF2|3.0|I thought Lou released this to get out of a record contract.  He owed the lable more music, they wouldn't let him out of the contract, so he thought \\"fine\\" I'll give you four sides of noise.  Contract satisfied; screw you.  I don't know where I heard this (I heard it at least twenty years ago) but the way I heard it he simply wanted to move on and his record company insisted he still owed them music so he put this out as a sort of \\"kiss off.\\"  Now, I don't know how much interest he really had in this project - only Lou knows that and who can tell if when discussing the subject he'll actually give us the real story.  I absolutely could be wrong; but I thought that's what happened - he was satisfying a contract so he could move on.  Anybody really know differently?

B002XMGGJM|1.0|LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is another film that follows the long-standing trend of how ineffective our justice system is and how people find it necessary to take the law into their own hands. The last few years, we've seen this a lot with films like THE BRAVE ONE and DEATH SENTENCE. The problem that these films usually face is they treat it either too realistically, or not realistically enough. In the case of LAW ABIDING CITIZEN, it's starts one way and then falls way too far in the other direction.<br /><br />The opening is very realistic and very brutal with the home invasion sequence and the preliminaries to the action, as Foxx does his legal dealings with the devil and Butler deals with the anger and frustration of watching the real killer of his family get a lesser sentence, and it does show promise for the remainder of the film. But once Butler's plan goes into motion, that's when the film really starts to go off the rails. Butler, who is an actor that I really admire, gets to have a lot of fun with this role, but it's not a role that he should be having fun with. His character turns inexplicably from vengeance-seeking father and husband to evil genius in a very short period of screen time. And Foxx's character is so unbearably cocky and smarmy that it's very difficult to root for him, even when Butler's character has done some really evil stuff. And the fact that Butler's character is so much more than he seems to be... it's just a horrible deus ex machina and it's a really hacky premise. He can't just be a normal angry man; he has to be a former government assassin.<br /><br />If they decided to make Butler the hero of this film and maybe give the film a PUNISHER-like angle where the people that he's killing are truly corrupt and evil, and Foxx's character was maybe someone who was caught in the middle of all this insanity... Well, that is a film that would make for a more entertaining and satisfying watch. Alas, they took another road, and it's a road that starts in a world of plausibility and forks off so far into ridiculousness that the film ultimately implodes on itself.<br /><br />F. Gary Gray isn't known much for his thought-provoking films, and is much more of the fast-paced, blow-stuff-up school. THE NEGOTIATOR with Sam Jackson and Kevin Spacey is as close as he's gotten to making a very watchable film, and unfortunately, Butler and Foxx are not Spacey and Jackson.<br /><br />The worst thing about this film is that it really doesn't even seem to have a point. It's just a good premise turned into a bad film.plausibility and forks off so far into ridiculousness that the film ultimately implodes on itself.     F.

B002Y5FKUE|5.0|I need to say that I saw this production of \\"La Sonnambula\\" at the Met with Dessay and Florez. Was I confused by the staging? Yes, a little, not enough to spoil the evening. But, I never dreamed that I would hear and see performances that would come close to the famous Sutherland/Pavarotti recording.    Dessay and Florez were superb (both singing and acting) the night I saw \\"La Sonnambula.\\" The modern dress helped me believe that their characters were really in love in a way that seldom happens in opera. This DVD was filmed at a different performance. But I suspect I was slightly disappointed in the DVD only because watching an opera live, especially with two charismatic stars, is not the same as watching in a neighborhood theater, PBS or DVD.    After viewing the DVD several times, here are some other observations: pro: my confusion about the staging was easily resolved by the end of Act One, Michele Pertusi, Jennifer Black and the chorus give fine performances, how I wish Bellini could have written more operas so Dessay and Florez could do this again and again; anti: the setting is basic and never changes much, except for the two sleep walking scenes.    Mary Zimmermann's production did work completely for me, but I understand her reasoning. For the several reviewers who mentioned that Zimmerman was booed on the opening night, you must really be upset at the way operas are often staged in Europe. This was pretty mild.    So finally buy the DVD for Dessay and Florez. Even if you do not like the staging you will get your money's worth by just listening, although you shall miss two of the most attractive singers in opera today.
0316044938|3.0|The book was written well.  I have to say this is the first time I liked a movie better than a book.  The read was fast but kept going on and on...I really am not a fan of narratives..

0143036424|2.0|Four white high school students lure a female American Indian to a meeting and rape her in a cruel and brutal manner. The woman, Melissa Little Bird, suffers from fetal alcohol syndrom and her reasoning powers are impaired.<br /><br />The trial ends with a rediculous sentence of two years suspended and then parole. The Indian community is incensed that the boys are let off so lightly.<br /><br />Two years later, the ring leader is found dead. The town and sheriff Walt Longmere are attempting to make sense of the killing and then another of the boys is murdered in the same way. Now Walt is certain he's dealing with a revenge killing and wonders why the killer waited so long. He also is concerned for the other two boys.<br /><br />We follow the story with interesting characters and crisp dialogue. It is an interesting start but the characters didn't ring true. This lessened belief in the story. In particular, Walt is a grossly overweight boozhound living in a home he began building years ago but when his wife died, he stopped construction. The home doesn't even have a door on the bathroom. In addition, since Walt is a Viet Nam vet, he has to be in his sixties. With all of this background, his friend Henry Standing Bear is trying to fix him up and encourage him to start dating. We also learn that other women in town find him desireable. I don't see the attraction. The descriptions of Walt would seem to turn women completely off.<br /><br />The conclusion is long in coming and when it does, the actions of one of the central characters are in direct opposition to the personality and prior description of the character to that point.<br /><br />All in all, there were many well done scenes and it is easy to see why this writer had so much success with his future novels.
0345441184|3.0|This is my second read of this book, in an attempt to decipher the magickal traditions behind it. On the positive side, it's a different perspective on the Arthurian legend, meaning a pagan point of view, and female protagonists, for a change. Also kudos for descriptive storytelling and an engaging read. I found myself unable to put it down, even for the second time around. However the dam thing is just too long, by about 300 pages. I got 3/4 of the way through and was ready to cry Enough! How many times do we need to be reminded of everyone's guilt, sin, anguish, ambition, regret, and etc? How many times do we need to play out the argument of pagan-vs-christian, ad nauseam, in a myriad of different settings? And for the love of Gawd how much incest, rape, and repressed sexuality can one take? But I think this is the fault of an over-indulgent editor more than the author. If this was edited correctly it would have been a truly great novel, not merely a good rainy-day read. Historical faults notwithstanding (afterall, it IS fiction), it does paint a pretty picture of Romano-Celtic Britain that gives one inspiration to do further reading. I found that I did like most of the main characters, except Gwenhwyfar -- she was just awful. A one-dimensional, hysterical Barbie doll, who should have been portrayed with more depth and sympathy if this is to be truly a feminist perspective. To make her a raving, jealous, paranoid, fanatical Christian was, IMO, a cop-out. She could have been just as good a counterpoint to Morgaine without being an annoyingly pious shrew. MISTS is not Bradley's best work; I much prefer Priestess of Avalon, which has a much stronger female lead character and does not sink under its own weight.
B0009S4IKQ|4.0|\\"Grand Hotel\\" is the mother of all blockbusters, although it had been preceded by\\"Paramount on Parade\\" (1930), also by director Edmund Goulding. What distinguished \\"Grand Hotel\\" from \\"Parade\\" was that the all star cast were used in a story as characters, rather than an all star review in which the stars played themselves. \\"Grand Hotel\\" was also distinguished by the interlocking stories that, at first, appear unrelated, but slowly merge together, a technique commonplace today, but never before attempted in cinema.<br /><br />Never before (and possibly since) had so many major stars appeared in a single film. Garbo was fresh off two Academy Award nominations (\\"Anna Christie\\" and \\"Romance\\"), Wallace Beery had been nominated as Best Actor for his role in \\"The Big House\\" (1930) and won for \\"The Champ\\" (1932), the Barrymores had just appeared together in \\"Rasputin\\" (1932), John had an enormous success with \\"Svengali\\" (1931) and Lionel had won the Best Actor for \\"A Free Soul\\" (1930), Wallace Stone had been nominated for Best Actor for his role in \\"The Patriot\\" (1929) and played alongside Beery in \\"The Big House\\" (1930).<br /><br />Joan Crawford didn't have the same award pedigree as the others, but by 1932 she was a hit at the box office and her marriage to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. added to her clout. From 1932 through 1936 she was among the top 10 moneymaking stars.<br /><br />The black and white film is crisp and the sound is excellent. Edmund Goulding's direction keeps the nearly 2 hour film moving along quickly, and the changes from one subplot to the next are done seamlessly which was rare in those days. It won the Best Picture award for 1932, beating out \\"The Champ\\" and \\"Five Star Final\\".<br /><br />\\"Grand Hotel\\" is important as a sort of psychodrama, the onscreen roles of the main characters revealing a lot about their personal lives and their off screen personalities. For example...<br /><br />- Contrary to his \\"Aw shucks\\" screen persona, Wallace Beery was known for his violent temper and disagreeable personality. None other than child star Jackie Cooper referred to him as a \\"big disappointment\\" and child actress Margaret O'Brien complained about Beery's constant pinching. Curiously enough, Beery said \\"I hate the lousy part...I told 'em I didn't want to do it...\\" and staged a 2 day strike, to no avail.<br /><br />- Like her on screen character, Garbo vanted to be alone, and by 1935 she had started to withdraw, and in 1941 she would retire. Prior to Grand Hotel she made 2 to 4 films a year; after she made less than 1 per year. There are 23 films prior to 1932 and only 7 after.<br /><br />- John Barrymore plays a renowned Baron who has squandered his wealth and now makes money by playing cars and occasional thievery. In fact Barrymore had squandered his enormous talent and gave perfunctory performances after 1932 in such forgettable films as \\"Night Flight\\", \\"Maytime\\" \\"True Confession\\", etc. Flashes of his former great self were seen only on occasion (e.g., Mercutio in \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in 1936).<br /><br />- John Barrymore romances a stenographer (Joan Crawford) but it is brother Lionel who leaves with her for Paris. In real life, brother John had started a romance with silent screen actress Irene Fenwick but it was brother Lionel who left with her for Paris (ie., married her).<br /><br />- Joan Crawford plays a woman of loose morals, and at the time of \\"Grand Hotel\\" she was married to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. while having an affair with Clark Gable.<br /><br />\\"Grand Hotel\\" won the academy award for Best Picture, however, director Edmund Goulding was not nominated for Best Director, an unusual event since most pictures and directors are nominated together (in fact, it's happened less than a half dozen times). \\"Hotel\\" was not nominated in any other category, although Beery won for his role in \\"The Champ\\" (he tied with Frederic March's \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" - the first and only tie). Director Goulding earned himself the nickname \\"The Lion Tamer\\" for keeping such big egos in check during the filming.<br /><br />Variety said it was better than the stage play and praised the Barrymores and Beery, but called Garbo \\"artificial\\" and said that Crawford was \\"not the most fortunate casting.\\" The New York Herald called the film \\"dull\\" John Barrymore said that Beery was \\"the best actor on the set\\" and the Des Moines Register agreed.<br /><br />The film will appeal to fans of 30s films and to people who enjoy blockbusters. It's also a great chance to see these legendary actors in one place.it was better than the stage play and praised the Barrymores and Beery, but called Garbo \\"artificial\\" and said that Crawford was \\"not the most fortunate casting.\\" The New York Herald called the film \\"dull\\" John Barrymore said that Beery was \\"the best actor on the set\\" and the Des Moines Register agreed.

0440242401|5.0|Oh my well you can never expect anything less than wonderful in any of Sophie Kinsella's books.  I was in love with all the other books from her Shopaholic series as well as many in between like \\"Can You Keep a Secret\\" or \\"Undomestic Godess.\\"  To many she may be a newer discovery because of the movie release, I however have been a fan for years.  I think she has truly wowed me this time.    \\"Remember Me?\\" captures that romantic comedy feeling with a sexy ooh-la-la at the same time.  I love how real her characters seem, very well written and very idetifiable.  The main female character, Lexi Smart made me laugh, feel nervous and want more all at the same time.  I won't give away any details, but you will love this book and if you do love it and you have not read \\"Can You Keep a Secret,\\" then you must read that too! They had a similiar feeling to me as far as flow and the love relationship.  Enjoy!!!!
B0017XCDN6|4.0|Although this movie is good overall it is disappointing in it's presentation of General K. . The book describes and/or presents the General in a much more favorable light as both a man and a general.  The film seems to portray him in such a way as to lead one to believe he was inept, cowardly, and self-absorbed.  The movie left much to be desired in it's presentation of the tunnel system the Japanse built and completely ignored the lack of food, fresh water, etc. that was a day to day situation on the island even before the battle started. I felt the movie did a great diservice to the Japanse in terms of being a worthy adversary for the Americans, their dedication to their country, their determination to win a loseing battle when it became clear they would lose and their dedication to their general.  The book was excellent, the movie enjoyable but disappointing.

Together they try to solve this mystery.<br /><br />The book started a bit slow, and I found myself wishing I had a map of Sweden by me as I read the book.  It gives an interesting insight into the lives of the Swedes, and the book becomes increasingly scary and exciting.  By the middle of the book, I didn't want to put it down,and found myself reading long into the night.<br /><br />There is an excerpt of \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", the second in the series.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, and hope others find it as engrossing as I did!

Richard gave a lot of himself in this book, and -to me- is a piece of historical information, and extremely helpful kit for those in the animation business... but also for those who don't know anything about animation and what to have a very cool book.  Worth having.

0312117337|1.0|Dear Amazon,    I don't even want to give this one star, I was so shocked at the quality of this product! This was a birthday present for one of my best friends, and we discovered that when she pulled her first card the pages were out of order and not even printed sequentially, page 56 than goes to 123 so some pages are actually missing altogether.    I would of course like my money back or to exchange this deck of cards for one that is of excellent quality, and I'm not sure how to go about that.    Thank you,  Susan Stanko
B001AQO3WY|5.0|Generation Kill the series took an already awesome book, and made it a visual and personal masterpiece.  There was great character development, and the story flowed at an exciting pace.  The comedy made this movie a truly wonderful experience for me.   I would recommend this to anyone who liked Band of Brothers.
B002VH7P4O|1.0|Very disappointing.  Product arrived in original packaging that had the seal broken!  The Apple \\"stem\\" was broken.  This is unlike Amazon to ship items that had obviously already been returned damaged.  The \\"Stem\\" is a huge problem on this item, I've learned.  Great idea...but buyer beware.  And surprised that Amazon would handle in such a poor product management fashion.  Unlike them.
1582701709|4.0|The Bible says in Psalms chapter 82 verse 6 that you are gods. With that position comes power and authority. This book taps into that power and authority. We are not victims, but authors of our lives. This life goes by so so quickly; why not live it with joy ,hope, and power. A great read that should be part of every library.
B0002EXH40|4.0|Not as good as their last 2 masterpieces, CTE and RIP but it's still a good album. Lighter, more melodic and commercial but not bad at all. I Thought I Knew It All is one of their best songs ever. Youthanasia is their last great '90s album and before they go downhill. It's not thrash metal anymore, it's more progressive metal and hard rock. It's not essential but it's worth owning.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|The special features are really good, i enjoyed the talk with the author and the set tour with Craig Horner.This series is worth every dollar!!!! I Love it!!! I love the storyline and am thinking of purchasing the books.
B0009A40ES|4.0|Updated review: I now have read the book, and it made me realize that this is a genius interpertation by the astute filmmakers! Tackling this massive, bitterly cynical satirical (and at times boring) book, and giving it a focus, heart, and soul is nothing short of amazing! I congratulate the filmmakers and upgrade my review from three to four star ratings.<br /><br />Initial review prior to reading the book: I never read the book but intend to now. I really never had interest in seeing this movie because I utterly despise horror movies which I thought this is. As it started to unfold I said to my wife this is not a horror film, but a sophsticated  New York thriller (not realzing the writer was British). The dialogue impressed me (I didn't know it came from the book). I loved him taking offense to the anti-Semitic remaks of his idiot Wall Street colleague. Then I wondered how Bateman can carry a dead body across the lobby trailing blood and nothing happened. Then it became so absurd I started to lay back and laugh because it was so over the top. It took until the closing scenes(visit to what we thought was Paul's apartment) for me to finally realize that we've been cleverly manipulated and all the murders were all in Bateman's head, fantasies. Then I finally realized it was a twisted satire. Now I need to see it all again to sure, but after I read the book. The social commentary was kinda lost but I thought the music trivia was great, fitting in with Tarantino's and TV influenced writing which resorts to a lot of off-the-nose trivia. Do I recommend this film? Yes. If you haven't read the book, it's grippng in its own twisted way and Bale is great. You really believe he's crazy, which he is, even if find out later it's all in his head. It's weird but simultaneously brilliant filmmaking.
0967984602|4.0|I was very pleased with the shopping experience at Amazon.com. In searching for the subject I was interested in, I found a great selection. The review and write up on the book was extensive enough for me to make a buying decision at that moment.    The book itself is very helpful and informative on the subject of building an earth oven. The directions were easy to follow. The photographs were very interesting and sparked a lot of ideas for my own project.    Mary B. Suchopar
B000N4SHPS|4.0|Just the way Rocky Balboa likes it, this film goes up against all conceivable odds and somehow succeeds.  The obstacles are substantial - even if you take the \\"how in the world can anyone be expected to buy a man Stallone's age as able to hold his own against the heavyweight champ?\\" issue out of the equation.  Does the audience even care about this guy any more?  Can Talia Shire's absence be compensated for?  Will Rocky's relationship with his son be even remotely plausible?  Can the bombast that is Bill Conti's score, not to mention the tunes penned by Sly's brother Frank Stallone, be endured for another hour and 42 minutes?  It really is amazing that, with so much seemingly working against it, this film is a pleasure to watch.  Yes, it walks the same well-worn road every other \\"Rocky\\" film has, both literally and figuratively.  Yes, there's no way to replace Burgess Meredith, and his absence has been felt keenly since \\"Rocky III.\\"  But Rocky and his son seem believable, his burgeoning relationship with Little Marie feels real (and she's no young cookie, thankfully), and the climactic fight is emotionally satisfying in that \\"Rocky\\" way - you know, that \\"man, I wish real heavyweight fights were this much fun to watch!\\" way.  They throw more punches in one round than most heavyweight fights see in 15.  Yes, there are problems; the reigning heavyweight champ is very two-dimensional (and would never be as universally hated as he is portrayed, regardless of his demeanor - lots of people love to cheer for self-absorbed thugs), the commentary by Jim Lampley and others is chock full of cliches, and it's all just so predictable.  But, in spite of all that, I really enjoyed watching it - simply because Stallone has created an imminently likeable character in Rocky Balboa, one you can't help but care about and cheer for.  Let's hope what Rocky says to Paulie at the end is true, though - let's hope the beast that is the \\"Rocky\\" franchise is out of Stallone's system.  I doubt he could pull this off again.e could pull this off again.
B000068TPN|5.0|Being one for whom the Viet Nam War was 'my' war, and this 1965 action was the first major battle for our boys, I could not help buying it and watching it often. The brides of the courageous men are well depicted here, and Mel does a wonderful job playing Hal Moore....one of our Country's true leaders...
0316010669|3.0|The book was interesting and I enjoy learning about common things on a deeper level.  But I thought the book was a little contradictary.  In some stories he talked about those first 2 seconds, the results of \\"thin slicing\\", and the appropriate response from it and other times the inappropriate response occurred.  It had me a little confused.  After reading the book (well really I listened to it on CD) I had to go and read what the book was about again.  Then I realized more that it's about the \\"thin slicing\\" the right information in those first few seconds.  Interesting information but I thought by the end of the book I would have learned how better to think without thinking and I don't think I did.  I WOULD be interested in doing some of the facial expression recognition training videos he talked about though!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is my favorite purchase except for the suspense thriller, Peak Experience by Bud Connell! Also available on Kindle. [[ASIN:061523304X Peak Experience: A Novel]]
0553381687|1.0|If you like a story that is unfinished, then this may be the series for you.  Read user comments on the last book of this series.  The author has lost interest in this story.  If you don't mind unfinished stories with seemingly obscure plot direction, so many characters that you have scratch your head and say \\"Who is this guy again?\\", this series is for you.<br /><br />The author lost control of his story line and now can't come up with decent way to tie it all together for the reader.  The signs were there in the time it took the author to come up with the next book.<br />It becomes a rambling, directionless mess toward the end.<br /><br />Avoid it and the author, it will only frustrate most readers.
B002X9W50E|4.0|Unlike what the product description and several reviews say, this is not a live greatest hits or a good starter for new Bowie listeners.  This is a good concert CD of Bowie, but part of why it is good is that it gives seasoned Bowie fans more than just the hits played as you would hear them on the original albums.  This CD really only containts a handful of his hits, and most songs sound quite different from how they sound on the studio releases.  Bowie and the band improvise quite a bit, so every song is unique in its sound from anything a Bowie fan has heard before.  If you are new to Bowie, then I would recommend getting one of his greatest hits compilations or going back almost to the beginning and getting his third studio album, The Man Who Sold The World.  If you are already a Bowie fan, then this is a fine album to give you even more Bowie.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Penned by Neil Gaiman, this clever little story has been translated into a movie courtesy of the same stop-motion animation seen in Tim Burton's \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and \\"The Corpse Bride\\".  Similar to those films we have a \\"spooky, but cute\\" look to everything--gloomy skies, lurid colors, and an odd assortment of supernatural creatures.<br /><br />It appears that \\"Coraline\\" tries to be a horror movie for children, and at this it succeeds rather well: it has a fairy-tale theme revolving around wishes that go bad, sinister magic that comes from an eerie past, and dark secrets that test a child's resolve.  Without giving away too much of the plot, Coraline feels neglected after having to move to a new state.  She's dealing with work-at-home parents who don't want to be interrupted, so she tries to busy herself poking around the big old house they've moved into.  As she makes discoveries in their new home, Coraline has to choose between the life she has and the one she's being promised...and as always in fairy tales, such promises can come with a terrible price.  My ten-year-old daughter read the book to this movie, and indicated that while some minor parts of the story were modified, the changes made the story translate better to film.<br /><br />This film is rated \\"PG\\" for some scary situations, and some of its visuals might be unnerving:  for example, while many of the creatures are not real, they \\"die\\" by disintegrating into piles of sand.  There are scary visuals reminiscent of \\"Beetlejuice\\" and \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\", such as malformed monsters or startling shots of things jumping out at the viewer, but nothing your kids would consider as \\"gross\\" or \\"icky\\" as the imagery in \\"Corpse Bride\\".  Smaller children may find some moments too scary or intense, but the 8-12 year old set will definitely get an enjoyable thrill.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I love this CD, I love all of Micheal Buble's songs, but I think this CD is my favorite.He adds his own signature to the songs Georgia in my mind and Cry me a river.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This is a movie that everyone should see.  Your long term health depends on it!  The influence that fast food has had on the way our food is produced is downright scary.  I was a regular at McDonald's (and others) before seeing this movie, and now I select my meals out very carefully.  I'll have to slip in for some McD's fries every once in a while, but I don't think I'll ever eat those burgers again.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Loved it! I've watched it through several times and I still love it. No, it is certainly not for children or prudes. but, for the rest of us it's good clean fun!
B0019LY5IM|5.0|My husband LOVES Lost. It's our tradition to watch it together each week for some hangin' out time. Since the first season showed up on CD, I've bought him a box set each year. This year's set came out just in time for a Valentine surprise. He's happy.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|Young Victoria is the story of Queen Victoria's early years. Emily Blunt stars as Queen Victoria, and she was nominated for quite a few Best Actress awards, most notably, the Golden Globe.<br /><br />The film begins a year before Victoria becomes Queen and continues through the first few years of her reign. I was not terribly familiar with Queen Victoria's early life, and I found the film fascinating. Emily Blunt shines as Victoria. She plays her with a beautiful mix of energy, youthfulness, spunk and properness. This Victoria is caring, idealistic and eager. Part of the story focuses on Victoria's desire for love and uneasiness about finding a partner who will love her for her rather her throne. Through a modern lens, it's both a beautiful and frightening love story. It's a quick courtship, and it works for them, but the modern skeptic in me cannot imagine a courtship of mostly letters, especially when you're the Queen of England and have so much to protect.<br /><br />It is a love story, but it's mostly a fascinating look at the role of royalty and the role of women at the time. Victoria is aware of her fortune and prestige, even as she longs to rebel against it and reach the real people. All in all, it's a lovely little film. What keeps it from being a great film, despite Emily Blunt's strongly nuanced performance, was my lack of emotional involvement with the story. Despite not knowing much about this time period, I felt somewhat removed from the events. It's a personal reaction, and I'm curious to know if others felt a similar disconnect. I do recommend seeing the film, but it doesn't quite make my ten best of the year list.
0307269981|5.0|The second in Larrson's series, again, this is a well written book.  Lots of intrigue.  Loved it as much as his first book, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Really looking forward to his third, and, sadly, his last book.

The construction is very solid.
0307387178|5.0|Chris McCandless graduated with top of the class grades from Emory University, a stellar athlete, and fun person to be around. He was from a well to do family, had a nice sister, and many friends and relatives. What made him do it? What made him want to leave his home, and hike across the country to the Alaskan wilderness alone and without really any provisions or supplies to sustain him in such an unforgiving environment?    Chris graduated from Emory College in 1988 and soon after began a journey of a lifetime. His journey came to a close in 1992 when his body was found by two moose hunters in a deserted bus two-hundred miles northwest of Fairbanks, Alaska. Although his journey at times seems foolish and unintelligent, there are many lessons that can be taken away from it.    In the bestselling narrative, Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer, the author attempts to uncover what made this young man leave all of his possessions and family behind. The wild can be a scary place. Denali National Forest is one of the harshest climates in the world. During the winter, it can reach temperatures of fifty below. \\"Alexander Supertramp,\\" a drifter, a free soul, wandering the country with nothing but his pack on his back, is Chris McCandless transformed into a somewhat mythic character who dares to defy nature itself.  Christopher loved his times as a hitchhiker. He gave himself this name at the outset of his journey. This novel made me greatly appreciate nature, and the power that it has. At any time nature has the ability to end a life. We must always remember that. It is not often that a young man has the vision and peace of mind to leave his home and everything he knows. He is able to see what is really important in his life, hence, the donation of his life savings to a worthy charity. He is able to see through the affluence around him, and look past the mansions and technology to see what is really crucial in life, love, passion, and the freedom to make choices for oneself. Somedepict Supertramp as being arrogant, foolish, and stupid for attempting to take on the wilderness. I see him as a young man, whose curiosity and appreciation for nature make him want to be a part of it.    Krakauer who would become famous a year later for his book Into Thin Air, was marvelous in his depiction of nature and Supertramp's journey across the country. His ability to captivate the readers mind into the situation is truly spectacular. His use of knowledgeable vocabulary, and in-depth knowledge of the character and his beliefs, allow him to show the reader what McCandless was thinking and saying at all times    One can say whatever he wants about the stupidity of a young man with nothing more than a large bag of rice, and a Plants and Animals Guide for Alaska, to attempt to survive in the wilderness. But it is truly amazing that if not for a passage left out of the guide, he very well may have walked out of there come spring.   Christopher Johnson McCandless was a young man from a well to do family, who was able to invent a new name and life for himself.   \\"I will miss you too, but you are wrong if you think that the joy of life comes principally from the joy of human relationships. God's place is all around us, it is in everything and in anything we can experience. People just need to change the way they look at things, - Christopher McCandless.\\"

B002T9H2L0|1.0|I don't usually review movies but this movie starts out well but then Brad Pitt gets involved.  I like Brad Pitt where did he find that southern accent at the dollar store.  Did they just give up on making it worth while.  I hope they didn't spend much on this because this movie is middle of the road B movie.  The bar room scene/chapter was longer then it should have been.  Only two chapters are worth watching with the bar room being longer then needed.  The chapter at the show had the complete upper elite echelon of the Reich attending a preimer showing of a hero of the Reich's deeds.  It had two soldiers guarding Hitler and maybe ten others guarding elsewhere.  The whole chapter was a joke.  It seems more like the scene was from national lampoon vs this movie.  The scenes happen because the writter said it happened.  This movie will be $7.99 by year end.  What a complete waste of two and 1/2 hours.  I would like to carve into Brad Pitt's head that he \\"sucks\\" its that bad.
0307454541|2.0|For about the first 150-200 pages I thought this was going to go down as one of my favorite books.  I was even getting fairly excited about reading the next two books in the series.  Unfortunately the ending was not nearly as well crafted as the setup, and was borderline predictable.  The writer also did something that a lot of hacks typically do.  The main character was clearly based on the author, so of course this guy is also irresistible to any woman he comes across.  And of course every girl he gets down with also has to mention how amazing he is in bed, and they can't seem to get enough of this stud, who of course is totally nonchalant about hooking up with all these chicks despite being a boring old man.  Very lame aspect of the book.  This alone will keep me from reading the next two books in the series.

B002TZS5GU|2.0|If you like hallmark made-for-tv movies, then this is for you. If you hate hallmark with a run-like-a-zombie passion, avoid this. This is a film about the emotional aspect of having to outlived the dead by somekind of plague. VERY EMOTIONAL but not a tear jerker. Just average.

B000Y2WAKM|5.0|Being 50+ Ive had streachs where I didnt really listen to music like I did in my 20s- I kinda try to get stuff from groups I have heard of but never really listened to at the time- Alice in chains-Stone temple pilots- Concrete Blonde I guess there all kind of in the same time period. But I never really herd of these guys. I think I was watching a movie and liked a song- the C.C. caught the name of the band and song so I bought this. Great stuff I loved the videos- and the music is Great- as far as I can tell this might be the most overlooked rock band of all time. If your looking for some great Rock this should fill your bill.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This movie finishes the the main story line of the series Firefly.  The special effects are well done.  They are true to the science of space flight having the spacecraft 'Serenity' fly through space in silence. The innuendo is done extremely well.  There are many scenes in which the subtle humor is very funny. I have enjoyed this movie very much.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was amazed I had never heard of this game until now. A friend of ours recommended it while visiting, so we ran out and purchased the game right away. That night we played until 1 AM in the morning. This game is fun!    The instruction book is rather large, but the gist of the game is on the first two pages. My 8-year old daughter picked up the game right away and now wants to play all the time. I really like the fact that the game play is different every time. It is definitely a strategy style game and take a few games under your belt to start developing your own strategies.    Our edition came with extra plastic bags for all the pieces. And everything fits nicely into the box. The game board, at first, fit very tight into the surrounding edges. I found that if I took some of the hex pieces and just rubbed the edges on the table to flatten out the nubs created when punching them out of the cardboard that it fit nicely into the surrounding pieces. You might want to do that too.    If you like playing games, this is a must. This is our new 'family game night' game to play. For two players, the game play lasts 30 minutes to an hour. You can figure that for every extra person play, it will add about 30 minutes or so to the game play.    You can't go wrong buying this game!
B001993Y2C|5.0|I read a lot of complaints about the packaging before i made my purchase.  Anyone who would let the packaging come between themselves and this set is really missing out.  I agree, not the greatest boxing job I've ever seen, but as far as not wanting to own the Blu-Ray BSG complete... This set has so much top offer, and the show itself is incredible.  Packaging was the last thing i was thinking about as i was watching!  Well worth the money, BattleStar on blu-ray is amazing!

B001FB55L2|5.0|I saw this film in the theatres and thought it was amazing!  Not only is it timely, but it's one of those stories which could actually happen,   which gives it even more gravity. Tobey Maguire gives what I think is one of the  best performances of his career...so far!   He just oozes all the right emotions to bring this character to life in a way   that leaps off the screen!---He's intense in this!!  Jake Gyllenhaal is also great as the well-intentioned brother who tries to   compensate for what they all think is his brother's death (MIA), stepping in   as a father figure to his nieces and comforting his grieving sister-in-law,   who is played very well by Natalie Portman.    Jake's character is kind of the black sheep of the family with a rowdy past,  but he truly redeems himself in the wake of what he thinks is his brother's  death. Natalie and Jake's characters begin to fall in love, which is   weird for both of them, given the situation. But they restrain themselves  for the moment. Then all of a sudden the brother/husband/father appears   back on the scene, having been through hell as an afghani POW who has been  tortured and force to do a horrible thing that really destroys him both   mentally and spiritually. When he returns, his experiences in the middle east   have drastically changed him from the person who they all knew before he left for the war.   The story gets more and more intense and without giving away anymore,   it just suffices to say that this is one of the best films of 2009/2010.  A great add to any DVD collection.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|This is one of the best albums that I have heard.  From the beginning to the end Alicia Keys shows you why she is one of the best entertainers in the world.
B002VECM4A|5.0|Gabourey Sidibe, a first-time actress with no previous acting experience,   walks into an open casting call for a film based on a book she'd never read before,   and on the sheer strength of her personality and intuitiveness about the character   which she is reading for...she lands the leading role, Precious Jones, in one of   the most powerful and talked about films of 2009!  That in itself sounds like a treatment for a screenplay, but it's all too real  and a star was truly found in this huge untapped talent.   But she shares this breakthrough performance with another amazing performance   which alot of people didn't see coming...  The damaged, sick, and downright evil character who is Precious' mother,   Mary Jones, played with scarry intensity and zeal by comedienne / actress /   talk show host MONIQUE!!  WOW!!---She scared the crap out of alot of people with her absolutely despicable  potrayal of a character who has been so kicked in the head and wounded by life  that she has become a warped monstrous shell of a human being!  Her Golden Globe, SAG & Brit wins as well as her Oscar nom for best supporting   actress is well deserved and many expect her to win the Oscar on March 7, 2010.  Gabourey Sidibe, despite turning in a great performance and being nominated  in all of the same awards, did score a win at the 2010 NAACP Image Awards  for best actress in a dramatic role.    I must say that this film wouldn't have flown as high as it did without  the stellar & soulful direction of Lee Daniels, the supporting cast, or the   production power players that are Tyler Perry and Oprah Winfrey!  This movie was so heart-wrenchingly raw and filled with such emotional angst  that there were times that I found myself clinching up in my seat or covering  my eyes or mouth in disbelief at the harrowing abuse and circumstances which  Precious has to endure at the hands of her mother, her father, and just life in general!  I found myself asking why do some people have to go through such things in this life,  and yet they go on with their heads held up as best they can!  It also made me appreciate the fact that though many of us have had struggles  in this life, there is always somebody else's story who comes along to make  us say \\"Well, my god!--At least I didn't have it THAT bad!!--I should be thankful!\\"  This story would just be too painful, too deep, too unbearable to watch,   if it weren't for the levity of the supporting cast, mainly Lenny Kravitz's   portryal of a compassionate (and hot!) male nurse, and of course the teacher   at the school for wayward girls that Precious has to attend,  played beautifully by actress Paula Patton. What else can I say, other than  this is a very special film which may be too strong for some people,  but I think it's brilliant and worth having in your collection in the same  way that movies like \\"The Color Purple\\", \\"Bastard Out Of Carolina\\" and others are.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|This series wonderfully depicts the nonsensical lunacy of Wooster and his man servant, Jeeves.  If you like harmless family fun set in the arto deco period, then this is for you.  Hugh Laurie is great as Wooster and Stephen Fry excels as Jeeves.  Essentially, the stories revolve around Wooster and his mates trying to get or avoid getting married to various women.  Jeeves is the only brain amongst the crew and always manages to extricates Wooster and his mates from some minor troubles.
0812973992|5.0|ONE OF MY FAVORITE BOOKS OF ALL-TIME.  I STAYED EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED WITH THIS FROM THE BEGINNING TO THE END  I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY TO EVERYONE
1416595554|5.0|This is the first book of Simon Montefiore's that I have read so far, and I was amazingly impressed. I am very interested in Russian history and this book brings a huge amount of material fact about Russia in the 20th century forth, without bogging down he story line or turning the novel into a textbook. The reader absorbs the historical context without realizing it, as Monefiore so seamlessly makes it part of the story and the characters. The historical scope is broad (but maintains detail) He is able to add a personal touch to the characters that takes the novel WAY father than your average historical fiction, making the characters so real and touchable, you can't help but get tangled up in the story. He maintains the reality and honesty of the characters and the plot, keeping it from going over the top (as it does in books by other authors such as Empress and Memoirs of a Geisha) making the story real and approachable.  I actually teared up at parts of the book!  Absolutely amazing. I also loved how the author remains an impartial observer - he doesn't assign \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" to the Bolshevik Revolution like many others do; he merely presents a snapshot of what life was like for the people involved. I would definitely recommend, and I plan on reading the rest of his work, including his non fiction. Beautiful, beautiful book.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Miller's version of Knightly is smashing. I absolutely loved him in this role. All of the actors were perfectly cast, really superb acting through and through. Emma's character is rather sweet and extremely likeable. Romola Garia really shines here. I really think Garai and Miller are the best Emma and Mr. Knightly ever.    It is such a delightful movie. All of Austen's wit is represented but it also has one toe in the 21st century.     I loved the choice of location for Hartfield, It has lots of regency authenticity and yet reflects a warm and charming atmosphere that is portrayed in the book.     Absolutely perfect!
B00004XQ8H|5.0|Some reviewers seem to think that Bohm is brisk in his pacing of the Four Last Songs. I find that he rushes only the last one, Im Abendrot. More objectionable is Bohm's cramped phrasing and lack of expressive flexibility. The other timings don't feel too fast, even though they certainly aren't slow. For the record:<br /><br />Fruhling: Karajan/Schwarzkopf 3:01<br />  Szell/ Schwarzkopf  3:46<br />  Karajan/ Janowitz  4:03<br />  Bohm/ della casa  3:19<br />  Masur/ J. Norman  3:43<br /><br />September: Karajan/Schwarzkopf 3:49<br />  Szell/ Schwarzkopf 5:17<br />  Karajan/ Janowitz  4:49<br />  Bohm/ della casa  4:03<br />  Masur/ J. Norman  5:26<br /><br />Beim Schlafengehen: Karajan/Schwarzkopf 5:03<br />  Szell/ Schwarzkopf 5:22<br />  Karajan/ Janowitz  6:13<br />  Bohm/ della casa  5:16<br />  Masur/ J.

Norman  9:54<br /><br />As these timings bear out, Bohm is radically fast in the final song and generally fast througout, though in league with Karajan and schwarzkopf in their live reading; Schwarzkopf's first studio recording with Otto Ackermann in mono was also generally brisk.<br /><br />I can second all the praise given to these vintage recordings from della Casa, whose silvery lyric soprano was heightened with a touch of inward melancholy that perfeclty suited her for Strauss. The Countess in Nozze di Figaro called upon the same reflective quality. In each recording the voice is forwardly placed compared to th orchestra, which is downright recessive in the Four Last Songs. Over the years I've found della Casa's interpretations placid, despite the voice's lovely feminine allure, and a later singger, Renee Fleming, outdoes her for hseer lustrousness and luxury of voice. But that doesn't take away from her unique status in the Fifties and Sixties.  Della Casa sang Ariadne on stage, but her voice can barely reach deep enough -- she tiptoes around the bottom notes of 'Es gibt ein Reich,' and throughut the aria the conducting is cautious and carefu, no doubt to help the singer.<br /><br />In almost all of these items Elisabeth Schwarzkopf is preferable for intrpretation and ultimate artistry. Della Casa surpasses her in Arabella, her most famous Strauss role, but then, Schwarzkopf only recorded short excerpts in mono under Ackermann, so we don't know how she would have fared in her maturity. In perspective I'd place della Casa on a high plane with Seefried and Gueden among her rough contemporaries and with Janowitz ten years later.utious and carefu, no doubt to help the singer.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is one of those rare movies that really should be seen (if you possibly can) during its theatrical release, especially the \\"3D\\" version of the film.  I'm not dissing the (at this writing) future DVD and Blue-Ray releases, but this is clearly a movie designed to completely immerse you in the world that James Cameron and his team have created.  You will miss some of that experience at home, even in many of the more sophisticated \\"Home Theater\\" setups that are out there.<br /><br />In addition to achieving many major technological breakthroughs in his quest to provide such an experience, Mr. Cameron has also devoted a great deal of effort to make the \\"World\\" of Pandora as realistic as possible.  This includes developing a whole biological encyclopedia of several thousand alien plant and animal species to populate the world, as well as investing in the development of a true spoken language for the Na'vi people, who are the natives of Pandora fighting to preserve their lives and culture in the face of human exploitation of their world.<br /><br />Many past \\"3D\\" films had two major flaws, the first being inadequate technology: resulting in a 3D experience that was clearly not quite true to life - with various artifacts such as blurring, double images or odd colors if you didn't have the 3D glasses on just right and your head oriented perfectly.  I experienced none of this in watching Avatar.  The \\"3D\\" imagery worked for me throughout the film without eye-wrenching distortions or artifacts.  Once the film started, I completely forgot about the special glasses, nor was there a need to hold my head \\"just so\\".<br /><br />The second common flaw in 3D films is that those who make them often fall into the trap of thinking that \\"3D\\" is so cool that their audience will enjoy having the integrity and flow of the film compromised just so they can experience some cool 3D effects, such as things jumping out of the screen at you.  While things certainly do \\"jump\\" in this film, I never once felt that a scene was staged with that as the primary goal.  Again, Cameron clearly stayed focused on the quality of our immersion within the world he had created: all the new technology he employed in making this film was a tool, not a toy.<br /><br />Now, on to the storyline itself...<br /><br />I was really impressed with Cameron's \\"turning the camera around\\" to show us how we might be seen by other (less technologically advanced) cultures who \\"get in the way\\" of our expansion.  This theme is one that has been played out in real life time and time again throughout the history of humanity.  I think that the lesson here is a valuable one; yet, it was done imaginatively and without being too heavy-handed or \\"preachy\\" as I feel that other recent films (such as [[ASIN:B000V7O0GW Happy Feet [HD DVD]]] have done.  To put it another way, the storyline is just as impressive and thoughtfully done as the visuals, and again the goal of producing a realistic and engaging experience that we can immerse ourselves in was pursued without allowing distractions to creep in and compromise the finished product.<br /><br />Finally, the themes in this film are so similar to Alan Dean Foster's book [[ASIN:0345350111 Midworld]] (published in 1975, and a book I highly recommend) that I would be very surprised if Cameron had not read Midworld at some point before he began work on Avatar.  There is no mention of this in the film's credits, though I have found some speculation about this on various blogs and newsgroups.  Though an interesting side note, this does not distract from the film's quality or impact.<br /><br />In summary, I will say something I have not said in any of my past reviews, which is that this is a superb film, and one you should see at least once in the Theatres, if not several times.  You should also consider getting a copy-of once it becomes available on Blue-Ray and DVD.  Avatar is definitely worth a rating of 5 Stars, enjoy!scene was staged with that as the primary goal.

If those reviews made you feel sick to the stomach, angry, patronized, or confused, this book is not for you. This is a book that was made for the coffee tables of higher-middle class, \\"artistically\\" inclined intellectuals for the sake of making themselves feel better. By writing this review, I'm actually helping them, because I'm just one more person who \\"doesn't get it,\\" because they, presumably, do.

It is better than [[ASIN:B00005JLZK Final Destination 2]], but that's my opinion. I enjoyed [[ASIN:B000FC2HS6 Final Destination 3 (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)]] the most. This one (the 4th) is probably my 2nd favorite, because it is really funny. I think the 3D is a pretty cool feature too. The (3D) DVD includes a special pair of 3D glass which are the standard paper kinds, but they are pretty cool looking. The movie is pretty good, cheesy, but what did you expect? It's a forth movie of a series.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is one extraordinary movie: story, script, cinematography and  stand out--memorable performance by Claire Danes.    The movie is captivating from beginning to end, provides a clear window into the unique personality  and remarkable accomplishments of this very special individual.  Purchase this video--you'll be singing it's  praises and no doubt wanting to share it with family and friends.
B001R7IHA0|2.0|First of all it must be said that I very much like what Keith is capable of and I have been WAY impressed by the warmth, color, personality and talent displayed in his LIVE acoustic performances. Keith is no doubt a very talented artist of massive (and realized!) potential. Further I am all for stylistic liberties being taken within the country or Americana genres but in what alternate universe is Keith Urban's over-slickly produced boy band caterwauling even remotely considered \\"country music?!\\"    I have really tried to like this formulaic and crassly commercial pablum for the masses but I simply cannot get past the WAY overblown production which to me thoroughly obfuscates and drowns all the character of Keith's actual musical personality, talent and heart.    I have seen Keith playing an acoustic guitar and singing live and it was compelling, inspirational, and downright good in a way that drew a person in to enjoy his great vocals - which totally work at the organic level. And therein lies the problem with Keith's recordings: They are so overtly faceless and pop that they could be any flavor of the month pop idol. Not a country star or singer-songwriter (which Keith really is) of any lastingly meaningful resonance.     There is absolutely NOTHING here that makes this stand out against the myriad masses of other over-produced, slick, radio fodder pop idols out there in corporate radio land. This is so slick it is just bland and gutless. BOR-ING!    Any true lover of real organic heartfelt natural music (which country is surely supposed to be on some level?!) would be hard pressed to sit through the insipid entirety of this \\"look how perfectly sterile and bloodless we can make this music sound\\" record.    I am really anxiously awaiting the day that Keith makes an acoustically-oriented finger picked less audaciously arranged and ostentatiously produced record where his personal style, the song, and actual quality of his voice are allowed to shine through and inhabit the center of focus.    Keith; the get rich quick commercial juggernaut formula scheme has worked. You no longer need the money nor the media spotlight platform to bring attention to your work. Please take a tip from the vintage recordings of artists such as Loggins and Messina, Dan Fogelberg, early Eagles, James Taylor, and Neil Young (who are no doubt MAJOR influences!), and get some life, heart, blood and breath into your future recordings.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|At least to me this is a super movie is for someone who like edge-of-your-seat action. The plot is:  guy's family is killed, now, what he going to to about it? The only let down part of the movie is it's end. I wanted him to just melt into the landscape. But that is not to be! In any case, see this movie!
B002RVZV9U|5.0|I went in special search of this film on blu-ray, you need it in this format in order to get the film without the audio compression, that DVD has. also, if you get this film turn it WAY UP! Jack White steals the show in this film, but Jimmy Page, and the Edge give a solid rock 'n roll history lesson for the ages! this film is one that if you have nothing to do on a Saturday afternoon pull it out and turn it up!
B002N1AERI|5.0|By far their best release ever.   Ambitious, HUGE, vast and very very good.   The musicality of these people has grown so much over the years, that they may in fact be the preeminent of their genre right now.  It is a classic European symphonic rock sound, with (and here is my small exception)...   they are still sticking to the cliche and boring \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" ie, an operatic female voice and a growling grunting male voice.   IMHO, this is simply a relic of the past and no longer necessary, and in some cases, severely cheapens the music.   It diminishes what they've done on this record in many ways.   The growl/grunt sounds work only 2% of the time, with the rest of the time they distract and sound just plain silly.   Not sure why so many Symph/Goth bands still stick to this vestige of anger past.  Other bands in this genre (Leaves Eyes as an example) ruin their sound just like this.       As an example, on the track \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\", it sounds like growler Mark Jansen is about to vomit several times.   In the midst of this grandiose and wonderfully bombastic composition, we get to hear Mark make noise that is akin to getting his throat smashed in the door of a school bus....   silly and outdated.  He is an excellent guitarist and composer, but he might want to spare us from his intestinal inflections in the future.       As far as the album goes, Simone Simons voice has matured so much in the past few years, I'm amazed its her that we hear on this recording.  She hits every note, and sounds big and bold.  I must admit that in the early days of Epica, I struggled with her voice.  There was potential then, and now we hear a grown up Simone taking the sound stage by storm.    The instrumentation on this recording is meticulous as usual.   There is the requisite double kick drumming, the orchestral accompaniments, the crunching guitar work, a fair amount of speed metal shredding.   All in all, great music.      I do like this album and it does warrant 4 1/2stars at least, with that half being removed because of the silly growling that didn't add anything to this record.  If you are fan of the genre, then this recording will not let you down.

The seller put an invoice in with the DVD saying that they wanted everyone 110%, but failed to put any contact info.

6304711905|4.0|Ordered this movie for a friend, whose son recommended it to her. It's great for fans of Westerns. Nicely filmed, appealing actors, and it had Charlton Heston who could have read the phone book and been great. Val Kilmer played his part winningly; Kurt Russell is always good in a movie, comedy, western, or whatever. This would never be a favorite of mine, though, as I am not a western fan especially. But for those who like this sort of plot, it seemed like one they would enjoy.
B00004TWZF|4.0|There are three versions of this movie out & I've seen them all. Each one left me with a different take on the show. Not bad considering it's basically the same story & with the same stars. The Director's cut 168 min's, the French release 132 min's & the American release 118 min's.<br /><br />It's a show done around the world free diving championships (meaning no air tanks but your lungs). I thought it would bore me but discovered that Jean Marc-Barr, Jean Reno & Rosanna Arquette (I like her) put together a fun, quirky & believable show. Marc-Barr plays Jacques Mayol who starts the show as a little French kid that likes to dive on the same island as Enzo played by Reno. Mayol's father is a sponge diver that dies picking sponges. It has an impact on young Jacques. Fast forward 15 - 20 years & Enzo is the worlds best free diver. He is not content however as his old competitor Jacques is not in sight.<br /><br />We find Jacques diving for the sake of science in the Andes Mountains. The scientific expedition has had an accident that requires the insurance company to send a rep down to investigate. That's Arquette's entrance as Johana Baker a quirky fun lady. She is immediately smitten with Jacques & that begins the rest of the show that revolves around the three of them & the dolphins Jacques admires. Jacques gets involved in Free diving because Enzo has him located & big Enzo who must be first in all things believes he will successfully romance Johana. The competition for Johana & the free diving world record begins. It plays much better than it reads with interesting looks at the world of diving as a sport, as a living, as fun & as science. The world of human relationships isn't left out. The love story is from as slightly unusual aspect due to Mayol's character.<br /><br />The American ending differs from the others but that didn't upset me. It wasn't that big a thing & I'm not big on the integrity of a storyline as I believe the rash of director cuts are more tied to ego than integrity. Their validity or necessity surely isn't much.<br /><br />The Directors cut I thought a travesty of time waste so many of its scenes really served no purpose. The French version was a much better length but I thought it suffered from having the same score as the Director's cut. Done by Eric Serra (the original composer) I felt the music was unrelated to the subject of the movie. The American version was cut a little short but had a new score done by Bill Conti. That score was perfectly suited to the water theme & as the music is a large part of your experience I prefer it by a bunch. The American ending is over dramatic but I'll put up with that for the change in music. I really like this show & when it comes to mind I always hear the American score not the original. Sometimes change is good as they say. I feel you should watch both the French & the American version. The Director's is just not good film.<br /><br />I give the Director' 2 1/2 Stars, the French 4 Stars & the American 5 Stars.<br />I'm rating all three versions together as 4 Stars.

0312360258|1.0|Oh look! A series about a teenager that has been specially marked and designated The Chosen One, with unknown cool powers who will someday save the world! What an original idea! In case my sarcasm isn't apparent, I wasn't exactly thrilled with this book (and it's unoriginality is the least of my criticisms). It comes up short in almost every category. Allow me to ennumerate:    - The characters were all one-dimensional and can be summed up in 1-2 words each. Her best friend Stevie Ray is a hick (a fact Zoey reminds us of by repeatedly describing her \\"Okie twang\\") and friendly. Her two other girlfriends are shallow and ....shallow. The only guy friend is smart and gay. Zoey's mentor is wise, and the antagonist (another student) is evil. Comically so. In fact, she utters lines like \\"This school is cool because I'm here. So stay out of my way\\" within the first 2 pages of meeting her. What?? Who even talks like that? Which leads me to my next point...    -The dialogue DOES NOT SOUND LIKE TEENAGERS. I may be mistaken, but I thought the job of the younger of the Cast authors was to make the teenagers sound like teenagers. SHE FAILED. MISERABLY. The conversations reminds one of grade-school kids, not high-schoolers. The writing in general was also sub-par.    - The monologues were a bit disconcerting and annoying. Yes, monologues. Zoey randomly goes off on monologues with herself about the dumbest thing, and she often does it in the middle of a conversation with somebody else. This happens at least once with everybody she talks to, and nobody finds it in the least bit odd.    -The plot was unpredictable insofar that I couldn't guess how Zoey would manifest her powers, but manifest them she would. Besides, we readers might not have taken the hint that Zoey is really cool and special, so the climax includes her using said powers to show just how much the vampire goddess (yes, you read that right) favors her.    - Oh ya, and the authors want you to know that discriminating against homosexual people is bad, but doing so against Christians is ok. The one Christian we meet is her step-dad, who is an egotistical, overbearing jerk. Ok, we get they aren't Jesus Freaks, but the Casts need to get out more if this is their view of every single Christian on the planet. Ironically enough, the vampires' view of the vampire goddess is very similar to that of Christians.    - I found all these elements annoying, but my main gripe with the book was its sheer...unrelatable-ness. I mean, what teenager can honestly relate to a 16 year old girl who is destined to be The Almighty Chosen One, has 3 gorgeous guys chasing after her, has \\"this is right feelings\\" about random things that do not fall under the conscience category (such as, I decided to take the long way to class today, and I JUST KNEW that it was the right thing to do), has 4 friends who are not really friends but more like starry-eyed adorers of her awesomeness, and who moralizes about everything from sex (girls who have sex in high school are losers!) to smoking (smokers are losers!) to goofing off in class (people who don't pay attention in class are losers!). I actually agree with these ideas, but the manner in which the authors presented them could have been handled more tactfully (i.e. I would have appreciated NOT being beat over the head with them)
0061703257|5.0|I bought this book based on the short movie trailers seen as of late. I am a fan of suspense/thriller/mystery type stories and after reading the blurb I figured this would be a great book. I was correct! I read the book in just 2 days simply due to the fact that it was hard to put down. Each chapter seemingly brings you closer to the answers you CAN'T wait to find out! However, with an answered question comes new questions. The story is generally easy to follow and the vivid detail the author spends time to develop really immerses the reader in this \\"island\\" with all it's mysteries. The character dialogue is strong, there isn't much wasted space or time in the story, it moves fairly quickly. If you are someone who enjoys this type of book you can't go wrong for the price. Enjoy!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|I ordered this musical for my 16 yr old daughter.  She is performing in her high school production of cats.  The school recommended the cast members rent the musical so they can practice.  I decided to buy it for my daughter so that the whole family could watch it and then we would have an idea of what to expect from her production.  I throughly enjoyed the musical, my favorite character was Rum Tum Tiger, the actor was superb.  My daughter watches it all the time.

The Punishment Due\\" and \\"Enter Sandman\\" (the first tracks on these two discs), there was no turning back for me.<br /><br />With the whole 20th anniversary press around this album, such as the Rust In Peace tour in March 2010 (where Megadeth will be playing the whole CD), along with the release of the entire CD as downloadable content on the video game Rock Band (if you're a 30 year old kid like me, this was a real treat, haha) -- I figured what better time to pay homage and go back to my roots by finally getting the remastered version (yeah, I know, a little late... I mistakenly assumed the quality wasn't much better than the original and passed it up for several years). I actually originally got this one on tape way back then (I know... what's that?)<br /><br />Anyway, not expecting too much, I was pleasantly surprised by this remaster. It is actually a remaster that makes the CD sound MUCH better! (As opposed to a lot of these \\"remasters\\" of other discs that sound just as muddy and dull as the original). First, the bass is a lot more prevalent and punchy in this version. I felt it was a bit downplayed in the original mix, but this one does it justice, as I am a fan of Ellefson anyways (who recently rejoined the band if you haven't heard). The guitars are cleaner and more crisp sounding. This is the Rust In Peace that you were originally meant to hear -- clean, crisp, punchy... it's worth it to get this one again if you only own the original or even have never owned this CD at all.<br /><br />Others have mentioned, so I won't rehash too much... the word is that the original vocal tracks were \\"lost\\" for several of the tracks, including \\"Take No Prisoners\\", \\"Five Magics\\", and \\"Lucretia\\". The vocals for \\"Take No Prisoners\\" had to be fully re-recorded from scratch, and alternate takes had to be used for the others. This will probably throw off those who know the album very well (example: the backing vocals for \\"Take No Prisoners\\", i.e. \\"... infiltrate them ... terminate them...\\" sound distinctly different from the original), but the new vocals are not so jarring that it ruins the CD... in fact, after listening to this version a few times over, you'll start to get used to the new ones and will hardly even notice after a while.<br /><br />Overall, I have to give this CD and the remastering quality five stars, simply because I can listen to this CD and get just as into it now as I could 20 years ago when it first came out. So many great, classic songs on this one. When I can still listen to a CD 20 years later, and it is still just as musically relevant and fun to listen to as anything out today (if not more so), then it's a keeper. Tag onto that the vast improvement in the audio quality due to the remastering, and the additional bonus tracks, and it's a no-brainer -- Do yourself a favor, especially if you've never really given this CD a solid listen -- GET IT. It's worth every penny.akes had to be used for the others.

1401323820|5.0|As an adjunct to the ABC comedy crime drama \\"Castle,\\" \\"Heat Wave\\" hits the mark as the creative work of Richard Castle. Fans of the show will recognize his wit and humor in the prose as well as the inclusion of his experiences with the NYPD and Detective Kate Beckett into the story. The characters and their relationships are perfect mirrors to those that Richard Castle experiences with his ride-along at twelfth precinct while makes it an easy transition for fans of the show. ABC has gone to greater lengths than any network I've ever seen to provide their fans with something interactive that directly ties into the show. Far beyond \\"breaking the fourth wall,\\" this book pushes the limit of the artistic world meeting the \\"real world.\\" Fans will feel like they are sharing the experience with their favorite characters from \\"Castle\\" by laying their hands on Richard Castle's first Nikki Heat novel.       As a work of literature, \\"Heat Wave\\" is a sensational success. The story is written with an appropriate tone and just the right balance of wit and accuracy. The information pertaining to the case is appropriately crisp and matter-of-fact while the relationships and interactions between people are genuine and human. The characters are well-developed without being too overbearing or distracting from the woven crime cases. Even a character like Jameson Rook, who is exasperating and arrogant on the best of days, is given just the right amount of human qualities to endear him to the audience. The reader will care about the characters and read eagerly for the solution to the crime.
0393075966|4.0|Joseph Stiglitz is a good professor. He gently leads amateurs such as myself into the abstract world of Wall Street financial transactions considerately, remembering not all of us reading his book may be well acquainted with that world.    And what an odd world Wall Street is since it is not founded upon any reality. The only reality, in that world, being earnings, higher profits, and generous bonuses.    Stiglitz constantly reminds us (and in our deeply capitalist culture we may perhaps need reminding) that high finance should serve a broad and basic social utility. That the activities these bankers and financiers engage in should also provide some benefits to society beside serving as clever means to quickly enrich themselves. And that it was this latter emphasis that led to the melt down.    A fine accompaniment to Stiglitz's book would be Nomi Prins', It Takes a Pillage. She too reminds herself that her reader may not be intimate with Wall Street, though she approaches her topic as an insider, Wall Street jargon often popping up. And her anger sizzles through as she makes a desperate appeal for a return of Glass Steagall. The story she relates is similar to Stiglitz's (after all, they're dealing with the same reality) and contends much of the blame falls on deregulation.    Both authors tell us that without proper regulation there will be more bubbles and more bail outs. Though considering how entrenched the capitalist orthodoxy is in this country reregulating may not be easy.
B000063V8T|4.0|Season 5 of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" contains many predictable elements. Big surprise, the Enterprise encounters new aliens that test the crew's versatility and quick thinking as well as meeting old foes, like the Crystalline Entity and the Borg, who make them debate good and evil, right and wrong. Season 5 includes time travel, body possession, and transporter malfunctions. For a little titillation, the audience can count on Cmdr. Riker (Jonathan Frakes) seducing any pretty young thing in sight.<br /><br />So why aren't we bored? How does \\"STNG\\" still manage to fire up our imaginations? Season 5 captivates its audience with a foolproof formula: It introduces a neophyte who, because of limited experience, thinks like the audience who are just as ignorant. Situations and veteran characters then guide the neophyte to understand issues and responsibilities in fuller, deeper ways, schooling us in the process.<br /><br />The first four seasons, we had young Wesley Crusher (Wil Wheaton) as our stand-in. For Season 5, the writers introduce Ensign Ro Laren (Michelle Forbes), a Bajoran with Starfleet experience but no familiarity with the professionalism and community that characterize the Enterprise. Ensign Ro does more than give the audience a new neophyte to learn from; she appeals to a different variety of geek.<br /><br />Geeks fall somewhere on this continuum: At one extreme point are the folks who desire idealized social conformity. They yearn to participate in a cool group--just not the imperfect cliques at school or work. They want a community without pettiness, bullying, and other human flaws. Folks at this extreme want to be members of the near-utopian Enterprise, and they identify with Wesley because they would love the opportunity to come up in the culture as he has. At the other extreme of the geek continuum are the rebels. They ridicule Wesley for his desire to please and hope to identify with the misunderstood aliens the Enterprise is bound to meet. These folks embrace Ensign Ro, whom Big Daddy Picard (Patrick Stewart) rewards with attention despite her being standoffish, disobedient, and untamable.<br /><br />To explain her atypical behavior, the writers give Ensign Ro this back story: She and her race lost their home planet to the Cardassians. Orphaned and living in refugee camps, Ro grew up feeling discarded and so is herself quick to reject. She abandons her own people to join Starfleet but then disobeys orders with disastrous results, including the forfeit of her commission and personal freedom. Ro boards the Enterprise with a sullen attitude and non-regulation Bajoran earring, happy to throw away a good first impression on Cmdr. Riker. When in 10-Forward Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) and Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) ask if she would mind their company at her table, she answers simply, \\"Yes,\\" dismissing their offer of friendship.<br /><br />Forbes does an excellent job communicating the coltish energy of an exasperated teenager. Although her character never utters the word, we hear a \\"Whatever!\\" in the way she throws her body around. We soon forget that Ensign Ro is a Starfleet officer as Forbes has Ro assume sloppy, defensive posture, barely able to contain her contempt for the old farts who just can't appreciate her radical ideas and maverick methods. Whenever Ro knits her brow, either to signify anger or perplexity, those signature eyebrows emphasize the emotion.<br /><br />Ensign Ro obviously has lessons to learn, and since we have all had occasion to feel that we will never fit in or do things right, we get schooled along with her. In \\"Disaster,\\" for example, Counselor Troi finds herself in charge of a ship about to explode. Ro recommends abandoning the drive section despite the survivors it might contain. Troi refuses to separate the saucer, a successful maneuver that teaches Ro that an officer should not so callously abandon her crew.<br /><br />In \\"Power Play,\\" however, Capt. Picard demonstrates when an officer must sacrifice life. The Enterprise encounters penal colony escapees who board the ship in the bodies of Counselor Troi, Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney), and Lt. Cmdr. Data (Brent Spiner). Picard tricks them into a cargo bay where he can blow the hatch, sacrificing himself and the other officers but taking the prisoners with him and thus saving everyone else on the ship.<br /><br />In \\"The Next Phase,\\" Ensign Ro awakens on the Enterprise after a transporter accident. Since no one can see her, she believes she is dead, a suspicion confirmed when she discovers Dr. Crusher filling out her death certificate. Lt. Cmdr. La Forge (LeVar Burton), cloaked in the same manner, convinces her not to abandon her place among the living so quickly, that another explanation besides death might account for their predicament. Working together, they find a solution to their invisibility rather than haunt the ship as ghosts.<br /><br />What Season 5 needed was one more episode to show whether Ensign Ro grew as a result of her experiences on the Enterprise. The writers should have put her in a situation similar to the disastrous away mission from the Wellington when her disobeying orders caused the deaths of eight crew members. With flashbacks or another storytelling device, the writers could have given the audience the opportunity to learn the events of that day and make up its own mind whether Ro behaved poorly or not. The Enterprise crew knows the story; it's unfair that we don't. Was her decision a calculated loss of life? Would by-the-book have definitely failed? Was the captain of the Wellington an ineffectual leader prone to giving bad orders? A drunk? The paralleling new situation would have allowed us to observe what Ro had since learned.<br /><br />If the Enterprise resembles a plastic surgeon's office with its calm pastels, uncluttered surfaces, and recessed lighting, the characters often seem victims of the doctor's knife, sliced a little too tight, as with Ensign Ro. Or perhaps the real characters of the series are the controversial issues each episode addresses, the crew just flat pieces, like plastic checkers, pushed around as the two sides face off.ters penal colony escapees who board the ship in the bodies of Counselor Troi, Chief O'Brien (Colm Meaney), and Lt.

B0001O3YEE|5.0|The space transport vessel \\"Hunter-Gratzner\\" carrying 40 people on-board crashes on a desert planet when the ship is struck in a meteor storm. There are only 10 survivors, among them are pilot Carolyn Fry, who has assumed command after the ship's captain is killed, bounty hunter William J. Johns, religious man Abu \\"Imam\\" al-Walid, Antiques dealer Paris P. Ogilvie, runaway teenage girl Jack, settlers John 'Zeke' Ezekiel and his lover Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery and Richard B. Riddick, a dangerous escaped convict. Marooned, the 10 survivors finds the barren and hot desert-scape has sunlight from three suns. Not only they find food and water, and worry about Riddick, the survivors finds themselves being hunted by the planet's flesh eating alien inhabits, when the planet is engulfed in darkness, which happens every 22 years, as they come out on to the surface to hunt and eat all signs of life. Fry and the survivors finds Riddick is their best chance of survival, as Riddick has surgically-enhanced silver eyes that allow him to see in the dark as they set out to find a way of escaping from the planet and getting to a escape shuttle, before they all get eaten by the creatures on the surface. It's a great movie because it uses Science Fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provoking story, rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of Science Fiction. Interesting and entertaining with a great cast, and great special effects.
