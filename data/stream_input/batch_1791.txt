B009WUBERW|5.0|this was action packed top stars in this it had parts you couldnt help but giggle about .I loved the first movie & this one is just as good as !! well worth adding to my collection .
B004LWZW4W|3.0|I was not very impressed with this movie. I feel it was ok and would not have bought it for my library had I seen it before.
B005FITIGO|4.0|I found this film powerful and totally engrossing.  I do not how accurately it portrays what happen t during the 2008 financial meltdown, but the film has prompted me to find out.  I will find a good book on the subject or as recommended by another reviewer watch Frontline's \\"Money, Power and Wall Street.\\"<br /><br />The performances were excellent, particularly Jeromy Irons.<br /><br />My only complaint about the movie was its excessive us of profanity, particularly the f-work.  I NEVER hear that word used by any of my friends or family, so I object to being 'entertained' by its constant presence.  Perhaps the screenwriter felt it was necessary to show the crudeness of Wall Street personal, but he could have found a better way to demonstrate this.<br /><br />I recommend this thought provoking film.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I absolutely love this album.  It is a great traditional album that keeps from being boring by the guest performers.  Rod's neo jazzy style is really rocking the Christmas songs this season.  I am so glad he did this album.  Merry Christmas All.
B003EVWDR0|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ! the story the colors the animals the floating mountains and love for their planet . The imagination for all of it !!!!! Cant wait for the next one
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I really liked the mix of the old west with and the alien(are we really alone) question. Very well done!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I would have given it more stars if I could have.  I read 30 to 40 books a year and I can't remember enjoying a book more than this one.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|love the game and the characters, just wish everything did not cost so much.<br />no doubt going to watch the movie asi loves these characters and it is hard to pick a fav.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|i love super heros and this one has managed to tie into its previous movies a continue to drop hints for the next one ! I cant wait
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I really enjoyed how this movie was filmed! It really took you back in time and I enjoyed it from beginning to end! Shia LeBeouf was great in this movie!
0141335734|5.0|This book completes the series for my Grandson.  He doesn't know the book will be under his Christmas tree and I know he will be delighted with this edition to complete his set.  The package was well wrapped and arrived timely.  The book is in excellent condition and will make one 10 year old very happy when he joins his \\"hero\\" on the upcoming adventures of The Son of Neptune by Rick Riordan.  Many thanks for a job well done.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|As always, Nicholas Sparks offers another good read. I can't wait to see the movie. Very awesome book. Thank you!
B0096HIEE2|5.0|This is great someone made a movie where GUYS take it off and dance !! Yes all women need to watch this then jump there mans bones !! love it
B0087HT36U|5.0|Great for the airport , when you don't have any work. Other than that, its just ok.  Its pretty adictive once you start.
0345803485|1.0|This book is so repetitious its painful to read and boring.  Very immature author who really can't write all that well.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and went on to purchase the entire series. Fun ans fast paced it was written well but still had a realistic fantasy storyline
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|this is great i cant help but giggle  and laugh out loud when i am playing this game and its loads f fun
B007VUA7VO|3.0|As I have not been able to find the AP yet, I really cannot review it...but did not want to slam something I have not seen or utilized, therefore, three stars.  I am sure it is on my Kindle Fire HD, but have not yet figured out where or how to look for it.  Someday......  Realize I am 73 years old and probably just a dinasaur (sp?) but really enjoy the Skype, it allows me to talk and see my grandchildren and children.  Wish they lived closer...they could probably teach me all I need to know!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is a wonderful book and gives an insight into what would happen if you had dimentia, very insightful, I was sorry when I finished it.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Read the entire series - it is well written and envelopes you into a story within a story. I can't wait to read all the books in the series
1611761069|1.0|I am done with this author.  I am sick of her one dimensional characters contantly carping with each other, repeating tnemselves, banalities abound, so much unnecessary filler. And like all her books, when you finally find out who the villian is, you couldn't care less...he has never been developed as a character, he is just revealed out of the blue when she can't think of any more boring chapters to add.  Her first book was a winner, but her formula has been used to death and her characters are unpleasant to a fault.  Enough of them and of Cornwell.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a clever little dice game.  We've had a set for more than a year and as a family we probably bust it out after dinner at least a couple of times a month.  I like these sorts of press-your-luck dice games, although I wish there were some mechanic (ala Cosmic Wimpout) that would *require* you to go further despite your desire to stand pat.  Our son is almost nine and we've bought a few extra sets to keep in the closet for the last minute birthday party gift.  Anyway, well worth the $13.
0141439831|5.0|I haven't read it yet but I ordered it to have because I know the story and havde ready it before,,,
B0068THAGY|1.0|Oh come on besides some cool special effects, just how many times have we seen this movie before? It really did not grab my attention at all
B00ADYYY50|3.0|Wiz,<br /><br />I've been waiting for this album to drop for a while now and so has your other fans.<br />What happened to your lyrical talent from those days of the 'Pittsburgh sound' man?<br />You're not hungry anymore and I can hear it. All you do now is rap about the same stuff and it gets old.<br />While I listen to your tracks, I can picture you faded and just 'reading' off your iPhone over a bomb beat.<br />Honestly, the beats went to waste over redundant topics and awkward delivery. What happened to you?<br />Where's the 'Prince of City' and 'Kush & OJ Wiz'? I want 'Mesmorized', 'This Plane', 'Never Been' back.<br />Put the paper planes down for a second and think about it. You're just bragging about your fan's money<br />to your fans because it's your fans that have supported you, bought your albums, and concert tickets.<br />I want to hear you speak about real stuff that'll motivate your fans to be successful like you,<br />especially in hard economic times. The majority of your fans are young and get paid hourly; we<br />wake up, get dressed, play your tracks in our hoopties, and drive to work - the last thing we want to<br />hear is somebody talking about how much money he has. I mean regular folks just living by, we<br />are not even on your level to be hating - we are proud of you - but man, motivate us. Seriously,<br />who are you rapping to? Other rappers or your fans? If you are rapping to your fans, you're just<br />crapping on us.<br /><br />Yours truly,<br /><br />#1 Fan Stan
B0063GORYU|3.0|I found some of the controls like undo and new game to be difficult to get to. Other than that, it is fun for the most part
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I can play the game along w/my 3 yr old.  Easy to download and just plain out fun plus no vulgar language involved.
0141036257|5.0|I like very much every Malcom Gladwell's book. He knows how comunication works. And he konws how to show us!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Grandaughter has the movie but wanted to watch it at gandma's house. When they watch a movie over and over it has to be good to keep theri interest.
1936608618|5.0|I very much love this book. It is very methodical and detailed. It goes over everything I need to know about.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Very stable and easy to use. Works on all my devices,  office computer, laptop, iphone, kindle fire and it's free what's not to like.
B000FC10MU|5.0|If you have one iota of interest in reading American Gods, stop thinking and click \\"buy\\".  Gaiman has shown the type of world crafting he is capable of with previous works like Stardust and Neverwhere.  In American Gods, Gaiman mixes a hodgepodge of pre-existing material like Americana and ancient mythology to create the framework for one of the most entertaining and original novels I've ever read.  I am an unabashed Neil Gaiman fan, but this book absolutely blew my mind.  Gaiman uses this book to scour his imagination for the most interesting ways to showcase gods, creatures and ghouls from every corner of the ancient (and not so ancient) world in conflict with the new \\"gods\\" of today.  If you've ever wondered where all the gods of old have gone, and who stands in their place, this is the book for you.  Cheers
B004FRX0MY|4.0|I really like this Cloud Player even more than iTunes!  It is easy and so fast & I have my downloads on my device in a flash! I am happy in VA!
0399224459|5.0|My son (almost 3) loves this book.  I have been reading it for at least a year.  I almost never tell the story the same way twice and that is what I love about the book - the author allows the parent to tell a story and doesn't force a rote recitation of scripted lines.  I make up dialog and motivations for the characters, sometimes we focus on the colors of bars and keys, sometimes we compare sizes of the animal versus the mini-stuffed animal version in each cage, sometimes we go and knock on every neighbor's door and have surprise reactions to the sight of all the animals walking across the lawn.  This book can be read a million different ways and I honestly have a lot of fun with this book and my son still asks for a new reading of \\"Gorilla\\" every night.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever.Great story,good acting it occupies my kids every time it is on.They can't get enough of it and neither can I
B000JQU4TW|3.0|Overall Dorian Gray is a good jaunt.  Some people have called the book crude but, considering the content, perhaps crude is the best way to present this book.  You are supposed to hate most of the characters.  Besides the artist, most characters are the very definition of Fench Decadance and some even get their just rewards.  This is a free book so just buy it and enjoy the short story about what happens when vanity runs rampant.  Cheers
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This does the job for a Kindle. FIts well and does a good job protecting the device. I'd recommend it for the price.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|As usual, this season is awesome!!!!  This series is one of the few that never gets boring or repetitive. I look forward to it every week.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I have yet to try the dvd's but they look pristine.<br />Buying used BluRays seems a lot more economical than new
B007HACDLK|4.0|gets right to the action, typical mitch rapp story with a twist here and there.  fans will like it, will make a good gift
0790732254|5.0|I have never seen the play performed, and am not sure if it has the some power, but this quaint film packs a punch. The performances are exceptional. Taylor may have won the oscar, but Burton owns this film. His potent reserve and scorching wit somehow makes for a sympathetic character. Since my eyes never left the screen, I was so emotionally invested in the plot, and the ending was tragic (in the modern sense) I see this wonder from the sixties as an epic. Please don't miss it. *Snap*
B009FZHYKU|5.0|great characters, action scense and of course, plenty of gore. The main reason I watch is the character interactions, one of the best shows ever!
B006L9B6TI|5.0|For anyone wanting to change their life, not knowing how to do it!  It does work and can change your thinking on lots of areas for the rest of your life.  Read with respect and acceptance that you can change your destiny!
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|I am currently reading this book and loving it.  It fills in all the details that are missing in the movie. I love Jane Austen's style of writing and it amazes me how long ago she wrote this book.
B00007GZR5|5.0|This is not a religiously based movie even though it portrays  life/death, reincarnation, heaven/hell, and it does make mention of God. Mostly, it's a story of LOVE.<br />ROBIN WILLIAMS is absolutely BRILLIANT in this role. His performance is STELLAR. It is too bad he did not have more opportunity outside of comedy, because he is a VERY, VERY GOOD actor (versatile and intuitive). CUBA GOODING JR.(I think he is a great actor equally capable in drama/melodrama and comedy) is REALLY, REALLY GOOD in his role, as well (he has not appeared in movies nearly as often as he should have). ANNABELLA SCIORRA deftly holds her own with a performance that STUNNINGLY equals her costars performances. ENORMOUS PERFORMANCES by everyone in the movie. BREATHTAKING ACTING.<br />The movie is slow. It did not bother me (especially considering the exceptional acting, the EXQUISITE visuals, and the AMAZING SPECIAL EFFECTS (especially the depiction of HELL--off the chart GOOD). BUT others may find the pace annoying.<br />I read some of the other reviews and was saddened by some of the reviewers who let their religion get in the way of understanding THIS IS A MOVIE and THEREFORE A FANTASY. SO WHAT'S NEW THERE????<br />I do recommend this movie, but sparingly. It's not for everyone. I will share it selectively. The combination of the FANTASTIC special effects, BEAUTIFUL visuals, and, of course, the acting, the WONDERFUL performances, make this movie a real EXPERIENCE.<br />LIFE, AFTERLIFE, DEATH, REBIRTH, GUILT, DAMNATION, REDEMPTION, and LOVE----ALL IN YOUR OWN MIND.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Nice album of older Broadway songs. One with Michael Crawford and two with Donnie Osmond. Susan is in wonderful voice. I wish she would put out a new song of her own.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read this book based on curiosity after the huge amount of press it's gotten recently. The plot is thin, the characters are not very well developed, and the writing itself is lackluster. I got tired of the &#34;Oh my&#34; every third sentence. The main character's constant laments about her predicament and insecurity about Mr. Grey was annoying.  There was also some discontinuity in the story...I guess the only reason this book is so popular is the explicit storyline. The writing was weak at best. I think the author could use some writing classes.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|Pretty good game. not that many levels but it is pretty challenging. I would recommend for anyone trying to kill time.
B001JRB16U|5.0|This DVD is so wonderful.Best of the Best of Disney's Musicals.Bought for my grandchild as I already own this and not willing to part with it as it symbolizes the quality of what is so Fantasticexpeeodicios about it . I can't wait to see her face when she opens her present for Channukah.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Absolutely wonderful series. Love owning it myself. Can watch and rewatch.  Can't wait for the next episodes to come out on DVD.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching this show each week. It is very different from what I expected, but still very good.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Ordered this movie and was shipped fast as expected! Great movie and packaging was good also. Would definitely buy movies here again
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very well written, with great character developement.  The book provides an interesting look at history, it made you feel a part of the events.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|Installed on Kindle--Completely worthless--I would fill in the town I wanted to view and it would go back to Los Angeles (pre-loaded).  Over several days I tried over and over, as did my husband. Finally I downloaded a free version of weatherbug and it works perfectly! I deleted this one completely from my device.
0525952926|3.0|Winter of the World makes for fast reading.  The period it covers from 1933 to 1949 is of course one of turmoil and the characters are caught in it to various degrees.  I could hardly set the book down and read it ravenously.  However there is one thing that bothered me to some extent: those highly improbable coincidences throughout the book.  There are too many to be quoted here and that seems unfortunate to me.  In that regard Fall of Giants had a better plot and, though it flowed much more slowly than Winter, seemed more believable.  Winter nevertheless makes for great reading: it is action-packed, the characters come alive with some standing out (notably Carla von Urlich and Lloyd Williams)...  Can hardly wait for Volume III, hoping Mr Follett will keep away from those all to many \\"fortuitous\\" encounters.
0446572993|3.0|This is not one of Baldacci's best works.  There are a few twists and turns, but the story moves along with predictable scenes and characters.  Only at the very end of the book does it gain momentum and attract the reader's attention.
1451695195|5.0|And, the reason it is so amazing, it is unlike any other NDE experience that you have ever read before.  The fact that the Scientist/Doctor who experienced this event is the most amazing.  I read it twice on my Kindle and then purchased books for gifts, also.  The first time i read it was for the experience information.  The 2nd time was for the  science part.  I just would like to know, is this man, Eben Alexander still operationg on other's brains?<br />The surprise at the end was quite lovely, also so do order and enjoy this book!
B007SSEBCU|3.0|Margaret Thatcher is one of my personal favorite women in history. I dont' think this movie did her justice. However, Meryl Streep was amazing. I just thought there should be more to the story.
B00979CS50|2.0|I've listened to this album all the way through twice now and, I will have to admit, \\"Driftin' Back\\" holds up even with the 27:39 running time.  I thinks he's hit gold with this one song and I haven't thought that about a Neil Young track in a very long time.<br /><br />I don't think the album is all that bad (especially \\"Driftin' Back\\") but the overall concept is lazy. The extended jams might be welcome in a live setting (especially with Young playing off the likes of Stephen Stills) but it seems pointless with a band as mediocre as Crazy Horse. I've wanted to like EVERY Neil Young album since \\"Harvest Moon\\" but he's made it impossible with his sloppy playing and lousy songs. There is always a bit of brilliance here and there but no coherent, consistent statement since \\"Harvest Moon\\". Case in point? \\"Change Your Mind\\" from \\"Sleeps with Angels\\". A 3 to 5 minute version might have been a classic. At 14 minutes and 39 seconds, the song is a repetive, crashing bore. Too bad. The endless feedback on \\"Ragged Glory\\" detracts rather than enhances a potentially decent effort. Is he screwing with us or does he really think these experiments work? Who knows? Probably not even him!<br /><br />Despite the frequent missteps, I'm glad he's still out there. He is truly a wonder to behold in concert....that, happily, hasn't changed in the course of his very long career.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved reading this book, wrapped up the series very well I thought.  Twists and turns around every corner kept the action and mystery coming.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i have been waiting soo long for this game to come out on my kindle. in my opinion its an awsome game to play and it can be adicting trust me u should at least try this game . well long story short just get the game  :D
B009KHBDUU|3.0|If you go with it as a movie and not remember the series. It was ok. But if you remember the original series, well it lacks alot.
B00A992NDO|5.0|The whole album is awesome not just a couple of songs. Her style has changed a bit from the first CD. The meaning of each song varies from the party song to serious relationship problems. Awesome album to enjoy.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|An amazing movie, a great ending to the best super hero movie trilogy of all time. Tom Hardy is an amazing Bane and Christian Bale (as always) a perfect Batman.
B00A2IUDO8|4.0|This movie is halarious! I thought that this movie would just be your run of the mill stupid comedy but this was actually pretty good. Please, please don't let your kids watch it though.
0141040378|5.0|This review is more for the hardcover book design then the actual story within. That being said, Sense and sensibility is a wonderful novel. Moving on, the design of this book is lovely. It is well made and very pretty. I will definitely be buying a few more of these, because I think they would look great all together on the shelf.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|The book is a fun easy read. I found myself laughing out loud to many honest confessions and lessons throughout the book. The book is well written and organized. A refreshing read that wasn't too serious. Very enjoyable.
B0041KKYGU|4.0|This movie is hilarious! Warning: if you don't like raunchy comedy, don't watch this. If you like American Pie, Super Bad, Scary Movie 1-4 you need to see this. A great addition to your library.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferriss packs this book full of ideas.  It isn't just about cooking, but right out of the gate when I turned on the Kindle and my pre-order arrived on the date expected, I found 2 recipes I had to try.  I have watched a lot of cooking shows and the stuff on gels was so new to me.  I just like everything about Tim's series on 4-hour stuff.  It is dynamic, energetic, and motivating.
B009LRE040|5.0|People need to review this without DK in mind. DK gave this movie extremely high expectations.<br /><br />Did it surpass these expectations?<br /><br />NO<br /><br />Is it still a great movie?<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY<br /><br />This is by far the best movie of 2012. Much better than Avengers. It is also better than Batman Begins. This movie is really, really good.<br /><br />Tom Hardy is amazing as Bane.<br /><br />I wish there was more Alfred. If you watch the movie, you'll see where he goes.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway was surprisingly good as cat woman.<br /><br />You should go watch this movie RIGHT NOW!<br /><br />\\"RISE\\"
1577314808|5.0|Just started read this and i love it! the book was in perfect condition! hah loved it! a must read!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. So many twists and turns. Ending can't discuss, but want to. Definitely keeps you involved!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I use this product daily.  I have it for my Kindle and my Android.  I even use it to set reminders.  It is my best friend in the grocery store and the only list I make now.
B004SIIBGU|2.0|Its not really worth the space it takes up. The mobile site is easier to use. I reccomend using the website instead.
B000FA675C|4.0|This is the book that gave fodder to Pawns of Prophecy and countless other knockoffs. i read this before seeing the movie and was impressed with the vivid descriptions and fast paced action scenes. 4 stars just because of all the hype surrounding it- you can never live up to the hype. A very entertaining novel still- not great but not a moment of regret for reading either.
B0017O1MIM|2.0|There is one ugly idea that permeates this movie; The Magical Caucasian leads the stupid, primitive Arabs. It's a distasteful, racist undercurrent that reflects the early '60s American thought structure. It doesn't matter how great the acting, cinematography, etc. are, any great movie's story HAS to be mature and convey a breakout from this kind of backward relationship.
B00846REIS|5.0|The pages are just flying by it took just a couple of days to finish. She has to hurry to write a new one
B009AP4MGE|5.0|Great love this season! Bring on the new guys! I'm in love with Marley! Go Marley and Jake💚 great songs and voices
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So you like the hunger games? Welcome to the club. So now that you are cool, do what the cool kids are doing and kindle the hunger games. But wait, that costs money! Cool kids spend their money wisely; get this trilogy and you get all 3 books (yep you knew that a trilogy means 3 because you ROCK) for less than buying them all separate. Sure you could borrow them for free from the kindle store or the library but then you couldn't quote directly from the Gospel of Katniss about the evils of Beelzebub Snow all willy nilly like could you?
B00005JNS0|4.0|I can watch this with my child or by myself over and over again we even have the cars to the movie
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are great, light weight and don´t move at all while am running, definetly comparable to other headphones that are more expensive
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Creepy , sexy , strange, and a little warped. that about sums it up.. not something I would watch with my 15 yr old. But a great story lots of heart pumping scenes. if you like to get a little feaked out with some intense sexy scenes then this is a MUST!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This game on the mac in the 80's was great. This version unfortunately contracted  dysentery and suffered from low entertainment shortages. Just another example that you can never go back home.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|i liked it it has a good suspensense and can watch it later so it would be bfresh again a
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Angry Birds is a challenging, fun game.  It is a game I can enjoy playing by myself and I can see the progress I am making when I advance to the next level.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Received this yesterday from Amazon.  My comments follow:<br /><br />The 5.1 Master Audio soundtrack is reference quality.  The movie had a tremendous sound design and the reproduction on the blu-ray is nearly perfect....music, sound effects, and dialogue are mixed very well.  Hans Zimmer's score is pretty darned good.<br /><br />Just like The Dark Knight some scenes are shown in IMAX format and others in 35mm...............this does not bother me except it makes me wish the whole movie was in IMAX format...........the IMAX scenes are MUCH clearer and sharper.................the 35 mm portions of the movie for the most part are softer and very if not too dark.<br /><br />I really liked the Dark Knight Rises though I think the first 2 movies were better...................TDKR has a lot doing for it in particular the parts with Catwoman..............Miss Hathaway makes a VERY sexy and appealing femme fatale and her scenes are the outstanding parts of the film.<br /><br />Nolan ended this movie very well, and even though the movie is long, he had me wanting more............a lot more!  Overall a good end to a very ambitious and well made trilogy.
B003G94BZC|4.0|I am too used to the old doctor and it will take time for me to get used to Matt Smith. The overall story was good though.
B000FTWB7G|4.0|I love how the music is very diffrent then most and the singer on here her voice is amazing. would listen to this alot
B001BANK32|4.0|It had been a number of years since I read this and I loved it again this time.  I never feel like Stephen King knows how to end a novel, but the rest of it is classic King gold.  Good creepiness throughout with some moments of true terror.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|A present for a movie buff who will be blown away. The extras will make it worth the time to watch.
B004S5C8WG|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a great story teller and this is one of his best. Loved it all the way to the end.
B000F8O35U|4.0|this is a classic that the whole family can watch and enjoy i could watch this one over and over
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Like a lot of people in these reviews, I really like the first 3/4 or so, when whatever &#34;it&#34; is wasn't defined.  Like most scary stories, once you know what &#34;it&#34; is, it's a letdown.  I recommend with the caveat that you'll like be disappointed in the last bit, but the majority is quite creepy.
B009AP2G26|3.0|Season 4 isn't starting out so hot! They aren't giving the new cast a chance by constantly bringing the old cast back every episode & in some of the most unbelievable, illogical ways. Not that Glee has even been known for being believable! But they are going too far. It's ok to keep up with the old cast, but quick bringing them back to Lima at every turn. Let the new cast have their chance to shine & build the story around them now. The story is just getting ridiculous now. I mainly watch for the music, but even the music choices this season aren't anything to write home about. Glee better get it's game together, or I won't be watching much longer. Stick with seasons 1-3...season 4 needs major help!
B000SEI230|5.0|was not the book I thought was buying but was excellent in every way. Every well written and an excellent story.  I would recommend it to anyone that likes love stories from real life. A perfect story
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This is the best show ever. The acting is perfect. The scrips are so well written I watch an episode and re-watch it so as to get every single plot twist. I'm looking forward to &#34;The Hobbit&#34; even more because these two actors star in it. Martin Freeman is Bilbo Baggins and I believe Benedict Cumberbach is the voice of Smaug, the great dragon.
B004SRNH10|1.0|This app sucks! Not sure exactly why it's needed. Amazon, make sure it works before offering it please. Finally got the game to work like it did prior to needing Adobe Air
B009E3EYMY|5.0|One of only two items I have pre-ordered on Amazon and was not disappointed. Great concert from a classic band. Much tighter and more disciplined than their performances as youngsters and of course the mixing and sound work is from a  different era; Page still retains some of that raw edge that makes his guitar so distinctive. As expected there are better versions of some of the songs (in my opinion) but others may be their best live recording yet. Have only watched the blu ray end to end once but lover every moment of it. Highly recommended.

B009RI4FRU|4.0|A very stylized movie which can be good if it adds to or enhances the story.  In this case,  Wes Anderson and crew manage to use quirky camera angles, interesting sets, and artistic color correction to create a very entertaining movie.  It is very funny in spots, has good characters and a good ending.  The filming style was what I liked most about this movie. It really enhanced the story.  When I saw the ad for this on the slides that they show before movies start,  I was not interested.  The synopsis on the slide was: &#34; A 12 year old boy and girl run away and have the people of a small island town looking for them as a storm approaches&#34;  The slide also showed a picture of some old 1960's stuff like a record player on a beach.  Not good advertising.  When I watched a preview and realized who the director was I decided to watch it.  So if you like quirky, funny stories filmed in a very interesting way then you should see this film.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|My daughter is 8 years old and loves this app. she does the task before school each morning. It only tacks a few minutes if that to do. The graphics are really cool and child friendly and the fact that there is a little task to do each day makes it so much better then any other countdown i have had in the past.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I appreciated a doctor's perspective on what I have ALWAYS believed!  I felt the book was written well (although a bit technical at times for me personally).  I thought he did a great job expressing what his sense of heaven was like and I enjoyed taking the journey along with him!

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It is a good book . It is a very quick read i read it in an hour. Great book
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|I recieved the movie in an timely order. It was in very good condition and it was in perfect condition. Could not be any more happy with the purchase
B009VB97EY|2.0|It really wasn't what I expected, although I guess I should have expected what it was (smile).  Glad I didn't take the time to go to the theater to see it.

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This man was a political genius.  He knew what to say, how to say it and even better WHEN to say it.  He was a master of  knowing people and how to get the most from them. I have an even greater respect and admiration for Mr. Lincoln than ever before.  All I knew about him from school  was that he freed the slaves.  I was never taught about his political genius.  While reading the book I began to feel like I knew him. when he was shot and the book ended I  missed him and mourned for what might have been had he lived.  The inscription on the momument to Lincoln in Washington D.C. has more meaning for  me than ever  before.  \\"In this temple as in the hearts of those for whom he saved the union the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined  forever\\". The late  Bishop Fulton J. Sheen, in a speech honoring both Washington and Lincoln, said that \\"Washington was the father of our country, but  Lincoln was it's savior.\\" I now am aware of why.  The meticulous research  and style of Mrs. Goodwin's  writing demostrate that the word talent does not begin  to describe  the author's abilities..<br />A facilitating read. A moving experience,and wonderful expose of Mr. Lincoln as more than a beautiful momument.<br /><br />M.J.M
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is a great show, primarily because Norman Reedus from Boondock Saints is the man.  At first he may come off as a poor choice for a southern country boy, but he will quickly become your favorite character.  This show could likely have been just as successful if it was just an apocalyptic scenario without the zombies, but they add the needed suspense and draw a line between humanity and death.  Through 3 season, I still can't put a finger on why I like this show, but I do know I enjoy watching it.  One of those shows that if you started it late, you will want to spend a weekend watching it continuously.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a good game but I wont give it 5stars until u  put the  stuff on it that minecraft has on the xbox so if u want me to give the game 5 stars get the things that's on the xbox version please think about the 5 stars

B005OCHOZS|5.0|I really loved this book!  The stories were great and while I don't plan to go vegan, I will try a few of the recipes.  The book has inspired me as a runner and reminded me why I love running!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So cute. Kids and I love it. Passes the time on the road and simple to use. Just be sure to monitor their play time, don't want them spending all your money! ;P
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Fun movie and looks great in Blue Ray. I really enjoyed this movie, fun for all ages. Can't wait for part two.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|Well worth the time. I thought the POV was well done for such a unique subject. I would recommend this to just about anyone.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|An easy way to see where your Kindle Fire is as battery-wise.  It also gives info on time remaining for each kind of app use.
B000683VI4|5.0|It was a special request for a very dear, sweet friend who recently lost her husband.  The movie also included their special song.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show has always been entertaining to watch. Good humor and action. Although it has a different feel now then when it first started, I feel the show is still worth watching and is still one of my favorite shows today.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Another entertaining game from Alawar!  Definitely worth the price - awesome graphics - I love the Adventure / Hidden Object / Puzzle games this developer puts out.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|if you like puzzles then you'll like Flow Free. It's playful, colorful, and addictive! Great for kids and adults (and adults who act like kids!)
0547884591|5.0|I've enjoyed reading Tim's latest book. I pre-ordered the 4HC months before its release. This was due in large part because of how much I enjoyed the 4 Hour Body. The 4HC is a great book with humor and wit sprinkled through out its pages.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Different kind of game where you trail colors with your finger matching dot to dot.  Excellent puzzle game, lots of fun.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|New to Joes fiction or a vet, you will enjoy his take on the uselessness but inevitable drive of us humans to resort to violence to get what we want or need. Have not been disappointed by him yet
B0098460O4|5.0|Kudos to everyone who helped make this CD. It is fabulous and the voices of these two kids who are only 17 is absolutely amazing. If you love great music buy this CD.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I had a real problem putting this book down and felt even worse when it was finished. It gives clear insight into what exactly happened on the night in May and the brave men who made it happen. Even more upstanding, the author is putting all proceeds to veteran affairs and support groups. An amazing, well illustrated book that I will read over and over again.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so much fun.  It took me a while to figure out I could spend all those coins I kept winning, but great.  It caused my phone to run hot on my last device but works find on the Droid Razr Maxx.  I installed it on my kindle fire, but removed it.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|great movie have always been a fan and now i can share the movie with my kids in great quality
B009NPA3Q4|4.0|The perfect cd for anyone who likes country music even if they are not familiar with him! Great soundtrack! fast too
B008QDCZ3S|3.0|I have over 30 different versions of this amazing album. It's one of my favorites records so my rating, based on the music alone, would be as many stars as Amazon would allow me to fill the screen with.<br /><br />However, to help people who are already fans of the album decide whether to buy yet another copy of this often reissued record, this review is strictly based on the sound quality of the 2012 SACD released by Analogue Productions. This is the second SACD version that has been released. The first was from Sony that used Mark Wilder's fantastic 1997 remix/mastering. Both SACDs use the same 5.1 mix, which has the 3 track master tape spread among the Left, Center and Right channels, with a just hint of reverb in the surrounds.<br /><br />Fred Plaut recorded many of Columbia's classic Jazz albums at the old 30th Street recording studio. He knew how to capture the sound of the place. His recordings were always of superb quality, and this album is no exception. It's brilliantly recorded, which is why it's one of the albums that is reissued with every new format that comes along.<br /><br />This SACD doesn't fare as well. It's by far the thinnest version I own, rendering the instruments as doughy and uninteresting. Analogue Productions advertised this as coming from the original 3 track masters, which means Bernie Grundman gave the album a remix, albiet with only three tracks to work with. I was hoping I would finally be able to replace my old Japanese CD that contained the original mix. Oh well. Opportunity lost.<br /><br />I can't say this disc (DSD or redbook layer) gives me much listening satisfaction knowing the wide fidelity of the original recording. I wonder what it could sound like without first going through a mastering engineer's set of filters and EQs.<br /><br />Skip this one and wait for the next release touted as the 'Ultimate' version.<br /><br />BTW, I'm writing this a few moments after I heard the news of Mr. Brubeck's passing. Thanks for the great music, Dave!t music, Dave!
B00559B9N8|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle is one of my favorite books.  You can watch the animated version but the book is better.  Howl and Sophie and cast are adorable.
B004QSQML8|5.0|I love this movie and being able to have it on blu-ray is even better.extras and alternate version was great also
B0052TDGQO|4.0|It came in literally 2 days....its a great cd with tons of sounds from the American Idol winner Scotty! You will definetly love and its a great Xmas gift!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I was under the impression that this was going to wrap up the series.  Boy was I wrong!  Regardless of the book being the end of the series, Riordan gives us another great chapter in The Heroes of Olympus series.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Its a great product for keeping notes.  I have it on my Kindle Fire and I use it to keep notes for writing projects.  It syncs with my home desktop version so I don't have to transfer between devices by email.
B004U52VPS|4.0|I have this for my son. He is a massive fan of angry birds, so I didn't hesitate in buying this board game. It arrived very quickly and as soon as my son saw it, his eyes lit up. He loves the game although it can be quite tricky for him. The family can join it. It is a lot of fun and I am happy to recommend this.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Angry Birds Star Wars game is so cool. I really like playing this on my kindle. I like the things the birds can do.
B005LAII12|5.0|I know I will like this movie because I've already seen it I got it for my husband but it hasn't arived get
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I use this app to keep track of the moon phases.  I work indoors overnight at a hospital where the sky cannot be seen.  You can rotate the moon to see different sides and see the moon phase based on the date you choose.
B00015YVD6|3.0|I don't remember when this came out but I was little and loved it then. I watched it back along with a few other Tom Hanks movies and I still enjoyed watching it, but not as much as when I was a little one. Tom Hanks used to be cute!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|got for my kindle fire and love it has cool blue display, nice touch to dim, bedside option that keeps it on and weather info works great.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I cannot get enough of this show.  I own season one and watch it all the time.  Each time I watch it, I find something I might have missed before.  I now have my whole family involved in it.  We get disappointed when it's over for the night because we want to keep watching it.  It's a bit of a who is who and why.  Love the show.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is the best app i have both on my Kindle Fire and IPhone!  I especially like all the &#34;white, brown and pink&#34; noise choices to use when going to sleep, but there are many more for relaxation.<br />My daughter also uses it for her baby when traveling she doesn't have to bring her sound machine with her.
B003UAKE9Y|4.0|I bought this for my son. He loves it, but I feel it is very dark, much more than I had imagined. However it has a great storyline that made it compelling viewing.
B007HACDLK|5.0|A masterly and suspenseful book, with his usual unexpected twists make this one of his best books. Hope there are more to come.
B009SQOGZ2|4.0|I normally don't like to watch cartoon type shows but this was very entertaining.  Ages 4 to 62 watched it all togetheer.  I've even watched it again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love it! Had me and my husband hooked from the very first episode. We get ours online so yes you have to wait a day to get it but NO COMMERCIALS! :-)
B00338QENI|5.0|This book broke my heart and opened my eyes.  I honestly had no idea what had gone on in the name of research in this country nor did I know how the blacks were treated as recently as forty years ago.
B007THA4FI|1.0|It was so bad I had to stop the miserable journey she was trying to take me on. It was sooo depressing!
B000SEGUDE|3.0|This book would have been astounding had it been written fifty or a hundred years ago.  However interesting the framework of the story is, it seemed contrived, and the overall message was not that compelling or new.  The characters in the book were great, though, and I often was disappointed when a thread would end &#34;too early.&#34;
B007HACDLK|5.0|What a great book. kept me close to my kindle until I finished it.<br />I would recommend it to women and men.  I finished it and gave it to my husband to read.<br />Just not enough stars to say how much I liked this book.
B003UESJF6|5.0|I loved this movie, could watch it nearly every day! Price and condition were fine too!<br /><br />Code: great buy! Lol
B0031RAOVY|1.0|A horrible sad movie. This is a thousand times more sad than old yeller. Made my cousin's 6 year old cry and cry.
030758836X|1.0|I really wish I could return this book. It was really not that entertaining, was predictable and a very weak ending.<br /><br />I suppose there were parts I was entertained as I did finish it. But was not at all impressed.
1452110581|4.0|I bought this for my friend with 5 cats for Christmas. I had to thumb through the poems myself before I wrapped and it captures a cat's mind purr-fectly.<br />The book itslef is a little small, but the font is easy to read and the pictures are adoralbe. It's well made and very nice for a coffee table book.<br />Cat lovers galore would love this conversation piece!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A twisted, twisted tale. A &#34; can't put it down &#34; kind of story.  Can't wait to read more from this author.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book... Just as good as the first book. I can't wait for the: third book to come out. If you haven't start reading this series you definitely should check it out.
B008458O3S|5.0|Very clever logic game.  It's hard to put down once you start.  The levels gradually get harder and harder, teaching you along the way. Then when you finally finish the last puzzle and you think you've mastered the game, and you're disappointed that you'll have to search for another logic game that can hold your interest ... a whole NEW bonus tier becomes available with just as many levels as the normal mode, but the difficulty level is right where you left off!  AWESOME!
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Non fiction meets fiction. Loved it! Also enjoyed the anime effects here and there. Highly recommended for anyone who likes action and is a history buff.
1423140605|3.0|This is a great series, I can't wait until my kids are old enough to read it with me. Great book, just what I'd expect from Mr. Riordan
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|You don't need to be a professional artist to play this (and in fact, having the pictures look silly adds to the amusement) but you still need to be a good thinker. As you go on, the puzzles get progressively harder. It's a very well thought out and imaginative game.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|This is a fantastic compilation at a great price. Dickens is a master of literature, and his character descriptions, both main and minor, are without equal. The illustrations add to the enjoyment of the books, although the captions are too small to read on a Kindle.  I have read many of his novels, but having all of them together in one product is great, so I am reading them all again.
B003V6L94Q|2.0|I saw the Zack Brown Band on a television special with Jimmy Buffet and thought they were great. This cd was more bluegrass than country.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|I have watched every episode, and now that season 5 is about to be laid to rest, I only find one thing slightly disturbing.  Granted I gave up riding in the mid '80,s.  Jax's riding apparel strikes a false note.  As I wistfully look at all the hogs go by... I surely miss my riding days in sunny CA, the wind in my face, my hair blowing in the wind (Pre mandatory helmet laws)!!  Any way back to Jax... his white sneakers and those baggy jeans, look totally weird to me.  I look at riders today, and I do see the occasional sneaker clad rider, mostly on crotch rockets, but I don't see many hog riders sporting baggy pants and white sneakers... Just Sayin'
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My grandkids are really into Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, so I thought they might like this for Christmas.  They loved it!  Score one for Gammer!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a fan of The Walking Dead who stopped watching halfway through Season 2. In my opinion, Herschel's farm devolved the show from interesting drama to trite soap opera. I gave the series a second chance for this new season, and I couldn't be happier that I did. The production quality is way up from Season 2. Where there used to be an utter lack of zombies, there is now almost an overabundance, with special effects extending beyond what I'd even come to expect out of Season 1. The plot is gripping and reasonably paced. I've gotten through the mid-season finale, and I can't wait for the show to come back on the air!
B000YH6YG8|4.0|Great movie and it was shipped to me earlier than I had expected.  Sound and picture quality were very good.
B0091XRL86|5.0|This very goofy movie will have you and your entire family laughing a lot.  The Oddly Curvaceous Pirate as well as the other oddly named ones will have you watching it multiple times to ensure you didn't miss anything.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|uniquely quirky coming of age story implying 1950s setting; understated, subtly intelligent and funny performances by all,especialy the younsters. .
B00785P2QC|3.0|keeps you occupied need to not have to tap to build. I liked the game just slow. I don't. like the idea of having buy contracts or credits.
B007TK77QE|3.0|I can't decide whether I would recommend this book to friends, even though I did enjoy it and thought it portrayed some of society's current problems in a sympathetic way.  I felt it gave me a better understanding of what underprivileged families (especially the children) go through to-day.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|You really do want to watch this.  Otherwise, you are like an ostrich with its head in the sand.  Yes, we do need better labelling laws, and regardless of what any &#34;study&#34; some commercial group puts out, industrial food is a poor substitute for the real thing.
0887431453|5.0|This book is a really good aid in addition to schoolwork.  It has a lot of activities that build on each other.  While at times, it may be repetitive, there are so many activities that you can skip over what you do not need, and use what you need, and still feel like you received your money's worth.  It can also help you gauge where you child is in school.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love all of Sylvia Day's books and this one is a great one.  I couldn't put it down.  She has a good flair for keeping my interest in a book.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I loved this DVD!  I love this series and I am looking forward to many more seasons! I can't wait for more!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Red Country is pretty much everything that should be expected in a fantasy novel by Joe Abercrombie at this point.  The novel offers a gritty and &#34;grown up&#34; take on an often sugar coated genre with a great focus on the development and growth of characters.  In many ways Red Country was an easier read than some of Abercrombie's past works, not quite as jarringly bleak or grim as Best Served Cold or The Heroes yet still thoroughly harsh and exciting.  Totally worth picking up a copy.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|I'm old and there is a lot in this book that will take some time to digest. I have a book I want to publish, so I will hang in there and use this info. It's well organized and if you know computers you will find this book very useful.
B000002J1Y|3.0|Really looked forward to getting this for my husband, but had to send it back because of the sound quality. The seller was very nice and the return went very well. Maybe I got a bad one as it happens sometimes. No negative feed back for seller just the one order.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|Batman: The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1 [Blu-ray] is a good movie. I was a funny of batman before this movie.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Aside from the phenomenal acting and excellent effects, the well written and thought out story lines are what keeps me coming back for more with American Horror Story. I highly recommend watching this show!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Great app for all the information you need regarding the time you have on your device battery for all your different activities...music, videos, reading, wifi, and what have you. Also lets you know how much time you need to be able to completely charge your device. I have fojnd this app verh useful and would definitely recommend it to anyone. I expecially like that it goes straight to the point without any superflous additions.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|Masterfully done and packaged, really great album that still looks pristine today in my car. Love the music, love the sound, it's my kind of shit.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|This cd is hot. I'm a big funny of Eminem. I love listening to his music. He makes good music.
B0091THDOM|1.0|Definitely not what i expected. It took a while and a lot of effort to even put the iphone5 inside.<br />Then I couldn't take it out !!. So if i had to answer a call, i wouldn't be able to since the phone was stuck inside. I had to cut the stiches with scissors to get my iphone back !!<br />I wouldn't recommend this product.
B002BAWIWU|5.0|I love this album, and the remastering is great! This album has a lot of fantastic Harrison classics! If you are a George Harrison fan, this is a must have!
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Does just what I needed.  I can now see multiple calendars.  The calendar format takes getting used to but it works.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|The game is good for angry birds, but once you complete a level you have to pay to get access to the next level.
B000LTAY1U|2.0|Very small watch....womans size.  Would not recommend this product for men.  Appears larger on the internet.  Hard to determine size when using phone to shop.
B002F6FQGK|5.0|I love this album, it is fun, upbeat, and unique! If you are looking for something that is different the the typical pop music out there currently, this band will be great!
B000YABS8E|5.0|We have watched this movie a few times and each time we love it!  Well made movie.  We would recommend it.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|LOVE!! LOVE!! LOVE!!!  Loved ALL the soundtracks for the saga.  These have introduced me to new artists I would probably never have known otherwise. Christina Perri is awesome as always...  and Reeve Carney - wow!  Saw him on Broadway in Spiderman ... He never disappoints!
B005I6EU48|5.0|I had bought this for my kindle fire originally. It fits the new iPad mini perfectly.  There is no stand feature obviously but it is an elegant cover nevertheless.
1118109791|5.0|I received the product on time, in perfect conditions. Didn't have any problem, and when I ask a question about it, they respond me very soon.
0547884591|5.0|Tim's writing style is part funny man, part mad scientist and all hands on. I've been cooking for many years now and this old dog managed to learn some new tricks. Although this book covers some solid cooking techniques and walks you through hosting a dinner for friends step by step it is so much more. It gives you a peek into the mind of Ferriss and how he manages to learn so many things in such a short time. All while being totally entertained by his OCD boy next door charm.
B00407PNY2|1.0|Product description reads \\" Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy \\" but is only a single disc. (DVD) Buyer beware if it seems to good to be true it is. Correct description and be honest about your product.
034580404X|2.0|Can't understand why this is such a major success.<br />Perhaps it is because I am a man, while book is obviously written for women and trying to show sex from a female perspective.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book so much , its very interesting to me . I cant wait to read the next one
B007REV4YI|3.0|James Bond movies used to be a big \\"WOW\\"!<br />\\"Casino Royale\\", \\"Die another day\\", \\"Tomorrow never dies\\", \\"Golden eye\\", etc. - just to mention a few.<br /><br />Skyfall appears to be not as impressive in terms of the story itself, the colour of the movie, the acts, etc.  The much younger \\"Q\\" is also not as impressive as the former older \\"Q\\".  Not sure whether I would buy this blue ray to add to the recent purchase of the 22-bond movie collection.
B004OKFISQ|5.0|Brilliant, Emma & I already have the CD just wanted the album as a collectors piece best songs they ever did<br /><br />Barry & Emma
B0099114WO|4.0|My wife of 42 years dragged me to see this movie.  I expected to be lectured, and was, about taking your spouse for granted. What I didn't expect was to be taken in by this movie to the point where I ordered a copy. Streep and Jones took a preachy movie and made it entertaining. Not for young children, though. You will have some explaining to do that will make you squirm.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|Slow moving and hard to follow...difficult read ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok ok done done done crap
0765322889|1.0|Despite the poor reviews, I gave this book a chance because of the sample I downloaded on my kindle. I read the prologue and it was very intriguing - it definitely left me with wanting more so I bought it. Terrible mistake. The book quickly went downhill after that. I made it to Chapter Three before I put it down never to be picked up again. I will probably be critiqued for not giving the book a chance, but I shouldn't have to read to page 250 or get past book 3 for a series to become interesting. I read books as a means of entertainment and if I'm not being entertained I'm not going to waste the time nor should I have to. It should be, especially a fantasy series, interesting from the get go. But there doesn't seem to be any kind of direction and Erickson throws random characters at you without any kind of fore-mentioning, some of which have absolutely ridiculous names such as Sorry? Tattered Sail? Quick Ben? I realize it's fantasy, but nothing seemed believable besides the first battle. Do not waste your time reading this, it's crap.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|\\"Beautiful Disaster\\" is a fairly simple story. Boy meets girl in college they fall in love and drama happens. The writing is also simple. It's not bad, but it also isn't Pulitzer winning.  It's simple. The author doesn't try to wow us with her prose and the descriptions are good enough to give us all a clear idea of what is happening and where we are. What is most interesting about this book and what everyone is talking about are the beautiful, insane, neurotic and disastrous characters.<br /><br />I came into this book with a little too much foreknowledge. I knew the opinions of many. I was told that either Travis was the most abusive man in romance history or the dreamiest guy ever. He's not. He is damaged, obsessive and unstable, but dreamy or ultra abusive? No.<br /><br />I literally envisioned Travis walking around slapping women and kicking babies. He doesn't do that, but he is probably the most violent character I have ever read. Really? Yes, he is more violent than vampire hunters or werewolf alphas. Why? Because he's a normal guy in a normal world and all he does is fight. He fights for absolutely everything! He fights because he's hurt, he fights because he's jealous, he fights because he's insecure, he fights because he wants money, he fights because he wants security.... he even fights the furniture when no else is around to punch.<br /><br />There are scenes where his temper flares that literally made me cringe. I could never imagine dating him. I could never imagine standing idly by while a friend dates him. It blows my mind that I have seen his name on lists of fiction characters girls would most like to date. Travis is terrifying. He is unstable. He is not in love with Abby, no he is obsessed with her! Irrationally obsessed with her and it is so frightening how quickly he goes from `hey sweet thing' to `you are my life and I would die for you!'<br /><br />I have to wonder what kind of unrealistic world McGuire is from why Travis is never arrested inthis book. I kept waiting for the shoe to drop and scenes where Abby visits him in jail. Nope. This guy gets away with beating up random guys on the street and in bars. He gets away with stalking, harassing Abby for a third of this book. He also gets away with screaming and crying outside of Abby's dorm room all night. I don't know how your college experience was, but in mine someone always has a paper to write, a hundred pages to read or an exam to study for. No way that campus security or the police wouldn't have been called on Travis.<br /><br />Then there is Abby. While I think Travis is extremely dangerous, I do not believe he is the type of guy to physically or mentally abuse his girlfriend. He is extremely unstable and co-dependent so any emotional abuse he inflicts is based off of his extreme obsession and emotional foolishness. Abby is the true abuser in this story. She literally pulls Travis through hell for most of this book. Only an idiot wouldn't know that he was in love with her. She ignored that and dated Parker. Abby isn't that interesting, so she must be the most beautiful girl ever for these guys to put up with her crap. What kind of self-respecting woman kisses one guy and then sleeps beside another every night? She mercilessly toyed with Travis and Parker's feelings. She even placed Parker in danger, because Travis is so unstable and violent.<br /><br />It blows my mind that this book is considered a love story and not a cautionary tale. This book should be in the mental health section of the bookstore. It's a book about codependency on the highest level. It is also a book about rage, about violence and jealousy. It makes me sick to think that there are people like Abby and Travis in the world and that they can actually be in a relationship.<br /><br />Their friends and family's reactions to their relationship is so unrealistic. If my brother came to me and told me it was forever with a girl he has been dating for a month, I would be wary and have a talk with him. Everyone is too accepting if this dysfunctional relationship.<br /><br />\\"When you have it Brazil...you'll get it\\" says Travis to a friend who doesn't understand how this couple can be so serious. Yes, people have married and loved  their high school and college sweethearts, but it's about time that authors stop writing these characters who are in forever love. How often does a 19-year-old stay with their boyfriend for the rest of their lives? Time to stop overwhelming us with irrational ideas on love. Why can't two teenagers meet and live without insane talk about marriage and forever?<br /><br />Originally posted on bookgeekconfessions.tumblr(.com)

B008ASLK8A|4.0|Even though I enjoyed watching some of the old Sherlock Holmes movies, I was not really a great fan of this character until I saw Robert Downey Jr. in the first movie he played the great British Detective.  I enjoyed this one, Sherlock Holmes: A game of Shadows, even more than the last one.  This time his detective skills and his other physical fighting skills are tested to the limit as he matches wits with his old nemesis.  I imagine some old fans of Sherlock Holmes may not enjoy this more modern version of the brilliant detective, but I found Robert Downey Jr.s portrayal  to be delightful, refreshing and brilliant.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are a Sherlock Holmes fan you should enjoy watching this film.<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.

B008QTV3X0|2.0|I deleted this series after viewing the first episode. The nudity was not important to the storyline and the language seemed forced. I've known former pow's and they were still able to control their language.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I'll be forever grateful to Christopher Nolan for Batman Begins.  The Dark Knight was unusually effective, but Batman Begins rescued The Detective from Joel Schumacher and certain death.  The Dark Knight Rises is purely an exercise in audience fulfillment, and rightly so.  It doesn't have the dramatic chops to \\"rise\\" above its predecessor, but that's a tall order.  In my estimation, Christopher Nolan's aural films will not age as well as people think.  Batman Begins was a bit dry, The Dark Knight was too long and the Dark Knight Rises both dry and too long.  Inception too is one that works the first time and depreciates quickly on repeated viewings.  But for the sake of entertainment, this trilogy won't go quickly into the \\"night\\" so to speak.  Someday a better Batman will indeed show up, but it's good we've got these three for now.<br /><br />The Batman Begins Blu-Ray was once a trend setter and it still looks good.  The sound pales greatly in comparison to it's successors however.  The Dark Knight still pops so obviously the new TDKR Blu-Ray is pretty darn good.  The 35mm footage might as well be 16mm compared to the excellent  IMAX scenes. I think the discrepancy in quality is much more jarring here than in either Inception or The Dark Knight.  Wally Pfister's shallow depth of field lensing on the large format footage looks great at times, but the focus puller often struggles to keep up with the actors so we get a missed focus and a eyeful of bokeh vomit.  As a photographer, I usually gravitate toward a frame full of content rather than a waxy out of focus picture, but that's personal.  I think the picture isn't even the highlight of the disc really.  The surround sound on this baby will blow your windows out man.  The foley artists, sound mixers and Hans Zimmer really put a show on for you in the Dark Knight Rises if you have the setup to tap into.<br /><br />Movie:  8/10<br />Picture:  8.5/10<br />Sound:  10/10

B0052RE4MQ|1.0|I read YA books with my daughter.  This series had a semi-promising beginning.  It felt like the author didn't have enough material for this book.  It felt like filler while waiting for book 3.  There was no real character development or plot movement in this book.  It has put us off the rest of the series.  This story could have most likely been told in 2 books.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Watching this movie is an annual tradition at our house. This year we bought the 3D version and it is amazing! We all noticed things we had never seen before in the 2D version. The hot chocolate scene has always been my daughter's favorite and it really pops to life. If you have a 3D TV, don't miss out on this. There appear to be two versions of the 3D; one version utilizes the blue/red glasses and one requires active 3D glasses. The version this review refers to is the active 3D glasses version.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I have read the first book so far.  It is excellent!  I got the books after reading about Philip Pullman in ffrf's daily freethought emails. (see ffrf.org)  It is fast paced, origonal, deeply philosophical without being pedantic.  The daemon's are a wonderful device in the plot and themes.<br />I highly enjoyed the first book and will finish the series.<br />  John Whitney
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This fantastic voyage set in a narrative,  that is occasionally funny and occasionally sad,  but always poetic, is one of my favorite reads this year.  I cannot compare it to anything I have read as of late, because to me it is in a class all its own.  If you want to curl up on your favorite reading chair and take a fantastic voyage,  filled with courage and a deep spiritual message, do read this book
B000SEGUDE|1.0|I picked it up becasue I love books that they make into movies. This book was very hard to follow. I lost interest immediately and didn't get further than a few chapters. It may just be a slow developing story, but was too slow for my tastes.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The SB 400 fills the niche when the need is for compact, portable flash.<br />I have other Nikon flashes, SB600 and SB800s which are GREAT &#34;workhorse&#34; flashes. The SB400 will not do any of the Nikon Creative Flash functions. The head is fixed, will not bounce, It will not command or respond to the remote functionality of the other Nikon flash family however, when all you need is a lightweight, low-profile flash head, this is it.<br />Coverage is great.

0547884591|5.0|This book really consists of 2 very different topics in one. The first is on learning techniques and how to learn more effectively and the second on cooking. Even if you are only interested in one of the subjects and not both, I would still highly recommend this book. Bonus...if there is a college student in your life this would be a really great xmas gift. Easy ways to eat well and tools to learn more effectively... its hard to go wrong with that combo.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoyed playing it.  If you like puzzle games you will, too.First levels were easy but it got more challenging the longer I played.
B005J7K964|5.0|This is stunning! Using the best prints available and some still images Giorgio Moroder took this silent film masterpiece and redid the dialog cards, color tinted the frames, and added a great rock score. While there are more complete versions available, this is a whole lot of fun!
B006T5FDLG|5.0|I love Death Magnetic and was surprised to learn they put this out. These are the left over tracks to Death Magnetic and I can see why they didn't add them in Death Magnetic. They don't *quite* fit there but as a whole other album, it totally works. It took a listen or two but they really are great songs.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, I have been deployed to Afghanistan several times over the years, I found his descriptions extremely accurate. Frankly I do not understand the controversy. Almost everyone in my unit has read the book and I have not heard a single complaint, some have even said they wish he had been even more detailed. Thank you to the author for writing down what really happened. I already know nothing on the news is true! It's good to hear the real side.
B00136Q784|5.0|I found this band through Pandora when I heard the song &#34;River of Deceit&#34;. I looked it up and immediatly previewed the songs. Halfway through I just bought the whole thing. If you like the sound of 90's Grunge, this album will not disappoint you. How could it with the late, great Layne Staley of Alice in Chains and Mike McCready, guitarist of Pearl Jam and Temple of the Dog? You can definitly hear the influences of AIC and Pearl Jam though their sound is their own and is amazing.
0345803493|2.0|The second in the series and it just like a movie thats got more than 1 in the series. This book took me looker than the first to get into to read. Didnt like it at all..

0345803485|1.0|The 3rd in the series and of course its worst than the 2nd one. Its worst 1 yet, still reading the 3rd book cant seem to keep me intertain more than 3 pages before am putting it down..Its tooken me a month or more to read it..

B00AFEXRME|3.0|That Denzel Washington is a movie star of the first rank is proven once again in Robert Zemeckis' 2012 crisis-driven character study, a film that starts out very strong but then turns into something of a morality play about addiction and personal accountability. Despite the slowdown in the narrative momentum, the actor lends a chilling honesty and his considerable charisma to his textured portrayal of Whip Whitaker, an ace commercial pilot for a regional Southern airline whose debilitating alcoholism forces him to live in a world of denial and distrust. He's middle-age, divorced, and estranged from his son, but he can still party hard with a sexy flight attendant and fly a jet airliner the morning after with the help of a line of cocaine. Their 9AM flight to Atlanta faces severe turbulence upon take-off, but it's nothing Whip can't handle with his skillful bravado intact. Having achieved momentary calm, he falls asleep at the controls after downing a couple of airline-size bottles of vodka mixed with orange juice. Suddenly the jet loses its hydraulics and descends uncontrollably with its engines on fire.<br /><br />To the shock of his by-the-book co-pilot, Whip decides to invert the plane and fly it upside down to achieve some stability in order to maneuver a last-ditch attempt at an emergency landing in an open field populated with a congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses. Miraculously, only six of 102 passengers and crew perish upon impact, and Whip is hailed as a hero much like Sully Sullenberger after he heroically saved a jet on the Hudson River. This exacting sequence is as thrilling as they come in the movies, and Zemeckis ([[ASIN:B0026O475M Cast Away]]) brings a propulsive realism to what must have seemed like a fantastical idea in John Gatins' screenplay. What follows this life-changing incident is far less unique as it becomes clear that Whip's blood alcohol count was well over the legal limit during the flight, and the ensuing investigation could easily destroy his career and send him to prison on manslaughter charges. He gets help from former colleague Charlie Anderson, the pilots' union representative for the airline, as well as Hugh Lang, a severely humorless lawyer who is pushing hard to discredit the toxicology reports which prove Whip's unfit condition for flying. The ongoing public pressure of the case sends Whip into isolation at his late father's farm where he begins another downward spiral into alcohol.<br /><br />He gets involved with recovering heroin addict Nicole whose own story of desperation is juxtaposed with his until they meet at the hospital and enter into a relationship. All this leads to a climactic hearing with the National Transportation Safety Board where his fate will be determined. Washington is onscreen for nearly the film's entire 139-minute running time, and his impassioned performance is fiercely without vanity. He is unafraid to show Whip's pathetic denial of accountability and brings a palpable face to his character's substance abuse. The supporting cast is solid with Don Cheadle lending a calm Machiavellian spirit to Lang and Bruce Greenwood a stalwart presence as unconditionally supportive Charlie. British actress Kelly Reilly ([[ASIN:B000ETRCN0 Mrs. Henderson Presents]]) sports a convincing Southern accent, but I found her a bit too languid as Nicole. In pure scene-stealing mode, John Goodman plays Whip's unapologetic drug dealer Harling Mays like he was redoing Walter Sobchak in [[ASIN:B000I9WW0E The Big Lebowski]]. It's a comically anomalous turn but something of a relief especially during the sturm-und-drang of the film's second half. Speaking of which, Zemeckis and Gatins' unsubtle storytelling approach resuscitates all-too-familiar scenes of alcohol abuse that make the story feel more predictable than it had to be as the inevitable events play themselves out. Regardless, Washington makes the film eminently watchable.roy his career and send him to prison on manslaughter charges.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Vintage Grisham! The unexpected twists and turns, kept me turning the pages and could not put it down.  Wanted more and more. Wonderful
B00A7CI82I|2.0|Two great lead actors, loads of potential, it's shame this was so disappointing. Renner is a perfect choice for the next iteration, but the director sacrificed plot/character attempting to prove this was a Bourne installment. Far too many flashbacks to earlier films. Decent action and chase scenes but they don't compensate for the thin content. Not worth the purchase price, IMO. Go back and rent the original trilogy.
098555780X|5.0|Iwas so happy when i found out JB was writing a book I have been following him on youtube for a while but having a book to take with me and refere to is fun and has added to how i use paracord
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Before I start may I say that it's very immature of people to be rating the movie as a 1 star when it's the packaging and the DL that is the reason why you're giving this film such a low rating.<br /><br />Really folks grow up, if you're going to buy a copy of this movie I would suggest purchasing a physical copy and even if you buy a DL copy do not go into a review of the movie and ONLY base your score on the freaking content you purchased the movie on.<br /><br />This movie is an art, probably one of the best conclusions to a trilogy out there. I saw it when it came out immediately in IMAX and I had goosebumps throughout the entire thing.<br /><br />The cast is wonderful, the storyline is full of twists and turns and the characters are very endearing. I also got attached to Anne Hathaway as Catwoman. She just transforms from shy, stuttering virgin, to sexy vixen in a matter of seconds in her first appearance.<br /><br />Tom Hardy is a fantastic villain and the opening sequence of the movie is incredibly intense and sends the tone just straight for the movie. The other villain is very predictable, I knew immediately when I saw them that they were going to be very deceiving in the end.<br /><br />I also loved the ending. This movie is fantastic, and I would hope that people whom are reviewing it, review it based on the plot not whine and moan about in what way did they purchase the movie.<br /><br />That in by no means is connected to the movie, it's the way YOU chose to purchase it.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Beautiful graphics, including effects for different seasons. Puzzles are only moderately challenging to an experienced puzzle game fan, but still very enjoyable and immersing. The only drawback is an abrupt ending - enjoy for the journey, not the destination. I had a few minor glitches on my Samsung Galaxy Player 5, but nothing that ruined any part of the game. The map feature is very helpful, and a hint guide is included, but I didn't use any hints, so I can't comment on them! I would be willing to buy other games like this.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Absolutely loved this book!  It has the makings for an awesome series.  I could not put it down!  Loved the plot and all the twists along the way, she keeps you guessing and wanting more.  Can't wait for the next book!
1594744475|5.0|I wanted this book for so long, but I have to admit I didn't think it was anything I'd be able to pull off. I still haven't tried anything yet, but the difference is now I think I can.<br /><br />They break down lots of recipes to make these cute little bento lunches. They go into the history a bit, and all the tools of the trade. Then they give cost cutting ideas to get the same effect without having to buy a whole new kitchen. Crystal and Maki also encourage creativity and use of leftovers as well as balancing out the meal.<br /><br />I also thought I'd need to get a special bento box, but this is another myth they slash. There are traditional and contemporary boxes, but you can simply buy a small storage container as well. Thanks goodness, I have boxes on hand for that.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to making these during time off from school, while we go on our adventures instead of just getting fast food. The small storage would easily pack up into coolers for us to enjoy later on.

B008QE9VJI|1.0|The first ten minutes or so of this movie that are set in the 18th century do manage to create some atmosphere.  From there it all goes downhill.  This movie is worse than I imagined it would be.  The humor in it is for the most part dumb and the storyline is lame.  For much of the movie it seems like the plot is centered around the rivalry between two fish canneries. Supposedly Tim Burton is a fan of the original show but it sure isn't evident in the way he parodies the characters. The writing is sloppy, one character out of nowhere is revealed in the last 10 minutes to have been a werewolf all along. It comes way out of left field and makes no sense. I found most of this movie boring and uninteresting.  A good cast completely wasted.
1449410243|5.0|Okay, so maybe Homosexual Cats aren't exactly dinner table worthy, but The Oatmeal is great entertainment.  My 11-year old daughter was virtually trying to rip it from my hand as I read it.  Always gold from Matthew Inman!!

I went to the Kindle store and ordered not expecting to have to read the small drop down list of compatable models - it showed it on standard kindle, right?.  It downloaded to my Archive folder where I attempted start the app.<br />A dialog box opens saying \\"not compatible with this device\\".  Calling Amazon support got me a person on the line that would only say the canned responses instead of listening to what the customer was asking or saying.  Finally I got her to check on what Kindles the app would run on, not my Kindle Touch.<br />So... I am unhappy with the way it was advertised and with how Amazon support was in communicating with.
0547884591|4.0|I am no doubt a Tim Ferriss fan and have enjoyed my previous experiences with his work.  BUT, I try to judge every product/book/service/recommendation of his on its own with a clean slate.  The 4-hour chef was a very entertaining read.  The colorful pages are beautiful.  Going back to the black & white of The 4-hour body feels like jumping back decades in a time machine.  Visually, the book is definitely a joy to read.  A lot of the recipes were really interesting, particularly the ones that seemed more like science experiments.  As a vegetarian, many of them I don't plan on making myself, but there is still enough good tactical knowledge to apply to other recipes.  The only negative feedback is that I would have liked to see more examples of meta-learning in different areas.  Could have dealt with less food examples at the end from professional chefs and more blueprints and examples on how to apply meta-learning to other everyday chores.  But overall, Tim did a fine job and it was money well spent.  I don't often pay full price for books, but I'm happy to support Tim and the 4-hour movement.

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|For Walking Dead fans, this zombie head display is great! You actually have to put the screw driver in the zombie's eye to open the case and get out the DVD's. The zombie head is really gross and gory (as to be expected). We bought as a gift for my future brother-in-law, who will love to display this in his &#34;man den&#34;.
B005IQZB14|3.0|While this is an autobiographical story, there are times when the author introduces very poetic and beautiful imagery in her story,  Sometimes she appears to open up about herself just as quickly, she begins to not allow the reader into too much.  The ending was very abrupt and moves on to the future with no segue.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Tim is a great writer.  He includes much more in his books than traditional writers (on the body).  Very readable, very interesting.

B00338QENI|3.0|A great history ... but a little boring to read at times.  Overall I liked learning about these cells, but not a &#34;fun&#34; read
B000VSYDRM|1.0|I love a good mystery.  This was dark, violent and not a mystery.  The dreary,damp, dark setting made it an uncomfortable and uninteresting experience.  But then again that's my opinion based on what I like.  I imagine there is an audience for just such a period piece.
B002J20T12|5.0|Wow!  So much important and interesting information and so little time!  This type of book helps the reader understand the world today, industrialzation, and civilization.  J. Diamond did a fantastic job writing this book. - surprisingly easy to read, as it captures your attention and doesn't let go.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This makes getting around my kindle files very managable.  I guess because it manages files kind of like windows explorer it was somewhat intuitive to use.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Cassia goes through more adventure in Crossed and i definitely missed Xander's character in this book, but looking forward to his secret in book 3!  Not a difficult read but still very entertaining.
B0000669JL|5.0|This cd will always be the ultimate. I lost my collection in a move so I have slowly tried to re-acquire all my 'good stuff'. I listened to this album when I was in the Bahamas and also when I traveled to Egypt. Great music along with great memories and sights!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|only shows first 10 updates then locked blue boxes! Please fix this!!!! App on my phone is wayyyy better. You would think they would already have this fixed.
0439023521|5.0|I didn't fall into the HG hype early on. So, I went to see the movie, first, yet long after it had been in the theaters. Surprised, that it was so good, I immediately bought the book afterwards, knowing that the book would be that much better than the movie.<br /><br />I have to say, there have been few books that I have read in one sitting, and I have read a LOT of books. But this one... I started reading on a Friday night and didn't put it down until I was done at 6am Saturday morning!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It's great to see an animated movie with a female star who chooses her own destiny based on her true self, rather than the classic animated movie where the girl's worth is tied to being with the boy.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book has it all - witches, vampires, ghosts, and demons.  If you liked Anne Rice's The Mayfair Witches, this book is right up your dark alley!
B006LR0XLM|4.0|If you already have dropbox on your computer(s) this is a great app for your Kindle. Transferring files from your computer to the dropbox is easy, and getting them on to your Kindle is pretty easy, too, if you're using text files. my only disappointment is I can't seem to move jpg files from the computer to the Kindle. On the other hand, if I put the picture into a MS Word doc, I can transfer it just fine. I would definitely recommend this app.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Everyone in the family has watched this move. Was at a good price and plays nice. I will recommend future purchases.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|You don't need to carry a bunch of tourbooks the next time you travel, if you have this app on your Kindle Fire. Plug in the name of a city, and you can find out about attractions, restaurants and hotels. There are reviews and often photos. Perhaps the only drawback to it is needed a WIFI connection to use it. But in most cities there are a lot of free hot spots where you can use it.
B00005JO9J|5.0|This arrived much quicker than i expected. It was also packaged very well so the dvd wasn't sliding around in the box. It will make a great gift for my sister!
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I purchased a copy for my 89y/o mother who was born and raised in Honolulu because as I watched the movie and listened to the soundtrack, I couldn't help but think it would have some meaning to her.  To my amazement, she was totally excited with the songs because it took her back to her younger years with pleasant memories.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Highly addictive. It has so many mini games that you can't poossibly get bored. People fuss about the energy issue but, if you have a life away from your apps it's no biggie.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Every two or three times you do a level an ad takes you away from the game to the internet and every time I go to the internet there is an Angry Birds screen up so that I can buy more angry birds stuff. Very annoying!<br /><br />the game is fine.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This App is a lifesaver for me on the go and taking notes to share with my family at home.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game! it is awesome.I got it for my kindlle fire and loved it so much I got it for my phone.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wow! What a fast moving story. Men would like it, but I enjoyed it also. John Grisham says that it is strictly Fiction, One cannot<br />believe any one in the FBI, CIA or Attorney General's office after reading this book.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|We all love 50 shades but this is just as good in a different way! In this story there is more of the relationship and less of the sex! It takes you back to a younger relationship and the impulses and drama of a younger couple trying to figure it out.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I know that there is an update available but it isn't found on the kindle. Disappointing for a fan that enjoys playing on mobile devices as well as the kindle.
B002VECMAE|5.0|Such an interesting movie, and probably not well-known, but Excellent viewing. I think I would have named the film something that would appeal more to women also. . .as it is not just a \\"guy\\" picture.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Extremely useful.  Especially like being able to get weather reports, current and future, for any city in the US.  Great for travel planning.
B00782O7IY|5.0|The unique presentation of a black-and-white film, where the music could be called a Character, because it is basically about movies before the &#34;talkies&#34;. . .It is a really emotive piece, even though very few words are spoken.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|SHe loved this movie. We got it to follow our thanksgiving tradition of watching a new movie together. The dvd worked perfectly. No scratches. No skips.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|I cant really get into this game. I want to like it. The graphics are pretty cool.<br /><br />Got it for free as it was the Amazon free app of the day.<br /><br />I'll have to give it another try.<br /><br />For now though, its just ok.
1419705849|5.0|The 9 year old nephew requested this book, he was so excited to recieve it, he put away the DSi game he had just opened and immediately started reading. Loved it...since I am a teacher and enjoy reading myself.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Plays just like solitaire for windows. Love this game. Slightly addicted.<br /><br />You can start a game and pick it up at any point.<br /><br />Best of all, its free!
0810989956|5.0|The 9 year old nephew loves these books, so I got this to let him express his own ideas. Was super excited to receive.
B008MEM24S|3.0|I loved Where's My Water and played it obsessively.<br /><br />This app has me bored. Maybe its too similar to Wheres my Water.<br /><br />Graphics are good.<br /><br />I'll wait a while and try again. Maybe some time away will increase my rating.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Yes it is hard.. but there is &#34;spoilers&#34; that can help. Nothing compares to finding by yourself... Hours of hunt , graphics are exceptionnal, complicated enough that you can do it all over again... w/o hints !!!!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|I tried another app that claimed to do it all and was greatly disappointed.  This app truely does all I hoped for.<br /> - still pics with lots of modes to choose from<br /> - easy zoom<br /> - uses full screen (vs the other app I tried only used 2/3rds)<br /> - user friendly<br /> - movies
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome series.  Would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast paced, can't put it down, kind of book. :)
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I have 2 units and am purchasing a 3rd as a gift.  My first only lasted 4 years before I was unable to recharge the battery the 2nd is 3 years old and running strong.  I like it better than the Bissel as I am able to get behind the toilet and under more things with the Swivel.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I remember way back when when I first heard these guys and I was mesmerized.<br />It's been some time later and I still think of them in the same regard.<br />The songs are truly beautiful and will make any listener joyful and appreciative.<br />It's not very often that musicians of this caliber rise to the spotlight of contemporary music.<br /><br />Bravo!
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Great plot. Lots of action. Not a dull moment. A movie that I will watch again and again and again.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I first watched this movie when it came out and it was spectacular.<br />A couple of years later and I'm still thinking the same thing.<br />It's a great feel-good film that could easily be watched alone or with a group of friends.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B009LRE040|5.0|Not even the absense of the joker can bring this movie down.  It is in my opinion the best of the trilogy, and the best comic book movie of all time.  Anne Hathaway deserves an oscar nod.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very enjoyable.  Good plot.  I found the main character to be believable in his distrust of the authorities in view of his wrongful conviction.
B007HACDLK|5.0|When reading the book you can hardly put it down . It total engulfs you . Just a great read
1476715904|5.0|I loved, LOVED everything about this book.  I loved every character in this book. . . and have never felt so close to one as I did Layken.  The writing was beautiful, emotional, witty.  It was so emotional-- I swear I cried through 10 chapters. I needed a minute at the pink balloon chapter. :)  The events could be real live- and although my husband and I were not left with siblings we both bonded over mothers lost before their time.  Honestly this book is beautiful and I LOVED every single minute.
B0070UFMOW|4.0|This is a review of the FiiO E17 \\"ALPEN\\" portable DAC (digital to analogue converter) and headphone amplifier. The E17 (codenamed ALPEN by FiiO) is at the time of writing the flagship model of the company, which, in a sign of the times, is a specialised Chinese firm that focuses on engineering high-end amplifiers and DACs for headphones.<br /><br />The package includes the following:<br />1. The FiiO E17 ALPEN<br />2. a USB-mini USB cable<br />3. a 3.5mm connector (both ends feature a 3.5mm jack, which seems to be gold plated, although I'm not positive about this)<br />4. a 3.5mm to RCA adaptor<br />5. an optical connector<br />6. two silicone bands, which can be used to hold together the ALPEN and another portable device such as a smartphone<br />7. six rubber feet (!)<br />8. a velvet pouch<br />9. a brief instruction manual (8 small pages in English)<br />10. two screen protectors (!)<br /><br />As the completeness of the set would suggest, FiiO have really put a lot of thought into not just their device, but also into how it might be used by their target end user. I found this attention to detail quite impressive. The full set is designed to enable easy and immediate use with a range of applications, and in very a portable fashion, should you so wish it.<br /><br />As to the unit itself, the build quality, from external inspection, is very good. The case is a black-hued brushed metal finish that is well-machined and beautiful to behold. There are no rough edges and cheap plastic bits that were so characteristic of the inexpensive Chinese electronic product of yesteryear. The screen is a 2 colour OLED, and very clear. Buttons are are metal, in a very nice finish. The whole thing just exudes quality, of the sort one usually expects from devices of European or American manufacture.<br /><br />I have used the E17 only for about 2 weeks, and in only one set up so far:<br />-music files: ALAC (ripped/converted from CDs or SACDs by iTunes).<br />-player: iTunes on a macbook pro 7,1, or iPhone 4S<br />-headphones: several, all very high quality IEMs.<br />The music I listen to is almost exclusively classical, and the source material of very high quality.<br /><br />In the above set up I find the E17 does what it says it does: amplification is robust (to the point where I find I cannot turn up the volume to the maximum 60 for many tracks without risking damage to my ears). There is no distortion in the sound when used with Etymotic reference IEMs or JHA custom-made IEMs; when used with the Bowers and Wilkins C5, I notice at high volumes there is a certain amount of \\"strain\\": I believe this to be a reflection of the limitations of the earphone rather than the E17. Bass response is smooth: this is the first time I've heard \\"enjoyable\\" bass from the Etymotic's reference ER.4 series, famous for its highly accurate, neutral sound, a direct corollary of which is what may seem to be a more subdued bass. The treble response is likewise quite nice, although with my set up there is very little difference, as would be expected.<br /><br />I would like to record here a problem I faced early on when using the E17, as it may be helpful to other users. DACs and headphone amplifiers will mostly be used with digital sound sources stored in portable machines. A problem with sound reproduction from this sort of set up is that numerous components are in very close proximity to each other, and interference with the sound signal can potentially ensue. I believe I've experienced an example of this. When I plugged in the USB cable from the E17 to one of the two available USB docks on my macpro, I was greeted by horrible \\"interference\\" whenever the mouse moved (this problem has been documented in several reviews on the net). When I switched the USB cable to the second dock, all was pristine and beautiful. Both USB docks work properly, of course; the first however probably sits next to some internal component related to the trackpad, and when connected to an external DAC and amp such as the E17, produces audio interference whenever the trackpad is activated.<br /><br />Another reviewer has pointed out that the screen does not sleep; to switch off the display you'd have to toggle the Hold button. This is true, but of little consequence unless it shortens the lifespan of the display; I have not had the unit for long enough to be able to tell. Other reviewers on Amazon UK have pointed out that pairing the E17 with an Android smartphone can be a bit of a challenge, apparently requiring a separate USB cable or firmware/kernel modification. I have no experience with this.<br /><br />In summary, I think the ALPEN does what it says on the tin, and is a product of surprisingly high quality, supplied in a thoughtful package.<br /><br />ADDENDUM: From a general inspection of the reviews on Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, and headphone specialist sites, it seems to me that the major quality concern with the FiiO ALPEN is centred on the various output and input jacks, mainly the AUX input jack at the bottom of the unit and the headphone output jack at the top. Most complaints suggest that these parts are not built to the level of quality of the rest of the unit, and seem to come off or otherwise stop working. I have not owned my unit long enough to be able to reliably comment, but on visual inspection I can see that the metal ring on my AUX inlet jack is not precisely centred, suggesting it has not been manufactured or machined at the level of some of the better consumer electronic products available today.
0738727326|5.0|Gorgeous, Gorgeous, Gorgeous, Gorgeous. I am in love with this deck. The imagery is AMAZING. It instantly became my favorite deck as soon as I opened the package. Best Tarot deck purchase ever.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|This is a cute little app. From the main menu page you have a few areas open to you. Located on the screen is info for parents, info about their other apps,  and a cute little cow in a red hospital helicopter.<br /><br />To the left is a disclaimer for the parents from the app designers. It basically lets them know that this game is geared for children between the ages 2-6 that are interested in the basics of anatomy and medicine. Eight animals are included in this game, and no in-app purchases are included, so parents, you will not have to worry about accidental purchases. Third party advertising are also not something that you will need to worry about. Dr Panda apparently is certified by the kidSAFE seal program, and more information is available further down in the disclaimer. If you are impressed with this developer, they make their Facebook available, as well as a sign up to their newsletter for further information on their other games, etc.<br /><br />So while that is out of the way, let's get to the actual game. You can click on the cow in the helicopter, and it will wave at you, fly away and fly back, but that actually does not begin the game. You scroll down and you will pass three sets of room, two with two beds apiece in them where the sick patients go to get treated, and the bottom room being where the animals come and wait to be treated while Dr Panda kind of plays the receptionist.<br /><br />There are a lot of things going on here. Besides fixing the ailments of the animals that come in, which include an ear infection, cleaning teeth, fixing ribs, giving a shot etc, there are the other things like watering the plant in the hospital rooms, throwing the trash on the ground in the animal trashcan, pressing on the ran to make it run, and clicking on the boom box to allow music to flow. Changing the beds, music and fans will make the sick animals happy for a few seconds, but eventually you will just have to heal them.<br /><br />I did not have a preschooler around to test this game on, but I'm sure many will find it quite fun. It gets repetitive for there are only eight animals, but a 2-5 year old would definitely take a little while longer to manage and maneuver the controls. They will definitely need help progressing, but that should be a fun process.<br /><br />I will say this game did force close on me once, and there was a long lag at another moment (maybe around 40-45 seconds); nonetheless, this should be successful in distracting a youngster while teaching them something at the same time.r around to test this game on, but I'm sure many will find it quite fun.

0307387178|4.0|You cannot go wrong with a book written by Krakauer.  This is the second book from his pen I've read and I'm sure I will be back for more.  Jon not only brought the story of Chris McCandless to life, he made a convincing sell for Jack London's stories, Call of the Wild and White Fang.<br /><br />Being one that finds meaning in the outdoors, especially when pushing myself to the limits, I related to the story very well.  If I didn't have a family I could see myself traveling down a very similar road.  In a previous physicology class I discovered that I am a \\"space\\" person and not a \\"place\\" person.  McCandless was certainly one that identified with space and could not feel comfortable in one place very long.<br /><br />Krakauer used McCandless's own words throughout the story which proved to be a powerful literary tool that gave authenticity to the gaps that Krakauer filled.  I fell in love with how McCandless observed most people's lives as one of security inside the concrete jungle.  He thought most of us willingly sacrifice our soul for security.  Sanity only comes to McCandless in an endless nomadic life experiencing new things day by day, even if it comes at the cost of human relationships.  To McCandless, there is no better friend than is offered from Mother Nature.<br /><br />On the matter of sex, it was interesting that McCandless as well as many of his idols were not interested in the subject.  His sexual innocence was much like Thoreau and John Muir who sought the comfort of the loving arms of the outdoors instead of the warm arms of a lover.<br /><br />Krakauer took me as close to the mind and motivations of McCandless as anyone could, and I'm pretty sure he did it so well because they were made out of a very similar mold.  My attraction to trail ultra marathons brings me close to the beauty of nature mixed with the feeling of accomplishment of doing something substantial with my body but still within the realms of safety which is something I have not been able to ignore.<br /><br />This book let me come close to McCandless, to peer through his eyes while getting to know those who knew and loved him. The story is just as much about the love of spirit as it is about adventure and the controversy over respect for the elements.  I do not fault the young McCandless adventure and admire his strength to go at it without being fully prepared.  More power to him, it proved the purity of his heart.<br /><br />This book was a pleasure to read; pages almost turned by themself.  This one is highly recommended!able to ignore.<br /><br />This book let me come close to McCandless, to peer through his eyes while getting to know those who knew and loved him.

0061765236|2.0|I didn't like how Emily was closed off to Chris even though she loved him very much.  She should have let Chris know what happened to her in the Men's bathroom at least when they became a couple.  He would have been more understanding towards her when it came to the way she felt about sex.  I thought she was extremely selfish for not thinking of what would happen to Chris once she was gone.  The fact that she was so closed off and very selfish made me not like this book.

0871404133|4.0|There are any number of lively debates within evolutionary circles, such as the pace of evolutionary change (gradualism versus punctuated equilibrium) or the level at which evolution takes place (individual versus group versus multiple levels).<br /><br />One of these issues is joined in this volume.<br /><br />Wilson says that group selection was quite prominent in human evolution from 50,000 to 60,000 years ago. In his words (2012, p. 91):<br /><br />\\"Bands and communities of bands with better combinations of cultural innovations became more productive and better equipped for competition and war.  Their rivals either copied them or else were displaced and their territories taken. Thus group selection drove the evolution of culture.\\"<br /><br />A key concept in Wilson's book is \\"eusociality,\\" which refers to (2012, p. 17) \\"group members containing multiple generations and prone to perform altruistic acts as part of their division of labor.\\" He notes that humans and a number of social insects manifest this trait. Eusocial behavior is a product of both individual and group selection; since more eusocial groups would be likelier to survive, this introduces an element of group selection to the process.<br /><br />This volume has created considerable debate among evolutionary theorists. The volume is well written and worthy of discussion.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|We bought this so that we could catch up with the Showtime series which, at the time of this review being written, is in season two.  Made sense to buy the whole season, rather than rent each show individually.  We have Tivo and Cox so cannot get it via Showtime on demand.  We have been very happy with the quality of the shows - great purchase!
1469984202|5.0|WOOL is a provocative and thoughtful book about the nature of people.  I continue to think about it days after I finished reading it.  It held my interest and it really was hard to put down.  I miss the characters and I want to learn more about their lives.  What does Jules want for her people? and what can such a world provide?  The kindle book is more than worth its cost!!
B000P0J0A6|5.0|We decided we needed some movie classics at home & as part of a Halloween movie party.  Although Gremlins isn't a Halloween movie, we still included it.  It was a kid's party & they had never heard of Gremlins.  1)  We were amazed by how many classic movie lines are in this movie.  2)  I had also forgotten this movie was part of the Spielberg dream-team line-up.  No wonder it's a classic.  3)  My seven year old daughter thinks &#34;Magui&#34; the Gremlin looks like the &#34;Furbys&#34; that are popular right now.  So this might be a fun gift combo.  Enjoy!

B007SY3CEW|5.0|I love this game and games like it, but I hate the fact that the Kindle Fire can't register anything more than 2 touches than once, though can sort of deal eith that by &quot;rippling&quot; your touches. The audio is slightly out of sync, so your own internal sense of beat might throw you off. Maybe it would be best to have an actual piano track playing, which would cut out when you play a wrong note (and actually sound the wrong note) instead of just a MIDI track, kind of like Guitar Hero, it might sound more natural that way. It also might be good to add a free play mode, that let's play whatever or even go through the pieces without prompting or grading. It's still a great game, all considered.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It won't change your life, but it is a quick and easy read and certainly is clever and entertaining. Worth taking to the beach or on a plane.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great program. I wish I had time to say more, but the phone is ringing so I better answer it.............
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Apple makes things well.<br />Buy it if you need it specially if there is no wireless but have the RJ45, this is a life saver.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|This album is phenomenal. I'm a huge David Guetta fan and this album is pretty great. I listen to it everyday, superb album.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|stupid movie.  no action and horrible plot.  horrible acting.  will smith has lost it.  would not waste my time.  boring
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I love this album, Janelle Monae is absolutely exquisite. Her voice is remarkable and this is a wonderful album, highly recommend it!
B003VANOFY|5.0|As with most wireless devices, you can still use it while plugged in for charging. The charge cable unravels to be pretty long so that is not really a problem.<br /><br />The 7.1 is very good. I am no professional when it comes to audio but definitely worth the money.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man<br /><br />Great story and well written.  It commands your attention and keeps you thinking all the way through.
B0076HNCTQ|5.0|Rewatching this show after many years, and it's like visiting old friends--creepy, quirky, baffling friends.  My favorite part of the series is not the story so much as the surreal characters populating Twin Peaks and Lynch's sure hand in depicting each person's light and dark side.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Bought this for my daughter and it never worked.  Couldn't get it to load.  Fortunately it was free.  Thank you.
B008CP93S0|1.0|I hated this movie. It seemed to have every cliche in the book. I expected it to be very funny, with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd. It wasn't.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|I REALLY wanted to like this movie, but I was groaning 5 minutes into it. Hats off to RZA for trying, but his obvious  love for the source material blind sided him into making  a uninspired, cliche ridden, badly choreographed , waste of  a opportunity.  Worst movie I saw all year. Tai Chi Zero was mush more fun and a better hommage to films  RZA referenced. Too bad.[[ASIN:B009VL2A5M Tai Chi Zero.)

B002Y0TGOU|5.0|Of all the Star Trek movies, this is my favorite.  It gives background for the characters of the original TV series that brings them alive in the rest of the movies and TV series, whether it's as major characters, cameos, or as part of the script for other characters.
B001L51RQE|4.0|I recommend it to anyone that enjoys the police<br />and Sting's music. I gave it to my mom as a<br />birthday gift, I think she liked it.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|I chose the rating of 5 stars because this DVD brought back memories for me from when I myself fought my way through all of those thousands of people to see The Boss Ms. Ross. This was a memorable concert that Diana put all of her heart and soul into for the world to see, and feel. You can clearly see that Diana was very emotional herself when doing this show, and even though it was rained out on the first day she returned as promised to give a full show. I myself was there for both events, and can say that each day was a joy. On that first day as the rains poured down, Ms Ross controlled the crowd while standing in the torrential rains and I've never seen someone become more beautiful the wetter they became. It was surreal as she stood center stage, and looked as if she were a sorceress controlling the elements. All I can say is that if you weren't there, you've got to see it to appreciate it. You'll then understand more just who is The Boss.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|This is a great scifi series I recommend it to anyone<br />that likes this sort of things. To bad it only had 5<br />seasons.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I thought the story line was a good one for Scarpetta but the writing not as good. Hope the  writer takes a break and comes back to the earlier style of writing, which was so exciting.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show it has great character development, and I'm not opposed to a little gore either.  Rent it you will love it.
B008KE3960|4.0|I enjoy tower based games and this is a fun twist. I encountered a problem somewhere into the 3rd map the game will not load. I hope to find a fix, it's got me hooked.
0425263908|5.0|I was lucky to receive this book as a free first read on goodreads.com. This series has been compared to the Shades of Grey series for good reason.  In both, the hero is a gorgeous, extremely wealthy, driven, but emotionally damaged young man who had been physically and sexual abused as a child.  In this book, it has not been revealed what the trauma was.  In both books, the hero falls immediately and irrationally in lust with the heroine, a lovely, recent college grad starting her career. In this book the heroine is also a victim of sexual abuse as a child.  The plot is mostly about their attempts to build a relationship. Sexually explicit with coarse language, about half the book describes their sexual encounters. Days' writing wants you to keep turning the pages and get annoyed at your life when you have to put it down.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille is a great story teller. I like the characters but John Corey's wit and humor is a bit tiring at times. I am glad to see the developement of other characters from past novels and look forward to seeing them in future books.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|This is a fun game and very relaxing.  A good way to exercise ones memory skills and having fun while doing it.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This story was a great read. At first I was a little confused with the present/past of the story line but once I got the hang of it I really enjoyed the book. This was not a predictable story line. I didn't see the ending coming until I was upon it. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a little mystery.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|The four hour chef is just, everything. As others said 'chef' is a misnomer and really this a journey through Tim Ferriss's mind - which can be pretty interesting.  My only advise is don't give up if there is a few things you don't like about this book - there are nuggets of pure GOLD in this book that far outweigh the little nuances, which I'll break it down further.  But, overall this book gives a TON of VALUE for a low price.  I'll also preface this with I was not given an early copy of this, nor was I paid to write a review or anything like that.<br /><br />The book is broken down in this order:<br /><br />Intro<br /><br />Meta-Learning - This is where Tim breaks down how to learn everything. Some may glance over this to get straight to the cooking, but there are some useful advise in here.  I personally love the concept of the cheat-sheet.  It's basically a one-page note to highlight the most important things.  Also he shows how to identify different taste, which I am horrible at (I still think parsley taste like nothing).  He uses an acronym to describe the whole process of learning, but I'm not sure it makes it any easier to understand (DiSSS and CaFE).  Also, just to throw in more value he gives a list of links and videos on how to do random things like fold a shirt in 2 seconds, prepare for public speaking, and tying a tie (I found the last one most useful).  Again, he's just throwing everything at you.<br /><br />Domestic - The good stuff. This is the recipe section, learning to cook section, with full coverage on the best kitchen tools, dishware, ingredients.  I'll break it down here\\"<br /><br />  Equipment/Pantry Items: I loved this section. The stuff he recommends is really good, and he obviously put a lot of thought into this.  My personal faves which I bought were the Polder thermometer and the Maldon sea salt (which I now call crack salt).  Some other stuff I put on a Christmas wish list, because they just seem awesome (Aeropress coffee maker anyone?)<br /><br />  Recipes: (these are the ones I have made so far)<br /><br /> 1. Osu-Buko - This is the first recipe in the book, it's really easy to make, and it teaches braising.  Just a warning it uses lamb shanks which I find taste a little too \\"game-y.\\"  Also for being the first recipe, it can be difficult to find lamb shanks and he recommends cooking 4 of them.  I would buy maybe 1 or 2 at first just to see if you like it.<br /> 2. Scrambled Eggs w/ different spices - This section shows how to make scrambled eggs using different spice combinations.  Personally, I didn't like the taste of ground spices in my eggs, but the lesson here is to see how different spices combine to make a ethnic dish, which he shows an entire list of different countries and spices.  A useful chart.<br />  But here's a quick tip to make DAMN good eggs.  Use ghee to coat the pan, add the eggs, and use the 'garlic spatula' (garlic clove with a fork through it) to stir them. Don't forget the S&P. Delicious. Try it, then thank me.<br /> 3. Coconut Curry Mash - This recipe is delicious! Don't forget to add the cinnamon on top.  My mom is gluten-intolerant and she agreed this recipe is devine.<br /> 4. Union Square Zuccini - Also tried this recipe. Very good.  This is where he uses the garlic spatula - it's easy to make and makes a great appetizer. If you don't have the star peeler he recommends I used a regular vegetable peeler and it worked fine.<br /> 5. Sexy Time Steak - This is by far the BEST steak I've ever had.  So it took me a day of waiting to 'prep' the steak, but it's easily the best recipe in this book (I'm assuming).  Really, this recipe alone is worth the cost of this book.  Tip - I like it better with the Montreal Steak Seasoning, and I also bought the Polder digital thermometer he recommends which ensures it will cook incredibly accurately. I've already ensured my friends I will cook this for them (once my cooking skills get more up to par).<br /> 6. Eggocado - Another winner.This is an awesome appetizer that is a sure crowd pleaser.<br /> The next recipe I plan on making is the gazpacho which looks fantastic.<br /><br />The Wild - This part may be a turn-off to some, but this is where Tim shows how to hunt. And not just hunt, hunt ANYTHING.  He gives full reviews of the best of the best of what equipment/guns to use when entering 'the wild', how to make \\"acorn pancakes\\" (somehow they actually look delicious), and hunting big and small game. The most shocking part is he literally devotes an entire chapter on how to catch a pigeon and then dissect it for cooking.. I somehow lost my appetite.  Again, some will find immense value out of this chapter, others can pleasantly move on.<br /><br />The Scientist - There are some good 'lessons' in this chapter that some may pass up just because it's too \\"science-y.\\"  There is also a limit here since the ingredients he uses in this section you may have to buy online for some of them.  The two I've tried are the bacon-bourbon (yes bacon bourbon) and the chopping wine.  The chopping wine method really works and I ended up buying a wine aerator for a christmas gift.<br /><br />The Professional - More good stuff. And advanced stuff.  I am from Chicago and his writing on Alinea Restaurant made me really want to try it (not to mention yelp review are out of this world).  I haven't actually tried these recipes but some of them look pretty good and a little bizarre (cigar-infused tequilla hot chocolate..?)<br /><br />Appendix:  Again a lot of people will pass this up but there's more gold in this section.  Like how to shoot a three pointer and tricks to remember a deck of cards.  There's also tips on being \\"VIP\\" which I now always ask the waiter/waitress on what the most underrated dish on the menu for some new perspective.<br /><br />So that's it.  This is a massive book and there are good parts for everybody.  I'm reading it in the kindle format now, but I plan on buying the physical copy since it can be tedious to scroll page by page and try and find the right spot.<br /><br />One last awesome tip from the book - If you like to listen to music while cooking like I do, try Tim's tip of putting your cell phone on pandora/playlist and putting it in a metal mixing bowl - it will instantly sound 10x better.
B005LAIHSQ|2.0|It's a really beautiful, well-shot, grand looking movie. Truly fantastic. But some of the writing/situations are absurd. Snow is locked in a tower for years but looks like she's merely been out gardening -- some dirt smudges, newish clothes with sparkles, thin but not emaciated? And when she gets out, she's a little bit too much Sarah Connor, you know, for a young lady who has been locked up for the last ten years. And how nice of the Queen to have given Snow the jail cell with a fireplace. Also, it's Snow White -- black hair, alabaster skin?? Physically, that is just not Kristen Stewart. But that's not her fault. She just doesn't look that way and the producers/director did little to nothing to transform her into the proto-typical look of SW. Now the acting - Theron and Hemsworth are fine. In fact, I find Theron to overact in some scenes and as I watched the film, I could see why -- she was making up for Stewart. Not to drag on Kristen Stewart too much here - it's one of her best performances but it simply isn't good enough. She isn't pretty enough and she brings nothing to the role in terms of personal strength, resolve, inner-beauty - the qualities you expect Snow White to exude. What a shame because the technical aspects of the film are just stellar.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I give it four stars as it was a fun game.  I have already recommended it to some friends who like mystery puzzle games.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was so much fun.  There were no bugs or glitches. I found it challenging but not too hard.  I can't wait for the next part.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I gave it five stars as it was one of the best I have played in awhile.  This game was recommended to by a friend.  I played this game for four days and loved the bonus game at the end.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 2 of Walking Dead was just shy of terrible. In fact it was so bad IMHO I wasn't planing on watching Season 3. I am glad I stuck with it. Season 3 is terrific and I am glad they started culling the herd if you will.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|It is very simple. This is the stunning conclusion to one of, if not the most influential film trilogies of all time. Common complaints about this film include run-time and issues with certain plot/story elements, but those who are well-versed in the trilogy as a whole have no trouble (for the most part) delineating and identifying the reasons for these inclusions. Some people accuse Christopher Nolan of self-indulgence and excess regarding this film, I disagree, but even if it is true, does he not deserve the smallest amount of self-indulgence after the first two films he shared with us? This film is grand in scale, and anchored by powerhouse performances from a returning Christian Bale as a tortured Bruce Wayne, Anne Hathaway as the morally ambiguous (until the end) Selina Kyle, Michael Caine in his finest turn as Alfred, and Tom Hardy as the hulking monstrosity Bane. Hardy is a standout, and for those who insist on comparing his performance to Heath Ledger's legendary turn as the Joker; stop, the characters they played could hardly be more different. Heath Ledger's performance in TDK remains one of my favorite of all time, and deserving of his posthumous oscar. But one viewing of the sewer combat scene between batman and bane is enough to prove that this is a villain not to be trifled with, who threatens the dark knight in a powerful, physical way that the joker never could.
B009EP3C34|5.0|*4.5 Stars*<br /><br />Well whataya know? Kesha actually CAN sing, well sort of.<br /><br />It's been two years since the release of her 2010 EP \\"Cannibal\\", and in that waiting period Kesha ducked under the radar, going through a self-proclaimed spiritual journey to find new inspiration. She was also determined to finally knock down the accusations of her vocal talent (or lack thereof). Did it work? In a word, yes.<br />Perhaps Kesha and Christina Aguilera should have switched album titles, because while Aguilera's 2012 album \\"Lotus\\" mainly focused on being a fighter, \\"Warrior\\" focuses more on Kesha's own rebirth and new found cause to represent the misfits everywhere. The opening title tracks proudly exclaims: \\"We were born to break the doors down, fighting till the end. It's something inside of us, it's how we've always been\\" in a defiant chant. There's \\"Die Young\\" the album's lead single that holds influences from \\"Animal\\" and \\"Cannibal\\", but also steers towards a more tangible sound instead of drum-machines and auto-tune. In fact, auto-tune has been virtually abandoned, even though Kesha didn't abandon her musical parent Dr. Luke. His perfect pop production keeps the flow, but is now ready to let Kesha, the person, come to the forefront and not her hot mess public image. Instead, she's a little more put together, a little more cohesive and now has a musical ambition. As calculated and as pop-machined \\"Animal\\" and \\"Cannibal\\" were, they were a necessary move for Kesha. Now that she's gotten that out of her system, she now has a cause: to prove to the world she is a credible artist.<br /><br />Kesha may come across dumb, because she is nowhere near stupid. All of her own songs, and songs she's featured in, are HER creations, with the help of a couple other songwriters. She's sung back-up vocals for other prominent singers, she's worked with the best hit-makers in the music business, if there's anyone who knows how to make popular music, it's her. And \\"Warrior\\" proves she is one of the only artists who can not only add 70s rock and light pop/rock to her track list, but throws them in with her signature style and you ultimately wouldn't notice any change of pace. She will never be tasteful, that's for sure, but she's also continuing to stray away from being crude and is entering into taunting and teasing with the disgusting. She knows exactly what goes into making pop that is irresistible and at the same time is expanding her horizons to lean towards messages besides getting sleazy, partying all night and waking up in bathtubs. \\"Warrior\\" may not be as bright as the sun and fun music of \\"Animal\\", and it also may not be well-suited for the clubs like \\"Cannibal\\", but it's all the more compelling because of it. In \\"Wonderland\\", Kesha finally masters the challenge of a ballad (this is also proven in the deluxe version with her most raw vocal performance: \\"Last Goodbye\\"), in \\"Crazy Kids\\" she hits glory notes that no one ever would have thought she was capable of. She can't out-Whitney Whitney, but she can still crank out the hits like her. \\"Warrior\\" is the culmination of Kesha's spiritual journey, and this victory proves that we as an audience may not appreciate her as much as we should. It took eleven months, but this is the first pop album that's enjoyable all the way through.<br /><br />Like it or not, \\"Warrior\\" is the best pop album of 2012. Regardless of genre, it's still up there
B008WCP2PG|4.0|It was worth adding to my collection, but the movie plot was kind of lame. I watched it once, but I'll keep it in my collection for a rainy day.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|It is just a steamy romance novel.  Its good but not worth spending money on.<br />I have read other novels different names.  But pretty much the same concept
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another blockbuster! Gripping, fast paced, can't put it down read! How Flynn continues to write ahead of today's news headlines is beyond me but he is absolutely my favorite author of all time. No one is better at this genre. I not only reread his novels, but cannot wait for his next book. Mitch Rapp is a hero in fiction and I hope we have many such heroes in today's CIA.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's better than my old kindle touch because my tablet screen is much bigger and back-lit If you have4 a tablet you should consider installing it.
B0086213XW|1.0|This movie glamorized infidelity.  I strongly recommend anyone who is married not to see this movie or you'll be appalled as I was at how blase they were regards cheating.
B0046ZG2VG|2.0|im kind of disappointed in this film, it really wasnt worth the money. Save a lot of $ and buy the expired stuff, it still mostly works.
0141439807|4.0|Mansfield Park is one of Jane Austen's more serious novels. It tells of Fanny Price, who at the age of 10 was sent to live with her uncle, Sir Bertram (her family is very poor.) She found friendship only in Edmund, Sir Bertram's second son. Maria and Julia, her two cousins, have always meant well but been condescending, and the eldest son didn't have much to do with her. When Fanny is eighteen, the Crawfords, Henry and his sister Mary arrive. Henry is the epitome of a fickle young suitor, while Miss Crawford is trying to catch Edmund. Fanny, who is secretly loves Edmund, is forced to watch all of this.<br /><br />Mansfield Park is full of interesting character studies, and all of the characters are well-drawn. Unlike many people, I didn't hate Frank Churchill from Emma, and I didn't hate Henry Crawford either. He's just...well, fickle. Edmund was rather dull, but he is extremely kind.<br /><br />This definitely wasn't one of my favorite Jane Austen's. Pride and Prejudice and Emma I liked a lot more, though it was better than Persuasion and Northanger Abbey. I just have Sense and Sensibility (and Lady Susan) to go!<br /><br />The relationships between the characters were really interesting; I felt for Fanny a lot, when she is ignored by her cousins and excluded from outings. And at the beginning, when at the age of 10, she has to leave behind everyone she loves at home. Mansfield Park is less witty than Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but I did like it.<br /><br />My blog is located at novareviews.blogspot.com. Check it out!
B00AA7O22U|1.0|I am a fan of straight up mindless action. However, even this was too much for me. There was almost no point to the entire movie. No memorable dialogue. Nothing of interest whatsoever. I wouldn't watch it again if you paid me.
B007THA4FI|3.0|... enough said! I love JK Rowling, she writes humanity very well.  This book was a heart breaker for me ( and yes i have a bleeding heart :).  I loved her characters, and hated the ending.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for almost all my bible study for<br />about 3 weeks. The app pulls together a great variety of different studies from many sources. I am presently doing 7 of the studies, all at the ame time, and they more than meet my needs. Joyce Meyer., one of my favorite teachers has provided several studies. I recommend her Battlefield of the mind stdy as one you should try.<br /><br />You can choose from a variety of translations and change the translation any time you want. The app helps keep you up to date as it has a calendar. The app is free, a great price and easy to use. I note it did take me a couple tries, however, to figure it out. After that, it then became easy to use. I have had no trouble with it and I highly recommend this app for your bible study needs
B003G4W49C|5.0|When I started, I was absolutely unprepared for how addicted I would become to living in Ender's world. When I was at work I would think about Ender, anxious to get back to the story to immerse myself once again. I can see why these books are a cult phenomenon.<br /><br />Ender, while brilliant and sometimes savage, is a child-hero with whom we can all sympathize. Who among us has not felt like a misfit, full of self-doubt, thrust into circumstances beyond our control? The battle school is engrossing and frightening, the motives of the adults around Ender are suspect, the camraderie Ender experiences with his battle school friends is moving and the final battle is...well, you will just have to read it for yourself.<br /><br />It's a great read, akin to Hunger Games. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle expresses himself very clearly when teaching us how to live a peaceful life. How to quiet the constant &#34;chatter&#34; that goes on in our brain while accepting the &#34;chatter&#34; as being normal at the same time. He explains very succinctly how to develop the &#34;power of now&#34; within us and use this power to teach us that we are the &#34;now.&#34;<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in living a peaceful life without judgement against themselves or others.  In turn, Eckhart Tolle teaches us how to love ourselves and others in the most honest of ways.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Moonrise Kingdom is a classic. It will rise to the status of cult film easily. The actors are perfect, the story is interesting and odd, the direction is unique. When I saw it at the movies I sat there with a stunned smile on my face the entire time - I could not believe my good fortune at watching such a treasure.<br /><br />BUY IT. WATCH IT. LOVE IT.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love this app. I bought it for my Kindle Fire. It is easy to access and look up a word and you can still use it even if you don't have internet access to look up words! I give it five stars!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a real good series. We can't wait for each new episode to come out. We also love the high definition.
B003CSV7TK|4.0|Good casting! You can watch it over and over again.<br />Will recommend to friends and family.  Natalie is a born actress.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Other kids will like it IS gave it its rating because it was really funny and really good I did not have really any dislikes
B008NB0SQO|4.0|I read that this does not include \\"the love is gone\\" scene. I'm not going to buy it now. I'm very disappointed, I love that part. I have a dvd copy, it does have the part but only in the full-screen version not the widescreen, which is sad cuz the picture quality is so much better in the widescreen version. Why would you not include that on the blu ray. This is one of my favorites since I was a kid and I watch it every year. I really want the quality of the blu ray but not enough to sacrifice a wonderful scene.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like the game alot,  but I really wish you could use city credits to buy investment credits and energy credits.

B00540G3G6|5.0|We had the VHS of this, the blue ray is like seeing it in the theater again! Three D is great!
B009K45Y62|5.0|I went to the theater and watched The Dark Knight Rises five times. It is my favorite movie this year. Christopher Nolan is my favorite director, his Batman trilogy is the best trilogy ever. I love Batman because of him! There is no denying that Bane is not as amazing as the Joker, because Joker is just perfect. It's still a wonderful movie, the epic conclusion!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I almost put this book down after a few pages. I am a chick who does NOT like chick books and this had a very strong flavor of being one. Something made me go back and I am happy to say that the book definitely became more interesting. I think it would have been more suspenseful if the chapter titles in table of contents didn't give away a huge punch line. I'm surprised none of Mes Flynn's editors changed this. Anyway, the book is pretty good. If you are an avid reader of intelligently written suspense books though you will likely be disappointed.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I like this book a lot but apparently you can't lend it and it is expensive as far as Kindle books go. I am waiting to buy the next one because of this fact.
B009439HEY|4.0|Think of an old movie you've seen many times. The original director decides to redo it. He uses the same script, same props but hires new actors who say the same lines in a way (usually) very faithful to the original. The director might use a different camera angle here or there or some CGI that wasn't available 40 years ago, but only in service to the original. You watch the movie and notice very little different, but the images are crisper and here and there you realize that a slight change has been made.<br /><br />You leave the theater not having received any new cinematic revelation, but with an admiration for the director's craft and the actors' performances. And the next time the original comes around on Turner Classic or AMC, you'll probably watch it.<br /><br />That's how I'd describe Steve Hackett's \\"Genesis Revisited Volume II.\\"<br /><br />Others have waxed poetic about Hackett's artistry. While I take a back seat to no one in my admiration for his work, I'll keep my comments brief:<br /><br />1. \\"Ripples.\\" This is the only clunker in the set. Of all the singers Hackett could have chosen, he found a Stevie Nicks impersonator.<br /><br />2. \\"Dancing Out With the Moonlit NIght.\\" I love the \\"Greensleeves\\" intro. Has me hoping Hackett sneaks that song into one of his acoustic releases. Has there ever been another rock guitarist with his touch on the nylon string-classical guitar?<br /><br />3. \\"Horizons.\\" I found myself thinking \\"this has been done to death\\" on previous Hackett discs, but remembered that it precedes \\"Supper's Ready\\" on \\"Foxtrot.\\" Therefore, I consider it highly appropriate in this context.<br /><br />4. \\"The Lamia.\\" I agree with others that this song is one that is most improved over the original. Other candidates are \\"Can Utility ...\\" and \\"The Musical Box.\\"<br /><br />5. The singers. Hearing Mikael Akerfeldt and Steven Wilson on \\"Suppers Ready\\" and \\"Can Utility\\" is treat. John Wetton's turn on \\"Afterglow\\" is a highlight of the album. I foundSimon Collins' voice a bit strained and straining to listen to, but not a distraction. And as bad as Amanda Lehman sounds on \\"Ripples,\\" I think her vocals on \\"Shadow of the Hierophant\\" are just fine. Using multiple singers -- sometimes within one song -- ought to give listeners an appreciation for the original singers (Gabriel and Collins) who handled these by themselves.<br /><br />Why no five stars? Primarily because this is a remake -- an extremely well-executed one -- and not new music from Hackett. Die-hard Genesis and Hackett fans will pick this up. Some younger folk unfamiliar with these songs' first go-round might hear something new. But when reviewing Hackett, I tend to hold back on the five stars until he does something truly amazing, such as his \\"Tribute\\" album.<br /><br />It's a side note, but the packaging of this CD is very nice. The arty photo illustrations are beautiful and a far cry from the horrid cover art of the first Genesis Revisited CD.<br /><br />About the gaps between certain songs that some people report: I am wondering if these are heard on the CD itself or from \\"ripped\\" versions of the CD. MP3 and other compressed formats often manifest such gaps, which are not heard on the album from which they are ripped.

B000NYT1M6|4.0|I was very impressed with the overall quality of this toy.  It blows away 90% of the toys out their as far as what you get for the money.  Durable and well built, this toy line can take a pretty good beating from kids.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|This is the kind of book worth owning- the reason being is that once you finish it the first time, a person should wait 30 days, then read it again.  I know I missed much on the first read- there are layers of symbolism- yet too many things are happening simultaneously that you simply want to follow the story line and discover what happens to Shadow.  A very engaging book- the character descriptions are delightful.  The book is not for everyone- but if you are willing to expand your imagination, to consider that there are many things in heaven and earth which we do not know and cannot comprehend, that you are willing to broaden your acceptance of the slightly possible, then this book is a genuine treasure.  Glad I can include it in the library of my mind.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|a really cute movie.  my two daughters love it (2,4).  The grandma sloth is so funny,  Peaches is so sweet and the pirates are great.  definitely a great addition to movie collection
B0084U0IEG|3.0|This is a deeply disappointing novel. I had great expectations because I admired &#34;Atonement&#34;. I have seldom felt so sorry to have spent the time to read a book.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|All the elements of a great thriller. This is the fourth time I've read this book over the past 24 years. It just doesn't get old.
0307474259|5.0|This is a great book for those who are fighting the baddle of the bulge. I wished I had know this information years ago I would have lived a much healthier life.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Not going to spend alot of time on this but this book feels a littel formulaic like hes turning into another David Gemmel. Doesnt have the plot twists or storylines his other works had, especially the First Law series. I would recommend it though.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I love this movie and I now have it on DVD. I love watching all of the Christmas moves during the Holidays.

B003NFM3JK|5.0|This is a new movies to me but since I love watching all of the Christmas moves during the Holidays it's a wonderful addition to my collection.
B00AFEXRME|3.0|The title is a little misleading. This is a story about an alcoholic substance abuser (Denzel Washington as Whip Whitaker) who has yet to come to terms with his problem. The flight incident happens early in the film while the rest of the film documents Whip's denial of his problems. What muddies the water is that Whip, while drunk, is a better pilot than anyone is sober.<br /><br />John Goodman provided the comedy relief for the film. I wish there had been more of him in the film. Nadine Velazquez provides the full frontal nude scene at the beginning of the feature.<br /><br />Denzel Washington creates a good character, but the plot was weak. It wasn't a flight film. And as far as a man coming to terms with his alcoholism, it didn't exactly grab me. There was some questions involving Denzel's secular views vs. the religious views of those around him. The co-pilot's wife caused laughter believing the accident was God's will.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, nudity, no sex.
6305428042|5.0|I love this movie and I now have it on DVD. I love Halloween and truly enjoy having movies to watch during the month of October in preperation for Halloween.
034580404X|5.0|I bought the book for a friend of mine. They got to the address on time. Was no damage to the package or the books. My friend is already finished with the books though. To much time on his hands... So I will continue to buy books on Amazon. Great Job!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|Loved the Pillars of the Earth series even though they were years apart.  This one seems to lack the cohesive story line and jumps from character to character rather erratically.  Not sure all the random sex is necessary to the flow of the story..
1416955070|1.0|I was scared to mark this book with one star becuase of its hype!<br /><br />Seriously people? This book is obviously for very tender minds who will be more than happy reading a lot of senseless, endless and boring crap.<br /><br />Excuse me if you liked the book, okay? Don't take it personally.<br /><br />Where is the... the... nothing. This book has NOTHING in it to make it worth reading. And there is more than one? Whatever.<br /><br />I didn't finish it because I value my health and didn't want to end up with an ulcer :-)
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Must viewing for every American. Gripping drama. Superb acting, excellent writing. History comes alive in this DVD. I live in MA , south of Boston and after seeing this, my surroundings have taken on new meaning. If you are ever in the area, visit the Adams National Historical Park  in Quincy after watching this video.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Good fast moving story.  Wont spoil it with details.  I would recommend it if you like the Corey/Mayfield Duo.  Good Read/Listen.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has some crazy freakin' moments.  Twists and turns, tough decisions, Rick is a badass. People are more scary than walkers.
0060849827|5.0|Ive owned a few dozen books on bushcraft and survival, and I can say without a doubt that this and \\"The Ultimate Guide\\" by John & Geri McPherson are the best and most accurate there is. A few points:<br />-Illustrations are plentiful and good<br />-Worldwide applications, this bothers me about many of the books that are out there. This book covers damn near all of the continents, most only cover where the author has lived or had experience. Lost at sea? Check. Lost in the amazon? Check. Lost in the tundra of Canada? Check. And every where else too.<br />-Practical and simple methods? Yup its covered.<br />-Food, fire, climate, first aid, shelter, weather, dangers, tracks, traps, plant life, poisons, orientation, movement, signaling, knots, food preservation, cordage, strategies and natural disasters? Yup, and then some.<br />-Handy and small enough for a pocket, its slightly larger then a pack of cigarettes.<br />-Knives? Yup, and also how to sharpen, hold, use, choose, chop, cut, whittle and plenty more.<br /><br />This book goes with me every time I venture out, sometimes to kill boredom, sometimes just in case. It takes up practically no room, which means I am more apt to take it with me in and around camp. Ive built and used a good bit of the furniture, shelters, traps and whatnot in my backyard just to mess around. They all work and are not that difficult to do.<br />If you are into anything nature related or just want to have a good source of info to keep in the car, get this book.
B009A9BF5G|2.0|But he uses the F bomb one tomany times  I wish he could control his toying long enough for a clean concert for us that don't swear and don't want to listen to it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An amazing adventure on the surface, but beneath the surface lurks an awesome opportunity to assess oneself on a personal &#34;what if this happened to me&#34; basis.
6304681496|3.0|Even though we enjoyed the movie, towards the end, there were several &#34;glitches&#34; on the tape and we didn't know if we would be able to see the end of the movie.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I have really enjoyed the opening chapters of this book.  The Meta-Learning strategies really hit home for me.  I use some of those same techniques when designing lessons for my students.  Why didn't I think to analyze my own learning in the same way?  The recipes are great.  They are truly giving me a strong core set of cooking skills.  I have already made osso buko and the eggs (LOVE the mediterranean flavors, and want to try with fresh herbs to compare/contrast).  I recommend this to anyone like myself, a teacher that sometimes works 12 hours in a day (work doesn't end with the final school bell, believe it or not), and needs a way to learn cooking and recipes that are fast and replicable, oh and taste good.  Thank you, Tim Ferriss!
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|We loved this movie but is was a little scarier then we expected. A definate for older kids and the younger ones who can handle happy tales of zombies!!!
B009VB7QQA|3.0|I am glad I waited to watch this at home, but would have been very disappointed with it in the theater
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is in easy to play card game that resonds quickly to your taps. It keeps up with  your tempo and has functioned incredibly well. I could recommend this game to any card game lover. I have used this game for over a year on the Kindle Fire and have found it to be very reliable.

B008QMMEOE|5.0|I purchased this app for free and then upgraded to the paid version. My two year old loves this game and enjoys popping the bubbles when she solves the puzzle.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|This tale starts with a some style and promise then, about midway - after very little real entertainment - it looses what  'Oomph' it had and goes rapidly downhill from there.<br />Its alarming that the sellers would pitch it at the current pricing. Not worth it, frankly. Mr. Grishman can do better.
B00008J2R1|4.0|So let's get the bad out of the way first: Is it the greatest remaster of a classic album, the answer is NO. Why? Too spacy in some parts and I guess there are some parts not really taking advantage of the surround channels.<br /><br />It's still a good remaster mix and here's why: IT DOESN'T SOUND MUDDY ANYMORE!<br /><br />I love the album, but what always irritated me was the master of the 1995 cd. Just awful!<br /><br />EXAMPLE: \\"Some Might Say\\" was probably the biggest offender in that set-list. That song sounded so muddy and brick-walled; it had no dynamic range!<br /><br />The SACD 5.1 mix/stereo truly changes that experience. It sounds fresh, clean and PUNCHY without losing the unique characteristics that make up the song. Liam's vocals sounds clear, where as his vocals were sort of lost in the original mix. The guitar is sharper and the bass/drums are distinct, where as before everything sounded all blended in (just noisy).<br /><br />Conclusion: the remaster misses a few marks here and there, but overall this mix is the definite version I listen to when I want to hop back to those Morning Glory days.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A steady flow through events of the period, woven together by lives of the trilogy's inhabitants. Moved along efficiently by a skilled craftsman-writer, but it - or rather the central characters - lacked the octaine needed to lift it beyond the level of 'interesting' into the realm of 'reviting'.<br />Someone, in the the series, needs to take the lead and show the other blighters how to WIN. How to break through the contraints of history and live life on the edge. Bring more excitment to your dedicated readers.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|What a fantastic job they did with this movie.  The special effects were good and I was not disappointed.  They stayed with the theme of the Men in Black and warmed our hearts and gave us some real entertainment.  A movie for the whole family.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I always like concept albums, like 30 Seconds to Mars (self-titled). This one is about drugs, about one year in the life of Nikki Sixx. So each track represents one month, X'mas in Hell corresponds to December 1986 while Life After Death corresponds to December 1987.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|This is a great sounding pair of headphones for the money. The frequency response is fairly flat for headphones in this range with no objectionable distortion. They even look decent. The only issue I have with them is the fairly cheap vinyl ear pads, those may be worth replacing if you're going to be listening for long periods of time. I'd recommend them to anyone in the market for quality over-the ear headphones for music or as a cheaper, better quality gaming headset (with a microphone of course).
B0029LHW68|5.0|I love the part when they held the Summit to collect the sounds of Echelon. And I'm amazed by the ability of Echelon. I ain't got no favorite track from the album cuz I love all of them.
B00A7ZXDLQ|4.0|I am shocked at how much I like this album. I wasn't a huge fan of Talk that Talk so I think this is a nice comeback for me. I think I like it about as much as the Good Girl Gone Bad album. Numb, Pour it Up, What Now, Get it Over With, and Nobody's Business are my favorites. When I hear the song \\"What Now\\" I see someone doing a nice contemporary dance. Nobody's Business is a nice upbeat song with Chris Brown. This song is definitely letting us know that what they have going on between them is really none of our business, just theirs. This song also have a Michael Jackson vibe to it and I found out why. This song was inspired by Michael Jackson's song \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", which is one of my favorite MJ's songs. So yes, I actually give this album 4.25./5 stars! GO HEAD RI RI lol
1416511946|5.0|I bought this for &#34;the Heroin Diaries Soundstrack&#34; (album of Sixx:A.M.). Love those sick terrifying pictures. This book freaks you out starting from the first page.

B000002AGN|5.0|My whole family, including my 5 year-old son, love this album. Truly, one of the best jazz albums ever produced.
B008MG1E4A|1.0|The attack on Bin Laden's compound was good.  Unfortunately it is a small portion of the book.  The rest of the book reminds me of those WWII era movies where the star takes every opportunity (and I mean every opportunity)to utter some macho cliche.  Trying to out John Wayne-John Wayne goes from curious to amusing to tiresome.
0553801473|3.0|I, like many others, loved GRRM's first instalment, but agree and feel that the story dragged on after that in pointless or uninteresting sideplots and characters that seemed to go nowhere.<br /><br />Too MUCH intrigue and subtle backroom ploys and thoughts-inside-people's-heads...Not enough ACTION, not enough OTHERS, not enough Wall/Snow, Stark and Tyrion and too much Yunkai, Meereenese and Kraken plots for my taste.<br /><br />I honestly don't know how they will make interesting TV shows with this material... :(<br /><br />It was just too bloated, that said i still enjoyed reading all five books so far, one of the most enjoyable reads despite all my criticism.  Thank you GRRM for an epic story!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game makes you think it is easy, no challenge here, then it slaps you upside the head for getting bold!  The best puzzle game I have played in a while.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over.  A great love story.  You will laugh and cry.  One of my absolute favorites.  I had already watched several times before I bought it, but I knew I had to have it in my movie library.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|A great catalyst and thought provoking look into why people stall, ignore, procrastinate, and drag on to oblivion those thoughts and fears that make true meaning in our world.  If this doesn't get you going, then go back to ignoring your potential.  Onward!
B0076DELIG|2.0|the story is very involved but it moves so slowly. How Harry goes from one clue to the next is ingeneous but boring
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Kate Morton's writing is consistently great.  I recommend this and all her books.  This book is filled with story/character changing secrets.  You will love it too!
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I didn't know what to expect, but I liked this movie very much.  It's a great family movie.  I especially liked the humor, and the little brothers were very cute.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I read this because it was chosen for the book group to which I belong.  I probably would not have picked it, but as the story unfolds I was drawn into the streets of Barcelona and into the lives of the characters.  I recommend this for all those who love a good read!!
B009YP9L7U|2.0|I really liked the plot to the book, however, I found the dialogue extremely dull.  I almost quit at 40% but was determined to endure through it but at 60% I couldn't take it anymore.  The story just didn't flow very well and there was no chemistry between the characters.
0547884591|5.0|Tim's book is what he said he would be and met all my expectations. The book is well written and researched.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|This CD reminds me of earlier Dave Matthews.  I was a fan of Phillip's when he was on American Idol. I'm glad he released a CD while he was still fresh in people's minds.  I wish him the best of luck.
030758836X|4.0|Read this for our Book Club and everyone loved it!  just when you think you have it all figured out, there's a surprise twist.  Ending was a surprise.
B009FXIICK|5.0|It's a good time waster and keeps children occupied while you are off doing whatever you're doing. It does not charge for anything extra and I do not think it is reading any sensitive data. One of the funner game that I have played.
B003WUYP56|3.0|This is a complex subject but the author does tend to go on and on and on.  Make sure you have an intense interest in the state of modern physics or you will never get through this book.  Not saying it isn't a good book, just for special tastes.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Very impressive installment.  Can't wait for the next, so far RR hasn't let me down as so many authors before him have.
B00633W614|5.0|This book has many interesting characters but the way  Archer intertwins them is wonderful.  I can hardly wait until the last one comes out next spring.
B0038NN3B4|3.0|While this updated version of the Atkins plan is an improvement on the original, it is still too restrictive in food choices, especially for the \\"Induction\\" recommendations. In addition, even the \\"ongoing weight loss\\" recommendations are unnecessarily restrictive as well. This is because the information the plan provides does not take into account the numerous scientific studies indicating that the glycemic load (GL) of carbs is far more useful to consider than net carbs alone in a weight loss (or diabetic) diet. Consequently, using the GL of a food can allow you to eat often two or more times the quantities recommended in the Atkins induction and other phases. Using the GL of foods, instead of net carbs, will virtually eliminate any feelings of deprivation and produce comparable results.<br /><br />For just a few examples, an average sized tomato has net carbs of 4, but only a GL of 2, a half cup of chopped green bell peppers has net carbs of 2, but a GL of 1, 1 oz. of cashews has 7 net carbs, but a GL of 2, one cup of strawberry halves has net carbs of 9, but a GL of 3, a half cup of canned kidney beans has 14 net carbs, but a GL of 8.5. In other words, you can frequently double Atkins portions recommendations for many kinds of nutrient dense foods and experience greater eating satisfaction. (Look for Dr. Rob Thompson's books on Amazon for more information about GL. You may also want to explore this free site to reference a large group of foods with their estimated GL and other nutritional information: [...] (make sure you adjust the serving sizes to suit your needs)<br /><br />In sum, the Atkins plan is far better than any low-fat, low-calorie diet, or following the advice of the various \\"respected\\" health organizations. Along with the bureaucratically defined FDA food pyramid, they ignore the growing evidence from science that indicates that their recommendations are actually harmful to the health of insulin resistant individuals.<br /><br />If you are struggling with maintaining a healthy weight, there is a very good chance you may be or are becoming insulin resistant (an A1C test approaching 6 or better is an indication). You may then find that a low GL plan is much easier to follow to obtain the same results as Atkins. These results being to reduce the cravings caused by carbohydrate overloads, which cause you to overeat - quite often against your better judgment. When you lose the carb cravings there will no longer be a need to try to control your will power with hypnosis, affirmations, therapy, group meetings or drugs. You will simply not need them anymore, because you will remain calm during and between each meal and snack.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I've never listen fully to other Rihanna albums, but this one is great, I can't stop listening to it. its sexy cocky and fun, just how I like my music. plus I got it for 5.99 on black Friday, best deal there was that day

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this fun game for my kindle and it is free and fun and has one hundred and one games
B003V4AK8E|4.0|It's ok, but is not good as X-box controller. The battery has long life and the rubberized surface provides a good feeling. The analog buttons began to grab a bit after a long game.
B00846REIS|1.0|It was boring and unrealistic.  No one builds a relationship on sex alone.  It was disgusting in detail.  Supposedly<br />she was a smart girl with no money problems.  The plot was ridiculas.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I have had a Nook Color eReader for two years and I downloaded this app for free back when I first got it. I now have a Kindle Fire and was disappointed that when I opened PDF files they would not save automatically to my Docs. I'm glad to see that this particular PDF reader is available because it is easy to use, you can highlight, look up words, bookmark and pretty much anything else an eReader could do, except that this one doesn't have the option of signing PDF documents.
B005ZCXPP0|1.0|I actually hate this movie. I seen this movie in theaters and it was a complete waste of my time. I felt like it was rushed, the movies had little action, the story-line was terrible. I got bored and wanted to leave the theater. So happy I did not pay money to see this movie. I honestly don't understand why people gave this movie 5 Stars. Ridiculous. If I could give it no stars I would.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|The last book of Toms I bought I jumped in when I saw his name. Big mistake...it had a co author and the book stunk and got bad reviews when it had 50 reviews.  I not going to waste my time or money till the fat lady sings.<br /><br />I hope it's good but more reviews will tell. You can't fool smart readers but once.<br /><br />Dan in Rupert Ga.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am not a big fan of science fiction, but this novel kept appearing in my recommended list and all the great reviews made me give in when this edition was on sale for a 1.99.  Great series from start to finish, the first two are really novellas, but they suck you in.  I read through all the books within a day and couldn't put down my kindle.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Saw this at the movies and was set to buy the disk but not worth it if UV is the only digital option. The previous movie had iTunes download and my kids still watch it. We'll be skipping this purchase.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show has maximum suspense and great acting.  It is never predictable.  It has layered plotting and anything but conventional characters.
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|Some good action scenes but that's about it. The plot starts off well but then drags and has a very disappointing ending!
B00574Q7PQ|4.0|Very suspensful. Good story and fine acting. Worked for me. Most of the films Liam Neeson is in I find enjoyable. See it!
B00A2H9LK6|3.0|I so so so wanted to love this movie. I had such hopes.<br />My mistake.<br /><br />The first movie, with all its flaws, is better. Much better.<br /><br />I've played most of the games (1 & 2 are some of my favorite gaming experiences ever), and what I always enjoyed was the sense of mystery and the general atmosphere of fear and depression, and its the mystery that has stayed with me. Not any of the (few, vague) explanations. Also, like HP Lovecraft or David Lynch the \\"monsters\\", although supernatural were not your usual wolf-men or vampires or frankensteins monster; because that doesn't scare us anymore, and feels out of place in the world today, old-fashioned (you can still enjoy them, of course, just like you can enjoy the opera, or Michelangelo, or tap-dancing).<br /><br />Silent Hill's monsters (like in Lovecraft or Lynch) are so great because you cannot reduce them to \\"Look out! A vampire - I sure hope they brought some garlic!\\" But that was what the long and boring \\"explanation\\" did in the first Silent Hill movie. They tried to reduce all the mystery to one precise and explicit cause. But only at the end, after about 90 minutes of wonderful atmosphere. This movie does that from the very beginning (it has to, since it's a direct sequel). There is so much boring exposition.<br /><br />Everything else is also worse - I blame the writer/director: There are some great actors in this one (well, really only cameos - was Malcolm McDowell or Carrie-Anne Moss on set for more than one day?...), but they all give terrible flat performances. The story is not very coherent. The way different characters act, the choices they make, seems entirely to be so as to further the plot, but completely illogical in light of who these people are, or where they come from. The visuals are not bad, but the pacing, the framing, is a lot less interesting this time, and the set design is also less inspired. The music is pretty great, though.<br /><br />Maybe they wanted to stay true to the game? Maybe they felt people wouldn't like the movie if everything wasn't neatly explained and resolved by the end? What do I know? Maybe they were right about those things? (it's not like \\"Inland Empire\\" made a ton of money) I wish they had been more daring though, more willing to risk it, willing to make it stranger, more open to interpretation (is it all in her head??), less closure.<br /><br />There are a few good moments, some nice set pieces, a few good scares, sure. But it is such a wasted opportunity. I so love the idea of Silent Hill. I hope some day someone gets it right.<br /><br />EDIT: So I just watched it again yesterday, and although I still think this is a huge missed opportunity, going in this time, with a lot lower expectations (obviously) I actually enjoyed it more! It moves at a good pace, there's always something going on, the look of the film is cool (it is Silent Hill, after all), and I wasn't scared once, and nothing makes much sense, but I was entertained nonetheless!
B000UR9T8C|3.0|Spider-Man 3(2007) is considered the weakest of the Sam Raimi Spiderman movies, but it's still a solid superhero film. It has high production values, state-of-the-art special effects, and a good music score by Christopher Young(Young keeps some of Danny Elfman's Spiderman themes and motifs). Spiderman 3 does have too many subplots and characters crammed into one movie. The scenes with evil, ego-driven, emo-Peter Parker are campy and over the top. Spiderman rescues Gwen Stacy and he forgets to stop the out of control crane! Venom was hyped as the main villain, but he gets little screen time. The colors blue and black are flavored in many scenes. The film also uses a soap opera style cop out in order to give Harry Osbourne amnesia! Still, Spiderman 3 has some solid action scenes and I like the creepy screaming that comes from the black, slimy, alien symbiote.<br />There was a Mad Magazine spoof of Spiderman 3. It showed images of Spiderman saving Gwen Stacy and letting three people fall to their death! The film takes us back to the origin story where we find out that Flint Marko/Sandman was the real killer of Uncle Ben! Spiderman and Gwen Stacy spoof the upside down kiss from the first Spiderman movie. Spiderman 3 portrays its heroes as selfish and the villains as human. Director Sam Raimi left the Spiderman movies to work on horror movies such as Drag Me to Hell(2009). Spider-Man 3 has some flaws, but it's still a fun movie.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Looking at the pictures and reading some of the reviews, I thought this set was going to be encased in some sort of thin paper sleeve with nothing special inside.  Well, those premature reviewers were WRONG!  I received mine today and instantly went WOW! --all this for only $5 more dollars than the single DKR Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This discs are encased in a very simple but elegant shell and the art work is perfect in my opinion.  I wish I could put into words how the set feels, but I can't...you'll just have to trust me and buy it.  This set is NOT a money grab.  It's a quality product! There's a great little book and all-in-all the entire set looks fantastic.<br /><br />I haven't watched the films yet, but I can't imagine being disappointed in Blu-ray quality of three films I thoroughly enjoyed on the big screen.
B00000ICN5|5.0|i love to enjoy listen Stevie Ray Vaughan 's song,it is so amazing! i love it so much.i find it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thought this book was pretty good. It was a quick read with some unexpected parts. It wasn't the best book by Grisham and not his worst. Worth a read.
157330087X|5.0|i love to enjoy listen Stevie Ray Vaughan 's song,it is so amazing! i love it so much.i find it.
B005V4FJC4|2.0|Hoped for more<br /><br />Was very disappointed<br /><br />Acoustic mix doesn't work<br /><br />No wonder it was on the discount rack<br /><br />Don't buy
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Brave is a great movie if you're looking for an hour and a half of fun entertainment for adults and kids.  Filled with many light and funny moments as well as great sight gags the movie delivers for what many watchers are looking for.  The pace is quick and keeps you interested and while the story could have been a touch deeper the movie doesn't get too serious like so many animated films today.  Some of the moments with &#34;the bear&#34; can actually be a bit scary! I'd say while not perfect (hence the 4 stars) this little known movie is probably one of the best animated films Disney and Pixar have done in a long time.  Worth the watch!
B009B8YZIK|4.0|I must admit i was scared to watch this when i first heard about it but when i saw it i was very impressed by what i saw. cearly this (if i would guess is the first of possibly a three film trilogy) This was much better then the other movie that came out a while ago. We do get to see a certain hero from the video game and yes we do get to see him in action. Buy or at least rent this movie it is worth watching. Lets hope that they make the other films and conclude this story arc in at least two or three films if thats what they intend to do.
B00196YNWU|5.0|I loved this movie as a child and was excited to share with my daughter who loved it as well.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I loved this movie. I am so tired of the standard &#34;fairytails&#34; my daughter loves and this was really a good movie that showed a powerful little girl who is stubborn &  independant. Her personality gets her in trouble and saves her at the same time. A neat connection prevailed regarding the whole mother daughter connection. Funny, cute, and a good lesson.
B000001F7R|5.0|This is one of the first &#34;Albums&#34; that Def Leppard put out. The music is wonderful and the band is on their game for On Through the Night. A compliment for the Def Leppard fan.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Such an amazing voice and an amazing album. She is really incredible. if you like any of her songs, you'll love this album.
B000001E21|5.0|This disk was release in the mid 1990's. Def Leppard is at their best with Retro Active.  I love the music here.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I know this is a tween book or whatever and I'm a 31 year old women, but this is an incredibly entertaining book. If you're looking for a fun read, this is a good one. I LOVE that they use real photographs that were found at flea markets, etc. to inspire the characters and they bring them to life. It's very cool.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It gives a message that your connection has been lost or that sleep mode was enabled, but neither of them are true and you have to restart the game. This message ususally shows in the middle of a game so you loose your points/coins. Very frustrating!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I love this album. The entire thing is great. I listen to it all the way through and I'm not disappointed in any of the tracks.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Where to start??? Horrible acting, bad CGI(gunshots, explosions, etc), it's neverending. Jean Claude VD looks like he just got out of plastic surgery when he finally takes off his sunglasses.
B0082JYAZ2|1.0|I thought this album was terrible. I usually like her so I had high hopes. I got this on sale for 3.99 and wish i hadn't spent the money.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a nice easy read.  A few little twists and turns but a good book. If you enjoy a light read this is a good book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Pretty good. No glitches. But you do not have all of the elements and items that you would normally have
B0056CUZRA|4.0|This is an interesting with lots of historical information, from the main players in this war. Lots of characters whose stories interweave.
1572814136|5.0|I have collected tarot cards for years and especially like the Rider-Waite decks. This deck is really beautiful and the colors are brilliant. The price is reasonable as well.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I love this series.  I am invested in the characters and really like the variety of the story lines.  We don't have cable or satellite at home so when the next set of DVDs aren't released yet, it's like waiting for Christmas morning.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you like romance novels, you'll love this, has it all, romance, a bit of intrigue, sex, etc. etc.Completely caught me.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|My boyfriend suggested we watch these.  I had never seen them, and he had only seen a couple out of order, but was intrigued.  Since it was $9 when we ordered it, I bit.  We watched the whole season in a night (it is only 6 episodes).  But as soon as the last episode ended, I was on Amazon ordering season 2.  We are hooked.
B000FC2L1E|4.0|It is like a sophisticated (well written) Romance Novel. Great escape reading. The books in this series are long, but I like long books.
B00ABOTP0Q|4.0|I just received my EXCLUSIVE EDITION CD in the mail today (Thanks DAVIDA84) and I have to say I like it!  A lot Actually!  It's kinda like Uncle Cracker, but more country.  Kinda Like Trailor Choir or Gloriana w/o the girl(s).  It's Kinda like FUN COUNTRY HIPHOP ROCK BLUES!  Yeah that's it!  Not you're typical country bumpkin's!  I can listen to these guys!<br />If you want Fun Country...then these guys have it, much like Trailor Choir (w/a Girl) Buy this CD!  I did and like it!--which is coming from a Rock N Roll Fan (i.e. Ratt, Motley, Guns, Whitesnake...etc)  These Guys are worth the $20!
B0055SWM08|5.0|its not just finishing the levels, but finishing them efficiently, which is challenging. very well designed and fun. i recommend.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Fun has really outdone themselves with this one. The album never loses energy, and stays with strong stylistic choices the entire time. I can listen to this from the first to the last song and love every minute of it, which is certainly not something you can say about a lot of albums being released nowadays.
B006VGGAC4|5.0|I found it very interesting. I don't like fiction books so having good REAL stories in this book is awesome. I am not a real fan of Arnold but found the book intriguing none the less.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I think it is better than the first, More challenges and better explanations.<br />A very addictive game.  So be prepared for some late night activity.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|SHAME on the brain washed Judge jusry and executioner types that review it badly becasue of what they assume. People have no right. The book is fine nothing detrimental in it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|A really interesting book. I bought this knowing not what to expect because it was receiving lots of good reviews and was recommended by Tammara Webber (another author who is really talented). Slammed stands out in its genre as it manages to throw some surprises at the reader. I was not familiar with Slam poetry before reading this but apparently there is a group that does performs this in my home town. I guess my home town is more artsy than I had thought.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book and the characters. One of my favorite parts? The little brothers. They put a smile on my face an provided some nice comedic balance to the story. It can be an emotional read at times, but the angst is balanced well with the characters that give a breath of sunshine to the story (I'm looking at you Eddie and both little brothers).
0061743526|5.0|Atticus Finch is the best role model for a father of any novel I have ever read.  He is also the best role model for what a noble,decent and heroic human being would look like in every way that you would measure such a man. It is quite simply one of the most stirring, emotional and thought-provoking novels ever written.  And depicted, as seen through the eyes of his children, in brilliant, humorous and touching ways.<br /><br />This is a must read for all who have lost faith in the goodness of the human spirit. A spirit that will live on in literature in the man called Atticus Finch.
B002MG2ATY|5.0|Exactly as described.  It is a Christmas gift and I probably won't know much more about it until after Christmas.
B005PK1G76|5.0|I use this for my Baby Jogger City Mini Double stroller. It takes up one half of the handle bars. This product was MUCH cheaper than any of the comparable aftermarket products. I was honestly worried about the quality but it is very well made. The cupholders have held everything from a soda can to a 32 oz fountain drink. It fits securely on my stroller, and I can leave it on while folding it. Would buy again<br />UPDATE DECEMBER 2014:<br />I have used this stroller cupholder caddy for well over two years now. I have used it on four different stroller (umbrella, jogger, double, etc). I originally purchased it as a \\"budget item\\", but I have since tried several other more expensive competitors to this product (including the skip hop one), and I can honestly say this is the one I ALWAYS go back to. It has fit on every stroller I have tried. I even occasionally use it while grocery shopping so my drink doesn't spill! It's very easy to take off and reattach. I also have one that I attached to the top bunk of my boys' bunk bed. It works perfectly and he now has a place to put his water bottle, some tissues, a flashlight, etc. I always strongly recommend this cupholder to family, friends, and inquiring strangers. It is well made for the price. And since it is so economical it's affordable to replace it if it happens to get ruined. My favorite part is probably the wire around the opening. It allows me to easily place drinks inside, and I can usually do it one handed. That can't be said for the Skip Hop competitor to this product. While I appreciate the little zip off pouch and cute prints that company offers, this cupholder is just more functional. It may be basic, but sometimes the basics are best!
B009UMTMKS|5.0|I chose this book because I am starting a startup based on e-commerce so I wanted to know what are the basic things I had to consider to its development.<br /><br />It is really practical, objetive and well designed.<br /><br />I fully recomend it to rookie tech-entrepreneurs like me.
034580404X|5.0|So intriguing, I can't put it down. The author keeps you interested. The best romantic book I have read in a long time.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Ok so this game is fun BUT most of the stuff cost bling and you dont have a lot so you have to buy bling with real money or no houses or pets.... but its worth what it costs,well more... im a fan of LPS so i indeed will keep it! Ok so if yu dont mind then GET IT!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|A usual Vince Flynn did not disappoint this was a sensational book.  His books never fail to keep your attention.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This book could have been reduced to 300 pages or less.  I enjoyed the continuation of this  light and fun story but it seemed repetitive.  The same sex scene in different places was bad enough but then the same sex scene in the same places got very boring. I realize she had to make a point regarding Christian's transformation but ok already I get it.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|My wife and I have enjoyed this entire series and will be so sad when it is over.  If you enjoy Dexter, Lost and/or Homeland you will likely enjoy this as well.
B00A72989U|5.0|I like most of the songs and girl on fire is excellant.  Alicia Keys is at her best. I highly recommend it.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I really loved it! Hard but worth it. I really had to push myself at certain points but at the end it's a good workout.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|I would have given this a 5, but the sleeve is missing. Kind of disappointing. Everything seems to work fine.
0545265355|5.0|I read the first chapter of the first book and I was utterly captivated.  I normally purchase books electronically but this is so good, it belongs on my bookshelf.  Have the digital copy too. Probably the best book I ever read.  Climax at the end of every chapter.  After reading, I gave it to my husband and to my 10 year old daughter to read.  They both loved it.  Great book for adults, teens, and Tweens. Subject material too harsh for my 7 year old but she will love it in middle school. WARNING: very violent story including children killing other children but no sex or drugs or other mature themes. Read it first before giving it to a child under 12.
B006MOW98E|5.0|It's not the deepest, but that's okay, because I was looking for some fluff to get me into the holiday mood.  I picked it for John Green, but really enjoyed the first short story too.  The third was okay, although I couldn't relate as well with the protagonist, which probably made it a little less engaging for me.  The way the stories intertwine ends up being a really fun aspect as it unfolds.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|See my review for the trilogy.  I bought the kindle version, then bought the hardcover trilogy.  My entire household has read it except for my 1st grader.  Awesome book and trilogy.
B003NX75B8|4.0|I'll read anything by John Green.  This one is a little different, since he has a co-author, but I found the unique format with radically different POV styles actually very interesting.  The way the two storylines eventually come together is very well done.
B001F12J0C|5.0|I love all 3 titles.  Sometimes sequels fall flat but these movies just get better and better.  Matt Damon at his best!
B004A2V3K0|5.0|What can you say that hasn't been said? Bon Jovi rocks and if you want the big hits, this is the one to buy.
B0087GZ8YW|2.0|Standing in Another Man's Grave disappointed me because I think Ian Rankin made his hero seem too old and sort of out of place,making him look like if he was begging for a job.On top Shioban's attitude towards her old former boss was not at all in continuation with the way she was in the other books.After all he made her what she was now.I would expect more comprehension and respect because by now she should have been used to his odd and successful ways of doing things.<br />Bertrand Lewinson.
B00A77II0U|4.0|This was a fun and creepy way to spend an evening.  Worked well on my Kindle Fire and I enjoyed the different hidden object screens.  Some puzzles were harder to navigate, than I would like, but overall it was a well executed game.  I tend to like Alawar games, and this is one of their better efforts.
0553801473|2.0|I loved the series at first but it seems like he really started losing steam with feast. Disapointing to say the least b/c after the first two books i was thinking this was going to be one if my favorites. With that said it is still a worthy read.
B000M2SM92|4.0|I quite enjoyed this movie. I'm generally a heavy drama/action guy but this blend of laughter and soul-searching was highly enjoyable.
0316067938|5.0|Haven't gotten through the book yet, but happy with my purchase. Waiting to see the Part II of the movie.
B009FZFONO|5.0|we love this show, got hooked after 1st season. don't like the mid-season break until February though. we give it 5 stars
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I chose 5 stars because I really believe he visited heaven while in his coma.  For anyone afraid to die they should read this and get comfort from it.
0385344333|3.0|Jack Reacher is a man in trouble.<br /><br />It's not Jack at fault.  Lee Child, creator of among the most self-reliant giants of thriller-dom, is the culprit.  Child seems to have lost the spark for writing a series that until [[ASIN:0739378481 The Affair]] and now A WANTED MAN always delivered a rollicking good story and pulsating excitement.<br /><br />This outing boils down to Reacher hitching a ride to Virginia to meet Susan, getting picked up by a car filled with suspicious characters, then driving around Nebraska with a FBI agent, first searching for a missing woman, then a missing agent, then assaulting an abandoned military storehouse in Missouri.  Child gives us plenty of stilted dialogue, much more contrived than usual.  He provides an education in Nebraska's road grid system until we are loony with directions north, south, east, and west.  He supplies a blistering gun battle in a confusing labyrinth.  And he pads and pads to push the page count over 400.<br /><br />So why do I still give A WANTED MAN three stars.  Simple.  Even in a rambling wreck of a book like this, I like Jack Reacher.  I like his larger than life appearance; I like his brand of stubborn morality; I like his inventiveness; I like his nod to fear and his fearlessness; I like his nomadic qualities, living day to day, stripped to the bare essentials, that mainly being his folding toothbrush.  He is like no other, the ultimate American individualist, a cog that fell out of the wheel of the modern machine of conformity.<br /><br />So, three stars, if you're like me and you occasionally need to be like Jack Reacher, even if you're going nowhere in a giant circle of nonsense.  Otherwise, you may find the book boring.  If you want to enjoy Reacher in fine form, try any of the books from the beginning, among them [[ASIN:B0046F0PC8 Killing Floor]], [[ASIN:B003I05N7Y Die Trying]], [[ASIN:B000EPFVYQ Tripwire]], [[ASIN:B0000646QQ Running Blind]], and [[ASIN:0593046595 Echo Burning]].  The earliestadventures are the best, in my opinion.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Not as good as the first book, but it is still a well written, imaginative story that I highly recommend.
B009SIE6AA|5.0|Bougt this at a great price and since it is in our Amazon cloud we can download it onto all our devices.
0061474339|5.0|Lirael must walk deep into death to fulfill her duty as Remembrancer in this epic conclusion to the Abhorsen Trilogy. Sabriel and Lirael finally meet to take on the world's greatest threat: Orranis the Destroyer. And you thought Kerrigor was bad...<br /><br />\\"Abhorsen\\" begins to divulge the secrets of the past, but leaves much of the workings of the world to the imagination. Like a good horror movie, \\"Abhorsen\\" doesn't show you the monster in all its glory. The creature still lurks in the shadows, terrifyingly anonymous until the very end, and even then, the image is blurry. We fill in the gaps of our working description with hair-raising adjectives and blood-curdling images, hoping the truth doesn't even come close to our Lovecraftian ponderings.<br /><br />I continue to wonder about the nature of the Charter, the lives of the Wallmakers, and the fates of the characters when all is said and done. I wonder because I care. I have traveled all this way with a man, a woman, a dog, and a cat, come to know and love them, and now we must part ways. They will be adventuring in my mind for many years to come, and I will be sure to pre-order any Old Kingdom novel the future may bring.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|4 Stars, for girls at least, guys may find that there is no plot but I didn't mind at all!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I don't know if others are seeing the same problems on their HD tvs, but when I use the sub-title format... I am getting a video that switches btw full screen and widescreen ( with those two black bars on the top and bottom of the screen )..<br /><br />I don't know if that is a defect with the production of this movie onto disc..<br /><br />Anyone else see that same problem?
B0035JRVBO|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite movie's.  He mentioned he would like to have the movie so I decided to give to him as a gift.<br />The movie is a classic and the whole family can enjoy watching it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is amazing. Interesting, well-written. I stayed up nights reading because I couldn't put it down. Don't miss this one.
B007USWCXS|5.0|This film shows the best of the 'heart' of the French people under the onslaught of African immigration.  It is both beautiful in its atmospheric cinematography and classically well-acted as well.  A humble man with a very sick wife has the chance to rescue a wonderful young boy.  Well...the wife is too sick to know anything about what happens... but in this script her husband is superb in his humanity.  This is so different than the 'hip' and 'cynical' French films we are used to admiring!  I can't believe how often I plan to use 'superb' in this review.  The cinematographyand the sets are as evocative as any Francophile could wish.  The characters are 'true to life', not the least because this is a French film for a French audience.  The ensemble is beautiful, marvelous and genuinely heart-warming.  I have rarely seen a film as worthy of viewing as is this one.
B009NPM5Y2|1.0|It made us feel embarrassed for the actors. We were hoping it would be the good kind of bad, maybe campy, but it's not. It's boring and not entertaining in any way.
B006885LZM|2.0|Formulaic and full of cliches.... this is not band of brothers. It's saving grace is that it accurately outlines the timing of important battles in the pacific during the war and makes it feel more intimately tied to the people in combat rather than the generals pushing markers around a hexagonal grid.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|great gift ideas for my grand daughters. cant wait to watch this movie with them for the first time on Christmas
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I bought the book based current popularity and author's reputation.  It doesn't have a very coherent story line; rambles.  I was also interested based on the time period and the advertised subject matter.  I was disappointed on all counts.
B000V1Z8KK|3.0|Story was a bit far fetched for me. I could not imagine anything really happening like this. Acting was good.
1608870081|5.0|This book retails at B&N for $39.95. I found it here for $7.98!!!!  So happy! My daughter loves this book!
1451608659|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Such honesty and heart.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone.  Hurry and go read.  You won't be able to put it down.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|There was too much of the sarcastic humor in this one-it felt as if this character was stretched too thin
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferriss is one of the coolest guys on the planet. Cooking is something that I would like to learn, but the reason I bought the book was to learn more on Meta-learning. The ability to quickly acquire any skill fascinates me, and Tim delivers!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the best game ever I play this game all the time. I share this game with all my family. I told my mom and she cant stop playing this game
B004SCN2F6|1.0|Small game not much to do. Trading is near impossible. Not sure what is fun about it. Its a good idea but that's about it.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Live the Big Bang Theory. It is great to watch the relationships grow this season. Amy may well have her way with Sheldon yet!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|its an ok app its addicting I admit that but some stuff in the game I don't get like how can you jump over a train?!?!? its not possible and the characters are too expensive this app kind of reminds me of temple run so if you like temple run I would highly recommend this app.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|easy to learn. fun to play. works great. i play this game all the time. i like the fun sound effects. wish it generated coins faster but thats the challenge of the game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|IF YOU WANT TO SEE WHY OF THE 5 STAR RATING GO SIT AND WATCH.. EPIC SHOW AWESOME PLOT AND IM A TRUE FAN
B009LRE040|5.0|Could this be the last in the series, I think not. The way this ended leaves hope for a possible new entry.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has created a novel with intriguing characters and an intricate, twisting plot that reads like a movie script.
B009GEDP26|3.0|I am a big fan of both Stana and Nathan but, like any good show, I think they are close to the end of their lifespan.
B008LV05EG|5.0|She is young, beautiful and incredibly talented. I think she will be huge world wide. I can not wait for more music from Rita.
0525953728|5.0|Well worth the price, it came when it was promised and something that all Americans should read as it is an eye opening book
B0098VYCCE|2.0|I wanted to like this movie.  The cinematography, the sets and the costumes and the special effects were stunning.  The story is at least 200 years old and though told and retold, still has a lot of room for creativity and imagination.  Unfortunately at no point in the film did I care about anybody in it.<br /><br />The huntsman is as wooden as Keaneau Reeves, but not nearly as handsome.  He's also a stage four alcoholic and yet somehow manages to fight supernatural creatures.  Since he becomes Prince Charming, what's he going to do, get loaded and smack Snow White around?  He was getting sauced as he kissed her.<br /><br />Kristen Stewart --  The fairest in the land?  I don't know.  A pretty girl for sure and I guess the point is if the movie was interesting at all or her performance was at least good you wouldn't spend time thinking \\"Is she the best looking actress they could find?  In Hollywood?\\"<br /><br />The magic mirror was a whole load of CGI effects, but really didn't move the story forward or make you say \\"wow\\".  Actually it reminded me of when I did see similar effects and say \\"wow\\".  It was in Terminator 2, back in 1991, 21 years ago.<br /><br />I don't really know if I think the film strayed too much from the original fairy tail, or was too much a slave to it.  They introduced, I suppose, the exact wrong amount of new plot-lines.  It would have been a better movie if they either just stuck to the original story, or totally reimagined it.  Either stay on the beaten path or stay in the weeds, don't give me ten minutes of familiar story followed by ten minutes of weird detour over and over.<br /><br />What the heck was that scene with the troll, and why did they leave it in the movie?<br /><br />I don't know who gave Rupert Sanders the directing gig, but he must have naked pictures of somebody at the studio.<br /><br />All and all, it left me wishing I had not wasted the money renting this movie.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|A typical Crichton novel, easy to read.  Not one of his best books but it was enjoyable none the less.
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  The acting was top notch and the story true to her life.  I recommend this movie to anyone interested in Frida or Diego Rivera.  It would be a great teaching aid for high school or college students interested not just in her art, but also in the political, social  and economic climate of her time.  The movie keeps your interest by weaving you into her life's tragedies, triumphs and loves.  I highly recommend it.

B005V4FJC4|2.0|I bought this for my wife who is a big 'New Girl' fan.  It's okay, not great.  Zooey has a good voice but emotes very little on this CD.  There's no passion or feeling in the preformances.  The songs are pleasant enough just nothing really spectacular here.

B000EHQTZO|5.0|The Commentary Track is on the 2006 1-disc DVD issue of the original 1933 &quot;King Kong&quot;. The commentary was recorded while Peter Jackson's 2005 remake was in production, and the remake is mentioned a couple of times. Commentators are Ken Ralston and Ray Harryhausen. Ralston was one of the founders of Industrial Light &amp; Magic and has won 5 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects. Ray Harryhausen is the father of stop motion animation. He calls Willis O'Brien, the &quot;Chief Technician&quot; of &quot;King Kong&quot;, the grandfather of stop motion.<br /><br />The two introduce themselves at the beginning of the commentary, with Harryhausen saying &quot;We're both in love with the same picture, 'King Kong'!&quot; Ray, born in 1920, saw &quot;King Kong&quot; in 1933 at the fabled Grauman's Chinese Theater. O'Brien (O.B. as he and Ken call him) was his mentor. There are also a few places in the commentary track with inserts from archival interviews with Merian C. Cooper, director and co-producer, and Fay Wray, who, of course, played Ann Darrow, the beauty to Kong's beast.<br /><br />At one point, Merian says that the last line in the film was one he'd had in mind for many years: &quot;It was beauty killed the beast&quot;. And, in case you're wondering, he made up the &quot;Old Arabian Proverb&quot; at the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Both Ken and Ray are very complimentary to Max Steiner's great score. Harry: &quot;I can't stress [enough] how important music was to this film.&quot;  Ken: &quot;I remember hearing this, and it may be wrong, but technically, they had less ability to do a lot of levels of sound effects, and ... nuances like that. So for Steiner, he was adding a lot more musically to this. [Music] that took the place of what would now be the sound effects realm basically burying the music. This is like an opera piece, where you've got great music and visuals going through the whole piece.&quot;  Harry: &quot;And each character has their own leit motif ... It's just marvelous.&quot;<br /><br />I couldn't agree more. For example, it is a masterwork how Steiner's music builds the tension as the kidnapped Ann is kneeling in front of the giant gate, and then it opens and she is dragged through to the columns where she is tied. Then the music STOPS. The gong is struck. Then the music starts low, again, as you hear growling, then trees crashing, and then....<br /><br />But it's not just the music. I love the expert scene composition. When Kong beats his way through the giant gates, you see him from below, the torches lighting him up with his eyes blazing, while silhouettes of terrified villagers run towards you on your level. Great stuff!<br /><br />Ken reminds us: &quot;When this was released, this was their 'Jurassic Park'. When this came out, Kong blew everyone out of the theater, totally took them by surprise .... It raised the bar on visual effects.&quot; Merien adds: &quot;Willis O'Brien was a technical genius. In this picture, we had to invent 11 new processes [for visual effects]. This was the first time that rear projection was really ever used. There had been 2 or 3 [prior] tries at it.&quot;<br /><br />Then there was Ruth Rose's dialogue. As Ray says, &quot;You notice the dialogue is so tight. There's no superfluous inferences.... [The script] takes you by the hand from the depression era to the most outrageous fantasy.&quot;  This brings up the TV versions of &quot;King Kong&quot;. You must view the fully restored movie if all you've seen is the TV version. It wasn't just the censorship of scenes like Kong or the lagoon dinosaur chomping on the crew. They cut out huge swaths of the beginning of the movie, where the stage is set, where the characters are filled out, where the mystery starts to build, of, just what the heck is Carl Denham up to?<br /><br />I could go on and on about favorite comments in the commentary, but you get the idea. I loved this original &quot;King Kong&quot; before, but watching it through the eyes of Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston added to my enjoyment immensely.<br /><br />If you're interested, you can get many CD's of Max Steiner's film work. Probably his most famous soundtrack is for 1939 &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. Here's the CD of the 1933 &quot;King Kong&quot;<br />[[ASIN:B0007ACVK0 King Kong: The Complete 1933 Film Score]]<br /><br />I love Peter Jackson's &quot;King Kong&quot; - Jack Black and Naomi Watts took iconic characters and made them their own - but I will always have a place in my heart for the original &quot;King Kong&quot;.<br /><br />Happy Readerching it through the eyes of Ray Harryhausen and Ken Ralston added to my enjoyment immensely.<br /><br />If you're interested, you can get many CD's of Max Steiner's film work.

B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great book by Vince Flynn!!! I am already anticipating the next one!! Would love to see a movie with the character Mitch Rapp.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|I very much enjoy this game.  It reminds me of when I was a little girl and used to watch the Pac-Man cartoon on tv (I'm dating myself) and Atari and Pac-Man were all the rage. =) I even bought a totally retro (and AWESOME!) board game of Pac-Man from back in the early 80's that I remember playing as a child.<br /><br />My nephew also really loves this game, so kudos to something that will keep a 2 year old happily occupied.  He'll come up to me with my kindle and ask, &#34;Car??&#34; =)
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I ordered this movie to add to my entire harry potter set.  One day I will have a movie marathon with harry potter
B008S4FZHI|2.0|Only half way through and nothing has happened yet except for a lot of mention of types of coffee and what everyone is wearing.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|I'm glad I read the book before I watched the movie. The movie left a lot out since the book was so long. Best to read the book before you see the movie.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I hated the first book because I feel it had no real storyline to it because the whole book was about the same scenario. I was told to give the second book a shot and was glad I did because it is so much better and actually keeps me interested and wanting to keep reading.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I wondered how they could make a full movie from this book. They came up with a story that held my interest.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, based a first hand knowledge.  Quick read over two nights.  These men and women are the reson we as Americans can lay our heads down at night and sleep.  Knowing that there are soldiers doing more things to keep us safe, then we ever care to know about.
B00846REIS|5.0|Oh my goodness, where do I begin? Gideon comes on strong from the very beginning and doesn't disappoint the entire book. Sex scenes are sizzling! I didn't want it to end. Can't wait till the 3rd installment! For all the nay-sayers who are squealing that its a rip off of 50 shades of grey... there a ton of erotic bdsm books that i read that came out waaaay before 50 and anyone could say she ripped them off. While there are some similarities i.e.: broken man and hot steamy sex scenes, the differences far out way the similarities. I personally think this book is a little more realistic than 50! i like both books. It just gives me 2 rich young billionaires to swoon over instead of 1. HA!
B008CLI3TE|5.0|This is by far the best TV series I have ever watched. You will not be disappointed with this purchase :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great DVD. It's great to start from the beginning or to do as a supplement. Worth having in the arsenal!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book was good. Kind of jumped around a bit, but still a good book. The end gives a good in site to Christian's mind.
0920668372|1.0|I seriously thought this book was a joke or a parody... I'm very disturbed that its not. If an adult wants to read this for their own sentiment or attachment issues fine, but don't expose your children to it.<br /><br />Revision/addition to early review:  My children found the book (it was a gift) today and wanted me to read it to them - so I reread it now after reading one of the reviews that mentioned the authors traumatic loss that inspired the book. I can now see where the book comes from, and my heart goes out to the author. It is good he was able to do something productive with his grief. However, that doesn't make it a healthy book for children. It does however explain the disturbing vibe some of us get from it. The fact that the child is always asleep/immobile when the parents express their love is very sad (and then creepy when he becomes an adult).<br /><br />That is the opposite of unconditional love - as far as the book expresses the child is annoying when awake and the parent is never illustrated in the picture at that time. Again, I now understand where the author gets this detachment from the alive child, but  I want my children to know I love them awake AND asleep,  and that I won't be creeping into their room on all fours after they are asleep, or stalking them when they are adults.<br /><br />If you want to read a nice story about unconditional love - try \\"No Matter What\\" - yes, the child is represented as a fox, but he is alive and well and the parent fox hugs him even when he is awake, and the child fox hugs him back!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is great for any age, boy or girl. Its fun to unlock your fan favorite ponies and help out twilight with her friends in to beating Nightmare moon and save Ponyville.
B008DL466C|5.0|This album shows growth and is a easier listen then Rolling Papers; its a little more pop sounding than i would like, but i have yet to smoke one two it
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It took me a few weeks to decide whether to read Slammed. The description of slam poetry didn't appeal to me. Boy, am I glad I decided to go for it anyway.<br /><br />This book is full of love, challenge, heartbreak, and loss. Will and Layken's complicated relationship is so compelling, it quickly became a \\"just one more chapter!\\" read for me. Will is just perfect. I love him. :)<br /><br />There were times when I was frustrated with Lake... quit carving pumpkins! But her response to the challenges that were continually being thrown at her were understandable. Very realistic responses on her part.<br /><br />I immediately bought the follow-up book, Point of Retreat, the same day I finished Slammed. It was THAT good.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Easy to play and very addictive and free to download. My son loves it to and he is four and finds it easy to play.

B005FFW46S|5.0|Sir Pratchett has again woven a story that is more than enjoyable to read. There are times reading a book that you try to guess what's coming next but with pratchett i can really hit what he will come up with next. I marvel at his imagination and love it
B003CSV7TK|5.0|it always brings out the spirit in me.it's heart-warming and the message is clear.it's one of the best movies for the holidays next to &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;
0060786523|5.0|I read \\"A Suitable Boy\\" when it first came out and declared it one of my favorite books ever. I just reread it, and it is still one of my favorite books ever.<br /><br />As I turned the final page I wished again that the story of the Mehra, Chatterji, Khan, Khanna, & Kapoor families would go on. I had so many questions! I wanted to know so many outcomes! And now I see a thread that says that Vikram Seth is working on a sequel, due out in 2013. It is hard to move on to anything else after having been so completely engrossed in this novel. I simply cannot wait.<br /><br />If you have not read this book, a treat awaits you. Get cracking.<br /><br />Oh, and Vikram? A glossary would be great.
B009B2VBWE|2.0|I love Diana Krall and have most of her albums, but I gotta say the production and sound on this album just sucks.  Thump thump buzz rattle.  C'mon man!  Diana is not a bluegrass player or singer.  She is a great jazz artist and her sound on this venture is buried under an avalanche of low-end distortion.
B007D15N1K|5.0|I knew A.S.Byatt through her previous work. This is very good and complex as it mixes two different centuries characters
B007HACDLK|5.0|Excellent sequel to previous ones but some gaps in character and group development - where did it ever say that Scott Coleman, etc. were an official group with Mitch as the leader?  Not a big deal but for those who have followed all the books, a bit of a jump from place to place
0316228532|4.0|Once you get past the fact that it's not Harry Potter, or the detective story suggested in the early publicity, it's quite a good book. This is, definitely, a bleaker world than that of Harry Potter. The adults are highly imperfect, even the good ones, and the bad ones are kin to the Dursleys and Cornelius Fudge. The natural world, to the extent it's present at all, is under attack, and drugs abound.  Nevertheless,it's a story of how the most unpromising looking adolescents can be interesting and lovable and even good.This is not all that common with any writer, but English writers, in particular, tend to come down pretty hard on the young. Rowling's sympathies and gifts with respect to adolescents, so evident in the Harry Potter books, do continue here<br />But I'm not sure the book she ended up writing is the book she started out on.
B004I744AS|5.0|the stock kindle dictionary is about unusable on its own ( open it &amp; just try to look up a word sometime) .....this dictionary is easy to search and has fun extras.....

B001MEJY8W|4.0|When I was introduced to this movie the person doing thought I was going to hate or at least not like it.  The truth is I loved this movie and the only reason I didnt give it a 5 star review is becouse I felt like I wanted more at the ending kind of like there was something missing
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Big Alien franchise fan and this movie does an amazing job of telling us how the story begins before Alien.
B00008EQ4U|5.0|I love Roy Orbison and must say that this is the BEST CD I've ever had. the DVD is the best too. Love all the ones doing back up and especially k.d.lang. I loved her on &#34;Crying&#34; with Roy and loved her on this &#34;Black and White Night&#34;. You won't be disappointed with this one.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Since iPads and, in my case, my Samsung S3 have touch screens designed to be moved around with the fingers, one might wonder why even bother with a stylus. In my case, I use Swype which which requires intricate sliding on my keyboard. Same for people who draw on their tablets and phones. That being said, the Cosmonaut is my 8th stylus. My collection includes Boxwave, Kensington, AYL, Gogo, a no-namer, and 2 Alupens. Of those, my favorites have been the Alupens.<br /><br />I've known about the Cosmonaut and its Kickstarter origins for close to a year.<br /><br />When I saw the Cosmonaut on Amazon, I immediately snagged one for myself. Being a longtime Alupen user, I was anxious to compare to what I considered to be the gold standard in styluses. Well, I got it yesterday, and it has exceeded my wildest expectations. The feel and useability is tuned to perfection and the feel in your hand is hard to describe. You've got to try it for yourself. Somehow, in spite of the Cosmo's clunky, chunky appearance, it's shape and width, and non-slip grip lend itself to more accurate Swyping. I felt at home with it from the get-go.<br /><br />All in all, the Cosmo and my Alupens are my top favorite go-to stylus. They all glide effortlessly. I have two stylus that use the fabric instead of rubber. They're good, but I tend to hear a squeaking sound when using them.  The Cosmo has a slight edge because, it doesn't slip out of your hand. But it's width makes it a little less portable than the Allpen.<br /><br />$25 bucks for a stylus? Yes...and I'd readily buy another one of these.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I love the Vampire Diaries!  It is a completely addictive series.  I just hope Elena gets with Damon in season 4.  Love it!

B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Rihanna is like a budding flower at this point in her career. The first set of songs are kinda pop-urbanish and its great. The last half of the songs are mostly ballads, and if you've been following Rihanna's vocals, you will notice how much her voice has improved. I'm so excited for her, this is my favorite Rihanna album that I've bought since Rated R.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a superb book from beginning to end. From the opening chapter to the final paragraph. If you have ever served in the military you will recognize this mans account. With so much garbage from Hollywood and politicians it is refreshing to read an honest no nonsense account from one of this nations finest. Highly recommended.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|THe Dark Knight Rises is my TOP favorite movie, and deserves a 5/5 in any review given!!!! It is filled with awesome action scenes while maintaining an excellent story line. This movie was a great way to end the trilogy of Christopher Nolan's Batman franchise in a touching, exciting, and satisfying manner. It was definitely the best movie of the Dark Knight Trilogy, which makes this movie \\"The Best Of The Best\\" or ELITE! =) To wrap it up in Barney's words, \\" The Dark Knight Rises is Legen...wait for it............DARY!!!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Great show. Amazon brings it when I want it where I want it.<br /><br />Only complaint was I had to refresh the page in order to get the video to stream in HD. Most likely is a problem on my end. Will try again when I settle down to watch the next episode.

B005MHI0QM|5.0|Love the entire book! Love it because it's the real diary with nothing left out. U can really live through Anne's mind at the worst time in History for Jews.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|Written my Tarantino this film is one of my favorites and my favorites of his. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are excellent in it, it's a fun, very 90's wild romp! It'll make you want to go on a road trip and talk in a Southern accent. Oh - and do it in a phone booth.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I had a hard time putting this book down, and I was very intrigued by the characters. Pat's story is great and I spent the whole book waiting to find out what happened to Pat to put him into the hospital. I was a little disappointed at the lack of explanation into Pat's past. Most of the book lead up to the crucial point in Pat's life and it was such a letdown that the author spent very little time explaining his situation.<br /><br />On that note I still loved the book, I would recommend it to anyone. I really enjoyed learning about Pat and his family and liked the dynamics. I feel like to book was a real glimpse into to how most families would handle a similar situation. I would definitely give this book 4 stars out of 5.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|This film was pretty cool for the most part, very polished and great production design, I kinda like the &#34;little kid who acts like an adult&#34; angle, but it was just a little &#34;too cutesy&#34; to me - it was like someone's thesis film that was made longer and had more money thrown at it.
B009CGR416|4.0|Scott Pilgrim is a quirky, nerdy movie about the awkwardness of being a dork, woven into a badass story of conquest of his love through vanquishing her Evil Exes. Great music. The on screen graphics give it a unique flair. To conclude, what can I say but &#34;We are Sex Bob-bomb, 1-2-3-4!&#34;
B0012HRJEA|5.0|Um okay who remembers being a grade seven girl and being ridiculously obsessed with Leo and this movie? Slumber party Leo movie marathon anyone? Honestly I continue to view this film through my junior school eyes, so I really don't have any objectivity in this review haha. It's awesome and fast paced with just the right amount of 90's emo.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|There are many other excellent reviews that detail how horrible this book was. Fans will say that erotic literature is not supposed to be well written. To them, I say &#34;erotic literature is supposed to make you feel erotic...This made me want to shower&#34;. Ana would be more unlikable if I wasn't aware of her overwhelming mental illness. Surely someone who's head is occupied by multiple entities and exhibits weird, paranoid, narcissistic behavior should be granted a few free passes when they're not taking any meds. Christian is your classic creepy stalker whom you expect to be hiding dead bodies in their closet. In this third and final installation, Ana and Christian get their happily ever after which to the rest of us sounds like a living hell (imagine living with either one of them). Additionally, they decide to procreate thus eliciting the attention of CPS in their region (we hope).
B004RL9T50|4.0|I'm not that into cartoons usually, but I do love comedies so I thought I'd give this film a whirl. It's really well written and it's a great story. Will Ferrell and Tina Fey are awesome in it. It's one of those animation films that you can watch with kids, but you as an adult will still enjoy it.
B006BAEQB2|4.0|I found Anne to be a reasonably likable protagonist and found their story to be very interesting. However, from a narrative perspective, the book lost much of its charm near the end and by that point Anne's hatred for Elizabeth Grey was a little redundant and overly mentioned.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very enjoyable. Hated to put it down. I look forward to now watching the movie, then on to the next book.
B000I62JAK|5.0|This is a hilarious movie that makes fun of the fashion industry. Ben Stiller is great in it and I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a bit of juvenile humor and doesn't mind something silly.
630460291X|5.0|Great movie for fun viewing!  The CD arrived in good condition as promised.  If you like fun, well made adventure movies, give it a try.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book is the final and darkest in the Hunger Games series. I think the author added too many things for shock value and the end was a bit rushed and contrived. I wanted to learn more about Katniss and Peeta's future as well as the futures of others. Finally, I regret the fact that the author brought a huge element of mental illness into this version. I thought that was very insensitive and also forced her to miss out on an ending where the main characters are actually contributing to society, not living on its edges. Overall, a disappointing end to what could have been a phenomenal series.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Seems to work well, is easy to use, and offers several varieties of play.  Would suggest that next edition has an exit button for ease of exit when events require immediate ending of play.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was terrible. I get that it's a ripoff of twilight, but sadly it makes Twilight seem brilliant. I don't understand how people are getting off on this stuff. There are so many issues with it. The poor writing, the terrible sex scenes, the creepy childlike protagonist, the abusive boyfriend. This was so so horrible. EL James, you should be ashamed of yourself.
B0016K40KY|5.0|Film and background provided on the DVD was of the highest quality.<br />Wil recomended this DVD to my friends and relatives.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read Hunger Games and watched the movie and very much enjoyed them. Catching fire is a basically an expansion into the Hunger Games universe and while I certainly enjoyed those aspects of it, I got a bit tired of the Gale-Peeta-Katniss love triangle as well as the darker tone this book took. It makes for a great plane read but it didn't quite have the same magic of Hunger Games.
B005DJGMQE|5.0|This movie was very well done. I was skeptical at first but it was a very clean yet clenching depiction of the assassination plot.
B002KANXXE|5.0|I like the kindle version of this book. As far as books go, this is one of my favorites and I like the fact that it discusses second chances. It's beautifully written and the main character is sympathetic without being tragic. I highly recommend this to other Austen fans.
B007V65R54|5.0|This is an important book, but it's fun, too. Nate Silver obviously spends a lot of time thinking about what we know and don't know about why things happen. He shows why making predictions and testing them is crucial to increasing our knowledge. Many of the chapters would be enjoyable magazine articles on their own.
B00742BVW8|5.0|I know this film is basically a Chinese propaganda movie, but then so is Lagaan in India and pretty much every WWII movie for the US, so it seems unfair to criticize a film for that as some other reviewers have done. This movie was visually stunning with a beautiful and complex storyline. I think it makes a great date movie since there's a bit everything (except humor) for everyone.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The packaging was beautiful and the booklet was amazing. Zero problems with the picture quality and audio, no a bad deal for the price!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The series continues with a second and worse book in which our protagonist vacillates between utter stupidity and angst as well as focuses on inconsequential details while talking like a child from the 50s (jeez, double crap!). I found my inner goddess attempting to commit suicide while reading this book and would not recommend this to anyone with a functioning brain or self esteem.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|First of all, let's talk about the book cover: Is that a girl or boy on the cover? Take a moment to look at it.<br /><br />Odds are you're thinking about his man-hands. However, the truth in the matter is, that that man is a wo-man. Yeah...<br /><br />Anyway, I don't buy books often. Okay: I try not to buy books often. Sometimes I buy books when I don't really have any money because (not necessarily in the order of reasons I'm most passionate about) 1) I love supporting the work of great authors; 2) I love the smell, the feel, and the look of a new book; and 3) I love sharing great books by lending them to friends.<br /><br />Sabriel, the first book in the Abhorsen Series by Australian author Garth Nix, is a book I will without-a-doubt purchase.<br /><br />Sabriel isn't about Sabriel, the 18-year-old female protagonist, journeying into the afterlife to save her dead father from, well, death, by bring him back to, well, life. I thought it might be. Not really though. Sabriel only goes into Death a handful or two handfuls of times in the book. Most of the time is spent in this raw, broken country called the \\"Old Kingdom,\\" as Sabriel and her companions are chased by the Dead (what we would call \\"zombies\\") and an unspeakable evil that is trying to manifest itself again in the world of the living.<br /><br />I thought the main character Sabriel was okay. Definitely one of the best female heoines. I just had difficulty relating to her. However, I liked Mogget, the \\"cat,\\" and his smugness best. Touchstone made me laugh, even though I don't think some of the parts he was highlighted in, such as his crazy-rage parts, were meant to be humorous.<br /><br />The world-building in Sabriel is fantastic and the ideas in it are unlike anything I've ever read.<br /><br />Sabriel's world is made up of two completely different places: Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre. Think of Ancelstierre as similar to our own world, with perhaps a pinch of World War Two England in it: electricity, modern-ish weaponry, boarding schools. Then Ancelstierre is like some rouge, war-torn country, with Free, lawless magic. Ancelstierre and Old Kingdom are right next to each other, the only thing separating them from one another is a wall and a second-rate army on the Ancelstierre side. Cool world, right? Taking gated communities to a whole new level.<br /><br />More on the world: there's Gore Crows, which are basically zombie crows; Mordicants, beasts made of human blood, moulded bog mud, and magic freakin' blasts out of their mouths and drip from their claws (aka: awesome); and Mordaut, which are parasitic zombies. Of course there's more, but those are my favorites.-ish weaponry, boarding schools. Then Ancelstierre is like some rouge, war-torn country, with Free, lawless magic.

B006VAC1YG|5.0|High quality printing throughout, few grammatical errors, great story hilarious! If you have ever read catch 22 and loved it this is the book for you. Funny series of events, great writing, great characters. Unfortunately it's based in london with london characters and english writers, you may have to look up some of the jokes/references.<br /><br />This is definitely one of my favourite (pun intended) books of all time~<br /><br />I got the one with crowley (the demon) on the cover because it looks nicer BTW
B005WUHAX8|5.0|it was just what it said it was, it was cute and I will enjoy using it very much thanks
B002VL4OC6|4.0|This thing was written in, like, the 20's and is a real head ache to read through. It's like you need google translator to go from victorian english to modern day english.<br /><br />But that's not all that this book is about, it has tons of good anatomy drawings in it that really break down the human body and every part of it very well. It has rough sketches, full human figures, quick poses, multi-layer cros sections with bone meat and skin. Some of the drawings are so loose and quick that it's hard to tell what it was the artist was drawing but generally I found it helpful.<br /><br />One thing I wish this book gave me was some pointers on the approach to drawing each body part. Like what are good guiding lines and what proportions should I be paying attention too? Instead it just has mostly complete drawings so I turned to deviantart to find different starter schema.
B00884GR0W|2.0|I can not get it to work on my kindle fire it keeps crashing! I will never even get one block without it crashing and a new freaking update came out this year please unglitch this. If mind blocks were to unglitch this I would definatly rate it higher.
0061906220|3.0|I expected more from the story in this book.  I ordered this for my 2 year old niece who loves cats.  The overall story is okay (incorporating learning colors), but the ending seems rushed or not well thought out.  Maybe she will like it but I was surprised at how abruptly it ends compared to similar children stories.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Well done; entertaining. The show was provocative, produced well and an interesting taking on the subject. I look forward to more episodes.
B007RRFUHM|2.0|alright, so i was stoked to get this and I got the mp3 album from amazonmp3 for a steal at some point this year. However, upon listening i was a bit underwhelmed by it. So putting my \\"i want to like this\\" hat on i listened, and listened again. Still, i was underwhelmed EXCEPT for the bonus track \\"Warrior\\". That track is a great sugary coated near 80's infused dance gem. Kimbra sounds like she's paying homage to Kate Bush on that track as well, which is a splendid gift indeed!. Reasons i didnt like the rest so much? Like alot of people have said, the production of this is strangely odd. It almost sounds like someone fell asleep in front of pro tools during the master stage. Some of the low end bass is muddy and the high end is on the verge of crackling out, leaving all the subtle nuances and neat little \\"artsy-gotye\\" type embellishments lost in the wash. The sequence of the tracks truly muddles down the pace of the album as well. We go from 60's style warbling and crooning to late 90's style r&b with and artsy approach, and things just start getting stale after that. I understand she's still trying to find her footing and dabbling around, but as a coheasive album, this doesn't work very well. I hope her next one is better and more \\"warrior\\" esque. lol
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|fun game with a variety of puzzles...freezes sometimes and sometimes the buttons dont always work. also a lot of ads
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Nolan does an excellent job with his conclusion to the trilogy. Theres a lot going on in the movie and everything comes together in the ending.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|bought this movie, and it came on time. in great condition. i absolutely love this movie and it reminds me of when i was a little girl
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Could have used a little more character development.  Story dragged in places.  Just average Grisham, but that is still pretty good.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show!! I love how suspenseful it is every episode! It always keeps me on the edge of my seat!
B005BCE7II|5.0|I can't belive how hard my kid laft at this movie he just keeps on watching and watching it's amazing
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Adobe Reader is judged by a different standard than other apps because it is already established independently of appdom and the expectations are so high. But it merits a 5 star rating in actual comparison with competing pdf apps.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Only negative critique is that some parts of the plot were hard to believe (far fetched).  Overall, an outstanding read
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This did not work on my Kindle not sure why.  I may fl it again and try touseit. Three stars because maybe it was me.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After all the hype I expected to be disappointed, but it was better than I expected. I'll definitely read them all.
B00AFHC1TQ|5.0|a great book , sad and un demanding do not start The Lovely Bones unless you can finish it and understand the horrors of i
B000069AUI|1.0|I returned this item as it was defective with skips in it.  I noticed that the CD did not have the seal on top, the part that makes CDs hard to open.  Amazon returns was easy and I was credited promptly upon the products return.  Thanks.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was refered to me by a friend that had just read Fifty shades of Gray.  Quite similar in context.  Would recommend it to a friend also.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Wow - This book is amazing, kept me in it the whole way till the end!! I have recommended to many!
B0064W65UM|3.0|I read this after seeing the movie so generally I like the first versions of something, songs, movies, etc, and this was the case with V.  I really liked the movie but the graphic novel kept losing me.  I had trouble keeping up with the supporting characters. I don't really know if it was the writing that lost me as they just showed up from out of nowhere or the art when I couldn't really distinguish one from another at times.  Whatever the case, I got lost several times.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love the show and this game is also great! the only thing is that if u want to play the game faster u have to purchase more bits and gems. otherwise you'll be doing a lot of waiting around.  but overall very fun!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Every single book in this series is better than the previous one! I especially liked the plot twists in A Dance With Dragons!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I opened the game and was reading the introduction, hitting the &#34;CONTINUE&#34; button and the game stopped, sending me back to the home page on my Kindle.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|this movie was almost as good as the first one. I bought it before I watched it and I do not regret it
B0073LWEXK|5.0|i love this game! so fun to figure out everything plus if it gets too hard they hav unlimited hints. it takes you step by step if you get stuck. plz download!
0802473156|5.0|This is a great book for couples whether engaged or married. It really helps each person understand how the other person views and perceives \\"love\\" through their love language. I think it would be a fantastic book for marriage counseling.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|This album will not disappoint - another gritty, fanastic album by a talented group of musicians.  You still feel the soul in each song.  Awesome!
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you enjoyed the broadway musical \\"Wicked\\" you know you are in for a treat with this soundtrack! Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel have spectacular vocals that will bring the play back to life as you listen! \\"Defying Gravity\\", \\"I'm not that Girl\\", \\"Loathing\\", and \\"Dancing Through Life\\" are just some of my favorite tracks! Definitely glad I purchased this album!
B0058UXHHK|3.0|Enjoyed the story and it kept my interest, but I didn't think the characters showed enough emotion considering what they were having to deal with.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|What an irritating/intriguing game that sets up a love/hate relationship...got some things solved rather quickly...other clues languishing heaven knows where in the labyrinth of this game.  The graphics are beautiful and the solutions easy to come by and amazingly difficult to discover all in the same game.  These folks know how to do it right.  Looks great on my Kindle Fire and fun to do...only four stars instead of five 'cause sometimes it's just TOO mysterious...at least for me.
B0084U0IEG|4.0|I enjoyed this book.....found myself wishing for more depth .... kept feeling like it was a man's vision of the female experience though.
B008YU0AOE|4.0|this product is great for solving math problems teat slightly confusing and would be better if it had a scientific function for geometry
B005PK57NU|4.0|A great series that has it all - it's hard to just watch one - you are left waiting for the next show and then the next season.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Apart from Nip/Tuck I haven't watched a TV series in almost 20 years.  Having said that I can glady say I'm most appreciative for the friend who turned me on to The Walking Dead.  Its gritty for sure but the human connections are what make it appealing.  I even convinced my non-zombie loving girlfriend to watch with me and now she's hooked too!  Granted she hides her face in my shoulder when the blood starts flying.  :)
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this book!  It is just like 50 shades and I can't put it down.  I almost read it in one day and I can't wait to read the next one.
B002U6CJO2|5.0|Visually breathtaking, sexy, and it also makes you think about the consequences of hi-tech and the direct interfacing of electronics/the internet with the human mind/brain/body.  Raises some interesting questions about the nature of the soul, and of what makes us human, as opposed to sophisticated robots.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game. its the best game ive had for my kindle fire and you can't beat that it id free.
B0076DEJMO|5.0|I've read all of Abercrombie's fantasy novel and this one is more of the same and  I loved every bit of it. While the story is fairly predictable, the characters and colorful story telling more than make up for it. The book is basically the old west meets fantasy and it makes for interesting twists. The only other book that I've read that tried something similar is Sanderson's Alloy of Law. Both Abercrombie and Sanderson have realized that traipsing through magical forests in search of some ancient talisman to save the world is boring and that keeping technology at a stand still on their fantasy worlds isn't believable anymore.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Very nice game, love it, it is very good and anyone can play it, the kids love it, and I do too.
B007C3TVNA|3.0|I give this three stars for 'it's okay' because I've read the book, so I could slosh through the movie, although there were times I just wanted to shut it off and one of those times was about five minutes into the movie!<br /><br />Do NOT expect to understand this 'film' unless you've read the book, know what each character is 'thinking'. Even then, I had a hard time keeping myself from turning it off. This is a low budget art film conceived by a person from Scotland trying to capture the American lifestyle.<br /><br />MUSIC: From the opening 'credits', the music is seriously abrasive. I had to hit the mute each time it played because my dog's ears would actually cringe--at one point, she tried crawling under the couch! There was little dialogue so muting was a blessing.<br /><br />I wish someday an American film company would try to do something with this book as it is a good book that captures what it feels like when a child SOMEHOW does not want to bond with anyone, family or the outside world.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great game, everyone in the family enjoys it, and want to play it, so get ready to figth for your kindle fire, also to enjoy a great and fun game, we enjoy it a lot.
B004WR125O|1.0|I haven't been able to get this to work on my new Onkyo receiver.  I've spoken with Onkyo and recently bought a USB extension cord to try for better reception with no luck.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|All the family enjoys playing this game, very instructive by showing how to play the piano. We love it so much.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Diana Krall is one of the greatest singers ever! Her renditions of the great jazz songs as well as her interpretations of the more modern music are superb!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My girl spend hours playing this game, she loves it, and is very interesting, and fun to play it. Thanks.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Watched it for the first time this weekend & I loved it! Such a great movie. I'm so glad we bought this classic Christmas movie, love that it comes with the black & white and color disks. This is a must have. Fast shipping!
0547884591|4.0|I swore off cooking years ago, before I ever even started, really. Just had absolutely no interest in it. Tim Ferriss is probably the only dude on the planet that could change that.  After cooking my fourth dish in the last two weeks (four more than I've cooked in the last two years), I would say the book is \\"working\\".  The lessons so far are simple, enjoyable, and tasty.  The extended descriptions appear to contradict the short-hand in some lessons, but it's not such a big deal. As usual, chock full of lots of other great but not necessarily cooking-related goodies. Highly recommended.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Let's you know that the view from the golden years is clear, and amusing.  There is so much to think about in this book.  This is a great book club selection - especially for those 'of a certain age'.
1451696191|4.0|I enjoyed this book; it is a quick-read (I read it in two days) and a look at the life of a lovely, awkward, depression-prone teenager, starting his first year of high school. The book takes the form of numerous letters from the main character to an unnamed \\"Friend\\", so it reads like a diary, or sorts. Through the diary, we follow the main character through various coming-of-age events: having a crush on a girls, first kiss, experimentation with alcohol and drugs, masturbation, dealing with loneliness, and the death of a friend. The main character comes across as sensitive, perplexed, and naive, in other words, exactly the way many of us were in those crazy, teen years. I felt like I could identify with the main character, in some ways, particularly his feelings of isolation and utter confusion about the social scene around him.<br /><br />A quick, enjoyable read. Good for teens or adults.
0393317552|5.0|One of the most fascinating books I have ever read.  Hard to put down. I don't recommend starting it during finals....
B009DP9D6A|4.0|The beats and rythyms in this album are easy to listen to and great pump up jams!  Glad I got it!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Buy it! This book is super entertaining and hard to put down. ! thoroughly enjoyed it, despite the author's constant need to build up her self-esteem somehow by the need for sex with strangers. If you can get past the sex, it is a great read! Highly recommend!
B008QE9XD2|3.0|If you like his other 'weird' movies, you'll probably like this. It had it's moments. Don't now if I'll watch it again though....
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Loved this movie. Very interesting. Good love story. Great scenery. Really enjoyed every moment of it. Now I want to read the book!
B009NCM248|1.0|WTF happened to Corey!? His tired a** needs to quit putting out this corporate drivel. It is false advertising to have a creative and imaginative album cover when the contents of the CD are the musical equivalent to unflavored lukewarm oatmeal.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought this was just another silly romance.  What I got, was a story that stole my heart.  I hate the reviews that give the story away so I won't bore you with a narrative.  I just felt like a fly on the wall watching these two bungle through a drunken Vegas wedding and discover what they needed to make a marriage work.  I love a book that takes me through ALL the emotions and forms a bond with me and this book did all of that and more.  To say that I will be looking for more stories from this author is an understatement.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I haven't finished this book  yet but like the story line and characters  now that i am well into it.
B001E8WNNO|5.0|It's a very good movie I wish they would have wrote a sequel to it , it's not too late for one.
1451650728|5.0|This may contain spoilers.<br />David Mack is probably the best of the Star Trek stable of writers.  His new book The Persistence Of Memory is awesome!  He covers the missing years of Dr. Noonien Soong's life and adds an interesting twist or two to his tale.<br />Mack does an excellent job of showing how Soong matures over time and as a result of his experiences.  The ending is very touching and strikes chords in most reader's lives--mine, at least.  This writing is very moving.<br />Mack remains true to the characters of the Star Trek heroes we all have known and grown to love and admire.  Yet, he mansges to carry the narrative forward, as people do change over the years.<br />At the end, Mack thanks the readers, which I thought was very gracious, and he credits another writer with the inspiration for this trilogy, of which this one is the first.<br />Although I am anxious to read Mack's second book, Silent Weapons, I am going to start reading the book he suggested--Jeffrey Lang's Immortal Coil (2002)--to learn more about the background of this story.<br />I highly recommend The Persistence Of Memory and the rest of Mack's highly anticipated trilogy.<br />I think the interested reader should read Lang's book first, since so many of the references to Vaslovik and androids come from his book.  It would, I think, help the reader understand a few things more clearly.
0811879631|5.0|This was gift for my daughter who loved it. Beautiful color and quality, with great detail about this amazing company.
B0014NZNAO|3.0|The storyline is bizzare.  Acting is good and filming is good.  I would recommend it to a die hard western fan.  Not a family oriented film.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I've followed PTX since early on in \\"The Sing Off,\\" so buying their EP and then this album were givens for me. I am happy with the results.<br /><br />To be honest, \\"This Christmas\\" is the most like a Boyz II Men throwback, and it's not my favorite.BUT - \\"Carol of the Bells,\\" \\"O Come O Come Emanuel,\\" and \\"Angels We Have Heard On High\\" are DOPE, y'all. Dope. COTB highlight's Mitch's mighty tenor; OCOCE lets Avi showcase more than just his super bass; AWHHONH gives Kirstie a verse that is solidly in her range and she just kills it.  These will be annual favorites indefinitely.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Let's just say I  did not expect that.  I thought that she would end up an old maid, too scared too love.
B0089XH38M|5.0|I am glad I found something like this for my tablet so it will take care of the viruses which might attach itself when I am view a website.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this is a fun app that anyone can use. its great for the kindle fire hd ! and its free you cant beat that
1400049628|5.0|This book was very entertaining. Seemed like the director of The Walking Dead wrote it,  and it was very similar
B003V1WXKU|5.0|His mind was always at work solving problems but he didn't take himself seriously and he knew how to have fun.<br />He was a simple, humble and practical genius.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|You'll love this. I'm going to keep it at that. If you're a sci-fi fan, read all three. They're amazing.
B000M39HB8|5.0|This movie has all the things that make the holidays special. And I love the comedy, singing and dancing. It is a great Love story I have watched over and over throughout the years.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this and look forward to reading more books by Neil Gaiman. Prior to this, I only read Good Omens but that was primarily because I am a Terry Pratchett fan. I am glad I read it.
B0098VXE50|4.0|I really liked this Snow White. The story was wonderful until the end. I wasn't sure if I would have ended the story that way, but I understand they might have been thinking of making another one. Studios are always thinking how to start a series. The idea of her not just laying down and accepting getting killed was great. The acting was wonderful.
B009GX6600|5.0|Its an awesome series. I own every season and have watched them repeatedly. Gibbs is just mind boggling and awesome
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Winter of the World: Book Two of the Century Trilogy<br />If you liked book one you will love book two.
B008I34Z8E|5.0|I have been a Zappa fan from almost the begining I got turned on to Freak Out in high school a little after it's release so I heard his music as it was released and this one just blew my mind from the first hearing. Afyer hearing it thousand of times over the years it has lost any of it's charm. Each song just smoothly moving into the next building to the wonderful sounds of the title tune. There is so much to love about this album that beatiful guiar solo on It Just Might Be and then what has to be my favorite Zappa song Waka/Jawaka what brillance each note is so wonderfully placed where it needs to be. Don Preston's solo is tremandous leading Frank's solo the song just keeps on building. Those horns hands down one of the greatest songs ever that incredible ending with those chimes it just floors my heart everytime I hear it. I had the wonderful thrill of seeing Frank back around this time it was I guess the first time he featured the music of this album and Grand Wazoo it was in Fayetteville NC and still is one of the greatest shows I've ever seen and heard the band was the one featured on Overnight Sensation most of the show was instrumentals I can only remember Montana being the only vocal song that night. It is so great that Frank's music is staying out there Ed Palermo has an incredible big band that plays Frank's music saw them a few years ago at the jazz fest in Syracuse you can get his albums on Amazon. I got to see The Grandmothers just a few months ago and they are great lead by Napoleon Murphy Brock and Don Preston worth seeing if they are in your area. Of course Frank's son has that wonderful Zappa plays Zappa saw them a couple of times. I got to meet Dweezil after a show at the Turning Stone and he is such a wonderful person he was on stage after the show for over a half hour just talking with people. I'm so happy to see the music of what has to be the greatest composer of American music kept alive and thank you to Amazon for making it all available and for letting talk about this wonderful music.d for letting talk about this wonderful music.
B00190OHD6|5.0|What a great movie. Funny, romantic, and just plain entertaining, not to mention Gerard Butler AND Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Oh, my. Kathy Bates is wonderful, as always, as the mother.
B0051XQI84|5.0|Great movie! I really have to have a certain amount of words? Awesome is all there is to say about it!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|I knew nothing about this film and it took my breath away. It was so well done, so perfectly acted and produced, and had my husband been watching it with me, he would have cried buckets. I would highly recommend this movie, but have the tissues handy.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book kept me spell bound until I reached the ending and I was disapointed.  I kept thinging something would foul up the story. It was too good to be true.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|I knew nothing about this movie going into it, which probably made it even better. Trust, faith, values, and an understanding of the human condition make for a feel-good evening of entertainent. After all of the bad we see so often in the media, it's refreshing to see someone fight for what they believe to be right, and to achieve success. I am beginning to believe that Sandra Bullock is a 'shape-shifter' (smile)...she can play anything, it seems, even the consummate Southern Mama.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This one is right up there with Rudolph on my movie list. Will Ferrell is charming in this touching, silly silly movie. Packed with well-known actors who make me smile, Buddy's innocence and joy remind us of good childhoods and adults who won't grow up. Curl up on the couch with hot chocolate and make this one of your annual holiday shows.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was blown away by this book.  The convoluted plot twists, the incredibly well-developed characters, and the great writing made this a book I almost couldn't put down, and hated to see the end of.
1451695195|5.0|Well written and enjoyed the book. Beautiful! Very comforting and informative books. Truly enjoyed reading and sharing his experience thru the book
0316228532|1.0|Rowling cashed in on her name to write a book with no substance whatsover.  It took more than half the book to develop the characters and the plot, and then once you figured the plot out, it was pretty predictable.  The characters?  Every one of the characters was unhappy, depressed and emotionally unstable.  There is not one redeeming, believable character in the entire book.  Take any social awareness issues that have happened in the last 30 years and put them in one book; unhappy wives, abusive husbands and fathers, rape, drugs, prostitution, pedophiles, child molestation, suicide, unsafe sex, teens suffering from angst and depression,  and you have a Casual Vacancy.  The ending left me with lots of questions because none of the characters' issues were resolved.  Is she writing a sequel?  I won't buy it.  Because quite frankly the casual vacancy about this book is exactly how it leaves you feeling, vacant.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have enjoyed each season of The Walking Dead, but season 3 is by far the best. The lulls in action are not dull and once the zombies come on the scene, as always, scary and really, really gross.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|This is an excellent TV series and done exceedingly well. A few of the ancillary characters are not played as well as I would like, but all the main characters are exceedingly well played. Costuming is amazing. A great series.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Mr. Follett writes of a terrible time in the life of our world as he tells of the lives of the people in all the countries involved. All the time keeping our interest to the very last page.  Didn't want the stories to end.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|right from the very start I was drawn into the excitement of what was to happen. Its a game I'll not put down easily!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Excellent read.  Gripping & suspenseful storyline.  I did think that it ended kind of abruptly and a little too tidy but otherwise very good book!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Anyone who has watching this movies know. Just a great funny movie. I've watched this movie every year for Christmas since I was born. It's my dads tradition to and I'm hooked. Got him this blue ray to replace his OLD SCHOOL VHS. Haha
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  I was expecting more.  It has a couple funny lines.  I wanted to watch it because of Johnny Depp.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one of the best series on TV.  I wish more people would watch it.  This season just keeps getting better.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|A lot of action. Plenty of great actors in it!<br />Good 2nd movie.  Enjoyed it as much as the first one.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I pre-ordered this the minute I saw it available. Actually I ordered two. They come in a nicely packed sleeve which houses a folded Blu-Ray holder containing the 5-disc set. The book is cool...although there seems to be a lot of Nolan pics. Seemed odd.<br /><br />Either way this is a great gift set without a bunch of extra stuff you'll end up throwing away.<br /><br />BONUS - this comes with all three movies on Flixster's Ultraviolet service...another solid stocking stuffer!
B008JAGZDE|2.0|I was disappointed in this movie.  I expected more comedy.  Just not as funny not that they are older now.
B00846REIS|5.0|I think it was just as good or maybe even better than Fifty Shades, I read it all in one day it was good, once I got started couldn't stop, fixing to start the next one, going to take my time since the last one isn't out yet. A must read if you loved Fifty Shades.....
B000NGTJTY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movie.  Plenty of great actors.  It is a great story!  I highly recommend this movie
B008IJT0CE|5.0|bring more variety it is great for sleeping and rel<br />axing. I use this app for when I am stressed or just to meditate.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I enjoy this AMC series.  I look forward to each new show on Sundays!  I recommend this series.  It is violent.
B00633W614|5.0|I couldn't put the book down - it was that good!  I have already told family and friends to order it on their Kindles!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I don't have an X-Box, so I can't play that. I have a slow computer, so I can't play on the PC edition. I was extremely excited when this came out. It works great! Get this app!
B008Z9L94O|1.0|I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but my shipping sticker was put directly on the shrinkwrap and sent out of the Louisville facility, sans box.  I was shocked it came this way.  Obviously there was cosmetic damage.  In their defense, Amazon was good about getting me a replacement set out right away, it will be here tomorrow. As far as the sound goes, mine is pretty distorted throughout, most notably on the inner groove songs, but not one song sounds totally clear.  I'm hoping this had something to do with damage during the poor shipping, but since the records look immaculate I feel like it might just be horrid mastering and/or pressing.  No one else having sound issues?  It's really one of the most distorted 180g releases I've ever heard and I was surprised to see the other reviewers praise it.
B001Y8WAKA|5.0|this cd rocks u wont b disapointed fast drums /guitars and bass lines as well as biff byfords soaring vocals
B001O05X2U|5.0|There is nothing better to get your day going than MIKA! He is energetic and has a vocal range that is out of this world! His songs are so much fun and full of life!!
B008N5UX9M|2.0|disappointing / steves the greatest bass player i hope this cd dont ruin his reputation it aint got no choppy bass lines
B002OUTIOI|5.0|There is nothing better to get your day going than MIKA! He is energetic and has a vocal range that is out of this world! His songs are so much fun and full of life!!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|its awesome but it is a little glichy on my tablet it frezzez up my tablet its a little confusing at first
B005WUHAX8|5.0|It's not bulky and it was in great condition. I have dropped my phone or spilled something on it and there was no damage.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read.  I absolutely love it.  I can't put it down. I lose my self inside of it.  Absolutely amazing!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I wish it gave you more free coins. But love it! My son and I fight over who's going to play!
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Possibly the best music to ever be played in the cinema! Gerard Butler and cast are phenomenal! He makes the story!
B009SCR7RU|5.0|My 7 yr old daughter and 4 yr old son loves the movie. Storyline is very easy to follow and sweet.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love all Jack Reacher books!  This one was great.  Always well written, always a good story, ALWAYS an adventure!! Lee Child is talented.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|I bought this kindle for my wife and young kids so I definitely wanted a screen protector.  It went on extremely easy - in fact, it was so easy, I thought that I did something wrong at first.  It's pretty touch sensitive and feels great.  Under some light, there is a rainbow like distortion that goes away completely in other light.  Also, there are small dots that you can see from the screen protector which aren't too annoying.  No bubbles, however.  My wife liked it so I kept it.
B0053O89KG|4.0|Enjoyable  show.  Season 4 is well done and has lots of story lines coming together.  Started watching show upon recommendation of children then got hooked.  Looking forward to season 5 as it will be interesting to see how writers handle  storylines
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Such a fine little film.  I like anything Judi Dench does, and of course Maggie Smith is a gem. It made me want to move into the Marigold Hotel.
B003L77FYS|4.0|Charming series-characters play off each other well and easy to watch.  Enjoyable weave of story-lines and .Castle character doesn't take himself too seriously
B000W93CHC|3.0|I've only just begun this book, but so far it's reasonably interesting.  As with \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", there are some anachronisms in the text, with characters using inappropriate modern terminology, which is surprising in a writer of Follett's standard.  His editor or researcher should have caught them.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|Good show with well balanced cast.  Started watching upon recommendation of my children and enjoyed it thoroughly.  Will watch subsequent seasons
B000031EGV|1.0|I brought this movie cause my son loves it but they send me a dvd with scratches all on the back of it and a dvd case that looked like someone use it as a plate. Horrible!! And the dvd doesn't play because of the scratches what a waist of money i want to know how to return it and get my money back cause i wore when i brought it the thing said new..
B0098VYKSA|4.0|Lots of action, movie was interesting, plot line was OK . I would recommend watching this movie but it isn't Snow White & the 7 dwarfs. I wouldn't let children watch this flick.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|We've loved this movie for years. Great for Halloween. Or Christmas. Or anytime. Time Burton + Danny Elfman = Usually Awesome.
B009HELT3C|4.0|The second one was prety bad but this one is almost as good as the first. The characters were excellent but the jokes were not qhite as funny aas the first. Maybe it waas because it is no longer such a unique idea. I would still recommend it aas a weekend rental.
B000ICXQHE|3.0|Average. It was good, but was hoping for more from Spike Lee and Denzel. Plot was good, but it sort of dragged at times.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|Over a year before \\"The Matrix\\" became part of the way we watch movies, \\"Dark City\\" was telling its own story of the world pulled over the eyes of unsuspecting citizens.  While \\"The Matrix\\" told its story in the world we know today, \\"Dark City\\" chose a film noir setting of the 1940's and stays true to it, with every single frame almost resembling a Hopper painting.  An example of excelent castings, art direction, thoughtful cinematography, and special effects, the film never ceases dazzling the eye and intriguing the mind.  It was a film far ahead of its time and looks like a film that could have been made with today's digital efects technology, and remains one of Roger Ebert's favorite films of all time.  Well worth watching if you're a fan of the Wachowskis, Christopher Nolan, sci-fi, \\"Metropolis\\" or \\"The Crow\\" the director's prior film.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love this show, and this season is the best so far (as of mid-season break of S3). Jaw dropping moments.
B009NX88JU|5.0|I love this film.  I watch it every few years.  It really captures 70s rock culture -- a time when I was growing up and getting into music.
B007SSDS24|2.0|This was a lame-ass movie that I mostly watched for the kids. Once through was bearable, but more than enough.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|It's been eight years since Batman vanished into the night. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, he sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was for a greater good. For a time, it worked.  Criminal activity in Gotham City was stopped by the Dent Act. Everything changes with the arrival of a cat burglar with a mysterious agenda.  Then, the emergence of Bane comes. Bane, a masked terrorist who has ruthless plans for Gotham City. It is then, and only then, that Bruce comes out of retirement as The Batman.<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't know how I'd come out of this movie...loving it or hating it. After The Dark Knight, there were alot of high expectations set on this film. However, after watching the movie, I'll admit..this is a satisfying conclusion to Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy. Does it outdo the previous movie? No..but, taken on its' own merits, The Dark Knight Rises is an outstanding Batman film. There's lots of relentless action, a deep(scratch that)...an extremely deep storyline and plenty of eye candy. Tom Hardy doesn't make Bane quite as memorable a villain as Heath Ledger did as The Joker but he's quite an imposing force in the movie. To be honest, I never really cared for Tom Hardy as an actor but, after seeing him play Bane, I'm more confident in his acting chops and will start picking up his movies more. Christian Bale does an outstanding job as Bruce Wayne & Batman, like always. Anne Hathaway does a wonderful job as Selina Kyle/Catwoman and she provides some much needed comic relief in a movie that'd be exhausting emotionally otherwise. Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Michael Caine all did great jobs as their respective characters.<br /><br />Out of all the superhero movies that were out this year, I'd have to give this one the absolute top billing as the one I liked most. Even though The Avengers got the most credit and The Amazing Spider Man was the most fun, The Dark Knight Rise was the most compelling one out of them all. Highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises!t of them all. Highly recommend The Dark Knight Rises!
B0025YKDJC|4.0|Good movie. Sort of dragged part way through, but plenty of laugh out loud moments. Watched it with two girls, 11 and 13 and there were a couple of moments when I cringed, but it wasn't exactly wildly inappropriate.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft it is the best game I suggest u give it a try u will love it too the best things I have ever build are a rolar coaster or 8 story mansion maybe u can make something better
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great selection of sounds. You can mix and match and customize multiple sounds and even how loud each sound is.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I was not expecting so many extras (more than 7 hours worth!)  This prequel to the Alien series does a good job of answering the question of the Aliens' origin.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I love this show. I think S2 may still be my favorite so far, and I hate/love/hate how they're not afraid to kill off main characters!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Why else would Disney license it if was not good?  It is a visual feast, filled with characters probably familiar to a Japanese audience.  But that makes it all that much more exotic to a western audience.  It is rated PG so it might be a little scary to very young children.  My only regret is there is no Blu-ray version available yet.
B000I9VZJ8|2.0|I don't understand why this movie got such great reviews. It certainly wasn't an intelligent comedy, if comedy is what it was intended to be. It was simply painful to watch; almost as if a bunch of high school students made it themselves. Ugh.
B00457WZEI|5.0|i was really surprised how much i enjoyed this book, I couldn't put it down after starting it. great book! thanks
B0034G4P80|5.0|just a all around great movie from action to love to some very funny spots you will not be sorry to own this movie
B009CPES4I|4.0|Movie hit a sweet spot for my wife and I - as we move into mid 50s. We are also a fan of Judi Densch and she and others deliver an entertaining caricature of what life might be like if outsourcing pensioners to third world countries is an option ever considered.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|this movie peeked my interest  different but great can not wait for number 3 you can't go wrong buying this
B004K4IZ54|5.0|I purchased this for my husband and four sons to watch.  The loved the movie, and the graphics were excellent in 3D.  It was definitely worthy of purchasing.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I managed to read this one in a day. Such an honest portrayal of teen life that my heart aches in a nostalgic sort of way when reading it; it reminds me of the \\"glory days\\". 4 out of 5.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was thoroughly engrossed in every word. Much better than the movie. Far more detail that should have been in the movie. I strongly recommend.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book is not for writers (or hopeful writers) of horror fiction only. King has shared his expertise and his experience, which is what any good teacher does. King has said that there is a kind of telepathy that happens between Writer and Reader. I agree and Mr. King accomplishes this powerfully in &#34;On Writing&#34;. If  his &#34;Read a lot, write a lot&#34; is the commandment (it is), this should definitely be at the top of the required reading list.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|This was a delicious novel! A unique take on the oldest of all battles between good and evil, and some good recipes to boot!
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Driving beats, fantastic rhythmic changes and a beautiful range in vocals.<br />I'm going to have to invest in the other cd's for this group!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|Started this series looking for a light,,entertaining read, never expecting to be so enthralled. Deeper story than expected as you follow the characters through their quest to live their life, not simply exist to be ruled by &#34;The Society&#34;~(who, in essence, is a nanny-state goverment that picks your &#34;match&#34;, chooses your career & runs your life) Everything is for the greater good of it's people, or so &#34;The Society&#34; says. No posessions, only Society approved art, no singing, no dancing.Every one must be equal, so all have next to nothing lest, &#34;Society&#34; foribid, somebody has something more than the next person. Sorry to wonder how relevant this story will become in my lifetime.......
B0063IH60K|1.0|If popups annoy you as much as they do me, avoid this download !<br />There is no obvious exit from the popup either.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Kudos to production company on final product...making more out of a simple story line - drugs, bad guys (and girl), and what people will do for love..  Very good cast and crew that brought you into a different world...setting, imagery and emotions were all well crafted.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Nice look and feel to it and pretty straight forward to use. Thumbs up for this one . . .
0307949508|5.0|I READ ALL THESE BOOKS AND FOUND THEM VERY INTERESTING AND PASSED THEM ON TO FRIENDS WHO LOVED THEM.  TO SAD THAT THE AUTHER DIED.
B008PNBU30|2.0|Wow, and I mean that in a bad way.  They have lost their edge.  They are now working on becoming a pop rock band.  Listen to the first 3 songs because they're the only ones worth hearing, and skip the rest.<br />Major disappointment.
1451629184|5.0|I LIKED THIS BOOK BUT NOW HAVE FORGOTTEN WHAT IT was all about .  ONCE I READ THEM I GIVE THEM AWAY SINCE I USUALLY BUY PAPER BACKS.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a very long time.  I have read and reread it several times and tell everyone they too must read it.  The phrasing by the author is unique and deserves rereading!  I actually reread many paragraphs just so I could enjoy the wording again!  The characters are great!  They become so real that you actually do celebrate their accomplishments and grieve their losses.  I hope if they make a movie of this; which I would love to see; they don't change the story one bit.  It deserves to be portrayed just as it is.
0439023521|5.0|I FOUND THIS VERY INTERESTING BUT DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF WHAT THE WORLD HAD COME TO BUT AM LOOKING FORWARD TO READING THE NEXT ONE.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|if you love batman you will love this movie. we did and we will continue to watch over and over
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is making  me to look at my life more freely and makes me aware how we are interconnected with our surrounding. If every body would read it, we would have a better world....and happier people in it .
B002GSXKN8|5.0|we love batman movies so this was perfect for us! a whole set all in one box. too too cool!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. Lost some of the regulars and It's getting a little slow. but I still love the show.
B000N680VW|5.0|if you love batman then you will love this movie! we did for sure. it was awesome and we will keep watching it over and over!
B008EQIEWS|4.0|Pretty good movie. Wrath of the Titans is a really good movie. Better than I expected it to be. Was pleased.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|there is no way they could match the magic of the first film, but they tried. it comes down to this movie has a better plot than 2.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|It's an ok movie. Not in the class of the previous movies. Seems like they got a little bored and just rushed it together.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a great book.  John Grisham has continued his habit of comming up with books that are refreshing and fast moving.  I never get tired of reading his books
B004Z2TUGE|4.0|I thought this movie was a pretty good movie. Good alien characters and left off leaving us with the expectations of a sequel.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Enjoyed the evolution of the story sprinkled w &#34;fact&#34; re: jail, law.  Hurt by disclaimer at the end in which author states there was no research.  I felt he couldn't be bothered. So I don't know if I learned anything in reality.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|It's an ok movie. Not in the class of the first expendables. Heroes coming out of nowhere to save the day. Ok
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Fantastic fantasy book. Sanderson's penchant for felling gods and elevating humans to deity seems to be playing out, but if that's his thing, I guess that's fine, because it also showcases his penchant for gravity-defying combat. Deep and interesting characters make me care, although I admit it took me a while to warm up to some of them. My only concern is that Sanderson has created a lifetime of work for himself, and its essentially going to take the rest of my life (assuming Sanderson and I both live for a few more decades) to hear the story. I wish Sanderson had been born about 50 years earlier so I could just read the Archive now.
1576875776|1.0|I certainly wish I had the good sense to read the other reviews of this book before I placed my Amazon order.  I, like a great many people, looked with enthusiasm and anticipation at the publication of these images, after viewing some of them online.  Important photographs by a gifted, if unknown, artist, rendered poorly in a less than professional manner.  Muddy, brown images with many pages missing.  Hugely disappointed, and my copy will be returned to Amazon.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Action packed, and with great detail, to keep one awake all night for your 'go to sleep' reading time before lights out.
B006VREQWY|1.0|I like this show, but I feel like everytime I order another episode on \\"instant view\\" I have to cross my fingers, hold my breath and hope like heck it works.  2 out of 5 episodes I've gotten an error message.  I'm starting to think that Amazon doesn't run a very good service, I wish another, more reliable service had the selection that Amazon does because I would just order from them.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Sometimes, story line went on and on and finally got to the point.  The plot was interesting, toward the end due to the great twists and turns.  I believe &#34;third person&#34; narration is better for novels.
B0096PS4Y4|5.0|I have been looking for an Elektra gold label copy of this record for years. Unfortunately, every one I have come across \\"used\\" looks like someone had eaten a steak dinner on it and then they want a small fortune for one to boot.<br /><br />This is most likely the closest I will ever get to owning one. I already own a Elektra butterfly label pressing from the late seventies and I like it.<br /><br />The cover art is a very clean replica of the original and I cannot tell any difference. The pressing arrived in perfect condition and was \\"flat\\".<br /><br />As far as the sound goes(the most important part), the record was very quiet. The songs seem to have a different mix than I am use to so I have to listen a little more to get use to it.<br /><br /> It does sound different than either my original butterfly or the CD digital mix. I am curious to hear how other like it. I would give it a five, but I am not sure yet. It definitely deserves a four star rating, possibly a five if I change my mind. I don't know how it compares to the Sundazed version as I never got to hear one.<br /><br />No complaints from me about buying this version.I hope others like it as well.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I have listened to this album several more times since I first ordered it. I am really loving this record now. I have bumped my rating up one more star to a 5. I recently switched to a different EQ setting and compared against my butterfly version. It sounded pretty darn good.<br /><br /> I think it adds slightly more detailed without losing its ambiance. The vocals seem to be a bit more in the for-ground and I can also hear a further detailed clarity in some of the instruments.<br /><br />Latest Update:<br /><br />I have finally obtained an original \\"Gold\\" label Elektra. I was somewhat disappointed with the sound. Although there was some slight groove ware, it was not enough to get in the way EQ and I thought the original was somewhat muddy sounding. The new pressing is way better sounding in my opinion. There may possible be some better sounding gold label originals out there somewhere, but not the one I have.sounding in my opinion. There may possible be some better sounding gold label originals out there somewhere, but not the one I have.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Happy with adobe. gets job done that is needed for required jobs. I would recommend this to everyone that uses it.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Just how I remember Santana.... and what you would expect of him. Enjoying listening to this album! Worth getting it!
0670451495|5.0|This is one of those classic books that every child should own. We read it in anticipation of our trip to Boston this past summer. My daughter was super excited and couldn't wait to go on the swan boat to look for Mr and Mrs. Mallard.
B004UHF51S|5.0|I loved this album.... reminded me of another Michael Franks classic - Sleeping Gypsy!!!! I am still enjoying listening to this!
B008MEM24S|4.0|This was a fun, easy and addictive game!  Probably better suited for a younger player-but it suited me as well.  Good graphics and multiple levels!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This film is so enjoyable on so many levels. First, George Clooney . . . is doing comedy? Oh Yeah . . . and he is SPENDID as always, which explains why this is one of my wife's favorite films. But, the wonderful supporting cast of characters: Holly Hunter, John Goodman, and oh so many others, well, this is just one treat after another. Set in the Deep South during the 1930s, when gangsters ran amuck, and the &#34;times-were-a changing&#34; . . . But, this movie is not just funny, and a delight to see . . . the MUSIC is superb! I know it won many awards, and yes, I bought the CD and play it constantly. But, how many movies do you see where you watch it so many times again, and again . . . that you can recite the lines before the actors even say them? Answer: THIS ONE.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This is a great puzzle game with nice graphics.  There are multiple challenging levels with varying difficultly plus you are awarded different medals for each solution-so you can replay each level to obtain desired medal.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|You get sucked into the virtual reality of the subject.  Fascinating, interesting & adds another dimension to anyone who is an F Scott Fitzgerald-lover ....
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love the Pinterest website to collect and store craft ideas and recipes in an attractive way-this makes it a nice way to take with me on my Kindle Fire!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Far fetched & doesn't live up to the hype I've seen in so many publications (online & published).  But an entertaining read.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is great case!  Very sleek and durable.  It fits very tight onto the kindle for a very secure fit.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|I purchased this movie so I could have a Blu Ray copy and a digital Copy version as well.  The digital copy is a version that CANNOT be downloaded and is incompatible with Apple products!  I might as well of just bought the regular Blu Ray version for less.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is every bit as addictive and fun as you've heard!  My boyfriend and I are constantly fighting over who gets to play!
B007EECSFA|4.0|I enjoyed this book and found myself wanting to get back to it whenever I could. About halfway through I was thinking, &#34;Is this all there is to this story?&#34; One of the main characters seemed so shallow and ridiculous. However, there's a payoff! Well worth reading.
B004LROUW2|1.0|I read this book for a book club.  It is extremely long and very repetitive .  I have since heard that it is based on a very short short-story and I completely believe it.  An extremely edited down version would be much better.
B004DMIIOG|5.0|I found out about this movie because I am a big fan of the Miyazaki films, and the other movie by the same director, Mamoru Hosoda, was listed in my recommended movies from Amazon (because I liked the Miyazaki films).  When the other film, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, went out of print, I decided to purchase this one just in case it also went out of print.  I ended up snatching it up for $12.50 on black Friday 2012 without really knowing anything about the movie, and wow, am I glad that I did.<br /><br />I watched the movie last night with my wife, and was totally shocked at what a great movie this is.  I skimmed the description and some of the other reviews, and I was under the impression that this was a movie about people using magical animals to do battle.  I was completely wrong, and to my surprise, it was a zany story about two kids who are thrown in to a situation where they need to save the world from a malicious AI that takes over the Internet.<br /><br />The story starts out so completely normal, similar to Miyazaki's films, then the protagonists are thrown into a completely surreal adventure.<br /><br />Audio<br /><br />The audio is excellent.  It really makes good use of the 5.1 surround sound, I really enjoyed the entire experience.<br /><br />Video quality<br /><br />The video quality is very good.  Definitely on-par for an HD animation.<br /><br />Art<br /><br />The art in this film is just fantastic.  There are so many really cool scenes where there are huge over-the-top action with things crashing, fights, explosions.  The landscape and the detail are all very good.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />This is just an all around great story.  You really get to love the characters and you really are pulled into the moment.  I really got attached to all of the characters; I really can't say enough how much I loved this movie.  I highly recommend you pick this up, it really is a great movie.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I thought this was a fun game along the lines of old-school Mario Bros. games.  I think it is definitely a good game if you are missing your old Nintendo!
B0010358CG|4.0|I originally watched this movie on Netflix streaming, and found it for $11.49 for black Friday 2012, and could not pass it up for that price.<br /><br />The movie overall is a good movie; it's nothing earth-shattering or a must-have, but it's a good watch and has really great CG and sound.<br /><br />The visuals and surround sound are both excellent; the description that's on the Amazon description is very accurate.  The story is a futuristic cop story with really cool mech suits and cloned humans with bionic attachments.  I really enjoyed the combat and the whole theme of the world.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good movie, not a great movie, but it's definitely worth a watch; definitely worth $11.50.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This is a fun version of the beloved Angry Birds game!  If you aren't convinced to get the other version-try this for free and see what the hype is all about!
0316067598|5.0|I bought the kindle version, read it and went ahead a ordered a hard copy. The personal story<br />of the Seal team does honor to all in the military. If you are looking on giving a gift, this book is it.
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|It takes the arrival of the undead to help mankind realize that their vicious groupthink behavior is despicable. Norman is a child who is gifted in that he can see and communicate with the dead. One day a huge task falls into his lap when he discover the return of his town's curse is a package deal that includes a witch as well. A fun watch and a great moral lesson to boot.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Riveting plot set in our times of combating Al Queda terrorism. Why was Mitch Rapp not at Benghazi? Great read!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I absolutely love this show and am now catching up by watching season one! I intend on watching season 2 as well. Great writing and a great cast make for a memorable viewing experience.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|#1 excellent, #2-#4 were depressing reads and almost made me give up reading, #5 was awesome! So glad I had the Omnibus edition I might not have kept going and would have missed out.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer eat your heart out, literally. Tim Burton's warped view of the world play in perfectly to this stop animation classic. A true primer for the holiday season.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I love the movie. I got hooked on the series (Firefly) before I saw the movie. When I saw it on Amazon on Firefly's 10th anniversary. I knew I had to have it. I recommend this movie to all SciFi fans.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Many people don't like this movie. They don't like what director Abrams did in switching up some things in the Star Trek universe, but I thought it was a refreshing, welcome and needed change for a franchise that was sort of dying. The DVD also comes with a digital download version. Star Trek lives!
B0099114WO|4.0|This movie is for everyone in a serious relationship/marriage. It doesn't matter how young/old you are. The message is the same, in order to have the best relationship possible you and the one you love need to communicate and put work into all aspects of your life together. I laughed and cringed and felt sad for the characters throughout the movie. I will remember this movie and how I related to it. This movie is one I will watch again. The next time it will be with my significant other. The fact that I would be wiling to watch it again is the best recommendation I can give it. Watch it and decide for yourself.
B009HEN7LY|4.0|Another good movie for the MIB series. Graphics are great in HD and the whole family loved it. Not as good as the original, but what movies are now days.
B0122YCUJU|4.0|This latest BD version is noticeably improved in picture and sound over the previous BD release disaster. Picture is brighter and colors more saturated. Certainly pops much more than it used to look. If you have the old or original BD version, toss it and buy this one.
B005LAIHQS|1.0|What can you say about the movie, but that it is awesome. Loved it more than the previous ones and would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />My one star is for this DVD set as I found out that the UltraViolet Digital Copy can not be downloaded to iTunes. UltraViolet can only be played streaming. My primary use for the digital download is for loading the family iPads for road trips or flights when we don't have a wi-fi connection. Sony and some of the other studios used to offer real digital downloads but now want to make their 'digital copy' proprietary which is alienating iTunes users. The Blu-Ray disc for me is of secondary value as we may watch it once and then put it on the shelf. I did email Sony customer service and they politely confirmed that they will not provide a real download of this movie for iTunes unless I purchase it separately at full price.<br /><br />So, I'm returning this set of DVDs and downloading the movie from iTunes. That way I can play it through the AppleTV or load it on the iPad.<br /><br />So CAVEAT EMPTOR and read the fine print before you buy a DVD with a 'digital copy'.<br /><br />Note to Amazon:  Can you please put a large print disclaimer on your item description? -  NOT COMPATIBLE WITH ITUNES -
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Great movie that you wouldn't think would be this funny, but really is. You will laugh your ass off for the entire thing. I didn't believe it would be as funny as it was, but do yourself a favor and watch it.
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|Very much enjoyed the movie for it's visual quality.  Also a fan of Amanda Seyfried, but I found the story line to be weak.
B007M2S5WO|5.0|The Towering Inferno: Is a movie feel that not only keeps one interested for over 2 hours, but also shows well the horrors and dangers firemen go through.  Good service from selling.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I enjoy this game but the glitches are insane.  This last update has been horrid!  Attempting to click on anything beyond about first 4-5, especially in crops &amp; decorations, causes the game to crash.  Clicking on one particular character when she had a message did the same.  I finally gave up &amp; uninstalled with the intent to reinstall.... but now I cannot reinstall because the installer thinks it is still on my device..... PLEASE FIX THIS GAME!!!!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I have zero complaints. It is a great ap and works as advertised. I really like that it works even if its not running.
0547884591|5.0|For a man who adheres strongly to the Pareto Principle, it's ironic you there is no definitive 20% of this book that will give you 80% of its actual content. This is a good thing. I look forward to thumbing the pages well, using its lessons effectively, and mastering many of the skills outlined in here on my own. Thanks!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|This app was fun for a while but alas like all of these apps it crapped out and will not function properly?
B00881VLCE|4.0|Lots of fun.  I do like that you can change the size of the puzzle pieces to make it more difficult.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|Battery HD is a great app that tells you how much battery life you used, how you used it, and how much of it is left. It is also a widget, which is good for people running alternative laucnhers like GO Launcher EX (go Google it).  The only problem I have with it is that the Standby time is really off. Other than that, great app and widget. I hear it's already on current gen Kindles, so those people like me who got their Kindle a while ago should get this app.  Get it!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Only bought these books to see what the fuss was about.  I had no idea they are allegedly Twilight Fan Fiction novels or I wouldn't have bought a single one!  Either way they are so poorly written, outlandish,  predictable and repetative they suck in thier own right.  Ladies- if you're looking for smutty Romance novels TRUST ME - there ARE better written ones!!
B002GYI96U|4.0|Funny and enjoyable. It reminds me of some friends that I do have. I was introduced to Madeleine by one friend who actually behaves like the main character in her books
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Imagine if you asked a 6th grader to rewrite Twilight - only replacing the hot male character's hang ups from being secretly a vampire - with kinky fetishes and really unhealthy desires towards domestic violence.  That would be the 50 Shades trilogy in a nutshell.  And imagine for the second book you asked the 6th grader - drawing on all her knowledge in relationships, sex and romance- to just write a paragraph about two people having sex and being rich and powerful and then told her to repeat the same paragraph over and over for the entire book - that would be book 2 in a nutshell.  I wish amazon offered us the chance to award negative stars in reviews sometimes.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|Some women enjoy using shopping as a way to rid theselves of stress.  Sofie<br />Kinsella appeals to most women shoppers.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I am not going to try to analyze this book - there are too many literary geniuses out there already doing the same.  All I will say is that the characters are so real and remain so,  months after reading,  the story is not only desperatley gripping but eye opening and life changing.  David Mitchell manages to completely alter my feelings on humanity and civilization seemingly without whispering one word in effort to change my mind.  I put this book down and then immediatley picked it back up and read it again - and it remains in my constant thoughts and dreams.  Please don't judge this book by the movie.  Great read!
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Huge Rihanna fan and there is something for everyone on Unapologetic! She always delivers, you simply can't go wrong buying a Rihanna cd.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|My expectations for this book weren't high- I honestly was only drawn to it because the cover art resembled LOST - my favorite Tv show!  But it was great, there was a fair amount of suspense, the characters were pretty well developed and I loved the mind-blowing ending!  I hope this author continues to produce similar works!! Great read!
B007H7XJD4|3.0|I enjoyed this film and it was nice to see some not so famous actors. I would have like to see more interaction with the gods.
B0016J797Q|5.0|Excelente y antes del tiempo señalado. Producto de buena calidad y a buen precio, sigan asi. Me gusto mucho. Gracias.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I thought the acting was just ok. I didn't care for the fact his wife died right in the beginning but the story line was fine. I enjoy movies from this genre.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|4.5 stars for the film TDKR, but...<br /><br />Buyer beware, I have attempted to access the \\"Digital Copy,\\" but the Ultraviolet site was initially unresponsive. UVVU.com then lost my password, is slow to load. Web interface is buggy. I am now getting \\"Service Temporarily Unavailable\\". The Flixster app hangs on my 2012 MacBook Pro computer.<br /><br />The Ultraviolet system is a fraud. It fails to deliver the service or product promised. Flixster/Ultraviolet. What a confusing mess. Now that's branding done badly.<br />Beware: Digital Copy Download means nothing. You are getting nothing. Nothing but the 2 BluRay discs and 1 DVD in this purchase.<br /><br />I have not before seen so many low-rating reviews in agreement about a product (the UV system). Unfortunately, the \\"most helpful\\" reviews were written before the actual home release and seem to be written by fanboys who could not have experienced the frustration with \\"download.\\"<br /><br />Amazon, please kill the UV \\"Digital Copy\\" claim. I won't be buying any more.<br /><br />UPDATE: After starting a support ticket, I received a form response from Flixster. It did not address my specified issue (the mac App does not work). Even though I replied to their standard suggestion, I have not received a follow-up more than one business day later. Has Flixster abandoned me?
B00456PKG4|4.0|The movie was good, better than I expected from the previews. I thought it would be more cheesy but it was a nice movie to watch.
B006C3Q6GG|3.0|I am a big fan of the Hornblower stories, so I thought I would probably like this book and series.  I found the naval action interesting, but felt like the character development was lacking.  The author doesn't really get into the personalities of the characters enough to really understand why they do the things they do.  It seemed like there was far too much period slang used as well.  Maybe I just didn't get it because I'm an ignorant Yank, though.  I'm not feeling motivated to buy any more of the series at the moment.  There are far too many great books out there to invest my time in something that is just mediocre.
B003XU02QG|5.0|I enjoyed this film very much. I love movies from this genre and time period. I would watch again and suggest it to others.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|It was OK; not great.  The cinematography was very good and the music went well with the theme of the story.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I wish every father would be like these men and step up for the kids... Its a lesson and a wonderful movie, very touching yet once again has something for everyone in it and Im sure anyone who watches this movie will not regret it and will watch it over and over as we do.
B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This helped me reorganise my thinking, count my blessings.  Contains many lessons for living; encouraging and uplifting despite the suffering.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Since puzzle / adventure games are my favorite, I'm always ready to try a new one . . . expecially if it's free.<br />I was not disappointed.  Although it may be a little weak in the adventure story line, I really enjoyed the wide varriety of puzzles.<br />I would have paid for this game.  Thanks for offering it free.  I'll have to try more Fire Maple Games!
B008673ZAQ|1.0|This story just didn't catch me.  I felt it was a downer after reading the first book.  I was expecting it to draw me in and keep my attention.  Normally if love a book I can't put it down and this one took several weeks to read instead of my normal couple of days.
B007HACDLK|5.0|excellent novel by vince flynn. mitch rapp is a little more in the forefront...little more in charge.  The Afghan conundrum is played out to a tee in this story.  Great writing.  Keep telling us what's going on around the world, Vince Flynn!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I have absolutely fallen in love with this game!  that is until it did an update now if closes immediately after I make an action selection. I even reported the problem and have yet to hear back or have it fixed. please fix this as I would love to keep playing. I would have given this 5 stars up until two weeks ago. now?  maybe 2?? and that's being generous right now.
B0098460O4|3.0|I bought the album primarily for \\"The Prayer\\" and was astonished at how poorly the song was engineered. The background singers are in the way most of the time and occasionally Jonathan sounds as if he has been forced to sing from the back of the room. A better version of \\"The Prayer\\" (from a sound quality standpoint) would be Jonathan and Charlotte's Sun Biz-sessions [...].<br /><br />All that being said, the album contains 10 wonderful songs. I only wish the background stayed in the background where it belongs not occasionally (but too frequently for my taste) intruding on J&C's beautiful voices.
B007THA4FI|4.0|This book was really hard to follow at first. It wasn't until half way through the book that i even remembered all the characters names and how they related to each other. However, if you can read it through to the end it really is every interesting how everyone's lives affect the people around them. This book is NOT for kids! It talks about drugs, sex, rape, and death. This is definitely an adult book
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good story line, but the story did seem to wander a bit.  Because of the wandering, it took a while to get into book, which has not been usual for a Grisham story.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Very addictive game. I couldn't stop playing until I finished.<br />It would have been helpful though if each area were marked<br />with it's corresponding level #.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Great read. This story keeps you right where it wants you on every page. It feels like you can predict what's going to happen and when you do...then you reel from the subtle turns and ‘harmonies.'
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is a new author to me. I really enjoyed the book and look forward to reading another one .The Last Man  was a great read.
B005ZTFPFQ|4.0|This game is exactly as it is advertised. You get one game free and pay for the rest. I love the old Atari  ames, so I bought them all. It is a great value.
B00A0R42L6|5.0|This is another &#34;hit&#34; in the ice age series.  The story line is good and the introduction of &#34;granny&#34; to the family is a nice touch.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This is another show that breaks from the norm and sets a new standard for a show that is different in so many ways.  Season 2 lives up to the standards set by Season 1.  The bad guys in this show is balanced nicely with the good guys.  Even the main character-Regina, trying to change for her step-son.  Highly recommended show.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I have read all 3 books 3 times,the best books ever,people say that its just full of sex,it is but there is also a fantastic story behind it,there is no one i know that has not read it
B0050UEVNM|5.0|Great one liners and outstanding casting...nice early work for Angelina Jolie here. If you're a fan of Love Actually, I highly recommend this movie to you.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 is awesome! This is the first persona game that I've played.  I recently got a vita and heard everyone raving about this game and since I love RPG's, I figured that I would give it a shot.  Let me just say this...seeing a game that is this polished is very rare! The level of detail in this game never ceases to amaze me!  Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:<br /><br />- Steam coming off of food when characters eat and accurate sound effects when they pop open containers, etc...<br />- About 80% of all dialogue in the game is voice.  The voice actors are amazing and you get a lot closer to the characters in the game because of that.<br />- While listening to the dialogue, if you miss something or happen to zone out, you can hit select at any time and the entire conversation history will pop up! In this history you can not only read things again but if you hit x on a certain piece of dialogue, that character will speak that part to you again! This feature is really cool and something that I have never seen in another game.  Really smart idea!<br />- The load times are amazing! They are still present...but so short that I find myself happily jamming out to the cool soundtrack as the game speedily loads to the next scene.<br />- The interface (menu's, control scheme) are perfect for the vita.  I haven't come across any touch features really...but that's okay.  The menu's are very pretty and sharp on the Vita's OLED screen.<br /><br />While the whole game is amazing, it's these little extra details that I love because a lot of developers either don't do these things, or don't take the time to do them right.  Any who, I'm not going to make this review massive or anything.  In short, I also love the story and game-play...but now I want to get back to playing the game! ha-ha I just had to tell people that I very rarely play games that have this level of polish to them (and I have been a gamer ever since I was little...so I've played a lot of games)! This game is great and I would recommend it to anyone that has a vita!!! You've got to play this game!<br /><br />5 stars, two thumbs up, etc... etc... :-)
B00004D0DT|1.0|This copy is a Region 2 (UK Only) DVD. So it won't play on a dvd player with region 1 (North America).
B0073HNLK4|5.0|I enjoyed this read. It goes slowly backwards and forwards in time which might be confusing but which ends up being a gentle roller coaster as Banville leads the reader through significant events from his - or the central protagonist's - life. These events seem to stand apart from a past, present and future. They exist somewhere - anywhere -in time and space! As one gets older, we often view events as sparks/energies standing on their own unconnected to other events. Banville effectively conveys this. No character really dominates the story although there is an attempt by Chloe to do so, which makes the ending surprising in many ways. Banville's mastery of English enriches the story.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this clock is perfect for my every day routine. it wakes me up for school and warns me when my battery might die this app is just so amazing I recommend it to anyone with a busy schedule
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I have absolutely loved Once Upon a Time from the beginning.  The depth of the characters is well-planned and they complement each other.  You can definitely tell that Disney is involved as these are strongly tied to the trademarked characters, but not as cartoonish as the ones you see at the parks.  I can't wait for more episodes!
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Though this is a movie centered around the taking of drugs which I absolutely abhor in life, how awesome to take one little pill and have all the mental clarity in the world... to unlock your truest potential. Amazing and I'm thrilled that he ended up smarter than the drugs. Makes me feel good about owning this movie.
B003Y5D776|5.0|I use it to convert my cassettes to .mp3s and it works great. Well worth the money. Just plug it in and go.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|As usual Christina does not disappoint in her vocal ability as well as in her ability to make you feel each lyric as if you wrote the words yourself. I have always been more partial to her ballads over the years as that is where her voice is truly appreciated...by myself at least. I enjoyed Your Body as well, though I was expecting a slightly different version than what surfaced on the album. Gotta love the Internet sometimes I suppose. Not a fan of remixed songs either unfortunately, so that track usually gets skipped. Have to admit also to being slightly disappointed in an &#34;explicit&#34; album having only one song that was unedited and one that had clearly been &#34;bleeped&#34; in all areas. I'm not quite sure I understand that at all even if it were her direct intention. That takes something away from the expression of the song at times for me but still very much enjoying this album!
B009SQRC9E|5.0|Funny, clever, imaginative, but heartwarming. Christmas classic in the making. We laughed throughout, but the end was so heartwarming! Recommended for all ages.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I wasn't sure about this show during season 1 but in season 2 the writing and performances have blown me away.  Regina's storyline is the most compelling to me creating a complicated character whose journey is fascinating.  Lana Parrilla and Robert Carlyle eat the screen up with their characters.  This show has the absolute best version of Snow White imaginable.  Love the retelling of stories I read and watched as a child.  I much prefer this version to those.
0061438294|4.0|The thing I like about this book is that it gave me insight into what people are reallly thinking when they are talking to you. Lots of times their mouth is saying one thing but their hands, legs, fingers, are saying something entirely different.
B008VBYN80|5.0|You have to try this game out. Its slow going at first but picks up. The best thing is you don't have to beg friends for items and you can play without a wiring connection on your kindle.
B0083DJWGO|1.0|I am a big fan of Taleb's Dynamic Hedging book as well as \\"Fooled by Randomness\\". I really enjoyed his pragmatic approach to risk management and probabilities. It still resonates with me when he explained that over information (checking the value of your 401K portfolio everyday) will make you prone to see more noise than signal (fluctuations in the short term overwhelm the long term). So I was waiting anxiously to read his new book.<br /><br />Oh boy, what an embarrassing document. The book is very short on insights and long on personal anecdotes of somebody that do not have to worry about providing the next meal for his family. Taleb has become a pedantic armchair iconoclast detached for any society not related to the U.S or ancient civilizations.<br /><br />He possesses the truth on everything and he shows how the world is against him but he is right. He criticizes everybody that it's easy to criticize: Central Banks, Investment Bankers, Governments, U.S. Healthcare, Technology, Newspapers. He loves dropping names as well as referencing old books and most of the evidence he provides are from his life experience. Moreover, the book is a continuous contradiction in which he states that controlled shocks and pains make the antifragile system stronger but he never praised when the Fed let Lehman and Bear Stearns fail, what a better way to show pain? or he says that he wants to write a book with no technology, like ancient people did. I guess he has not seen the change in quality of life of people since the printing press was invented. Or realizing that I just pay him over $20 dollars for an electronic edition that I couldn't be able to purchase if I were waiting for his handwritten version to be delivered. He hates journalism and newspaper but he owes all his fame to them. Using Nate Silver's analogy he is a Hedgehog and he is famous because \\"There are some academics who are quite content to be relatively anonymous. But there are other people who aspire to be public intellectuals, to be pretty bold and to attach non-negligible probabilities to fairly dramatic change. That's much more likely to bring your attention\\".<br /><br />Sadly, Mr. Taleb sees himself as a mix between Chuck Norris and The most interesting man in the world. \\"I don't usually lift weights, but when I do, I'll do it better than anybody else\\". When Alexander Bell invented the telephone he had 3 missed calls from Nassim Taleb's cellphone.<br /><br />It will be nice to see Mr. Taleb walking the walk. For example, since he makes so much money in the markets, I would love that he post his trades and predictions so we can learn more about how to exploit this system so easily as he does.<br /><br />The book is like one of those Mission Impossible movies in which Tom Cruise is on screen 90% of the movie showing you how awesome he is and how he can beat the evil system. If you like that kind of movies, this is your book
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Action packed. This movie had just about all the Marvel characters.  Great special effects. Great fight sequences. My family liked this movie.
B008220AVW|5.0|Katy Perry the Movie was great! my grand kids really enjoyed singing all of her songs and the movie itself.  I recommend this to everyone that loves a great family movie.
B008ALAHA4|3.0|If you have older magsafe 1 power adapters that you want to use with the newer magsafe 2 machine then this is what you need. Unfortunately, it doesn't always dock correctly between the machine and the cable causing the machine to now charge. When you connect it make sure the charge light comes on. If it doesn't jiggle the connector a bit until it does. Good luck...
8866130915|3.0|A little too small for my tastes. Will try to re-gift it. Not worth it to send it back. Oh we'll
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every Vince Flynn book ever written.  This one didn't disappoint either.  I love the twists and turns, and Vince's ability to capture and portray the tension and intrigue in the spy community.
B008MM9630|4.0|its fun except the gems it makes you save them but like you want to get as many as you want but you have to save them
B005LAII08|5.0|A fantastic movie, with a wonderful message about being yourself, and sticking up for what you believe in.  I spent the extra money to support the package that came with a true digital copy.  No Ultraviolet here, and I supported it with my hard earned dollars.
B005898DDO|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this video! I've been a fan of Bob Dylan's since the 1960's. This video was put together quite well.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I love that this movie came with an i-Tunes digital copy, thank you movie studio!  Great movie also, I loved it!
B000OCXI3K|5.0|I had seen the movie and reading the book brought back all of the wonder of that film. It is one that I will read again and again!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife called me all excited because Amazon had season 3 online.  But after we downloaded the show we found out that it is just a teaser.
B0080R3ZY8|5.0|My daughter uses this story to motivate her Kindergarten students to work hard and stay focused as the Very Busy Spider, as they complete the many learning activities in the classroom. Students are rewarded with small cute pom-pom spiders on their desk when they are caught following the Very Busy Spider's good example.!<br />What a great book!
B008EEHRAU|5.0|Love the movie, actors, humor, and powerful women... Johnny Depp is not to bad either in the role as a gypsy who is a musician...
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This is solid performer in the genre of SCi-Fi movies. Very interesting from beginning to the end with unexpected turns. I strongly advise it to Sci-Fi fans.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|THis move is very cute.  My kids, my self, and my sister loved it and watched it the next night also.  Great movie!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Fun seeing the character development and interactions. It's got lots of action but still some good comedy. I highly recommend it!
0670022411|5.0|I absolutely love this book, and am not quite finished yet, but have great difficulty putting it down!  It is written on an adult level, and is entwined with multiple twists and turns&#62; Totally Fascinating!
B000F3HS84|4.0|I have never read this book for some reason.  It was a beautifully written book and kept my interest throughout.  I thought it would be dated as so many of the old classics seem, but the beautiful pictures that are painted with words kept me reading.  I rented the PBS special of Rebecca and it followed the book nicely.
B008PNBU30|4.0|Its just another three days grace cd, nothing to good and or bad about it. Same sound same band, worth the  money
B0016OMFNY|5.0|I like rock music alot and remember when this group started. After hearing the CD I'm kind of mad at myself for not getting it before.
0307346617|5.0|21. December 2012 is coming up, so you better read up! Very interesting perspectives from all over the world after the Zombie Apocalypse is (more or less) over. I especially like the part about what happens to North Korea, which brings up tons of questions.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Appallingly written, aimed at 18 - 20's or the uninitiated and people who don't usually read books.  Utter tripe.  For people who grew up in England reading Jackie comic -  it was like an adult version of Jackie without the pictures. Couldn't finish it let alone get onto book 2 and 3.  Waste of money.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I CHOSE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE THIS GUY CAN SING! HE IS SO HUMBLE, AND I GUESS THAT IS WHAT MAKES HIM SUCH A GOOD SINGER.
B00413QB5A|4.0|Another good book by Ken Follet. I must have missed it when it first came out. Almost any book by Ken Follet if worth reading.
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|great movie lots of enjoyment i like the behind the scenes  its a blu-ray what more do u need thank you*
B0024CEY36|4.0|Another god book by Ken Follet. Hate wasting more words on a good author. Hate wubmitting these reviews, o. o
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love all of the great stuff that you can find.  It is like my online notebook.  So many different postings.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is the movie loosely based on the novel These Foolish Things, by British author, Deborah Moggach. The basic premise of the movie is that a group of older Britons travel to India to reside in a hotel near Jaipur. What they have been sold, and what they actually get, are two different things, but, between them, somehow, this group of strangers finds something worthwhile. On this, the book and the movie agree, but on many significant points, the movie differs greatly from the novel. Norman, well played by Ronald Pickup, is much less objectionable in the movie. Maggie Smith does a wonderful portrayal of Muriel Donnelly, as does Judi Dench of Evelyn Greenslade. Douglas Ainslie (Bill Nighy) is a similar character in both movie and novel, but Jean Ainslie (Penelope Wilton) is markedly different. Graham Dashwood, played by Tom Wilkinson, is an entirely new character who seems to be a composite of Adam Ainslie, Graham Turner and Dorothy Miller. Celia Imrie does a magnificent job playing Madge Hardcastle (MadgeRheinhart in the book) and Dev Patel is marvellous as Sonny Kapoor, another composite (Sonny Rahim and Minoo Cowsajee). Although the screenplay is quite different from the novel plot, it works well and there are plenty of laughs as well as some lump in the throat moments. A real pleasure to watch.
B004C00EM8|5.0|fresh fresh fresh! this movie something new in a dying genre. It may be &#34;trendy&#34; in the horror world to enjoy it but let me tell you; Theres a reason why it blows most movies out of the water.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I enjoyed the product immensely. I received it in good shape. I would like to thank the company I got it from that they did an excellent job. It wasn't damaged at all.
B0096HIEE2|2.0|By mistake I bought the download instead of the movie. It was very dark like a bootleg............is it worth watching again?
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I just purchased this movie and I can not believe they are selling this without Itunes...Ultraviolet is horrible...My entire library revolves around itunes....And ultraviolet use to send out itunes code for unsatisfied customer, but they have stopped that apparently. I already have this downloaded, and bluray isnt as important that having a itunes digital copy. So I will be returning this movie and just buy a digital copy. I just cant believe they are releases such a major movie with ultraviolet
B002SEZNCQ|4.0|This movie is somewhat of a documentary. I understand it is based on true events.  I recommend it for all religious of all faiths.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I resisted getting this for the longest time. Ridiculous, because it is now a definite go record in my collection and I wish i had it in every available media form. &#34;I Will Wait' is the intro many have to this group. If that is the hook that grabs you, you will not be disappointed in the other gems you discover,
B0093FNZT6|5.0|This book, while not skimping on the medical details, is easy to read and understand.<br />Dr Alexander is able to answer all of the medical possibilities which could account for the experience he had.<br />This book will do much to dispel the fear that many people have of what lies beyond the grave.<br />I believe Dr Alexander's experience is proof of an afterlife in another dimension.<br />His book may well alter the way people choose to live their earthly life.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who seeks an answer to the question of is there life beyond our earthly existence<br />and how can we connect to the universal source.<br /><br />Thyme
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Loved it.  Listened to it everytime I was in my car for about a month, and then I got burned out.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Super game. Super arrangements of tiles. Woulf recommend the game to everyone that likes the solo setting. Get it and enjoy.
B009LRE040|5.0|I loved both previous installments of the Nolan Batman universe.  I think the third and final film in this arch takes the best portions of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and blends them very well into a movie that focuses in on Bruce Wayne and his true purpose and legacy for Gotham and also provides the villain and threat levels we sense with Heath Ledger's Joker.  The cinematography is great.  The acting is top-nothc.  Effects looks good.  The Indian prison set is quite memorable.  I think this film basically makes this trilogy perfect and worth seeing from start to finish.
B009LK6JS2|3.0|Realistic Graphics and Flight Controls make it seem very real.  Unfortunately, it does not always work as described on Xoom Tablet;  It is tough to fly steady even after I calibrated it.  Though you follow instructions and heading marker, you often get off course and even find yourself UPSIDE DOWN.  Safe landing part is extremely hard for me though I try to approach very slow and carefully.  I like it but have issues with controls like many other reviewers.  Something may be wrong with app that causes the problems (not just our inability to get used to it).  Maybe it needs to be optimized better for all devices? Good app but had to subtract 2 Stars for poor Control issues.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter love's it. Saving and earning coins to buy ponies to save ponyville. Good graphics fun games and user friendly.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Dr. Panda is a wonderful Interactive game for small children that keeps them Engaged and Entertained very well.  They have Fun while learning about caring for patients in Cute and Methodical ways with many decisions to make on their own.<br /><br />Graphics are very Good with Colorful, Cute and Interesting Animal Patients to care for.<br />Many nice Sounds and Special Effects like X-Ray, Stomach Scope, Exam Light, etc.<br />You take Patients from Hospital Entrance to Elevator and Exam Rooms for treatment.<br />Player Plans and Executes varying tasks in different rooms (including cleanup) to help patients.<br />Challenges are Unique, Easy and Enjoyable enough to keep players interested and happy.<br />The Ailments require use of Band-Aids, Pressure Cuff, Syringe, X-Ray, Eye Drops, etc.<br />Good, well planned care will give you chances to pick Prizes (like stickers) on Achievement page.<br />App works well with No Ads or other Annoyances of any kind.<br /><br />Overall:  A very Good Child's app that has Great Replay Value.  I recommend it.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I've been hearing about the Persona series for a few years now and sad that I missed it on PS2. I was about to pick up Persona 3 Portable on the PSP but I heard Persoana 4 Golden was on it's way to my new Playstaion Vita. I waited and well worth it! I have a full time + job and 2 weeks later I'm 20 hours into it! Very character driven, you really feel for these characters and want to spend more time with them. Not only \\"dungeon crawling\\" but living your life in modern day japan \\"in the real world.\\"<br />Very fun turn based battle system with a lot of option on what attack/buff you want to do with the tons of Personas you can collect and only take a few into battle so choose wisely and even collect more on the way! You can even Fuse Personas together and create new ones and I love the fact that you see end result without finalizing you decision.<br />Lots of intrigue and mystery with through the main story as well.
