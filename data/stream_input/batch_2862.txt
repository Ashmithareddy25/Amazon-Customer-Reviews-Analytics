B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series really depicts womanly strength. I love seeing how independant, strong, caring, and giving these women are. I know it may sound silly, but watching this show makes me want to be brave. :)
B00AJER3SE|5.0|I was blown away by this movie in the theater and have loved it ever since. I think this could be hit today if it had never been seen before now. This is probably the best the show has ever looked.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best drama on television.  The story lines are complex but not confusing (true blood).  Like the characters but getting close to &#34;Game of thrones&#34; death rate of lead characters.
B008C0C1Y8|5.0|This movie is so cliched and stiff that it almost makes it its on genre. I don't know why but it is one of my favorites.
B0094M68BA|5.0|If you love Norman Reedus (and I know that you do!) you NEED to watch this movie! Even if you don't, It's a great movie. :)
B008YW5RH2|5.0|This is a fairly basic to play game with pretty good computer cartoon graphics of parodies of actual tennis players for you to play against.  You don't move your player around the court, that happens automatically, you simply swing the racket with your finger.  This makes it a lot easier than if you had to move the player too which may or may not appeal to you. Serving is a bit hard not to miss and loose a point through a double fault if you try anything other than a soft serve (done by double tapping your finger quickly). But I guess if you practiced enough you could probably work out how to do better serves.<br /><br />It's quite enjoyable, if your a fan of tennis you'll enjoy it.  Like playing real tennis you can get over mentally a game before you have played out the whole set and it is over.<br /><br />You don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this once it is downloaded which is always good to come across.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|How's this for redundancy: these guys are an amazing group of talented musicians who've created a masterpiece. I'm just grateful that I was able to catch them in concert before they hit the big-time stadium scene.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I found this book helpful as I navigate governmental hierarchy and men in power attempting to hold on to power in my work. What I found most significant was her call for women to help other women. I do think she blamed women a bit too much and didn't focus enough on institutional sexism, however in her preface she does state that the book doesn't address it...so I can't fault her too much. Her book gave me a lot to chew on.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I enjoy the show because the stories lines are interesting and believable. They are not over the top bloody and nasty! Customers should know that the series is addictive....once you start watching the series you will want to watch the next show then the next...<br />It could be compared to other lawyer shows but the personal development of the characters makes it much more interesting.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|A different movie with a different story that challenged Matthew McConaughy's acting ability. He rose to the occasion and provided a believable portrayal of a down and out emotionally challenged individual. The kids were fantastic. I might even watch it again.
B0017313I2|4.0|One of the few ( really only as of now) places online I could buy it to streamto my device/ for my ipad.  Good quality and good movie.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|I think the script tried to hard to be sophisticated but only succeeded in out convoluting itself to the point of confusion. Tom played Tom as usual and Morgan Freeman was reduced to a cameo, but Morgan is great at whatever he does.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie is heart warming and well written. I enjoyed it, it made me laugh and had a good ending.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Watched the older Stallone movie and hated it.  Didn't expect to like this one.  It's not worthy of any major award, but I really liked it.  Acting was good.  Some cheesiness in the action at times, but I'm ok with that, it's a comic book adaptation after all.  Fun movie for me to watch and I recommend it.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Great action, great story, I was surprised at how much I liked it. I defintely recommend it as a great Friday/Saturday night rental.
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|BLAKE EDWARDS at his best, Audry is radiant, a great love story. The scene at the strip club has some of movies best dialog regarding \\"Talent \\"
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|They kill lots of witches in this movie but they also kind of missed the mark. I guess if there is nothing else on, then I would watch this movie, but really only once.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|This book stirred up a very interesting, and at times, heated, conversation at my book club (a group of seven 30+ year-old intelligent women living in Philadelphia) about the topic Piper Kerman brings to light: an every-day girl who made a bad decision...but was caught.  The book is very well written and keeps your attention quite easily.  It's not too long, however if you're waiting for the climax....don't.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE it. I use my kindle when I go to church to look up scripture. It is so handy to have instead of carrying a large Bible. I would recommend this version to everyone. There are many versions from KJ, NIV, NASB, NJK, NLT the Message and lots more.
1781162646|4.0|Joyland is in many ways a typical Stephen King novel - young man coming of age by facing some supernatural adversity.  However, with Joyland, he was able to keep it fresh by focusing on the relationships instead of the mystery and ultimate showdown for more than 60% of the story.<br /><br />Our narrator, Devin Jones, is in his 60s and tells us the story of the summer he went to North Carolina and worked at Joyland - a small amusement park.  His is a story of heartache, friendship and spooky ghosts.<br /><br />Overall it is an excellent book.  I especially loved the friendship between Devin, Tom and Erin (two other summer workers).  And, Annie and Mike - King really knows how to break your heart while making you feel warm and fuzzy at the same time.  Mike is a special little boy and I wish I knew him.  Each character is so well written that you feel that you are right there with them.  I wanted to ride the Carolina Spin with Mike and experience his excitement first hand.<br /><br />King's writing rarely causes any issues for me as a reader.  We usually click.  But, there were a few very minor things that bothered me in Joyland.  First, the word \\"ideations\\" is used multiple times.  Maybe I am being picky but when it seems that a writer has a new word that they are trying to use it keeps the prose from flowing for me.  Also, it's pretty clear through most of the book that the park is in North Carolina.  When Devin asks one of his trainers about licensing he says, \\"In South Carolina, a valid DLs all you need.\\"  Contrary to popular belief the Carolinas are not interchangeable.<br /><br />Aside from my pickiness, I did really enjoy this one and would recommend it highly.  4/5 stars.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|This movie was a perfect combination of humor, seriousness, and absolute silliness (a la Steve Carell).  I had no idea what to expect, but can say that I loved it and cannot stop thinking about it several weeks later.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I really love this movie, and I won't spend time criticizing every little thing wrong with this movie compared to the original, especially since the originals had just as many holes if not more between story lines. This film was well written, well directed, and just well rounded. I would recommend this movie to all Star Trek fans, and all proposed fans!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I can't seem to make this app work.  Maybe I'll try again but frankly I spend more time reading than going on Facebook, which I love.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Slow moving but suspenseful. It was an unexpected ending.  Didn't care for some of the characters, like the<br />girl.  Think they could of picked someone else to play it better
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|We really love this movie and think the only sad part, is that there is only one more to be made.  We watch it often and are really looking forward to the next one.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|It was rather violent and bloody.  Kids should not be watching it.  Lots of action and moves<br />along pretty good.
1118273052|5.0|I like the story so far, I'm new to investing and I don't really know alot so I like how he tells his story of growth and learning from so many different personalities.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season does a good job at showing how humanity can be threatened under such extreme conditions.  Very exciting and I can't wait for season 4!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A wonderful story that reveals the culture, hardships and their commitment to family.  The book constantly keeps you wondering about which character the author has chosen to write about.  The letter Nabi writes brings the whole story together.  Finally a sad yet comforting reunion is experienced by only one of the siblings.  Though continents apart, the remaining family reunites.  I was not able to put down this book.
B0026QC0TA|5.0|John Grisham is a great author and storyteller.  I usually read his books but it was a rainy day and I needed a good movie to watch--I loved it!!!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This was a good book to read and recommend to other people, hope next book comes out soon, can wait until then.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Overall great game. good for passing time. Would definitely recommend if you like this type of game. Give it a try.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|What A7X hardcore fans should realize about this album: The Rev (may he rest in peace) was the main lyricist. This being said, this music is not as whimsical or quirky as The Rev wrote the other albums. This album has a distinctly more political shade to it. M. Shadows is the main lyricist.<br /><br />The album is a lot slower than I'm used to. The new drummer delivers some good bass pedal beats. But I miss the tight, rapid beats with the technical edge. The change of tempos is lost. Which makes me sad. I do believe the music was a better quality when the drummer for Dream Theater took over for a brief period. The beat in this album is more like a steady march than the madness which The Rev used to produce.<br /><br />Another thing that's noticeable is that Synyster's guitar playing is a lot less technical/creative. Either that, or it sounds a lot like Metallica. Which isn't bad, but it's unusual. They tried to go for the Black Sabbath/Led Zepplin feel, I just hear more Fade to Black with less \\"ohh yeah\\" guitar solos.<br /><br />A good album...if you're not a die hard. A good album if you remember The Rev is gone. A good album if you've never heard their previous albums.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I read this book bc my daughter had to read it for summer reading before her junior year and said it was really good.  I agree! The characters and description if the circus was great!<br />I would recommend this book to tennis and adults alike.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Great read. As usual, I couldn't put it down. I always appreciate Adichie's ability to tell a story. Fun and enlightening to read a Nigerian perspective on American culture.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Not much of a story, similar to the first book, sex,sex and more sex. The writing got lost somewhere along the way.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent script and acting.  I watched all of seasons 1 thru 3 on my computer in just a couple of days!  I can't wait to see season 4.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|The book is really keeping the tone of the Ender's Game. The issues presented are different to those from the first book but in the same good approach and if you were ok with style from the first one, you won't be disappointed. The only downside is that there is a number of editing errors throughout the book (Kindle edition)
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|After watching The Wire for a second time and Justified, we were afraid we had been spoiled too much to get \\"addicted\\" to another TV series. My search for other Walton Goggins' projects led me to The Shield. If you are fans of programs like The Wire and Justified, I can unreservedly recommend The Shield. The Wire is still at the top of my all time favorite TV series list but The Shield would comfortably fit in the top five list.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|I love this movie!  It's been one of my favorites since I was  a little girl.  Movie was in perfect condition when it arrived.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|The early rounds are almost mind numbingly easy. But the training keeps your interest. Later rounds quickly become more difficult. Found myself wanting more. Kids love it. So does the wife. Family fun for all.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I have seen the movie twice and find it entertaining. I would recommend it to audiences above the age of 15.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A great little device, even better price. If you don't use it for anything more than YouTube on your TV navigating with your phone, it's an amazing experience. My AV receiver has HDMI inputs, and I've found it's a great way to watch music videos with great sound.<br /><br />Also great if your setup box is suffering from an outdated or crippled Netflix interface, or if you want to watch Netflix on a TV without a set top box/blu ray player.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. I especially love the menu, playing with (antagonizing)the minion is hilarious! The levels are very challenging,and the power boosts are hysterical.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|It really was a joy to read this book and I learned a lot about things that hadn't ever occurred to me! Definitely recommend giving it a read.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I really like this game..it can get hard at times but I still like it. it works really good on my kindle fire.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Addictive fun that never ends.  Just when any boredom is felt, a new exciting room to conquer will test your luck, patience and friendship skills.
B00BEIYMTW|3.0|Agree with the previous reviewer hwrose the first half hour is slow but it picks up. my 5 year old son and 4 year old nephew loved it, nephew cried when it was done. vanilla to an adult but your young ones will love it over all 3.5. The film had its share of struggles with delayed launch and the orig dusty quitting at the last minute, and it showed. perhaps planes 2 will be better planned.
B00DW36G32|3.0|Great actors, and its an interesting storyline. The ending was not what I thought, but it was different then the usual.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is a great game that is perfect for any age.  When my little cousins first got this app, I was unsure of it, because they are so young. Later, I realized that, after I played it, it was fun. I kept it on my kindle and every time I'm visiting, they ask for it, just to play it.  It's a great application for children to adults.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I didn't start watching until a few shows in when it first came out. I needed to see it from the start and really liked it. I just wish the later seasons were free.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|i like it because u have to dodge stuff but i think u die way to easy other then that a good game.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I decided to try this product even if it has some negative feedbacks.  I only have tried once, but from the 4 bottles I was trying to cut I was able to get only a half of one wine bottle.  Something to consider is that this product will only work with round shapes. Bottles that are semi-square won't do well (sadly).  I will try again and update this review if my experience with this product improve.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's very sad but it's a great story. One months best books I've ever read. I have a different view of everything now.
0061433063|5.0|A great book in perfect condition and received a couple days before the predicted delivery date.  Terry Pratchett never fails to entertain, either!  If you love the Discworld series, don't miss this one!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I was thrilled when this was on my kendel. It was great to see it without any commercials.I want to see more.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|normally I write fairly long reviews, but I think I can get through this one pretty quickly.  There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over. Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable. The performances are all nearly perfect.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|This movie is stunning. Everything about it is just wonderful! Definitely my favorite movie of all time! Baz Luhrman is the greatest director!
B001N3OJEG|5.0|Normally I write fairly long reviews, but I think I can get through this one pretty quickly. The plot is especially remarkable. It involves well-worn themes from Mafia films like honor, revenge, family and the desire to get away from this violent world, and the characters are nothing particularly new either.  There's certainly nothing wrong with this plot, and it has some fine lines and a few particularly affecting scenes, but it's nothing to get to overly worked up over. Still, the sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable. The performances are all nearly perfect, the score, while perhaps overly conventional, is powerful and emotive, the cinematography is consistently stunning and the period detail is utterly convincing. Again, this is a world we've seen before, but it's more fully realized then ever before, and it makes the film nearly mesmerizing even in the scenes where little is actually going on. Also, there's one scene late in the film, a firefight in the streets during fierce storm, which is simply breath taking. It's definitely one of the most powerful examples of pure cinema I've seen in a long time.
B00992CF6W|3.0|You don't get to build the nether and can't collect red stone I mean it's ok but it also kinda sucks

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The character Wade, feels like the average guy that you know, whose luck, makes him an instant on line celebrity, that's dealing with a lot of stuff, from fans to new relationships, it's a page turner.  As a geek, I know how it feels to be different from your peers due to my love of video-games, comics and sci-fy
B006RXQ800|5.0|Normally I write fairly long reviews, but I think I can get through this one pretty quickly. The plot of Gangs of NY is not especially remarkable. It involves well-worn themes from Mafia films like honor, revenge, family and the desire to get away from this violent world, and the characters are nothing particularly new either.

B00ET47USI|5.0|This game was easy to learn and entertaining with the animation.  I think anyone who likes solitaire games will love this.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|The sheer craft displayed herein makes the film remarkable.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I like the recent format update.  Good map.  Use it for local and to keep up w/weather of family and friends elsewhere.
B00BFUC8RC|1.0|this app stinks. It is stupid. please do knot buy it.I played for one day and the I deleted it
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I have watched many, many multi-season TV shows on the internet: The Soprano's, Boston Legal, The Wire, THe Good Wife, etc., but have never seen a show as compelling as Dexter. Fascinating on so many levels, it is the story of a young boy who's childhood trauma is so extreme that he loses his humanity and develops sociopathic tendencies.  But the most compelling part of the story to me is the ongoing process he is involved in in trying to understand, and mimic what the behaviors of normal people are in, what appears to be an attempt to restore his humanity and live a normal life. This show gets all the stars for its compelling premise, the incredible acting, and complex storylines.
B000V39KDO|4.0|Purchased as a gift. Technology today allows access to almost every movie out there. Purchased to send an inspirational message to family competeing in a &#34;Spartan Run.&#34; Movie tells a fictionalized story of an actual event. Warriors full of heart against insumountable odds that realize victory does not always include winning. Very different and interesting visual approach.
B00BB8T9FC|5.0|This movie moves me to tears each time I see it (and I've lost track of the number of times I have seen it).  The performances are pitch perfect and the script touches the heart.  If you're having a bad day, rent this movie and it will bring a sweet smile to your lips.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I cannot get enough of this series and it has been seriously cutting into my study time. Definitely not a book for children considering the contents and the myriad of names that must be memorized.
B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|Maybe it will take more time to fall into the flow of a few more songs besides Power and All of the Lights.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|helps get out some pent up aggression and helps you fell like a winner for that much needed confidence boost
B004Q3SGWG|5.0|I enjoyed this movie because it paints an accurate picture of what actually happened, according to the real life character.  Viewers will not come away disappointed.  Teaches you to value life and never give up!
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very good overview of the historical period, had never really understood the context of the Jewish revolt and Roman retribution, very good scholarly discussion
B0017SWPXY|5.0|All animal lovers will enjoy this.  Easy to read and keeps your interest. Very enjoyable. I recommend this wonderful book.
B00908DDZM|5.0|The Heist is definitely one of my all time favorite albums. Macklemore has a way with words that is so unique to rappers.<br /><br />Delivery was quick.
B00AEFYK5M|5.0|I consider this movie a must have for my collection of best loved Love Stories!  The chemistry in this movie is great and the timing so perfect.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|You know when you get one of those albums where EVERY SINGLE SONG IS AMAZING!? Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those. This kid is walking in the footsteps of Bob Dylan.<br /><br />Delivery was fast and package was well packed. Thank you.
B000002W9Q|4.0|Same sounds that bring back the days in which the tunes were popular.  The movie was a &#34;chick flick&#34; but the music is great.  Price was fair and delivery prompt.
1878424319|5.0|I recomend this book to just about every person regardless whether they're depressed or pessimistic. This book brings a completely different way of viewing life so that: &#34;In the middle of hell you can still live in your own heaven&#34;.
0345349571|5.0|My son gave me a copy of this book to read a few years ago. The way MS. Tuchman wrote this book was wonderful. She was able to take a very sketchy part of history and bring it altogether in a way that made it all come to life for me. I lost my copy and I bought this for my dad to read. He is history buff and also thinks the book explaines a great deal in a very, explicit way of what happened to Europe during this dark time. I highly recommend this book and I will probably read my dads copy again when he is through.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|This is something I wish I downloaded for free and not paid for. The is one of the bad ones. For the past few years he have falling off.
B004BJMEO6|4.0|haven't had a chance to see the rest of the movie to comment yet, but what I saw of it, it was fair
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|One of my favorite match 3 games. Vibrant colors and challenging  puzzles .  Love decorating the fish tanks with beautiful fish and decor . I never get tired  of playing
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I am very disappointed but all this app wants me to do is BUY_BUY_BUY more tokens!  Won't work unless I do! Didn't count on this at all!  Now I am getting the same thing from the ALISA BINGO!  What goes here?  Is this what &#34;FREE&#34; is?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|We'll written. It literally transports you to the places he describes and you can feel what each one of the characters feel.  Loved it.
B0090X4GLW|3.0|Songs are straight from the movie.  If you enjoyed the music from the movie the this is for you. I prefer original hits.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|The Face of this watch is big and beautiful.  AND the location of the knobs on the left is important so that they don't jab your wrist like my other big face watches.  i would definitely recommend this watch, but was not a huge fan of the cloth (and part leather) wrist band.  i'd prefer a synthetic band or all cloth....but its something we can change out.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I think this was a pretty good book.  It is interesting and since he's a doctor it seem so much more believable.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We had heard so much about the show we did not want to see the 4th season without reviewing the previous seasons, so we ordered season 1,2,&3. We are hooked, cannot wait for season 4.<br />Sheila
B003G4W49C|5.0|Started reading this after hearing about the movie coming out.  So far I've read the entire quintet and am going to finish the entire series.  Loved them all so far.
B0070DQZ86|5.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed this movie when it first came out, despite Christian Slater's annoying performance and Costner's strange interpretation of an English accent, I remember feeling there were gaps that needed to be filled in (e.g. Rickman's relationship with the hag, the attack in a supposedly haunted forest, etc.); this director's cut does the job!<br />  Rickman is brilliant (over-the-top, but brilliant), and the action scenes are very well done. The movie proceeds at a sprightly pace, despite the length. Colors are vivid and the sound is great!
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Started reading this after hearing about the movie coming out.  So far I've read the entire quintet and am going to finish the entire series.  Loved them all so far.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series is superb--in a long dull summer of horrible reality shows this series tells about a historic segment of English life without being either dry or dull.  There is pathos as well as humor...Absolutely wonderful.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I selected this book for many reasons: Love the author's books/style, stumbled onto the PET CEMETERY movie shoot site while visiting friends in Maine,  and checked out the reviews at Amazon.com. Never disappointed and always enjoy a great read! IT is it!  Don't miss IT.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|This book has clear photos and instructions, as well as suggestions for alternatives.  It is a must-have for one's knitting reference collection.  And there is an e-version!
B000FA675C|4.0|If these &#34;facts&#34; are true, it says a lot about Catholic authority.<br />Nicely written, can't pot it down once you get into it.
140006922X|5.0|Excellent chronicle for anyone interested in reading an objective study of the volatile socio-political conditions during Jesus' lifetime.<br /><br />Dr. Aslan's respectful examination of the gospels maintains defined separation between issues of faith and historical record.<br /><br />At no time does the author dispute the faithful's right to worship.  Anyone who gave this book a one star review, simply could not have read it's contents.  Even if one disagrees with Dr. Aslan's research, the academics involved in compiling this study is praiseworthy.<br /><br />The book is beautifully composed with a flow that demands page turning. I found that it validated my understanding of the biblical texts while introducing a fascinating new (new to me) vista of additional linguistic, cultural and historical facts.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Some graphic violent scenes, but overall a fascination story.<br />A good read.<br />A example of what might happen if someone could change the past.
B008532S54|5.0|Funny funny funny.  This movie was good fun and will make you laugh:) I laughed more than I have in a long time watching a movie.
B007MDB71O|5.0|When this film first hit the theaters I passed on it because of the trailer.<br /><br />I am glad I gave it a shot on DVD, great film wish they were already making a sequel. If you have not checked out John Carter give it a shot, buy it or rent it. Hopefully they end up making enough revenue out of the theater they decide to take a chance at a second and even third movie.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Adorable movie - the kids ages 5, 6, and 8 all enjoyed it! Mom and Dad had a few laughs as well.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Good family movie. Well written and good cast. Will recommend it to my family and friends.Four more words required. One more word required.
159463176X|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book after the emotional roller coaster I went through with the kite runner. Don't get me wrong, I loved the kite runner and couldn't put it down, but the brutality and cruelty of people that was described in the book has haunted me years after reading it. that's also why I haven't read a thousand splendid suns yet either.<br /><br />So, I wasn't sure I wanted to go through that again, even though I knew he was an amazing author. But after previewing the first couple chapters online, I couldn't stop reading it.<br /><br />I read this book in 4 days, that's super quick for me! I really loved parts of it and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am just in awe of hosseini as a storyteller and writer. I wish I knew how he sucks you into the story so well!<br /><br />Problems I had with the book though:<br />While the stories all intertwined, I almost felt like I wish he would have told us more about some characters Abdullah as a teenager, for example, rather than having small snippets of stories of so many characters. I just wanted to know more of the story on almost all of the characters.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love movies that show how life was in the past.<br />Excellent scenery and costume. Would recommend this show to 13 and older
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game! its so awesome. the dragons are really cool. there are plant, seasonal, themes, and lots of other types of dragons. :)
B003MOHX8S|5.0|Silly how they make you type something.  I like this music.  Ten more words required.  Saffron.  Umbrella.  Unicorn. Monkey's Uncle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series can't wait for season 4. Great actors and scenery keep you guessing what's gonna happen next. Definitely worth watching
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Downloaded on all my tablets and smartphones. Easy and accurate application. Recommend to anyone with children in school to verify their math homework.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins doesn't mess around. There's no wasted action here and the whole book is like a roller coaster ride. I was sad to finish it. I would have liked a little more insight into what was happening with the other characters and how the rest of the outside world was dealing with the drastic changes in their lives while Katniss was going through her mental breakdown period at the end but I was never bored and will surely pick up this trilogy in a few years and read it all again. That to me is the truest sign of a really great book.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Usually the books are much better than the movies, but I enjoyed this movie, every bit as much.  I recommend it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|So many surprises but everything fit together and nothing seemed to be forced. I almost screamed when I got to the end because I just had to know what was going to happen next. Had to buy book 3 and start it immediately.
159463176X|5.0|Mr. Hosseini is a great storyteller.  This intricately woven tale, which begins with a beloved sister torn away from her brother because of an Afghan family's poverty, ends with a meeting late in their lives on another continent.  The multiple sequelae of this separation are the subject of this wonderful tale.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this movie. The plot was great. A love story without any inappropriate scenes and no bad language.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|As a life long fan of al the Star Trek variations, I am very pleased with the continuing saga of Kirk, Spock & USS 1701, and revisiting story lines from the original series with the time twist introduced in the last film. Very well done! It is with great anticipation that I await the next chapter in this saga. I doubt I will ever tire of it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|A good book and start to a good story. I can't wait to read more.  Thankfully I already have the next book downloaded. :)
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Amazing show, great storyline. Not for the squeamish or bashful! Beautifully shot. Enjoying it thoroughly. Highly recommended. A++ Get it today.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Good clean sounding amplifier for headphones. This is my first headphone amp and I really didn't know what to expect. This amp will get loud so set it properly. My only true gripe about this is the bass boost is too high in the frequency range (60-80hz) for my liking, I wantred more like a 40hz and under boost, but perhaps I'm asking to much from a headphone amp...Overall good sound and great for beginners getting into the headphone hobby.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|does not allow you to continue playing when out of bubbles and is very frustrating to use.  Will not continue to play the game.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Unbelievable, whenever I think about concentration camps and situations that are beyond my control, where others want to hurt or kill me because of who my parents are and my blood line my first instinct would be to fight back. But being born in a camp and not knowing anything about the outside world, or even knowing it existed is completely different. I could almost feel what he went through. When I think about North Korea and south Korea's indifference, it just gets me mad. What shin went through is horrific. We all need to fight to liberate north Korea.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Guess the Emoji is very addictive. I wish I could move forward when stuck and come back to it later on!
0345525558|5.0|Very well done; carefully edited and terribly relevant. The characters are beautifully entwined in a difficult, often painful story. I cried more than once while reading this lovely book. The artful ending left me refreshed and hopeful.  I look forward to more from Vanessa Diffenbaugh.

B009XIXVU6|1.0|The book was chore to read. I enjoyed Hosseini's first book , The Kite Runner; but this one was not an enjoyable read.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I know, I know.  That was # 9's line, but seriously this series just keeps getting better and better.  The writing is tight and keeps me on the edge of my seat.  I can't wait to play the next episode as each one finishes.  I think I will go into withdrawal when I catch up to mid-season 7.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book. It's a different story than you might be thinking. It comes back to how well one knows their husband. Hye characters were nicely developed. I recognize this busy life of a family with kids. If you find a letter and it says to open only upon my death.  Would you open it?  A most enjoyable quick read - perfect for vacation
0399159347|5.0|What a wonderful author who explores with humor and insight the gray areas of life. Humans with all our quirky ways. I could not put this book down.
0192853619|5.0|Covers the topics that I was interested in reading about.<br />This book appears to be an original work by the author, although there may be<br />other similar titles.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Yeah, so it's a typical comic-book-turned-into-a-movie-superhero flick.<br />Many of which have been done better - like the X-Men and both Iron-Man flicks.
B00B9ZBZ2C|5.0|I loved this book. Child 44 is wonderfully plotted. The story is gripping from start to finish. I just purchased Tom Rob Smith's two other books in the trilogy and can't wait to read them.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Reading this is keeping me in the Thrones world until it returns on HBO.<br />Series is so true to this book.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie for any Marvel comics fan, movie met all my expectations. Iron man and Thor are well played favorites.
B005LJJESY|3.0|The movie starts off well and ends horribly. This is what happens when you have a terrible script, or a script with too much directoral leaway with a direct that doesn't quite grasp the story line, or is pulled in too many directions to put stuff in a movie that shouldn't or doesn't need to be there.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I got the Chromecast to watch Netflix on a larger screen than an iPad or computer and hopefully reduce the Comcast charges for OnDemand movies the kids rack up. It took me less than 5 minutes to set up with my home WIFI and is working perfectly. I'm very happy with it.

1119963192|5.0|I am a recreational swimmer who tried to relearn to swim better back in 1998 from Terry Laughlin's book. I have never been on a swim team to get good coaching advice.<br /><br />I have recently looked at a few new and old how-to-swim books. The newer advice is quite different from the older books which encouraged habits that can easily lead to shoulder injuries.<br /><br />1)<br />A new book \\"Swim Smooth\\" has the most modern advice of all, along with a fine web site swimsmooth.com with a super free app you can download and watch from any angle and at very slow speed (esp from underneath to see the difference from the old S-shape recommended arm movement for the crawl). Looking through this book a few days ago already has led to a major revision of my freestyle.<br />You can get the essential info from this fun book by just looking at the numerous pictures and reading the captions.<br />My self-taught freestyle stroke has several major flaws, eg. I should not angle my hand sideways on entry which can injure the shoulder and I should not cross the center line on arm extension or pushback (some old books show the arm crossing horizontally under the body) which loses propulsion and leads to being off balance. The entry angle should be at a steep approx 45 degree angle and the hand should tip down for the catch right after full extension (instead of gliding more). And forget about a sideways scull and S-shape arm movement (update: I have added back a partial S movement which seems to flow better with increased speeds if you use fins, plus Olympic swimmers do that too).<br />Anyway, the book \\"Swim Smooth\\" and web site (with the downloaded MrSmooth app) is my top choice for a relearn-to-swim-freestyle book for amateurs who have no coach.<br /><br />2)<br />Next in line is the excellent second edition of \\"Fitness Swimming\\", pages 1-69, page 86, and pages 119-120 (the rest is workout schedules). This book has by far the best compact explanation of the theory and guidelines for the modern injury-free freestyle . It finally explained to me exactly how to accomplish the 2-beat kick as well as the unfathomable (from other books) 6-beat kick.<br /><br />3)<br />Then there's the other modern swim book that I re-learned to swim from in 1998. Too bad in that book (or even his latest one) there is no good description of the arc the hand travels (ie. S-shape or not) or fundamental principles like the hand must always be inside the elbow distance (otherwise .. injury) and the similar dangers of angling the hand on entry, or of the merits of a steeper hand entry (but see his DVD below). Terry Laughlin's books (latest best all-stroke intro is called \\"Extraordinary Swimming for every body\\") have been adopted widely and I still would recommend this book as one of the several must-have's for someone still learning to swim better. If I was teaching someone to swim from ground zero, I would use the exercises to lead up to the crawl in that book's freestyle chapter (which are easier to see/appreciate in the bigger format \\"Total Immersion Pool Primer\\", basically drills in balance and body rotation) or in Terry's DVD \\"Perpetual Motion Freestyle in 10 Lessons\\", which teaches how to swim by progressive enhancement of fundamental balance and propulsion skills. The graduated drills are clearly demonstrated and the progression to developing the complete stroke and 2-beat flick kick is logical.<br /><br />4)<br />\\"Learn to Swim in a Weekend\\" is a super compact (90 pages), all-picture guide to the major strokes plus turning and diving, about 8 easy to look at pages per stroke type. This is a fun book to look through and the pictures are superb in showing the essentials of each stroke.<br /><br />So those are the 4 most essential how-to-swim or how-to-relearn-to-swim-better books I've discovered.<br /><br />Then there's the very old swimming book \\"Swimming: Steps to Success\\" which has some bad crawl advice (which was considered good advice in the 1960's), but includes a few non-major strokes such as the sidestroke and the Double Trudgen which I'll learn sometime to amaze folks - I mean, who really knows that stroke nowadays other than ocean lifeguards! The third edition of this book has not changed from the very old first edition, so do not expect modern swimming advice.<br /><br />History: the first-ever \\"modern\\" swim book was \\"Complete Book of Swimming\\" by James Counsilman (1979) which authors since have liberally copied text from. This was \\"the\\" modern theory and how to swim book until the 1990's and has held up remarkably well, plus it's fun to see pictures of Mark Spitz's swim strokes.udes a few non-major strokes such as the sidestroke and the Double Trudgen which I'll learn sometime to amaze folks - I mean, who really knows that stroke nowadays other than ocean lifeguards!

1781162646|3.0|Joyland takes place in 1973 against the backdrop of a haunted amusement park, and chronicles Devon Jones's experiences working there during college. The story is comprised of several subplots: the legend of the girl murdered on the haunted house ride, Devon's friendship with a single mother whose young son is dying from muscular dystrophy, Devon's heartache over a breakup with his first girlfriend, and the bonds of comradery he forms with his fellow carny workers.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were set too high because--I don't know, because King is supposed to be a master writer? In any case, as a Stephen King fan, I was pretty disappointed. While Joyland is more or less passable as a piece of fiction, it lacks the drama, tension, and psychological insight found in  many of King's earlier works. The creep factor is relatively low for a ghost story, and the characters felt underdeveloped and uninteresting. If you haven't read King's works before, don't start here. Try The Shining or 'Salem's Lot first.

1475972350|1.0|Thank goodness I only spent $.99 on this book.  I thought with 4.5 stars it would be a good read, and could have been had the author written in a professional style.  The description of the book made the storyline seem different and imaginative but after the first few chapters it was obvious where the story was going.  Most of the dialogue between the characters was immature and sounded very adolescent.  I had to force myself to finish this book.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Very nice sets and great acting helped peak my interest in this story.  The writing is well done and creates interest in the history of England during the WW1 period.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Kline is very skilled in weaving several story lines at a time. I didn't know anything about the orphan trains before reading this novel. This is a good read couldn't put it down. It recognizes how  children may accept their fate but when given the right support they can rise above it.
B008602KQI|3.0|DISCLAIMER: I haven't read the books...<br />I guess it's difficult to take a movie adaptation of a book and not make it look or sound scripted, but it was almost cheesy in this movie. Lawrence's emotions are a little forced in this movie and I think she does better in others. The effects and the environment was well-made and in some scenes I could believe that this world existed. Overall, not a bad movie, but it was too scripted for my tastes.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|This series has some of the best stories I have ever seen. They also keep the ongoing sagas going quite well. It has been one of the best TV series I have had the opportunity to enjoy. You have to be careful or you will wind up binge watching. :)

Archer does a superb job of outlining his characters and then the story flows well after that.  It was a WOW all the way.  The third book, \\"Best Kept Secret\\" hasn't been completed yet.  They are compelling tales and I had a hard time putting them down.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />Flo Philips

0307743721|5.0|It isn't that Munro's STORIES are so good, because they're not remarkable at all, really.  What's remarkable is how well she perceives little interactions and then communicates them so effectively to the reader.  So often - especially in \\"Haven,\\" for instance - someone does or says something and you understand the situation she's conveying, but then Munro as the narrator says something that confirms it to you:  this is what that REALLY means, and you find yourself saying, yes, we're really on the same page here, you've really nailed that perception or that person or the attitudes in that world precisely.  It's that kind of intimacy with her that's so thrilling.  It feels intimate and universal at the same time, mainly because she's so absolutely awesome in making you understand not only the character but their entire world.  Her complete oeuvre of stories is one of the greatest treasure troves in the entire language.
0765348780|5.0|I downloaded this book from the kindle store probably about 2 years ago.  A lot of people had said good things about it so I gave it a try... and quickly got frustrated and bored.  Luckily, I had the second to last Wheel of Time book left to read so I read that.  After I finished Towers of Midnight, I thought I'd give Gardens of the Moon another go, but the characters didn't seem significant, and I didn't care when they were inevitably dispatched.  So I set this one down and read through a few more fantasy series, took a hiatus from reading here and there, and eventually gave Gardens of the Moon a final go.<br /><br />Well, somewhere between half and two-thirds of the way through the book, things started to make sense, the writing smoothed itself out, and I found I actually cared.  When I finished it, even with the early difficulty getting into the story, I felt what I had read was as good as the great books I had read in the interim, including The Way of Kings, The Name of the Wind, and The Night Angel trilogy.<br /><br />I would repeat the recommendation of another reviewer: don't worry if you don't get it at first, just keep going and things will start to make more sense.

B00DB624GS|4.0|Some might find it hard to believe that before their success with albums such as Rumours and Tusk, Fleetwood Mac was actually a blues rock band then they were formed by guitarist Peter Green in 1967. Fleetwood Mac's third album, Then Play On, is often considered by many to be their best effort when Green was in the band. The album is also the last the band would make with Green, as he left the band a year after the album's release in 1970. Now in 2013, the album has been reissued and remastered with the original UK tracking list and segues.<br /><br />Fleetwood Mac was formed in 1967 by guitarist Peter Green. With Green was guitarist Jeremy Spencer, bassist John McVie and drummer Mick Fleetwood. Green named the band using the surnames of the band's rhythm section of McVie and Fleetwood. By 1969, the band had released two studio albums- a self-titled debut and Mr. Wonderful. Both efforts were simple blues rock albums and good enough for the band to make a name for themselves. It was also around this time the band added a third guitarist, Danny Kirwin. The band soon achieved success with a hit single in the UK, the instrumental \\"Albatross\\".<br /><br />An album like Then Play On was a huge step for the band. Green decided that while sticking to their blues roots, why not dabble in progressive rock? \\"Coming Your Way\\" is a great intro and fits with the album cover painted by Maxwell Armfield. Green, Spencer and Kirwin all get to shine on this track. Blues comes in the form of the instrumental \\"Fighting for Madge\\", Kirwin's 12-bar \\"One Sunny Day\\", the boogie riddled \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\", and the sorrowful \\"Like Crying\\". Songs such as \\"Closing My Eyes\\", \\"Without You\\" and \\"When You Say\\" are beautiful ballads while \\"Underway\\" and \\"Searching for Madge\\" create this a sort of psychedelic atmosphere.<br /><br />As for the sound, it's fantastic. Then Play On is an album that has been retooled and messed with by the record labels for years. As mentioned before, this reissue is a remaster of the UK version. The US version was released twice in 1969. Both versions omitted songs from the UK version and rearranged segues. For example, the giggle at the start of \\"Like Crying\\" is moved to the end of \\"Searching for Madge\\". When first released on CD in 1990, the album was changed up again. While mostly following the US versions, the segues were put in different places and once again, omitted several songs.<br /><br />One major criticism of the 1990 issue that had fans complaining was the sound quality of the digital transfer, citing that there was too much hiss and distortion. I've done several sound comparisons of the 1990 issue and the new remaster. The 1990 version sounds much louder but very hissy and perhaps a little too much reverb. The new remaster does not sound distorted nor does it sound hissy. In fact, it sounds perfect. I've never heard the original vinyl but I can believe this is what people heard back in 1969. There's no need to worry about any massive clipping either.<br /><br />There are a few bonuses with this reissue. Insightful liner notes are written by Rolling Stone senior editor David Fricke and there are a few bonus tracks. First, there's the band's hit single \\"Oh Well\\". Unlike the 1990 issue in which the track as one nine minute track, the song is split into its original two parts like the original 45 single. Also on is another single, \\"The Green Manalishi (With the Two Prong Crown)\\" and its B-side \\"World in Harmony\\". The former may sound familiar as it was covered by Judas Priest in 1979 while the latter is seeing its debut appearance on CD.<br /><br />If you were disappointed by the 1990 issue of Then Play On, this is a no brainer: get this remaster immediately. If you are a stranger to Fleetwood Mac's bluesy beginnings, Then Play On is a pretty good place to start.master of the UK version. The US version was released twice in 1969.

If you are a stranger to Fleetwood Mac's bluesy beginnings, Then Play On is a pretty good place to start.
B000002JPA|3.0|Bought this because online it beat out Metallica's Master of Puppets for most iconic metal album. It was not better than master of puppets.
B0052REUW0|4.0|I like Steven Pinker's books, but this one took me longer to finish. It could have been shorter, I guess.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This solved my problem with not being able to charge my Kindle Fire. I thought it was my kindle but rather just the charger.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Judging by the shows cover and even it's description I thought it was going to be boring but this show is awesome!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This was a phenomenal 1st book and it ranks up there with &#34;The Way Of Kings&#34; and cant wait till the 2nd one in the series comes out.
B005EHILV4|4.0|Very useful on the go. If you want the &#34;best sound quality&#34; then pay more and stop criticizing Behringer. For someone who can not afford BIG name brands this works out exelent
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I was a little worried when I first started this book but about halfway thru it really starts to come together and is turning out to be a phenomenal series.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This is the coolest app on earth. I like all the gun simulator apps that they made so far. They are the coolest.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was funny I can't wait to the next one to come out<br />If there is a next one
B000XUBFE2|4.0|This book definitely has you thinking outside of the box. Not sure I'd read it again, but it was definitely a good read
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This was a great movie and I loved many of the songs.  Played fine on my DVD player so all was well.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love playing this on my kindle! such a fun game and it doesn't get boring to play at all. it's definitely more challenging than the original. Love it!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|My dad was in the Army in WWII.  He was in France, Belgium and Germany.  He never fired his M1 and always talked about how cold he was and how confused he was.  A grunt had no idea what was going on and, usually, just wanted to go home.  My dad had a wife and 3 children and was drafted.  He said the only reason he didn't desert before he left the US was he knew the Army would come after him and he didn't want to embarrass himself and his family.  My uncle was an 18 year old kid when he joined the Marines in WWII in time to fight on Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  Sledge's experiences with filth, terror and the daily slug killing and seeing your brother Marines killed mirror some of the things my uncle experienced.  I was in the Navy in the early 1960s.  Sailors and Marines were always at loggerheads and I had little respect for them then.  I knew nothing of Marine experiences and sacrifices in the Pacific.  I've read 168 WWII Kindle books since December 2011 and the books have made me thankful we had the WWII generation.  And, thank goodness we had the Marines in the Pacific as they fought and defeated a vicious and cruel enemy in the Japanese Army.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I didn't finish the book because it didn't grab my attention the way I needed it to in the first few chapters.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|it was well written and I wanted to read it before the movie came out.  I enjoyed it and am now completing the series.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This movie has it all:  an insightful perspective, well-crafted story and expert production with attention to detail that is truly impressive and a guarantee of good entertainment!  The story-telling is superb, the portrayal of the dogs with their translation devices is hilarious, and generally the inter-generational interactions are enjoyable and fun.
B00CLT31D6|3.0|Not a bad book. Nothing really earth shattering information here...plus the book is a bit dated as it talks of times the early-mid 90's.
B006KP3XCQ|5.0|This is a movie I recommend to everyone!  It is an insightful and amusing look at our society where perfectly good things are thrown away far too often and where people too often lose their &#34;backbones&#34; due to lack of physical and civic activity.  This movie is so well crafted that multiple viewings are worthwhile and entertaining.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|I give this a five star rating as it is fast paced and keeps my interest.  I found myself wanting to sit and watch episodes back to back.
0399255370|5.0|I love this book. Its funny, cute, and fun to read even without a child present. I ordered two and recommend to all. Love it!
B005544TRQ|5.0|We cannot get enough of this show. Great story line. I think Harvey is so handsome! We love it. Can't wait for the 3rd season!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so cool. This game entertains u wen your bored! It is just an amazing product. It has his image's, characters surf boards. :D it's just a really fun game.
1250012570|4.0|These days, I feel that the YA is used more as a pejorative than a label for a genre of fiction, but a friend of mine recommended it highly and I thought to give it a try. The writing isn't particularly profound, but it's earnest and I couldn't help but fall in love as Eleanor and Park read comics and listened to the Smiths together. It's actually respectful of young love — Park's parents accept his relationship and seem understanding. I really didn't think I would like this novel, but I ended up loving it. It's a story about young love, but without all the typical drawn-out melodrama. I particularly liked the ending, which was open-ended, but had just the right amount to satisfy the romantic in you.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Never even played the game.  Took too long to load.  It looks like fun but must take a lot of memory.
B00821OX98|5.0|I love the premise, the acting and even most of the special effects.  Great show for what it is.  Good fun
B009AY04A8|5.0|A lot of fun.  I love all the different puzzles within the game.  I would recommend this game to anyone who likes search and find games.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|I felt connected right away. Maybe it's because the author writes similarto me or perhaps I've encountered the same scenario.  Whatever it may be, the flow of sentences are easy to follow, sometimes keeping the reader gripped to the pages from one moment to another. \\"Lucky\\" paints dramatic scenes as well as any day-to-day activities so we remember the author/victim is still human living life in balance faced in a world of good and evil
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is it! This has to be one of the best Bingo games I have ever played.  You get five free games of Tournament Bingo everyday!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|It was such a lovely fiilm I watched it twice in one day,<br />Good enough to buy!  Nuanced performances all around.
B00003CX5P|4.0|Very confusing for one who managed to miss all but one of this mega-successful series when they first came out. Looking to catch up with what had caused all the fuss, one naturally buys Star Wars: Episode I, so as to start at the beginning. Of course, it turns out that it is not actually the beginning of Star Wars as filmed and distributed, it is produced later but is meant to be an earlier book in the series. Imagine a series on the life of George Washington which begins with volume 9,  his last years. So newcomers beware.<br />For most viewers,  I would advise my own policy with regard to reviewers of such series as this.  Ignore them  save with regard to statements as to suitability of content for family viewing, excessive gore, foul language and other elements which turn off some viewers to any film regardless of its merits. In this case, that is no concern, I should think, for it is good 'clean\\" family viewing, violence, but against robots and other machine-like characters (mostly), and an artificiality which removes most action from the realm of the 'real'. There is a plot intended as no more than a framework for the dazzling action scenes, there are clearly delineated Good and Evil characters, there is rich color, beautiful young woman, and handsome young men. There is even a little boy who is central to the plot. Get in on the fun and I doubt that you will care much about the deficiencies as measured by standards for \\"Good and Bad\\" movies.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|THE BEST ACTION MOVIE TO-DATE!!!  I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE SEQUEL!  SUPERMAN & BATMAN WILL BE AWESOME WITH A RETURNING CAST OF SEVERAL & NEW ONES.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Well, the book was pretty tame and the characters tepid compared to the Netflix show.  The book was much more self-serving and by the end of the book I was pretty sure she should have stayed in prison just a little bit longer.  It's an easy and quick read, though, so what the heck - buy the Kindle version...when it goes on sale.
B000HEWEDK|2.0|When ordering the widescreen version I expected I would get the original theatrical version. The advertised &#34;widescreen&#34; was just an expanded view of the full screen version and the key scene of the end of Morbius was still not on the widescreen version. Don't order this if you already have the full screen version. You're not missing anything.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show hands down. It totally keeps you wanting more. I can't wait for the next season to start.  It's a little addictive.
068484267X|5.0|Always kept my attention! Great quick read that touches your heart. Frank McCourt really lets you see into his childhood!
B000SZK41M|4.0|Classic Bruce Willis. Fun to watch, always entertaining. Lots of action. Great older movie to kick back and enjoy with some popcorn.
141690977X|5.0|I did not like the movie but when I ended my relationship earlier this year, the book told it like it was and he just was not that into me - so he got fired! WAMP
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Want a time suck? This is the game for you - fun for both my son and I - generations have tons of fun wasting time with this game.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Movies don't get any better than this one. Loved Gregory Peck recalling Harper's comparison of him to her dad- I won't give it away!
B0089LOG02|5.0|One of a kind, warm and sometimes gut-wrenching. The action of the children in the 1920s sound believable. The cruelty of overseers sounds unpardonable.<br />The journey was more interesting than the ending, but there was not a logical place to end the story.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Before Sunset has the same fantastic actors as Before Sunrise and is equally as good. I would recommend this movie to both young and old adults. Might be too slow moving for the younger set, however.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|I've enjoyed the prior Diehard movies particular the first one with Alan Rickman as a suburb villain.  &#34;A Good Day&#34; has  good story line between the two lead characters, unfortunately the car chases and explosions didn't allow the characters to have enough of the interactions that characterized the first movie.  Maybe dialogue is more difficult than special effects?  Still not bad for a sequel.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book is solid, interesting, makes you think...it's a modern anthem for moving women and men forward in a progressive society
B00280LYIM|5.0|I absolutely love everything about this series! The author is fantastic and I can't wait to read more!!! The characters are well developed and the plot kept me intrigued and entertained!

B005MYWZKM|5.0|Did not think Florence could out do her first album but this has gone above and beyond. Listen to it on a boat. Alone. At night. Lying on your back. Staring at the stars.
0743482832|4.0|I like the way the book is set up with the notes on the left and reading on the right.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love it and so does my three year old. We play it everyday. Since its one of her favs she loves the game even more. Minions all the time.
B00D5EWRHW|5.0|Love the eclectic melange of styles.  If you like Arcade Fire, matched with My Morning Jacket, check this one out.
B0015KO52S|5.0|I like these guys and the variety of songs they play.This is a great albumn and the music style is so different from song to song, just love it, and love pretty much everything Jack White is involved with, he's so talented and so are the other members in this band.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't want the book to end.<br />Besides time traveling back into the 60's with all the details that MADE that era , the story itself was<br />captivating. If you are looking for a typical Steven King novel this isn't one, however it would definitely be<br />In line with his best work.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great actors and actresses.  Good plots, love the legal situations. look forward to watching it every Tuesday Hope there will be another season in 2014.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really interesting. I enjoy having to look around the room to fins things which will help me escape. My only complaint is that it seems a little slow at times.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I like this album a lot. I bought this as a gift for my ex, and she loved it as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My girls got me into it and I am glad they did because I love playing games and trying to beat them....
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have gone through five looong books and I am left with anticipation and anxiety while RR is pumping out other books. Take me back to Westeros and let me live among the Wildings!
B002WNC5BU|5.0|I can't put into words, how well this documentary is. With the thread of music, they pulled the DNA of 3 famous musicians thru a span of 25 years. Every single person whom I suggested this movie to (young or old) loved it!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer winds his plots meticulously and then leaves you hanging. The sadness of the end and the questions left unanswered drive you to the next chapter of the chronicles.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan from way back. This presents a double edge sword. When you change DNA, you better be damn good. This movie continues to move forward the genius of Star Trek. The story line is brilliant, the acting outstanding.
B005BGBPBG|5.0|thave seen this video several times and enjoy it every time I see it.  It is definately a chic flick but is also a feel good movie!!!
B00DURGZHW|5.0|This movie is very well done. Nice angle on the story line. Acting was very good, and I liked the cinematography.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This product is worth every penny, especially since it is only $35.  Easy to set up and using Google Chrome you can cast anything you are viewing to your television.  Simple and effective.
075669812X|4.0|Bought as a gift and was told I'm the best auntie ever. My nephew is 6 and hasn't put the book down! Combined with a lego toy to encourage some reading while playing.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Once you watch the very first episode you are hooked. This show is well written and well played out. I am starting the read on all 5 books right now during downtime between seasons.<br /><br />Its awesome !
B00DHHWXYY|4.0|I actually started this book and gave up on it, because it was just too \\"wordy\\" and therefore a bit boring. (Why do some of these books become \\"classics\\"?  I just don't know).  Anyway, I realize the book was written in the \\"style\\" of the times, and \\"keep it pithy\\" was not their motto.  So I decided to try the movie, just out  of curiosity.  And besides, I like Leonardo!<br /><br />Well!  I was sort of mezmorized, sort of shocked, and sort of turned off a little (too much rap - more on that later).  One thing I WASN'T, was bored! This movie never drags - not once.  Although it may appear a bit frantic and disjointed, it's actually very easy to follow since a lot of it is narrated by the main character (played by Toby Macquire).<br /><br />In the movie, which is set in 1922, a frustrated writer goes to live in NY, and becomes a bonds trader.  He happens to live right next door to Jay Gatsby, a mysterious guy (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who dwells in a huge mansion and throws lavish parties every weekend.  There is cheating, there is a compelling love story, and there is (obviously) loads of sex, although they never actually \\"show\\" anything....while Toby MacQuire's character is sort of an \\"observer\\" of it all.  Eventually, he becomes friends with this mysterious Gatsby, and learns all his secrets.<br /><br />And, there is also....rap?  Rap in the 20's?  I remember thinking...whhhaaaaat????  This doesn't belong here!  I think the movie would have been much better if they had adhered to musical pieces from that time-frame...there are plenty of rioutous jazzy tunes to choose from, I'm sure.  It was the roaring 20's, after all.  The rap music was just weird...it didn't fit...and it sort of takes you out of the movie.  Why not stick to music of the times?  Why are we just catering to teens and people in their early 20's all the time?  Why not just do what's right for the movie?  Anyway, that was really my main problem with the movie, although I just convinced myself to \\"go with it.\\"<br /><br />Also, I wish there had been more character development.  Maybe the main character could have told us a little more about his feelings - even if that wasn't in the original story, they could have added it in.<br /><br />Other than these problems, I did enjoy the movie for what it's worth....this version of The Great Gatsby is unique, interesting, and \\"larger than life.\\"  Plus,like I said, it is definitely NOT boring!  There is a loose plot, so be patien, even if the movie seems a bit \\"plotless\\" at first.<br /><br />This movie is worth seeing, whether you've read the book or not.  I am glad we bought it, because I probably will watch it again.  The Great Gatsby is good for teens on up - not for really young children, of course.o with it.\\"<br /><br />Also, I wish there had been more character development.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey has been captivating since episode one of season one. Characters, set and scenery have been very appropriate for the era.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It creeps up on you and steals your soul.  I love this show so much.  I am very unhappy when the season ends.  It is impeccable in every way that counts as far as details and authenticity are concerned. The characters are so well developed by the actors portraying them.  I am not one to write reviews, but I envy anyone who has yet to see this.  It is so worth your time.  Even guys are surprised that they love it too.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I was hooked from the very first page of reading this book. This was the first time I read a book from a male's POV and it was absolutely hilarious. I was laughing so much that people on the bus probably thought I was crazy. I don't know where this guy comes up with the stuff he says but it is priceless.<br /><br />Drew Evans is a handsome and extremely confident guy. He gets women by just looking at them and of course his handsome smile. When Drew meets Katherine or Kate Brooks at his work, he first recognizes her by her butt (which is so wrong on so many levels, lol); he realizes that he might not be able to abide by his rule of keeping his workplace professional. Drew and Kate are extremely competitive, always trying to beat the other in work projects. After awhile, their attraction to one another grew undeniable.<br /><br />I really like the heroine of this story, Kate. She is smart, sassy, and extremely determined. She does not take crap from anyone especially Drew and puts him in his place if need be. She is in a man's world when it comes to her job and is very successful doing it.<br /><br />This book was a delight to read. It is the kind of book where you can't really read to many reviews, you just have to dive in. It is a feel good book. I honestly could not stop thinking about the book days after I finished. Even now, I want to read it again. The author did an excellent job portraying a man in her writing. I was so excited to learn that there will be 2 more books coming out in the series. Twisted, which is the second book coming out in March 2014 and Tamed, out May 2014.<br /><br />To view more reviews please visit us at: www.thebabblingreader.blogspot.ca
B0042TV4IW|4.0|It's nice enough to watch while I am waiting for Downton Abbey's new season to return.  I just love all of the zainey characters.
B005721W9O|5.0|I love this movie.  The characters are all spot on.  Any fan of the original Star Trek will fall out of their chair laughing.
B001HC8516|5.0|Really eye-opening.  Made me stop and think about a guy I was interested in.  Wondered why he never asked me out. Now I know he's just not that into me!  Great book.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one of the smartest shows ever created.  We need a revival of this show, even with a new cast.  This is just a create TV show.
B00CEQ1JOO|1.0|It was given as a gift so I cannot truly rate it but for me personally it is awful and makes no sense but that goes for so many things now
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lolts of fun and addicting<br /><br />Could not put it down I like all th,e cool upgrades. The puzzles are ni ce tmoo
B009ZQJ1G4|3.0|The premise of the movie strains the suspension of disbelief to the breaking point.  Even if you are fan of Christian Bale and a Matrix-inspired fight scene you can't enjoy them. Little men inside your head will continuously inject &#34;This doesn't make sense&#34;  over the dialogue and soundtrack.<br /><br />It gets 3 instead of 2 because the acting is decent, the plot is at least initially intriguing to see where it goes, and by the time you realize that none of this makes sense, the movie is half over.
0312330537|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Being an Indian myself, I could relate to the story a lot.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I had seen seasons two and three, but totally missed season one, so this helped 'catch me up' to the anticipated season 4.  The production was excellent, a number of questions as to 'what happened' were answered, and I thoroughly enjoyed these DVDs.
B00821OX98|4.0|But at the end of the season it starts picking up. Season 2 looks to be faster and better. Definitely worth watching.
B0000028M7|5.0|I love Dirt. It is very creative and rocks hard.The songs all seem to do with death.Just look at the lyrics and all the songs on Dirt,and you will agree with me.The guitars are played very nicely by Cantrell and Staley,and the drums are also amazing if you like good drumming in your music.Anyway,this album rocks and you really have to get it very soon or you might die.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  Not what I expected.  I would recommend.
B0029LHW4U|5.0|Black Gives Way to Blue is a very nice comeback album for Alice in Chains.It really sounds like their old stuff in a lot of ways.The guitars are still as good and the vocals sung by Jerry Cantrell are just as good as Staleys.i really recommend this album to anyone.They are the only grunge band that really managed to keep their grunge sound after all these years.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|The most relaxing app I ever had and I sleep sound every night!!!  Without it I don't sleep through the night. Thank you!!!
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here is a great album for Alice in Chains.Plus,it sounds just as good as their older stuff,maybe even better!Lane Staley will be missed,but Jerry Cantrell has taken his place very well.The guitars on this album are very good and the bass is also good.The drums are more polished than on the old Alice in Chains albums,but that isn't bad at all!Alice in Chains has managed to continue Staleys dream and they still can rock just as good as they used to in the nineties.My favorite songs are Hollow,Pretty Done,and Stone.
6305922756|1.0|The case was broken, and the disc was unreadable by a dv player. Just ridiculous that I pay for something that does not even work.
B00000272N|5.0|What can I really say about this cd?Alot! All the songs are catchy and the guitars,which are played by Jerry Cantrell and Lane Staley, are amazing.The drums in Facelift are very loud and are played very well. I really enjoy this cd throughout and you can really sing along and jam to Alice in Chains.Alice in Chains truly is the best grunge band I have ever heard.
B002XTXFU8|5.0|To any one who's thinking about picking this up to see a gritty drama about a hardened criminal, pause; This movie is &#34;gritty&#34;, but it's<br />more of a sadistic comedy told from the warped mind of an insane prisoner. It's very interesting, but you have to have a kind of twisted side to appreciate the mentality of the narrative mind-set. Be cautious.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it....best game of alll time ...i play this game alll day everyday . so addictive . love it love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing and suspenseful I can't say anything else about it so to bad for the 20 word limit
B00D23GXB2|5.0|You know at first I thought this was going to be a plain book about sex and orgasms written by a man. What I read was so much more. Sexually charged and playful stories written with enchanting metaphors and  pure poetic touch. His alliteration was great as well.<br /><br />Hats off and plenty of snaps to you G.P.A.
140006922X|3.0|When will the movie come out? Reza Aslan's Zealot has provoked a tangled web of media attention and conversation. Unfortunately, much of this has been focused on the now famous - or infamous - Fox News interview and on Aslan as a person, a Muslim, an academic. This is not surprising given both the theatrical style of much of the book - we can see the movie scenes already - controversies surrounding Fox News.    But what about the context and credibility of the book itself?  My own blog will focus on Jesus and Jesus and 1st century Palestine. Therefore I want to comment therefore on what Aslan actually says about Jesus of Nazareth, how he arrives at his conclusions and what I think about them. Bottom line? My position is:  *A Muslim can write a book about Jesus of course, and Aslan claims a strong interest in Jesus dating back to a childhood experience. Enough said.  *Placing Jesus within the context of the world in which he lived is very valuable. I myself have been studying and writing about 1st c. Palestine for years.  *Coming to a conclusion about the \\"historical Jesus\\" has been attempted by many and cannot be done. Aslan says this himself, although he then proceeds to do just that.  *I do not believe Jesus was a Zealot and shall explain why - very briefly.    We all come from somewhere and Jesus was a Jew living in 1st century Palestine - where the land and the temple were ruled by the Roman Empire and most of the people were trapped in poverty. Those who saw and heard him and those later responsible for the Gospels were also from this world. Understanding the political, religious, socio-economic realities adds enormously to our reading and understanding of the New Testament. Village scenes, parables, the Sermon on the Mount all come alive in new ways.    And it is very important to know that Jesus was crucified for crimes against the Roman Empire. Romans reserved crucifixion for those convicted of sedition. It is also true that he spoke about a very different kingdom where the first would be last and the last would be first. And Jesus definitely had a pivotal confrontation with both the Roman Empire and the priests they appointed when he entered the temple, drove out the money changers and called it a den of thieves. From that moment his fate was sealed. All of these things and many more make it clear that he opposed oppression, arrogance, greed and lording it over others.    But none of this means he was a revolutionary bent on violent overthrow of the Empire. Aslan's claim is that the church made a peaceful, soft Jesus for political expediency.  His argument that the church had reason to avoid a portrayal that would get them in big trouble is interesting. It bears thinking about. I can agree that the Christian church as generally preached a \\"nice\\" Jesus, avoiding Gospel passages that disturb this image.    But it seems Aslan greatly overreaches with his claims that Jesus was a revolutionary bent on ousting the Roman Empire and becoming king through \\"zeal\\" and the sword.  In fact that would make him king of another empire founded, once again, on power and violence.    Jesus is complex and so are the gospels. We try to know him and about him; we ought to beware of claiming to contain him in a particular image, because that is sure to be our own image.    My blog will place Jesus within 1st century Palestine where Rome ruled, Jews were often bitterly divided about how to survive under Rome, and most of the people were poor and oppressed. I will invite readers to ponder Jesus' very complexity. Indeed, he seems to love everyone and to take \\"pot shots\\" at everyone: priests, pharisees, essenes, zealots, villagers, the disciples themselves. This blog is written for all who are interested in wrestling with Jesus' question: \\"Who do you say that I am?\\"
B005GY0Y8S|4.0|I definitely want to read more of this story.  It just got better and better as you got more drawn into the mystery. I'm ready for more.
B000063JZQ|5.0|I loved Jon Finch as Henry IV in the BBC Shakespeare stuff.  He was did a stellar job as MacB in this one.
0871164566|5.0|this was a great book, well laid out and great pictures as well. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to take their metal work to another level
B0035HKWM6|4.0|This was made when Jim Carrey was at his best! Crazy funny. My first copy got scratched and I just had to get another.
B0090SI582|1.0|Then you're probably like me in that you hated this pathetic farce of a movie. This movie had no redeeming features other than a slightly interesting Yukio. I waited for this film to really get started but it bored and annoyed me at almost every turn.<br />Also, the Silver Samurai as a giant adamantium robot was horrid. I have never been more angry at wasting my money on a film.
B009GX6TMA|5.0|We love the show. Zooey and Hannah are great. Honey watches it because of the guys. Also love Mindy Project.
B008MWBY6W|3.0|It works as described.  Not a lot of room for a second lens.  T3 with 200mm lens attached leaves room for 50mm with snug fit.  I'm not sure what to use the side pockets for...they are small.  You could probably fit an extra battery on the front pocket.
B00D3LA71K|4.0|One of Matthew McConaughey's best efforts in a long time.  It was good to see him in a story with some grit (no pun intended) to it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series of one of the best ones I've seen in years.  I cannot wait until Season 4 starts on PBS
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|Pretty cool app. It comes in handy to make quick notes. I liked how it turned my handwritten notes with my stylus, and could convert them into typewritten.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Ryan fights aliens.  You know what you are getting into beforehand, and it gets you there, but I doubt there will be a sequel to this one...
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I place this at the foot of my bed. Great motion detector/warning system before someone jumps into my bed and surprises me! (or potential intruders, knock-on-wood)<br /><br />PROS:  Very bright. Great for bathrooms or dark hallways.<br />CONS:  I wish the light stayed a little longer
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Really great CD to chill out to.  Unique sound that is fun.  Really  love her voice and her style.  A must own for music lovers.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|Obviously, there is a lot of love for this film, and that is great. However, I do not think that Peter Jackson and the other producers deserve any real pats on the back for this one. It is a steep, steep step down from the Lord of the Rings, and more to the point, not nearly as good as it could have/should have been on its own terms. But I will concede that it is fine as lively, varied adventure film, entertainment value if you will. So there is that.<br /><br />The good points include most of the casting, the expectedly rich set and costume design, and the pitch-perfect portrayal of Bilbo's encounter with Gollum, which is easily the best scene in the film. There are some nice moments of humor, some reassuring familiar faces, and a few glimpses of some of the Hobbit-specific elements that will be the focus of the next film. And I have to mention how much I love the low, moody song that the dwarves sing about going to the Misty Mountains. A wondrous bit of character music, there.<br /><br />On the other hand, the fact that the producers are misguidedly trying to use the Hobbit (a relatively short, unpretentious adventure tale) as a host-body for another epic LOTR-style trilogy is painfully, awkwardly evident all over this film. The pacing at the beginning is ridiculous. It is obviously dragging on simply to fill a running-time quota (and not a brief running time). So much for the artistic merit of stretching the Hobbit across three films. There are many added-in characters and plot elements. Some of them may be sourced from Tolkien's other writings, and thus technically canon, but in almost no case here to they really make the story any better, if indeed they do not make it worse. Finally, there are the visual effects. They seem much more cartoonish and CGI-centric than what I recall from Peter Jackson's previous films. Which is to say, cheaper. Some of the humor is also far cheaper than it has any business to be in a Tolkien film. But I could just go on...<br /><br/>Ultimately, to me it is very painfully clear that financial ambitions gained the upper hand over artistic integrity. There is nothing wrong with enjoying this film of course, but it represents a sad regression from the exceptionally high level of craftsmanship and fidelity that governed the LOTR films. One might argue that the Hobbit should not be compared to LOTR, and I agree. The problem here is that the filmmakers missed that memo themselves, thus this film is not really trying to be the Hobbit so much as another Fellowship of the Ring. Which it is not. The result of that identity crisis is that, in my opinion, this is a mediocre-to-decent film at best.
B000I186FW|5.0|First, wonderful cast, writing, dialog. I've watched this DVD many times over.<br /><br />Secondly, I'm also reminded by movies like this what can happen to a population that lets their government gets out of control.
B00CO8D3G4|3.0|I am still reading this book and I have to say, it's interesting and different.<br /><br />Hopefully I will keep reading and learning.<br />It's written pretty well, but I am not so sure it ''fits'' with who I am.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|FREAK SOMEBODY WHY WONT YOU  OUT OF THIS WORLD YOU KNOW TRUE STUFF MANO WACHALE EH NOW ITS REALLY REAL
B007MDB71O|5.0|Excellent movie would love to have a sequel great cast and fx effects Disney should have done a better promotion job all this film and the CEO who bagged on it to stock holders should have been FIRED!
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|I enjoyed the book up to where shots are fired and the next chapter jumps to what is happening with Amanda and her family. I kept hoping to be surprised by the out come of the book. I wasn't!  Frankly I was afraid to ever read a Nicholas Sparks book after seeing A Walk To Remember (which I liked very much) and A Message In A Bottle. I thought that maybe a main character died in all the books. I have been delighted that is hasn't been true in all the others I've read. Will I read more of his books? Probably, he writes well and is one of my favorite writers. I just hope he doesn't use this kind of cheap trick again.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|quick game. able to complete all in a short peroid of time. would recommend to anyone in search of a little challenge but not a lot of time
B00A6C3JN2|4.0|Was looking for a micro-controller to get started on some projects I been wanting to do. I got the Due as opposed to the Uno because I am a undergrad engineering student and wanted to be as up to date as possible. And who knows maybe in the future I might need the extra processing power or pins.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is addicting for sure.  Mindless fun for as long as you can keep your credits.  Great for bedtime relaxing.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I loved this book.  It was very honest and forthright.  It made me have an even deeper appreciation and respect for Dave Mustaine.  \m/ \m/
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We just finished season 3 and are dismayed that we have to wait 4 more months to see what happens next! Guess we'll watch silly stuff for awhile.
B0009X7664|5.0|My granddaughter had to read the book for Honors English and I remembered how much I loved the movie and how certain parts of the movie has stayed with me throughout all the years. I read the book with her and thought she, too, would enjoy seeing the book come alive. It was  and is a great book and a great movie. Hopefully others will take time to read or watch some of these classics. I must admit, I hope there is not a &#34;remake&#34; of this movie, I don't see how it could possibly be done any better. Watch and enjoy, even better, read the book and watch the movie.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Beautiful graphics and extremely easy to set up &amp; use. Nice!!! Has everything I need with a simple glance. Very professional looking.
B005XUC398|3.0|It was an ok movie. Lots of twists n turns so pay attention.  Worth the watch time I guess, just not my kind of flick.
B003ITIQ88|5.0|Great animal movie! Very sweet and a little funny too. Its not what you expect which makes it good. Its a family movie
B007R108WA|3.0|Certainly a b rated kind of flick.  Gory in a mild kind of way in comparison to some movies in today's choices.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I have played UNO for years with my family as a card game.  This is a good game which I enjoy.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Has become one of my classics when I want a quality love story.  Have watched this one a number of times.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Book is great, and you really get into the characters.  Liked the back and forth story telling of main characters, but HATED the ending.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Bought this app after using the free version for a month. Love the display and by searching the menus, there are loads of information. What more could you want?
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I rented this for my grandsons and watched it with them.  It is a cute movie with a very nice message.  I enjoyed it so much it was easy to watch a second time with my grand nephews who visited me at the beach!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a fabulous series, and I hope it has many more seasons ahead. The characters and the time period come alive, and as a historian, the period is accurately portrayed. Bravo! once again Masterpiece Theater.
B004X75RK4|5.0|Cute, funny and easy to watch anytime you meed a movie to just zone out to.  I love both Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds in this movie.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Couldn't put it down, read all the way through. Would definitely recommend this book. Working on the last book of the series now. Cant wait for the next one.
B0040HO01Y|4.0|Love it! I'm watching the fourth season now and will miss Dorcas Lane's wisdom and good nature once I'm done. Thanks amazon prime.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it.  Its challenging, frustrating and lots of fun. Its a game and a puzzle.  Its more for adults or older kids.  Nice to have a game that makes you think.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is my first hidden object game. I was surprised at the amount of recorded dialog that was relatively well done. The plot is decent though clich&eacute;.  A wide variety of mini games And overall a good game.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I'm so sick of this couple. The first book should have been a stand-alone.  Three is way too many books to waste on this sludge.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|You Tube didn't work for me over the Internet. I downloaded this and I could watch You Tube. What more can I ask?
B008X8RSTM|2.0|Paid for this app because the reviews were half decent.  However, after trying to use this app for several days it was a bust.  Loading the map itself was very slow, loading  section by section.  Kept freezing while in the process of trying to find other states and cities; could not find the settings to put the information in.  Thought it would be of some help in visiting other cities in the state I was in but ,nope, no help what so ever.  Tried with the WiFi on and that did not help.  Was using this on my Kindle Fire HD, don't know what the problem is but I wouldn't recommend this to a seeing-eye-dog.  Wasted my funds on this app, will stick to in car GPS.  Giving 2 stars and that's being generous.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I like the because it is about sharks and I am a huge fan of sharks. But there are some things I did not like. Like this I get hurt from going to deep in the sea and the hammer head sharks kill you in one hit. So I liked the game but did not love it
B009GJBBDQ|5.0|Lots of action, not very believable, but then again that's not why you watch Bond.  Would recommend to anyone anytime.
159463176X|4.0|A good story well written.  Sometimes a little awkward following the characters between past and present but still very enjoyable.
B00BNPI7VU|5.0|Awesome book. It reminded me of when we rescued a kitten and brought it home to meet our other cat. Great book and I will be buying another of the series.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Hopefully you saw the original Stallone &#34;Dredd&#34; movie.  That movie was about the Dredd character, full of Stallone-esque action and drama (I liked it).  This movie is about the story and has a lot more action, significantly more action, and almost &#34;Saw&#34; levels of violence and grotesqueness.  Like the original, you don't watch it to see if anyone will win an Oscar, but it is not full of bad acting.  This version follows the story of the original but with more emphasis on society's situation and it will entertain you if you want A LOT of action.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This is definitely  a movie for adults or older teens. the plot is very good and am looking forward to the 3rd season.  I so want that evil little king dead. Very moving and thought provoking.  No boring here
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|First, I'd like to say that I do like this film, and have seen it several times. It's very entertaining, and certainly colorful, with fine performances and wonderful sets, but it just isn't a great film, and I can't give it more than three stars. I'm not sure this version of \\"Gatsby\\" would be recognized by its original creator. After the first 15 minutes or so I began to wonder if Fitzgerald's story had been rewritten by a graphic-novelist. The film seems cartoonish, somehow, and I couldn't quite believe in Gatsby or Daisy; they just seem too round-faced and, (despite DiCaprio's wrinkles), young.<br /><br />  Who on earth would ever imagine Gatsby as DiCaprio? There's absolutely nothing mysterious about him. His performance was identical to all of his performances; I don't think he's capable of being anyone but Leo. His accent is bizarre, definitely not Midwestern, or New York, or Oxford. Exactly what was he shooting for? Carey Mulligan may be cute, but it's very hard for me to picture anyone, even DiCaprio, investing so much effort towards winning her heart. They both look about 15 years old, they'll probably still look like teenagers when they're 60. And what's up with casting Spiderman as Gatsby's minion? Unfair, I admit, McQuire's a decent actor, but the Spidey image is not easily shed.<br /><br />  As for the soundtrack, there are so many problems with it that I don't even know where to start, but the first thing that comes to mind is the Rap music. Others may disagree, but when I watch a movie set in the 1920s, with costumes that are vaguely reminiscent of the era, and the word \\"jazz\\" is flung around from time to time, I don't want to hear anything that sounds like Rap.  There's virtually no jazz, although there are some songs that sound like they might be popular music from that era; lyrical songs, of course. All those lyrics are very distracting. Songs with lyrics are used to accompany strongly emotional scenes, something that's generally not done in movies aimed at an adult audience. The soundtrack doesn't support the story, instead, it seems to be jumping up and down screaming for attention.<br /><br />  Come to think of it, each element of the film, the music, the costumes, the sets, the clever dialogue, tries too hard to be noticed.  There's no sense of restraint, and it doesn't add up to an integrated whole. All of the glittering facets may catch your eye, (and your ear), but they don't capture your heart. That's unfortunate, because, in my opinion, the film's makers have totally missed the point. Somewhere in the middle of all the flashy sets, the pumping music and the special effects,  the story got lost.aimed at an adult audience.

B00003CXTG|4.0|Pearl Harbor is one of my favorite movies.  I enjoyed it when it came out on the big screen.  Then again, on VHS.  I have seen it a number of times over the years.  I decided to get it on DVD because the last time I watched it on VHS, it acted up , so thought it was time to retire it.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|An interesting variety of short stories about many successful people's lives from which young people, who are serious about being great, can gain insight and purpose.<br /><br />The book presented me with thoughtful examples of why only certain people are successful and perhaps guidelines for developing FUTURE LEADERS.<br /><br />I compare this work to that of Temple Grandin and &#34;Thinking in Pictures&#34; as well as her many follow up works. tI also brings top mind the 3 books by Dave Pelzer. His &#34; A child Called IT&#34; and his &#34;A Man Named Dave&#34;. Stories of HOPE, a Will to succeed and Success.
1590171993|5.0|A friend of mine in the UK e-mailed me that Ian McEwan had been on BBC radio talking about this novel from 1965,which seemed to have gone unnoticed,and he made it seem that this was the most remarkable novel of our age. My friend was anxious to receive his copy from Amazon UK and encouraged me to experience it for myself.<br />Stoner is a painfully beautiful novel full of the sadness and resilience of the human condition. It is nakedly honest and told with breathtakingly lovely, poetic language. A man's seemingly unproductive journey creating a life of minute dedication and suppressed emotions unfolds with sensitivity and understanding. As you read, you live with & experience these characters.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and felt greatly for the characters. I grew attached to them and hoped for their success and well being.
B008B68J2G|5.0|So all those little monster high dolls have to have something to play with. A perfect Christmas present for my oldest granddaughter. These are difficult to find in the stores and you sure cant beat having them delivered to your door! The price was competitive to other places but with the Amazon Derrick and guarantees. An excellent choice.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|I love bubble pop games.  This is on  of the better free ones. I wish there were more ways to get power ups. Other than that it is a great game.
B008B68IUY|5.0|This is a Christmas present for my granddaughter. It is difficult to find in the stores. The monster high things on Amazon are priced the same as the retail stores.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love this game.  I loved the original on  too. I just wish I could find friends that play so I can get help with supplies.  Other than that I love the game.
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas present for my youngest granddaughter. It came only 3 days after I ordered it. Just as described. Same price as in the stores.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I am finding this game challenging enough to hold my interest, frustrating enough that I have caught myself shouting \\"Arghhh\\" right out loud, and overall, just plain fun.  Another Bonus - I think I will be able to play it for a good long time due to multiple levels and challenges!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Not as good of a book as enders game but still a great story line. Kept me on the edge but I like action which enders game gave me. Working on xenozide or however you spell it. Seems to be great so far. no action but good story.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Applause has me beyond excited to see what Gaga has next for us!!!!! I can't wait for ARTPOP! I love the music video also! Everyone should buy this and watch the video [...]
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was a great read , one that I thought I could predict the end of, but I was so wrong! Loved every moment of it. !
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My 6 year old grand daughter loves this movie.  It was a good value and was shipped quickly.  Bonus discs were included.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The events described can be presented quite briefly and have been done so on TV a number of times.  None the less, the extra detail is good to have.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Makes reading fun again as I have aged my eyes are not what the used to be, now I can read without straining and getting headaches<br /><br />I highly recommend getting the google app that allows you to send web pages to your kindle
B00819ER0Q|5.0|An amazing film that follows one mans life as he knows it, as it starts to unravel he begins to see his whole world is a facade.  It speaks volumes on our individual perception of a life we lay out for ourselves or one that is already in motion. It's beautifully shot and has a fantastic score by Philip Glass.
B00640UICA|5.0|I like that there are new characters added with different abilities as you progress through the levels. This game is also fun for adults.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|The story was fun, funny, exciting and a little sad and I can't wait to pick up the next book in the series!
B0013UIUBC|5.0|Just the type of movie to brighten up your day. I first saw it on Netflix and enjoyed it so much I ordered it from Amazon.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Fits great in my wallet.  Holds as many cards (SD and micro SD and an adapter) as I am likely to ever need for extended shooting.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Had this some years ago, but someone borrowed it and it never came back to me. Totally surprising ending and a host of great actors.
B004G600A4|3.0|There was a small scratch on the DVD which does effect playback.  Would have been nice to know before I bought it.  But we were able to clean the disk and it seems to be fine now.
B009WUBERW|5.0|This is a good movie to watch.  Sylvester Stallone plays a good part and the entire movie held my attention.  Recommend watching it.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|sex is too s&M.  for adults only!!  Story line is very good.  I was uncomfortable reading this book because of the control and pain involved.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am enjoying this game a lot. The levels are somewhat challenging, but not too hard. It's free so not loss if you do not like it.
B00DH1G7DS|4.0|I like sudoku on paper, but this was even more fun ....and you can change a number without having to find an eraser.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|it's a platform game  you need to move fast, and think fast. Lots of jumping and finding hidden diamonds. I like it
B006M4F67A|4.0|Just a fun game that makes you think a little...  usually I don't like computer games, but this one really fun
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Personally I loved the book. It's a classic love story but with plenty of twists and turns to keep the reader interested. I would highly recommend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this show. The interesting characters, juicy plot, beautiful scenery, fabulous costumes, and historical context all add up to make this wonderful television.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|The best way to fall asleep ever. With tons of sounds and more that you can download ehite noise is the best sleep remedy ever. Every night I sleep better with white noise and all the comforting sounds it has.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|One of my all time favorites. With complex charecters and plenty of drama, it is one of the most sophisticated shows on tv today. I highly recommend it to anyone,  but especially those who liked Boston Legal.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This is an extremely well-written, vivid and compelling story with all the intrigue needed to make you want to keep reading long into the night.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|The game is very short.  Updates are not frequent.  Levels are great though with just the right amount of difficulty.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I like this game a lot, but some of the initial challenges are much too difficult to overcome, so I remain locked out of a lot of the gameplay.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I started watching Doctor Who last year and I must admit the 9th Doctor took a little getting used to because he wasn't what I expected. Like EVERYONE I grew to love the 10th Doctor, so I was worried when it was Matt Smith's turn. He instantly proved me foolish for being worried and is now probably my favorite.<br /><br />The shows are good too :)
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Terrific play-by-play for formatting a book for Kindle. It doesn't waste words, just tells you what to do and how to do it in simple, non-nonsense terms. After you've gone through the &#34;near-birth&#34; process of writing a book, it's a relief to find a formatting &#34;Bible&#34; to help you deliver your book to the public. I keep it close at hand.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Somehow I've avoided or not watched this show until recently, despite the many good things I have heard. My fear of the show being cheesy was quelled about halfway through the first season where things really pick up. Can't wait to watch more.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I enjoy this game but it freezes my Kindle up much too often!  Although one can work within the coin system without a cash purchase, it is still annoying.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|From the moment I began reading this book I had a hard time putting it down. I kept wanting to know what happens to Clarissa and Jase. Does Alex die. What about Clarissa's mom? Now I have to get the next book.
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Gossip girl infects your life! Even after the show has ended I find myself thinking about it. The last season is amazing I just had to buy it if only for just the chuck and Blair scenes, its just so good
B000OVLINI|4.0|Very good book. Started off slow but I couldn't put the second half down. A good read. A story within a story which made it fun and interesting.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|I have no rating for the Mini Golf - I never got into it!<br />Keeps taking me to a Facebook sign in page !
B009WUBERW|1.0|How bad can an action film be when it is full of action stars?  It can be very, very bad...please don't make any more!
B00640UICA|5.0|I  got this game for free, but if I had known just how good it was, I would gladly have paid for it. It's very easy to get the hang of, but oh so difficult to beat. I hope they come out with a sequel or maybe an expansion.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great special effects and the actors have fun with their roles.  It is a fun movie that you can watch more then once and still see some things you didn't notice the first few times.
B00C1S945G|5.0|Can always expect an intriguing story here. Love it. I have always been a fan and am thrilled that the blonde that died in season one is no longer with the show!!!
B00B7ERH04|5.0|I agree with the reviews I read,out of all the cameras I tried with the Kindle HD<br />this is ONE of the best!Very good quality both in photos and videos.plus it's free<br />can go wrong with that.I highly recommend
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|I love it because it makes you think and use your brain to sort things out. And it's not impossible to understand :)
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Unbelievable  --  every minute is great.  Not just a great Ozzie album but one of the best album that ive ever heard.
B00A44HRG2|1.0|Cool idea. But very few cameras in the states. And hard to search for what u actually want to look at
B000FC12SM|5.0|Melt all your resentments away... It will really clear the air between you and you partner. My favorite quote, &#34;we speak different languages but use the same words&#34;.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is very impressive it's about 1 gig of memory and completely worth every bit you can customize and upgrade weapons and armour and there is also PvP in the game. There is a problem I have. After I beat the game and was about to go do the elite version it kept crashing I don't think it's the kindle because it never crashed until this point if you could find the problem I will thank you. Besides that this game is the bet game you could ever wish to have
B00AB7HESI|1.0|The notepad won't let me create anything, it wont let me delete certain objects, and I hate the fact that you have to buy costumes with real money same with levels.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have had the pleasure of enjoying all three seasons of Downton Abbey.  This makes a wonderful gift for someone or just enjoy it yourself.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|THIS APP I  TH  BEST. It copies what you say and does  some experiments It also a funny app because I  you talk in a different language it still speaks This is a cool APP!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Seasons 1 and 2 are great ...good entertainment.  These have filled my evenings with good thoughts and not all the bad things that are going on in this world.
B003F44QRQ|5.0|This movie is fun and wonderfully 80's.  It makes me feel like a pre-teen again watching &#34;the Corys&#34; act together.
B00589BMF0|4.0|Stands the test of time, one of my top two sci-fi horror favorites. Would be better and get the 5 stars if it were the director's cut.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love my Chromecast device. Works great with Netflix (crystal clear picture) and Youtube. Connects really fast and offers a very easy to use interface. I downloaded the app in my phone and run it with out a problem every single time. The only thing that worries me is that it overheats so I don't know if that's going to be an issue in the future.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|Very happy with cd vince did a very good job covering  Buck and Hag thats all I can say a
B008XG1X18|5.0|Blackstone Chronicles is not new and this is not the first time I have read it, but am enjoying it again all the same.
B009KYXEY6|1.0|My low rating is not about Lana del Rey, it is about this purchase. I never got to hear the disc.<br /><br />The package arrived late, broken and one disc was missing. I read there had been issues where there were missing songs, but with me its was a hole disc. What I got was a disc with only four songs. Luckily the Amazon Customer Service is amazing and I got my money back.<br /><br />If you want this I suggest you buy it from another seller or find it in a record store
B0049GYXDQ|5.0|I got my movie in 2 days I was so impressed! It came in perfect condition and even a bonus music disc.
193700788X|2.0|The whole story line was completely thrown off the plot made no sense and past characters were just thrown into the story line. The ending was crappy I am just so disappointed that this was the last book and it was so poorly written
193700788X|5.0|This is a great end to a wonderful series. I have been enthralled by these books for some time now & hate to see it end.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like this book pretty well.  Had to read it since I had read the first 2.  I wasn't as happy with this one, though, as I was with the first two.  There will be another one out to continue the story.  I had thought it was just going to be a trilogy, but apparently not.  I mean, the story was ok and all, but the first two books were much better.  I'm hoping the next one is better than this one.  I'll have to read it, though, so I can find out what happens.  :-)
B002VECM6S|4.0|The acting was great and the story awesome--there were times it seemed too good to be true, but the story is real and truly did happen and the credibility is well portrayed in this movie!  The &#34;too-good-to-be-true&#34; occurred to me only because in this story someone did care enough to love this wonderful young man!  It is very inspiring to be willing to let Christ love ALL other people through me in the same way this gal was willing to do!  And her husband and family were so marvelously influenced by her commitment and faith in doing so!  Great movie!  AND TRUE!
B00E1LAS42|5.0|Great movie for guys and girls alike! Date night or solo, this film was a good experience! I could certainly watch it multiple times
B004TI5N38|5.0|Enjoyed this thoroughly. Will go back and read his other books.  My attention span is nil so this says a lot.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|Great movie about the struggles of a time in history. Showing the hardships of war and how it affects the troops fighting for freedom.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I wanted a bigger clock on my kindle and this is perfect! Love the alarm when travelling and for appointments.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Nice season to keep ones interest.  What a great way to complete a Saturday than with back to back good UK television!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I absolutely adored this book.  I loved the way JoJo Moyes invited you into the lives of her characters.  You felt their heartache and shared their joy.  It is beautifully written by a masterful storyteller.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season is full of surprises and lots of unfolding's.  Cannot wait to catch up on season 4!  On the end of my seat!
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I love this charger so far.  It fits very snugly into the outlet and feels really SOLID.  It's super convenient when we have two phones to charge.  I will purchase another one for our other car.
B00190KZUU|3.0|This is a film about resolving issues between father and son.  Great analogies and symbolism.  I would have liked to see more character development with the mother, played by the lovely Jessica Lange.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I think the story is amazing and very worthwhile reading....the ending was a little different than I was expecting but totally worth reading the book for.
B006LXQID8|5.0|I loved this quirky comedy.  It has odd people, which are always the most interesting.  My grandmother always said &#34;there is a cover for every pot&#34; and I am glad her character found hers!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie arrived in great shape and as promised. No damage and Blue ray plays great! I have watched it about ten times already!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|Superb animation and direction. Good attempt for the first round of this classic. Looking forward to viewing future adventures Tintin.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this sequel to Fall of Giants and didn't want it to end.  Best book I've read in a long time.  Can't wait for the third book in this trilogy.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is really awesome headset. Everything is perfect. Specially playing games and watching movies. You really get nice experience. I am glad I purchase this
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|1st Dredd with Stalone was not good, this one is a bunch of violent action sequences. It reminds me of other martial arts movies where the protagonist must escape a building by eliminating everyone. I was bored when I picked this movie and remained so.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|this game was fun and then it started getting boring. because the breeding dragons took a long time so all i started to do is plant food and thats it.it got boring.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Yes totally enjoyed and looking forward to season 4...When might it be coming out....So looking forward to<br />watching it.  to see what happens...
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a wonderful read that takes some time because of the experiments.  They are very entertaining and enlightening!  I was very pleasantly amazed at the results I received from opening myself up to FP and the infinite intelligence of the Universe!
B0000062Y2|5.0|The music sounds really good coming off of the cd.  I can't stop humming those tunes  because they are so uplifting.
B008TRH5N6|5.0|Loved everything about it.  Be sure and purchase the original edition and not one of the later ones that has been edited.  Taught me a lot about my subconscious and how much it affects everything I say, do, believe, think and am.
B003M70O5O|4.0|Action packed and full of intrigue. I don't like all the porn. Without the porn I would have given it five stars.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game really challenges my brains....I love it!!!<br />Can't wait to get updates! I recommend this game to anyone looking for something different and fun.<br />Gotta try it!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Fey offers both mocking and sincere advice and opinions on a range of topics. I literally LOL'ed throughout the entire book, sometimes to the point where I was forced to stop reading. Fey is able to convey herself with honesty and dignity. I would certainly never call her Bossypants.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was a perfect &#34;starter&#34; for someone who's never really read anything supernatural beyond the likes of the Twilight series. The story was always moving, never any dragging parts, but didn't get too busy and confusing like some complicated plots can. It always left me anxious to know more, and I got very little sleep in the 2-3 days it took me to read it.<br />Among my other many reasons for liking it so much, I especially loved her ability to provide such creative imagery. She could draw a vivid comparison between one object or feeling to another so unrelated that I would have never put them in the same sentence together - and it always fit well. It was impressive. I had one major dislike but can't complain about it without spoiling anything, so I will not. While it was sort of a large one, it was also my only complaint about the book. So..4.5 stars from me (I rounded up.)
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I like the game but I don't like to have to start at the beginning every time so I don't like the game after 5 min
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Amazing read, couldn't put the book down once I started. I got caught up in the magic and read it through my beach vacation
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love all of his books.  I especially liked the individual stories of the characters and how he weaved them together.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Love the characters and the story line. Happy I took the advice of friends and decided to watch old episodes using my Prime Membership.  :-)
B00BC24NT4|2.0|I have tried to get beyond the first 10 pages and don't find it easy to follow, so I gave up.
B002JVWR4U|4.0|loved how 2nd season brought in power of mind to overcome man's brainwashing technology within lives of dolls. enjoyed linking of each episode to others.  disliked overarching backstory--seriously? (don't want to give spoiler, but ....really? that is why &#34;Echo&#34; is so special??)  Epilogue was pretty cool, though.  Nice job of resolving all character's issues--including moral quandries. Tough to say more without spoilers.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Very thin on plot.  Mildly entertaining.  Not sure who the target audience is as it is too simple for adults and too scary for children.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This album is dark and deep but still beautiful. The songs are meaningful and really get you thinking. Each song makes you really think, with the elegance (per say) of Gerard Way's voice. I can listen to this album without skipping a single song, which is rare for me. I totally recommend for rainy days or actually any day.
B000HF6XPY|4.0|It is an awesome movie. It was a favorite as a kid and still is now 20 years later. Arnold Schwarzenegger is basically Conan in this movie
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is one of my favorite My Chemical Romance albums. The songs are electric, and the story told is enthralling. Gerard's singing is top-notch as always with especially brilliant baselines (see: Save Yourself, I'll Hold Them Back). I didn't think I would like Danger Days at first, with the more electronic song. But MCR did not disappoint, and I'll be listening to this CD for as long as I can.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I found this easy to play with and compose my own tunes; however the play time is short enough that the tunes get a little repetitive. I think, if I purchased the upgraded one, it might be better. Still fun to have on hand--especially when travelling on long flights.
B0002858YS|5.0|The songs get stuck in your head, and you'll love every minute. Classic Killers sound with a twist! A little more drag and punk than the other albums, but soso good!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved the way this story was narrated, with the tapes. It was simply, heartbreakingly beautiful. It was so just, I loved the ending. I loved all of it. Although nothing is worth taking your own life, this girl had it hard. And she was alone. You need to read it.
B008I3QZKU|5.0|This album has a steady beat throughout that makes working out a blast! High quality all around-- really gets you pumped up!
B004Q3UL2O|3.0|Too much nudity and sex for me. I like romance but to me, this movie was too slutty. I would recommend it to people who don't mind all that skin.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|When I got all the CDs by the Killers, I thought this would be my least favorite. But the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love. The songs are captivating with a slightly spooky edge like in Tranquilize or Shadowplay. Definitely give it a few listens!!
B00C28J2VQ|5.0|love the series so far... loads of action.....cannt wait for the next one to come out... I recommend this for the action movie lover
B000GY729M|5.0|Sam's Town has clever lyrics and a fun sound. Definitely a keeper, for rocking out on long summer days in the car.
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|Game has a bug on lvl 3-1 creators are not going to fix. Don't waste your time downloading. Contacted devs said they were not going to fix because kindle was a too small of a margin to worry about.
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|I watch it and yet often think it is depressing and much too cynical.  Nonetheless the acting is good enough.  The sound is not great and sounds mumbling which is a problem.  Can you improve the audio quality.  It doesnot happen with Covert Affairs.
B00BDAP66E|4.0|This application was a life saver for my business Facebook page. I was having trouble doing anything on it or make changes until I found this application. Without this I would have closed my page. I recommend this for everyone. Great application n easy to follow n use.
014312093X|3.0|John le Carre's \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy\\" (TTSS) practically invented the genre of \\"realistic\\" spy fiction.  In these books the spies bear no resemblance to James Bond.  They are cuckolds, secret bisexuals, amoral bureaucrats, and Soviet moles.  They are nondescript men who scheme for promotions.  They work in shabby offices and lie to each other.  There is no glamor, heroism, or comraderie.  Even the sex is unsatisfying.    Amazon reviewers who complain about TTSS' convoluted plot have a point:  I would defy anyone to explain all the twists and turns after one reading.  However, the book is very smart on the culture of espionage:  the jargon and tradecraft seem authentic, the observations of middle-aged male psychology are shrewd, and the understanding of the bureaucratics and paranoia of the intelligence world is deep. In this warped universe, aging spies soldier on and on in spite of marginal results, escalating costs, personal failures, and repeated PR disasters.  (Just think of Frank Wisner Sr. sending hundreds of agents to their deaths in Eastern Europe.  No wonder he blew his brains out.)  TTSS is a good yarn about men who lay traps for themselves by laying traps for each other.    I took off two stars mainly because le Carre takes the spook world seriously even though it really screams out for satire.  One TTSS subplot involves big shots at MI6 and Whitehall who salivate with glee over super-compartmentalized, specially-handled intel from a super-spy deep in the Kremlin.  They act like teenage boys reading porn.  In fact, the \\"secrets\\" have been fabricated by a double agent, and the big shots are dupes.  That makes the subplot funny, yet le Carre's tone is somber, almost funereal, here and everywhere else in TTSS.  Maybe le Carre saw no place for humor in \\"serious\\" literature.  Or maybe he still felt the allure of MI6 years after leaving its employment.  Either way, if Stanley Kubrick could make a funny movie about nuclear war, le Carre could have written a funny book about British intelligence.  They call it \\"the Circus,\\" after all.    Bottomline:  I liked TTSS very much, but I doubt I'll read it twice.  Readers should check it out of a library, not buy it on Amazon.  For my money, Graham Greene's \\"The Human Factor\\" is THE great spy novel in the English language.    Personal note:  In 1986, early in our marriage, my wife tape-recorded TTSS so that I could listen to it during my grueling commutes in Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, the book requires intense concentration just to be read.  It is impossible to listen to it and follow the story.  Nonetheless, it was a beautiful gift.  I'm glad I finally got around to reading the book.  Thanks, love!
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I consider myself a music fan (though I don't play anything) and Nirvana was one of the first bands I feel in love with as a teenager. So when I saw that David Grohl had directed this, I placed this movie on my must-watch list.  Just recently, I finally got around to watching it, and I'm glad I had.<br /><br />First of all, I'm impressed with Grohl's ability as a director. He does a great job of telling the story of a) Sound City and b)the Neve board, which are two things I've never heard about before this movie nor understood. I can't believe the quality of bands that have recorded in Sound City and the sheer number of great albums they produced, and they spanned a great variety of rock artists. And the whole analog recording that later battled digital? I didn't really comprehend it all, until this movie.<br /><br />It's a great story that brings you the rise and fall of Sound City, then the resurgence of it with Nevermind, and finally the last days as the music industry changed. What is good is Grohl connects you to the people who made Sound City, from the owners to the managers to the runners, and tying you emotionally to the studio and giving it its own soul. So there is an emotional reaction to the first fall, second rise, and last fall. But Grohl leaves the audience with a resurrection of Sound City, the Neve board, and breathes life into it by having all these associated artists from the past produce a compilation album. It leaves you feeling like all things are going to be ok and are right again. In these last scenese, it's also great to get a glimpse of how these artists work together to produce songs. It seems like I would never be capable of something like that and speaks to their genius and talents.<br /><br />It's a terrific story and a can't-miss for any audiophile or band member out there, especially if you connect with any of the 70s-90s rock bands.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Well written.  It was a great read.  Loved it!!!  I read it on vacation and did not want it to end.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Great game, fun and addicting.<br />Ads are annoying but can be looked passed overall its a very fun free game.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I am clumsy sometimes this has saved me more than once from my coffee water not to mention dropping now I'm not afraid to carry around more
B0047SKR54|5.0|A classic gem about the Vietnam era.  For which lessons were not learned, following 9/11, with wars in Iraq, Kabul, etc. - Military industrial complex meets Heart of Darkness.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|No lagging in the graphics. Fun for the horse lover, children and adults.<br />I would recommend this for anyone who loves horses.
B000GYI32M|3.0|The 3rd season is probably the worst of the 4, hands down.  However, as a big fan of Ben McKenzie's, it's always amazing to watch him and keep on discovering new ways that he conveys so much non-verbally.  Even if I've seen the scene or episode of the show (or film), I notice something new and subtle in his expressions and body language.  No matter how bad the writing or other aspects are, Ben sells it.
B008M721MS|1.0|I don't understand why but it won't sign me in. It says it doesn't recognize my skype name or password and they're both correct. Seems like it has a bug
B005CRQ2IU|4.0|Despite an explicit timeline taking place in 1985, the story and the art are remarkable relevant in 2013.  It lives up well to its reputation.
B00ANYJ3NI|3.0|Why does the author need to use bad language to get his point across?<br />Swearing takes one's mind off the subject of the book..
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My daughter and I are addicted!  This is a fun, creative game and we love it.  We cannot put it down.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Perhaps the most perfectly constructed &#34;time capsule&#34; we've seen.  My wife and I were mesmerized.<br /><br />We've sent copies to both of our brothers - with instructions to be ready to go back in time.<br /><br />Great job.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Matthew McConaughey had some really enjoyable lines in the movie.  The plot also kept me interested.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Have always loved watching this movie.  Just a great classic!  Arrived on time and packaging was fine.  Very satisfied with the purchase.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This book is amazing for any artist who's stuck in a rut creatively. It has you look at life from a slightly different angle that is very new and exciting, while still seeming like common sense. Quick read with a wealth of information!
1451695195|5.0|Excellent. Thank you so much for the experience of reading this book.<br />I recommend to all people in all walks of life.
B00296A4F4|5.0|It is new, refreshing, perhaps to some moderns a bit anachronistic, but for my generation, it is a breath of fresh air in the vast TV wasteland.
B004SKJTY6|3.0|It's only a longer trailer!  I thought it was a prime member movie.  NOT!  Still, looking forward to seeing the full movie one day.  Thank you.
B00498YZFK|5.0|the new Deliverence. Good movie but sad for this poverty stricken mountain family. Very good performance by Jennifer Lawrence character.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|Very capturing and funny and lovable characters.  Scary enough to Kee my attention and love the far out imagination of the writers.  Little uncomfortable with the forward ness of the content at times but overall, fabulous!  Thank you for the entertainment.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|I love this song! My new song on my workout playlist! Can't wait to hear the new album. She is back!!!!
B0012GMYUU|5.0|Bought this for the cut &#34;Dirty Minds&#34;.... but the whole CD is amazing. Jeff Beck just never ceases to knock me out.
B000006045|4.0|This is the first time buying a Massive Attack CD for me. I'm happy with the album, love most of the songs. Looking forward to purchasing more of their albums. I love their sound because they're different from the mainstream music industry. Reminds me of the psychedelic rock of Pink Floyd, who is one of my favorite bands.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|Nip/Tuck is an excellent show.  I have all six seasons and it is so disturbing at times that it is hard to look away.<br /><br />Plastic surgery and their often plastic although not too fantastic lives.<br /><br />I would suggest not sitting down until you have all six seasons as this series is too hard to stop watching!<br /><br />One of my very favourites!
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Ordered this to help protect my new I-Phone 4 because I carry the insurance on the phone and did not want to pay $50 for some of the phone protectors out there.  Anyway, this is a good product.  It fits my phone well and does provide some protection (which is what I expected for what I paid for it).  I like the fact that the edges come up over my phone and actually help hold my screen protector in place.  I would order it again if I needed another one.
B005HEFB6M|5.0|Love it...star trek!  Thank you so much Amazon for keeping the good scifi shows. The show is a great blend of scifi and history.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I truly recommend it to anyone who likes to read about real history of religions (beyond the mitos and legends).
B009ME47H2|4.0|This is a good, simple, and intuitive app that does what's promised.  It records well.  I just wish it could also be used to record phone calls, but otherwise, no complaints.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|silly entertainment! ! lots of fun.. not hard. clean fun for kids and redundant fun for adults. worth down loading and trying.
B000056VJ7|4.0|What a throw back!  I loved the few songs and had fun with my friends remembering our high school days.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love being able to listen to a wonderful voice reading passages of scripture. I can do the dishes to the book of James, do laundry to Job, mop the floor to Exodus and discover passages I might have missed before. Because of the intelligent inflection of the reader, I often understand things on a new level. I can read it also, of course, in a large font and in whatever version I wish for that day. Great app!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|what i said for the fith season goes for all of them<br />i truly recomend it, you´ll have a very, very good time.
B008K7RGA2|5.0|This TOSCA could hv been the finest Tosca ever if Mme. Callas had been alive joining Kaufman and Terfel .  The men are great singing actors musicians.  I hv seen other performances of TOSCA by Ghoergiu -- there is just something flat about her performance.  The performance is OK -- but doesn't stand up to the men here.  Ah, if only Callas was still alive young and singing.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|what i said for the fith season goes for all of them<br /><br />i truly recomend it, you´ll have a very, very good time.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|great CD, happy i bought it. Kanye is a great artist. i love it. its great get hype music with meaning
B0060MYK7G|5.0|what i said is for the 3 seasons.<br />it´s a wondefull tv series, so well donde and well acted, each setting seems a painting from the renaissance.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|we are we going to be able to get this game for the kindle??? I am very disappointed that you don't have candy crush for the kindle yet
B0032UYFA6|5.0|what i said for the fith season goes for all of them.<br /><br />i truly recomend it, you´ll have a very, very good time.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Well written historical novel by Ken Follet.  As usual, brilliant.  However, the book does bog down in spots with tedious decriptions of the characters dress.  Leaves one looking forward to the next installment of the series.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|I think it's because of the big build up, I was expecting more. For me Lincoln Lawyer was much better. The acting was very good it's just the plot dragged on. What really lost me was trying to sell me on Reese Witherspoon being a beautiful hard drinking, trashy sex pot... I was like really? Reese Witherspoon? She was so misscast in this film.
B002AWX6UM|4.0|It was very moving and filled with suspense. A good example of the war and the tragedy of being a child soldier
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Every time I watch an episode I can't stop. The script is very real, the characters are fun and the subject matter is my favorite.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I rated Downton Abbey five stars  because it is the best program about how the English aristocracy and its servants lived in the early 2oth century.  Combine the details of that relationship with superb acting and beautiful scenery and one can't help but &#34;love&#34; the program.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really felt connected to this book. There is nothing I would change or add. It was sad at the end, but it was memorable and I really am glad that I read it. It made me cry , but I got the point where I fell in love with Augustus so it was hard for me to see him go even though it's not real.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Keeps it on his desk.  Lights up, great sound effects, cool conversation price.  Is his favorite Dr.  next to Tom Baker.  He has his scarf so this was perfect for him.
1609611543|3.0|Some very helpful information but after awhile I couldn't continue reading because it got a little to technical and chapter after chapter seemed to say the same thing over and over again.
B00AN9DOV0|5.0|Great characters and good moral.<br />Funny sequel.  The grandkids really love it.<br />Some very unexpected twists in the story line.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy to use product with intuitive ui. Makes remoting into my old windows 7 laptop now being used as a media server much more convenient.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Perhaps a Dalek summed up Christopher Ecclestone's version of The Doctor best ... &#34;You would have made a good Dalek&#34;, or words to that effect.  More of a hard doctor that the others both before (except for maybe William Hartnell) and after, I like it :-)
B004G8QTS4|4.0|This was a terrific sequel to The Dawn Patrol. Most of the same great characters especially Boone Daniels and lots of great surfing culture and lore. I can't wait for a third book and I hope the series will last beyond that.
B0071MQBX0|1.0|Love Ramin and Sierra.  Great songs and story.  I would highly recommend this.  I also purchased the soundtrack for this.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game its great for keeping my kids busy too. even off line its so much fun always new missions to beat!
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I liked the acting - and found the story intriguing but does there have to be so much doggone blood flying around - pretty graphic and disturbing scenes of violence
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Who wouldn't want to sink into the splendor and time warp that Downton Abbey provides? This season was no exception to the rule. A wonderful, funny, sad and interesting ride. Sign me up for another twenty years..This beautiful series just captivates me.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|This used to be one of my favorite apps on my kindle hd. But with the latest update its become unpleasant to use. The developer has decided for some stupid reason to switch from a portrait mode to a landscape mode showing you less of the playing screen. I no longer play this on my kindle and will tell my friends to avoid this.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love to play this game. Very addictive. Can play for hours and NEVER get tired of the game. Awesome game
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|About as bad a film as I've seen.  Actors pretty much taking a paycheck.  Almost as bad as the Expendables series.  Totally inconceivable.
B00DLKXF3A|4.0|OK, I will get right to it. Avenged Sevenfold is a great band, with an amazing amount of talent. They have varied their sound on each album, and they have done it well every time. I was especially impressed with Nightmare due to the complexity of the music, the dual guitar harmonies, the incredible drumming, and the varied vocal approaches. They have proven they can play anything, and play it very well. This album is no different. The first track, Shepherd of Fire, borrows heavily from Metallica, with both the guitar riffs and drums sounding very much like Enter Sandman. Hail to the king borrows heavily from ACDC's thunderstruck on the opening guitar riff, and continues into a Metallica like heavy riffed, mid-tempo song. The solo on this song is very catchy, as well as the vocal chorus. It's a great song. Doing time is also a very good song, and sounds like it would fit right in on a Guns and Roses Appetite era record. This means war starts out with Iron Maiden like dueling guitars, and Metallica like heavy riffs backed up by a background guitar harmony that would make any metal band proud, and then goes down a very familiar path, sounding just like Avenged Sevenfold has always sounded, which is awesome. Crimson Day is a great ballad, with many influences apparent. Heretic borrows very heavily from Megadeth, with the main guitar harmony sounding quite a bit like Hangar 18 by Megadeth. It's a great song, both heavy and catchy. Coming Home, which sounds almost exactly like Iron Maiden, from the guitar riffs, dueling guitar harmonies, the vocal pitch and the vocal content. Planets is a great song, and I will let you make a determination as to the inspiration behind it. With all of this said, it is very obvious that these guys were listening to Metallica, Iron Maiden, Guns and Roses, and Megadeth while recording this record. Luckily, those are 4 of the best metal bands on earth, and it would be a crime not to borrow from those sounds to make great music. This album is asolid 4.5, and anyone who likes A7X, any of the bands I mentioned, or metal in general should buy it. My only complaint, is that the aggression and the constant dueling guitar harmonies that Avenged is known for and showcased to an unbelievable amount in Nightmare have been toned back greatly, and the complexity is not nearly as apparent on Hail to the King. There is nothing wrong with that, but I think these guys are just incredible guitar players, and they should show off every chance they get. That is not to say there are not many guitar melodies and harmonies to be found on Hail to the King, there are, but it seems like they are holding back on them a lot of the time. I have to say that the new drummer could never replace Rev, and will obviously never aspire to be Portney, but the drumming is a little lackluster most of the album. He has some huge shoes to fill, and it may be impossible for anyone to fill them. The ode to the Rev, King James, makes it obvious that he will always be a part of Avenged no matter what. Anyway, this is a great album, buy it! Great album guys! You are on your way to becoming a legendary metal act and it's well deserved.

B0061US58C|3.0|Someone else on here commented that this film was essentially just a James Bond movie - nothing more and nothing less - and they are 100% correct.  If you go into it expecting the same type of movie as the original Cars, you will be disappointed.  If you go into it with no expectations, you will probably enjoy it for the humor and action.  And that's the main problem.  Anyone watching this movie is most likely doing so because they liked the original movie Cars.  Cars was a terrific little movie overflowing with emotional content - from the sadness of the forgotten town, through the sadness of the forgotten race car (Doc/Hornet), to the developing emotional connections between Lightning and Mater and of course, Lightning and Sally.  Anyone going to watch Cars 2 will get _none_ of that.  Zero.  Zip.  Nada.  Aside from one brief attempt where Lightning gives a speech about friendship (which ultimately comes off very flat), there is no emotion whatsoever.  Even Lightning and Sally's relationship is downplayed when she continuously makes comments about how &#34;hot&#34; another race car looks.  Add to that the fact that Lightning McQueen isn't even the main character any more having been relegated to what is, essentially, a secondary role.  Mater takes center stage in this one and it's a straight up spy/Man who knew too little expose.  Which works just fine and is entertaining in its own right.  It's just not what we have come to expect from the fine story weaving folks at Pixar.  In the end, Cars 2 did not work very well for me.

B0072NWJRK|5.0|Absolutely, without doubt, the best book i've read in many years.  Superbly written with all the intrigue and  mystery of the ancient orient we read about from childhood into adulthood.  Can only imagine the tenacious fortitude needed to research information to bring this book to print.  A life that without the efforts of Paul French, would have been long forgotten and buried in passing years.  I consider the book not only a fabulous look at the China/Peking of the late 30's, but also brings into life the many photo's I have of old china left to me by my father during his U.S. Naval years in many of the China ports.  The poverty, the excesses, the mystery, the &#34;anything for a price&#34; he would tell me about.  I, and feel all readers of this exquistely crafted story, accept this as a tribute to a life cut short, left in limbo and finally unraveled and brought to light.  Thank you Mr. French!  I look forward to more of your well penned writing.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|We love this show,  unfortunately the instant video would pause constantly forcing us to stop.  We finally had to go to a different website to watch.  This happened on every episode of the season on Amazon.  Definitely disappointed with having renewed my subscription.
B002GKQ5MY|1.0|Tried to give this show a chance but there is no point.  There is more the life and love than sex no matter which gender you prefer.  This show seems to be missing that.
B006LSZECO|5.0|AT FIRST, I WASN'T SURE THAT I WOULD ENJOY THIS READ...BUT AS I GOT FARTHER INTO THE STORY, I KNEW IT WOULD BE ANOTHER THAT WAS HARD TO PUT DOWN...........
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The last episode of season 2 is some of the best writing I've seen in a series, and so feel-good -- lots of people doing their best in difficult situations and friends and relatives giving good counsel to those in need.  Very gratifying.  I love that people are trying to be moral and respectful.  You don't see much of that nowadays.

B008BQ8VOC|3.0|I really love this show. But I ended up having to stop because of the language. I know it's just probably the way everyone talks but I felt that if I was worried about my kids overhearing it then I should probably not be watching it.  Too bad.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Well written, balanced, nuanced. A great story told well. The characters come alive, from FDR to Lindbergh, and many others almost lost to history. This period makes our current nasty politics seem pale indeed. Highly recommend this book.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|It's just a very , clean funny movie thats rather true to the way it is when getting ready for Christmas...............
B0084TWN9K|5.0|I enjoyed the stories in this collection so much. It takes a really good writer to produce a good short story; Alice Munro is a good writer. Sometimes the endings leave you hanging but I like that because I can create my own ending in my mind. Some peopleare bothered by that. If you love short stories, I highly suggest you read these.
B008KP2VZY|5.0|I use this app to sync my unrooted galaxy sII my NAS via samba share.  It backs up all my pictures and videos.

B009AMAGQM|4.0|I liked the movie, but after seeing it, it didn't climb up there on my favorites list. I didn't even know they were turning the book into a movie until a week before it came out in theaters. The characters the picked to play surprised me but I think they all did a great job acting the parts. I like the series in general so all in all it was a good movie.
1936719029|5.0|Love the book - A great one to pick up and read when you're looking to procrastinate (and know you're slacking off/resisting).<br />Shared it with my fellow women biz owners.
B0043U7XJO|3.0|Yep, another Robin Hood movie.  The cast is pretty good and the story is actually a prequal to the other Robin Hood stories your familiar with.  It's entertaining, but it's also largely predictable.  Sometimes I want a predictable action flick with some decent acting.  What's wrong with that?
037582913X|5.0|I believe a lot of people can cite \\"The Monster At the End of This Book\\" as one of the first books they remember reading as a child.  Not only because it featured a beloved character from a TV show many children grew up watching, but because it was probably their first exposure to an interactive story -- instead of simply reading a pre-written tale, children felt they were interacting with Grover himself, and that their actions affected the story itself.  Before this book, not many children's books experimented with breaking the fourth wall and addressing the reader directly, and in this sense \\"Monster\\" was ahead of its time.<br /><br />I recently purchased this book for a friend's baby shower gift, and she, too, said it was one of her absolute favorite books as a child and she was eager to share it with her own son when he was old enough.  It's heartening to know that a simple children's book can be so beloved by all ages.<br /><br />As stated before, what makes \\"Monster\\" unique is that it's main character, Grover, is fully aware that he's in a book, and tries to tell the reader to not turn the pages -- because the further you read, the closer you get to the end of the book, where supposedly a monster lurks.  Grover pleads with the reader, and even resorts to increasingly silly methods to keep the reader from turning the pages.  There's even a bit of suspense built up as Grover's fear builds with every page turned, and one can't help but feel a little sorry for him.  Naturally, I won't spoil the ending, and I doubt any reader, no matter the age, is going to stop reading to the very end despite all Grover's best efforts.<br /><br />Also, the art bears mention -- it's a loose and sketchy style, in contrast with the later Sesame Street books that would have relatively crisp and clean artwork, and very few of the pages have actual backgrounds.  But I actually rather liked it as a kid, and I still like it now.  The story is very simple and no-frills, and so the artwork is made to match.  Also, it's nice to have a unique art style in a TV-spinoff book, where most books based on a TV show have generic-looking \\"canned art\\" instead of much in the way of creativity.<br /><br />A fun and unique read for young children, this is a must for any child's library.  Young readers will enjoy feeling that they have control over the story, and giggling along to Grover's antics.is made to match.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I saw the History Channel version before I saw the movie.  History Channel wins. However, Daniel Day Lewis is amazing and I kinda felt like I was watching the real Lincoln up there on screen.  I'm not sure it's all that historically accurate.  I'm an engineer, not a historian.  It just felt like he was a little too enlightened for that time period.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This is a really well thought out and put together book<br /><br />It's a recipe book with so much more.. it essentially helps you create, mix and match beautiful and practical meals which not only taste amazing but are good for health too

0307271609|5.0|\\"Empress Dowager Cixi: The Concubine Who Launched Modern China\\" by Jung Chang (Oct. 2013).<br /><br />[My interest in China started back in 1963 when, at my request for my high-school World Studies class, I received an autographed photograph from ROC Pres. Chiang Kai-shek - okay, so condemn me for being a \\"name dropper\\".]  Born in Nov. 1835, the Chinese Empress Dowager Cixi essentially controlled the Manchu Qing Dynasty from 1861 to her death in late 1908.<br /><br />During her reign she supported the Boxer Rebellion/Uprising (c. 1900) which sought to oust foreign (European) trade control and pro-democracy influences in China, but led to the Empress fleeing her throne room as foreign military forces entered Peking (Beijing).  A negative depiction of her was impressed upon the American conscience in the 1963 war film: \\"55 Days at Peking\\".<br /><br />This book's China-born author, Jung Chang, argues that the commonly perceived repressive Cixi was actually more \\"progressive\\" than her detractors acknowledge.  The author attempts to rehabilitate the Empress Cixi.<br /><br />No need to recount Cixi's entire bio here; the author provides a very extensive 370 pages detailing Cixi's interesting, complex life.  But why did she fail to preserve the Imperial way - just three years after her death when the Republican government was proclaimed by Sun Yat-sen?  Could Cixi have forestalled the kingdom's demise with political reforms - or was she just giving lip service to reforms as if merely rearranging deck chairs on an already floundering ship-of-state?<br /><br />Besides calls for political reforms from the ever toiling and over-taxed peasants, foreign powers grabbed at China's wealth.  As the author noted, \\"The Treaty of Shimonoseki [which in 1895 forced China to pay massive, debilitating funds to Japan for the return of the Liaodong Peninsula] ruined China\\" (p. 201) ... The life-blood was being pumped out of China ... her accusers have asserted that she depleted the navy in order to build her Summer Palace\\" the author claimed that Cixi \\"was the only person in the court who unambiguously advocated rejecting Japan's demands  and fighting on\\" (p. 202).<br /><br />And then the Germans began demanding special control over certain Chinese territories, along with other countries, such as Russia.  And opium was made more readily available to the Chinese people to generate revenue to repay foreign loans.<br /><br />Ah, yes, high government expenses, weak revenues; threatening foreign military forces versus the poorly trained Chinese army that was ill equipped to fight them off.  And the Emperor was  weak-willed, and the administrative courtiers were corrupt in seeking graft from the peasants.  The author noted that \\"Cixi's father was responsible for collecting taxes and, in line with prevailing and age-old practice, he fleeced the local population ... The he should do so was taken for granted ... Cixi grew up with corruption of this kind as a way of life\\" (p. 7-8).<br /><br />But the over-taxed peons eventually rebelled in the great Boxer Uprising.<br /><br />In response, the author contended that the Emperor \\"positively sought Cixi's guidance ... His office forwarded proposals about reforms to her ... He was the pupil, and she was the teacher\\".  A resulting edict \\"launched an historical movement, the Reforms of 1898\\", but while \\"History books ... invariably credit it to Emperor Guangxu\\" they \\"condemn Cixi as an ultra-conservative opponent\\" (p. 221).  The author contends that \\"The plain fact is that it was she who initiated the Reforms\\".  As Kitty Carlisle on \\"What's My Line\\" might ask: \\"So will the real Cixi please stand up?\\"<br /><br />The author continues for another 150 pages in her attempt to rehabilitate Cixi.  No need to list all of them here, except to say that the author has written, I believe, a very well researched and detailed biography of Empress Cixi, and presents well her arguments that Cixi was reform minded.<br /><br />But as myautographed photograph of Chiang Kai-shek reminds me, two former power greats of China failed to reform the mainland in time before being forced to flee the Forbidden City.

B001EN71CW|5.0|A great scifi western fusion that has an amazing likable cast of eclectic personalities. For such a short-lived series, it is beloved by good reason. I couldn't recommend the complete series of Firely enough to do it justice. Therefore, buy it and get lost in the humorous and enjoyable adventure that is Firefly.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I am so sorry that I did not know this was on when it was on. A friend just alerted me to the series and I am half way; through season two and had to come home so have ordered this set.  It is a wonderful as Upstairs/Downstairs,  Malice Aforethought, Keeping up Appearances and AS Time Goes By.  The actors are perfectly placed, the plots amazing and there is never a dull moment or a surprise outcome.  It is just loads of fun to predict the outcome and then be so very wrong - which I have been so far.  Whoever casted this show did a perfect job and the writer must be an amazing person to meet.  I am looking forward to season four in January and will also purchase that and any subsequent series.  Thanks for asking!!

B00AHGSVKS|4.0|I have read Clarke's 2001 series, but nothing else by him so far. Man what an imagination. Okay, it was written in the 50's, and the whole Alien looking like a Devil was...different, but as you read the story you see why that was the case. I intend to read more of Clarke's books in the future..
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Really liked the movie. Cruise was great and the story was not near as bad as I've heard.  Overall a thoroughly entertaining film.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|Love this music by Cyndi Lauper.  Saw the play on Broadway and Billy Porter rocks as does the whole cast and music.
B00DGKQF2S|3.0|Meh...it isn't horrible. But it's certainly not going to get a lot of play time in my system. Sort of just OK generic rock and roll. Nothing special here. I really think this is a big step down for Portnoy.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Exciting and grity series. This show is a lot of fun and draws you in. I can watch each episode over and over
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|It's better. Lots better than any thing Phil did. If you like \\"And then there were three\\" and before Genesis you'll love this. It's that with modern influence. Really good modern prog. With just a bit of polish around the edges this kid is set to shine. Fantastic album.

B001OKKRSK|5.0|I love this movie... it's everything, it's entertainment at its finest.  Let me explain, this movie will shock you the first time, maybe even bring you to tears.  But that's only the beginning with this classic.  The depth of the characters, the charming actors, and the quick witted dialogue of the film will bring you back for more time and time again.  This movie allows one to view couples as they really are, and not as thought upon first glance.  I could say more, but I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Suffice to say, it's a comedy, a drama, a romance, and my... favorite movie.

0062082353|2.0|A lot technical machinery and artillery I found hard to follow.<br />Not an easy book to read. unless perhaps you are military.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|The CD was great!!!!  I love Bruno Mars!!!  Every song is great.  Grenade is one of my favorite songs.  They are all fabulous.
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Great show lots of turns. Great motorcycles Crime does not pay. I just cannot wait until next season.  Lots of action.
159463176X|5.0|This is the type of book that you can't put down.  Great beach read.  I have read all his books.  The Kite Runner is still my favorite.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|A. It's *awwwwwesome* to see good ol' Werner Herzog as bad guy. A very VERY bad guy. He ate his own fingers! He wants you to do so too!<br /><br />B. Jack Reacher is a one man A-Team, minus B.A. Baracas, and he doesn't mind killing those who need killin'. Also, he can prevent domestic violence.<br /><br />Do you want to see a one-man A-Team kill baddies and get/mete out justice for those in need gettin' it? Then watch this movie, by all means. I did, and I enjoyed the two hours or so required to do so, enough so that I've written this review.
B008JFUO4U|3.0|Robotic acting provided by the entire cast is propped up against a green screen of death and colored over with CGI.<br />I did like the noise the drones made which was reminiscent of the mothership in Close Encounters.
0060229357|3.0|Interesting for 3 yr old, but doesn't hold his attention for the whole video--nor did it at 2yrs old.<br /><br />I liked it, but, unfortunately, I wasn't the target audience.
B00ECUARO8|2.0|A bad guy is hiding from badder guys and is hero worshipped by a boy with anger issues. And Hollywood gets away with it again.
B0094M4OW0|3.0|Will Smith made the movie - solid performance - definitely worth a watch if you need to get more insight into Hot Fuzz.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Not only will you hear great music and learn some history but you'll get inside the minds of some of Rock and Rolls greatest musicians.  Oh and Barry Manilow.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|All the features work good. For people who like having fb at the touch of the fingertip.. I like it
B002DEZXOE|4.0|This was during my time I just wasn't able to attend so nice to see it so well portrayed.<br />Rock and Roll will never die and the spirit of people will never be defeated.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It is so important for people to understand this history, even if they choose to deny it. It may even open some minds.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Just started and find this GAME is not the typical ho GAME.  I am still figuring out what and how to collect items for my inventory and how to get the collections needed to progress.  So far I'm intrigued and feel challenged.  The developers of this GAME obviously put a lot of thought into it.  It's challenging and looks like it's going to be fun.  Clearly, it will require some strategy and, as one reviewer stated, patience.  So many games take only a few hours to complete, but I think this one is designed to keep you going for a looooong time.  I'm looking forward to that adventure.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is absolutely fantastic. It is indeed the game I've been searching for for a while now. It has everything I look for in a perfect game. It has the perfect balance of difficulty. It starts out easy but as you move up in levels it gets more challenging. It does not get too challenging to the point of not wanting to play anymore however, which is exactly what I like. It also has a great amount of levels. I hate fun games that are way too short, but this game has alot of levels and is sure to keep you busy for a good amount of hours. The game play is very simple wich adds to the fun of it. And the over all concept is adorable. I like the theme of buttons and scissors I think it's very cute. I would highly recommend this game to everyone, considering its free right now, believe me, that adds to the perks. I love this game. I have been playing it everyday since u downloaded it. It's great
B000002W9Q|5.0|I could be biased but I love everything about Dirty Dancing. i love to just listen to this dvd on the way to work.
B00DNO3JUI|4.0|It was not a great movie by any stretch I did however enjoy seeing Holly Hunter in a role I wouldn't have imagined her in if asked who should play this part. It was also enjoyable to see Harvey Keitel in a slightly different role but not completely out of character. The story was of interest too but very superficial and unrealistic in many ways, such as a hand carved piano sitting on the beach in the tideway in the ocean's spray for days remaining in perfect condition.
B00000F566|5.0|This is my all time favorite movies. It's about a girl growing up and turning into a woman over the summer. There's a lot more to it than that but I don't want to give anything good away.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I wanted to like this book, and decided to buy it even after considering all the reviews I'd read, but it was not worth the money or the time.  I understand the timeline overlapped, but there was hardly any storyline and the characters did not seem to progress at all throughout the mid-thousand pages.  Character's lines were repeated over and over, it seemed like every paragraph in Jon's chapters talked about the weather, etc.  I'll probably still buy the next one the day it comes out though.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Keeps you in suspense the whole time.  Robie's experiences has taught him invaluable wisdom.  Sometimes the ending is surprising to the reader.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Legal shows one of my favorites.  Sometimes the storyline is difficult to follow in Suits--but that's probably my lack of concentration.  LOVE Gabriel Macht!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great characters, descriptive writing.  Who knew your sub conscience had so much to say.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00942Y4IY|5.0|Great scifi. Crying Game is great too. It is the movie that launched it all again after Trek. Would be great to see another SG movie.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is great!  I Love Jace.  Clary is a bit whiny, but hey all girls can't be bad**ses like Isabelle.  Hoping to see the movie, but worried that it won't be as good as the book.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|Great love story, I bet the play is spectacular. Would recommend to any one, good for all ages. High marks.
B00CEZJT2E|2.0|I read the reviews and decided to buy it, and the next week I bought one for my girlfriend too. My mistake not to use it before buying the next. I have a HTC One and I see anker products are also the same crap that all batteries. is 6000mAh and I only charge once and 20% before my battery runs out. Being 6000mAh would have to recharge my phone twice minimum.<br /><br />I give it two stars because I like the design. But I recommend you buy it.<br />Amazon knows that today I bought two L50X2M Burst Limeade, I hope this if works.
B000P407K4|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Peter Sellers is great in three different roles but is funniest as Dr. Strangelove himself.
B0081JPTCQ|3.0|Handy note pro is an ok app.  Would be 5 stars better with a little documentation. The slide show tells next to nothing. Description is some what mis leading on some of its features On whats included and what has to be paid for. Plan to hold onto in hope of improvment.
B008JFUN6E|1.0|I really liked the commercial for this movie, so I ended up watching it. i thought this movie would be great, where Matt is going to up there and save the day and all. He did do that but the movie made him to be too much of a selfish jerk and by the time he did save everyone, I just didn't care! The movie also focuses on too much of the polite background in this movie. Time and time again, we have to hear and see about the reason why Elysium is chaos. There is a power struggle from within and on Earth too. But, the main politice is within and who is in power and there is a LOT of backstabbing going around. After watching all that, I really didn't care to see Matt save the day as, I thought they should all just die! I will NOT recommend this movie.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|But I dont need to tell you that.  If you know about Serenity or Firefly then you probably have already seen it and agree.  If you havent yet seen either then please start with the TV Show before you watch the movie.  I also envy you greatly as I wish I could watch them over for the first time.<br /><br />Its a travesty there hasn't been further movie/tv shows in the series.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very good sitcom that reels you in from the very first episode. There is a lot of witty banter and stylish outfits too.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|How do you not like this?  It costs a dollar but it is definantly the best racing game on the market.  You can do a few tricks crash other people and get nitrous boosts.  Try it out its only one dollar.
1781162646|5.0|Read this book in about 3 days, was sorry when it ended. He still has &#34;it&#34;<br />I have read about 20 of his books.
140006922X|4.0|Zealot is an extremely insightful point of view that provides the missing context to the story of the creation of Christianity. It get's slightly soft in some places where Aslan dips in and out of story telling and religious sensitivity without clearly delineating it, but that may have helped with making the book as readable as it is, and increasing the viable audience.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|Fun is just to much &#34;Fun&#34; This group is one of the best I have heard in years. Love all that they do.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Deathly Hallows was one of the best of the series. We had the opportunity to purchase the 2nd part, but not the first half. Great ending to a great series.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was so happy to be able to see the second season, it is the best I can't wait until the next season begins
B00003CXI1|5.0|This was our first experience with the Harry Potter series.. we all fell in love with the characters, esp. Harry, Ron and Hermione.. what a wonderful cast of characters.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|Awful cinematography. Just a bad movie altogether. We were disappointed, we were hoping for a movie that did the book justice.
B002DQDV6Y|5.0|One of the greatest movies ever! My entire family loves Harry Potter! We needed this on DVD.. b/c we still had the VHS.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|This genre is alittle different for JM. I am used to his R&B roots; which he finesses quite well! I love his Stevie Ray Vaughn and Buddy Guy feel. PARADISE VALLEY has a cowboy feel to it and I kinds like his change up on this Cd. This was released on my birthday and I happened to be @ The Smokies in top of mtn when I first heard the it. Paradise Valley made my b-day complete!! Way to go JCM!!! We love you!! ( :
B00EDF43MY|5.0|Bought all the Dr Panda apps for my 6 years old daughter, she absolutely love it. I personally think it a brilliant apps, all of them...well done
B0060MYK7G|5.0|Fantastic. The sets were very realistic as were the costumes and the environment. I loved being transporter to the 15-16 century. Acting was superb, and will watch it again. Must see this intriquing story about the papacy.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I like it even though I am relaxing I can train my mind to find things to be faster. I enjoy been able to search for things the graphics are good very nice.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|One of the best movie ever, I love the story line and all the actors did a fantastic job. Thanks for making this movie.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|A good app to keep you informed about the latest weather news and up to date forecasts on weather news local and world wide
0399255370|5.0|This item was great, and I highly recommend this book.  As an adult, I loved it, and I bought it to read to a classroom of kids!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|A great app for bingo players with rewards and upgrades available thru group or solo play .fun by yourself ,or fun groups to join with friends
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Listen we all love this game so I'm going on my best review<br />And it is a some good game if it was on Xbox even better
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Nice,  and like the effects found in the movie. will see it again and other related movies to this role.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Enjoyed this movie with popcorn and soda. Also, my favorite pillow and blanky. I hope you like this movie too!
B00A7YZ1KI|3.0|This was a good book if it had been another link in the series but it wasn't this was the final book so I expected fireworks from the start and an explosive finish along with a happily ever after. That's not what I got. (may contain spoilers)<br /><br />Eric how has been most peoples favorite doesn't make it into the second half of the book and only appears once or twice through out the whole book. Bill isn't interesting before.<br /><br />There is no romance a tall in this book right until the closing chapters which  makes its seam rushed and unbelievable because there was not chemistry between these two characters before.<br />To me this booked created more loose ends trying to develop some sort of story line and was completely separate from the rest of the series and at the end she ties them up but it just seemed like she had ran out of good story material so such grabbed a few different ideas and threw them at the book.<br /><br />I gave it three stars because she is a fabulous writer still and you do want to find out what happens but that is only because of lead up to the final and when you get to the end of this book it all a bit disappointing.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I bought this dvd for my daughter and she loved it. I loved the price! Got to love this classic show.
B000W8HC8I|3.0|It was okay, but went too far to be at all believable.  It was like the author was going as far as possible to shock.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This is a pleasant easy-read and a fair airplane or beach book.<br /><br />The book struggled with and ultimately failed to mingle fairy tale fantasy with the parallel story of a young boy struggling to grow and understand the world.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|but after 1 week of downloading it into the Kindle it is asking me to upgrade it and I have to go through google and stuff.. too much of a hassle.<br />But it works fine..
B0044RUSZM|4.0|Very sleek looking and holds the laptop up to a very comfortable viewing level.  Looks good too (much better than the cardboard box I was using to elevate the laptop until now, ha).  The little plastic stoppers on the end of the arms do help to secure the laptop and I don't think I would like this without them.<br /><br />My only complaint is that when I go to type anything (don't always bring it down to type just for a few words or a password here and there), it bounces.  That was unexpected, thought it would be much firmer of a support.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|Enjoyed it!  Kinda grainy on the blu ray but what can you expect from a movie of this age?  Otherwise, quite entertaining.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|It's a classic! What else can you say???!!! Audrey singing &#34;Moon River&#34;. Lovers love love :) This movie is all love!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. In my opinion there isn't a better show on television right now. Obviously, true to the period with meticulous details it is beautifully written, acted and I enjoy the pacing of all three seasons.
B003FIUTA0|5.0|The acting was superb, the costumes- beautiful, and the screenplay -unbeatable.  In my opinion, this is undoubtably the most majestic movie made.
B0080R7Q70|5.0|I'm new to The Flower Kings, so take this as an outsider's (and old fart's) view. I've only recently come across this Swedish prog band, (the only other thing I'd heard was their first [[ASIN:B000056V9N Back in the World of Adventures]], which frankly I was not overly impressed with - good, but too derivative sounding, although probably something I'd have enjoyed a lot more as a teen), yet my second impression of them with this latest recording is very positive. There is the obvious influence of early Genesis (their label IS called Foxtrot), with many obvious similarities to the sound and sensibility of guitarist Steve Hackett, but also with some sudden changes that remind me of a kinder-gentler King Crimson. And then there is the contrast of vocals that at first seem slight, but to be generous can be described as smooth, almost like an early 70's R&B sound (which at many points reminds me of George Duke, when he was with Zappa), crossed with the thin gentle tenor harmonies of Yes, lulling us with sweetness just before a wickedly complex instrumental break. This makes for an interesting mix of influences, and although I was at first reluctant to accept it, it works!<br /><br />This is no prog-rock masterpiece from the 70's (like the [[ASIN:B001R4MEUM Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]), but it is solidly \\"progressive\\", has a live-in-studio sound, with many beautiful symphonic moments, soaring guitar solos and exciting interplay, and is easy to sit back and just listen to. These guys have talent (and have done a great job of synthesizing their influences) - band leader Roine Stolt on a variety of lead guitars/processors is inventive and fluid, and well matched by the varied keyboards of Tomas Bodin. In fact, the whole band sounds really tight and comfortable together, and the sounds they forge, while deeply rooted in these classic prog influences (Genesis, King Crimson, Yes, Zappa), are also modern and bright and light (have we really entered a \\"new age\\"?). Disc 1 is the main 53 minute \\"Banks of Eden\\" album, with disc 2 being 22 minutes of slightly less polished bonus tracks, and a 21 minute band interview (which I haven't watched yet).<br /><br />The music here is of consistent quality throughout, and while not great, is damn good! 4+ stars (but I'm giving a 5 based on the quality of \\"Numbers\\" alone!)ain 53 minute \\"Banks of Eden\\" album, with disc 2 being 22 minutes of slightly less polished bonus tracks, and a 21 minute band interview (which I haven't watched yet).<br /><br />The music here is of consistent quality throughout, and while not great, is damn good! 4+ stars (but I'm giving a 5 based on the quality of \\"Numbers\\" alone!)
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a well researched book about the life and time of Jesus. Author has done a marvelous job at separating the myth from reality of the times. Unless you are writing History as an eye witness, the next best think is to put together the most realistic scenario and that is what the author has done with this book.<br />It was hard for me to put the book down till I finished. It was an excellent lesson in history. I learned about life and culture of Jews from two thousand years back. I would give it a thumbs up and urge anyone who has interest in History and life of Jesus to read this book.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|THE MOVIE  WAS TERRIFIC. I DON'T THINK IT WAS AS GOOD AS THE TRILOGY.  I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE IT MORE THAN ONCE TO APPRECIATE IT.  I RECEIVED IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. IT WAS IN GREAT WORKING CONDITION.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I got this printer specifically for the e-ptint feature to print from my ipad and phone.  A little hard to set up but it all went well.  I have printed emails so far but have not printed photos as of yet
B007R3AZNK|5.0|HE IS A MASTER BLUES GUITARIST. THERE IS NO ONE THAT CAN PLAY LIKE HE DOES! GREAT CD!!!! BUY IT. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.
B0013D8JAQ|5.0|This is an excellent Jesus & Mary Chain release that every alternative music fan should own without fail. The songwriting is solid, execution flawless and each member pulls their own with interestingly intriguing melody lines and contrasting canvases provided by a solid rhythm section. This release does NOT date itself like a lot of releases during the era. The song, Head On, makes it complete. A must have no doubt.
B000641Z90|5.0|Not Phil at his best or his youngest obviously but it is a great production and he sang all the songs I have always liked.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|History that few realize.  Most Americans are unaware of this part of World War II.  Follett 's research is impeccable
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Extremely fun and addicting game, some nights I lose sleep trying to beat my own score. Its very entertaining. Stimulating!
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  It make you rethink about everyday life choices.  This maybe a movie but, the plot and story line were clean.  I loved the fact that it had a moral sense that didn't overwhelm the plot and story line.  The idea of doing the right thing in life does not happen to strike feeling in many people but, this movie makes people rethink about the doing what is right.  It has a funny sense of portraying love but, that is ok. Miyazaki did a good job on this anime.
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Find I frequently use it instead of my phone when traveling, much easier to see. Quick to get on internet and email, keeps me in touch. Would recommend it to all Kindle owners.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Do not like the new format. Would have liked to have a choice to upgrade or not. Will look for a new app.
B0040JCJOC|4.0|Id forgotten how good this album is. Makes me sad that their AMAZING saxist is no longer with us..this is a really, REALLY good album..
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everyone should watch!! we are hooked, great story line and great ending, can't wait for season 4, on our toes~Lucy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a fun game. you can enter in compititions. my two oldest dauters play this game. that's how awesome it is
B007R108WA|5.0|This movie is soooo good that if you watch it quietly you can actually smell the aromas and imagine what a body's perfume may smell like.
B009IA9OLE|4.0|I just wish that there was a walk through and better understanding of the game but other then that good game
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Best book ever highly recommend this book my favorite so far.<br />Probably better for an older kid about 5th grade and up once again best book ever.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|I have been a fan of these guys since [[ASIN:B000HWXS2S With Oden on Our Side]], and in my opinion, they get better with each release.  This is another solid album full of epic riffs and Viking-themed lyrics.  The production is even bigger and heavier on this one than on previous albums (and that's saying something).  If you're an Amon Amarth fan, I don't think you'll be disappointed.  If you are checking the band out for the first time, you could do worse than to start here.<br /><br />As for the Deluxe edition, the packaging is really nice.  The EP of 4 songs written and performed in the styles of bands who influenced them is an amusing novelty that I probably won't listen to more than two or three times.  That alone is not worth a ton of extra money unless you are a collector.  The real value is in the album itself.
B004SC8YH2|5.0|Saw Chris Cross, in Cape May, NJ, in July 2013 & he reflected on some of the<br />songs in this album, performing a few....like &#34;Hey Kid&#34;. Good stuff. Why doesn't he<br />get Michael McDonald to the &#34;Ride Like The Wind&#34; live stuff -LOL?!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Outstanding diversion.  Keeps you challenged.  Great game for keeping the mind alert.  Makes you think quickly.  Great exercise for eyes also.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|This is a lot of actual kind of  mind<br /><br />game. It's very cool how much you have to do to find the hidden things you need to get out of these rooms. YOU should give it a try,WARNING, this game is not for quitters.<br />U
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|Who would think that a movie about a German sub and their crew would keep one's interest for over 3 hours?  It did mine.  You really feel like you were right there the whole time, fearing the inevitable.  I was sure I knew how it would end.... but I won't ruin it for the reader here.  Take my word for it, it's worth watching the movie to the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great I love it so much I'm literally addicted to it maybe it's because I love horses so much but can't afford one but o well this will do for now!
B001LRJH0K|5.0|Appaloosa is one of the finest unsung westerns in my opinion.  Perhaps in the top five of the last 20 years.  There's not a lot to say that hasn't been said.  The cast is superb (with the exception of Renee Zellwegger; she's not terrible but I too feel she was miscast).  The direction by Harris is very solid.  The film transfer is very good and the sound is great.  I'd give this a solid four out of five for the technical aspects (ie sound and image) and five out of five for the actual film.  For my money it has some of the best gun battles ever committed to film- far more realistic than is typically portrayed.<br /><br />Don't miss out on this underrated gem, especially since the BD disc is currently under eight bucks!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is one of the most warm hearted tales that I've read in years.  I loved the book.  I highly recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|wasn't impressed til I started watching, then couldn't stop, til I finished all the episodes!!!! When's the next one going to air?????
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|harold and maude is  VERY FUNNY<br />funny and it has a GREAT plot i would definitely recommend this to some one who hasnt seen it its also
B004K4IZ54|5.0|The 3D for this movie pop out of the tv.  Too bad some of the movie was 2D. I've seen this movie multiple times and never get bored.
B004LROUW2|1.0|Murakami is known for creating dreamlike worlds that feel to the reader that they are being suspended in a dreamlike state. I'm a huge fan and have read every book...but on this one, did he simply wake from his dream and forget where he was?<br /><br />This was a painful slog for me, and I think it was for the author as well.  How else can you explain a rushed ending that leaves so much in the air, and so much unanswered? It was almost like he'd had enough and simply decided to pull the ripcord when he knew he had little time left in the air. After leading us along for over 1,000 pages of mostly nonsense the book ends the way it did? Really?!  I feel like I just got punk'd.<br /><br />I'm still a huge Murakami fan, but this one fell way flat.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I have always loved period pieces and this series is certainly no exception.  The acting is beyond exemplary and coupled with the feel of authenticity makes for great viewing.  I discovered this series just this year and have decided to view all episodes prior and have not been disappointed.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|If you lived the seventies like I did (I was in my twenties and immortal), this film is absolutely something to stir the memory pot. If you did not live them as I did, you'll be entertained at the very least.
B00DHHWXYY|2.0|If you start from the premise that this is a film about the corruption of wealth, and the failure of the Great American Dream, as Fitzgerald I think intended, then it really falls short of its palpable objective. Now its unfair to compare this film to \\"Citizen Kane\\", agruably one of the finest films ever made, but it is essentially the same theme. Gatsby, is also Kane, in his own way, from the humblest of circumstances, destroyed by wealth (as the script of \\"Kane\\" reads (sic): \\"You know, if I hadn't have had wealth, then I might have been a really great man\\".Indeed, Kane's wealth and power will not get him back to \\"Rosebud\\", or in Gatsby's case, \\"Daisy\\". However, does Dicaprio really have the swagger of Orson Welles? Does he exhibit the similar defiant charm? I think he is a great actor with terrific presence, maybe one of the best actors of a generation. Think of him in \\"The Departed\\". But, in this role, Leo sadly falls short, really flailing about as to whether the character should display arrogant charm or a devoted and sad sensitivity. And, Mulligan as \\"Daisy\\" is a disaster. She is a lovely \\"dishrag\\", completely devoid of any of the characteristics that would inspire such devotion and enduring love in Gatsby. I really want her to drink a few expressos. Finally, the entire opening sequence of parties, meant to set the stage for a \\"Jazz Age\\" is completely coarse, glaring, and \\"in your face\\" to the point where you want to turn the movie off. Perhaps, this is, the producers thought, the only kind of \\"bling\\" that would lure a modern, jaded crowd to the viewing of one of the greatest classics of literature, written both sparely, with the plainest kind of sincerity, and a vision of horror and tragedy engendered by a driven search for wealth that is, really, only a search for self. This is a small novel, but filled with great meaning and powerful images/symbols. If only someone could make a version that was also simple, small, and seriously engaging, show-casing the great depth of its characters. It is a difficult novel to transform into film, but this version, sadly, only scratches the surface.

B006I1OB0U|5.0|Downton Abbey is hands down my absolute favorite show.  I began watching it a few weeks prior to last season as I purchased the Blu-rays to catch up before watching season 3.  My entire family (including my husband) is hooked as well as a result!

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is a page turned, loved the whole series. The whole series is avaible now. I went crazy waiting for all the books to come out. Worth the time to read, although you won't be able to stop once you get started. Or at least I didn't. ;)

B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|I enjoy sci-fi, but I'm not well versed in the Star Trek universe, so no sentimental bias here.<br /><br />You don't have to know a lot about the Star Trek story-line to follow the plot of this movie.  The story arcs were very simplistic and it could have been condensed into a single TV episode.  The characters weren't compelling enough for me to care about the action scenes, which were pretty predictable.  The only character arc I did find interesting was Spock's, while Kirk was just sort of pudge-ing around in cliche after cliche.  The way they dealt with the villain was pretty silly, and obviously full of logical errors in order to move to the next action scene.  I also thought the villain sounded less than sinister in his evil speech moments, which was humorous to me.<br /><br />Anyway, I enjoyed seeing the glee of my die-hard trekky friend who took me to see this with him, but you can pass this by without feeling you missed out on anything.
B007MAETA8|1.0|I was so disappointed in this album.  I am no longer a huge John Mayer fan.  Every song on this album made me feel down. Besides purchasing Born and Raised I also purchased Paradise Valley and was very disappointed in that album as well.  All the songs on both albums have a country sound to them.  If you like country genre music, you will like these albums.  I happen to like rock and roll.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|This film is just simple enough to be predictable at times, but the sense of adventure is sustained.  It is well written and well acted enough to be compelling.  I hesitated to watch this now that we know how crazy Tom Cruise is, but he's still a good fit for a role like this.  (I would like to think this film might become an allegory for his personal disillusionment regarding the church of Scientology, his struggle against himself, and ultimate renouncement of the crazy).  A lot of the fun of sci-fi is in the gadgets, and here they do not disappoint.  Those drones are actually scary, and their domicile is like a preview of the iHouse (they live in an iPad, haha).<br /><br />I would have liked to see more exploration of the human element, but there wouldn't have been a lot of room for that in what's basically a \\"what-if-our-stuff-was-stolen\\" on a grand scale tale.  Bottom line, it's fun, and I would watch it again.

B00DU74U74|1.0|I commend the marketing team for doing an excellent job of fooling me with that exciting trailer - I had no idea this would be more teenage angst in space than slick sci-fi action.  I suppose I should have known better, given the source material's author, but I always like a good rebel sub-class vs. the larger social order story; too bad they hardly ever leave the hideout.  I thought maybe the lead character's search for individuality and self-worth would be compelling, but more time was spent on deciding which boy she likes kissing more.  And so the themes of a lead character devoid of character, trying to sort out her romantic options, repeat themselves in this film that may as well be called \\"Twilight in Space.\\"

B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was my first Liane Moriarty book and I quite enjoyed it. The three main characters were all distinct and well-drawn, and though the choices some of them made were difficult, Moriarty established a foundation for those decisions that made sense. Recommend.

B00640UICA|5.0|When I load a new app I test it myself before letting my children play with it. I was happy to see no advertisements, one of the first things I look for in an app for my 3 and 5 year old children. I like that once a level is complete and the next level is unlocked, one can go back and play the prior levels. I had planned to set up the app for my child to start from the first screen but my daughter asked if she could play with my phone one day and set herself into the app from several levels in and figured out how to play and how to finish the games tasks with no direction from myself or directions from the app. She enjoyed bringing smiles to the faces of the characters in the app as she helped them join hands. I love that the color of the character changes along with it's facial expression to tell you if it is still looking for a friend to hold it's hands. We love puzzle games and it is a welcome app that brings cheer with minimal stress. Great app!

B008B3MZNI|5.0|The film footage is enjoyable, and quite good. Some shots are a bit grainy looking, but who cares.<br />The performances and sound quality is really outstanding. Man, what a good band! It's cool to see Roger Hodgson playing electric guitar, I've really only seen him at the keyboard or playing acoustic. I only wish there were more shots of the drummer Bob Siebenberg. There are some goofy graphics, and stock shots that pop up, like the whole ending of Crime of the Century is a long night shot of Paris. I can only assume something was wrong with the footage at that point, so they had to cut away. And you get hits like Goodbye Stranger, Child of Vision and Give A Little Bit, which are not on the Paris audio album. That might have been a performance decision by the band back in the day.<br />A great purchase overall.

B00D7JGL36|5.0|I heard a couple of cuts from this album on the radio, before it was released.  I am a big Buck Owens and Merle Haggard fan, so I knew this would be good.  Vince Gill sings all the songs, and Paul Franklin is an awesome musician who plays the steel guitar like no one else.  Some of the songs are not that well known (at least to me), which only made the album better.  I am only sorry there weren't more songs on the album.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I'd really give the book a 3.5 rating .  There's a lot of repetition of the basic facts on whic the author relies.  Also, there isn't much meat in those facts.  It provides an interesting story and would have been better if the footnotes were addressed in each chapter, rather then a separate section at the end of the book.
B00479SVBU|5.0|There are quite a few of these type of players out there but only this one in this price range has an AUX OUT. It blows away the radio reception sound wise if you have an aux in on your car radio/cd player. It even has a bass and treble control via the eAsy to use menus. The remote makes driving safe and lets you navigate through folders and songs as well as SD card and flash drive. It works flawlessly and is priced to GO !! 5 Stars here!!

B00C7BZYX8|5.0|Directed by James Ponsoldt (Smashed), The Spectacular Now stars Miles Teller as Sutter Keely, a popular high school student that recently broke up with his girlfriend, Cassidy (Brie Larson).  After a night of drinking, Sutter blacks out and eventually wakes up on the front lawn of a schoolmate's house, Aimee Finecky (Shailene Woodley).  Through sheer coincidence, he enjoys Aimee's company and enlists her help with his flailing school work.  However, Sutter is still dealing with his feelings for his former girlfriend, even though he continues to fall for and spend time with Aimee.  While his classmates are getting into college, Sutter struggles with his fears of the future as he works at his job, blows off vital schoolwork, and constantly drinks - so much so that he starts to question his choices and place in the world.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Kyle Chandler, and Jennifer Jason Leigh also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />The Spectacular Now, based on the novel of the same name (written by Tim Tharp), is perfectly described by its title - spectacular.  There are very few coming-of-age films that focus on the serious tone of teen adolescence, young love, and dealing with difficult choices in regards to the future.  This particular story clearly has its finger directly on the pulse of the new generation and is full of smart, quick-witted dialogue.  The tale of Sutter Keely follows a true, honest course, sending the film in an emotionally fulfilling and sincere direction, which is a direction most generic young adult films completely avoid.  Naturally, there have been recent teen flicks that carry a heavy tone, but The Spectacular Now just does it better, having a similar feel films, like The Breakfast Club or The Perks of Being a Wallflower.<br /><br />In the majority of teen films these days, filmmakers are usually so focused on partying, sex, and comic relief (ex. American Pie, Project X, The To Do List, etc.) that they never bother to add any heart to their stories.  Initially, The Spectacular Now's story appears to be focused on teens falling in love, but it quickly becomes evident that the message of this film is so much stronger than a clich&eacute;d, one-dimension love story.  Teens are usually depicted as casual, happy-go-lucky kids that can expect to get the girl/boy, ignore consequences, and just wait for a happy ending.  However, this film portrays teens in a serious light, focusing on how one single person has the ability to impact or change another person's life.  Better yet, it spotlights the real life choices young people are forced to make and how these choices can have dire consequences.<br /><br />Miles Teller, a young actor known for playing the role of the typical teen party animal (as seen in his roles in Project X and 21 & Over), really steps into this dramatic role quite nicely.  Compared to his previous roles, it was a bit of a stretch for him to pull off this emotionally uncertain, borderline alcoholic character.  Teller's charisma is truly intoxicating and mesmerizing, giving him endless potential for future roles and making him easily comparable to well-known actor Shia LaBeouf.  Teller's co-star, Shailene Woodley, is also a relatively unfamiliar face to the big screen - most well-known for her role in The Descendants or possibly even for being cast as Mary Jane Watson in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (only to be cut from the film after she finished filming her scenes).  Regardless, she's a rising star and it's very evident in her role as Aimee Finecky.  Even though Woodley is not as charismatic as Teller, she still provides a handful of screen-stealing scenes - most notably of which comes during a heated exchange in a car with co-star Teller.  As far as the rest of the cast goes - it's impossible not to mention Kyle Chandler's appearance as a deadbeat dad, which is ironic since it's the complete opposite of the character he previously played for five seasons on TV's Friday Night Lights.<br /><br />Overall, The Spectacular Now features a plot and cast that exudes potential and excitement. There's no denying the sheer genius in the film's writing and direction - indicating director James Ponsoldt might also have a potentially fruitful career on the horizon.  This film deals with relatable themes involving the difficulties teens face while balancing the stresses of school, relationships, and family life.  Even more notable is the underlying theme depicting the possibly devastating effect alcohol can have on self-esteem and the decision-making process.  And, while teen films typically end in the same predictable manner, this story stays true to its roots, creating a purely pragmatic story from beginning to end.  It might not have the most desirable ending, but it is the most logical ending.  Collectively, this coming-of-age drama is an absolute breath of fresh air and is highly recommended.<br /><br />GRADE:  A<br />FNDNreview.come Spectacular Now features a plot and cast that exudes potential and excitement.

B000V5Y1SQ|4.0|When it first came on, I was not really impressed, but, like Star Trek The Next Generation, it started off slow. It took a while to learn the characters, and for the actors to learn them. By the end of the second season I really loved the show. The first season is a must watch, however, to learn the characters and the story line. Things happen in season one which help to develop the characters.<br /><br />Now, having seen the entire series, going back to watch this season was much more enjoyable. I knew who I was watching and understood where the episodes were going. I would probably rate it 5 stars for myself, but, if you are considering watching this for the first time, I think you'll find it doesn't rate that high.<br /><br />It is worth watching.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|WHAT IS THIS SORCERY ?!  :-)  Mind-blown that one can just write in your numbers and symbols and the app auto-magically converts it to proper &#34;entered&#34; data and then does the math, giving you the answer in the process.  Fun stuff!  Actually makes math fun lol
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Its great and a wide variety of songs. The band and the sound sounds awesome in my car! It even has a little base that comes through the speakers and my husband likes that!
B00B19G01C|3.0|This is also another take my review with a large dose of salt. I do recommend this one but more if you're looking for a decent horror movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie but at times it was hard for me to keep focus. I have definitely seen scarier movies, however there are definitely some very creepy scenes. I think the actress playing Emily did a very good job, as did Jeffery Dean Morgan. Kyra Sedgwick did okay but I am willing to give her performance to bad writing than just her. The overall concept is super interesting and the real life story that this is based on is super fun to read. If you're not interested in watching this movie, I do recommend you check out these links:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The pacing in this movie is okay and I think the movie's biggest fault is the writing. It is creepy at times but I never really felt scared during the movie (however if you have Mottephobia you might find this movie very scary). Once again this was decent and if you like a scary/suspenseful movie every now and again you'll probably like this one. There are better movies out there but at the end of the movie I don't feel my money was wasted and I was entertained.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for my iphone 4s. I looked for so long and was very disappointed that most of the cases out there are hard case and very uncomfortable to hold and slippery. This quality is excellent. It is made out of a white silicone that has a comfortable grip when held in hand and stays on the phone. It doesn't stretch out. Looks great with my white phone and the price couldn't be beat!
B002HSSAY6|5.0|Even if you don't like Westerns, you should watch this movie (you can kill me later if you don't like it). After watching a lot of blah movies this summer (2013), I have finally realized what was missing after watching this movie. Story depth. This movie has more depth in the first 15 minutes than the majority of films that came out this summer. Sergio Leone crafted something amazing with this movie, from the camera work to the set pieces to the action and intensity. One thing that might annoy people is Sergio Leone worked on a form of silent communication between characters which I think works very, very well. This technique does involve quite a bit of eye action but the focus and the acting really stand out with what was being attempted. There is more Shakespeare in the non-speaking between characters in this movie than all of the last movie I saw (Mortal Instruments: City of Bones).<br /><br />Let's talk about part of what makes this movie so special and why it has so much depth but first cinema history! Before this movie and others at the time, Westerns were more glamorized as forces between good and evil. Even if your hero was an outlaw, he was still a \\"good\\" guy. (On a side note something I find interesting is Westerns and Fantasy are actually very similar). It was often the good guy wore white or was in some way represented by white (white hat) and the bad guy would be all black or black hat (see, Fantasy again). In some ways, Cowboys were like the first superheroes a young generation identified with and then came the spaghetti westerns. Suddenly there were gray areas between black and white. The good guys were no longer paragons of virtue and the bad guys weren't so easily defined. It was a different type of Western and one that brought more thought into actual storytelling. This and Fistful of Dollars are to westerns like Watchmen is to comics.<br /><br />Great so now that I have a little hyperbole out of the way let me go on into this movie specifically (and more hyperbole). When there is talk about shades of gray I think people misinterpret what is being said. Gray is after all a boring color and hard to get variety if everything is shades of gray (there must be more than 50 right?) What it is really talking about in my opinion is character motivation. We hear all the time about how characters should be 3D and not cardboard cutouts but have we thought about what that really means? Obviously it means characters should have a past but it's not just a past. It is series of life choices that lead them to that moment we are first introduced to them. There is still more though than that, it is how the consequences of past actions determines future choices and a character's primal motivation. The very thing that makes them tick and this movie demonstrates it on every character at every level. The characters drive the story and it suddenly stops becoming a simple fairy tale but something more real and emotional. Before people were just painting in black and white with stories but now there is something new added and it isn't gray, it is color. There is so much more range in what is being told.<br /><br />Okay so you can tell I thought the characters were amazing but the story they tell in this movie is equally amazing. Right, so back to the beginning. The movie starts out with a mystery in what is happening and starts to deliver several different threads, slowly it all starts to weave together and come to a very satisfying conclusion. The story pacing is really something else and you can tell a lot of effort went into crafting this story. Charles Bronson delivers an outstanding performance a delivers some of the best one liners in any movie (sorry Arnold but Bronson really beat you on this one). Then you have the introduction of Frank played by Henry Fonda. This was quite a different role than what I am used to seeing Henry Fonda play and wow did he do an amazing job. This role is somewhat like Heath Ledger's Joker except Ifound Frank a bit more chilling. (Seriously, Frank and the Joker would be a scary combo). Then you have Cheyenne who ended up being my favorite character.... Well tied for favorite (okay so I am susceptible to eye candy, leave me alone). Jason Robards was simply put amazing, clever and really brought a different type of charisma to the movie. He is one of those there is method to his madness characters and always says something surprising. Then we have the lone female in the movie played by Claudia Cardinale. Who? Yeah I hadn't heard of her either but her character was very interesting (and guys... she is very pretty) because she wasn't quite the damsel in distress. She used what she knew and worked with people in ways that stayed true to her character in trying to accomplish what she wanted.<br /><br />I hate to leave this for last and I almost forgot to mention this but the music in this movie is amazing. Ennio Morricone did an amazing job that is almost unparalleled in modern movies. It adds so much to the atmosphere and mood of what is being presented on screen but at the same time Sergio Leone also knew when to use silence very effectively. The movie uses sounds in such an incredible way. It really makes the movie over the top on my recommendation list.<br /><br />In my opinion if you're even remotely interested in storytelling you should watch this movie. If you like westerns then chances are you have seen this movie already and are saying to yourself, \\"Wow, GE is slow on the uptake here.\\" If you haven't seen it though, make time to see it. If you like adventure movies and action movies see this movie. If you recall I trashed The Lone Ranger and then watching this movie I thought it was so funny that they both share quite a few similarities but this movie is how to do it right. If you don't like older movies you should suck it up and watch this anyway. (At the end of the day if you don't like this movie, feel free to hurt me.)<br /><br />This is on the Green Embers' Recommended List!found Frank a bit more chilling.

I mean come one we all know Liam Neeson is a god in human clothing just look as some of the roles he played.

B00499QUK2|5.0|Incredible show, story line, plot, acting and directing. The worst part is that there are only 3 episodes per year, but that is understandable as each episode is like a movie itself.

1609419693|4.0|Tina Fey's audiobook version of her memoir \\"Bossypants\\" is perfect listening for that late-night part of the road trip home when you are talked out, tired and starting to panic about everything that needs to be done before you go back to work.  Because Tina Fey reads the audiobook herself you are getting \\"stand-up\\" as well as a memoir.  Nobody can read her own work like Tina can! All that anxiety you're feeling will just evaporate as you are absorbed into Tina's chaotic world of romantic rejections, fast-tracking up the comedy ladder (the ultimate revenge when you've been passed over in love)and settling into super-momdom while multi-tasking comic stardom.<br /><br />Tina's brilliant spoof of Sarah Pallin launched her career.  There are those of us who really don't watch much TV so we thought that she was just another wonderkinde-- turns out she had the same depressing complex of frustrating-disappointing-embarrassing-confusing-heartbreaking adolescent experiences that most of us have had.  But instead of just settling for the life-long job at the YMCA and summer stock, Tina continued--intelligent and undaunted-- to the successful funny-girl, staff writer, manager-of-stars status that she continues to enjoy today as a relatively 'young' writer of a memoir...<br /><br />You'll laugh, gaffaw, snort, maybe even cry a little as Tina shares her life experiences with no sparing of self-depracating, intensely intimate humour that we can all relate to from our own lives.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Best reco I have ever had. Such a fantastic book. No one ever could be disappointed. Its just perfect. Buy it!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I like and hate this story it has taken me months to finish it and I only finished because I paid for it.  The story is very slow but interesting.  I also feel like the characters are pretentious.  They are magical beings and so much better than humans I know that is a lot in this category, I just have enough of this in my real life.  Sorry about the story it was interesting but slow I have to say that I would have liked this as a movie better than a book.  Not many books like that for me but I was constantly able to break away and read another book or just not read it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Excellent movie. Great action scenes. Can't wait for the sequel later this year. Music was exciting and created an air of anticipation
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My little My Little Pony fan loves it!  Great game with a lot of little games within it.  Fun for kids.
B007SGM084|5.0|The book is great. And give more in formation  on day to day live . Thankyou  for make my nigh  great.
B007Z58RLC|1.0|Poorly written, or translated rather. Mindless, mind-numbing, boring, lacking plot and containing a weak message. Not even culturally or religiously enlightening in the least. Don't read this book to learn about Hinduism, Buddhism or Indian culture because you'll be quite disappointed.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|Don't get your feelings hurt! Remember it's satire and it's rated R for a reason. Very offensive but very entertaining
1400069742|3.0|Slow on the uptake and overly detailed in the beginning. Nevertheless a very important lesson relevant to the US foreign policy today. Unfortunately, the isolationists have returned to our long term detriment.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Good graphics. Can pick up and put down easily. Lots of fun. Good app to waste some time with. Easy to play
B002VWNIAY|5.0|Good movie...we bought it for an Uncle of ours who had been wanting to finish watching it, he finally finished it all.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love Masterpiece Theater movies, and this one was no exception.  The actors are very good and it is interesting to see the period clothing and life.  You feel you get to know the fictional characters.
140006922X|4.0|More facts than you can ever believe in about one of the many patriots who has more impact in present times as he did then.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|I liked the old missile defender. this one has a lot more to keep up with and believe me it gets harder as you play. real fun and will keep you coming back for more.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Unlike a lot of books that are 300 pages of fluff, this one you can burn through in a good hour; every page is packed with info that was entirely useful.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|The predictions and style are perfect for my lifestyle. Also, I love the different colors. I can never go back to the standard keypad.
B009TO99TG|2.0|Never been a big Cold Play fan.  Been hearing songs in TV shows and other media that caught my attention.  Unfortunately Cold Play is one of those bands that most of their songs are indistinguishable from one another.  I have yet to make it through all 4 cds, I've tried but after a few songs I find myself wishing I was listening to something else
B00002DE4E|5.0|I already have all the music I can get a hold of from Joy Division. I also have books, documentaries and movies about them. In the 80's when I first heard Love Will Tear Us Apart i was hooked and wanted more but by the time it was released in the states Ian was already gone and there was no way to acquire any more music. I started collecting about 10 years ago and I'm so glad there has been renewed interest in the band and their influence on music. I will always be a fan.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I enjoyed some of the new characters introduced in this book & the further development of others. It did end abruptly, but I will move forward with the series. I would recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy, period pieces, & strong character development.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I purchased this album because I heard it on the radio.  I love it and play it a lot.  Zac Brown is wonderful
B000WZONL0|5.0|This movie was recommended to me by a co-worker. I had not heard of it until then which is a shame because this movie is a quiet masterpiece.<br /><br />The set designs and locations are excellent and reflect the period very well. Ioan Gruffudd, Romola Garai, Benedict Cumberbatch,  and Albert Finney all give sterling performances as William Wilberforce, his wife, William Pitt, the Younger and John Newton (the former captain of a slave ship who wrote the hymn Amazing Grace).<br /><br />Mr. Wilberforce worked for more than 20 years (along with many others) to get the Slave Trade outlawed in Britain. He had to work almost another 20 years after this movie to get Slavery completely abolished throughout the British Empire. Despite being ill with a severe auto immune disease, Wilberforce was the voice of the abolitionist movement in the House of Commons. He was the political face of a movement that would end slavery in Britain without a civil war.<br /><br />Ioan Gruffudd and Benedict Cumberbatch do an excellent job of portraying the life-long friendship that Wilberforce and Pitt shared. After I watched Amazing Grace, I read a great deal about Wilberforce and was pleased to see how well the movie stuck to the historical accounts of this man and his life.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something more than a car chase. I highly recommend this movie for older children. I think that seeing this could open a discussion with children about justice and morality and sheer perseverance in the face of adversity. If you love history, If you love costume drama, If you love a good love story, this is a movie you should see.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a fun and witty show. The characters are great and it's an intriguing story line. After the first episode I was hooked. I can't wait to see more.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|I broke my HB32 on my 18-105 in a car accident.  Bought this as a replacement and it fits and functions perfectly.  Of course this is expected as it is the OEM hood made by Nikon.  Great price on Amazon.com for it though.
0500516766|5.0|Cool idea and great photos.<br />Through this, we have great appreciation with the tools and gadgets we use these days.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|not a hard game but fun. better than most hidden object games. I liked the other games moreso than the hidden object parts. storyline is so-so but I don't play these for the storylines.
B009UAO1ZG|4.0|I liked it a lot, but I'm a historical fiction fan and it got quite detailed and thorough.  Some people may not like how wordy it was.
B00CBKXGPI|4.0|This game is very addictive. I hope once I purchase the full version, the art won't repeat as much. I like premise of the game a lot.
0307719774|5.0|Got this gift for one of my friends and she loved it; took it to college with her. The questions are pretty good and make you think. Recommend as a gift or for yourself if you want to see how your answers would change over the years.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Didn't want to put it down, read n 5 days while @work , a really good Grisham read, waiting for a time to kill sequel
1447231171|3.0|Not as good as the first two of this trilogy and disappointed in the ending...a set-up (won't add a spoiler here).
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|once I collect a prize. the next day it dissapers. please please please fix the bug for me. also make coin cheeper.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|Gilmour at his best. Great music from Floyd and David's solo music. The sound is good and Gilmour's solos are always worth listening to!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Downloaded the Kindle on my phone, my tablet, my ipod and my laptop! Love being able to read where ever I want!
B000ELJBAK|5.0|Very good music. Even away from Pink Floyd David's guitar playing is still very expressive. It's worth listening to just for that, even when he covers someone elses music.
B000I9WW0E|5.0|Great cast, amazing direction and writing, unforgettable characters, and just a bizarrely and thoroughly entertaining movie. A cult classic for good reason.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I was lucky enough to see the premier midnight movie of this at Sundance Film Festival in January 2013.  Then I was browsing for a movie the other night and streamed it to my laptop.
B00DYVESVO|5.0|I've been waiting to read this and it did not disappoint!! Great story I loved it!! I cannot wait to read the follow up story.
B009LGO88E|4.0|so I have been contemplating to get this or not for my 3ds for a long time, now that I have it I can at least help anyone who plans or contemplate to get it or not.<br /><br />So here's my thought on it.<br />- if you want to invest your time heavily in games like MH3 or resident evil or Zelda:OOT, GET IT!<br />it makes your gameplay much much more enjoyable. I can say playing 3ds without CCP for a long period of time<br />can cramp your hands. I played ps3 religiously, so this CCP is a good send for a system that has flat thin design like 3ds.<br /><br />- WARNING be careful though. If you don't have any plans investing some time on playing games above then don't bother..<br />this accessory DOES NOT work with games that don't support it (Luigi mansion, layton, etc) which makes it annoying since you want to add that extra bulkiness to get better grip for your 3ds (fits nicely with your hand/palm) even for other games,heck, ALL GAMES.<br /><br />another annoyance is once you put the CCP in place, you can't swap cartridge and pull your stylus easily, you have to open the CCP.
1577314808|5.0|Great stuff for a pathway to identifying the \\"ONE\\" within!! I Would highly recommend it for all who need spiritual leadership.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|How can you not love The Lorax?  Probably one of the top movies in our house!  Great for family movie nights.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Give us the game!!!! Why are you holding back? Most popular game and you give us a manual on how to play a game you don't have.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Enjoyable movie, shows the author is capable of growing beyond the vampire world,  with a good story and great performances. It's well worth the cost of rental...
B003RV43X4|5.0|As a geek that loves Greek mythology, I'm glad I can watch mostly any movie I want at a simple clip on amazon. Plus the movie was amazing!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|Lady Gaga is back with a thought provoking song about her love of her fans during her recovery of a broken hip.
B004MPI5SS|3.0|I gave it 3 stars because of the acting.  The girl was ok (for the most part) but the guys' hick accents were over the top.
B003L77V3S|5.0|To me, this is one of Churchill's best!!!  I would recommend reading this book first, it sets the stage for Churchill's later writings.
1781162646|5.0|Had read many of Stephen Kings book, this is one of my favorites. It's not all about scaring the reader to death.<br />It's a light summer read and not way over the top like too many current books.
0399226907|5.0|MY KIDS HAD THIS BOOK WHEN THEY WERE SMALL. THEY ENJOYED IT SO MUCH. IT WAS ONE OF THEIR FAVORITES. SO NOW I GOT IT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER AND SHE SEEMS TO LOVE IT TOO.
140006922X|5.0|For numbers of years now I've been making notes about Jesus and his life and death. Though I have a PhD in the humanities, I don't consider myself a Biblical scholar. But the more I learned about Jesus, the more it became clear to me thst the Romans killed Jesus twice. Once on the cross, and then a second time by making him a god. This second death allowed the Romans and those in their empire to rob Jesus of his humanity, his Jewishness, and to make of him an idealized figure, almost an idol. He became the literal son of God, much as Zeus had offspring, something out of character with the Hebraic scriptures, but very much in line with Greco-Roman tradition. In Zealot, Reza Aslan has gone a long way toward depicting Jesus the man, in the context of the time when he lived.  It was a time of zealotry, of resistance against Rome, of messiahs who challenged the world's most powerful military power with nothing more than their belief in divine justice. Aslan tells this story in a compelling way, drawing on a range of historical sources, including the gospels, which he finds at times contradictory. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about the real Jesus and his brother James, heroes who stood up to the authoritarian powers of the day, and paid with the price of their lives.
B000L53D4O|5.0|MY GRAND BABY HAS LEARNED WITH IT AND IS ENTERTAINED FOR A WHILE. HELPED HIM WALK SO THAT ALONE IS A PLUS
B0081336FO|5.0|Three episodes was not enough.  Episodes 1 and 3 were brilliant and breathtaking.  Episode 2 only seems drab in comparison to the former and later episodes but excellent when compared with the majority of even good shows on television now days.  If you've watched Season 1 this one won't disappoint!
1419705849|4.0|THIS I PURCHASED IT FOR MY NIECE. SHE HAS ENJOYED READING THEM SO I GUESS THEY ARE GOOD. IT IS GOOD TO ENFORCE OUR KIDS TO READ.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story. The main character showed a lot courage and she made the best of her different situations. It was a very enjoyable read and I was glad to learn about an actual 'Orphan Train' and find out how some of the real life orphans got on with their lives.
1419707671|4.0|IF YOU BUY THEM SINGLE IT CAN BE PRETTY EXPENSIVE. I GOT A GREAT DEAL WITH THIS BUNDLE. PLUS I GOT TO GIVE THEM AS A WHOLE PACKAGE FOR A YOUNGSTER TO READ AND THAT IS WORTH IT.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Each chapter presents the experiences of different survivors and their experiences as they happened throughout the world, from the genesis of the virus to the rebuilding of a new world. This is the first book I recommend for lovers of the zombie genre.
1419707663|4.0|I HAD LOOKED FOR THESE ELSEWHERE AND THEY WERE PRETTY EXPENSIVE BUYING THEM SINGLE. I GOT A GREAT DEAL WITH THIS BUNDLE.
B00BFBBN3G|5.0|this is an awesome dvd story! i think it may be a bit much for some kids to understand but it is very touching !
B00422LESO|5.0|Great story telling...especially if you love the Austen books! Humor, romance and twists in the plot...wouldn't it be great if there was such a place?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Wife loves the show....  she would give it 10 stars if possible...  she has watched all 3 seasons and is looking forward to season 4
B005HED11Y|5.0|Felt nice to watch the original episodes of Star trek which I had watched a kid.....Very nice...Enjoyed to the fullest....
B007THA4FI|3.0|It was really hard to want to get to know any of the characters. I found them all mean spirited, small minded and nasty. Not at all what I want to believe about bucolic small towns where neighbors are kind, thoughtful, and helpful to one another.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|My Favorite movie of the Bourne series (so far). Can't wait for the next one. While I was waiting for the DVD\Blue-Ray to arrive, I was able to watch the digital copy.
B0063M22QO|4.0|App works well, all tiles are clear and easily seen. Enjoy my time playing it. Would recommend this game to anyone interested.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Its a fun game, a great way to waste some time. I am digging it quite a bit. And as a free app of the day, it was a bargain!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son downloaded this game on his iPod and as soon as I tried it I had to get it on my kindle! It's a lot of fun and gets more and more challenging the further you go. The only thing I have trouble with is finding the secret locations. Apparently there's a bunch but I've only found two. Very addicting game, for good reason! Love it!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|My 14 yr old daughter loves Doctor WHo and she thought this sonic screwdriver was the best! Made from decent plastic, but I wouldnt recommend as a toy for young ones, it does have small parts. It really does light up and she was thrilled, so IM happy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took FOREVER for this book to pick up and then BAM!! it was done.  I did not like this book.
B00915G6MG|5.0|Come on people! Everybody loves this show! Their personalities click just right! I do not know how the writers keep coming up with new ideas but their good!
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I do like this app, don't like being told to give a good rating in order to get updates, would have given a good rating anyway :)
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Loved not knowing until the end how it was all going to turn out. Mystical but not overboard. Kept you guessing until the end.
B00BWJ91XK|4.0|Got me to think whats next loved it,dragon wakes up then  it just ends there. Awesome flick cant wait to see what else happens.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|This song has long been waited for from the Lady and as she said she wrote 70 songs for this next album and this was the first of many. On the VMT's she said it was her first entrance to electronic music. If this doesn't get yo up on the floor nothing will. Just wait to you here the applause applause...
B00A8OWOSO|5.0|For dialogue, you can not find hardly a better film and it is one of my favorite films.  Few films I watch more than once.  Miller's Crossing I never tire of.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|I enjoyed it. I tried not to be too anal. Of course I love the original. There are great parts and cheap parts but it was a decent flik. Fun to watch
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This cute device is capable of displaying Netflix and YouTube videos. That's it. So do most contemporary TVs. Do yourself a favor add $10 and buy one of cheap M808  boxes. You'll get much more bang for the buck.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great writing - great acting!  We watched three seasons in three weekends. Quality entertainment from across the pond.  REcommend to anyone.
1451627297|1.0|This book was just a vehicle to vent his anti-American views. No wonder it won THE 2012 LOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZE.
B003Y5USF0|4.0|Loved this movie growing up, still love it now. My household knows every line to this movie and for good reason. A pinnacle of fun, awesomely bad, cinema.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It's great to be in the 21st century!  I just need more time to find how to use all the uses!
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This video is done to beautiful, serene music.  There is no talking.  The snowman appears to be magic, and the little boy is in awe of what happens to him when he and the snowman venture out, flying over the earth.  My grandson began watching it on VHS when he was three.  He is now nine and has never forgotten how much he loved it.  That is why I bought the DVD version so we can continue to enjoy it.  Even though it is not Christmas yet, we watched it when it arrived and fell in love with all over again.  I would highly recommend this to kids and people of all ages.  It just makes you kind of wish that things could be that calm once in a while!!
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|Danny DeVito and his wife Rhea made one great movie.<br />It is currently on Broadway in NYC as a play too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its really fun and addicting. It keeps me busy when im bored. LOVE THIs GAMEEEE!!!!! It is so worth the money!  Get this app. Dont wait get ot now and you will be happy you did!
B00BTYP6QE|1.0|I got Cut the Rope on Kindle Fire for my grandson. I reminded him to be careful not to order anything extra that might pop up in the game. I watched him as he rejected a pop up that would have cost money. I sent the Kindle home with him because he was sick and needed some quiet amusement. That same evening, I got 3 emails charging me for 3 new games. My grandson did not order them - he was being careful to follow my instructions about tricky pop ups. And as a matter of fact, the 3 new games never appeared on the Kindle. Two of the games were 3.99, and one was 2.99, and they showed on the bill with a picture of Cut the Rope next to them. I called Amazon, and they said that you need not only a password, which might not prevent purchases, but also parental controls, which I now have on my Kindle Fire. I don't blame my grandson - he was tricked by this game's setup, just as the manufacturers planned. It is low down and dirty dealing in my opinion to get monetary gain by tricking children with an innocent- seeming game. So only 1 star from me for Cut the Rope.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Love this series, great acting and writing.  Never a dull moment, always looking forward to the next episode. Recommend highly.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This series is everything they said it would be. Exciting, great acting, addictive! I just love this show to pieces.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|Love this series, great acting and writing.  Never a dull moment, always looking forward to the next episode. Recommend highly.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|OMG, this show gets better and better. We watch 2 or 3 episodes per night. Don't know how it could get any better.
B0054U56B4|5.0|Fair price pretty much brand new condition. Fast shipping. I haven't read it yet but I liked the movie and I love to read so I am sure the books are even better.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|You likely are here after hearing the song &#34;Royals&#34; on the radio, and finding you like the song wanted to find more. In that case, I would recommend this! I really enjoy the track &#34;Tennis Court.&#34; Check it out.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I loved this movie. It was funny, sad, and romantic all in one. It portrays the different types if pregnancy very well.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Another attempt to enjoy a book by Gillian Flynn. Not until I was nearly finished did I find myself thoroughly entertained. Not a big fan of her writing...more about the main character's feelings rather than a detailed or eventful story line. Not sure if I'll attempt book 3. I need a book that sucks me in and keeps me there.
B002R27J1W|5.0|Audrey Hepburn's last film before a long break, Wait Until Dark was filmed a year following How To Steal A Million. Also in this role, her sweetness, her beauty and a very good script make this thriller a film to watch over and over again. Highly recommended.
B00DHHFKE4|4.0|I bought it becouse i was watching the series and i guess its pretty cool the book doesnt stick that hard to the series at all Wich makes it a much less exiting and dramatic or fun read, but hey thats just me and i havent even read half of it so Cheers!!
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I was very pleased with this movie. Such a fun movie! I liked the video game jumping theme. Was cool to see how they incorporated all the games to make a this movie.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|I am not a HUGE BOC fan, but have been listening to them for a few years before this album came out. I believe this is the easiest of their albums to listen to all the way through, even if it's not the most accessible. With their other albums, I find myself skipping songs. This one has a constant mood throughout that translates so well as an album. Favorite tracks: Jacquard Causeway (hypnotizes me every time), Split Your Infinities, and Sick Times.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Hands down best apple accessory I have ever purchased. Now you can load pictures directly easiest thing ever to use!
B00005N6KG|4.0|This thing is pretty damn flexible! Really light, sound audio is good enough, all I need is music on my run, no popping noise, took me a while to figure out exactly how I should put this on my head. Only one problem though. When extended, this little thing can really pull some hairs now and then.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You will do all three and more while reading this uplifting and tragic story. I hestitated to read this novel because the premise sounded like such a downer. Was I ever wrong. I laughed more while reading this book than others advertised as comedy. Don't miss this one!
B001PTG4BO|5.0|The long tail is a short read but a must read if the digital world is your dance floor period!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This is Tarantino at his best. You get exactly what you expect - and so much more. There's the action, blood & guts, a little love mixed in, lots of violence, and of course the classic Tarantino humor. I was hesitant at first because it seemed a little dark, but man-oh-man it was SOOO worth it. I'm actually going to have to purchase this one because it's one you need. The story was excellent, the acting was phenomenal,etc, etc, etc. I can't speak highly enough of this. If you can stomach Tarantino, then you'll love Django Unchained.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I've got a kindle. Prefer this over website. Highly recommend it. Easy to use. Great for using while still not logged in
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the characters, the plots and the actors who populate this awesome show!  Maggie Smith is one of my favorites.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Good story, good acting...as a member of the US Intelligence Community...the show does a good job of being accurate without embellishment.
B001KT6JPA|5.0|I love the story of Hannibal Lector. This book was an awesome read even the second time around. I just wish the movie was true to the story. I love bed how the book ended, which gave possibilities for another sequel. Still waiting Mr Harris!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Surprisingly really good!  I thought I wouldn't like it.  Julianna Margolies is terrific. I'm Making my way through more seasons.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Am so hooked on this series it's not even funny! This writer just has a way with words. Am really enjoying. Excellent
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As a final chapter in the series -The Hunger Games, it was both devastating and happy. The book shows the hearts and souls of people who are fighting for freedom, and how there is no good vs evil in the real world. They are just people vs people, each side had wrong doings and the rebellion was necessary. It shows that every step you take has a cause and effect, and the only thing you should truly fight for is yourself. My favorite part is the balance that is shown between two people in love, in the quote, &#34;I have plenty of fire myself, what I need is the dandelion in the spring. The bright yellow that means rebirth instead of destruction. The promise that life goes on, no matter how bad our losses. That it can be good again.&#34;
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show no bad language no nudity refreshing have watched all seasons at least twice so far probably watch them again before the new season
B001XUPH9K|1.0|I heard it wasn't a good one.  They were right!  It was boring and stopped it after about 10 minutes.
B000YAA68W|5.0|I first saw this film in my Anthropology course regarding Middle Eastern Women. I never get tired of it! Fantastic film.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Wonder! That a story has heart should be understood by all readers. What a delicious gift to find one that has a soul as well. Thank you!
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Can not seem to find a reset button.  Maybe I have to lose everything to reset the game back to level 1.
0470913029|4.0|I remember the Stillman diet from years ago that was available in a pocket size book  It got right to the point without pages and pages of theory.  They need to take out half the pages of explanation.  In fact, all diet books should.  Most of us that diet are always looking for the newest program. Like prior diets: been there, done that.  Is all this CYA necessary.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Such a fun and exciting book to read.  Simply loved it. It really does work...Pam makes it practical and easy to follow.  Thank you Pam for your brilliance and sharing your gifts.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is a definite personal taste in music.  Wanted to hear my favorite sing other music than his own.  I wasn't disappointed.
0425263908|3.0|Not a bad author.<br />However, this story was way too much of a rip-off of ELJames Fifty Shades of Grey.<br />Too much narration, not enough dialog.<br />I'm glad I read it however.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|These guys have great products.  If you are a Mac technician, this toolkit is PERFECT.  It's small and has all of the weird screw drivers you need.  I've purchased a ton from them, had a problem with one item I bought on Amazon and they worked with me directly and got me the replacement within a few days.  Awesome customer service!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game, it's so much fun. It's just like the actual card game, and can play anytime and anywhere.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved it ( along with Series 1 & 2 ).  This series is worth the Prime membership price.  What a bonus from Amazon!
0920668372|5.0|I buy this for every new mom I know, it has to be one of the sweetest (tear inducing) stories ever.  Beautiful and yet kid friendly with kid friendly illustrations-- it makes for a wonderful bedtime story.
0553801473|2.0|This copy was a misprint.  The book had 30 pages that were missing and 30 pages that were printed twice.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Can't get tired of it... Love it, all the time!<br />Oh... and the kids loved it too! LOL<br />We recommend!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Fast and simple, with nothing you don't need and exactly what you do. Nothing more to say,  but amazon requires me to keep writing peans of praise.
B00DM12ANO|4.0|I thought about how the first matrix movie made you rethink life while I watched this show. If you liked the matrix you will like this show.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Ordered this in Google Play and Amazon about a month ago. Received it few days ago from Google.<br /><br />Took 30 seconds to setup with my home theater receiver (Onkyo). Plug into an open HDMI input port.<br /><br />Was able to cast movies from macbook pro and Samsung S4 immediately. Video was great, Audio worked as per HDMI passthrough setting.<br /><br />All in all it was easy to setup, works really well...<br /><br />Things that work really well are (but not limited to).. Anything in Chrome browser including online movie channels, Youtube, Picassa Web, ...
B002K0WBYG|3.0|I don't know why, but I thought this came with a DVD copy also. It was my mistake.<br /><br />I love the movie!!<br /><br />It arrived quickly, and in great shape.
B003U6BE8I|1.0|Movie might be good, no idea, there was no warning that the App on I-tunes is not compatible with Apple TV
B0070UFMOW|5.0|very nifty device in a small package.  i checked the serial and it was indeed an authentic product.  it comes with a small felt case and some screen protectors, an optical and RCA adapter spdif adapter as well.  it was immediately recognized on my windows 8 computer and i have also been able to get it to work well with my rooted 2012 nexus 7 using cm10.1 and leankernel
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This guide was clear, concise and very easy to use. If you've never &#34;built&#34; a book to publish on Amazon, you be glad to have it on hand.
B007YNBOJM|5.0|I've been wanting a pair of these for a while and they have been wonderful so far. My only concern is how short they run on four batteries, but it's something that detects brain activity so you can't expect it not to need large amounts of power.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved in until the end. I was so very disappointed in the ending but the book kept my attention all the wat
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|I thought this was offensive for the repeated derogatory language. Having said that it is average in rating knowing it was Mr Tarantino's movie. The best scene was where Jim Croche's \\"I Got a Name\\" was dubbed in.
B005HP2J66|5.0|Werner Hertzog has made some great movies over the years.  This may be the best yet.<br />Fitzcaraldo was another.  He obviously loved the Amazon.
B00594XOZU|4.0|I tried to login on my kindle and it tells me that login failed... but why? I had a very strong internet Connection and it didn't help.
B00A81MV3U|4.0|The guy who got this was happy to receive it. He liked this movie a lot and said it was one of his favorites. So, now he has it in his movie collection.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is so addictive! Absolutely worth getting. I feel like my life depends on protecting those buildings. Five stars for missile defender!
B008L5G4I8|4.0|Four stars is a good rating for this book.  For Christie`s first book I would highly recommend this for a first time Christie reader.  It is always refreshing to have more well written story rather than sex scenes and swearing to fill in for poor writing and lack of story line.  All Agatha Christie books are worth reading.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It was okay lost interest in about half way through reading.  Took me a few extra weeks to pick it back up and start reading again
098478280X|5.0|This book is very nice and useful.<br />I strongly recommend that all the students in computer science should read it before getting a job.
B00EDF43MY|4.0|Dr. Panda's airport is a lot of fun. It has plenty to do; more than most of the Dr. Panda games. It is more challenging; since you have to dial phone number's and play a game similar to I Spy; which can be difficult for some kids. Overall; great app; lots to do; pretty fun.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I'm not a Noah Wylie fan and he carries a lot of this. It starts slowly as a very clich&eacute;d post apocalyptic vision in which people are more dangerous to each other than the alien enemy is, but the character arcs are good and by the end of the series I was sorry to see it finish.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The investments should also regenerate. You can make money with out taking out the progression of the game. I think that people would have more fun or does anybody care.<br />.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I first heard about Diana Krall on Sirius XM on the Sinatra station.  I thought she was great!  She has such a mellow, soulful voice.  So relaxing.  This album is fantastic!  I'm very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend it!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Good graphics something me and my wife play together and pass time little hard to build up resources and coins
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My granddaughters loved the music CD first...now the movie.  Thanks for making it available for preorder.  Please keep it coming!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Collins has done it this time! L<br />Katniss Everdeen hold  on to dear life  in the first installment of fantastic trilogy!
B00DU73T08|4.0|It was well acted overall with an interesting plot and subplot.<br />If you are a scifi fan you should enjoy it.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Ive tried I think all the others and I've come back to accuweather,I've found none of the other weather sites allow you to track a storm as accurate .
B006LSZECO|5.0|So many unexpected twists and turns. I was exclaiming out loud as I read it. Find someone else who has read it so you can talk about it.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Loved it so!! Great cast and acting! The young actors were so good. The story is convincing and all together this movie is great. :)
B009GI8J1O|5.0|I warn you I watched the movie first. This was a mistake. The movie is a great adaptation but it loses the character of the book. The book is great because it is developed to be unfinished. I have said in conversations with friends \\"would we still think Harry Potter was a great series if Harry died at the end?\\" Or what if we read a book that just ended? Cloud Atlas finishes but leaves so much open. Having seen the movie I expected the book to be something it wasn't. I am glad it was much better than my expectations. It wove a better yarn. I wanted to know what happened next much more than the movie. It left me thinking about more than just the tie ins. The best books are the ones that make you think. Cloud Atlas will stimulate your curio and your imagination.
B003FSTN52|4.0|I just started watching this show on DVD, although I know it's been on the air for a while. The reason I finally picked it up was the cast - just an amazing ensemble with no weak links. Julianna Marguiles from ER, Chris Noth from Law and Order and Sex and the City, Josh Charles from Sports Night, Christine Baranski from Cybill and Big Bang Theory, Matt Czuchry from Gilmore Girls, Joe Morton from Eureka - the list goes on and on. I wasn't familiar with Archie Panjabi before now, but she's great, as well. And I'm only halfway through the first season. It almost doesn't even matter what the show is about with this kind of talent onboard, but you attract talent with good writing and challenging storylines, and the show delivers episode after episode. I'm hooked!
B002QE3CTY|3.0|Intriguing story, but a little frustrating in the on going lack of information.  It also seems like a bit of a racket that they make you buy multiple books, when really it was such a short easy read it easily could have been joined with the next book...That said, I enjoy dystopian society books, and the story itself piques my interest enough that I will continue reading.  It is a good Just for fun book, but will never make my list of favorites.
B004XQO90O|4.0|As a fan of shows like Fringe and Eureka, this movie was definitely in my wheelhouse. The technology that could make the bulk of the movie possible was at least plausible, and without giving away any spoilers, if they had ended it on the train, it would have been completely satisfying. Everything that followed was impossible, to the point where the film didn't even bother offering an explanation for how it could happen, which ruined the experience a bit, for me. But still largely entertaining and worth seeing.
B00CW7KK9K|2.0|I had been looking forward to this product since it was first announced.  When I received it, I was impressed with it's size and weight.  It was very easy to use and sync with my phone.  One thing I noticed was that the display was not as sharp as it was portrayed in the photos.  It's is just slightly blurry/diffused, but that didn't other me much. I wore it for 4 days, night and day, and I loved the information it was collecting.  During the day, I kept it in my pocket, without the clip, as the clip makes it bulky and you can't easily take your heat rate unless you pop it out.  On the 5th day I left it in my workout shorts.  I hopped in the shower and got dressed but I didn't notice that my partner grabbed my clothes and threw them in the washer.  A while later that day, I realized that i didn't have the tracker on me...<br /><br />I found it in the front load washer trap.  :(  I freaked out!<br /><br />I let it dry for several days and attempted to charge it and it will not turn on.  :(<br /><br />I am very disappointed.  $100 down the drain, and no activity tracker for me.<br /><br />I am fearful if I buy another one, that the same thing will happen again.  It is soo small and light that it can easily be missed.  I am thinking maybe a wristband tracker might be best for me.  This makes me very sad as I love my withings scale, and I really wanted to buy into this ecosystem.  I really wish this tracker was waterproof.  If a future version is waterproof, I may get one again.
B00B97SNJI|4.0|This is my first Dawes cd and I'm enjoying it a lot. I caught them on Letterman a few weeks ago, first doing then single form this cd, and then the next night backing up John Fogerty...I was sold after that.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|All of us that are married or that aspire to be have taken or will take that vow, but what does it mean? This movie gives a scenario of how that vow could play into effect...you'll have to watch it from here though! No spoilers! The last thing I will say is that is that there are some really good, well shot, artful and tasteful sex scenes; nothing like American Pie material. However if you have some sort of moral obligation or rule against pieces of erotic cinema photography: DO NOT WATCH IT. Otherwise, I know you'll enjoy this movie to it's full extent!
B004G6TD4S|4.0|This is one of my top 3 ELP cd's, and it just might be my number 1. It's recorded really well and contains some of my all time favorite ELP songs including, &#34;From The Beginning&#34; and 'Endless Enigma&#34;
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is a great game for when you only have a few minutes to play. Fast load up and clear visibility.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|Well acted and directed. The actors in unaccustomed roles doing them well. A favorite of ours and our kids too.
B009AMANH4|4.0|I liked the movie, love Daniel Day-Lewis, but I'm not sure I really needed to buy it.  These sort of movies always make you wonder just how much of it is &#34;a movie&#34; and how much of it is factual.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|The controlls are too hard to use on a Tablet of another device.  Not all games are made for these new devices.<br />20 year ago a game like this would have been great on a IBM Compatible Personal Computer but his is 2013.<br />They should really call this game &#34;Boring World&#34;.  I did not like the App, my Kid did not like the App we both thought that is was a waste of time, so I removed it from my device.  Sorry.
B004LWZW88|4.0|Liked it better that I expected I would.  The story is interesting enough to make it entertaining and to keep your interest.
B00EFB8UHU|5.0|I wish the whole world understood french because this man is a genius. Each song is different, extremely original. The techno/pop beats are amazing. But underneath his mastery of sounds, a musical genius is conveying messages about everything in the world through elaborate metaphors. Stromae, bravo! En tant que mere celibataire de culture mixte, je t'applaudis. Je trouve tes chansons extraordinaires. Elles me bouleversent presqu' aux larmes tout en me faisant danser (alors je danse :)).Chapeau!
B00BEZTMWW|4.0|I like the movie, as it naturally syncs up well with the previous trilogy.  I have not read the book, but the story does seem to repeat many of the same plot lines from the Lord of the Rings... basically another adventure across the countryside, being chased by everything and anything, and of course there are multiple very evil enemies to be deal with...where have we heard that before?
1577314808|5.0|From the first page, I was totally engrossed in how Tolle presented his understanding of the &#34;Now&#34;. It has had a tremendous impact upon my life.
B008MM9630|4.0|Great game for kids or adults I'd like to see more things to buy that don't use diamonds or make it easier to get diamonds
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great ideas, great acting, good story.  Walter by far is the coolest character in Season 1, looking forward to more development on the overall plot in following seasons.
B0024CEY36|5.0|I found this book to be a very engaging work of historical fiction.  It is interesting to note that for all that has been written about the events leading up to WWII, very little has been written about the events and treaties that dragged so many nations in to WWI.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Sweet and sassy. An original story. Great actors. I haven't like Bradley Cooper this much since he played Will Tippin in Alias.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|The movie was ok, but the book was better As it usually is. I will watch the next part when it comes out.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I like this game and others like it. This game is entertaining and didn't take to long to learn how it works. My only issue is it take way to many &quot;investments&quot; to unlock monuments or entertainments and that takes to much real money.
B00CNIDH7A|5.0|Great cd by a great band I really enjoyed the additional live content included on the cd.  A really good buy.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|I loved the story and the acting was superb! I would recommend this movie to anyone. Matthew McConaughey is great
1451695195|5.0|I found this book very good and would recommend it to anyone interested in our afterlife.  I will encourage others to read it.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|For those of us not quite there but seeing old age fast approaching, it is a delight to see this story told with candor,  respect and grace. But then I'll be pretty graceful too if I end up in such a beautiful &#34;home&#34; with such hip oldsters.
0670014893|4.0|With [[ASIN:0670014893 A Delicate Truth: A Novel]], John LeCarre returns to form and approaches late career highlights like [[ASIN:0743287207 The Constant Gardener: A Novel]], [[ASIN:B0046LUHNO The Mission Song]], and [[ASIN:0743458060 Single & Single]]. At 82 years old, we don't know how many more he has in him, but wish him a few more successes.<br /><br />An extraordinary rendition of a jihadi arms dealer is being planned to take place on the island of Gibraltar. The conspirators are an up and coming British Foreign Office Minister and an American private security contractor.<br /><br />Kit Probyn, a long time Foreign Office desk occupier who is playing out his string until he reaches retirement, is brought in to do his duty to Queen and country as the operation's cut-out.<br /><br />The operation is a success, Probyn is promoted and everything is \\"jolly good\\" but three years later it seems that all was not as was claimed. Sorry, no plot spoilers.<br /><br />A LeCarre book is never bad and while this may not be one of his great ones, it is just a notch below and well worth the read.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 5 year old was very excited to get this app to play.  She has thoroughly enjoyed it and plays it daily.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|One of the all-time great British comedys.  The remastered product is excellent with a clear picture and good sound.  Would certainly recommend to someone else.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a good summer read with some decent twists.  This was not literature but it definitely holds your attention.
B000YABYLA|5.0|so glad that my nephew made me watch this a few years ago Love Michael Cera and Ellen Page in this one they both make me laugh.  A classic lol
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can You Escape?<br />Challenging game.....perfect for those free moments between appointments.  Each level is different and forces you to think of different solutions.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wow! Great read! I plan to read a lot more nich sparks books! This is the type of relationship every woman wants with a man
B006S01GH2|5.0|excellent film, whimsical, comedic and somewhat mystical.<br />Audrey Tautou is wonderful as a young woman from a dysfunctional family who lives in a world of her own making.<br />This film left me feeling happy and hopeful.
B000002LCI|5.0|I wrote this same review for another CD (Music for the Masses) she also purchased:<br /><br />My wife purchased this CD and absolutely loves it.  We each have our favorite CD on the car changer and she enjoys hers so much, I am never the first to push the button when we get in.  I always have to wait to hear mine.
B005HED11Y|5.0|This is like watching mini TV versions of all the best philosophical and moralistic books in the world. Yes, the sets are rubbish, there's not enough naked girlies, and there are a too many implausible bits of technology, but an awesome 5 star.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|This movie opens with a ridiculous guns blazing scene, and proceeds to be a film with more bullets than minutes.<br /><br />And thats exactly what you should want with an Expendables movie. The cameo's are great, and Chuck Norris tells a Chuck Norris joke.<br /><br />If you're not looking for a action movie where the good guys don't necessarily reload, then you;re not looking for The Expendables 2.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|When my granddaughter selected this...she thought it was the candy crush game.  It is only the help guide.  Don't need it if you can get the game to load on a kindle.
B00E1LAS42|5.0|I highly recomend this video.  Dicaprio does such a great job, who new that with the reviews it recieved from the papers how good it actually is
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Not that good a movie, I stopped watching it in the middle.  Would not recommend it even if you are very bored.  Find something else.  Big pharma will hate this.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|highly recomend this video.  who new that with the reviews it recieved from the papers how good it actually is
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE AND WANTED IT IN MY LIBRARY.  I SAW THE MOVIE WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT. I LIKE ANY MOVIE WITH BOTH ACTORS IN . THE SHIPPING WAS VERY FAST, AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THE MOVIE TO ALL AND BUYING IT FROM THIS DEALER.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Once started one has to watch each season straight through. Great acting, beautiful costumes, beautiful scenery, fine script and story line.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Never played the other Dungeon Hunter games, but this one is awesome!  Best gfx and gameplay of all ny games on my kindle fire hd !
1582701709|5.0|I have given several copies of The Secret to others. I had to buy another one to replace my own. I keep it on my night stand along with the Daily Teachings. : )
B0052AC8C6|4.0|Rango was extremely enjoyable. Johnny Depp's performance as the title character was funny yet vulnerable. The quality of the animation amazed me. Textures looked very real. &#34;Glass&#34; was phenomenal. Most of all, the story was charming, the dialogue, snappy and very amusing.
B002M2N9JI|4.0|Originally heard this artist in a night club. &#34;Bulletproof&#34; is is a high paced but danceable song that tempted me to buy the entire c.d. Some of La Roux's songs are fun to listen to, but &#34;Bulletproof&#34; is still my outstanding favorite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I... I am just shocked by how Suzanne has moved me in a book I was ALREADY reluctant to read. I thought that I would get to attached to some characters, and then cry for days under my blanket. But after I actually sat there, bought the book, read the first few pages... I was  hooked into this world of panem. If you are like me, people who truly get into the story you read... then I promise you tears, I promise you anger, and I promise you joy from the hilarity of how stupid reality can be sometimes.
B000002VMH|5.0|This c.d. was utilized in the movie &#34;Striptease&#34; starring Demi Moore. Ms.Lennox's sultry smooth voice flows into you like warm smoke in the brain. Seductive. If you have time watch the movie & definately buy this c.d.
B006JRY2QG|5.0|Love this show very addictive. You ask why? Probably because of Jax, he is super sexy and bad to the bone. They break pretty much every law known to man but you can still see that they have somewhat good intentions. The show is well worth watching. At first I couldn't make it past the first episode but stick with it, all of the info you get in episode 1 starts to make since if you keep watching.
B005F2BBLK|2.0|I am a huge Johnny Depp fan, and I love animated/CGI films, but this one just didn't do it for me.  The story or the character, Rango just weren't enticing enough for me to continue watching it.  I actually forced myself the third time to finish it...what a waste of time.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Whether you're a lover of sci fi, fantasy, or just someone looking to find entertainment<br />this is your show. I will warn it is only 1 season long but definitely worth it. They even have<br />a movie which I also recommend but you must watch the show first before the movie.<br />Have fun and Hope you like it!
B0036G8IQS|5.0|I didn't read the book because I bought it for my daughter. She seems to have enjoyed it as I have seen her read it many times.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My 7 year old grandson would spend hours, if I let him, interacting with this app. It's like having a friend teasing him.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun to play and easy to use. My kids enjoy watching and listening to the horse. Great graphics and just overall pretty great.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Jesus the Christ is here put in opposition to Jesus of Nazareth, which may be discomfiting for some Christians. For me, it seems important to learn that a lot of what I value in Christianity really comes from St. Paul - especially since the author doesn't seem to care for St. Paul, and interestingly, puts him in oppostion to James, the brother of Jesus. I think it is important to know the origins of what you value in Christianity, whether or not that content sprang from the historical man, Jesus.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|It's really similar the previous ones, even though there are more reflections on the generational and historical cycles.<br />It's not really a proper novel, being more like an array of many stories, which are linked toghether in a somewhat artificial and strained manner.<br />Having said that, most of the stories are a deep psychological portrait of the human soul, both in its good and despicable traits.<br />I recomend this book to those who are looking for the various aspects of human behaviour. Here they are deeply reviewed,without false moral implications; it's just life as it goes.
B001GCUER0|5.0|i love this show.  and it's definitely something i could watch again and again.  great for passing the time on a rainy day
B005544TRQ|5.0|Very smart writing and story lines. Gabriel Macht and Patrick Adams are perfect in their roles. Highly recommend this series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard not too easy.  A great game.  This will keep you entertained and occupied. Highly recommend.<br /> Get this app!<br /><br />4
B0089OBLDO|5.0|I've been dying trying to find a product that would let me use an xbox 360 controller with my playstation 3, and thanks to this, my search is over. I have the best of both worlds now.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|I have enjoyed both the acting and scenery filming in this series.  I have some difficulty in understand some of the speech due to the british accent and volume of the recording.  However, it is far better than many of the british films in that respect.  I highly recommend watching this series.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Good game can not put it down!!!!!!! If u have time to kill this will do it.  Go with this game.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This is an outstanding book that explores the core of humanity as only an encounter with an alien species can reveal.  Original and gripping.  A classic to be enjoyed by all ages.  (It was recommended to me by my 28 year-old son!)  At least as good as s Ended's Game.
B0063M22QO|4.0|fun game, loaded easily works well. Will not work with a rotation of the screen but still play able. I would recommend this app.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|So how in the world do some people score $3000 in coins on daily tournament, lucky to even break $1000 which I think happened once. Most of the time score is $300 to $500. Also what is the point of the little bag of credits that counts down from 200 for some kind of bonus that never happened. It gets to 134 and goes back to 200. Plus I had a blue mark on the count down but then it just disappeared. This should be changed, maybe the goal is set too high, but can't figure out what the rules for this credit bag even are.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I love this game, it was worth the price. I was worried it was going to cut corners or something, being an app, but its the full game. graphics are even better than the 30 dollar DS version, which is amazing and the side quests are all set up nice and easy for you to do even with the lack of wifi abilities. (something I worried about.) If I have any complaint, its that playing it really eats my battery, and I am not sure charging my kindle constantly is healthy for it when I want to play it so often...
B0094BB4TW|1.0|News feed sucks!!! You can't click on something and comment or view some pictures without being taken all the way back to the top of the feed so you lose your place and have to scroll all the way back to where you were . After a few times of that just give up...
B008ODZNLG|5.0|I watched this movie with my son, who is 17 and trying to figure out what to do with his life. Corporate America no longer provides meaningful employment the way it once did. Small business and self-employment offer hope: Jiro approaches his job as an apostolate of sorts, seeking to enrich the souls of everyone he touches through the pursuit of utter perfection in his work.  Shortly after this movie started, I deeply regretted not buying it.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I love this app its easy and no glitches so far.  I would highly recommend this app to anyone who uses u tube a lot.
B005PW3OS8|5.0|Nothing brings out the love of your country like the good guys beating the bad guys. Captain America is no exception, brings out pride for our military and people when fighting for the right cause.
B0038NN3B4|5.0|Upon failing to loose weight following the &#34;traditional&#34; recommendations: reduce your calories, do a lot of exercise, eat a lot of &#34;good&#34; carbs (whole grain bread, etc), reduce your fat consumption, etc etc, I decided to give this a try. I knew this diet for a long of time, but once the traditional started to fail me (as you get old, your capacity to burn glucose/loose weight reduces), I was ready to break from mainstream thinking and start relativizing everything.<br /><br />And now things are REALLY relative indeed. But one thing is absolute: carbs are the enemy of weight loss. Well, at least if you are too used to burning them instead of your fat. Once you make your body a fat burning machine, carbs can be reincorporated but always &#34;in probation&#34; mode. This book will help you achieve your weight goals by attacking the REAL problem, which is your ability to burn body fat. The body is a complex machine, and thinking that the relationship &#34;excess calories = stored fat&#34; does really not hold in normal circumstances, only in extreme starvation (you loose fat and muscle) or when eating too many carbs for your metabolism, but few calories overal (you do not loose fat or even gain it).<br /><br />I have been in the diet for 3 1/2 weeks now and went from 189.8 lbs (86.1 kg) to 179.2 lbs (81.3 kg). I'm 5 6'. I'm about to reduce two belt holes since I started and my overall body looks much better than before.<br /><br />Of course, I still have a long way to go. My goal is between 165.3 (75 kg) to 154.3 lbs (70 kg), depending on my overall look, since I go to the gym and the added muscle adds &#34;good&#34; weight.<br /><br />I'll update this review depending on my progress, but so far this diet has been 5 out of 5 stars, really.<br /><br />Tonight I'm dinning one or two hamburgers, regular cheese, mayonnaise, and a good green salad with more mayonnaise and olive oil. And I may snack one or two quail eggs at 11, with some more cheese.<br /><br/>So, what are you low-calorie dieter dinning? ;D
B001LM1456|4.0|This story never gets old, I watched the original series with Bill Bixby, never missed a show, so the movies about the hulk are always a treat. I think Edward Norton does good justice to the character.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|I have read a lot of Baldacci's books, and so I thought this one would be good. Well...I was disappointed. I don't know if this new character is supposed to be his answer to Jack Reacher, but it really misses the mark. The writing was good, but the plot was so contrived. I got dizzy from rolling my eyes so much. The hero and his little \\"innocent\\" made many leaps in their conclusions from very limited information. bleh
B005MMY9A8|5.0|I am glad this movie was not overtly sexualized like Iron-Man, I was able to watch it with my kids. Enjoyed the clear message of good vs evil, Life lessons for our hero and the offering of a second chance to a brother gone bad. Especially loved the role of the father as a wise old man instead of the usual foolish role many fathers in movies and TV get.
0385344228|5.0|Could not put it down.  I am going to tell all my friends to please read it, It is excellent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a SUPER FUN and ADDICTIVE game. Although there are some in app purchases. I recommend you to download this NOW&hellip;you wouldn't regret it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love the show and can't stop watching it.  The story line is engaging and you can't wit to watch the next episode.
B001VFTYWI|1.0|I would have liked to read the rest, and so rate it approprately, but my Kindle died and I've not got a new one yet!
B009G41CG2|5.0|Not real easy so I like it a lot. Nice to have a challenge. Please play it you will have fun
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|Occasionally insightful, often hilarious, and always personal. &#34;Bossypants&#34; shares stories about rising in a male-dominated business with almost no grace and a lot of funny mistakes. I was entertained.
0783227434|5.0|This is my favorite B movie of all time so I fianlly got around t buying it. Just a fun time and Bruce Campbell is awesome.
B00CXQL828|4.0|Who would have thought that these three vets had this in them, considering the current state of rock music it's probably a small miracle this even got made. With more than a hint of Mid 80's Coverdale in his vocals Kotzen is the true star of this release. He proves to be more than able to be the front-man in this rock solid trio of players. Look no further than the second track &#34;Desire&#34; for a reason to pick this disc up, by far the best track and easiest to sing along to. It's not that the rest of the CD isn't as good, it's just that this one song shows a true understanding of and appreciation for what has come before. I'd be very surprised if they made another Cd but if this is the only thing they ever release, it's still not a bad disc to be remembered for.
B008OOYALE|2.0|I know the developers are out to make money, but I hate apps that require in app purchases for continuous play.  I removed this from my device.
B004JK61K0|1.0|Could not get this app to work with my email tried it several times but had no luck. Deleted app
B008MEM24S|5.0|Challenging game, but not so difficult that my 5 year old gives up.  There are enough &#34;rewards&#34; in the game to keep his interest.  I like the sound effects.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|good game. wont run unless you arenconnectednto the Internet. that's just plain aggravating.  the new vehicles.and worlds are a nice addition. once they fix it so you can play anytime this will be one of my top games again.
B008XBHIEY|5.0|my 11 year old loved all the jaws movies. On sat. we watched them back to back. she was so cute when she would jump and yell at the tv get out of the water. lol
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Enjoy the scenario and development of characters, good entertainment. I have recommended this series to many of my friends and am looking forward to next season.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Feels a lot like many other TV series with a very similar concept but still very enjoyable and fun (though many scenes and situations are totally unbelievable)
1250012570|5.0|this was the loveliest piece of fiction i've read in a while. i wouldn't even call it \\"young adult\\"; i am 32 and my 15 year old stepdaughter? she wouldn't even get it. she'd be like, \\"wait. they don't have iphones? and what is joy division?\\" i remember being young and in love. riding the bus. holding hands. sony walkmans. mixed tapes. this book is so much more than a book. it is a token of nostalgia. i am in love with it and i want to read it over and over again until i've memorized it. it's that special. i ordered the digital version originally, and just had to purchase a physical copy so i could keep it always and look at it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome and my kid loves it as well she watches me play and wants to do it her self.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I love this show. The actors are fabulous and so is the writing. Best suspense drama I have ever seen.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|Without giving away much, we live life as if we are in control of ourselves and our future. Are we really in control? Can we really say to ourselves that we are the only version of ourselves? Is it possible we are programmed to be who we are?
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Love the show.. But the quality of the playback is not so hot. Has to buffer alot.  Have netflix and it doesnt do that
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Great for the occasional on-the-road use.  Saved my skin quite a few times.  Especially handy in conjunction with remote desktop and dropbox with transferring files.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I saw this four times in the theaters, and now continue to watch it at home.  When you realize that there are people like this in so many families, you understand the struggles and even more so appreciate the victories.  And it shows we all have a little bit of &#34;crazy&#34; in each of us.  Jennifer Lawrence is mesmerizing.  Even when she is not the one speaking, her facial expressions will steal a scene.
B008518MOW|5.0|The best of an excellent franchise! Action, fun, drama 3D what more could you possibly want apart from another episode :-)
B00992CF6W|5.0|my son loves the glitches in the update if you have 1diamond then go to the working table and make a block you get back 9
B00D9PUXQY|3.0|i ve been listening to devildriver for some years now and seen them a few times live but I was wondering why they just don't really get the credit they deserve until I listened to their new album and figured it all out. the thing I love bout them is the guitar players rip but the issue I have is with dez who suffers from lead vocal syndrome. he sings over every inch of the music  that the band plays and never lets the music breathe or the guitar players to be heard. if you listen to the new album you will hear what I mean. the golden rule is always less is best and that applies to dez mostly. oh well. great production as always. enjoy.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|I had a hard time getting through this book, but my curiosity to find the killer made me finish it.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This was a real heart warmer<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and recommended it to anyone who loves animals.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|Bruce Willis, like us all, is getting too old for these demanding parts! He should move on to another &#34;type&#34;.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Really nice game :) whenever you are you can play morpg. That's cool . And I like nice graphics on that that is really surprising.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Great picture quality.. Good feed/stream. So so movie. Action was there... Movie doesn't really grip you like other marvel movies
B00640UICA|5.0|I love it and I hate it!  It's cute, it's fun, and it's a nice twist on the 'match-three' kind of games... BUT I'M STUCK!  LMAO.  It's the kind of game that makes you think and throws all kinds of little twists at you just when you think you've got it mastered.
B00DP8XSQ2|3.0|It cannot run using slow internet speed. I will not blame it but will blame my internet provider. I suppose that i would have enjoyed it as publicized.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too difficult but not so easy that you get bored. Just the right amount of challenge to keep you coming back for more. Almost went to a \\"cheat\\" site; but stayed with it and did it without any help.  Fun game...keep them coming!!!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|Stephen King is my favorite author simply for his creativity, both in his story telling and use of the English language. His long novels such as this, IT and Under the Dome are my favorite because you get totally submerged in the environment and characters. This novel is particularly intriguing because who isn't a little curious about JFK 's assassination? Most people nowadays accept that Oswald did it, but quits a few people still adhere to the conspiracy theory that he wasn't alone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Looking forward to seeing how Mary handles motherhood with everything else that's going on!!!<br /><br />I must say that I think the finale, with the exception of the last 20 minutes, fell a little flat for  me  following the previous episodes, but it was still a great season!!!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Love the plot, characters and storyline! cant wait for season 4. One of the best Sci Fi shows they have out!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Solitaire will always be around; and this is a good one.  Loads and plays fast, and there are several program modes.  Price is right as well.
B00ECUX7HC|4.0|Beautiful from start to finish.  It's a perfect compliment to their first album.  You can't put this group into one genre.  Jazz, blues, funk, soul, you name it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|probably the best note pad i have ever used. Good for me because i forget everything. and this note software can remember everything.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I really don't like this app.  One can not see the whole post with comments unless one opens the post, then hitting the back arrow takes the user back to the most recent post on the news feed.  If one wants to see remaining unseen as yet posts on the news feed, one must scroll until the desired post is found.  Hate!  Also cannot pull facebook up on the web anymore, always brings up m.Facebook, do not like m.Facebook!  Uninstalled!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|The cinematography was top notch. I recommend it for those action and gun blazing fans. The storyline is completely different from the original movie.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Perfect for reading books hands free! Just wish it would have stood up vertically also.Good value for the price I paid.
0451228731|5.0|This story doesn't have to drag you in; you're already there. The places the author takes you will be places you never wanted to go. Everything in this story could be very real and happening today. Right now. That's what makes this story so truly terrifying. I'd rate this as one of my top ten most favorite books of all time, and Mr. Suarez would be in fine company, indeed.
