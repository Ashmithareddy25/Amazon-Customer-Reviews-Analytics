B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I went into this book expecting to be let down, as The Shining is a classic.  While it is a different read than the original, King does not disappoint.  The characters are intriguing, the story line is classic King, &#34;where is he going with this next?&#34; It was interesting joining Dan on the ups and downs of his life and how it shaped him for what he needed to be in the end.  Can't WAIT for the movie.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King at his best! Absolute pleasure to read....excellent way to leverage off the Shinning! Can't help but wonder if the story will continue with Abra!
B0014DQSGW|5.0|We find it funny, amusing and watch when we want a good laugh!  I was very happy with the price and condition upon arrival.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited to finally be able to play Candy Crush on my Kindle. A little different format, but easy to use and so much fun to play. Like the fact that I can connect to Facebook and play, send lives and receive lives from my FB friends. Thank you for finally getting Candy Crush app for Kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|2.0|The sound on this streaming this season 3, episode 1 video was NG, frequently breaking up.  I'll try again to watch this episode later in hopes that the sound problem will have been resolved by then. Nonetheless, I do truly love this series, and would like to have free, Prime-member access to all the episodes of all the seasons,
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I read a lot and only King can hold your attention with such a force.  This story weaves together a terrifying scheme that makes you glad not to have psychic powers.  Another Stephen King must read.
B0064MGU98|5.0|the show is an easy watch....and easy to follow yet keeps you engaged.  I think the main actress is pleasant and her role is believeable.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I have decided I am not a fast reader... because I become so engrossed in the story and cannot move on unless I can \\"see\\" everything.  This book was worth the effort and I will read it again :)
B008NW1M4K|1.0|Come to think of it, my 1-star review of the book (which Amazon took down when the English version of the book came out) has, indeed, overlooked some of the book’s merits. How obtuse must I have been to overlook how the younger generations of the stupid masses could benefit from this book! This book can teach them a lot. So, for instance:<br /><br />(1) Hitler is not a scary fairy-tale figure. He has really existed. — This is important to know, particularly, since it has been doubted, even denied, that the Holocaust ever happened. From there, it would be only one step to assume that Hitler hadn’t existed either.<br /><br />(2) Hitler was not an alien. He was human; that’s what so many reviewers of the book have concluded after reading the book. (Besides, there is documented proof that Hitler was born to a — no, not a virgin, but to an earthly woman.)<br /><br />(3) Hitler was not a monster; that’s again what so many reviewers of the book have pointed out. And I can confirm that Hitler had two arms and two legs, and even some kind of a head; he didn’t have horns, nor did he spit fire, and he didn’t even have an equine club foot. (Thus, Hitler was lucky. Because had he been deformed in any way, he might have felt compelled to have himself euthanized.)<br /><br />(4) Hitler was somewhat likable; at least, that’s what so many reviewers took from this book. Well, I don’t quite understand why anyone in his right mind might want to portray a mass murderer of unimaginable dimensions likable. Yet, it says in the bible to love thee neighbor. And since, after WWII, with about 70 mio people dead (let’s forget about the questionable Holocaust, which many of the readers of the book might not believe in), most readers would find it somewhat difficult to outright love Hitler, the author might have wanted to compromise and portray Hitler as, at least, likable. Either that, or maybe, the author did not think of the bible at all but rather of the average intelligence of his potential readers and of his bank account. For commercial reasons, it is always advisable to have a likable protagonist, one that readers can relate to.<br /><br />(5) Contemporary German politicians are stupid. Yet in order to learn this true fact, readers could have saved themselves the expense for this book. Some might have already known, and those who didn’t, I could have told for free. (And not only GERMAN politicians are stupid, politicians of other countries … well, never mind; this is off-topic.)<br /><br />(6) Celebrities are not always what the public thinks they are. Good to know. Yet this knowledge could also easily be obtained otherwise.<br /><br />(7) It is o.k. to turn each and every mass murderer into a comic figure. Having people shot, blown up, hanged, or gassed is soooooo funny. Besides, humor is the best weapon for stopping evil tyrants. This is how Hitler and Stalin were stopped from murdering many millions of people. Wait a moment! I got a little confused here. Allow me. At age 75, I am entitled to a little brain fog. So forget it. Hitler and Stalin WEREN’T stopped, but they might have been stopped had people been able to read Timur Vermes’s book. Or maybe not. Never mind. Anyway, it is o.k. to write a humorous book about every evil murderer.<br /><br />(8) It is possible to make a fortune writing funny books about evil mass murderers. While not every wannabe bestseller-author may be successful with such a book, it is, at least, worth a try. (Advice to fledgling authors: Don’t start with a big mass murderer like Hitler or Stalin, start small with a serial killer or a school shooter, with no less than 12 and no more than 50 victims. If this works out, you can always advance to bigger book projects, such as making an avuncular, likable protagonist out of Saddam Hussain or Nero — Nero, I said, not Nehru, stupid! )<br /><br />(9) People can return from beyond. Yet here, I have to admit that it was a disadvantage not to haveread the whole book. I don’t know how it explained how Hitler managed to perform this task. But I am sure that the smartest of the not-so-smart readers will have figured out a way how this could be done, even though (as I have heard) the author did not bother to elaborate.<br /><br />(10) Some optimistic reviewers have suggested that this book might induce so far uneducated and ignorant readers to follow up with more advanced reading. And this may be true. “Mein Kampf” is available here on Amazon and has huge numbers of wonderful reviews, just as “Er ist wieder da”.<br /><br />However, for those with somewhat elevated brain function, I would recommend a few other books instead of the above mentioned. For instance:<br /><br />“Hitler: The Memoir of the Nazi Insider Who Turned Against the Fuehrer, by Ernst Hanfstaengl<br />“Berlin Diary”, by William Shirer<br />“Survival in Auschwitz”, by Primo Levi<br />“The Reawakening”, by Primo Levi<br /><br />And if something humorous is desired, by all means, look for a different topic.<br /><br />(Note for those who are a bit slow on the uptake: If this review confuses you, please look up the words “satire”, “sarcasm”, and “irony”.)
1455576387|5.0|Another great Baldacci thriller, pertinent and believable in these currant times. I appreciate  his subject matter, and ability to integrate  primary characters and bring their stories together for a meaty page turner that's hard to put down. I always recommend this author's books to friends.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy Amazon has candy crush. I sent feedback to add it on the Appstore all the time. It's finally here and I'm addicted. Download this game. BEST GAME EVER!!!!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants insight on the way those most important to them think and feel. Very informative and helpful in understanding the different types of Love Languages and how to &#34;speak&#34; them even when they're not your Love Language. Loved it!

B009UNGYHG|5.0|The battery of this thing last long and recharge the Plantronics Voyager Legend well.<br /><br />I had to purchase it separately because the Plantronics Voyager Legend came without anything.<br /><br />It's the size of a wallet a little bit thick, it charges really fast as well.<br /><br />I recomend this if you are using Plantronics Voyager Legend
B007SVPZMW|4.0|Pretty fun. Great game for kids and adults. My daughter loves playing this game with me.  It's a great mobile version of a classic game.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|new game, new characters, bunches of fun. Both myself and my kids love this game. Like the others, it's quick, challenging, and has a variety of different scenarios. Very Nice.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Whatever you do, DON'T sign out. It keeps saying try again later and I do, but it DOESN'T work. This was the fastest way to talk to my friends, but now I can't. KIK PLEASEEEE LET US GET IT BACK
B000ICXQXI|5.0|great classic horror. awesome movie - can never watch it enough! If you have never seen it, you are missing out.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|By far one of the most addictive games, can not stop playing. Love it.If they can just make more ways to earn guru. Coins that would be awesome.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so much! It is so fun and actually requires some strategy so I don't feel like I'm just killing brain cells playing it... even though I probably am! Lol. I am so happy that the Amazon appstore finally got this. This is the real one too not just some scam someone is trying to sell as the real deal. I have had to play it on my friends phones for the longest time and now I have it too! =) My only complaint is that you can't buy lives or anything you have to go through Facebook. I am not allowed to have a Facebook account so it is very inconvenient for me and people like me. But other than that it is a fun game and I would recommend it to anyone. Hope this was helpful!! =D
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It is very fun I thought it would be boring the jelly fish get on my nerves but other than that this game is great  if you have a little boy or girl they will love this game
6305903182|4.0|Ghost face isn't a character it's a costume.  I find that puzzling to say the least.  It makes all the murderers copy cats, plagiarists, wholly lacking in originality, nonentities until revealed and even then the \\"surprise\\" only works once.  At least this entry started out like an action flick.  That didn't amount to much, unfortunately, the rest was par for the course; a guy in a silly costume chasing people through buildings.  Run, chase, hack-hack-slash.  The prime motive remains the same: revenge.  It's always been a family affair.<br />The only thing that keeps me watching this series is the few surviving characters: David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Neve Campbell.  In this one, Parker Posey provided a few laughs.  Carrie Fisher's brief appearance was jarring.  Otherwise, business as usual.  At least the big reveal didn't include an over the top performance, bug-eyes and people who don't know how to properly hold a gun.  Some rudimentary thrills but not a bit scary, the filmmakers don't stray far from expectations, they know their formula well at this point.  I actually liked it better than the first installment with all its pretentions.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Saves my day when my phone alarm fails me. Has nice digital features like the blue LED looking clock. My favorite has to be the clock that tells you the time in word.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I purchased this book because of my undying love of \\"The Shining\\".  I just HAD to know what became of Danny Torrence. This book answered all my questions, not only about Danny, but also of his mom, Wendy. A descent into madness and evil is truly to be feared, and not one of us is immune. The perseverance of the characters in this novel is commendable, especially the girl, Abra. If you are a King fan, you must read this.....I totally recommend it.
0425263924|5.0|It was everything they said it was and it didn't take long for me to receive it either!! thanks for selling it to me I really loved it so much!!!! I couldn't be more satisfied with the price, shipping and delivering process!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Felt like the old Stephen King.  Loved knowing how the character was doing.  The author is so good at making the, seemingly, normal scary as hell.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|It took me a little while to get into it but then I couldn't put it down!  A good Book Club read.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Lot's of over and over, but addicting and hard to put down. A big battery sucker due to the graphics. Felt my S4 getting warm. Sucked the life outa my Kindle, but I still play it a lot and enjoy it. Takes a bit of time to understand the strategies if you don't read the screens and just go forward. Lot's of fun!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I like it, it is challenging and I like the cast of characters it is very addictive game. I recommend it it is well worth your time.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved this sequel to The Shining! Another fantastic book Mr. King.  Thank you for following up in an intriguing way.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so happy to finally be able to play candy crush on my kindle it's about time.....Thanks a lot this game is extremely addictive
B005CKPQNE|5.0|Not much more to say about BB -- regardless of season. Difficult to imagine that it could have been written, produced, directed or 'acted' any better.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|This came quick and in great condition! I would recommend and do this again! Wouldn't even have to think about it.
0141324910|5.0|My grandson who is a precocious young reader immediately fell in love with this series. He sinks right into the story and stays with it until the end with only minor breaks in the day. This must be good. He has read many other chapter book series by popular writers but the Wimpy books are on top.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|This came quick and in great condition! I would recommend and do this again! Wouldn't even have to think about it.
B0011MRKHW|5.0|I love it! The acting was so out spoken. The clothes were so out standing. The lady has nerves of steels. I will watch it over and over,
B0080SFQU8|5.0|My 4 year old granddaughter sings this song frequently, and I join her. How many of us could start out with white shoes, then step into all sorts of 'things', have their shoes change color with each incident, and not have our mothers or fathers unhappy?<br /><br />My daughter would probably join my granddaughter in stepping in messes. She likes to jump in mud puddles with her. This is such a wonderful time to bring up your children, when most everything that is safe is OK to do. Pete The Cat, is the kind of character that most children want in their lives. Someone who is happy most of the time, sings his own songs, makes messes, laughs about it and, then, moves on to the next interesting thing.<br /><br />The illustrations are vivid and colorful. The writing catches each child. The songs are fun, and Pete The Cat has become a beloved character to all.<br /><br />Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-17-13
B00123KF54|5.0|I heard Graham Nash being interviewed on the radio, and they played a tune from this album.  I was transported back to my teens.  I downloaded the songs and still remembered all the lyrics!  The music is still great all these years later!
B008Q07GLW|5.0|Newman and Redford as Butch and the Kid. A must-see. If, which is highly unlikely, you have never seen it, you've missed a great American film.
B009UAO1ZG|5.0|This is history painted on a broad canvas - an excellent book. I am an avid reader and this is an area that I have not touched upon. I have asked myself many times &#34;why weren't we better prepared for the war&#34; and &#34;why didn't we go to Britain's aid in 1940.&#34;  I now have a better appreciation of the diversity of public opinion and the power of the isolationists. Also, Roosevelt's reluctance to push ahead with the inevitable conflict. Lynne Olson tries hard to capture Lindbergh (he was a strange bird). She also does a very nice job covering Anne Morrow and the Morrow family.<br /><br />I am rereading the book. Any number of subtopics within the book call out for another tome. For example, the pathetic shape of our army in 1939. It puts today's ugly times in perspective.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|many surprises...every episode ends with a cliff hanger...can't wait til next season...my son thinks I'm a wimp for watching it but he hasn't developed an appreciation for the arts yet!
B003G4W49C|2.0|Why are people so hung up on this book? What are they seeing that i'm not?<br />For one thing the book is dark and depressing. There really are no happy moments in this book. Ender gets manipulated, pushed and pulled at all times. There are no strong characters or at the least there are no strong character interactions. In the book the teachers try to keep Ender isolated and they do a good job. Even the enemy, the buggers are but a vague distant threat. There is even a point in the book where a character says that the buggers have never attacked a civilian installation unprovoked. Wait... what? The action is often vague at best and there are numerous time skips throughout the book, from days to years. The ending itself was also underwhelming and anticlimactic. Overall I found the book dark depressing and just plain boring.<br /><br />I understand this is only the first book in a series but I have no desire to continue.
0553062182|4.0|My brother's therapist recommended this book to him, and he recommended it to me. We have both found it to be very helpful and thought provoking. Offers useful insight and helpful tools for managing difficult and sometimes overwhelming feelings.
B00ENTDDGW|3.0|it was a good game for my grandsons to play, but it was to bright for my eyes, so I don't play it much.
B00BFV1K2A|4.0|I've done my time under a real-life totalitarian regime in a different time and place, and I know that no matter how heroic and beautiful an example is it won't start a revolution until every single person has had enough, got nothing left to lose, and generally don't care whether they live like that or die. I've also fought more than my share of uphill battles (and lost a few jobs, too) trying to stir people to stand up to their unfair bosses here and now. So I know what's realistic and what's not. But, despite all that, these books are simply impossible to put down until you're through them. Or maybe because of that: maybe it's exactly because they've shown me what I wanted to see, but have never seen, in real life.<br />Except the ending. That was really, really dispiriting. Nothing inspires you more than the truth of your legend. And by contrast, nothing de-motivates worse than seeing your legend fizzle out into something ordinary.<br />When I was Katniss' age, my mother would tell me that I'd outgrow it all. Now, in my mid-forties, I know for sure: once on fire, always on fire - unless, of course, it's just a designer suit that one can easily discard in favor of something more fashionable. And it doesn't matter where you live, in the third world (the Districts) or here (the Capitol), you can't lock that fire inside because it'll burn you from within. Injustice will always be injustice, although it's important to remember that the only rebellion that deserves to win is the one that strives to affirm, protect, and uphold, rather than avenge, punish, and destroy - or merely replace one master with another.<br />With all that in mind, I'd have written some of this story differently, especially the third and final book. Well, maybe I should stop ranting, sit down, and write something of my own.<br />Which is exactly my point: these books don't just leave you be. They keep coming back to you; in your mind, you keep arguing with the whole story, with the characters, and so on. If for nothing else, then for that alone they are definitely worth reading.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This games is great. I downloaded it to my kindle fire HD, but it doesnt sinc correctly to my  facebook account. It started me on the wrong level...about 60 level behind. I hope they update the software soon. Other than that its a great game to play with or without wifi.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Had a great time reading this. Hard to put down and really very thought provoking. I would recommend it, especially to women.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Awesome! King did not disappoint. It's always great to catch up with old characters, I wish he would do it more often!
B00AQO1VYY|3.0|I had heard of Mad Season but had not paid much attention to them (for reasons that were unclear since I am a fan of all of the bands from which the members came from) until I saw an awesone live performance of theirs on Palladia.<br /><br />I was blown away and immediately ordered this CD/DVD package. Had I carefully reviewed a couple of the less favorable reviews I would have realized that despite the incredible pedigree of most of the band members that their sum as represented by Mad Season was less than their individual talents.<br /><br />Unlike the Palladia concert, the vast majority of the tunes are pretty mellow, uninspiring and repetitive.  Even the live CD (there is a studio and a concert CD) failed to live up to expectations.  I'm hoping that the DVD is of the same concert that was shown on Palladia but I have not yet watched it.  That's the only reason I'm even giving three stars.
0439321603|5.0|This book is a great insight into the world of harry potter.  It helps you to understand the creatures talked about in that world.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Nazis, ageless wonders, ruthless murders, FBI agents, jungles, etc. These things in one book, oh my. Preston and Child have a Winner in Pendergast. Keep them coming.
B00E9P959O|1.0|Too Tinny...like someone turned the trebble way up. It's missing the heavy feel of all the songs. The Bass it \\"picky/clicky\\" like Geddy was playing with a pick and lacks the heavy end sound, and no middle...not worth the $$. Should be $5-$6. The original may not be perfect, but it was right for it's time.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|There is some terrific writing, interesting philosophical questions,  and intriguing plot twists once you pick up this book.  It's a fun read and a rather huge departure from Samsersona other work.  It lacks some of the sophistication of the Mistborn series or The Way of Kings, but is a terrific lighter read.  The main character is engaging and the dystopia he lives in is an interesting twist on our world.  Highly recommended.I
B001974DG0|4.0|Not dark like some of his other books. There is a psychopathic bad guy with not much of a back story but the story of the good guys is very strong with a good ending.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book and the many stories that he weaves into the book. It is a full and bountiful book, just as he previous books have been. It gives a small peak into a culture and world that is not a part of my daily living, for which I am grateful.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I've always been a semi-fan of McCartney, having leaned more toward Lennon and Harrison for songwriting.  This has been my response to his lyrics, all in all.  As nobody could ever criticize McCartney in terms of melody.<br /><br />Now let me make this proposition.  Lyrics often dictate melody.  So when you have a lyric like &#34;Silly Love Songs,&#34; then you get...well, a silly love song melody and arrangement.  I think the lyrics on this one hold up the genius of McCartney's melodic sensibility.  They're not &#34;Howl&#34; or some undergrad Shakespeare.  They're just solid and good.  I guess time teaches all.  Great wines do become greater with the years.  McCartney gets better, and that's a damned fine gift.<br /><br />I'd personally place this up with the only other McCartney solo record I totally like, Flowers in the Dirt.  There is some edge here, which isn't characteristic, and some maturity hard won...a guy in a bubble since his early twenties isn't going to have the psychic heft of, say, Garcia Marquez.  Or anyone that weathered.<br /><br />The other reviewers typically do better than me on most stuff.  All I can say is:  A very fine record.  I do sometimes wish McC didn't rely on his descending modal scales for his melodies, but since nobody else writing is smart enough to do that, what must be must be.  A couple of 1/4/5s would not wreck the man, I feel.  But if you're looking for pop music at it's greatest recent incarnation, you could not go wrong with this one.<br /><br />Everyone else said everything.  Great production, great singing, great playing.  But for McCartney to hit this high, at this stage, is a moment of wonder, and I would recommend everyone share in it, because the moment and the experience of any work of art, well, it's not the same once the verdigris hits the brilliant copper dome, if you get my drift.
B009MB682W|4.0|Simply that. A walk through the movies I've seen and enjoyed for years. There are a couple of peices here and there that I don't care about/recognize. But some are vivid.

B00DV2D0JC|5.0|The puzzles were fun with hints as needed. The game moved along at a good pace. It was worth the price!
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Great Pinball game but the latest three tables cannot be bought.  It gives a notice that the latest patch must be applied. WHAT PATCH? The game updated to show the three new tables to be purchased so they should have included the PATCH in it. I would give a 5 star rating if fixed. P.S. These tables can be purchased in the Zen Pinball game with no problem but the Star Wars game version has additional features above just the tables in the Zen version.<br /><br />Now that the game has finally been updated I can buy the tables and they are all great. If your Kindle does not automatically update the program - go to the App Store and do a search for this game and when it appears it will say update instead of open.

B003SI3URQ|2.0|Didn't enjoy this movie.  Very focused on the underworld and Disney found a way to make it acceptable yet still very disturbing (esp. for kids).  I would not recommend this movie.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|If  you have been avoiding this game because of the bad reviews, I can tell you it's been fixed. About a third of the way in the game asks you to unlock more, but when you do, it's free.<br /><br />This game ranks up at the top with some of the best ones for kindle. It is very long and pretty well organized.  The HOG are sharp, even if some are small. I like how when you click on an inventory object, on the screen little circles appear to show where it might go. The only thing I don't like is you have to like on Facebook to get the strategy guide.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I forgot about this movie until i saw it on prime.... this is an amazing movie and I love it.

B007HACDLK|5.0|This has to be Flynn's best book yet.  Could not put it down and the detail he goes into has you believing that this story is real and is happening in today's world.  Suspenseful, exciting and awaiting the next book!  Definitely recommend - it is a great read!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|quality story line in a beautiful setting.  and the historical details make it even better. and let's not forget the great acting.
B0089LOG02|3.0|I chose this book because I've recently learned that my grandfather could have been on an orphan train. It provided a view of a  little known 'event' in our country's recent history (early 1900s).  The story line was interesting and I enjoyed the back and forth of the two lives. However, it was very predictable - especially the ending.  I do hope to read some nonfiction about the orphan trains now.
B009NY43NY|4.0|Didnt love the ending but I love the series!  You relate to every character at some point or another.  I have never seen True Blood but read everybook.

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|What a great book. I was holding my breath at the end hoping he wasn't found guilty. I find myself feeling like I'm in her characters spot. She does a great job at going through all the emotions of all the characters.
B008J34466|5.0|Anything Pink does is great.  I love her voice and no nonsense attitude.  She is great live in concert.  If you like Pink, purchase this album.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for this game! and all I can say is addictive!!!!!!!!!! I 'm having so much fun.
B004DL5K2K|1.0|I also agree with many reviewers on this-it was only put out to keep from paying original musicians, Bob Daisley & Lee Kerslake the royalties owed them. This is a disgrace to musicians and listeners alike. You can never re-do a recording later, taking away valuable parts, and inserting re-done lame parts. The magic was made with Randy, Bob, & Lee. Then Ozzy came in with vocals, written by others- mainly Daisley, who didn't get credit or pay deserved. Fellow musicians will agree-give me credit for the work I do. Pay is great too, but credit for great music can't be replaced. For Sharon, it's all about how much money Ozzy can earn for HER. A real shame...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you finally on kindle fire I will play all night I just love candy crush I have the game on my I phone on level 77 I'm ready to get started thanks again
B005HP2JAM|3.0|Story was ok- too long for the material at hand, and Werner's voice bothers me. The ghoasting was horrible but shootiong in a cave can't be too easy. Was just ok- didnt need to own it,  as part of my 3D collection.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's entertaining to keep up with the goings on in the family.  Love the period and the way they talk.
B008EKMB82|5.0|Yes, it is amazing.  Not only is it well-written but the story is so unusual that you don't find yourself saying, &#34;Oh Yeh, this is what happens next.&#34;  It was our book club selection and everyone but one person enjoyed it.  The one holdout could not get passed the first quarter of the book because, to her, it was too depressing.  She suffers from depression and the book seemed, to her, a real downer.  If she could have read a little farther, it would have definitely turned around for her.  And, overall, the ending for all of the characters was redemtive.
B00867HDTA|1.0|A more appropriate name would be Flick a Soccer Ball. It's nothing more than a constant penalty shootout while trying to hit a bull's eye that's moving around in the goal. Quickly uninstalled.
B003G4W49C|5.0|From Heinlein to Card. Beautiful science fiction that is so much more than its genre. Great interplay and development of characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game. I would really recommend it .it is so fun! I spend time with my brother and displaying this.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Was fun to watch, and had a decent story. It was shot well and had nice 3D. A good one to own.
B007THA4FI|1.0|It is a terrible, terrible book. I cannot believe the author of the Harry Potter books and The Cuckoo's Calling, which I recommend, wrote this trash. It is horrible. Avoid it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Excellent upgrade from basic power cord for the kindle fire. Original cord was really sensitive. Great and prompt service as always.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|LOVE it! A wonderful look into Danny's life after the Overlook. Never a dull moment for that man in his while life!
B003VANOFY|3.0|I was really excited about these headphones.<br />Pros<br />Sound quality is great<br />Has good range<br />Comfortable enough to wear for a long time<br />Cons<br />Disconnects randomly. Not sure if this is a USB issue with my computer or an issue with the USB dongle. Happens maybe 2-3 times a day. Reconnects after about 5 seconds, mostly just a nuisance.<br />Battery seems too go dead more quickly than estimated in the Utility. Full charge indicates 9 hours remaining on battery, it's seems like it only lasts between 6-7.<br />Charging cable appears to be loose, sometimes it doesn't charge when plugged in.<br />Final thoughts<br />The awesome sound and comfort is why I rated these headphones 3 stars, would be 1 star otherwise. Probably just a fluky headset I got as all of my other Logitech devices have been excellent.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Incredible movie, I hope they make a sequel to it and brad pitt agrees to star in it. If you like zombies this is the movie for you.
0553593714|5.0|This is a great book.The author has a great way of painting a picture of each scene and also the charters.The book is worth every penny.
158270208X|5.0|I bought this book as a gift for a friend.  I was very impressed with the quality of the book.  Not only it's structure but the format of the pages and alotted space for recording you ideas, gratitudes and blessings.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH ITS SO AWESOME IT'S A LOT BETTER THAN THE OTHER ONE IT'S SOOOOOO MUCH BETTER THAN REAL STEEL HD
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have tried tons of the alarm apps available for KINDLE and this alarm clock xtreme is by far the most reliable and user friendly I have found.  I use it exclusively now because of all the other alarms this is the only app that seems to work correctly, while providing a vast array of options.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|A beautiful film, especially for those of us who remember  the period of the cold war,and the fall of the Berlin Wall. Tremendous performances,  beautifully filmed. Full of tension and surprises especially when, long after the wall came down, a researcher is able to examine documents and finds a seemingly innocuous clue that really explains the entire movie. Great scene of one of the principals, reduced from Stasi official to mailman, wheels his mail bag past the Karl Marx Bookstore but is free to enter and buy any book he chooses.  A must see.
B003Y5H574|4.0|This movie is funny and sweet and romantic and surprising. If you're a female, you may like this film by default. I think it's 'okay' enough for males to stomach, as well.<br /><br />If you need a gift for a female coworker, or a niece, or a female friend, this would be a decent option. Add some ingredients for s'mores and popcorn, and it's probably one of the most thoughtful gifts ever. Just saying.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved the latest novel from Stephen King! It's a great follow-up to the characters we fell in love with in &#34;The Shining.&#34; Great plot line. Love also the detailed knowledge about Alcoholics Anonymous expressed as a major plot line in the story. The message of AA and recovery &#34;shines&#34; through the story. Great read. Page-turner. Love this book.
1451673442|5.0|Rhonda Byrne has done it again.  Absolutely love her books and the daily inspiration they provide!! Would definitely recommend reading them to everyone.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I gave this 5 stars it is an amazing book , after 50 shades of grey trilogy I didn't think I would love another as much but I have to say bared to you better and can't wait to reader the other 2 in the trilogy
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book ,totally  unexpected.i would recommend it to any fan of Stephen King. I wanted to read it in one sitting. Still I hated to come to the end. I will read it again, I always reread the ones I love. Like visiting old friends.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Works good on kindle tablet<br />I enjoy playing this game , I often play it when I'm supposed to be doing something else
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|This was a fun read! Lots of action and interesting characters. There are plenty of plot twists and surprises. I will be reading the other Jack Reacher books.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Have heard the audiobook is much better. Easy to pick up and put down without losing your spot. Hype was bigger than the actual read.
B005R32L66|5.0|This app works very well on my android device.<br />I like it!<br />I recommend Skype for many reason especially to save and fun!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has an amazing way of getting you to know each and every charactor as an old friend. This book does not disapoint. Although it may not be his normal horror story it is one of my favorites. I'll admit to being a Stephen King hog when it comes to anything he has written and hope that he continues to give more to feast upon.
B001GH5KM4|1.0|This MP3 is defective. It plays halfway, then stops. I Thought maybe it got corrupted when transferring in Itunes.  I Then listen to the original purchase on windows media player.  It was the same problem.  I then went back on Amazon MP3 store and purchased again. Same problem again. This MP3 should be replaced so customers can get satisfaction from their purchases.[[ASIN:B001GH5KOW Have You Ever Seen The Rain? (Album Version)]]<br /><br />Choose instead -[[ASIN:B000UBQORC The Long Road Home - The Ultimate John Fogerty/Creedence Collection]]<br />The song is on this album and it sounds great, and plays perfectly.
B00FIYGYKS|4.0|Got into Trivium around when In Waves came out.  Now, they're one of the main bands I listen to, In Flames is first.<br />The album is pretty good.  I like In Waves a bit better, but Vengeance falls definitely isn't bad by any means.<br />If you're a Trivium fan, you'll like it, buy it and support the band so they can come out with more.<br /><br />If you can see them live, you should.  In Flames and Trivium playing together is always a great show.  They're both entertaining, great stage presence, and have great music.  Get in the pit too.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I could not put this book down. The recurring addictive challenges faced by Adam in spite of his Seal training will give hope to those normal people experiencing similar problems in life. Very inspirational and very sad. I never really knew what these courageous individuals went through in their bid to rid the world of the evil forces of terrorism. Would recommend as a must read to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game<br />really fun it really gets your mind working it really needs more levels ten levels are just not enough<br />  u u
B007FEFLTO|4.0|good read, well researched as always. Some redundancy but necessary  for those who either didn't read the first volume or had forgotten details. Some characters not as well developed as first volume and there are so many more of them! Still, left me waiting for volume 3 with great anticipation!
0385342039|5.0|I was laughing out loud on the bus, train and at home during the first half of the book.  I had to share some of the funny things that were happening in the story to my family, and then they would laugh too.  The second half of the book becomes more serious.  Just a great fun read.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Its great for kids but when you update the app it takes forever to download then load extra info when you open the app.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|enjoyed the book once I got past all the characters being introduced at a rapid rate.That style was a bit annoying especially if you're reading it on a kindle and can't readily look back on previous pages.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really liked it.my mom read it now I'm reading it.i might read it again because it's do good love it
B003G4W49C|5.0|Good read with a deeper question of who humanity truly is. Looking forward to reading the rest of the quintet.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Simple to install and easy to use.  Really a game changer.  It so great to watch Youtube videos on larger screens and utilize the audio equipment without all of the wires.
B008Y212PI|4.0|I really enjoy these games. I don't think this one is the best of the flip pix line but all of them are fun.
B00457WZEI|5.0|Great book. I saw the movie.<br />But reading the book is much more vivid<br />Great read. Go ahead and read it.
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|&#34;The Conjuring&#34; is my favorite type of supernatural horror film. It has deeper meaning to it than just getting people scared. Everything about it is top shelf solid quality horror. I also applaud any movie that makes people think about the reality of God and the Devil.<br /><br />The Perron family is terrorized by what they come to believe is a spiritual presence in their home. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren come to the family's aid and discover that it's not only haunted but dwelled in by the demonic spirit of a witch who cursed the land she was hung on. Can the Warrens find a way to rid the house of the evil before it takes a tragic toll on the Perrons?<br /><br />Although it's based on actual events, everyone knows &#34;The Conjuring&#34; has been sensationalized for a movie-going audience. That doesn't change the fact that it demands its audience ponder the existence of a spiritual world outside of the physical one we can see, touch, hear, and smell. It also makes a point of letting you know that just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it's not real.<br /><br />The biggest scares you'll get from &#34;The Conjuring&#34; aren't even necessarily the ones you'll see and hear onscreen. I found myself more frightened after the film ended. I was left thinking about it in the &#34;real&#34; world. That's the beauty of a great horror film - it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.<br /><br />Let's just call it like it is. &#34;The Conjuring&#34; is the &#34;Amityville Horror&#34; of this decade. There's a lot of speculation around the Amityville house, but it's famous and put this movie's paranormal detectives in in the headlines and on TV. This is a story so fascinating that you don't want to believe it. However, somewhere in the back of your head you know it's true.<br /><br />&#34;The Conjuring&#34; is rated R for sequences of disturbing violence and terror. There's no nudity in the film. Some bad language can be found as well.<br /><br />The DVD version of &#34;The Conjuring&#34; includes a short featurette taking viewers behind the scenes of the film. It's entitled &#34;Scaring the &#34;@$*%&#34; Out of You&#34; and features interviews with the cast and crew. It's not much, but gives you an insight into what it takes to make this type of film.<br /><br />Many Christians and religious folks will no doubt disagree with demonic possession being used as a vehicle for entertainment. I look at it as an opportunity to expose and educate a generation of people who have come to believe in nothing and just live life the best they can in spiritual darkness. I know that's pretty heavy thinking put into what most look at as a horror movie.<br /><br />&#34;The Conjuring&#34; has everything you could want in one supernatural film. There's the old creepy house, demons, ghosts, a hanging tree, a freaky doll, and so much more. I can't think of a single genre item it missed. The funny thing is, it doesn't feel over-stuffed or like it's going to burst at the seams. It's just a good old-fashioned supernatural thriller that will entertain and make the audience ponder it well past the closing credits.found as well.<br /><br />The DVD version of &#34;The Conjuring&#34; includes a short featurette taking viewers behind the scenes of the film.

B00BPDR3F6|4.0|What an incredible talent Elizabeth Gilbert has. The characters from the story are drawn with wit and exquisite feeling and detail, and as a result I felt as if I was there with the characters, a part of their story.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|the dvd was everything I wanted, no commercials, the add ons where great, I love this show. the dvd was everything i hoped for.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a big Stephen King fanatic, reading majority of his books. Doctor Sleep was another great novel from him. Fantastic character development, including I'm guessing some personal history from King himself in terms of battling addiction which is a subplot in the novel. I hadn't read The Shining in 15 or so years and had no problems reading this, everything is described for the most part. The book takes vampires and adds an interesting twist which was loads of fun to learn about.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Dragon vale when I logged out of facebook I lost my whole profile! On that profile I had s platinum dragon and the legendary dragon!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had the issue of low memory..low storage on my first generation kindle fire. I cleaned everything off except two apps and still had no storage. this app cleaned videos I didn't know were on my device and the residuals left by uninstalled apps for a total of 2.5 Gb. definately earns 5 stars...very easy to use.
B000O599WG|5.0|My favorite John Wayne film. The extras on this are very entertaining and what make the 2 disc set worth buying. Also, the commentary track with John Carpenter and Richard Schielkel is well done and interesting.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I loaded Kindle on my Galaxy S3 and each time I launch the app I'm prompted to download it even after I ran the update. I try to uninstall and my phone says its a system file, no good!
B0017XD3OY|4.0|The first time I saw this film, it scared the living day lights out of me because the premise behind the film could actually come true!  However, Will Smith does a great job playing the lone, main character.  The script, CGI, and directing are great.  It is a very well made film.  Great for Halloween or anytime.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|it's  the big bang theroy need I say anymore get it and enjoy the man that is howard the pimp let's go
B00846REIS|3.0|Ok. So, have you read Fifty Shades? Well then, you've read this one. I'm still trying to figure out my feelings on this book.<br /><br />As an author I love her writing. She is very gifted in opening a story and pulling you along for a great ride of emotions and conflicts to resolutions and contentment. But, the fact that this is literally a re-tell of Fifty Shades I am having a hard time respecting the book as a whole. I feel sort of cheated in a way.<br /><br />The similarities are ridiculous--the characters are the same the feelings and the conflicts are the same. It's ALL the same.<br /><br />He's Dominate and has to have her the moment he sees her--Christian<br />He's gorgeous and a billionaire and 28--Christian<br />He wants to constantly put her over his knee--Christian<br />He's irrational and mercurial--Christian<br /><br />The list is endless, I stopped keeping tally about half way in. The sex was written well and you got that part of their relationship but the scary things was how it was used to define them and how they dealt with problems--both of them.<br /><br />Like I said, she's a great writer and I did enjoy the dialogue and pacing so there is that. Actually that is what upped my rating. Now, I will be curious to read more of her work because I think she can tell a good story. Just don't ride other author's coattails. Be original and refreshing--it'll have readers coming back for more.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This story has many twists and turns, which kept me reading until I finished.  The wife is so conniving and manipulative, her husband seems like putty in her hands.  He is no slouch, though, and they learn so much more about each other in their move to his home town.  Hope this story is all fiction!
0385743564|5.0|Awesome book, if you like Sanderson you gotta read his latest book its well worth it! So different from his other books but sooo goood!!!!
B005HEFB6M|5.0|I really like the Star Trek Series.  The first season of Enterprise is interesting and I enjoyed it.  It kept our interest.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|5 Stars is not enough for this classic book. You will not put it down. I think it' his best work.<br />  Steve Tuers
B003M70O5O|3.0|SOA is sort of like a soap opera. You can miss an episode here or there, or you can tune out for awhile, and then quickly pick up the story. To some extent, all of the various plots are variations on the same theme: the motorcycle club is in decline (as are most contemporary organized criminal organizations), Jackson is ambivalent about the gangster life (he wants out, but can never seem to get out, because the pressure to make the money to exit has him trapped), and the community (and society) are changing in ways that threaten the viability of motorcycle club culture.<br /><br />Some of the writing is uneven. Law enforcement sets up Opie - Jackson's best friend - to look like a &#34;rat.&#34; Having arrested him on serious charges, his bail is suddenly arranged, his mortgage (about to be foreclosed, putting his family - wife and 2 kids - onto the street) is brought current, his truck payments are brought current, and his debts are resolved. Law enforcement makes sure the club finds out that the government is responsible for Opie's changed circumstances. The president of the club (Jackson's stepfather) and one of the other officers are convinced that Opie is a &#34;rat,&#34; decide to kill him, botch the hit, and end up killing his wife by accident.<br /><br />Great story idea. Lots of inter-club conflict and drama. Except somebody should have talked to a lawyer. [By education and historical avocation, I am a lawyer.]<br /><br />In real life, the suspicious club members - having talked to their lawyer - would have called Opie in and said, &#34;We think you're a 'rat.' We've got this documentation here - that's right, the government gave it to them in writing - that the government paid all this stuff for you. We hope you're a 'rat.' Let us tell you about everything we've ever done, so you can be sure to include it in your testimony against us. Please go tell the government everything, so they can hurry up and charge us. Bribing witnesses is a felony. In court, our lawyers are going to tear you and the government apart. For what they've paid you, the jury will believe you'd testify to being the guy on the grassy knoll in Dallas in 1963 and the true kidnapper of the Lindbergh baby. And, once we've been charged and jeopardy attaches, we can never be charged with those crimes again. You're our 'get out of jail free' card on every crime you testify to.&#34;<br /><br />There is always a tradeoff in writing for entertainment - television or film - between technical accuracy and the need to avoid hopelessly confusing the audience or boring them to death. Where compromising technical accuracy (having an indictment follow an arrest by hours or days instead of the weeks or months it would take in real life, severely streamlining trial proceedings, etc.) moves the plot forward and is justifiable. [This is also true with the medical aspects of the show, such as when Jackson's girlfriend, an M.D., stitches up serious gunshot and knife wounds that would, in real live, require major surgery.] But, for things not necessary to move the plot other than for the writer's convenience, you can't just make it up. At some point, you have to be accurate. They could have made Opie look like a &#34;rat&#34; without creating an obvious bribery defense. [Just as, hopefully, they won't have the doctor girlfriend suddenly come up with a miracle cure for lung cancer to save Opie's father.]<br /><br />So, SOA is great entertainment. Just check your brain at the door.
B0020PJJHS|5.0|There have been a slew of James Bond films over the years, and several actors who have portrayed the legendary gentleman spy. Some more forgettable than others, and most Bond fans have their own personal favorite Bond actor. Pierce Brosnan is mine, and this particular film is my favorite of the entire franchise.<br /><br />Not only is this the best Brosnan bond film, but in my opinion the best Brosnan film to date.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Golf is a tough sport to make a movie about. This movie is the exception.Golfers will love it.<br />the fact that it's a true story is remarkable. If you love sports movies or movies in general this is a gem!
B0039NJTLQ|5.0|Good movie. Good drama. Good story line. I really liked it. Makes me not forget what our troops go through out there and their families go through.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It disgusts me that the USA does nothing to end this. This book awakened me. Brought me to tears. And most importantly has moved me to action. Bravo.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I love this show!  I am always looking for more good Brit tv to watch and I have been truly delighted by this series.  The characters are great.  So strong.  They carry the story through so well.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|when the pacifier came in i thought the monkey would be a little bigger. the monkey on this thing is small....all in all it will go perfect with my monkey based basket for my friends baby shower...i gave the four stars because i was very disappointed in the size of the plush.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|Fun game, and the story kept me engaged.  Loved the potential ending.  Looking forward to playing part 2!  Thank you :-)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really gets your mind thinking.  The game that thinks out of the box.  If you like hidden puzzles you will love this..........with a twist.
B00511ONPG|5.0|After being out of the marketing scene for ten years, Kerpen's book was just what I needed to catch up with the latest strategies in online marketing.  After this crash course in social media I feel prepared to promote my company on these platforms.
B00DJWV11I|4.0|Emma Chase is genius for writing the book from the angle she did. Not overly filled with sex scenes and lots of good banter from the narrator. He draws you in from the beginning with his story. If you want a good laugh and a fun story line with your Romance, read this book.<br /><br />I've only given it 4 stars because I have to wait for the 2nd Part.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Has a nice story to go with the movie, I have it in tape waiting to change it to DVD, I say buy it.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This game stinks. I hated everything. Nothing was good. Worst app ever.<br /><br />P. S.<br />Those were lies. Lots and lots of lies.
031623480X|5.0|The research behind it was compelling and convincing that grain is a huge culprit in our western-culture diet.  I tried the diet for a couple days and didn't miss the carbs at all.  What I did miss was the fiber; evidently I wasn't eating nearly enough vegetables to compensate for the loss of whole grain fiber in my diet.  I lost three pounds in a couple days despite the fact that I wasn't &#34;regular.&#34;  I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to take charge of his/her health.  Now, more than any time in history, we certainly don't want to be dependent upon our government-run health care system to keep us well.  Just one caveat: it was a bit of struggle to get past his views on evolution.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King does it again! He draws you in and weaves an amazing story. I didn't like the ending at first but the more I think about it the more I think that Danny Torrance is deserving of the ending he got. Great story!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|This movie is as terrifying as any Zombie scenario. The people who &#34;turn&#34; are every bit as vicious as any other zombie and driven to convert everyone. Pitt's objective is, at first, to discover the source and find a possible cure for the quickly spreading disease. As the movie progresses, it becomes apparent that all he can do is seek a way to save those are not yet &#34;turned&#34;. That's not a spoiler since every Zombie film since the dawn of film has been about just that - how to survive and simply dispose of the infected.<br /><br />World War Z is a combination of fast action and slow paced investigation. You'll be terrified as the zombie attacks progress. An you'll be relieved by the end of the movie - if you have not already turned....

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it it is fun lots of updates me and my family love it is the best tri this amazing game
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|Adore You: 5/5, My favorite song on the album.<br />We Can't Stop: 5/5, One of the best songs of the Summer.<br />SMS (Bangerz): 4.5/5, This song is a bit messy, but it's really fun! Britney's voice sounds very fierce here.<br />4x4 feat. Nelly: 5/5, This song has a very apparent country influence. It's very different.<br />My Darlin': 5/5, This would be my favorite song on the album sans Future. The lyrics are beautiful and Miley's voice sounds incredible.<br />Wrecking Ball: 5/5, Beautiful song.<br />Love Money Party: 4/5, I love the chorus!<br />#Getitright: 3/5, This song is okay. It's not bad, but it's not great either. I usually skip it.<br />Drive: 5/5, One of my favorites. I love the lyrics and the beat.<br />FU: 4.5/5, Really fun song! Miley's voice sounds really great here.<br />Do My Thang: 4/5, Great beat.

B00992CF6W|3.0|DO NOT DOWNLOAD. I tryed to download it for my 8 year old daughter and. it di not work at all.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was pure vintage King, as you will see.  He weaves horror, humor, and pure evil into a great read.  I mean, haven't you ever wondered what happened to little Danny Torrance?
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|Got to really pay attention when you first watch it or you won't understand the movie . Tom Cruise was good in this movie . Must see if you like sci-fi.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I would recommend this book to others, who are interested in getting healthy and folks who can not digest wheat.
B00F5FBE82|5.0|I love everything on this album. I have never been disappointed by drake. Make sure this is the album you get outta the three Amazon sells of this album.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Broadchurch Season 1 is terrific drama, extremely well written and acted.  To begin, a 9-year-old boy is found dead. The leisurely pace in early episodes makes the viewer feel he knows people just like those in the cast. By the final episode, a flashback to events leading up to the crime enables the viewer to know who committed it.  The final 15 minutes is particularly moving, as the effects of the case on a small-town community are laid bare.  David Tennant's Scottish accent alone is worth the price of admission.  I would recommend Broadchurch to anyone who is interested in relationships among people, shown here to be vital to good drama and universal among cultures.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Such a wonderful adventure and breath-taking moments, and one feels they are there in the midst of it all.  It is something I will enjoy watching many times, even knowing the story, because there is so much to see and explore.
B009NX1YT6|5.0|I've always liked this movie and I think Olivia Newton-John is great. The team up with John Travolta really works.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Good robot fight action, good plot and theme. Would like to see a sequel if anyone comes up with one. Good movie. I recommend it to all audiences.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was a very moving and inspiring story based on fact.  Anyone who thinks that times are rough now should read this.  It is amazing what the human spirit can endure and also to believe such cruelty to children can exist. However, in many cases there  was also a breath of kindness. The great numbers of children, in the thousands was astounding.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I just love this program.  It is easy to use and gives me more space on my phone to download more apps.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. A must if you 've already eead the first two books. Especially loved the epilogue! !
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|The ride down the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon and beyond is extremely interesting and beautiful.  But the use of the river now and the fact that it no longer flows to the ocean shows our need to stop and think how to properly use our rivers
0525953728|5.0|This is a great read. I got several copies and sent them to my kids and gave one or two copies to the neighbors. This is a great story, and very exciting. It dispels all the myths of the Washington politicos who  you can't believe.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|it was real good and kept you guessing. Even when you think you know who, or what, guess again. Well played.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|The quality of the writing and story lines continue.  I miss the characters that leave, but can't wait to see what happens next!
B004742Y68|5.0|A classic.  You can scare people without blood and guts splattered everywhere.  It's hard to find a PG scary movie and this is one.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|I was highly skeptical of this at first, but then decided to try it.  The test results were eye opening and the feedback given is very helpful in laying out a path for action. Anyone interested in discovering and putting your strengths to work would benefit much from reading this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy that I can play on my kindle. I just love this game. So happy so happy.
B00340LM8C|3.0|Good old movie. I enjoyed the plot Sound was a little &#34;old&#34; but considering when the movie was made it was good
B008K9SG9K|5.0|A great CD to listen to when stuck  in traffic or just driving around. Just remember to turn up the volume.
0061906220|5.0|We really the Pete the Cat books and this is no exception. My son (3) quickly picked up on the fun (and good moral) to this story. It's a winner!
B00FVS3RZQ|2.0|My husband, son and I watched it together. We all hated Daryl's hair. It isn't true to the show theme and he looks like he's about to audition for American Idol instead of the badda$$ his character normally is. I hope the hair color and style changes as the season progresses. Also, there were too many new characters thrown at us. I will continue to buy episodes. For now.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book! I loved the characters, loved the story!  I hated to put it down and I couldn't wait to get back to read it at night when I have my reading time.  The ending is so intense and perfectly written.  You won't be disappointed!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|9 times out of 10 sequels are iffy... this one is not one of them... this is one of the best sequels to come out in a long time, but then Stephen King is a master of sequels (Dark Tower series and all the other intertwined books)... this book was not totally unpredictable, but the unexpected twists and turns are great and it really does follow what Danny's life would (could) have been like.  I'm very happy that Stephen King let us catch up with Danny, whom we have wondered about for many years...
B0026QC0TA|3.0|This is a great story played out by an incredible cast of famous actors. However, the storytelling fails to engage the viewer and  stir the human passions in them as the book clearly intends!
B007XHWROK|5.0|A young peoples jam, kids and teen just love to sing his songs it's pretty amazing listening to 5 and 6 years old singing while being driven around.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down! A beautifully written story of 2 young people trying to make the best of the lives they have been given and falling sweetly in love along the way.
B00000IMYA|5.0|An absolute must in any Ellington collection. Indeed the Gonsalves solo in Crescendo and Diminuendo in Blue is unique. Also the booklet gives valuable information on the circumstances under which the band played.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a blast...I know MY granddaughter will LOVE this too!!! I can't wait to share this with her.
B005H9B44A|4.0|This movie has a good mixture of story and action.  Those interested in Marvel stories will enjoy watching the movie Thor.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've read almost all of Stephen King's books over the years, and Doctor Sleep was among the best! He still has the gift, he can still tell a story, his fans won't be disappointed. This is Stephen King the way we all know him!<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is a sequel to The Shining. Someday I hope there will be another sequel, so we will know what happens to Abra! Until then, I will assume she learns to live with her 'gift', and has a normal life.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A truly outstanding job of portraying little Danny Torrence's life as an adult.  Very few books are written that keep your undivided attention on literally every page.  This is one of those books.  To say it is &#34;riveting&#34; is an understatement !
B00DCRE7M0|5.0|This album might be even better than Static Impulses. This is James Labrie to the N. Get ready to Rawwwwk!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This file Explorer makes it possible to navigate your device rather than being forced to use the default interface.  If you want to put something onto a phone or tablet from your PC, you will most likely need this program to find it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good sequel to the Shining..like how it unfolds nice and slow. Evil once again has a name from the writer.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|A must to read book for those who are health conscious and would like to separate the myth from the facts about a number of issues such as cholesterol, statin, Alzheimer's and impact of gluten in the cognitive abilities of individuals.
0470185317|5.0|Information concise and well illustrated. Got the answers of my difficulties with FPGA programming. Go straight at the practice with simple approach.  Need more examples of programming.
0061537969|5.0|A friend purchased this book for NE and i honestly resisted reading it for about a year as we had just lost two of our dogs in recent years. But I finally picked it up because it was haunting me.<br /><br />I started it yesterday and finished it today as tears rolled down my face. Not out of sadness but out if the magic that the story teller tells. Enzo is not just remarkable. He is amazingly frank, warm, and loving. The author has forever changed the way I look at any animal. His incredible writing style just drew me into the story with such ease. The plot took on twists that I never expected. But isn't that what a great author does?<br /><br />It's clearly one of my favorite reads now for the humanity it has brought to me. Lovely, lovely book!
B003VANOFY|1.0|No, range is bad. Mic makes a stupid noise when you turn it on. Battery life is short buttons don't always work. Would not recommend to anyone.
B00DW1WR14|2.0|I never thought it would be possible for me to write a two star review of one of my favorite bands but here it is. Backspacer was one of my favorite albums of the last 10 years and maybe my favorite PJ album ever. So of course it is with great anticipation did I pre-ordered lightning bolt And what am I stuck with? Yeah It's sort of painful.<br />For The first time I have absolutely no interest in what any of the songs are about and that is because there are NO HOOKS!! There is no thunder to draw me into the storm. The chord progressions feel bland and obligatory and when they try to be catchy it's plain cheesy... Like ear piercing cheese.<br />I know this is a band that even when they are making a bad album play phenomenal and I would never argue with the person who found something to love in this album. For myself, I have to say that it is a pretty serious disappointment especially considering the tightness and inspired songwriting of backspacer. I'd say by most bands standards, these songs are tremendously uninspired and the chord changes feel inevitable and rushed. I get none of the colors or emotional triggers of previous albums, nor do I feel they have broken ground in any of their genres. Even the ukulele song that he plays sounds like \\"a man you'll soon forget\\" from binaural (Which was my least favorite PJ album until I heard this one)<br />I still have love for Pearl Jam but I found myself making faces and even repulsed noises and skipping ahead to the next song as it's listening to the previous track would give me hives.<br />Eddie Vedder has some great moments and I agree with some of the reviews that said that his singing is in top form... But I just wish the songs that he was singing were better.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I loved this book! It kept me involved until the very end. Highly recommend! Great mix of mystery and a love story.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I finished this book in one day, barely putting it down to eat. The plot unfolded in just such a way that there was no good time to take a break. Tough subject, yes. And our heroine can be obnoxiously self-absorbed at times, but all in all, it was a truly fantastic story.
B006LSZECO|4.0|A great read. I live the way Flynn writes characters where there is no classic hero, because the protaganist has darkness and ugliness just like most humans. The twists are great, and the story is suspenseful and shocking. I don't like the end but it captured my attention until the last word.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I purchased this book based on the subject matter.  I had heard of Orphan Trains in passing but didn't know anything more about them or the process these children were subjected to once they arrived in the mid-west.  Although the story is a work of fiction, I could envision much of it as having actually happened. It is actually two stories that overlap. The characters felt very real to me and I was drawn to their plight.  As I learned later, there were many children placed on Orphan Trains. Some were lucky, some were not. I recommend reading this book.
B00632HWOG|5.0|A Yahoo mail app from Yahoo, its just what you'd expect, works just as well, if not better than the website interface. I use this App on my phone, tablet, and Kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I watched the movie first, big mistake! I am so glad that I finally broke down and bought the book! This is by far one of the best stories I have ever read, and I LOVE the fact that I could get the kindle edition on my iPhone.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|All in all I thought it was pretty good movie. Nothing to write home about.<br />If your a tracky you will injoy it!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I enjoyed this series. Too bad they stopped after season 2.  Maybe they could of used a better looking Terminator.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I had this on my iPod touch and was very dissapointed with other solitaire games. This one is the easiest to play
B00F4PM6WG|5.0|Perfect set for a 2-3 year old.  Lots of choices for track set up, so the child can use his/her imagination.  Plenty of Lego people, bricks, track, and wheels.
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|if you like romance, action, thriller, drama, comedy, deep understanding messages in the movie that guides the soul to the lighter path.. this is the series for you.. in fact a lot of Star Trek helped me find my moral compass, surprisingly.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is a excellent game to make your mind work... Starting out not very hard it doesn't take long before you find some that make you really think to figure it out... Almost reminds you of a maze but in a different way.. You decide which way to connect the pipes without crossing each other...
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|I thought this was a very good movie with great special effects. A bit dragged out but very good!<br />I did recommend this to a friend.
B00122OQ3W|5.0|For sure Cat Stevens best music is recorded here and his best Album, &#34;Year of the Cat&#34;<br /><br />Brings back so many thoughts and memories from when I was a very young teenager and the summer it was released. Very moving, almost like looking at old pictures, so many thoughts come to mind and feelings about what I was doing and thinking at the time, all coming together to produce a smile and deep reflection of those times.<br /><br />Excellent music, a must to have for anyone of good taste and the age to remember when it was first played on the AM radio prior to FM music.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|I like this one but it sometimes will fail your level.  Not sure if this is a game flaw or user flaw.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I always enjoy Grisham books, and this was no different.  You can't go wrong with John Grisham books.  Enjoy - it's a page turner.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King brings back the little boy Danny from &#34;The Shining&#34; and it's a great horror story of addiction, hospices and a cult that drives RV's and live forever. The shining exists in Dan (Danny is grown up) and a young girl with a connection to Dan. The True Knot is some real scary people and it takes a terrific amount Shining and deception to beat them. This is the best book Stephen King has written in a long time of mediocre stuff.  It's not &#34;The Stand&#34; or &#34;The Talisman&#34; but it's a real good read anyhow.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is great for anymore who has read the Percy Jackson series, or anyone who wants to read a very well written book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game because it was challenging enough to play and play it over and over again. I think you all would love Subway surfers!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I can't wait to get home and watch episode 1 of season 4! This made me so excited to get back into it!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Nice break from the normal games and no pressure to send gifts or play everyday.  Good for a sit and relax game as long as you aren't too competitive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One word.........wow<br />This is a awesome game gets five stars<br /> thnx to my cousins uncooked on.  This game doesn't take long to Load and only skipps if u detract to  many animals on  One world.<br />M
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|My grandchildren have already spent many enjoyable minutes playing Granny Smith.  I enjoy hearing their giggles and exclamations of pride as they complete levels.  My twin grandsons were helping each other progress through the game.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie because it was fun, exciting and kept my attention. My husband loved it too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so happy they finally got this game. I no longer have to play it on my phone !
B00BAXFAOW|1.0|I've read all of Gladwell's previous books, and found them to be highly enjoyable. As such, I pre-ordered D&G; I had very high hopes for this text, and I was let down with a resounding thud. The writing doesn't flow very well, and is highly redundant from section to section. Also, while I understand that Gladwell is not making his points through the rigors of hard science, some of his stories had such obvious flaws and valid counterarguments that it was insulting to my intelligence. I made it through 100 pages and finally gave up - I found nothing in those first 100 pages to be worthwhile. A disappointing effort from a gifted story teller.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|No more Iron Man movies. Please or give Iron Man a real villain to fight..a ass kicker....how about a Black Widower like Bat Man's Poison Ivy....delicious.
B00EAIMGDW|2.0|Like a point and click adventure without the adventure. Nothing interesting about this except the presentation. Much rather play stealth bastard..
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Ready to follow cross through another book!!  I absolutely love these two and hope they find happiness and less drama after the next book!  Sylvia Day, you are amazing!!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|Harry Potter books were my favorites and the movies really follow the stories which is unusual. I am so happy to have purchased this movie.

B0045EJY90|4.0|Without a doubt this is a good unit, it wasn't until I received it that I found it was not a recorder per say, there is no line in only a line out which didn't fill my need.  I returned this in favor of the RW890 as it is a true CD recorder with line in and out.  My only issue is the wording in the add gave me the impression it was able to record and in a sense it does but only from a USB source.  Amazon quickly corrected the issue and I continue to buy from Amazon, their service is the best!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Terrific special effects. It makes you feel like you could just jump into the action. Even much better than the movies.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've waited for what seemed like forever for this game to come to kindle fire. THANK YOU, I'm so addicted
B00FPH3YQA|2.0|the movie keep reloading 4-times and was not unjoyable at all one time it said to try later on, is something wrong with your serve?.
B00ARA4SLU|5.0|Hopkins is outstanding as Alfred Hitchcock in this role! If you love Hitchcock and/or the movie Psycho, you will LOVE this movie! So interesting. I had no idea what went into the making of the film & what a big deal it was at the time. Great movie, especially if you're a bit of a hollywood history buff.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this album!!! There isn't one big standout song, which means everybody can have their own favorite, and I think that's a sign of a good album.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|clint eastwoood, what can i say. he makes everything looks so classy. makes the movie enjoyable and fun to watch with family.
B007XF0X16|5.0|I love this movie. The special effects are fantastic and it looks great. I would totally recommend this movie on Blu Ray to anyone who considers himself to be an FX lover. Thumbs up!
B004GJDQT8|5.0|As a store front it works fine. Straight forward simple design. Easy to find products and make purchases. No dislikes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this was a pretty nice game.  could not stop playing once I started.  and I felt that each room was increasingly challenging.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Purchased this item for a gift for a relative who enjoys this film enough to watch it on cable at any time that she finds it running. This is a good film with out zombies, aliens or ninjas if your looking for a \\"nice \\" entertaining story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for this to be available on Kindle.  A simple, but very addictive game.  Graphics and challenge of solving the puzzles is well architected.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great product at a fantastic price.<br /><br />Easy to setup and use, we all use it at home. I love not to change the input source on the TV when I want to use chromecast.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|I have always been a fan of Drizzt,but started reading deep into the collection. Now I see how it started and how it started and how it became so popular. Thank you, I will own the whole thing!
B005OGS854|5.0|this is a fabulous movie our family had to have and the price could not be beat! arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect condition. we watch the movie over and over and over again an do not have any problems.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Awesome show! Love the suspense and the storyline. Feels like I know them. All the seasons are great. Highly recommended!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Kindle version of Facebook is just simply inferior to the iPhone mobile app.  Am not going to buy an iPad, however, just to be able to have a better FB interface on my tablet.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|Easy,great graphics and interesting story.Fun to play with great puzzles to solve,not to difficult,interesting characters. Please create more games like this!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A positive approach to spiritual wisdom, unending family support and love.  I highly recommend this warm, uplifting memoir sharing how to find true contentment and happiness  after experiencing tragedy and grave sickness.

B0013D8LOK|5.0|this is the most surprisingly good movie ever. if you have not seen it please dont let the cover fool you you will fall in love with this movie the more times you watch it the more you understand what they are all doing so fabulous to accomplish. my experience with this seller was nothing short of stellar! the movie was sent in lightening speed, arrived far before i expected it too, was in great condition, we watch it over and over and over again and there are no problems with this dvd. everything from this company was exceptional and i would choose them first for any other purchases next time
B008Y6YCB0|5.0|Although slightly different from the book, the acting in this portrayal is charming, and the feel of the story very fun.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|This is an awesome new release by Sir Elton John.  His voice sounds as strong as ever, and the music it great.  It's good to finally have another solo album from Elton.  As a die hard fan nearly 40 years this album didn't disappoint, I've been listening to it non stop since I got it.  A must have for all Elton fans young and old.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|Are you sick of remakes? What about continually worsening sequels? This movie is incredibly enjoyable both from it's originality (cutthroat ballet??) and non-stop wonderment. It's difficult to get to detailed without blowing the whole thing but this made my bride-to-be and me both look at each other when it was finished, and say, &#34;WOW!&#34;. Talked about it for a few days. Just a fantastic movie.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I feel that this is a fine portrayal of the value of Life Universally, very heartwarming, is a very beautiful concept and visualization in Science Fiction as a genre.  It is a classic.
B008RZF2I0|5.0|I love all Kamelot albums, and I was nervous when Roy left because his voice is so beautiful.<br />It's true that Kamelot has become darker in tone over the years, but the music remains amazing.<br />Tommy has a great voice, no he's not Roy, and that is ok because he is really, really, good.<br />I ordered this CD recently and I am enjoying it.<br />Buy it!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Chose this headset thanks to famous streamer &#34;PhantomLord&#34;.<br />Battery is pretty okay (full, I can play all day without charging it), and the station is pretty useful.<br />I'm just disappointed that you can't enjoy the 7.1 on Mac OS X, but as we say, Mac isn't for gaming.<br /><br />I'm just a bit disappointed on the USB receptor, which is pretty fragile. The USB part actually separate itself from the rest of the key, and I had to plug it back, which make the receptor fragile (This is why I don't put 5 stars on it).<br /><br />Otherwise, a really good device, handy and easy to instal/use. Do recommend!
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|As I sit here mourning the loss of this precious and most beautifully written book and its characters that I couldnâ(tm)t help but fall in love with as âaeAuthor Christoph Fischerâ poignantly express with words and the greatest depth of emotional History albeit fictional, but History all the same. Iâ(tm)m reminded that one of my majors in school was history and just like then I passionately devoured each and every word, sentence, paragraph, chapter and pageâ¦â¦ I was drawn in and held captivated by the main characters familia âaeThe Weissensteinerâ(tm)sâ. A Jewish family, who at the start of this incredibly amazing read has already experienced a migration from their once known lands and the loss of their mother and for Jonah their father, his wife and companion. Life was hard and meager, but the family which consist of two daughterâ(tm)s Greta and Wilma, Egon a son and Jonah their father enjoyed and made the best of it.<br /><br />They were Jews in name only. The unfortunate circumstances of their lifeâ(tm)s journey to this point has lead them to this decision and made them somewhat outcast amongst their Jewish community. They were Christians by choice but didnâ(tm)t practice this self made choice of religions either. The Weissensteinerâ(tm)s were quiet and hardworking and enjoying their life as is. The eldest daughter Greta, an avid reader spent most of her free time outside of her daily responsibilities reading and one day through this met her future destiny. This will begin the story of a life altering and historically epic journey that will test their resolve and expose their lives to many dangers, friends, enemies and eye opening atrocities. Blessed with luck or as I like to see it âaeThe Blessings of Godââ¦.. They will endure, accept, let go and live a life of Blessings in the midst of great turmoil. A close knit Jewish family which find themselves in the throes of a war torn Europe. This included Germany, Russia, and Czechoslovakia, Ukrainian, Hungarian and many more countries. âaeThe entire war of the Hitler eraâ<br /><br />I loved the authorâ(tm)s attention to detail through each and every historic moment, history and background of the characters. You will laugh, love, cry, grieve, embrace, hate and mourn some more.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|These new Start Trek movies are so much fun to watch.Chris Pine is a perfect Captain Kirk,but not as cheesy as you-know-who in the original!And the making of background info is fun to watch,along with the bloopers!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Yet another great book from Brandon Sanderson. Already read it twice. At this rate his going to turn into my favorite author. Please enjoy.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|Imagine an awesome Ship-sim like FTL but with more detailed missions and crew control and an isometric view.<br />So far it doesn't seem nearly as Rogue-like as I would have preferred (as FTL most certainly is), but this game is definitely one of the best games available on Kindle Fire.
0811879542|5.0|A wonderfully simple yet creative book for toddlers.  I love the way the dots respond to the commands given on the previous page.  Very unique.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|easy enough for me to navigate means it's real easy!!! Can set multiple alarms.<br />love this app. love waking to \\"THE CUP SONG\\" from Pitch Perfect. ;-D.
0385737955|5.0|This is definitely a page turner with a riveting storyline, and it will keep you guessing about the purpose of the maze. I'd recommend it for older teens to adults due to some more intense, tragic and gruesome scenes. I bought this for my 15 year old and he had a hard time putting it down. As soon as he finished he wanted to get the rest of the series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I honestly with my whole heart loved this book!! I loved the connection between Holder and Sky!! Amazingly written about hope, survival and love!! Simply amazing!!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|got this for my husband for Christmas and we have watched all of season, starting on season two.  great gift.
B00CCXL9OE|5.0|My girls have watched it everyday since it arrived and the singing in the house now is adorable, such a good buy
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is THE REAL Candy Crush Saga. This game is very addictive and can be very challenging. I highly recommend downloading this game. It is best for you to have a Facebook account but is not needed to play.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|A lot of fun to watch! I laughed out loud several times! A great combination of interesting characters that are more compelling as a team.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Read half the book. This is the most shallow story I have ever read. No redeeming qualities whatsoever. The plot, if you can call it that, is so trite, yet so unreal, that it is just juvenile. Sorry I bought this thing.
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I got this through the Humble Bundle and it was a surprisingly fun management game. Updates have fixed several of the early bugs and weird design choices. Totally worth the money.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Very cool device but wish I could stream my Amazon instant videos and push pictures and videos in my private cloud to the device. I see loads of potential but only netflix, hulu plus and you tube apps are available.  Had issues connecting my router but after I updated the firmware it worked perfectly.<br /><br />Just need more apps now.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Very boring--deleted it after only a few minutes of play.  One coin just keeps pushing and nothing else happens.  Dull
B000002MY3|5.0|Hands down, one of the best albums out there. Worth purchasing every note. Every woman should have a copy of this in her car!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Really loving PJ's lyrics lately. Even though they mellowed out a bit, each song has deep meaning. PJ is like a fine wine, just keeps getting better with age!
B004VUP8LG|4.0|first, I have given this many many listens, the first 3 listens were \\" im not sure I like this \\" After many more listens, and having this play in the background, its not that bad, I really like it, YES, its not your typical Altars Of Madness perfection, but this is astill pretty good. It is not 1985 amy more, although i wish metal still sounded as such. This album is still pretty good.<br />It is different...very much so, with some hip hop beats i guess one could say, but its no different that their old Liabach remixes, and the remixes by say, Malevolent creation on the Joe Black Ep. Sure its off the beaten path of their old stuff, but it is 2013 , and this is a damn good album.<br />Just give it some time. The song structures are not the best, but, it is well produced, and deserves a listen if your a fan of metal. Ministry, KMFDM, comes to mind a bit. Still...I like this, and still spin this pon a regular basis. METAL FOREVER !
B008JFUP8A|5.0|Okay, I just watched this movies in spite of the thousands of bad reviews that I read. Frankly I do not understand why people hate this movie unless it is pure jealousy based on the director or actors, who by the way did a great job. I saw a coming of age story about a young man who was traumatized as a kid, an absentee dad(no matter the reason)and a chance for them to not only find themselves but also find each other. The story is set in a post apocalyptic future (so what?) it doesn't make the story less poignant or interesting.<br /><br />Jaden Smith may be getting roles that many feel are being given him based on who his father is, Drew Barrymore got roles cause she was a product of an acting dynasty, and many other young stars today have famous parents you just don't know it because they use different last names, yet you people don't dismiss them out-of-hand. Jaden is a good actor and so is his father. The baldwins, the sheens and many other acting families have done the same for their children, yet where is the peanut gallery. The truth is some of them could not act their way out of a paper bag yet they get accolades for mediocre work.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you watch this movie without prejudice and them you will see what I saw, a great tale told by a visionary and acted by seasoned professionals
B008OOYALE|4.0|Kaylabear725 in need of neighbors please add me, great game! We can send each other gold and i am in of mystic Map, please help
B0000542D1|4.0|It was good in its time and still is to those who love the Beatles. Its a piece of history that should be seen from generations to come.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I like the game best on the computer but it's great on my kindle and would like candy crush and more for the kindle cause the phone is so small, I like bigger screens to play on
B006LSZECO|2.0|Maybe too many married couples hate each other and i just do not understand why they continue to torment one another but I could not get into this book.  All i could think of was how awful twenty four hours a day for years to come with hate in your hearts was too much.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|Liane is very good at getting inside characters heads and letting us know what they are thinking, which I like. I also found myself laughing quite a bit. I would read another book by her. This story had an interesting twist, but over all I would say it was sort of depressing and the story just kind of moves along without a lot of thrill.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my sister and it is awesome! We just love this story and the DVD really brings it to life in an absolutely beautiful way.
0893860468|5.0|This book can be hard to read because it is so honest. But If you stay with it found it to be very inspiring.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|The characters' back stories were xtremely generic and not well developed. Also the acting was very subpar. Very minimal entertainment value, especially for a two hour movie.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Great game for pasting time just wish that they would do a update to where you can get gold coins for more then just leveling up and wish that the power bar fills up faster but over all great game
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|It won't scare you silly, but the story is a good solid one. I love Stephen King, and I think he is at his best when he is exploring characters that dance on a different plane of existence. In this story the adversaries to our protagonists elicit some sympathy since they have some very mortal qualities. I suspect we have not heard the last of them.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|I'm not overly fond of zombie movies or Brad Pitt but I will say this movie did them both justice.  This was as good as any action movie and the use of zomebies was just the catalyst.  It was handled well and very believable (as zombies go) and the plot was very good.  I was suprised that I like any movie featuring Brad Pitt and zombies.  Good job.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a funny and feel-good book that for anyone that likes Romance will really enjoy.  I really enjoyed reading this book and finished it in one day.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|This is a mini-series which can be watched again and again.  A pastor who has lost his faith moves his daughter and wife from an agricultural economy to the busy life of an industrial town where there are cotton mills.  Evident throughout  are the hazards, such as child labor, long hours, physical and mental abuse,and dangerous conditions, of working in cotton mills where fabric is created from raw cotton.  And yet  it is a slowly developing love story.  .
B003WJQ74E|5.0|This was phenomenal yet easy read. Following persons life, good and bad, provides amazing character development and an ability to sympathize
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Good so far. Happy to see the Shining story continue, I've finished the first chapter or two so far. Reading Kindle version.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love these books! I have read these books at least 3 times now. I keep recommending friend who haven't read them to read them.
B009C7JS14|4.0|It seems to be pretty accurate. I will keep checking it, though, to make sure it stays accurate for me.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|takes to muck space but overall good games but can u not make it aquier so much space thank you
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Enjoyed it the first time, I will read it again.  I would consider this one of the better Stephen King books.
B004FPZ2FE|4.0|Though not my favorite, I consider it another one of her great novels. The added hunor was refreshing yet unexpected from Austen.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|i installed it and it worked without any problems.  I have not used it much yet but would recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Although it has been a while since reading this book,<br />I am still thinking about it. Certainly not a happy ending<br />for very many of the characters, but is that what Hosseini<br />is trying to tell us about the current situation?
1451673442|3.0|I think the advice is good and we all need to develop better attitudes and  ways to monitor our negative thoughts.  I still believe there needs to be action to go with the appreciation in your heart.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It was King that prevented Candy Crush from being available on Kindle, not Amazon.  Now that I have downloaded it from the app store, I'm sorry I didn't leave well enough alone and stick with the \\"side-loaded\\" one I had, since you have to wait for it to download every time you want to play.  The 3 stars reflects that annoying aspect.  The game itself is great and 5 stars.<br /><br />After posting the above, everything started working normally.  Therefore, I have amended my rating to 5 stars.  Game loads fine and there is no wait time.  The only issue I see now is that I only seem to be getting one \\"gift life\\" at a time, not the total amount that I have waiting for me from friends.  Perhaps this, too, will work itself out.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This book is a total gem!!!!  It gave me insight into what busking was about and that it actually was work.  More importantly, is the relationship between James and Bob.  There is total loyalty and love here.  We have a therapy cat who has done wonders for us.  We also work at the local animal shelter and see the love that cats bring so many people.  I have recommended the book to everyone I see.  Those who have read it agree that it's an exceptional book.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|A delightful story of the chatter of love in our minds when we hope and dream of familiar feelings of the past!  I had to read it with a British accent in order to relate to it.  The sentences are early English style, so I had to read it more contextually than word for word.  I loved the story!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Love the way he goes into the life story of each character and then ties them all together. It gives you a deep understanding of his story.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|This movie isn't as bad as all the reviews would leave one to believe. It is cheesy with bad cgi, don't get me wrong, but its entertaining. I liked it.
B0055D3EOG|2.0|I'm so puzzled by the many 4 and 5 star reviews on this film. It felt like a movie I should have watched for free on Lifetime. The actors were not believable, and some of the ghosts seemed spooky but the devil dude looked so stupid, like he was wearing a WWF mask. The visit by the paranormal team was so cheeseball, they were trying to be funny, took any sort of spooky ambience away from the film. I actually think this could have been really, really scary as the premise was there. It was just so poorly executed.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|One of the best Christmas movies available.  This should be on your list even if it is Christmas in July!
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Steelheart was a fun, quick, read. While it reminded me of Joseph Michael Straczynski &#34;Rising Stars&#34;, I greatly enjoyed it. I liked the ending and I'm looking forward to reading more stories in the Steelheart Universerse.
B00C7AXJMW|5.0|A fitting end to the trilogy! Part prequel, this story illuminates some of the most interesting characters from the previous books. Well worth the read - intelligent speculative fiction about an all too possible future.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|This is a great movie, very 'feel good'. The characters are fantastic and Edward Nortorn is always amazing behind a screen.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|This is a must have for your collection. It really makes you think of what would you do if you where in that situation with cerebral palsy kid, a new born and facing cancer at the same time.  You would use those skills for sure, to your advantage. A must have for the fan!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Excellent most informative , interesting,enjoyable reading. Good suggestions. Referred to this area by my Dtr she frequently access the data.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Simply the best queen of the night ever by Diana Damrau. We'll directed and good choreography. The supporting actors very good.
0446541478|3.0|I have read half the book so far. As said in other comments, it could be just like 120 pages long or so. There is a lot of content you can easily skip. I feel there is a lot of masturbation as well, with ideas like \\"we are the best\\" \\"we were the first to do this or that\\", \\"we got the right ideas noone else had to build the best processor, and Intel success is entirely due to Israelis\\", \\"we built a completely innovative water irrigation system that noone else thought of before, and all the world is amazed about it and comes to see it\\". I mean bright people come with great ideas in all countries.<br />So far, beside the army thing, I don't really see what explains that Israelis make more startups than others.<br />Israelis are not any smarter than others. As someone else commented, the government policy must be largely to thank. There has to be that the society in general (people, family, employers etc) value and respect those who take great risks with entrepreneurship projects, and failure doesn't necessarily means you are hopeless. In some countries, a failed project might be seen by an employer as nothing more than a hole in your CV.<br />In France, the best education includes spending a year in the army. That idea that a military education just makes you \\"better\\" is not new, it goes back to Napoleon in FR. Good on Israelis that they encourage/oblige locals to service for the army.<br />I'll keep reading till the end still, hoping to see less \\"blabla\\" :)
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Had he been a first time author I would have given five stars. A really good read but not his best.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put it down but didn't want it to end.  Excellent read and better than The Shining!  A must read for any King fan,
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I got this download late as I did not know it was GAGA singing, Good song love way it makes me move!!

0307352153|5.0|Great book.  Silence is golden.  And a sign of brilliance! Also makes a great gift to the loudmouths in your life.
1439148813|5.0|When it comes to the space program, most books focus on the astronauts, but the readers do themselves an incredible injustice by skipping the other 95% of the action. This book covers those heroes. I had always thought of Mission Control as similar to Air Traffic Controllers. If the tower isn't open, planes can still land on their own with a specific set of procedures. But Mission Control is just that - they are as integral to the mission as the astronauts and the rockets - every one of them.<br /><br />For every action of the astronauts - from docking, to EVAs, to even taking a poop, there was someone on the ground whose job it was to worry about that specific aspect of it and how it impacted every other part of the mission. These amazing specialist controllers worked and trained with the primary and the backup astronaut crews to develop the specific procedures for performing every action (potential and planned) the whole team might foreseeably encounter. When it came time to perform those actions, the makeup of the shift of controllers would be the specialists in those areas. So when the action changed from launch to docking rendezvous, the controller shift changed, too.<br /><br />The Apollo 14 mission is one great example. Paraphrasing a chapter, one of the controllers had detected a problem with the ABORT switch. After a quick conference with other specialists, they called a backroom of other experts who was there to specifically back him up. Behind that back room of specialists was a software team from MIT on the line waiting just in case. While the astronauts were preparing and proceeding with their lunar descent, the MIT team had written a software patch, the back room team had tested it with the backup astronaut crew in the SIM and then transmitted to the crew. Without their efforts, the landing would have been scrubbed.<br /><br />As another example, every time the launch was put on hold, there was a trajectory controller who performed the calculations for the new trajectory and upload it to the computers. You have to think, every minute or so means a new trajectory!<br /><br />The Apollo 13 movie only hints at the immense pressure these guys were under. No rocket was perfect and every mission required troubleshooting (and fixing) one set of problems after another. Live. Thanks to Gene for giving these guys their due.<br /><br />Another book that I think of as essential is Deke Slayton's book, \\"Deke!\\" This bridges the gap between astronauts and admin and how many of the decisions were made (such as who was first in space or on the moon).the new trajectory and upload it to the computers.

B00CJKW4WQ|5.0|It is really a great product...<br />Works flawlessly in Mac and windows...<br />And my main work relies heavily on spreadsheets ..<br /><br />A tip : if you need to use it with windows under parallels you have to turn num lock on ( using the virtual keyboard of windows :) )
0156027321|5.0|This beautifully crafted novel covers topics of religion, zoology, botany, basic survival, and human nature.  The allegorical novel presents an intricate story of a boy shipwrecked at sea, and (in the closing pages) reveals information that shatters your perception of his long struggle at sea.  It is worth reading if you have seen the movie and re-reading if you've read it before.  There is much more to this story than meets the eye, and the only way to find out is to pick up the story and dive in.<br /><br />*I would recommend this story to almost all readers.  (Parents beware that there is KILLING described in this book)
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great.  This one is hard to put down. Every time I have an extra minute I read a little bit more.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a blast, creative thinking required!  Good brain neuron therapy for all ages, and that's all I have to say about that.
B006UIUJ2A|4.0|This book not only had a good storyline but also gave a taste of life in North Korea in the camps. The main character was not really likeable but the narrative gave reasons for his actions and the way he thought so as a reader you could sympathise with the situatiions he faced. A very different perspective from the western way we live. We know so little of NorthKorea and the background to the story gave it added interest.

B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I started crying 20 minutes in because I knew how it would end,\\"Rosebud\\" ooops I mean, \\"Daisy\\".<br />DiCaprio will always look like a kid but as soon as he begins performing his looks replace his face he is the character dramatically and subtly as he releases just enough of the underlying craziness of Gatsby to show. He is not the chameleon like Cate Blanchett or Daniel Day Lewis, the amazing thing is he doesn't need to be. Kudos Leonardo!

076115728X|4.0|It's hard trying to rate a child's book, especially a toddler because they are so independent they like what they like and that's that. My daughter is 3 and she likes this book, it is an interactive book to and with a simple word like OOPS she could pick up that word when she saw it threw the book and read it. When I ask her why she likes it she says she likes the mouse.<br /><br />It's a great book for kids, my daughters first reaction to the turned down page was to straighten it up and not turn it back down hehe. She was concerned that someone tore the page on the first page with the tear in it that becomes the crocodiles mouth. I see it more as an adorable book with bright colours and big words than 'teaching' anything.

B0050DIWFC|2.0|This is an easy read, but the story is poorly written. There are several unnecessary cliff hangers, some of which never seem to resolve themselves and many useless descriptive passages, which appear to be a poor attempt at being “literary.“ On the positive side, the story is interesting with twists towards the end and the courtroom dialogue gets your attention.
B00BGN6G4E|4.0|5 women and one man in a metal band. Who would have thought they would sound this good. I hope they continue to product more music.
B004K8WPUQ|5.0|Just a few pointers... its a very good and durable mic if you know how to use it.<br /><br />I know this may sound obvious, but make sure you have a 9V battery to place into the microphone. The battery install and removal cap is a bit annoying to use and that is my only gripe with this item.<br /><br />I have a Nikon D800 and when i first recorded a video it had an annoying &#34;hissing&#34; sound on playback alone with the audio I wanted to record. To get rid of this, you need to go into your Audio Settings (and then Movie setting if you have the D800), and Change the setting from Auto to Manual. Then decrease the input volume settings to about half of what it is set at (I set mine at +7, down from +14). Then turn the Rode Mic to the 2nd On setting (far right) and also set the gain on the Rode mic to +20. This reduced the hissing sound immensely on my video playbacks, but did not completely get rid of it.<br /><br />If you want to completely eliminate the Hissing sound (or not deal with the setting changes mentioned above), you can use a DeNoiser feature in most Video editing software's (thought it may be called by another name).<br /><br />Hope this helps!

B002WV5A9G|4.0|This movie is a retelling of the origins of Captain Kirk, Mr. Spock, and the rest of the Star Trek franchise characters from the original series, and how they came together on the Enterprise. If you love Star Trek, then you’ll probably love this film. It holds up well on its own even as basic science fiction.<br /><br />Chris Pine is a great Captain Kirk, close enough to William Shatner to make it believable without lurching into parody, and Zachary Quinto is an amazing Mr. Spock.<br /><br />Some of the best scenes belong to Leonard Nimoy, reprising his role as the original Mr. Spock. Ironically, Nimoy's appearance is the high point and the biggest problem with the film. The overall tale is comforting and pleasurable, but the movie never goes beyond this. Everything in the story is more about Star Trek and exploring stuff that is old and familiar (with new actors) rather than developing an actual new story with a particular idea or thematic direction.<br /><br />So overall, it’s a good move but not at all a great one. It’s simply enjoyable, a trifle of fun and not anything worthy of great reflection.<br /><br />Star Trek fans note... Since continuity in the &#34;Star Trek universe&#34; is so important to rabid fans, this movie is officially an &#34;alternate timeline&#34; story. What happens here doesn't fit at all with subsequent events in the established Star Trek universe. This is due to time travel at the beginning of the tale. The film's director, J.J. Abram's, used this story technique to detach this movie and subsequent films from the necessity of fitting the Star Trek canon.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book offers an in-depth look at the food industry s tactics. Eye opening and comprehensive account. I thoroughly enjoyed this read.
B00EK0UBPU|5.0|It must be hard to construct a story that is both complex and involved, yet keep you wanting to turn 800 pages to get to the climax.  Eleanor Catton's scholarly research provides an authentic background to a great mystery story.  Highly recommended.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|It gave me the key to many missing links in my own life and helped me process through them so I could find my own freedom.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|&#34;Heart of Courage&#34; is my favorite.  Take this with you on a drive in the mountains, or on an outdoor run.  Uplifting, fantastic, moving.
B005KIQDYE|5.0|Great product...age appropriate...lots of little pieces so not wise to have around small children.  The little girl I bought it for (age 7) loved it!
B00439MV42|4.0|My kids are on a Back to the Future kick and so we have been watching all of the movies.  We started with the first and then watched the second and finally the third.  My kids enjoyed all of them as did the adults.  The one caveat is that the series does include some bad language and some adult themes.<br /><br />Overall, we liked the this movie and found it to be more enjoyable than the second.  The first is a classic and this is a close second.  I strongly recommend it to others looking for fun movies watch with the family.
B004P7CN5O|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT CLASSIC GEORGE CLOONEY VAMPIRE,BLOOD AND GUTS MOVIE WITH.EXCELLENT SEXY DANCING.THE PRICE WAS REASONABLE,THE SHIPPING CONTAINER WAS AT A MINIMUM BUT OK!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Good game. I like that you can come back after awhile and your energy is refilled. The graphics are good and the pictures clear. Recommend it.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|First I wanted to address the guy giving one star on how this isn't Rovio, a simple Google search revield to me, on Rovio's website that Rovio Stars is the new name for their mobile game section now. Now that that's clear... This seems to be a fun game. I played it for a few minutes and can see myself playing it when I need to kill time, just like Angry Birds. Hopefully they'll keep it full of updates and ad-ons like their flagship series.
B00D29CBIU|3.0|I've used EFT in the past and am always looking for more/new information on its application. A few chapters into the book it is well written. Each chapter ends with a suggested video (URL is provided). Going to that URL one must provide an email address which, of course, means offers for over-priced products, seminars, and &#34;live&#34; (they're always pre-recorded) phone events. When I saw the &#34;value&#34; of $997 I shook my head -- this seems to be the favored product price of hucksters like Joe Vitale, et al. I will finish reading the book, but will now do it with a wary eye....
B0045HCJKS|4.0|THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE CLASSIC  IF YOU ARE A YUL BRENNER FAN.THE PRICE WAS FAIR AND THE QUALITY WAS GOOD,THE PACKAGING WAS ADEQUATE,SHIPPING WAS REASONABLE.
B008QPCCQQ|3.0|Love the comprehensive collection of works - old favorites and new ones to explore.  But the navigation is frustrating.  No pages numbers are given in the table of contents or the book itself, and no quick-links to get to individual stories.  So you just have to page through the entire collection until you find the book you want.  Also, no headers or footers or titles to indicate what story you are in as you browse/page through, so it's next to impossible to find a particular story...VERY frustrating and time consuming.
B004S5FWEC|4.0|Enthralled from the first page to the last. Could not put it down, tired the next day at work. Recommended to anyone who enjoys a mistery.
B005R4KUZE|5.0|This is an excellent program to improve tactics.<br />There plenty of easy and hard puzzles.<br />It is useful for both average and strong players.
B00BGV0Y26|5.0|In today's hard rock scene it isn't too often that you come across a band that is led by a woman and it's even more rare that they are as good as Halestorm is. Lzzy is one girl who has the strength to belt it out and the softness to handle the ballads. Love her voice and love this band. They've made a distinct impression on me and made me a fan for life. Keep rockin'.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. I'm new to it. I streamed Season 1 through Season 3 over the last couple months. Halfway through the first episode I was totally hooked. I love the characters and the way they and the story lines develop from episode to episode. It's great to see the clothes and decor and manners from that era and part of the world. Season 3 was heartbreaking though. During the last episode I shouted out loud, &#34;No!!&#34; I think many watchers did the same. How could it be? I was so saddened by the events of the final episode in that season that I just sat there staring into space, and finally just went to bed! Kind of funny to be so into any show that it would have that effect on me, but it did. I'm really looking forward to Season 4.
B000002KAT|5.0|If you don't have this CD in your collection you are missing out on one of the best musical experiences you can have.  Van Morrison pours his whole heart and soul into this record.
B001EC3JME|2.0|My use is for 1\\" diameter by 5\\" long tactical lights which do not protrude out the bottom.  I also tried it with a 2 C cell light which protrudes out the bottom a lot.<br /><br />I was looking for something either with a flap cover or a snug but easy to insert fit.  This is neither.  It has no cover flap, but has a VERY snug fit on this type of light.  However it is made up of a series of internal flaps and elastic straps you have to guide the light through to get it into this case.  You cannot easily do this one handed as you have to spread two internal flaps apart and hold them that way to insert the light.  In addition if you have to sit/stand as in driving patrol or the like, the light works it's way out the top even if it doesn't protrude out the bottom.  Since there is nothing to lock it in, the movement of sitting and moving around when seated pushes against the bottom squeezing the light upward like squeezing a toothpaste tube.  Eventually it pops out the top.  In addition if your light has a tailcap switch it will get turned on without your knowing it in daytime (you would see the light at night), draining the batteries, as there is nothing protecting the tailcap switch from being pressed against the seat bottom.<br /><br />From my experience with it, this is pretty useless if you are going to be wearing it on a belt in the vertical position, whether a short small diameter or longer larger diameter light.  As a temporary worklight holder it isn't bad, but how often do you need a worklight on your belt?
B001SGEUNI|4.0|Halestorm shows great promise. This album while not up to the par of it's successor in my opionion is still a great debut from a great band.
B0012QRPU4|3.0|not compelling story line - acting is good but just not interesting.  Will give it a few more episodes to develop a captivating story and journey that we want to follow.  &#34;Ho-humm' after the first episode.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome, this game has officially made it to kindle! This game is very fun! Lots of my Facebook friends play it =D. I recommend this to everyone looking for fun! :)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|what an amazing story! I've often wondered what happened to the boy from The Shining, and now I know. not to be missed.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this story. I was so sad when it came to an end. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is wonderful. I like the different options, challenges and different scenery. The only thing I would change is how many G coins it takes to revive the minions. A big thanks to whom ever created this.
B009GEYX5E|4.0|Initially when we got this film we tested it out and the first three pictures we took didn't turn out at all. Two were black and the third was very blurry. We were using the Polaroid camera for a 50th wedding anniversary party to have some throw back touches and we were vary worried the pictures would not turn out. But in a well lit room all of our pictures turned out with no problems. We were very happy with this film and we would buy it again.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|could not put it down! Very scary and kept my interest to the very end. Can't wait for the movie.
B000IVW25M|5.0|The first...and the graphics have been cleaned up for this DVD. nice clean edges again and most of the colors look better...Snow White Disney's first.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great product!  Came in original wrap; did not have any blemishes and played without any issues.  Just love the quality!
B006VGGAC4|2.0|No Total Recall here, only beautiful story about success, leaving all the juicy and negative details behind. It is written like self promoting book, over half of the book is about politics, which is more than boring.<br /><br />No details about steroids, only BS like: I tried it but it didn't do anything for me (looks very untrue), nothing about sex life (which seems it was quite big and still is), no details about movies (only stuff you can pick up for free from any internet site).<br /><br />So don't waste your money on self glorifying book. You can find more details and juicy stuff on internet for free
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I've always been fascinated by Hitchcock. I saw the movie Pschyco  when I was a young girl and it still scares me.  I enjoyed this movie very much.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|Yeah...romance...when was the last time a guy rolled YOU the last meatball, gals? Tramp in lifestyle but in his heart a pure-bred. No wonder Lady likes him. Protector of the weak and innocent, Defender of all that matters to his lady...hey guys take a lesson!
B00EDK1LP6|5.0|I listen to this soundtrack a lot while I workout or do outside chores. It keeps me amped and moving right along.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Loved it, it,s amazing how Gladwell pulls together facts and stories.  Look forward to reading much more from this wonderful and stimulating author .
B00A285OOW|5.0|Great book.. I have loved all the books I have read by Philippa Gregory. I will be buying a lot more of her books.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like the marine time feature and being able to choose my own wake up sounds. I would recommend this alarm clock.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|One of many favorite movies I've seen in my lifetime! I'd not watched it for a long time, so I streamed it (from many perks I get for being a member of Amazon Prime) to my PC. Stargate is like Top Gun--doesn't matter how many times I've seen them I never get burned out on them! Prime is the greatest thing out there period. I only wish I could stream to my Android 4.1.2 smartphone!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|First two books I could sit and have a long discussion with you about them, plot points, etc.  I LOVED them and couldn't put them down.  Third book in this so-called trilogy, I also couldn't put it down, but only because I kept turning the pages thinking, &#34;Surely it's going to get better!&#34;  It's so bad that today I don't even recall the storyline.  This author reminds me of Ann Rice.  When she's good, she's fabulous, but when she's bad, STINKS.  If you love Gideon and Eva, just don't bother with this book and create your own ending in your head.  That's what I've done and I must say, it's quite steamy and good! ;)
B000GWE44U|5.0|The Shining is a classic. One of the best movies ever, in my opinion. Jack Nicholson did a great job.
B00FKE3H0G|5.0|I have to hand it to her Miley turned out a really impressive album. My personal favorites : adore you, we can't stop, #getitright, FU, maybe you're right.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Excellent.  Gripping.  Couldn't put it down.  Loved the connection with the Shining.  This will be one of my favorite books.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Not as bad as some would make it out to be, but definitely not the best of the series. This book is really just more of the same filler material. It seems like Day is just stretching for another book for the \\"trilogy\\".
B00CAUHF6U|5.0|it´s a wonderful history of a freedom fighter, since his beginning. Entertained, well written. I recommend it for people who likes to know about outstanding leaders and about the history of how countries were born and  evolved till what they are now-
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Somehow I thought that the trilogy had already been published.  I read Blood Song and started to search for the second one, but soon realized that Anthony is still writing it.  So I was dissapointed with that.  I liked it but I´m not sure if I´ll read the second one as by the time it will be published I will probably have forgotten all that went on in Blood song.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 3 yr old and I love to take care of the horses. The graphics are great. It's a fun game.
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|One of my favorites. Tim Allen's Kirk like role is hilarious. The aliens are sweet, lovable creatures that are a crack up to listen to their dialog.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I found this very hard to use for what I wanted. Looking for an appointment or event calendar I could make notes in. This one didn't work for my needs.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|This book speaks volumes. Must read for doctors and patients alike.<br />I always knew that a lot of nonsense studies fill pagers of medical journals.<br />Now I look at so called luminaries with new awareness.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Love this puzzle. It is addicting.<br />Haven't yet solved it. But, I keep trying. Lots of fun for puzzle enthusiasts. I loved it so much I bought it for gifts.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Nothing could truly live up to The Shining but this is a great book. Stephen King wrote some fantastic books, then he wrote some terrible books but his last few have been very good, and this is no exception. If you haven't read The Shining, you should definitely read it first. In fact I sort of wish I'd read it again, since it's been years since I read it and a knowledge of The Overlook and it's denizens is necessary. Check out the author notes at the end- very enlightening.  My only complaints (minor) is the terrible title and cover art work.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo changed the mail program. I hate it and changing to Bing. Can't read or see all of the inbox at one time and there is no place to click for next page. Trying to navigate thru the new one, I deleted some that needed to be saved. They didn't go to the trash, they were just gone. Moving on from Yahoo.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have been using the Kindle Android format for a while now and love it. i like to read and being able to read Kindle books on my phone, laptop, tablet, or computer has been a wonderful experience. Regardless of where I can access my books from the Kindle app!
1401907725|5.0|The cards are so acurate, for daily use. Or for readings ,would recommend them ., any time. They are well worth the money.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I devoured the first book, went right into the second one and I just can't get enough!  The writing is fantastic and the character development equally delicious.  I find myself thinking about what's going to happen next when I'm not reading and can't wait to find time to read more of it.  I realize that I was late to the show when I started these books, but its become clear to me why they have reached such high acclaim.  Its the perfect escape from reality.  Hang on to your helms - the Dragons are coming!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a very good game I am starting but evenally I will get better and level up. this is my option if you think different Ryan message me on twitter @Seth braniff.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Really improves my phone typing and it is great at learning from common words I use. If it remembers something you don't want it to you can easily remove it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting.  I can't seem to put it down.  The only bad part would be that the update for the Kindle comes out later than the other devices but it's still a really good game to play.
B005LAII1C|5.0|For those of you who love off-color humor.  This is the movie for you.  Seth McFarland is a genius.  The acting was strong and the comedy timing was spot-on.  Don't usually watch movies more than once or twice.  But this one deserves dusting off and watching at least once per year.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|This Review is for the Tudors the complete series .  I am so glad i bought this show ,very entertaining .  I will let all the other reviewers marvel about this show, This review is for the product itself I played and watched all 15 discs on my portable Dvd player and they all worked fine, am very happy with this purchase,  Also on some of the discs you get some episodes of Dexter , Californication and the United states of Tara .  Not Bad.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|When I first heard that the Walking Dead was a show about zombies, my immediate reaction was that it wouldn't be worth it to watch, not my sort of entertainment, ever.  Then my buddy at work started telling me about the show and it sounded funny, original , and suspenseful, not like the typical zombie fare where screaming, terrified idiots run and fall down and run some more, but can't escape decomposed bodies that can only walk, while also dragging one leg, at that.<br /><br />I watched the first episode and I was just pulled into the story in the way great films can do to you, by bringing the viewer much closer to a fictional reality. You find yourself at times, in the shoes of the character and the hard decisions put on leaders.<br /><br />Give it a try even if you hate horror movies in general, which i do. This show has deep, enthralling stories rich in character development, and is refreshing compared to any corporate network trash. It's not about the undead unearthing themselves and catching the slowest, dumbest people.  It's more about what life and survival really means, and examines the nature of loyalty in the face of self-preservation while still being social creatures who need each other.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I have never read this author before but I will read her again. This book kept me engrossed and laughing. I enjoyed the characters and found it difficult to put down. I can not wait to read the next book in the series.
B00000G3PL|5.0|I just got a new big screen and wanted these in full screen, these discs are two sided so you know.  The series especially the first one are classic saw it in the drive in when it came out (first one) and are quite enjoyable, will watch the first one tonight again.  This is a funny, serious, action, gun play, drama.  For people my age enjoy, I'm 43.
B00E688KA4|5.0|Tyr continues to out do themselves with each album.<br /><br />Great guitar work,clean vocals, and the Valkyrie/ Freyja theme runs throughout the entire album.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|This is a good band, with a powerful sound, and Revolution is a GREAT song.  This is an excellent CD to play while driving.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Truly a jewel.  From the first three pages you are hooked and connected to the human elements that drive us all. Enjoy.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This book kept me reading because I just had to know who the murderers were. The characters were so well written that I had disgust for some, and felt sorry for others. This book was so well written that I felt like I knew all the characters and the lifestyles. I was rooting for Libby through the whole book as everyone else had. I was happy for her that she found out what happened to her family with the help of someone she befriended.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I had been waiting for this book ever since I heard King was writing it and it didn't disappoint. Not a horror story like the first one which was refreshing. I feel if he was trying to replicate the tone to The Shining it would have been a letdown. Instead it was a good versus evil story of life and death. I was captivated from the first page all the way to the end. The Shining is still superior but any fan of King will find this book just as enjoyable as I did.
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|This is such a fun group.  Love their talent. Harmonies are really good. If you don't know them check them out on You Tube.
B007I1TFK0|5.0|Love this movie, and as Argentina that I am, I think Madonna played this role incredibly well! Loooooveeee her!!!!<br />Also the blue ray disc was received in perfect condition.
030746363X|5.0|Read it and find out! Lots of good and thoughtful things to ponder about or even try out for yourself! lots of words are needed for this review
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King..............im ready for your next book hurry it the heck up... :OP<br />this book was very easy to read, i love how he tied it together with the shining without going overboard this book is not the shining, it definitely stands alone but at the same time is a great companion....... CONSTANT READER...............
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I think they take best comedy on TV ever!  The DVD is so worth it because you can watch these shows over and over and still laugh and enjoy them.
B00755646W|5.0|Wow! This Madonna's era was fascinating... This documentary is not available in blue ray in my country, I don't knwo why... so I'm very happy to have been able to buy at Amazon this article.
B0064W67IM|5.0|A trip down memory lane... I purchased the originals many many many years ago. The digital format took me a minute to figure out, but once I did it was fun reading it.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|Best Christmas movie ever made. This is a timeless classic that kicks off the Christmas season in my family year after year.
B00CEZJT2E|5.0|I love it.<br />With the new iOS 7, battery life on the iPhone 5 has noticeable diminished and this product helps get me through the day away from an outlet. The product is slim, packs easily, fairly light weight, reasonably priced and gets me at least 2 full iPhone 5 recharges. It would be perfect if it came with a shortened iPhone plug.
0606238433|2.0|the binding looks very cheap and wasn't at all what I expected.  You're better off spending a few extra dollars and getting a nicer paperback or actual hardcover
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Woot! Another impossible to put down novel. It's Stephen King of old in a new and exciting way. More please.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|All of Doyle's stories are well written. I feel as if I'm in the sitting room with him. Can't you just feel the fog?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great book by King- reminds me of his earlier and most gripping work. It's wonderfully entertaining- scary, thrilling, touching.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it to everybody. Enders game had a way of skipping years of Enders life without the reader feeling lost. And without the \\"years later\\" junk. A perfect read.
B0040I09RM|5.0|This was a wonderful surprise. I hadn't expected such a thrilling storyline.<br />I do not miss an episode now.  You'll love it too.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Very different approach to the healing of a broken life. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. There were times I wanted to give the main character a good shake, tell her to grab onto the positives in her life & enjoy what she had accomplished.  However, the book is so well-written that I could well understand this choices this character made. She had faced enormous challenges since the time of her infancy, and her struggles and errors as she gradually matures into a young woman who achieves a reasonable satisfaction with life and her place in it, kept me reading late into the night.  (Also, if you happen to enjoy flowers & gardening, this book will have an added layer  of enjoyment for you.)
B0031F0DVC|5.0|Amazing film, never gets old. Great plot, great cinematography, and overall perfect. Watch the subbed version, the dub is eh.
B004G7UTXG|4.0|This movie has historical relevance and is well acted.  But it is an emotional bummer.  You hope for a good outcome, but the ending is depressing.  Real life is often depressing and the reward is not in this world.  You'll see if you watch it.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|I believe the plot, script, and all the acting by all of the primary actors  as a combined team helped this movie become so successful and definitely one of my favorites.  Good movies I can see on a repeating basis. Without a doubt I have seen this one between 15 to 20 times.<br /><br />My film library consists of thousands of DVD's  and numerous TV series going from season 1 to season 7 if so filmed.<br /><br />We all have the right to have a difference of opinion, and this is mine.<br />Thank you,<br />Bob, from Texas
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Once you pick up a Stephen King book, it's hard to put it down.  His ability to hold the reader's attention has not diminished after all these years. Doctor Sleep is no exception.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|I recieved my package in true Amazon fashion, extremely fast, I love Amazon Prime shipping.  The DeLorean is packaged in a beautiful box, not your average lego cardboard disposable box, but a reclosable package with fantastic graphics and thick cardboard.  The legos are packaged in the same clear bags you have grown to expect.  The instruction booklet is bound, with lots of details about the movie and related lego model.  A steal of a price for this much detail.  I want 2 more so I don't have to take mine apart to build the other models!
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|I love Karl Urban but this is a movie that he should have left for some other actor to do. Not the worst movie I ever saw but it's down there.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great story, loved every minute of it! Keeps you guessing in every episode. Definitely recommend this show, its a must see.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|It was the type of entertainment I like and was well produced. The story lines were good. Was a good continuation of the first season.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Put simply, for the money this is one heck of a mouse. Up there competing against huge names like razer, logitech, etc.
B00E6887H0|5.0|this is absolutely a must .<br />fantastics musicians and cooder at his best go and get it,<br />you will not regret it  wee need a dvd from this concert
B008TT7CXW|5.0|Christmas gift for the son-in-law.  It was exactly what he wanted!  Thanks for your prompt attention and fast service!! recommended
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The life and times of Jesus as a Zealot, is revealed in this exploratory work by Reza Aslan. Taking the Zealot' s life out of Nazareth, and following him to Jerusalem was and a fascinating study of Jesus as a compelling figure in history. I think was the fact that Jesus' theology was advanced by the preaching and the writings of Paul the Apostle who carried his message into the world. Here was a man whom Jesus had never known by through faith carried this message into the world.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed The Racketeer. It was less of a procedural drama and more of a mystery. I could see the end coming, but that didn't reduce my fun in reading the story.
B00DJYKFXG|5.0|I have to say this is probably the best music purchase I have made this year.<br />It is really awesome. It brings back so many memories of my youth.<br />Love the Band. Thanks Robbie for making this music available.
B00BEIYGK2|5.0|From Richard Curtis, the creative soul who gave us \\"Notting Hill\\" and \\"Love Actually,\\" we have an R-rated romantic comedy that satisfies our need for the occasional outing that features unabashedly happy families, solid marriages and well-loved children. Plus, it boasts the most hilarious wedding reception I think I've ever seen.<br /><br />A young man inherits a family trait that allows him to replay key moments in time and change them to his advantage. We come to laugh out loud whenever he says \\"Would you please excuse me for a moment?\\"<br /><br />It features:<br />  * Domhnall Gleeson (\\"Anna Karenina\\") is Tim, the fellow who can manipulate time, but who can't foretell some of the results. You can see the warm intelligence in his eyes.<br />  * Rachel McAdams (\\"The Vow\\") is Mary, the object of his affections. This Canadian actress is no stranger to relationships with time travelers (\\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\"); but we laugh when her Mary insists she won't take her panties off for Scotland! (You'll love the scene.)<br />  * Bill Nighy (\\"Blow Dry\\") is Bill's father. Dad is a cautious veteran of this phenomenon. This character is droll, wise, and a great father.<br />  * Lindsay Duncan (LOTS of British TV) Her sweetly ferocious Mum fooled me. I actually thought I was watching the French actress Julie Delpy!<br />  * Lydia Wilson (British TV) is Kit Kat, Tim's rambunctious sister who causes a LOT of turmoil.<br />  * Mitchell Mullen (\\"RED 2\\") is Mary's father, Fitz, who is mentally out to lunch much of the time.<br /><br />The plot becomes fairly complex so it can become a challenge to follow if you have any hearing problems because much of it is either murmured or whispered. The script is witty and warm but there were times I needed captions; I know I'll LOVE my DVD! Yes, I'll order this one from Amazon as soon as it's available.<br /><br />Important Note: You'll be happy to know one of your colleagues contacted me and both the DVD and the downloadable (is that a word?) version have closed captions! Yippee!
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Even if you don't agree with all of Pressfield's assumptions, this is one of the best treatises on the creative process and work ethic available. Highly recommended!
B00CSR2J9I|1.0|The only reason this got one star is it wouldn't let me select zero stars.  This was a virus that popped as soon as it finished installing.
B0002Y4T92|5.0|I Loved it so much that I bought a couple more as gifts for Friends for Christmas. They are Blues Fans too & I Know I'll be Rocking their Christmas this year.<br />Thanks so very much Amazon.<br />:D
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Even though I am horrible at this game it it a great match game. Vivid colors large screen and easy to follow directions you will like this game.
0763668966|5.0|This is not your average geography book. It is beautifully illustrated down to the last detail. It does not include every country of the world but does hit on many different countries and includes each continent. Famous people, insects, animals, cultural events, plants and more are included. Don't let your age stop you from buying this book; you don't need to be a kid to appreciate the information and artistry. Would make a fabulous coffee table book or reference manual for any classroom. Young and old alike will enjoy perusing this gem.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|I got this almost a week after I anticipated at least, I got it days before the last expected day. I love this show and it is so awesome to finally own it!
B009ZQGNPQ|5.0|Without adding a spoiler - the season finale made me sad beyond belief. I'm addicted to this series and cannot wait to see season 4 unfold!++
B000053ZRR|5.0|Surviving strong since 80's Jon and the boys rock out in this concert video!! Musically they still are as solid as any band!! For any Bon Jovi fan to not have this dvd would be a shame!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I wanted to try something new to get myself prepared to go back to to the gym on a regular basis. My goal is to lose 15lbs that I gained in a year. Dieting does not work for me because once I go back to eating what I would normally eat, that's when the pounds start to pack on.<br /><br />I decided to just change my portion size but still eat what I want. I also incorporated more water in my diet because I'm not a water drinker. So here's the results so far.<br /><br />I have lost 8 of the 15 pounds I wanted to lose! I am on Day 3 of level 3 and hoping to lose at least another two lbs by the time I am done with the dvd.<br /><br />I took 5 days off to give myself and my muscles a rest because you will have days that your sore. I think the workouts are for everyone no matter what your ability is.  Give it a try!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Enjoy reading and studying Scripture w/ this app; wish it included the Voice translation, though....<br />A five-star rating is well-deserved!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great fun game with many levels.  My friends and I play against each other to see who gets to the highest levels.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|It only work on 1080p TVs.<br />I personally like other solutions out there. Its not for me.<br />Video and Audio quality is not great.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|...intriguing..best possible job to bring a classic to the silver screen. Perfectly chosen actors with surprising talents.  Luv, luv, luv!!!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This game is wonderful..kids are loving it. Easy to learn and way better from the first version. Must see it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|How come we don't have the hovercraft or the beach. I have this game on my galaxy s2 that my son downloaded from Google play and it has those updates... I love Amazon app store but it is constantly behind on updates...
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|as with all the Stephen King books, Iwas hooked from the first page. He makes you see each character vividly, and get into the story from the &#34;get go&#34;.
0385486804|5.0|a great book. wish i read it before i saw the movie.  sad story but a good read for anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've heard nothing but rave reviews about this game, but had been unable to access it through the Amazon app store. But now we have it! And they were all right! Excellent game, highly addictive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thanks AMAZON FOR BRINGING CANDY CRUSH SAGA TO KINDLE FIRE HD. I AM SO HAPPY.  WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT MY KINDLE FIRE HD A FEW MONTHS AGO, I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED I COULD NOT PLAY CANDY CRUSH SAGA.  NOW I AM SO ELATED!
B0026PA05M|5.0|I love this CD and play it all the time.  Lzzy is one bad you-know-what, and when I sing along it makes me feel like I am, too!  My fav bad @$$ songs are It's Not You, What Were You Expecting, Nothing to Do With Love, and Conversation Over.  My fav sexy songs are I Get Off and Dirty Mind.  While I don't know how to classify it, I absolutely LOVE Familiar Taste of Poison.  There's something so eerie about it.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Super fun...but you can definitely tell that it's a game they want you to play on a VERY Regular basis, which is good because I do!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|If you don't love this movie I'm in shock! It's just one of those classic old time movies that will always be in your favorites collection that you watch over and over all the time! Movies today don't have that special touch anymore.
B0070YDOT8|5.0|great fun. want blackjack and Texas hold 'em made more attractive.  love the scatter slot games and the word game played like hold 'em poker.  chips go on sale often and plenty ways to earn free chips.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I received this dvd within a couple weeks. This dvd was in great condition and plays perfectly and not to mention it's an awesome movie.
1426308469|5.0|This is a book that is informative yet fun. A needed addition to kids who think dinosaurs rock! Learning about them rocks too.
B00BEIYMAG|2.0|Take &quot;The Amityville Horror&quot; (which has been disproved time and again) and add the film The Exorcist, (which is fiction)  then sprinkle a dash of the innocent people who lost their lives during The Salem Witch Trials (wow, stoop any lower?) - and voila!  You have this film.<br /><br />The only redeeming factors for me were Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor (who hasn't aged hardly at all..fabulous actress)!.  James Wan's direction in this was almost &quot;homemade&quot; (i.e. paranormal activity)...and of course the &quot;world renowned demonologist&quot; and his famously clairvoyant wife..(really???) were ready, willing and able to do interviews. Charlatans much?  Hubby is absurd with his cross wielding &quot;onward christian soldier/warrior stance&quot;. (he is a demonologist, but not ridiculous enough to believe in vampires) *snicker*  And the wife, herself would be called a &quot;soothsayer&quot; and therefore, according to their own tenet laws in Christianity - a witch herself.<br /><br />So, no, this is not for rational people, because as a reasonable, rational human being you will find horrible flaws that make the story even more difficult to believe (I don't believe it at all), and rational movie watchers want to see things less religious, and closer to &quot;maybe!&quot; ..that don't claim to be true.  And religion is just TOO real..and too ridiculous.  Even the beginning states that Ed Warren is &quot;recognised by the Catholic Church&quot;.  ahaha  That was really all I needed to know - yet I did watch it; there were parts that I liked (usually involving Lili or Vera) but the story and direction were flat.  Two stars for the ladies and kid's acting.  Nothing for Wan, religion nor anyone else.  Especially not the Perron charlatan who wrote the book many years after it supposedly happened so that no one can prove it wrong.  Ahhh the &quot;devil&quot; really is in the details.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i like my little pony because when i got this app i was impresed on the work<br />:D i seen all episodes
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|This sequel to the Shining is a great follow-up to a novel which is a cornerstone of today's horror lit.  In the decades since The Shining, King's writing has really matured, and this sequel is wonderfully crafted and filled with lots of heart.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy read. Great story line! I really liked this book. A 12 year old could read it. A great one for curling up by the fire with tea.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|....This really was a good mystery - a good cat and mouse murder mystery.  The ending is a nice surprise - unless you've seen a lot of films (in that case you will see it coming as I did) but it's still nicely played out.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It is fun and cool. You get different ways to save people.every time. I like the video. It is easy to play and great for kids.
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This is one of the best horror movies I've seen this year since the conjuring.  this is actually a great remake I have not seen the original but I know it is probably good too. I thought that everyone did a great job but jane levy was amazing and scary when she was evil mia. I think what made this a good remake was the fact that the original creators of the original film did it. I would put this in my top 20 best horror movies made. if you have not seen this then I recommend you do
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game is fabulous. I hardly recommended.<br />It´s sometimes really hard to use the option multiplayer, but the rest of the App is great
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|wow this is really easy to use and it is electronic.  I have looked for something to organize for a while.  can not be happier will use daily.  thanks
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I really loved the characters and story line. I was real happy with the ending. I'm a big King fan!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited it made it to kindle! I've loved this game for months on my phone and computer. Love that it is so much bigger and easier to see than my phone.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|king simply is a master at reaching into your chest and taking your heart in his hands,  then let's you dangle while deciding whether to let it go or burst it.  abra stone is one of the most lovable teenaged characters of his since charlie in firestarter, and Danny Torrence is a pleasure to get to watch &#34;grow up&#34;
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Not the best CD for me, but JM is an excellent guitar player and have been evolving since his first record. This CD still have that country touch. Will like more continuum for the following record.
B00285K1KE|3.0|The movie is OK, biggest attraction for me is that it was filmed close by to where I live. The movie, however, is quite slow and often very affected with numerous cinematography tricks like split screen that in my mind do not add anything and just seem like they have been thrown in to make the movie stand out from other superhero flicks.
1250030951|4.0|I've been staring at my computer screen for the past 3 hours and I still have no clue how to review Fangirl. How am I suppose to express my love for it in few words? Granted that it wasn't as good as Eleanor and Park, it wasn't as addicting or as romantic as E&P, but Fangirl was a masterpiece in it's own and doesn't need any comparisons. It was beautiful, meaningful and a completely relatable story about a girl who loves to read and write, as simple as that. What's not to love about that!<br /><br />  Fangirl started off really slow and I found myself easily distracted and at times even uninterested in Cath's story. Cath was a total nerd head to toe, she obsessed over Simon Snow (fictional Harry Potter) all the time, bought shirts and poster and random knick-knacks featuring him, and not only that, she even wrote fan-fictions (very popular and in-demand fan-fictions at that!) about him and the Mage world. All this fangirling was very surprising for me, I've never met a person like Cath in real life and maybe that's the reason I was so weirded out/amazed/a little uninterested in her life. And that's clearly an odd thing to say because I obsess over books too, but I'm 100% sure that Cath's level was much much higher than mine. Nevertheless, after few chapters, I was on board with this story and in love with Simon Snow's world, especially the one from Cath's perspective. As a person who hasn't read fanfic in her life, I would say that that part of the story was done exceptionally well. It gave us few glimpses into Cath's writing and her passion towards it, and that's what made this story so special and relatable to me personally as a book blogger.<br /><br />  Fangirl was not only about Simon Snow and fanfiction, it was more about Cath, her revolving relationship with her twin sister, Wren, her socially awkward personality, but on top of everything Fangirl was about Cath staying true to herself through thick and thin and not changing a bit for anybody! That is a quality I admire in a person and I thank Rainbow Rowell for writing a character like Cath. She's definitely one of a kind and it would be a shame to let her story pass by. Though the one thing I didn't fangirl over in this book was the romance. It was cute in a geeky way, but certainly not something I looked forward to throughout the story.<br /><br />  All in all, Fangirl indeed turned me into a fangirl towards Rainbow Rowell. I can't praise this author anymore if I tried! This is my second book and I'm already in love with her writing and characterization. Plus, RR is a champion when it comes to open endings. The one in Fangirl was so appropriate and well placed, it gave us enough information so we could form our own ending and be happy with it or leave it where it ended and be completely satisfied with it. Perfect! In simple words, Fangirl should be in everyone's Must Read!!!y I admire in a person and I thank Rainbow Rowell for writing a character like Cath.

B00E7SFAAG|4.0|I m new at this gming thing and this is the first and only game that I hve down loaded so far.  I'm a grandma and I like to garden and this easy little game just maks me laugh out loud!
B00005JM02|5.0|My grandson loves this movie and the plush toy Nemo to go with it. It is fun to watch as a family.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Love this show!!! Can't wait to see how the new season pans out, the premiere was awesome!! Enjoy, I definitely recommend!
B0054JELS4|5.0|Can't always watch as programs are produced so it is great to get a whole season to watch individual programs at leisure.  Delivery was as promised.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I loved this movie!  Saw it several times.  Rupert Penry Jones is really good and very hot! Makes me wish I was 40 years younger! I<br /> thought the acting was excellent all the way around.  Didn't think Wentworth should be so hung up on Louisa.  An excellent product!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I read the trilogy and anxiously awaited the release of the movie. After seeing it in the theater, I knew that I wanted to own it. I've watched it with many people and everyone enjoys it.
031624662X|5.0|I can't recall whether it was the premise or John Scalzi's endorsement that caused me to pick up a copy of Ancillary Justice, but am I ever glad I did. It's stunningly original and well executed.<br /><br />It's a really interesting premise with great execution. The story alternates two timelines, both told from the protagonists point of view. In one, the protagonist is the starship's AI that controls both ship and thousands of human-bodied robot soldiers. In the other, taking place twenty years later, the AI has been reduced to just a single one of those bodies, carrying out her mission over twenty years.<br /><br />Ann Leckie masterfully describes the underlying culture and politics, tying together both plot and cultural details and values. Although space empires are a common setting in scifi novels, making up an entire subgenre, the storytelling is fresh and wonderful.<br /><br />Now I just have to go see about getting an advance review copy of the next novel...
B0027MJU00|4.0|I felt completely drawn in. Captivated.  Unlike anything I've read before. I didn't put it down unless I finished it.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|It was OK. Kind of over the top and ridiculous. The slo-mo scenes were unnecessary and awful. I think these parts were made only to be seen in 3d, so watching like this you can see how dumb those scenes are. Lots of gore that didn't really seem necessary, like they were trying to shock the viewer.  Having said all that, I guess I was entertained, I watched the whole thing.
0061900656|5.0|I sent this to my friend's son who is 3 as she is expecting her second soon.She tells me that he likes it and that it is helpful in increasing his understanding about the new baby.
B00DWHWOFC|5.0|size of grid and magnify option a plus. only thing that could improve is greying out numbers in rows or. columns when the squares have been filled.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm so glad this game is finally available on the Kindle Fire! Ive had it on my phone for a while and I'm addicted as much as everyone else. Now if only I can get it to download on my KF...
B0053O89JM|5.0|It's the final season, and seemed to end quite right.  A lot happened in this season and although it has been out for awhile, I am not going to spoil it on here.  If you like house so far this will make a great addition.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Love her style, and how invoking her music truly is!!! Hope to see more from this artist in the future!!!
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|I really enjoy this type of game and this one didn't disappoint. I got it on sale, but worth regular price.
B004CT5GOU|5.0|i have been researching doll houses since the summer for my 4 yr old.  i finally settled on this one by kidkraft...i recieved it today and opened it to make sure it was the correct item.  let me tell you, the real thing is even better than i could have imagined!  the furniture is sturdy and painted beautifully.  the doll house it self is a bit heavy and will take time and following instructions to put it together but that is to be expected. the details are vivid and lively, also IT DOES FIT BARBIE SIZE DOLLS! i wish it was christmas tommorow because i know this doll house is more than she can imagine!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Love it so far. Takes up where the Shining left off. I've been waiting for this book since Amazon had it on pre-order.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|From the special effects to the pace to the acting, this does not disappoint!  Buying it in this form makes it accessible to anyone with the means to watch any form of digital media and at a great price!
B001EBV0NU|4.0|So silly, dumb and stupid it's actually somewhat funny. I just love seeing the little aliens, forget the rest! lol
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've read this book many times. Each time I take away a new lesson. For this I am grateful. I know Andrew Wiggins is not a real person, but he embodies the best of us as humans. Thank you Orson Scott Card for showing us what each of us is capable of when pushed to the limits of endurance. I am a 62 year old woman attempting to earn an RN license  after many years of caring for others. I am learning Physics with absolutely no background in either Algebra or Chemistry. Whenever I think of giving up I think of Ender. Thank you.
B006K1IIHA|2.0|Sherlock is amazing and everyone should watch it! However, beware purchasing blurays manufactured in the UK because as I found out, even if the bluray and the player are region free, it still might not work. I purchased through the app which gave me no warning. I ended up returning my blurays without being able to watch them. Check that your player is on the list that will play UK blurays. FYI, anything sony is out, and playstation by extension.
B005FVNJTS|5.0|Let me state at the onset, I am a diehard Roger Federer fan. Yet, I picked this book up first before reading anything about Roger Federer and I have not been disappointed.<br />This book gives a peek about what goes behind making of a Champion! I always admired RaFa's tenacity on the court and this book explains how he worked on it. It is truly admirable reading about his dedication and how he surmounted odds to reach the pinnacle in professional tennis. The support he received from his closely knit family and team members is truly admirable and I would not hesitate to give it a 5 Star. Though my personal favourite would remain Roger Federer, RaFa can truly be counted as an All Time great in the tennis history. (Not that he needs any certificate from me) The biggest thing I took from this book is the sheer single mindedness in pursuit of glory, you have to make sacrifices galore. You don't get it easy. But it is worth in the end. I am glad I lived in the time of Roger Federer. I am glad I have lived during the era of Rafael Nadal. Awesome book!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Another gift for my brother, I saw it in the theater and it's a great movie.  Likely one of the best Bond movies ever.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Fabulous, Fantastic, when does the new season start? Can not wait!!!! Another season of suspense. Can not wait TO SEE WHAt will happen next.
B001DF68MA|3.0|The quality seemed fine but I didn't really get a chance to test it out.  It's just way too small for my child.  He's 14 months old and we couldn't get his thighs into the seat.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every child should be required to read this book before 5th grade. Treat others the way you would want to be treated.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My favorite is finally on my Kindle!! No more  playing on my phone! The game I love to hate, even being stuck on a level for weeks keeps me coming back for more.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This is another wonderful season. Sitting on the edge of my seat waiting for the next show. What is going to happen next? You never know. Yes another great season.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Really enjoy the river while reading or going to sleep. I have really been able to drown out distractions. Best one so far.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been playing this on Facebook for a long time. When I got my kindle a year ago I was so upset that candy crush wasn't available for it. I'm super excited it is now!!!!!!
B006TKP2B2|5.0|Rarely do we get truly new ideas in a field where we feel we have some knowledge. Bravo to the author!
B00FN811SY|5.0|I can't believe this is free!  Everything you could possibly want for bible research in such an easy to use format. As you read along and have a question about a word or phrase you can just touch the highlighted number of that verse and chose from cross reference, parallel bible versions or footnotes. We're using it every day!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I think one of his better books - exciting and fun read.  Humanized Dan Torrance, nice to see him deal with his personal demons and rise to the challenge.  Loved the plot twists and I also envision potential exists for another book about Abra as she gets older, etc.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This is a great alarm. Im in 8th grade and its hard to wake up in the morning.this is a great alarm clock it always wakes me up,except for when my volume is ff
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the book!!! Thought it was as good as the first two. It doesn't bother me that she didn't wrap the story up in this one. That just means we get one more book.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|I think this is a good coming of age movie about a young boy and what his perceptions of what love should be. That idealistic idea of what love is shown to be not as idealistic as he imagined
1587613379|5.0|I was expected the authors to talk more about what they think is a perfect ideological state. Mrs. Easton and Mrs. Hardy give a much more practical explanation, reason why polyamory works, and how to work through insecurities. They offer short mental exercises to help people understand the how and why they may feel jealous or insecure. I was impressed with this.<br /><br />The authors are up front that polyamory isn't for everyone. Their book is for those who want to know more about this life style and how to work on these kinds of relationships.<br /><br />If you are interested to know how polyamory works and why hundreds of thousands of people have chosen this kind of life then I highly recommend this book.
B000ALZHUC|1.0|It is no wonder why Sodom only tried black metal on the two records that appear on this CD. That is because they were terrible at it. Had they not changed their style to thrash on &#34;Persecution Mania,&#34; they would never have been associated with Kreator and Destruction.<br /><br />This album is directionless and a waste of time. Don't bother with it. It sounds like the Ramones trying to play black metal.
1401937519|5.0|Courageous journey and inspiring.  Wayne Dwyer backs up the authenticity of her experience and ongoing service in her life.  Lovely person to survive and come back to share.
B002APU580|4.0|it was an enjoyable movie though it does leave out a couple of things that I thought important. it was still a wonderful movie that i enjoyed a lot.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual King has taken the ordinary and made it something new. Captivating account of what could have happened to Danny as an adult.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I love this game, but it cost to much for the dragons, most dragons cost 500 gold, you have to buy the gold or have friend send 1 at a time. Cost to much to expand to new areas and to clear the areas. Also, I got a new phone, but I have to create a \\"NEW\\" Storm ID, which means I have to start over. That is just BS.
1451627289|5.0|Enjoyable fantasy that had a great ending.  Each segment was intriguing in its concept, and kept me entertained as well as imparting &#34;what if&#34; considerations.  The conclusion was absolutely satisfying and put it all in perspective for looking at many life changing happenings.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|THIS BOOK IS JUST SIMPLY AMAZING. NICE TWIST IN THE EPIOLOGUE. WAS NOT SUPRISED BY IT WHATSOEVER. WICKED IS WICKED,NOT GOOD
B000HX6DCO|5.0|I watch this movie over and over, it never gets old! LOVE IT!!! Matt Stone and Trey Parker are true geniuses. They just know how to tickle my funnybone!
B00AMQ1B1O|5.0|A priceless collection of unforgettable movie moments and commentary. Mark Cousins creates the filmic equivalent of the ultimate film class.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this game makes me so happy that I scrapped  my pants with joy it is so fun that I cried it is agreat game
0744014956|5.0|It certaily helped mybhusband who normally utilizes online guides, but the book had amazing bonus deatires and helped w missions ans details he could not find online.
B00ECR7L0Y|5.0|Fantastic movie, it looks great on my plasma TV, and it was delivered a day before I expected. NICE. Lots of fun for all Shakespeare and Whedon fans!
B009NET0H8|3.0|I purchased the download version for my iPad hoping to take advantage of the retina display viewing the photos. The photos on each page are very small and won't expand to fill the iPad display. I tried everything I could but can't make the photos bigger. If I'd known that, I wouldn't have bought the book. The &#34;Look Inside&#34; feature on Amazon is very deceiving, too, because the photos are full page when viewing there. So beware if you're planning on getting this for your iPad or other tablet.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I purchased 2 other brand adapters, neither one worked with Windows 7. This one has the correct chip and works perfectly with Windows 7.

B003YL4LYI|5.0|My favorite parts are about Jon and the Imp.  Never assume anything with these books this is book 5 and I can't wait for book 6.
B0002I664Y|5.0|This movie is one of Brando's best, I think. It's got a great story, great acting, great setting, great scenery, etc. I love the morality of it. The bad guy is the good guy and vice versa. The &#34;good&#34; sheriff is a hypocrite who has the town's respect. It has a love story, too. Surfers talk about the great surf in the background. I love it.
B005HIREJK|5.0|I love this watch.  I have more expensive watches, but this one is  by far the best value.  Only one minor complaint is the date could be larger.
B00991TCOG|5.0|I have buyers in China.Although not yet received the goods, but when I listen to tracks already feel good listening, I believe that CD quality sound will be better
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great straight out of the box. Every tv should come with one as standard! Adds so much extra functionality to your tv and the ability to play local files and youtube videos on your tv while using your phone or laptop to complete other tasks is amazing.
B00EP0KYDO|5.0|Not sure why this only got 3 stars on average. We rented it first because of that then bought it the next day because we liked it so much. I loved the storyline and the overall visual effects. My son who is 13 loved this movie and we liked it as much as he did.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am a huge Candy Crush fan and I have been waiting for this game for so long on Amazon! And now it's finally here! YEEEEEEEEEEEES
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Nice app.  Great on Kindle.  Must have.  I would recommend it highly. I would buy it again if needed. Awesome.
B002QS1O36|5.0|This movie was stupendous, and just plain out amazing.<br />I would  recommend this movie to any one who likes music and drama
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I tuned in to Breaking Bad at season 4.  It was great to catch up starting with season 1.  What an amazingly brilliant series.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I was Kinda sketchy about getting it. it sucks. needs to be an app like on the apple app store for facebook. I cant stand this one at all. the graphics suck and I cant do anything. i wouldn't recommend it!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Step by step the author gives a map for substantiating a belief in what many now know to be mainstream.  Of course there will always be those who beg to differ. It's all ok, we will all get there eventually. There really isn't any place else to begin with. It's all good.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Absolutely loved it and found it VERY hard to put down!!! An amazing story and truly fascinating characters that pull you in and do Not let go!!  Another masterpiece by THE master,Stephen King. Guaranteed reading enjoyment!!!
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|this game is horrible it is retarded do not buy and eats cows because this game stinks the thing doesn't even work don't buy
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Great app hurry its free they give u lots of features and you could take pictures and record videos of yourself try the app it's really fun and good
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that it's here! I hate that there we're other game out the trying to be like them and it I could not understand why they would not just put it on the kindle everyone was playing it. I sit and play for hrs. The colors are so popping and everything is so big it's great to see how big it is. I recommend this to anyone!
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Play it this gave is very fun once you start there ain't no stopping you. You will be addicted to it
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Awesome work. Quick and enjoyable read. Good job Grisham. Now I'm inspired to avoid television and get back to reading.
B00E8S2KV2|5.0|The Tolkien Family does not approve; but I wonder if JRRT might have done.<br /><br />The theatrical release was, of course, all about Peter Jackson's interpretation of JRR Tolkein's wonderful imagination.  Purists and fans of pasty-faced suck-ups will probably find reasons to complain.  But for me, the scenery of New Zealand once again becomes Middle Earth.  And no, I don't expect a movie about wizards and dragons to be realistic.<br /><br />Mind you, I do think the unhygienic Radagast is a bit too silly; but there are many lighthearted moments in the original works.  Just not so much bathroom humor.<br /><br />As this is written before the release, I must add that caveat; but I have been very pleased with all of the LOTR Extended Editions and--based on that track record--expect this to be even better.<br /><br />I will change my review should my hopes be dashed.
B00D2ZF24O|1.0|Saw this movie in theaters and it was terrible.  The worst Will Smith movie that I have ever seen.  Not sure how much acting experience his son had, but he still needs to work on it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Haven't read Stephen King in a very long time. I'm so glad I read this.  The Shining was great and that peaked my interest in this. Could have given a little more info about The Knot. Otherwise,  it was a good read.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a long book but very ll written.  Ms. Morton writes with knowledge and has an amazing way with words. You won't be disappointed.
1579655327|1.0|When I buy a cookbook I expect a certain ratio of recipes to pictures and text, but overall, recipes should predominate.  This \\"cookbook\\" has very few recipes, and many are not what I would consider to be a recipe: \\"Morning Melon\\" suggests you cut open a melon and add some yogurt, or even granola and drizzle with honey.  Then eat outside in the morning sun.  Seriously?  The \\"cookbook\\" devotes quite a few pages to photos of people, with many shots of serious looking people.  Why, I don't know.  If you want a \\"cookbook\\" full of photos of people and background information, then this could be the book for you.  It wasn't for me.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Edgy, seductive, and intense! I could not watch them fast enough! Great series. Jumping into season 2 right away. Not for children's eyes or ears.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|No possible review could be good enough to say how powerful and humbling the retelling of Operation Redwing really was. It strikes you to the core and makes you thank God such men live. One of the best military novels I've read. Also suggest reading The Warrior Elite as it will set the stage in helping understand BUD/S. The class in that book, 228 is also the same class referred to in this book.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This method of learning a language is almost addictive:  I do not seem to get tired of learning.<br />thank you for such a good app
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game keeps me interested by adding new scenes and continuously moving the objects.  Overall a great game for free.
B005N1E8A4|5.0|One of the best Kylie Minogue concert. Too bad I couldn't see it live.<br />She is fun to watch and her singing is pretty good.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a big fan of Stephen King.  I would recommend this to everyone who loves him.  We get to see what happens to Danny Torrance as an older boy.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I am really enjoying this game.  The puzzles are challenging enough to keep you interested, but not so difficult that I get frustrated.  The only problem I have had with the game is that I'm letting it keep me up at night!
B008EL25LE|1.0|Samsung Galaxy Note 3.<br />The first version was fun and had good graphics.  It was a great way too waste some time on a break. I could not open the sequel so I can not write a proper review.  Uninstalled
B000PHVZNE|5.0|Can't say enough!  Great movie!
B00AX6KNOY|4.0|Just like the subject says. This ain't no piece of cinematic genius, but it's fun, and sometimes that's all you want.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|The app works great with the kindle minus the advertisements it allows the kindle to download you tube videos quicker and without to may delays.
B00COMLLX2|5.0|I love pinball, and have fond memories playing with my dad in arcades. That said, I'm pretty young (mid 20's) and am more familiar with modern video games than old timey arcade games. While I love real machines, pinball apps that stay true to the original (ie Pinball Arcade) don't really hold my interest. The fun of actual machines is being able to look at the artwork close up and lean forward to look at a cool feature, and at least for me, it was lost when looking at a tablet screen. Part of the fun of Pinball Arcade has to do with remembering the original machines, which as a youngster, I do not.<br /><br />That said, Zen Pinball is what I wish real machines would be like, but I know they will never be. Epic battles rage, Vortexes loom, lighting effects change, and even ball colors change. Not only that, but each table is uniquely its own. For an example, on The Avengers table, the player can select which hero they want to be (and thus select a uniquely colored ball that looks like said hero), while on Epic Quest, you can level up a character over multiple games and improve his armor and abilities. How cool is that!? A pinball RPG! I have purchased every single one of these buggers and haven't regretted it for a moment. It has a permanent place on my Kindle, and I will buy every new one that comes out. It may not be for purests, but it is for those who love pinball, but don't mind it being updated and improved upon with shiny animations and cool mini games that are not always associated with pinball (ie the astroids type mission in star wars starfighter table). If you don't believe me, just download this free one. It comes with Sorcerer's Lair, which many believe is the best one of all Zen tables. If you like it, buy more. If you don't, then you are lying haha :) Just an FYI, my favorite tables are the Starfighter Assault Table, Fantastic Four, Avengers, and Epic Quest.
0062290797|4.0|This books could only loosly be described as a story.  It often meanders around a variety of stories.  On the other hand, that it much of what makes it good.  Chris Kyle really just puts down his unfiltered thoughts on paper.  Those details really open up a person's eyes as to the perspective of a soldier and particularly a navy seal.  I really enjoyed this book.  It carries you through the emotions and impact of war on a person.  Chris describes everything from excitement and elation to sadness and difficulty.  There is no question that Chris loved being a seal and he loved going to war.  This is a gritty and frank view of that.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I can continue my addiction.  Waited a long time for this.  Just as good as using on your phone.  The only drawback is you can not use your &quot;gifted&quot; boosters from friends.  Only on a PC.  Otheraise awesome game!!!!
B00280LYIM|5.0|The book was downloaded easily and a lot cheaper than driving around to look for a store or book store that carries the book.  Also able to download the series.
0385737955|5.0|I really enjoyed reading the maze runner. I can't wait to read some more books from James Dashner's collection. I would recommend this book!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing!<br />I really like this good and the whole series!... Great author. I've been hooked to every single page of this series
B0050DIWFC|5.0|....well written, surprising elements and shocking ending. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down and was very sad when it was over....I wanted more!
B00E5Q1HJS|1.0|DO NOT RECOMMEND ON WII HD PURCHASE, THE VIDEO QUALITY IS HORRIBLE AND I EVEN PURCHASED A HD CHORD FOR MY WII TO HOPEFULLY GET THE HD OF THE MOVIE BUT DID NOT HELP AT ALL.  I WILL NEVER PURCHASE MOVIES AGAIN THROUGH DIGITAL AMAZON!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|I keep on downloading the game and it keeps saying there's no more space for and I have no apps
B000RW3YYA|5.0|this dvd is great for your collection of stargate atlantis.  i love the series and i love being an owner of the complete series.
B001CXDNWG|5.0|Hey, it's the bawld man. This CD is great. Better then all that other wimpy pop stuff out on the market today. This CD has bawls!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game just have to wait too long between games,but overall a fun card game just about like the actual game.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|I just couldn't get into it. I guess I didn't have the patience to learn how to play the game..
0375714669|5.0|this book is great for courses.  and, it is great for reference.  my happy to be an owner of this book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series was very well done.  It provides drama, comedy and suspense all in one series.  I can't wait for season 4
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the ending because she got to live and she got to marry Peeta  and have children of her own. She is even living in her own district that she lived in before the hunger games.
B006DJ2JSI|1.0|I'm sorry about the rating. I can't give a rating because I can't download it onto mt Kindle Fire HD. I have tried several times. But, it just doesn't want to be on my book, But, I'm sure it's a fine dictionary.
0140135154|5.0|this book is great for courses.  and, it is great for reference.  my happy to be an owner of this book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved it! Just what the Doctor ordered! Perfect continuation of the story that started it all. Couldn't sleep until I read the whole book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its the 2nd best app I have. it has Hannah's favoret person the little baby guy is the best.my frgehyd hejjdhd hdhsh hdhhe. suj
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I liked the book. Not his best but its a good read. His Jfk book was a better book but I enjoy his reading his books.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|i like the new music, but it is not his best.  i believe that justin timberlake could have done better, but how do he come back from sexy back, which is a great cd.
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|This album definitely picks up where Revelator left off, with very much the same sort of sound. And that's a good thing, because this band has incredible talent. It is refreshing to hear music like this that is new but classic at the same time. Derek, combined with Susan and the rest of the band makes for a fantastic album. However, I think that Revelator was more intense, and that this album lacks a little of what Revelator had. Even though I prefer Revelator, this is still amazing music.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|the title can't say enought as to how boring this movie is. The plot isn't very good and the acting is below what Paul Rude can deliver. I love his movies but this one was a flop.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|A very interesting and educational book without political/power biases of the establishment. I certainly learnt a lot. I am now on to the more detailed book by Gary &#34;Good Calories Bad Calories&#34;.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|this dvd is great for your collection of stargate atlantis. i love the series and i love being an owner of the complete series.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was an interesting format and pretty much held my attention throughout the entire book.  I have to admit that the end was a little disappointing though
B004V73FGE|5.0|I love how they remade the tron environment. This movie is one of my favorites and i continue to rent this.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Excellent read really fast paced.<br />just sucks you in, feels like a book of short stories, yet the overall effect is to create a real sense of global catastrophe.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i love ebay and amazon.  when i want something or need something i go to ebay and amazon and compare prices.  ebay is cheaper because you can find what you desire from other ebayer who is selling the produce.  however, amazon ensure your purchase better or just as great as ebay in many ways.  even though, this review should be all about ebay i have to give amazon a praise also.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|This is a  great CD!  If you like music in the style of Fall Out Boy, you'll love this CD!
B00COGY2P2|4.0|This is probably one of tom cruise's best movies he has made. from the beginning to the end, this movie was entertaining. If you are into mystery and actions movies, this is the movie for you.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was great to finally have closure to a well known character. Nicely done Mr. King. Looking forward to next.
B00243FQFA|5.0|this dvd is great for your collection of stargate atlantis. i love the series and i love being an owner of the complete series.
B00E193TM2|5.0|This is a band that never ceases to amaze me. I love this CD as every other one they have put out. The funny thing is I did not really enjoy a couple of their songs off of &#34;way of the fist&#34; until I heard &#34;hard to see&#34; off of &#34; War is the answer&#34; and was instantly hooked to all of their albums. Don't know, after that song, I just could listen to EVERY album over and over again. But, this is by far my 2nd favorite to American capitalist.
B00B99QTM4|4.0|This movie is great and is what i'd do i woke up and it was the same day every day.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Kahn was originally played by Mexican actor Ricardo Montalbam.  One of the most beloved and well known villains in the entire Star Trek franchise.  Casting a skinny, blue eyed white man to play a character we are familiar with may have been the worst casting decision ever.<br /><br />What was JJ Abrams thinking?  The actor who played Kahn looked like a 99 lb. weakling.  He was totally not believable as a super villain.  J.J. Abrams will ruin Star Wars next.  I guarantee it.
6303367518|5.0|this movie was great and all acting was great.  the twist was great also.  i loved this movie and it is a realistic movie.
B000G73U5Y|5.0|Ordered for a Christmas gift.  Was pleased to be able to find without searching local stores and wasting a lot of time.  Great service, as usual.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|This move was exactly what i expected. A remake of the origional. Watch the origional. it was much better. This movie adds very little evidence of change from the origional. If you are going to make a remake, don't change a thing. Do what disney did with tron and make a movie about the aftermath.
B0035LJY6C|4.0|Its too complex of a movie for a young viewer, they tend to not understand the movie. Great for +8 yearold viewing
B00B1D7ANK|4.0|This is a very well-made toy, with excellent texturing and details. It is essentially a non-moving model, but the wings are attached by a socket and can be moved up and down. The rider can also be taken off of the dragon, although his spear is kind of stuck to his hand in a way that is difficult to take on and off.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved the book.<br />I will look at more of his books I the further.<br />I would give it 5 stars.
B0091LRZZW|5.0|This is a great concert.  My favorite Diana Krall and her fabulous orchestra, The greatest Paul McCartney without any instrument singing fabulous oldies, many from Fats Waller.  What could be better.  Great music mixed with a little history.  Wonderful!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|I did not see it; thus there really is not much i can include in this review. Have a great forever!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|App provides useful information. Like how it allows tracking of several cities in one interface. I would recommend it. The only area I would like to see improvement in is the amount of local information over general information.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I liked learning more of the backstories of the characters in this series.  Very well written. I like the fact that characters become empowered by finding out who they really are.
B0000214F0|1.0|I have no idea why some people consider this a &#34;classic.&#34; It's basically just porn with, what I guess is, a plot.
B001F12J48|1.0|Very poor quality ....didn't even watch it to a finish...........Not Blu Ray .......learned valuable lesson . The old 50's style red and green cardboard glasses were supplied , but all-in -all , a real disappointment
B00EU9VCKO|5.0|Ever wonder what your kids would have looked like if they'd had their pics taken and stuffed in a drawer for 50 years? Here's the app to let you find out.
B0082SU98U|5.0|Amazing timeless story of grace and true character.  You will fall in love with Pollyanna and her positive outlook on life.  We would all do well to play the glad game every day.
B007NU54H4|5.0|My girls love this movie about sister fairies. I love that there is no 'bad guy' or un-necessarily scary parts (finally).
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|It was a reasonable start to the season.<br />I think the suspense for the next episode is reasonable but I continue to have issue with some of the details they are selling.
B008EL25LE|5.0|When my son's arms get too tired to hold the phone, he wants me to play it so he can watch.
B001EC2ISA|4.0|I really enjoy this movie old classic  and recommend this to anyone who either wants to be scared or who wants just an old classic film from the 90s.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Poor Bridget Jones...er..Bridget Darcy. First of all, Mark is missed, very missed in this one. And Bridget's loneliness is palpable. I think she is more lonely in her 50s after knowing love and having a family than she was in her 30s. But I guess I'd expected her to grow a little. However, she seemed to be just as shallow as ever.<br /><br />It was fun to revisit her, and interesting, if totally sad, to see how it all turned out, but it wasn't a life changing book.<br /><br />I think if I wasn't currently on my own with two kids while my husband is unreachable, on a submarine, where he will be for much of the next two years, her loneliness and frustrations and fears and trials might have touched me less. Those are the parts of the book that seemed utterly real. The rest of it was some fluff (expected, as it *is* Bridget Jones) and complete inanity.<br /><br />All in all, a fun, sometimes sad read. I still can't stand that Mark is gone.
B00B8R1NP0|3.0|This is essentially a replication of many serial killer books...the hunting down of a weird, sociopathic killer. It is however well written and keeps one involved. For innovative plot, not so good. For suspense and writing skill, pretty good. Hence, a &#34;C&#34;.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is forever my favorite novel. John Green, you are amazing. Have not found a flaw in any of this. I recommend this to everyone.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|Great read! Fast, easy to follow.  I got through it in one day and found myself wanting more!  Get a copy!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A great follow on from the Shining. Dr Sleep really captured me .. I could not put it down ! A recommended read  !
B008469DGY|5.0|Fun game to pass the time. Sometimes it seems like I hit the ball to far but I'm getting better with that working on getting all scores in timed round over 100k.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for so long for this to be available on my kindle fire.  Until now I've only been able to play candy crush on my PC, this app makes it so much easier to play.  Thanks Amazon!!
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|This game is boring. The guy walks sooooo slow if you have a fast mind like me then this game is not for you thanks god  igot it when its the app of the day
B00ECKKCRK|5.0|Another GREAT CD! I Love It!!<br />They never disappoint me with their music and I'm usually a country music person.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This app is lots of fun because the puzzles are not too easy. It keeps you entertained and has an interesting story line.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Slow going at first, but after the first 100 pages I couldn't put it down! I loved revisiting some old favorites and reading about the life of Danny Torrence after The Shining.<br /><br />Well worth the read, although it is not quite as good as the original. I don't want to give anything away, but I will say it is a must for any fan of The Shining.
B00F0AI9Y4|4.0|Nice mix of different styles or genres of music. Glad I bought the whole mp3 instead of just the one popular song.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Excellently conceived, as usual. Brings closure to The Shining in a creative way, while adding a new parasite to Kings arsenal of evil. King has mellowed with age as have we all. If you're looking for the level of horror that The Shining brought you will be disappointed. When I first read The Shining I literally could not sleep - could you? Doctor Sleep, though very good, does not produce this same intensity. That being said, every &#34;Devoted Reader&#34; will love this book. Buy it, and enjoy!
B000FC1QQU|4.0|I so enjoy this lead character in how she leads her life. McCall Smith tells his story so easily ... It all just flows
B00CS9987W|5.0|Love it  I have been waiting for this movie on BluRayt and it was worth the wait.  Loaded with extras also.  Very cool
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The DVD arrived brand new, sealed in shrink wrap. The price I purchased it for was even cheaper than Best Buy! :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game on this, than I do with a pack of cards. I goes a lot faster for me.
0062200909|5.0|A must for any fan of the hobbit, lord of the rings, or especially film design! The price for this book is surprisingly affordable for the quality. Each page is printed on glossy photo paper in high definition. The book details the designs for the movie (both failed and featured) and the process of design-approval-creation. Not to mention a wonderful version of Thorin's map on the inside cover (that can be torn out(but I wouldn't recommend it)) with special raised print for the moon runes. It also comes with a printed version of Bilbo's contract in the back. I can't stress enough just how well done this book is.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|Hilarious. Dark at times, but the best laughter comes from truth. My first experience with Sadaris was barrel fever. Also a non stop laugh
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|this is my favorite game!!  I cannot get enough of the quell games.  I hope they keep making more because I am addicted!
0345803485|5.0|This is quite the book to read. It is well written yet a bit more than I really need to know!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Loved it, so glad I found it on Amazon...it wasn't going to get too Redbox until Oct 28 !!!!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!
B00000FC5H|5.0|I love earth wind and fire music.  I am so happy that they came out with a cd of their greatest hits.  Thanks for the very fast delivery service.  It is so easy to order from Amazon.  Thank you again.............Kathy Depies
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Well done, it added a  perspective of the grandness of the universe. A much bigger, and  loving view than many religions promote. I have sent many copies to friends.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love playing this game, especially when I have nothing else to do! It is so fun to play when bored.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love this tv show. I have 1-3 right now and I am making my way to the current season. I will continue to buy these tv series as long as they are making them. The dvds were not scratched at all because sometimes they slip out of there slot when being shipped but mine didn't. It was packaged tightly and was in perfect condition. It shipped really fast too! I would buy from this seller again.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|Simply the best King Kong movie ever! Never mind the remakes. This may be old, but at the time it was truly an original.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Arguably the best season of TNG!  Groundbreaking stories!  The best of both worlds is definitely the best sci-fi tv show ever made.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great with YouTube and Netflix. Unacceptable stuttering and delays when streaming from the browser. Hoping for Amazon Instant Video support SOON.
0399226907|5.0|I got this for a christmas present so I havent givin it to my child yet, but I ordered this because I learned out to read out of this and hoped this would help my youngest also learn how to read. This book was shipped with another item and they both were in great condition.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|There is only one thing I can say about this book.  It was the perfect read.  Not too easy, not too difficult.  The perfect amount of mystery, intrigue, romance, art, magic, music, and all.  Absolutely can not wait for the third book to finally arrive.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|It's nice to come out of the closet as a thoughtful introvert. The nonsense that extroversion is the &#34;preferred&#34; temperament for success has made it difficult for those of us who prefer a more serene and quiet lifestyle.<br />The next time I (reluctantly) go to a party and watch so many people trying way too hard to have a good time I'll just smile.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What an amazing story.  A creative look at a not so unrealistic future.  I can't wait to get started on the next book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting on Candy Crush to be added to Amazon and my Kindle Fire HD would finally be complete.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|played to the absurd max virtual eye candy added to the hopefully sweet revenge with unlikely outcomes still Quentin in stride
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Very interesting analysis of Jesus of Nazareth as a historical figure in the context of the political realities of life under Roman rule. Refreshing history stripped of modern day religiosity of those who use the life of Jesus for their own ideological ends.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|It's a movie about giant robots fighting giant monsters.  Don't watch it if you're expecting an Oscar winner.  It's creative, fun, and has some great action.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Get ready to laugh with this raunchy comedy featuring a bear who's past time hobby is smoking pot. How can you resist?
B009K72G8I|5.0|It's a good commercial but would have preferred an actual episode or some behind the scenes material.  Not bad not great!
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|It held my attention throughout the whole movie. And the ending is such a twist.<br />Great chick flick.<br />The characters were great. The setting was a place you wish you were there.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This is one of my all time fav. books.  It really gets you thinking about your life and leadership etc.
B002FQOI0A|3.0|This turned out to be a pretty good book. The beginning of the book was the only part that I felt could have been better. But the middle and the end were a nice way to change my opinion on the book. I would recommend this book to any one who would like a quick read or want good heavy descriptions.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Very usefull in all time.has big numbers and easy to use helps me in my dayly acounts, I love it
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was almost as good as the first two. It is a shame the author passed away before finishing all the novels because you can tell that this one leaves off with room to grow. It still had a good ending considering the idea was to have more to come, so do not fear, there is some closure.
B005GY0Y8S|3.0|The book is ok. I liked the plot, but wish the characters were more developed. Also the timeline is jerky and does not flow. There is no sense or explanation of time passing it just happens.
B0063M22QO|1.0|I actually bought this game and played for several weeks.  The next thing I know was a message stating that I had no right to this game.  It stated that I do not own it.  I knew good and well  I paid for it.  Amazon even sent me an email as always of the purchased which cleared my bank.  I was really teed off about.  Calling the company and emailing is useless.
B0037WP83M|5.0|It's a great movie love to watch it every now and then as well as the other two movies. ;)
B0015DROBO|5.0|I decided to read this after I saw the US version in theaters. I think the book was even better than the movie and I have since read it twice. Extremely well written and great story. Engaging and addictive read, I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good mystery, suspense, and thrilling read.

B004SUWR2C|2.0|I love playing, however, this game skips more than once in certain areas.  This app has many flaws in it.
B00EAIMGDW|1.0|Last time I played this game I thought my kindle  was a gonner and I would never get it restarted.  I've been reading the reviews and I can't tell by  them if anything has changed for the better   concerning this game (?), still seems like alot  of crashing or complaining about excessive data  mining.. So I don't know, and in light of that  here's my pick for today: 10/21 called    JACOBS LADDER - no permissions, unique gameplay.   This is really a fun and unique game with NO  permissions or junkware added and the dev. him-  self wants it that way (check out his forward).  There is a free version (no ads anything) and  paid version (more levels etc.) for c99. which  I will be purchasing soon.. This is one of those  developers we all should support...  for some Halloween scares check out:  DUNGEON NIGHTMARES and 5 Nights at Freddys    ZM - 10/21/14    ________________    I was playing along and got to the cheesy level and it crashed  my kindle fire 2nd edition.    One second I was playing and the next the kindle fire screen  came up like it was starting/restarting but never did anything,  so I hit the button to restart it manually and the screen went  blank and i thought I would never get it back on, but after about  5 minutes of cursing and pressing the button I finally got it to  come back on and needless to say REMOVED the game after  that.  Next thing I'm going to do is run a full virus scan on the kindle.    Anyone else have a problem like this?    zm

B008J34466|5.0|I love Pink anyway, but I will admit some of the vulgarity is offensive in this album. Worse than any of her others. So I just sort of block it out and listen to the sound.
B00BHHIWQO|1.0|This game is worthless for Kindle Fire.  I have downloaded a dozen times.  I have been ripped off of my m o net as well.  I went to the free download and same results.  Rating should be a zero I n my book.

B007VTUYWW|3.0|Treasure hunting, ancient evil, ridiculous situations, sexy hero. But it's an action movie, what do you expect? Think Indiana Jones, but less believable. Plenty of action, fun to watch with the kids.
B000GY729M|4.0|As with all Killers albums, this one is great. Its a must have for those who have heard the radio played songs, but have yet to hear the album as a whole. It brings a new perspective to the &#34;hits&#34;.
B0031TZ98K|5.0|In respect of our newest Nobel prize winner I decided I  needed to read at least one of her books. The title called out to me.  I guess I was looking for a happy book.  From the first short story on, you quickly find out that it is not happiness but something dark that lurks in every tale.  I listened to a Peter Gzowski interview with her on CBC radio and found the author to be a perfectly delightful humble Canadian. Despite my illogical antipathy to short stories ( if this was so good , why not make a real story out of it), I have to say I read this book with relish. I was able to put my latent misogyny well away, replacing it with a delight in skillful prose.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I could not be happier with this purchase.  Super fast acquisition of signal and works indoors as well as out. This was the last part of a laptop chartplotter for the boat and it works like a charm.
B004FS1TLM|5.0|I love this album so much I have bought at least 8 of them to give as gifts.  I listen to it all the time and it makes me feel happy.  In my opinion he is the finest singer there is.
B00FQAZ7PW|4.0|Great album! Luv it. There's one song though from Eddie Vedder's last solo album that they remade for Pearl Jam, though it sounds good, I wish they'd left it alone. The original sounds better. Other than that, solid album.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|Mixed feelings about this book! I read it at the recommendation of a friend. After the first chapter I decided not to read anymore. Then I deci ded to read one more chapter, then on  more chapter... then was invested in the story! So, I guess I have to say I enjoyed it! Now comes the decision...do I read the next book?
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|I'm a dedicated Stephen King fan. I've read everything he has written but this was awful. If this is all he can churn out then he needs to think about retiring.
1591843790|3.0|There are a few relevant points made in this book, but much of it is too focused on perceptions and manipulation for my taste. This book will not have a permanent place on my shelf.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love the story of Christian and Ana. Such a beautiful disaster. Can't wait to see what happens in book three.
0985557834|5.0|This is a pretty cool book, it has many different styles of bracelet styles, and very nice illustrations. The pouche and other utility ties are really useful. Over all a pretty nice book to learn paracord ties.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I don't usually care for sequels, but this one is well done. It builds on the Shining without “heavily borrowing” from it. Classic King.
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|First album where I love every song at first listen. Getaway, Infallible, Pendulum and zlet the Record Play are my favorites in that order.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved The Shinning and was thrilled to get to see what happened to Danny and the rest when he grew up.

B00EDOS6IC|5.0|If this is what happens when the band takes a small break (Miles with Slash and the Band with Creed) then great. This cd sounds fantastic. If you are a Alter Bridge fan, you wont be disappointed. It might be (or not) their best,  but I have yet to listen to a bad AB CD. Enjoy!

B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is probably one of the best photo editing apps! I had an old HTC Thunderbolt smartphone which had great photo editing software and now I have a Samsung galaxy note 2 which photo editing software sucks. I've been searching for good photo editing app and I finally found it! I highly suggest for anyone that takes pictures of landscapes, high speeds moving objects, or pics at night or in dark surroundings and wants to use color saturation or photo brightness editing tools!

B009JZWO3I|5.0|I have watched the entire 4 Seasons of The Good Wife and am now into the 3rd Episode of the 5th Season. It has at times gotten a little racy but all in all I have enjoyed watching. It is difficult to find things to watch these days and this is one I have chosen to keep up on.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Hooked on the series !  The whole family has read it and this year it was required summer reading !!
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Action packed movie with a good story line.  It is definitely worth watching.  Looking forward to the next one coming out.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Enjoyable, but not highly suspensful. I truly enjoy the Scarpetta series and will always buy the next book. I'm hooked. How does Cornwell come up with these wierd ways to murder people?
B008CLI4N4|5.0|We don't have HBO so I'd read the books and heard the hype. The show was done quite well, enjoyed it very much, now I need to order season 2
B008P76UKE|3.0|To start you need to know I've been hooked on the Ring cycle for over 35 years. I know what note follows the previous note. My mind plays the music inside itself. Wagner was a master of transitions, from one scene to the next, and this is where this performance fails. There are no transitions. This recording abruptly jumps from one theme to the next, and is somewhat nerve racking in its incompleteness. I had watched this complete program on Youtube before I bought it, so I knew what I was getting. I wanted to hear this with the Blu-ray audio. I was very impressed with the audio on the Met's new Ring production. This recording makes me wish the Met productions Blu-ray, had an orchestral track only, Yes all 15 hours of it! My love of Wagner's music began with the prelude to Act 3 of Lohengrin, which strangely enough was part of the sound track for the Beatles movie \\"Help\\".
B003K15IF8|5.0|The language is superb, the characters are fully developed. It was a pleasure from the first to the last page. I am reccommending this book to all my friends.
B0036SUQWA|5.0|One of the most interesting and funny movies with such a great cast.  Wish Amazon had made it clear it couldn't be downloaded to my non-Apple Smartphone before I ordered it.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I first read the children's version and thought it was good, so I decided to read the adult version. GREAT READ! Very sad towards the middle but gets better during the end. Calling all dog people,this book is for you. Just be prepared for sadness and death in the middle. 4-5 stars.

B005GI0NWQ|5.0|Much more entertaining than the original soundtrack and is a delight for almost any lover of Bluegrass. The added content will not disappoint.
B00DHNBPA6|5.0|Love this just as much as the original (I usually hate remakes) also the first movie to ever actually scare me highly recommend for any fan of the original series.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|After finishing of \\"The Name of the Wind\\" I am at a loss. I have heard a lot of hype about it and being a hardcore fantasy fan wanted to wait it our a little. Especially after such mind numbing comparisons as \\"Martin meets Rowling\\" (shudders).<br />It is hard to give one mark for the book which leaves you stunned. But I shall try:<br /><br />1. I was stunned of the beauty of the language. Rhythm, sounds, details - everything adds up. Mythology is painstakingly and lovingly created, magic system or \\"sympathy\\" is almost perfect. Hero is enigmatic, interesting and not always lovable. The book was fresh and beautiful. Six stars.<br /><br />2. I was stunned of how little did happen in such a big book and how everything slows down to a crawl bogged by the almost unmanageable heap of non-essential and non-plot driving events. It seems like the author fell in love with his written voice and just cannot stop. Two stars.<br /><br />I have moved to the next book in series immediately but my doubts about the reason #2 still linger.
B00EO10M54|5.0|This is not the first time Miley Cyrus has tried to re-invent herself as an artist.  I've been a fan of Miley since her Hannah Montana days, and her career trajectory has been an interesting one.  After recording four albums as Hannah Montana, and releasing the clichéd-but-genuinely-enjoyable teen pop album \\"Breakout\\", and getting her first #2 hit on the adult pop chart with \\"Party in the U.S.A.\\", she tried distance herself from her teen idol image with the album \\"Can't Be Tamed\\".  There was one huge problem with \\"Can't Be Tamed\\": it wasn't very good.  None of the songs were memorable, her voice was straining on most of the tracks, it wasn't authentic or believable, and it seemed like she was trying too hard to rebel while neglecting to focus on making enjoyable music.<br /><br />Being a smart person, Miley must have realized the album didn't have its intended effect.  So she took some time off and worked toward her second attempt.  She started experimenting with different kinds of music to redefine her sound and decide what type of artist she wanted to be.  She started going out to popular clubs and seeing type of music people wanted to listen to.  She moved around the country a few times, moved outside her social bubble and became friends with artists and producers she wouldn't have normally interacted with.  She tried her hand at acting in a few films.  She fell in love, and went through heartbreak.  She cut her signature long brown hair into a pixie cut.  And then finally, she released the song \\"We Can't Stop.\\"<br /><br />I had mixed feelings about \\"We Can't Stop\\", which was originally intended for Rihanna.  When I saw the video, I thought the lyrics were a bit shallow, and I was somewhat disappointed that she chose to go the R&B/urban-punk direction rather than the laid-back country feel she had on her Backyard Sessions.  I did think the video was entertaining, even though I did have the same problems some other bloggers had with all the black women being awkwardly crammed into one scene.  Ultimately, I did think the song was catchy and had a good beat, so I was patient enough to wait and see what else was on the album.  Then, when she released \\"Wrecking Ball\\", I was completely sold.  I had to buy her new album.<br /><br />I did not regret the decision.  \\"Bangerz\\" is an album too fun to put down.  Every single song is a hit.  You can tell from listening to it that Miley is clearly enjoying herself without taking herself too seriously, and even if you don't like her, the songs are catchy and high-energy enough to make you get up and dance.  The album is very well-produced, and though Miley's voice isn't the highlight of the album, it still shines on every track.  \\"Bangerz\\" succeeds on every front.<br /><br />A track by track review:<br /><br />1. \\"I Adore You\\"- Miley opens the album with a love song for Liam.  The song has a very mellow R&B feeling to it, with some floaty/dreamy background music.  If you took the song \\"Happy\\" from Natasha Bedingfield's second album, and recorded Monica's vocals over it, it might sound a little like this song.  It was an odd choice not to open the album with a dance song, but this is still decent and enjoyable.  4/5<br /><br />2. \\"We Can't Stop\\"- The lyrics are pretty shallow, but everyone knows this song is pretty catchy.  4.5/5<br /><br />3. \\"SMS (Bangerz)\\"- The title track.  This one is so fun.  How can you not love a collaboration with Britney Spears?  \\"You tell me that you love me, I ain't foolin' with that.  They ask me how I keep a man, I keep a battery pack!\\"  5/5<br /><br />4. \\"4X4\\"- This collaboration with Nelly makes me want to go line-dancing.  Since I've never encountered a song that makes me want to do that, it must be special.  The lyrics are really clever too.  She says four-by-four and away we go, I say five-by-five and replay the song.  5/5<br /><br />5. \\"My Darlin'\\"- Miley tells her darlin' to \\"Stand by Me\\".  Which reminds me of the 60s song, except not as good.  The beats are nice, the non stand-by-me lyrics are original, and the echo effects are interesting, but this song hasn't grown on me yet.  If I was Miley, I might have moved this track to the Deluxe edition, replaced it with I Adore You, and opened with We Can't Stop.  2.5/5<br /><br />6. \\"Wrecking Ball\\"- The strongest song Miley has ever released.  Her vocals are the best they've ever been, and you can feel the raw passion of her exposing herself. 5/5<br /><br />7. \\"Love, Money, Party\\"- This song is pretty much SMS part 2.  It's just as fun to dance to, except Big Sean isn't as cool as Britney. 4/5<br /><br />8. \\"#GETITRIGHT\\"- This whistle on this song is ridiculously catchy.  The vibe reminds me of Mariah Carey's Dreamlover, except this song is so upbeat it makes me want to skip through a meadow or something.  And it \\"Makes my tongue go do-do-do\\".  4.5/5<br /><br />9. \\"Drive\\"- My second favorite song on the album, because it shows Miley's maturity and range.  Her voice shines on the line \\"Cause I don't want to leave home without your love\\", and it keeps getting better from there.  Seriously, go listen to this.  5/5<br /><br />10. \\"FU\\"- A really fun angry song to Liam. I hope she releases it as a single.  Miley has two letters to say to him.  One of them is F.  You can guess what the other letter is.  5/5<br /><br />11. \\"Do My Thang\\"- Miley is doing her thing.  The rapping is a nice touch \\"You know I'm a southern belle, crazier than hell.\\"  4/5<br /><br />12. \\"Maybe You're Right\\"- The chorus to the song is catchier than the verses.  But I can't help but sing along to it.\\"You might think I'm crazy, that I'm lost and foolish leaving you behind. Maybe you're right.\\" I like to think the song is a double dig at Liam and the Hannah Montana fans who she left behind by growing up.  4/5<br /><br />13. \\"Someone Else\\"- Seems like another dig at both Liam and her fans.  Miley is someone else now.  She's a completely different artist.  And thank goodness she is.  4/5<br /><br />Overall, I definitely recommend Bangerz.  However, I recommend the standard edition rather than the deluxe version; the extra three songs aren't really worth it.  But on the standard edition, number of potential hits on the album in proportion to the number of songs is as high as 8/13, and usually all I need to buy an album is 3 good songs. I commend Miley for breaking out of her mold and taking some risks to make a top notch urban pop punk album. A+ effort.

B005WBBYXO|2.0|I read this trilogy because they're &#34;classic&#34; sci-fi/fantasy stories for young adults. I somehow missed reading them growing up, so I figured I'd pick them up.<br />The writing is awful. Things that are meant to be important are hardly mentioned or thrown in irregularly. Pullman seems to keep the same pace while writing about the most mundane things and the most exciting.<br />I have a tendency to get bored while reading, so if I think I can predict where an idea is going, I'll just skip to the next paragraph or something. With these books, he'll be talking about the most boring thing ever in a paragraph that appears to stretch on for a page and a half, so I casually think I can skip a few lines, but all of a sudden a bear has appeared and now they're fighting a snake and someone's arm is missing and the boat has capsized and everyone is really upset that someone doesn't have a daemon.<br />What makes this worse is that the omnibus includes &#34;lamp slides&#34; which are sort of vignettes of the world outside of the story and the realm of &#34;what's important.&#34; That's not so terrible in itself, it's an interesting addition. What's bad about it is that they're prefaced by Pullman stating something about how now that the book has been published he can't change anything about it or that his story is perfect as it is and it doesn't need these additions. Which is just so arrogant and so awful. And it enrages me because his book is FILLED with useless information and he says they're just right the way they are, don't add anymore useless information? Whatever.<br />The part of the story I was found most enjoyable was a single subplot in the third book. I spent all of the Amber Spyglass wanting to know more about that subplot and I just couldn't get enough of what was happening to this specific set of characters. I'm not sure if it would have been better to have just that story as the entire series... While it would make for a better standalone story, I see that subplot in the third book as my reward for getting through the first two books.at subplot in the third book as my reward for getting through the first two books.

B009NH6JRE|4.0|More than seven months after being forced to flee Herschel's farm, Rick Grimes and the group he leads are tired, ragged and badly in need of shelter and a place to relax. Stumbling across an abandoned prison, they set about clearing it of walkers and turning it into a base of operations. Meanwhile, Andrea, separated from the rest of the group, has hooked up with a sword-wielding loner named Michonne (who uses 'neutralised' walkers - with their arms and jaws removed - to carry supplies). They find an apparent safe haven in the town of Woodbury, run by the apparently well-meaning 'Governor'. But it isn't long before Rick's group and the Governor's followers run into one another, setting the scene for a major confrontation and testing the loyalties of those in both groups.<br /><br />The Walking Dead is a contradictory series. On the one hand, it's often compulsive viewing. It's more ruthless to its characters even than Game of Thrones and Lost (the latter of which it is beginning to resemble more and more) and the show puts a pleasing emphasis on taking common sense precautions against the zombie threat (although it's not above using individual moments of implausible stupidity for dramatic gain). On the other, it often promises more than it delivers and the first two seasons both had a tendency to deploy filler material. The third season is an attempt to tackle these issues and play to the strengths of the premise whilst not getting bogged down so much. Unfortunately, this was sabotaged from the get-go by AMC's demand that the season be extended to sixteen episodes, which turns out to be about four too long.<br /><br />The series starts off promisingly. The delayed discovery of the prison (which we saw in the final shot of Season 2 close to Rick's group but it's taken seven months of them going round in circles to get back to it) and the need to clear it out provides a lot of dramatic impetus in the early episodes. Splitting the group, getting Andrea and Michonne to Woodbury and a dramatic reunion with a missing former member of their group all provide strong storytelling opportunities. The introduction of the Governor, played with relish by David Morrissey, is well-handled and giving Rick a nemesis and someone to bounce off is a great idea. The first half of the season is indeed The Walking Dead at its best, featuring some rich scenes of character development and even some satisfying action scenes (even if the ease with which walkers are now being dispatched compared to earlier seasons is starting to get a little silly).<br /><br />Things deteriorate rapidly in the second half. Some rather bizarre wheel-spinning kicks in and we get a face-to-face confrontation between Rick and the Governor which really doesn't do anything, as well a completely pointless episode featuring two characters playing cat-and-mouse in an abandoned warehouse. As more excuses are found to delay the big finale battle, things get less and less plausible until scenes that were supposed to be powerfully tragic become instead rather comical. There's also less focus on the day-to-day details of living with the walker threat; in the final episode people are casually leaving gates open and walking past biters without too much care. The second half of the season does retain some dramatic highlights, such as Carl Grimes graduating from 'pointlessly hanging-around kid' to 'PTSD-suffering child soldier' and the intriguing arrival of Tyreese (played by The Wire's Chad Coleman), but it's a far cry from the opening half.<br /><br />Ultimately, the third season of The Walking Dead (****) is watchable, entertaining and features some very strong dramatic scenes and elements in its first half. The second half is more disappointing, featuring significant lapses in plot logic and characterisation. If anything, whilst the second season (which was a little too static) benefited a lot from being viewed in rapid-fire on Blu-Ray, the third season suffers, with the longueurs in the second half being far more incongruous than if viewed from week to week.e second half being far more incongruous than if viewed from week to week.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that Amazon finally has Candy Crush available in the app store!! I only started playing this game a few weeks ago but I'm already addicted to candy swiping. Now I don't have to try to kick my husband off his IPad every time I want to play! For those of you who have never played the game, I highly recommend trying it out!
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|Here's the thing, I think Karl Urban is an amazing actor. And, the cast has some great talented actors and actresses but it was lacking. That said, this is a perfect movie, if your looking for a mindless, shoot'em up action movie. The film itself feels rushed. There was no character developement, so I never felt a connection, to any of them, not even, Dredd.

B00EAIMGDW|5.0|Tiny Thief is a point-and-click adventure game that at first glance, looks like it's geared for little kids with its cute character design. But once I played through the first couple stages, I was hooked! It's a very well designed game with beautiful animation and artwork. The point and click interface is very intuitive and works very well. You play as a mini-me version of Robinhood, going around town \\"borrowing\\" stuff while avoiding the medieval popos. You even have a cool little ferret as your sidekick!<br /><br />Even if you have absolutely no clue what the game is about, like I did when I started it for the first time, you will pick it up very quickly after playing through the elegantly designed and very entertaining tutorial. Each tutorial stage introduces you to a new facet of the game, and the puzzles get progressively more challenging. The overarching story is told through funny and lighthearted graphical cutscenes between stages, a la the Angry Birds franchise. The music is also nicely done and adds greatly to the game's lighthearted feel. If you get stomped by a puzzle, you can \\"cheat\\" by opening the Book of Hints (top right corner), but you can only do this once very 4 hours. It's a nice feature that should cut down on the potential frustration level, and the time limit prevents you from cheating your way through and spoiling the game.<br /><br />The only permission required is for network access, which presumably is used for the links that take you to the game's youtube, twitter and facebook pages. The permission may also be used for ads for other Rovio products. Personally I have yet to see any ad while playing the game, but I guess this could possibly change down the road so keep that in mind.<br /><br />All in all, the game is very well put together. Very polished effort at version 1.0! The only complaint is... the game's length - more levels please! :) The game is worth every penny, and as the Free-App-of-the-Day, it's a downright steal!

0739489542|5.0|I started The Camel Club series and fully intend to get to reading every book.  I've grown to really like the characterization of all our main characters enough that I'm drawn into the stories.  To me, that makes a really good book.  The reading is easy and well done.  And old Oliver just keeps getting deeper and deeper into deep s___ with his personality.  What a great assassin character - and smart thank goodness.  Have already begun Divine Justice which just picks up right where this stopped.  Good series for series lovers - and do start with The Camel Club and follow in order for better storyline!

B00EKWTLUO|4.0|Ramin Djawadi has always been composing amazing music. He has the ability to adapt to pretty much any story and setting. From Ask The Dust, Beat The Drum, the Medal Of Honor video game reboots, Game Of Thrones to Iron Man he's always adapting. The score for Pacific Rim is exactly what you'd expect for this kind of movie. It's a \\"balls to the wall\\" action score at times, but it also has many layers. This isn't a wallpaper score and in fact it's quite good and quite entertaining.<br /><br />The first thing that Djawadi fans will recognize are the similarities between his Iron Man score and this. Yes, he brings the rock aspect in first and honestly it's awesome. The theme is great, catchy and sets the groundwork for what's to come. There is a lot of music here and it's structured very well. After our rockstar intro we get some more setup and even some beautiful emotions in the track \\"Mako\\". Once all hell breaks loose Djawadi brings in the big orchestral sounds mixed in with some synths and percussion. Near the halfway point we get some fantastic choral work. It gives the score a sense of grandeur and doom. The deep male chorus full of grunts and chants also give the film a rough masculinity. Let's be honest here, not many females are gonna be clamoring to see robots fight monsters. The movie and score both have their boyish charm that will reawaken the giddy 12-year old boy in anyone, maybe even the ladies who knows? The best part of the score is that it has many other fun melodies worked into it so it never becomes dull or one-note. It's a fun ride all the way though.<br /><br />Pacific Rim is a very fun score from Ramin Djawadi. It shows his versatility to adapt and infuse his style into anything. A lot of people will criticize the use of electric guitars and there's no pleasing those people. So no point in arguing. Let them sit in their rocking chairs on their porches and yell about how scores should be, if you ignore them then they will fade away. This is how a score for an epic monster movie should be, and every moment was a blast.re for an epic monster movie should be, and every moment was a blast.

I am on the 3rd season and only have one more which upsets me  The writing is superb and the acting is great. Both the main cast and the supporting cast. This is what lifts it from just a soap to a enjoyable programm
B00CMB8MXC|4.0|Despicable Me was the world's introduction to Illumination Entertainment and gave Universal a surprising contender in the world of animated films. It had great characters, a fun story, but it also had tons of heart. Pharrell Williams was also brought on to do the score and it was his first time doing a film. The score was credited as music by Pharrell Williams and Heitor Pereira. Heitor of course is a skilled composer who has worked on tons of projects including Riding In Cars With Boys, It's Complicated, Real Women Have Curves, Illegal Tender, Running The Sahara and many more. He's also worked on many of Hans Zimmer's scores as a musician and additional composer. Pharrell and Heitor worked together on the score of the first film, but it was Pharrell's first time working on a score so you can be sure he leaned heavily on Heitor. For the second film Heitor has solo scoring duties as Pharrell only focuses on the songs. The end result is a wonderful blending of two ingredients. While the songs are catchy and great hooks, it's the score that truly shines here for Despicable Me 2.<br /><br />Heitor Pereira has always had a light and sensible approach to his scores for family films. From The Smurfs to Curious George to Beverly Hills Chihuahua he knows how to make the score specifically for the film. The same goes for the two Despicable Me films. This film's score has more focus, a deeper imprint of the characters and a more graspable structure. He echoes the melody of Pharrell's Despicable Me song throughout the score and it becomes the very subtle central theme. Throughout the journey we get a dose of different world sounds and styles. There's the slight accent of 60's jazz here and there to fuel the Bond-esque super villain sound. We visit some different nationalities including a hispanic touch to the music for El Macho, which also has some clever use of chorus. The heart of the film is always present, which gives the score its identity. The scope of the film isn't large and it's a bit more zany and cartoony than say How To Train Your Dragon. So, there's no point in comparing it to a grand score such as that. We are treated to some nice long tracks that really play out the story. There is a sense of weight and danger but just ever so slightly. The score isn't fluff though and adds significance to the characters' journey. In no way is Despicable Me 2 a \\"kiddy\\" score. Heitor does a fantastic job delivering a journey worth taking over and over. The score imprints itself to the film and echoes it wonderfully.<br /><br />The style and sound of the music reminds me of family comedies of the 90's or even light PG-13 romantic comedies. It has that warmth and sparkle that makes it very appealing, but in no way is it a generic sound. Despicable Me 2 is a much stronger score from Heitor Pereira than the first outing. With Pharrell Williams dedicated solely to the songs it seems Heitor had a better grasp and focus on the whole thing. The score has an identity and a very inviting soundscape. Despicable Me 2 is a nice charismatic fun time that shines through a summer full of bombast.e and it's a bit more zany and cartoony than say How To Train Your Dragon.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally!<br />Thank you so much for finally getting Candy Crush Saga for my Kindle Fire HD!<br />I love this game, I don't want to, but it keeps calling me back to it! I am hooked, just like the rest of the world!
B00E7NIMZ6|5.0|Hans Zimmer is having an incredibly busy year churning out some amazing scores with no signs that he's spreading himself too thin. He reunited with directors he has worked with many times before and even started new collaborations. Rush sees Hans reuniting with director Ron Howard. The pair have turned out amazing work on films like Backdraft, The Da Vinci Code, Frost/Nixon, Angels & Demons and The Dilemma. It's amazing how different directors push a composer into new creative territory. For Rush we see Hans departing the dark broody sound we've heard from his scores to Nolan's films. We see him depart big orchestral thematic romps like he did for The Lone Ranger. Here we get a high energy score steeped in a deep character story. Last time we heard Hans in this territory was for Tony Scott's Days Of Thunder, but here we get a more character driven score. It's fast, energetic, aggressive and it'll give you chills within the first minute.<br /><br />This score starts off with a wonderful establishing track. It gives us the main theme in its full glory, and then we depart from it for a while. We then spend the first half of this score setting up the characters of James and bringing in his rival with Niki. Zimmer goes for an almost rock band approach really giving the rockstar attitude to the characters and the sport. The music immerses us in the culture and lifestyle. The musical style also subtly establishes our time period of the late 70's. And even though it has a rock band feel it never feels like a performance. The narrative is being pushed every step of the way. The soundtrack has some iconic songs peppered in to really ground the time period so the score doesn't have to dip too much into that style. As the story progresses the music goes a bit deeper into the psyche of the men, their testosterone fueled rivalry and what really drives them. That \\"on top of the world\\" feeling disappears and we the listener are placed between the midst of the complex rivalry that centers the film. That achingly beautiful theme we heard in the first track reappears in the final act. The deep cello notes penetrate the chirping synths and rhythmic percussion like a knife. The theme sends chills down your spine, and the wonderful part is how beautifully simple it is. Hard propulsive percussion is immediately followed by quieter shifting tones and textures. The score never has a predictable trajectory, but the flow takes you exactly where you want to go. I always state that Hans knows how to build a track better than anyone I've ever heard. I always find myself holding my breath at moments, goosebumps slowly raising and eyes watering. He is the ultimate dramatist and knows exactly how to build the story and scene musically. Everything builds to the ultimate climax in \\"Lost But Won\\" a track that is nothing but pure Zimmer. We find our resolution in the final track as the story closes.<br /><br />Rush is a tremendous score that strives in its simplicity. Hans pinpoints the focus of the two central characters' relationship to really push this score in fantastic directions. The music starts off merely to set the stage for the tremendous second half. Hans lets loose with some rock stylings that perfectly echo the world these characters live in. The characters' competitive desires are reflected in the score and really lets the music soar emotionally. The final few tracks are pure Zimmer and end the journey in a grand emotionally riveting fashion. This is a score that stands out for its distinctive soundscape yet undeniable Zimmer style, and shouldn't be missed.enters the film.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Music is an amazing thing. It's one of those things that is unique to us as a species and it's our greatest form of communication. Anyone can understand music, and that's amazing. The world of scores is where music lives. And in that world there happens to be a composer named Hans Zimmer. You may see my Zimmer reviews as biased being that he's my favorite composer, and he's the reason why when I was 9 I wanted to become a filmmaker. But I take every review as seriously as I can, and when I say that Man Of Steel may be one of Hans Zimmer's most intensely engaging action scores I truly mean it.<br /><br />The score starts off immediately with the central theme, which is the theme everyone heard in the trailers. It is that heroic theme that sets the groundwork for what's to come. What follows is a supremely intense emotional ride. The percussion on the next track \\"Oil Rig\\" is heart-pounding. The percussion will remind Zimmer fans of Black Hawk Down where it exists in a slower form, but here Zimmer turns the intensity up to 11. What I noticed immediately at the beginning of the score is how much of Clark's character is embedded in the music. The haunting female vocal reminds us of Clark's origins, his parents and home. The track \\"Goodbye My Son\\" is a painfully beautiful lullaby. Hans can then take Clark's theme and with that piano motif create a sense of want; a desire to escape isolation. Zimmer has found Superman's weakness, and he expresses it through the score. We see it and we feel it. It's painfully beautiful. There is also the motif heard in \\"DNA\\", and it creates this mysterious backstory that slowly reveals itself. It's simple, has a commanding presence but has a layer of ambiguous motivation behind it. The two central motifs eventually merge in \\"This Is Clark Kent\\", an amazing moment. Then in a stunning moment in \\"Flight\\" the motif first heard in \\"DNA\\" reveals itself to be part of Clark's theme. Zod's motif emerges perfectly throughout the score to create another opposition that tries to suffocate Clark Kent's journey. The emotional passages in this score are so simple yet they echo so strongly. This has always been Zimmer's greatest strength; painting emotion through simplicity. He has the ability to find the notes that matter, which connect us to the characters.<br /><br />Now the action side of this score is a beast of its own. The action cues are pure Zimmer but they are so damn perfectly structured. They are also as grand and loud as can be. The sense of danger, risk of loss and weight of the conflict is always there. The central themes are molded throughout. There is always a sense of danger that makes the music matter, you fear failure while listening to this music. I don't know how that happens, but it does. The motifs battle each other and you're rooting for the hero to emerge and right all the wrongs. Your hairs are raised and you have goosebumps all over. The track \\"Terraforming\\" is a nearly 10-minute track that ranks among the composer's best. It's a jaw-dropping sequence of music. The music flows as naturally as it could, you can't imagine it going anywhere else than where it does go. There is just something special about what Hans can do. His unbelievable ability to connect you to an emotion, a thought, a character, a sequence, a story.<br /><br />The final track is that \\"stepping into the light\\" moment, where everything shows itself and is resolved. The music soars and there is not an ounce of sarcasm or intent for that to be a pun. The grandeur behind it is as inspiring as anything you will hear. This is a different kind of masterstroke than what Hans did for The Dark Knight trilogy. With all the darkness we see in real life we finally have something that shines a light on humanity. Man Of Steel is a mesmerizing character journey through extreme obstacles that ends speeding towards new heights. It's easy to lose yourself in this music and forget it's a score to a film, you might just see your own life journey for a moment.<br /><br />The two-disc limited edition comes with a bonus disc of suites and sketches that show the building blocks of this momentous piece of work. No one should hesitate to experience what Hans Zimmer has cooked up for Man Of Steel. It's emotionally rich and character driven scores of action grandeur like this that come along now and then to remind us why film music is the best music.ney for a moment.<br /><br />The two-disc limited edition comes with a bonus disc of suites and sketches that show the building blocks of this momentous piece of work.

B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|I remember sitting down with my Playstation in 1999 and playing a video game called Medal Of Honor. Beyond the gameplay, WWII setting and long nights with friends playing till 1am there was the music. That's how I was introduced to Michael Giacchino. Ever since then I have listened, watched him grow as a composer, watch him accept his Oscar and he continues to move and thrill me with his work. Nothing has changed since 1999. Giacchino is still one of the most thrilling and talented auteurs working in the music industry, and his music continues to do wonders. Star Trek: Into Darkness sees Michael re-teaming with J.J. Abrams for their 4th picture together. Don't forget they also worked on two shows as well (Alias and LOST). The first Star Trek was a big, loud and thunderously exhilarating score. It also had heart and emotion. Giacchino made Star Trek his own as his themes and motifs took shape yet he still paid tribute to the past with Alexander Courage & Gene Roodenberry's original TV theme. The score was pure Giacchino, and it made the film an absolutely entertaining blast. Now Giacchino returns to the Star Trek universe with Star Trek: Into Darkness. This time the score is even stronger as it relies less on the bold themes and more on structure. It has heart and it's a riveting listen.<br /><br />Star Trek has in incredible musical history from the TV series to the films. With composers like Courage, Horner, Goldsmith and many more adding their voice it makes it easier for a new composer to make it their own. As Giacchino brings us back into the world we immediately dive right into the plot. Cumberbatch plays Khan in the film and Giacchino gives him a brilliantly simple theme that is just perfect. The theme blends into the score very well and it's not overpowering in a way that calls attention to itself. It allows the character to define itself instead of the music defining it. This isn't \\"The Imperial March\\" or the Joker's theme here, which is great. The score relies less on the main theme this time around allowing it to feel like a legitimate extension of the first one yet still reminding us this is Star Trek. \\"The Kronos Wartet\\" (hilarious track title) is a fantastic track that brings in a chorus and really creates a deep and heavy sound while still being propulsive. Just listening to the flow of the music is stunning. The music goes where it naturally should but Giacchino always adds the ups and downs to make it constantly engaging. Everything wraps up nicely in a similar fashion to how the first film's score wrapped up.<br /><br />Star Trek: Into Darkness is a fantastic orchestral romp through space. The music is deeper and more rounded this time. It gives a sense of weight to the film's plot and adds the epic scope that J.J. Abrams was going for. The score is always energetic with an organic emotional current running through it all. Unfortunately the album only runs for about 44-minutes, which is a shame. This is exactly what happened last time, but we got a limited edition 2-disc set for Star Trek 1. So I'm hoping the same will happen. I could get into a long rant about how recording in The United States always leads to disappointingly short albums (higher prices, fees and royalties for orchestras), but will not. I'm sure it makes sense financially to release a 44-minute album and then a limited issue expanded release, but it shouldn't be that way. Anyway, here's hoping this sells well and we get an expanded release in the future. For now we can enjoy Michael's terrific work in this compressed version, which is still superb.ies less on the main theme this time around allowing it to feel like a legitimate extension of the first one yet still reminding us this is Star Trek. \\"The Kronos Wartet\\" (hilarious track title) is a fantastic track that brings in a chorus and really creates a deep and heavy sound while still being propulsive.

0060989157|2.0|It never ceases to amaze me how these pop-metal hair bands from the 80's think that they are so special and they have experienced something that no other band in the world has experienced.  Motley Crue isn't the only 80's band that is guilty of it....but they seem to be the most vocal about it.  Other than the specific childhood stories....this book could have been written about any hair band.<br /><br /> News-flash for Motley Crue and their gullible fans :  We already know that the world is full of young, slutty groupies that would have sex with a Saint Bernard if you through a guitar around it's neck! You are NOT the only band that has engaged in rampant alcohol and drug abuse!  You are not special!  Rock and pop bands have been having sex with slutty groupies since the 1950's!  The ugly-ass bastards in Bachman Turner Overdrive and Dr. Hook can tell these same stories!  It's been rumored that Stevie Wonder has had every single STD known to man, except for HIV, all caught from slutty groupies in every city across the country.<br /><br />Instead of rehashing these tired-ass stories over and over again....why don't you explain to your fans why you haven't put out a decent album in over ten years (?)

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so happy this finally came out.  Glad to be rid of the alternative dowloaded version ,only app loaded from alternative source on my device.am on level 256 and didn't have to start over. now hopefully amazon will start being more strict with all these knock off version of games like this in the app store.  ridiculous so many are aloud to be on sale ripping people off. Thanx amazon finally!
B000V6583C|5.0|An old album that is still a current. I recommend this album to anyone who luvs rock music and is not afraid.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Downloaded because it was free app of the day, and wanted to check it out because it's from angry bird makers and was a little surprised what a cute game it is.  Did just get through a few levels but enjoy this game very much.  Props to amazon for making it free app of the day.  Props to rovio for another great game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is really fun it's good for your pleasure and free time I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good puzzle game
B001XUH69Y|5.0|First time watching Casablanca, and I honestly don't know why it took me so long. It's worth watching for at least two reasons:<br /><br />First of all, it is legitimately one of the greatest films ever made. Secondly, it is so heavily referenced to this day that without watching it, you will be missing out on or at least misunderstanding countless movies, shows, etc. that reference moments from this film.<br /><br />Definitely worth your two hours.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|I love this game there was no emoji for a kindle but now there is so I can play it
076115678X|5.0|Easy method to follow, hair becomes hydrated and has body, suits all hair types that are curly or kinky curly. Great investment
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Not for children...wasn't expecting such a dark and violent movie, but I really liked it!  Recommended to anyone who likes violence and action;-)
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time.  The character development was wonderful and I felt like I was in these characters heads.  Very thoughtfully written, and dealt with some very complex and emotional subject matter.  Read it!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Love the game it's fun and the graphics are great. Play this game for hours. The graphics are almost like being there on the hunt.
B0028ER4QE|5.0|This is a classic album.  Recorded when vinyl was the format and it really shows through on this fantastic 180g edition. Can't say enough good things about the sound.  Just as quiet as a CD (assuming you're needle and turntable are in good order), but the sound is so much fuller it's really striking even to my relatively philistine ears.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am such a fan of this website and I am excited to have it at my fingertips.  Sometimes I suffer from information overload!
B0053O89JM|5.0|This last season volume completes the collection. Bummer that the show was taken off the air - I am sure the writers could have come up with a lot more medical mystery stories which might have intrigued the best diagnosticians.
B004NQO61Q|3.0|This is a good mouse for those struggling with carpal tunnel syndrome.  I bought this for wife and it is acceptable but the buttons are a little awkward and overly sensitive.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great Application, highly recommended, nice game, with the best graphics and great history, good play controls and nice sound, cool
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Blu-ray picture quality was excellent. I liked the story. Lots of action, multiple bad guys. Very entertaining movie. I am a big Star Trek fan and this is one of the best movies in the series.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great Application, highly recommended, nice performance and highly recommended, allow download all content from youtube directly to the device without problem
B000NY12LO|5.0|I'm a sucker for her novels. This one focuses on a high school shooting and all the ramifications from this event
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Escellent Great Application, allow read, open , review documents recived or created in a pdf format, highly recomended, nice app
B004LROUNG|4.0|Very amusing recounting of a thoroughly implausible yarn, with just enough legal veracity to remind you of Grisham's background and enough evidence of drug companies' unscrupulous rapaciousness to satisfy any need for a moral high dudgeon.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Now this is the King novel you have to get if you are a fan of the Shining.  A different direction, but tells a great story.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Several weeks later and I'm still playing and enjoying it.  I am surprised how long it's lasted, I only imagined it would be a few days worth of amusement but it turned out to be much better than I imagined.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|It's a world with people with superpower. And the powers use the goodnes and mental sanity of the people has power sourde, so every Epic is mad.<br />Who could save mankind?, only regular people
B00CXVX1OQ|3.0|Good graphics, sound, everything is nice but there's no real challenge.  Once you figure out how to beat one guy you've just beaten the next 100.  The achievements are nice enough but overall there's not much to get you coming back to this game.
B0007TKNII|5.0|This movie is amazing. It's an enchanting story. The actors are great. The singing is perfect. It is altogether a good movie.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|It really showed what Woodstock was like and you will remember it for ever since it was my generation the Boomers.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read I'm a RV person. He really described us right. But now I know who real and who's not.LOL
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have enjoyed the series and this movie didnt let me down. Full of action packed sci-fi which I like. If you have the previous movies then this is a must for the collection. Check it out as I am sure you will enjoy it.
B00A6CCF0K|2.0|I expected this to be a continuation of the Shining with an older Danny.  Instead, you have a group of people sucking &#34;mist&#34; out of others in order to stay alive?  It was implied that this is what was done in the Stanley Hotel.....not at all!  The Shining played more of a mind game on readers where the readers use their imagination whereas Doctor Sleep doesn't allow you to do that.  It described the actual act of being immortal by sucking &#34;mist&#34; and as for Rose the Hat?  One big horned tooth and her lower jaw unhinges?  There was nothing like that in the Shining.  As for the ending, I found that to be to quick and to easy for the &#34;good guys&#34; to prevail.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Stevie Wonder is a Musical Genius.  These are all great songs.  This should be included with some of the great symphonies of all time...
B004UAKAE2|5.0|They really do not make shows like this anymore.  These days perfect plastic actors and actresses, big expensive sets, etc. dominate our media.  Yet there are very few programs that have a soul.  If you like Downton Abbey and have some patience/tolerance for an older show that is a little dated in terms of its look, then I cannot recommend this show more highly.  It is really a wonderful gem of a program.  I end up watching it again every few years and probably always will.  I am honestly sad it took me so long to come to it (I first watched it in 2008).
B00D2ZF3GQ|3.0|I think this move was good. I was thinking it would be so bad because I heard it did not do very well at the box office. ok so what I have seen 100 movies that don't live up to this movie and they win a best picture. so for a movie lover like me I give it 3 stars.  give it a look it is well worth the power to run the t.v
B004W1GD4A|1.0|There is a reason this series was cancelled.  It is pretty, but it lacks any soul.  Just in the first episode there are so many off putting things I can't begin to list them.  The main thing is a very Hollywoodized cast and script.  They can mess the hair up of the cast, but they are all perfect looking cookie cutter Hollywood/modern stage actors.  There is a Sikh who tends a monkey, the story is more about fascism than about class, the plotlines often do not make much sense.  It is about pretty people and pretty, bright, flashy (presumably expensive) sets.  There is also nearly no continuity with the original series other than a very aged Rose (who was enjoyable to see), far older than she should have been given the original series supposedly ended in 1930.  So you start out from a place that makes no sense what so ever and it really just goes down hill from there.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the original series and have no intention of ever watching it, and enjoy mediocre American drama, then this is worth a watch.  If you are a big fan of Downton and/or the original series (or think you want to try the original series) I would highly recommend you skip this.  Go watch the original series if you haven't.  Fight through the black and white episodes and the cheaper sets (typical for a 1970s series) early on and you will get pulled in by the wonderful character of the series and the rather good writing.<br /><br />Very sad that this series was such a dramatic departure from the original, I had high hopes which were immediately dashed.
B00FEHXCIG|2.0|The story was not as good as the first two. I was expecting the real Mandarin story line. Not impressed.
B005C9YZIM|5.0|Bought this for my teen son & knew we would all love watching this together! What an awesome set! Thanks!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad that I can finally play Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire! Love playing this game.<br />Happy Candy Crush Saga player
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This collection is such a pleasure to read, and not just for adults but for the young adults as well.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|It Was A Really Good Book And I Enjoyed Reading All The Way Through It And Cant Wait Tew Read The Next!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Once I got past the first chapter, I couldn't put it down.<br />Great book for women, I don't think my husband would of looked it. Haha.
6305428042|5.0|This is one of my favorite childhood memories and now I have it to watch over and over again.<br />It didn't take long to arrive and was in perfect condition! Thanks!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am so glad I found this version. Every morning, it is refreshing to read God's word right off of my tablet. What a blessing.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun logic game. It is challenging,but the games are short enough to be able to play for a short amount of time.  Works well on Kindle Fire.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This is a very interesting and fun book. It talks about poo it the life and it has changed for a young teenage boy.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|A nice story about a guy and a girl that decide to record an album.  The recording turns out great, but the couple never do.  I might watch it again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think this book is amazing because it is suspenseful, sad, and happy. It truly was an excellent opportunity to read this great book. The ending was truly amazing and it finished the book with a perfectly said sentence.<br /><br />My favorite precept is: Everyone in the world should get a standing ovation at least once in their lives because we all overcomth the world.
B004A7QOUE|1.0|It was sooooo boring. I was looking for something a little more motivating. I guess this just wasn't for me.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is awesome, building  your own city is a lot of fun, and it helps pass the time. This game is worth the download
B000FC0SIM|5.0|Very entertaining stories that reveal the person behind the books and the origins of some of his best stores.  Good insights on writers and writing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Superbly written and enchanting story.  I have recommended this book to several people and gotten the same response from them.
B00992CF6W|5.0|PLZ MAKE MINECRAFT FREE or atleast a demo version of it and it is awesome that there is minecraft for kindle fire but make a demo version
B00FEHXCIG|4.0|this was another one that is incredible enjoyable. As usual, RD, Jr. throws himself completely into the role from the incessant banter and jokes to the non-stop action.
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|So I bought a new HL6180DW Brother printer.  I wanted to expand the memory so I could send good sized print jobs to the printer without having to break the jobs up into smaller jobs.  After a little research, I found this memory chip.  The price was remarkably low, and the item arrived from Komputerbay, the seller, remarkably fast, just a few days.<br /><br />The product itself and service from Komputerbay are outstanding, however....<br /><br />It was a little difficult for me to figure out how to install the product.  That was really more a function of me having never installed memory on anything before, and also, limited instruction in my printer manual about how to install it.  I was not able to just slip it right in and plow on, i had to fenaggle (is that really a word?) it some, but am now very happy with the purchase.<br /><br />Thanks Komputerbay, Amazon, and Kingston  :o)
B00AYB12PC|3.0|I must admit the beginning with Drew Barrymore made me laugh a few times.  The old stove-top jiffy pop popcorn started the chuckle. Overall, a fun and sufficiently mildly scary movie that sometimes makes fun of itself.
B008Y212PI|3.0|The puzzles did not really look like the actual item that was in the picture but it was pretty fun. Would have like different sized puzzles not just 5x5 or 10x10'<br /><br />I purchased it when it was free. I don't think I would pay for it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was great to follow up with characters from many, many years ago.  This is a great book, very entertaining and highly recommended if you enjoy this genre of writing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I had a blast solving the puzzles, the graphics were superb, the ambiance eerie and enticing. Can't wait for the sequel to come out.
B001BANK32|5.0|I am a Stephen King Fan.  When I saw Dr. Sleep come out I realized I had never read THe Shining!  I had seen the movie many years ago.  The book is excellent and of course way better than the movie.  It was great to read The Shining then move on to Dr. Sleep.
B00FLDG5BE|5.0|We have the dvd's from the prior Crossroads Guitar Festivals. Crossroads is Eric Clapton's fund raiser for the substance abuse recovery facility he established in Antigua to help others recover from chemical addiction as he did. The concept is simple -- Eric invites a large group of guitarists from virtually every style of music. The musicians come and play in a concert that, this year, ran from 7 to approximately 11, Friday & Saturday evenings at Madison Square Garden in New York City. We were only able to get tickets for Saturday's concert and were anxious for the Blu-ray/dvd to sample the Friday night concert. For anyone who likes guitar played by the very best artists, Crossroads provides a unique opportunity to hear icons play live. The concert was expensive, our tickets were $400 each for the evening, but the chance to hear all the artists in one evening in 4-1/2 of continuous performance made the price a true value. The concert happens approximately every three years and based on our experience, if there is another Crossroads, we want to attend both nights.<br />The Blu-ray will not provide every minute of both nights. I wish it would. But we did attend the one night movie theater performance and found that the editors caught the very best performances from Saturday night. I'm sure the same was true from Friday. While the Blu-ray can't be as good as being there, it is the next best thing. Check out the list of performers. We have found that Crossroads has opened our appreciation of music and artists from styles of music that we had previously ignored. As a music lover, I can say that this should be on your shelf -- in fact, you really ought to buy the Blu-rays/dvd's from the prior concerts to have a complete collection. I pre-ordered this as soon as it became available and can't wait to receive it.<br />Don't miss this. Plus, proceeds from this help support Crossroads in the fight against chemical addiction.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Excellent series, strong acting, great ensemble cast, beautiful filming, and setting. Worth watching, and coming back to again and again.
1451608659|5.0|I got this for my granddaughters who were both into gymnastics at the time.  They loved it.  The older one finished it in one or two reading sessions.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I didn't care for it. I think it jumps around a little too much.<br />I especially didn't like the ending.
1556438850|3.0|Likely meant for people already familiar with yoga it has great detail on the what to do, but I always want lots of pictures for subjects like this.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is available at last for my kindle! I am a tad addicted to this game.  Now my kindle is complete.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|Considering the amount of stars in this cast, I figured the movie would be better. Sorry to say that the cast didn't offer the chemistry I hoped for.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Inspiring. Loved reading this. Brill brill brill. Made me enjoy running again. Gives ya a little hope. Tough read. Bit do it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Loved the book.  Really enjoy the Stephen King style.  I hope he will keep writing the books we appreciate so much.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great game! Very addictive! It's very realistic. Animals, sounds, nature. Great designer's job. Love all holidays additions. Great. Love it. Thank you.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark does it again!  She wrote another book I couldn't put down till the end! I can't wait for the next one!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting forever for it to be on Amazon and it finally comes out of nowhere this week. This is my all time favorite game I would recommend this game to everybody in the world.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Great story, somewhat simplistic for Sanderson (but it's YA, so it's understandable). Still, an intersting world theme and it's fantastic.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|Enjoyable but not up to Sanderson's other books. Expected better from the author.<br />Hope for improvement in the next books.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|good game great graphics supper fun love to play when in a place I don't want to be recommend it to all my friends thanks team lava
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think candy crush is awesome I would play it all day if I did not run out of lives
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Hard to watch just one episode at a time. Have recommended it to friends and they agree, it is a good show to watch.
B005XUC398|4.0|Margin Call was an interesting and insightful film that provides an opportunity to think about Wall Street.  Not sure that it accurately depicts the trading process, etc. but it does provide great food for thought.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|The movie was well executed.  However, I felt that the society depicted put too much power in the hands of one man. The power over life and death should not be so casually handed out even in fiction.  The break down in a society that would cause this to be sanctioned is truly scary.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was engaged through the majority of the book, but the ending is a letdown. It seems as though the author just gave up and wanted to end it.
B00FAXLCWW|1.0|This could be the new wave of lackluster performances that is more sugary polish for the masses than for what the 80s music scene really is known for.<br /><br />Haim's attempt to sound 80s is far from the truth but a quick listen will have one thinking they are listening to new unreleased material from Wilson Philips. Sorry Wilson Philips for the bad comparison.<br /><br />If you are craving true 80s, go to the source and find 80s music by talented 80s musicians. If you are craving the new wave of mediocrity masking as a retro-easter-egg, then please please buy 10,000 copies of this as this band's attempt seriously lacks in substance but sugary enough for the tastes of the masses that enjoy mind-numbing tracks like &#34;What the fox says....&#34; and &#34;MMMMBop&#34;
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was very good from the start.  The story of the Orphan Train was really beyond belief and what happens to the children on board the train is very sad.  The story is so well written and the main characters keep you rooting for them, i loved the end but wanted more.  it is the kind of book that is hard to put down.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you for finally putting Candy Crush on Kindle Fire HD. I love this addictive game. I will be playing it every day. Please consider giving us Puppy Rescue Saga also and we will be set. Thank you!
B00EALI6IS|5.0|I am far from tennis and never was interested in it. This title was mentioned in some news service, and the story interested me. I read it all at once. I have read about the low glycemic index diet before and tried it. However, I never thought that the reach in fiber wheat musli and macaroni (low glycemic index food) may have another component, that some scientists believe may have bad effect on our health - the gluten. Now I understand the note on some products, that intrigued me before &#34;Gluten-free&#34;. I tried to eliminate the gluten from my diet. It works - be it auto-suggestion or confirmation of the conclusions of those, who claim that gluten has bad effect on our health, not only for those, who suffer from celiac decease. The diet also adds self-discipline, that helps to control the daily movement. I also use the Jawbone Up and think, that its Up application for iPhone, where I put into the food eaten and see its protein/carbs/fat/fiber approximated content, is also very helpful.
B000GWE44U|5.0|The Shining is a wonderful story about Danny Torrance, a lovable little boy, and his family who are trapped in a haunted hotel for the winter. They soon discover that the combination of Danny's (previously hidden) psychic abilities and an ancient curse set on the hotel summons forth the ghosts of its former guests. The Torrance family quickly finds themselves face-to-face with a motley crew of hilarious and mischievous ghosts. But with the big help of Lloyd, the hotel's former barkeep, Danny's Father Jack may just figure out a way to control the chaos and become a hero in his son's eyes. Can Jack restore order to the hotel before all the ghosts destroy it?
1476734941|4.0|It is a good concept and not difficult to follow once you have a mind set.  My body feels better not processing food constantly. The book explains the hows and whys to the 5/2 concept.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was a well written book.  The Orphan Trains are a part of our history that I knew very little about.  This gave me an insight into that time as well as a good read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|not thru with it yet, can hardly put it down.  Gripping, suspensful, terrifying.  All that I  expect from Stephen King.....
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|Korn has evolved over the years and this Album really ties all of their different styles and sounds together into one fantastic album.
0812982622|1.0|This book was selected by my monthly book group. Pulitzer or not, I found it to be impossible to get interested in, full  of lengthy descriptions of terrible torture and silly comic scenarios. I would not recommend this book under any conditions.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|You must give these pages a turn, such a treasure within. You will not be disappointed. Of this I am certain.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was easy to install.  Works great on Netflix.  I haven't tried it on other applications yet but I expect the same performance
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Another home run!! A gripping, fast read. I couldn't put it down, Amazing story of self forgiveness and inner strength. I loved it.
B00D1VKZ3M|1.0|I really could have done without this installment. A lot of moaning about the unfair imbalance between men and women when it comes to aging. We get it Helen, you are old and single and the men your age want 22 year olds. My mum is Bridget's age and she isn't stumbling through life covered in vomit and food. I've never had much of a benchmark for people who wait to have children later in life - this glimpse has done little more than make me start looking for a sperm donor : STAT. Thanks for that.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I was hard to put my Kindle down with this story.  I really liked the characters!  I can't wait to get started on book 2 and 3.
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|I enjoyed it tremendously, and what fills me with expectation is the fact that the author laid the grounds for  the next novel, as it is quite clear that we will need to hear about some of the characters who showed in the story, but disappeared towards the end. They will certainly reemerge in Hosseini's next novel.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie is so real and at times very sad.  I did not want it to end.  Great acting and writing.  If you get a chance, please go see it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book started off wide open.  I was impressed with the storyline and how it captured my attention and held it.  However, I was sorely disappointed with the ending.  The author kept the suspense and the anticipation at full throttle and at the ending of the book I almost felt like I'd been used!  What a let down.  That being said, Gillian Flynn is a fine author but in my opinion needed some help with the ending of the novel.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|My grandson looooves this. He plays with it every chance he gets. It came quickly and was everything I had hoped it would be.
0823095223|5.0|Very informative and entertaining. A well-thought-out collection of concepts and ideas. All sculptors and avid enthusiasts should have this book in their library.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|I recieved this with the Minecraft set &#34;The Nether&#34; and it was perfect.  It has been a favorite gift for my grandson and he loves having both sets.
B0000CBHOI|5.0|This was one of the best music /history documentaries that I have ever seen. I was first introduced to this fascinating piece of work when watching KQED public television sometime in the early 2000's. I watched the entire series for the whole week. I was spell bound. I taped as much I could from my VCR. For years and years I played the tapes over and over again. But, you know how it is, once you start watching movies and things on DVD'S,  the VCR tapes become a thing of the past. I kept checking The KQED network<br />trying to entertain buying the series, but it was way out of my budget .So, I went to my old faithful &#34;Amazon&#34; website and was able to purchase the entire DVD set (used) for an incredible price. I have never recreated it. I would recommend you check it out for yourself. I assure you it is more that just history about Blues or Blues player in America. It for me , was a true testament to good in the human spirit. When sometimes there are those that step outside of themselves ,and dare to tell the truth ,no matter how painful it might be. I commend  Martin Scorsese and all those who participated in this project and saw it through until  the end . Good Job<br /><br />  KayGee27
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer is a legendary band, my personal favourite out of the Big 4 of metal! This album is very good, songs like Angel Of Death and Raining Blood are extremely good. If you enjoy the classics, speed and thrash metal or anything along those lines then you need this in your collection.<br />The shipping was very good and I was impressed by how quick it got here (from America to New Zealand).<br />As a bonus, this album is the deluxe version so has two extra tracks!
B003VANOFY|5.0|the clarity I receive from the g930 is astounding! I have never had a product amaze me more. Thank you for the opertuneity to hear it for my self.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Now though there are glitches during updates its OKAY! This app is amazingly fun, I don't know what I would do without MINECRAFT!
B00433SVP6|5.0|Jason has amnesia and is a very good story with it as well as characters.THIS BOOK IS SO AWESOME,READ IT.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|fun game but not quite a match 3 like so many reviewers are saying. its a chain match game- this is not like the jewel games. still fun tho.<br /><br />4 stars because I would never pay that much for a game- FAOTD. kindle fire. no problems.
0345803485|5.0|Just a terrific product, I am very pleased. I recommend to all.<br />With pleasure would buy more.<br />Very high quality.
B008EL25LE|2.0|if you get seasick, skip this game. the screen is constantly doing that bobbing motion. it gave me a headache. I didn't even get to any of the bugs that other uses are complaining of. I can't take anymore. I have azkend 1 and liked it from the FAOTD. kindle fire 1.
B00D2DI342|5.0|Don't care for the radio edit version, but the remix and the regular versions are great.  This is a great single for a DJ, or in my case just for throwing on the turntable every once in a while.  I mainly bought it for the investment of great records down the road.  Vinyl sounds better, and the pressing and mastering done on this one are very good.  Get it if you like it.
B000002L68|4.0|The 80's inspire huge almost knee jerk responses from people. Love it? Despair at why today's music and culture can't measure up. Hate it? Feel like you got part of your life stolen by a mass marketed fraud. So when you look at The Purple Rain soundtrack you are looking at the quintessential 80's litmus test. The music, whether you like it or not, has been involved in your life. That weird high school party. Late night drives to anywhere but your parents house. Maybe an awesome night club experience. Maybe a wonderful date. Maybe just simply listening to it on record, cassette or C(probably all three. You could be fancy). This soundtrack was to the 80's what Saturday Night Fever was to the 70's. It became something bigger than it was in ways transcendent art is. The super 80's synth with the blistering guitar lead? Check. Over the top fashion sense? Check. Sexually suggestive lyrics that seem tame by todays standards? Check. Emotive singing and epic chorus that ring throughout every suburb, city and rural town? Check. This album, quite simply is iconic. The songs defined the 80's and it was only 4 years into the decade. When Doves Cry changed what was thought possible about a contemporary r&b song. (There is no bass in the song. No really. ZERO BASS. Say what?) Prince was at a rarefied place that few musicians get to. Important, popular and influential. Artists can be one, heck even two, but rarely all three. He was all three. Its still an album that influences todays musicians. Rock,pop,rap and r & b alike. Prince was provocative but not inaccessible. He understood how to examine his own demons while seamlessly blending in grooves that made everyone get on the floor. Its the total picture. Prince is all that on this album:Dance maestro, sexual provocateur, poet, seeker, finder and entertainer. Enjoy the journey. Because you can always see the sun. Day or night.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|The acting is superb!  There are a few historical inaccuracies but once the history nut in me moved past that, it is absolutely fantastic!  I am currently watching season 2 and eventhough we all know how the story ends, I can't wait to complete the series!
B00AYPXG5W|4.0|If you believe in his kind of stuff, then you will enjoy this movie. This is very interesting being it's based on a true story.<br /><br />View tips and guidelines   2 more words required.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Can't wait until season 4 comes out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Great program! We watched all of season 3 in two days.I love having no commercials.
0062255657|3.0|A well done tale ,and a page turner,but more of a short story.As a Gaiman fan it is more of a snack than a meal.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Haven't read many novels that had me fully engrossed lately. This one did.  It may be fiction, but it is loaded with facts that we would all do better to understand.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|I love north and south! Make sure that you take the time, cook some popcorn and enjoy. A true classic and romance.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|This whole album is smokin... This band is great live and there albums are starting to startup... Add this band to your collection.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|This movie has it all-- suspense, relationships, humor, special effects, great acting, and more action than you can shake a tribble at!<br />These actors have moved into these iconic characters with such ease that the viewer can clearly see reflections of the originals. The story is tight and well written and holds its momentum throughout. Trekkies will enjoy this new Trek reality, while other viewers will be thrilled with a great adventure!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and like many others, I didn't want to see it end. I was doubtful about the format (all letters from one character to another) but it worked beautifully.  I was also doubtful about the setting (post WWII England) thinking it would be dreary and sad. It was anything but and I enjoyed every page of this wonderful book.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I thought the acting was very good and the stories were scary as I like them. This is not a childrens series and should be R rated.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I didn't want to put it down, this games totally fun and really makes you think. I would recommend to anyone.
B008F9T76Q|5.0|This trilogy is AMAZING!!! Really makes you think! A definite read! You are rooting for these characters every step of the way.
B00ELCZSS2|3.0|The popular songs are good, but the rest of the album is somewhat drab.  A lot of the songs sound the same.
0385742886|5.0|I think this book is the best of the series. This book answers any questions you may have had. And it also gives a great description of how the world looks for the time during 'The Maze Runner Trilogy'. If you have read the trilogy, you'd be silly not to read this.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is great! As some others have said in their reviews, if you just play till you run out of energy then wait, you do not have to spend any cash! The game gives players different choices to play. I love it.
0099529939|5.0|We all know Sherlock Homes is a classic, so I won't be reviewing the content. I got this book for the cover.<br />The cover is cloth hard back with an olive green color and gold lettering. The front and the spine have a magnifying glass. The back has a large finger print. The band-like black dust-cover is removable. The inside of the cover is a flat navy blue with a gold-colored (non-metallic) border.<br />The edges of the pages are not gilded.<br />There are no illustrations in this book except for those that are part of the story (like the Dancing Men, etc).<br />Overall, I am very pleased with this book. I wanted a beautiful cover to match a timeless work of literature. I like the simple green and gold design over the more opulent (almost messy) design of Barns&Noble's leather bound edition. If you are one of those book collectors who loves beautiful books, this is a good choice if you want a more vintage look. If you like leather and gold-gilded edges, I would recommend the B&N edition.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I waited so long for this to come back to the Kindle fire.<br />I love this game on kindle fire!
160459201X|5.0|The book had very little errors, but I think it is due to how it was printed, but besides that it was truly an eye opening experience. I just finished the whole book (read 2-3 chapters daily) and even practice the tips. It's been about 2 weeks and I already feel different. I feel more alert, positive and creative. I even purchased other books following the same subject because I want to help others once I get my life coach certificate. I will even consider in loaning them out because I find them helpful. If you are looking for something positive and fulfilling then get this book you will not be disappointed .
B009D5VNLS|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, she's only 2 and this keeps her fully entertained! I love the morals this story tells
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great way to spend a lot of time to figure out various types of clues to solve puzzles.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|keeps you thinking. fun game great puzzles. I like how it is not predictable and all of the puzzles are different
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There were so many twists and turns and it did so well following up with The Shinning. It flowed so well and I couldn't put it down. I love it!!!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I'm on Episode 14 and just think it's the BEST, trying to budget more time in my schedule to watch it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have slowly pulled away from reading Stephen King's novels.  It seemed that after his accident, his writing became angry and it was hard for me to be pulled into the stories.  I used to wait for a book to come out and be first in line.  Digital books have changed that.  Still love the feel of a book.  My concept of a good story is that when you put your bookmark in and go to do something you are drawn back because you are afraid that the characters will do something while you are gone...<br />Dr Sleep was like that, as was JoyLand.  Welcome back Stephen King, I have missed you.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I never read the Harry Potter series, so didn't know what to expect. It took me half the book to get involved and finally remember who was who and what was going on. But after that I was hooked. I also enjoyed picking up on the British jargon.  Sometimes I was anxious to get through the descriptive parts and get back to figure out the plot, but I realize now that I actually had a picture of the town and the people in my head.
B0001I561E|5.0|Bought this for our grandchildren...but decided that SOME of the content was not appropriate for under 7 years old...so we will keep it until they are a bit older.............JaFar is too spookey!!!  Our grandkids would have nightmares!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|FINALLY!!! I've been waiting for this game for the KINDLE forever!!! Now my life is a little easier!!! Yahoooooooooo!!! Now I don't have to use my phone all the time!!
0618918248|5.0|As I was reading this book, I kept thinking &#34;it's as if he read my mind'. It makes so much sense & should be a must read for anyone who loves logic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is awesome. My friends and I play it all the time. I love all the updates. I recommend you get this app It is totally worth 6.99.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Bought it because I thought I can look at stuff on my iPad and for presentation at work on our large screen monitor.  This unit is NOT useful for iPad.  The only thing you can use it for is to display youTube and Netflix, both available though a blu-ray player or smart TV, and not very useful at work.  So it's pretty much useless for iPad.<br />For those who dosen't know how it works, I believe it rebroadcasts certain sites (currently 2 sites) from Google.<br />This is an emerging technology so it will probably get better in time. But for now, it's a waste of money for iPad users.<br />If you keep the unit plugged up all the time, it gets really hot.<br />Apple needs to develop a bluetooth or wireless HDMI interface for iPad.  Would be really useful for me.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hated it it was just horrible .a not enough words .b gay racism .c really racist and just rude.
B009GEON22|5.0|This is the story that created modern comic books, as well as the way we view the heroes contained in their pages.  The story is broken up into 2 movies but adapted pretty faithfully.  An aging Bruce Wayne must once again become The Dark Knight to clean up Gotham.  Without going into the details I'll say that TDKR Parts 1 and 2 are a must see for any DC fan.  The story is dark and brooding(read not for young children) with some takes on familiar characters that we had never seen before.  Before seeing the sequel to Man of Steel watch these movies.
B00AJF87QU|4.0|Let me admit upfront that I am a fan from the early days of Stereophonics, starting with the 1997 debut album \\"Word Gets Around\\". That was followed by the band's masterpiece, 1999's \\"Performance and Cocktails\\", and then in 2001 the equally enticing \\"Just Enough Education to Perform\\" (the so-called JEEP album). When the 4th album came out in 2003, \\"You Gotta Go There To Come Back\\", it seemed like singer-songwriter Kelly Jones had taken a chill pill, as the energy (and rock) level dropped dramatically. After one more fairly good album, 2005's \\"Language. Sex. Violence. Other?\\", I lost track of these guys altogether. Because I knew I would be seeing them in concert again (more on that later), I decided to check out this, the band's 8th studio album.<br /><br />\\"Graffiti On The Train\\" (10 tracks; 43 min.) starts off with a somewhat tentative \\"We Share The Same Sun\\", which can't decide whether it's rocking hard or slowing down. It is followed by the title track (3rd UK single), which finds Jones in a pensive mood. \\"Indian Summer\\" (2nd UK single) is a pleasant mid-tempo tune. \\"Catacomb\\" is a hard-charging song, the kind of which reminds me of the early days of the band. It is followed by an equally great \\"Roll the Dice\\". Late into the album, we get \\"In A Moment\\" (1st UK single), which is actually an intriguing tune but about as far left from mainstream commercial radio as you can get for Stereophonics (as a result, it is the only Stereophonics UK single not to chart in the band's 16+ year history). The album closes with \\"No-One's Perfect\\", yet another pensive tune. This album is not bad, of course (I mean, it is Stereophonics after all), but this band has in my opinion been so much better. If you are new to Stereophonics, I would encourage you to check out \\"Performance and Cocktails\\", a near-perfect album that now plays like a greatest hits album on its own.<br /><br />This past weekend I saw Stereophonics live at the Corona Capital music festival in Mexico City (it's the Mexican equivalent of Coachella). It was my first time seeing them again in concert in close to 10 years. Much to my surprise and delight, Kelly Jones & Co, put on a high energy 50 min. set. They played 5 songs from the new album (all 3 singles, plus Catacomb, and Violins and Tambourines) and every  one of them simply sounded miles better in concert than what you hear on this album. The rest of the set was rounded out with nuggets from the past, including \\"Mr. Writer\\", \\"Dakota\\" and, best yet, \\"The Bartender and The Thief\\". What a terrific show that was. If you have a chance to see them live, do not miss them!Mexican equivalent of Coachella). It was my first time seeing them again in concert in close to 10 years.

B00B7FYJ9U|5.0|The Dark Knight Returns is brought to life masterfully in both Part 1 and Part 2, however Part 2 is  by far my favorite.  The amazing scenes between Batman and the Joker as well as the climactic battle are both amazingly done.  I won't get into anything too specific but if you're a DC fan this is a must watch.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Wow! Wow! Wow!<br />These guys are the real deal. Loved this CD and I could listen to it looping all day.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|beautiful story - the character development wasn't as strong as in the shining, but a great story and well worth reading
B00338QENI|5.0|Having never heard of Henrietta Lacks, I was suprized that she is not more widely known.  What a magnificent life after her death given to so many of us.
B001BANK32|5.0|a great scare and creepfest of course, but the character development is Stephen King's greatest talent in my opinion. His other books with incredible character development in my opinion are The Stand, The Talisman, 11/22/63.
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|Great!!  It doesn't get any better than this.  Old West drama and scenery in a very interesting film.  It is very similar to Rio Bravo.  A defnite plus!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|The premise behind this book is amazing. In a world filled with superhero movies sometimes we forget what it would be like to be a regular citizen caught up in the madness. Brandon did a great job of portraying David, a regular human caught in a war of Supers. It would take a strong person to be able to stand up and not just give up. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and look forward to Firefight in 2014. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was the predictability of a couple of the plot points. A solid 4.90 star book. Thank you Mr. Sanderson for another great series!
B00EUS9JF0|3.0|The best are very good. Too many filler songs. That's really it. Nothing more or less. At this stage of his life/career, not bad at all. He's done a lot worse (Pipes of Peace, Press To Play, Wild Life) and many better (Band on the Run, Venus and Mars, Tug of War, Chaos and Creation). I can skip over the ones in this CD I don't like.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|sweetest game tons of goodies no calories just hours of endless addictive good old fashioned fun!! once you start its so hard to stop.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|What many books now lack is humor, fun and just plain wit in their adventures.  This is a book that I keep returning to because it simply does not get old.  Children have their fantasies, this is one for adults that still have the sense of fun of a child.
8866131121|5.0|Product works perfectly, cant beat if for the price, cheaper than any other spot looked at! Highly satisfied! Great Service!
B008AIGWVA|4.0|I just know our grandsons will love this.  I will go right to this the next time they ask to play with my phone.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Suits is an awesome series. I love watching it. Harvey keeps surprising with his thinking and wins over the fans and the cases. I would totally recommend it to anyone.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book answers everything about what happened to little Danny Torrance from its well known predecessor \\"The Shining\\", and I assure you, you won't put it down. A fantastic new character who also has the Shining is introduced, 12 year old Abra, who you will soon fall in love with and be rooting for her too. Watch the friendship between her and Dan unfold and see the kind of trouble the Shining can get a person into when they aren't focused on trying to hide it their whole lives as Dan did. An absolute must read, in my opinion, just like the book before it. So good.
B00FIYGYKS|4.0|I love how these guys just keep reinventing their style, this album is quite a groove inducer...<br />on another note; listening to the lyrics I've noticed Heafy is PISSED!!! Good on you sir, speak out against the stupidity in this world.
B006DJ2JSI|3.0|I must be doing something wrong. I have to page through every page to find the word I am looking for.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|The Chromecast is great for what it can do but the only reason I bought it was to use it for when I travel. I figured that I could simply plug it in and run it off the hotel's wifi..., but you can't. I'm hoping this is something that Google adds to the Chromecast but for right now there is no way for you to authenticate the Chromecast once it gets connected to the hotel's wifi, generally you would see a log-on screen or something like that, my Paperwhite Kindle for example has this capability.<br /><br />Chromecast doesn't have that option and until it does there isn't much reason to purchase this if you are planning on using it for travel.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|what else is there to say? I can open PDFs now, and can sometimes even find free books to download in PDF form
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I normally don't pay for music, I just download the flac files. But for Lindsey Stirling I'll gladly pay for her music. A lot of folks that listen to classical and orchestra might not find her music good. Basically they know what a violin should sound like, but it's not the sound but the style I love. When she was on one of those talent shows where they told her she would never by a lead performer it broke my heart, At that time you can clearly hear her mistakes but that's because she was jumping and dancing all over the place. I sure wish I could see their faces now. She showed them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed playing. I can't wait for more levels. It kept me so engrossed. Keep them coming. I would recommend it.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|A Wonderful story, and the professional narration added a vast quality to the novel like which I hadn't experienced before!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I'm a King fan from way back and he did not disappoint with Doctor Sleep. This sequel to the Shining, one of my all time favorites, was a good read. I can't wait to read what he does next!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Thank you love this game finally on kindle made my day I was hoping this would make its way to the Amazon store keep them comming
0812983459|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book from start to finish. I loved all the characters; easy to identify with any one of them.
B00FG1Q5J8|4.0|This is my favorite game on the store it has great graphics and great gameplay but after a while it feels the same when you are in battles.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I downloaded the android compatible version and it will not connect to let me register or login with existing account rendering is completely useless and a waste of my time.
B000CNE092|5.0|My 20 year old daughter watched this growing up when the movie was on VHS.  She wanted this in DVD and I found here on Amazon.  THANK YOU !!  She watched it this morning and loved it as much as she did when she was 3.  Thanks !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game great for all ages. the halloween part is really fun and creative. I love the fact that every.time you open the game its a whole different set up
B0011EU0NG|5.0|My 20 year old daughter wanted this movie because she grew up watching it on VHS (I went to see it as a kid myself).  She absolutely loved it.  Thanks !
B00FGH3TGO|5.0|Every time I hear her stuff I experience cognitive dissonance between the knowledge of how young she is and how awesome the music is. Whatever, it's great.
B002POVIMS|5.0|unique and beautiful voice.  Her voice reminds me about how I felt when I first heard Florence & the Machine- thrill to hear a voice that is powerful and not like some teenage girl. Song words are also well written. Glad I took a chance on buying the album!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Great album, can't wait to see them tonight in Brooklyn! They are gonna bring the house down!  Mookie blaylock lives on.
B00DV2D0JC|2.0|This was my first G5 HO game.  The graphics and animation are really mediocre, almost childish, compared to some of the other apps.  I would recommend it for teenagers or young adults.  Otherwise, do not waste your money.  I'm so mad for paying $5 you can't imagine.  I would never buy another G5 game!<br /><br />The game played fine on my Kindle Fire so no issues on that end.  The HO sections were good.  I actually found them challenging but then got the hang of them.  The puzzles were difficult for me.  A few of them I was able to complete...others I skipped (thankfully there was that option).  The game takes you back and forth and as you advance in the game, it's a bit tedious as they take you 6 steps forward, 6 steps back, 6 steps forward, 6 steps back....<br /><br />If you are not a sophisticated player, then go ahead and buy it.  But as I said, I found it better suited for teenagers or young adults and definitely overpriced.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|it is very funny especially the vidieo also the game is very awesome and fun and i recomend it to everyone
B0058SNIC6|5.0|I have been wearing a style of Crocs that is no longer available and was not sure how the Jayan's would compare.  I work where the floors are cement and I am just as happy with these as the old style.  The fit is perfect and I love the easy care - wash with water and a quick buff and they look like new!
B00A2H9WW8|5.0|This \\"remake\\" was ok. I really enjoyed both the 1978 & 2002 versions.<br /><br />Honestly, I was expecting more in the prom massacre scene, but oh well.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the film and it was well made.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|It's a good game with a solid foundation. Very pleased thus far.<br />Very solid single player campaign. Gonna try multiplayer soon.
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|The film was just ok.  That doesn't mean, however, that I wouldn't watch it again.  The acting was just ok but when Ms Paltrow is in a film I will watch it!
B0067RQYNW|1.0|When I first got on I had to force close. I thought it was like Microsoft. But no,  not even close.<br />I WOULD NOT BUY THIS APP
B00A6CCF0K|1.0|Worst Stephen King book-ever!  I kept trying to push through it, hoping for something to catch my interest: no luck!
B001NLL93W|3.0|I do love these books but the only reason I kept reading was to find out the lose ends , but then it became predictable .* There is a society of people with special powers and abilities but yet in the end they are no diffrent then the average mundane . :( I think the end could of had more . Bug I did like the storie it was kick butt .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app is so awesome &iexcl;!!!!!!!!! I have been waiting for this like forever!!!!!!!! I am sure u will love this app!!!!
1250038820|5.0|Full of beautiful & crazy people of NYC. Love your anecdotes, Brandon. Great size--not the coffee table big book size, just a textbook size). Good pricing. Will pick up often to browse through it.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Just a bunch of monologue and shooting. Not much content.<br />The supporting actress made it more interesting though, but the storyline was too obvious
B008AX1HD8|2.0|Harry Hole is one of the best drunken cops around. however this doesn't  compare to the later novels. disappointing to be true.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|This is the first book I have read by David Baldacci, I really liked it and will read others he has written. Anyone who likes political based murder mystery books this is a really good one to read.
B009LOJK1Q|4.0|The way Mr King connects this book with The Shining is brilliant. As usual he doesn't indulge in sentimentality, he just lets the story flow. And remember Redrum. lol.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game. the updates keep it interesting and im always excited to see what level they bring out next.
B0038YWPZS|4.0|This is for a gift and I really like the timing of getting this and also the packaging!  Great dancing
B008Y212PI|4.0|This game reminds me of Minesweeper. It's a good alternative to other games like Angry Birds or bike race, as this uses the other hemisphere of your brain. It gets a bit repetitive, but that's to be expected. Glad it was a free app of the day not too long ago. I've enjoyed it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Story picks up where it left us hanging.  Characters lives continue to unfold as their world starts to come undone.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Great Book! I loved it! I couldn't put it down! It is recommended for people who love like Harry Potter !
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is quite entertaining but it keeps freezing on my Kindle Fire HD. Nothing more to say about it.
0553381687|5.0|The minute this book came out, I snatched it right of the shelf. I have always been some what of a nerd and I always like reading books about a time where there are lords and kings, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, Magic and mystery, intriguing romance, and adventure like never seen before!!<br /><br />I overly enjoyed this book and it's fantasies. A world that is different than J.R.R. Tolkien, but also the same as J.R.R. Tolkien.<br /><br />A family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Great classic. Jim Carrey at his finest. They need more movies similar to this now a days. The CGI work was ahead of its time also.
076790592X|5.0|I believe that I have found a book that speaks out to women who are wanting change, but I believe I have found a book that will reach out to men as well. Think of it as a life coach for your new year, and his name is Mitch Albom. The book? Many of his books are life changing books; they make you think, they make you wonder about your own life. This book puts them all together nicely for you to read. It is called “Tuesdays with Morrie: An Old Man, AYoung Man, and Life’s Greatest Lesson.” How is this book helpful you may ask? I believe this quote from the book will help make my point: “So many people walk around with a meaningless life. They seem half-asleep, even when they’re doing things they think are important. This is because they’re chasing the wrong things. The way you get meaning into your life is to devote yourself to loving others, devote yourself to your community around you and devote yourself to creating something that gives you purpose and meaning.”<br /><br />Isn’t that what we want out of life? Isn’t that what were looking for when we want “change” in our “new” life. This book will help you understand the meanings of family, emotions, money, forgiveness and many more. Mitch Albom was struggling to find his way in life and remembered who helped him start, his mentor, Morrie Schwartz. Morrie was his professor, his mentor and when Albom was down in life he knew the right person to go to for help. Do you have a mentor? That’s something to consider when your making your New Year’s resolutions.
B00E0SX118|5.0|We saw this in the theater and laughed a ton. We knew when it became available on Amazon we'd have to get it. My 4 boys love it!
0312641893|5.0|Ever read the Cinderella story? Loved it didn't you? Liked how a young woman that came from a house of horrible people, a life where all she did was work and work and not get anything from it but won't complain about it goes for one night have a &#34;ball&#34; only to find out that everything she new was a lie. But, that didn't matter to the man that fell in love with her; the man that could take all her fears and worries away. The Prince has come!<br /><br />This is not like that story.<br /><br />Cinder is a wonderful take-off of the Cinderella story but very different in so many ways. For one, it's set in the near future; there are cyborgs; she is instead mechanic rather than a housekeeper; she does find her Prince, but it's nothing like Cinderella would ever encounter! There is talk of war, things that would make a grown woman cry, but a cyborg? Naw, a cyborg would go and help in any way she could, even if it could cost her life or the lives that she loves.<br /><br />I really fell in love with this book. It kind of took me a while to get into it, but after a few chapters, I just fell in love with it. But by the end of the book, I was furious! I have to wait a full year to actually finish the story, for it contiues. Darn it!! Come on Meyer, finish the book already! You've got some hungry readers waiting to see what happens next.

B009ZZDNT6|1.0|When I originally downloaded this app, it worked perfectly.  it's been through several upgrades since then and each has made it worse.  Now, the alarm only goes off sometimes.  On the mornings it fails I always  check to make sure it wasn't set incorrectly, it will freeze my gen 1 fire every time so I must reboot.  I've uninstalled and reinstalled hoping to fix the problem.  If I must keep my cell phone alarm set as a back-up because this app is so unreliable then it's not worth it....DELETED!

B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I have enjoyed this author too much. Each book that he has written has the idea that prophecy has gone wrong. This book does not disappoint with this concept. Also the idea of a bunch of super humans that are corrupted by their powers. In addition to that, the idea of a bad super man like character was entertaining.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I bought this book in both hardcover and on my kindle so I could read it at home and on the go.  Loved it.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Great story. I read some of the reviews saying it was too long, or the author spent too much time describing things. The most comical complaint being he used too much profanity. Ignore these. The story is rich and full. The characters are memorable and flawed. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. So much so that as soon as I finish this review I will be buying the next.
B007SGM084|2.0|I bought these books for my kindle and bought the entire series.  I couldn't even make it through half of the first book.  The story is what I expected it to be, but I feel that it is poorly written and aside from the &#34;steamy&#34; parts there isn't much of a story.
