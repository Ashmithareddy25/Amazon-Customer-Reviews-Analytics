B0012X0HHU|5|Great buy!
B000B6DG4U|5|Works great for protecting brake caliper parts and also for dressing them up.  Requires maticulus prep work and very clean surfaces for great overall results.
B0000AXR66|4|Fast delivery. Good deal.
B0002SR46I|5|Very good quality. Used many times with no problems. Reasonably priced. Would buy again but there is no need because this one will last.
B00547IVXM|5|Bought this to use as a call button for a relative with mobility issues.  Put the transmitter and receiver on badge reel clips to make make them wearable and it works wonderfully.
B00MEUS2J0|5|Stopped oil leaking engine
B00AOCN70O|1|Didn't fix on my 05 ninja 250. Waste of money and time.
B008FWVKBS|5|Perfect fit.
B000JFJLP6|5|This thing is awesome!! Very easy to use.
B005V1DG8G|5|GREAT
B00KZJQ2L2|5|All Good! Fits great in a 2013 Silverado. Could handle a shield a few inchs bigger as well, so don't get too hung up on dimensions. Like other reviewers, I found my truck to be several degrees cooler after sitting all day in the Carolina heat and humidity. I had no problem folding back up and storage is great. I am appreciative to another reviewer for the best way to fold the shade. Having read that prior to purchase, I didn't need to look for instructions . Prime example of you get what you pay for.
B0031AWJZK|5|Very good well built good prices
B001NKGETW|5|Excelent
B00QXM7QSS|4|you must trim it to work in your trunk,soft and easy cut on the lines.
B001C6OYWG|5|Easy to install, works good
B00HYEZU9G|4|Leds are a little dim but all in all it does what it is designed to do.
B00L7E80IW|5|Arrived on time, and fit perfectly. They are folded differently than the originals and they do&#34; hang out&#34;.
B009H1EGSU|5|Easy to install. Study and works great.
B002P8WYRC|5|Fits perfectly
B004GCCLK0|4|Arrived quick and fit well.  Had to do a little trimming on one of the tabs but otherwise it's a great product.  Certainly worth 4-stars.
B00PS69DYA|3|Plastic housing and not as sturdy as I would like, but is functional.
B000JK2D06|5|satisfied with price and delivery
B00HZTDKZG|5|Works Great at a great price
B001PNEAYS|5|Fit and work good on my 2005  Mercury Mariner v6
B00P68PSGM|1|The sprocket was too big.  Didn't work for my 2002 zuma 50cc.  Very disappointed.  I had to use the old on I had.
B00LNOK4E4|1|Bulb broke during install, cheap Chinese junk
B00BZLEYYQ|5|Perfect fit.
B0076AB3F8|5|I own a 2008 Subaru Forester. The sun shade fits super well. Keeps the heat off my dashboard. I  love it!
B001RZ2CQW|5|Works great
B003YMALY6|5|These helped give me the adequate space I needed for my wider tires. Along with tires I was puttin out a lot of horses. Close to 600hp on my half ton. These held on every mud bog and drag race I've gotten into.
B000Z0HVHA|5|this is a nice extension for multiple use is not chip is thick heavy duty cord :
B001AIZ5HY|2|after polishing the shine was gone and the lens was hazed in less than 6 months
B000IY6HZA|5|fits and works well
B003ZWJJC0|5|Awesome!
B00DULUN0S|3|Nice bag, well build but its rather small and I cannot keep all of my car care goodies in one bag.
B004940ZNK|5|Great piece, worked very well for my Chevy Malibu 2007
B000XEBI9K|4|Great protection, but I find I have to slam the trunk closed instead of the auto-close feature on my car. It sometimes takes two slams to keep the trunk closed. But, it is great for parking in NYC garages, where dings occur on a regular basis.
B00RHSMGNW|5|Very nice looking. May be a tad pricey but I can't think of too many things today that couldn't be labeled &#34;pricey!&#34;
B001TALVNA|5|Great and easy to install
B0073W8OYM|1|Bought these awhile back didn't last but a week maybe a little longer. Went with another brand.
B002T4DDTA|5|Perfect fitment. Ride quality was as good as stock or better.
B000EVYGZA|5|very good
B0002STS3U|4|Works as advertised.
B00R44BZKE|5|Worked great for the the job.
B00CAYASKG|5|LOVE these boots!<br />More of a spring & summer boot, there is an amazing amount of ventilation on these things. Very easy to get on and off the foot & stay secure during the whole ride.  Has a side zip on the instep and a velcro strap that loops thru a ring to assist security. Very comfortable to walk around in too when dismounted.<br />Had them for a year now & still look & feel great like day one!
B002UJVNFA|5|Thiese are the ones they sell for $20 each at motorcycle dealerships
B001FLZ1YI|1|Didn't fit ended up just using bolts
B001GN1GLM|5|it works
B00KMBEMZG|5|I CAN USE MY REMOTE AGAIN, THANK YOU FOR THE GREAT PRICE AND VERY FAST DELIVERY.
B00AYH6CQU|3|Holes on this product are not aligned with standard outdoor electric box. Need extra effort to mount it on electric box. For such an expensive remote control, this is really annoying. Functionality wise, it works.<br />updates: if this remote control had a timer on it, it would be perfect. Check all remote controls for inverters, it appears that none of them has this functionality. It is really disapointed since I always turn inverters off during day time and turn them back on during night time. Since there is no such an functionality, I have to do the job manually everyday.
B008QXZ5UI|5|love them in my 07 EOS 2.0 T
B000KITSMI|5|very clever tool
B000VU57YS|5|Great!!! I just need an pick for the door now!!!!!!!
B002PQW4SI|3|I am amazed at how these parts are described as &#34;fits your jeep&#34; and when you get them there is something that needs modified or altered to get them to work. In this particular case each light housing had 3 one inch alignment pins that had to be cut off. Yes, that is simple enough but when I see &#34;fits your jeep&#34; that means pull the old one off and put the new one on. Plug and play baby, plug and play.
B00311ZFQE|4|As promised. Worth the money.
B00KIQ68WU|5|Works great!
B000C2ALXM|4|No problems with gasket  It was delivered as promised.
B00KPRQJYY|5|Nice shirt ...I'm a small female ..got the small ..I can fit my gear / pads under neath it with room to spare ...so  it's good for small women too
B00JQL5RCK|5|Great product, Great Fit...  Just had to wait longer then expected to receive it, but well worth the wait
B002YL5364|2|Cheap, but faded very quickly.
B004OJZ0OO|5|Love these.  My friends keep asking where did I get.  They really bring my baby moon hubcaps.  What I especially like is they do not leak.  Nice product.
B00RW7X1QE|2|Fell apart after 3 months. Will not buy again.
B001E36KWO|5|They look Awesome! Quick install and Fast delivery. Thanks
B000BYB838|4|Good deal. Shipping was fast
B00MAIBN4W|5|We had to replace fixture in our camper.  Works great and I ordered extra bulbs.
B003Y3066S|4|They aren't quite flush-mount, but the work in our application.  We needed a way to tie down the curtains on our deck pavilion.  By attaching grommets to the corners of the curtains and linking the grommets to the D-Rings, our problem is solved.  Prompt shipping, quality product.  Using outdoors.
B00MQAG1X2|5|Works fine and looks good, but I get the sense it's a bit on the flimsy side. If you screw your plate in too tightly, the plastic &#34;grommets&#34; might crack. It could do with a little more heft. On the other hand, as I said it's handsome enough and looks good on the back of my (yes) pony car. (June 2017 update: two years and no failures, so perhaps it's not as flimsy as I thought. Raising to 5 stars!)
B004126L56|4|Most of what I would say has been covered.  I bought this for a replacement tire on my kymco people 150 and it works just fine.  The only thing I would say is I feel like the tire introduced a small amount of wobble to steering, but that might be entirely unrelated to the tire and frankly for the price this concern is very minor.
B00F8LEB9W|4|Exact replacement.  Works, had them almost a year now.
B002CN2812|5|Worked !
B000CGG3U8|1|It fell apart when I went to unplug the connector and all of the components popped out, had to have a tow truck get me. Absolutely terrible product. I don't recommend it
B00JXOHHU0|4|worked as expected...that is all one canask
B005VYOHTA|5|Perfect fit for 2009 Mercury Mariner.  Easy install with great directions.  Most of hitch is hidden from view.
B003ZWKH3U|5|Received in a reasonable amount of time from the company and I immediately put it to use this past weekend to cover/secure a bunch of tree branches and grass clippings to take to the dump.  It took very little time to secure the very uneven load and I didn’t lose anything out the back, even going down the highway at 60.  I especially like the anchor point versatility that allows for smaller, larger, or uneven loads and everything in-between.  The entire setup is very strong and is rated at 2550 lbs with four straps (on the medium net).  This is more than enough for the bed of my 3/4 ton pickup (with max payload of approx. 1600 lbs).  I am very impressed and although it may seem a little expensive, you definitely get what you pay for.<br /><br />My only gripe is that it has a peculiar plastic/oil smell that hopefully dissipates over time, but this is just “nit-picking”.
B001EOWQY4|5|Product arrived quickly and was as described.
B0049MVBMG|5|Excellent item at a great price! Easy install on my 03 Tacoma
B001GF5HMY|5|Fits great my car is cooler.
B000ETQMIQ|4|Would have gave it a 5, but doesn't hold its shape well
B00NRVAAIG|5|Only installed these a week ago, along with Kensun ballast and cancellors. Excellent visibility from my low beams, a great buy!
B002GX9CWG|5|Works very good for me better hourse power on Honda Accord
B0031GYOYI|5|Perfect fit on my 1991 Ford F250 with a 460.  Seams just as good as OEM reservoir.
B00HFVVUHY|5|Perfect shipped timely!
B007J8IKC6|5|Received my antenna unscrewed the factory antenna and used the adapter to install my new one! This does fit 2500 and 3500 Silverado models as well from 2007-13. Great product nice quality!
B00008RW9V|1|this product is a total mess.. dont buy it.. Take mine for free if you want it.. Leaves behind a lot of lint and messes up the car.
B00V5RA476|5|It didnt stick at first because I realized I forgot to clean.  On the second go things came out smoother than expected.  Heat at the end really pulled everything together and made it look clean.
B00360C4MS|5|My wife has one on her old car and had to have one for her new Camaro. She is happy so everyone is happy.
B00RGO6QGK|5|Here in Chile, there are lots of Explorers Limited (incluiding my own explorer), but now mine is unique
B00HMRDPBK|3|fit well low cost, od switch was bad :&#62;(
B00SXB3AL4|5|Luv it
B00DEYRAZ2|4|It was fast to received the products. However the model NV-2036 is NOT the 9 inches model as described. It is 6 inches ! The 9 inches model is NV-2035 ! But anyway I ordered by model nmber as per mfg website and this what I want. An other thing, I ordered two sets,  but they are little different.
B00IRBPCEI|5|Good tool in tough times
B00QK0NXH6|5|The sticker was intact and easy to put on. My tinted back window now looks sexay.
B00062YEPY|5|great product all engine builders professional or novice should own these...
B002UCYRZU|4|This product is great.  Cleared up my scratches and fog on my windshield of my bike
B000EFGWFS|3|It is a decent brush. The pole bends with even slight pressure while fully extended.
B00DGXP09O|5|high quality sticker ideal for car glass!!
B008RIEQXY|5|Great for my relocated license plate, keeps the plate lit and legal on my truck.
B00HJDJAKM|5|been looking for this a very long time
B000F6F99G|5|This is everything it is advertised to be.  Very easy setup and installation, adjusted once when I installed it and it has been perfectly accurate since then.
B00CPGQ1GO|4|Does its job as stated.  Easy to carry around.
B00HASW274|5|They fit perfectly and protects just fine. I don't see a reason to get something more expensive just for an everyday driver.
B009FREAGO|2|We don't like this trash bag because it's difficult to open from the front seat.  It's also a little too large for our needs.
B0002Q7ZHI|5|Super easy to install.  Toughest part was removing the molding on my 2000 Jeep Cherokee.  Roughly 25 minutes to install and get everything back in place.  Worked great.
B00308BTO0|3|There kind a small
B005KI6TFM|2|Took incredibly long to arrive past the date provided. They aren't very sturdy either. But if you only want one on to make your bike legal than it'll do.
B00FY849SW|5|worked great
B0000AY3X0|5|very nice
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Received excellent condition
B00JXW0S4O|4|If you take your time on this, and have the tools to do it or atleast similar tools that work, you will be impressed! *i watched videos on youtube on how to install also, big help.<br />My headlights were pretty ugly messed up from sun damaged, this was my main reason to purchase this tint.  I didn't buy it just to add color to it, this tint literally became my cars make-up because i had lost alot of motivation from the ugly look of my headlights. I hadn't realized that he headlights were like the face on a person, and my headlights for my Corvette C6 are too damn expensive to purchase right now i have a kid and one on the way, and with a wife that is not too happy to have to spend about $400 on new set of headlights for my vette, i had to look for cheaper options and this tint, this specific brand became my favorite thing i have done to my car.  I can't rate 5stars because i did not receive steps on installing or specified tools needed but i do have small very small experience and watched videos on how to, let me tell yall, i had bought some other brand they were black and were specifically pre cut for my corvette but honestly the material wasn't as smooth as this one, and besides black from that brand i had bought was too dark to see at night, this blue is perfect plus adds alittle blue to you sight.  Nice.  Im not a professional, its not super easy to install simply because it requires patience.<br /> If you feel you cant or wont,  then just take it to a pro. This right here its a very good low price, im sure your total wouldn't be too much money if you have someone else do it.
B00T7GYDTC|5|So I had a chance to buy this at a reasonable discount for an honest review and here it is. I got it in yesterday and put it on my ZTR last night, with temps heading to 108 I am definitely going to night mow with this. The construction was heavy not cheap and it lit up the whole yard, I am conflicted on taking it off to put on my UTV or tracker for the lease. Guess I will just have to buy two more, well worth the price.
B00LHJFNIC|5|Worked perfect!!
5926025516|5|very good product
B00WRUJIKO|2|Quality is 3 out of 10. It serves its purpose as an armrest. Matches the interior and doesnt look bad. Going back i would have bought a factory armrest from a junk yard. Install took 20 min with no problems. Just know u get what u pay for quality is cheap price is cheap.
B00U8695HK|5|So far so good. Would want to try for couple more days though. Pretty amazing if it works as good as now months after use. :)
B002LGXYOU|4|Installation went well. The cover is easy to roll up and put in place by one person- much easier than the previous snap down cover on my truck!<br /><br />My only critique- there was a gap of ~1/2 inch between the front edge of the cover and the top of my truck bed. If water has collected on the cover after a rainstorm, it has a tendency to drain into the bed when I back the truck up. The bed has a plastic liner installed by the dealership, as well as the Rail System installed by the dealership. I placed a piece of doorway insulation foam along the front edge of the truckbed and then re-installed the TonnoSport. This seems to help keep the water out of the bed.
B00061SLWW|5|A great tool, well packaged and fast delivery! Would buy again! A great tool for the professional or the homeowner. I am a heavy diesel mechanic by trade and use this often.
B007A3DSDQ|5|Easy to install works great !
B001ENN1QW|5|The price alone was reason enough to buy these plates, the added look was icing on the cake. These plates make our 750Li(M addition) stand out when we drive this fantastic piece of machinery. The price can't be beat no matter how hard you look, Amazon has done it once again with pricing and sellers.
B00GZZRR50|5|Very nice ashtray image is under clearcoating so itll never rub off
B000E243CA|5|second time I wrapped my pipes.. first wrap lasted 5 yrs before I gouged it. I ll  never own chromed pipes again and I ve  owned 12 bikes..the wrap is great
B00PFX2YH4|5|Great protector!!! Perfect for a long day on the trail. Holds 3 liters of water. Storage compartments are perfect for a basic, trail side tool set. Space for ID, cash/debit card and cell phone. The built in cell phone compartment is even water proof. Fill it with water then put it on and snug up/tighten the harness and straps. This is the third type of this system/protector I've bought and tried. Leatt....you nailed it. Thank you.
B001DH4BLI|5|Great
B00318NQFY|1|They warn you that these bulbs are shorter life than other bulbs and they mean it. I got about six months out of one, and that's with the vehicle not used much at night since my daughter has it at college and doesn't even use the car during the week.
B008P5Z68I|5|Worked as expected.  Got my radio working again.
B008KZQS7Q|1|Failed after 40 days and Amazon won't warranty the part.  I know a Honda one is expensive, but it's worth the money.... or by the doorman one from a local parts store
B008I7ONOG|3|perhaps I didn't read the details but while it fit great and was simple enough to install myself, the actual electronic connection didn't fit my 2002 Toyota Avalon
B00DSGI9Q0|5|Perfect fit with lots of storage space.
B0000AY1W7|5|loved it good stuff
B000CODS80|1|I swear a dinner fork is stronger than this tool.  The metal tab bent with very little pressure.  If this will work for you then you probably don't need a tool in the first place, you will be able to remove your wiper by hand.  I had to go to an auto parts store and buy one of the screw-type wiper pullers.  Save your money, don't buy this piece of junk.
B000NBYDWW|5|nice tool
B00T0U02AO|5|Looks great on my car!
B00EP3PW4M|5|Very good quality! Instructions were easy to understand. Easy to install, about 45 minutes by myself! I would definitely recommend this product.
B008X5JIPM|5|Good for your bike so you won't mess up your other shoes
B002UC8LXE|5|Perfect fit, more parts then needed.
B00DC50PD2|5|Awesome
B00PA3XD2E|4|I agree with Crossfit Dadoh's review.  These mud guards fit well, but the hardware is somewhat lacking.  The hardware for the rear guards is better than for the front.<br /><br />The rear uses 4 speed nut clips on tabs on the existing rear bumper, with bolts that go through the guard.  According to the instructions there's a metal clip that goes at the top of the guard, but mine did not include such a clip.  The rear guards still seem to attach well enough with the 4 other bolts.<br /><br />Three of the bolts meant for the front are basically useless.  Only two pieces are useful: the plastic spacer and the long bolt that fastens the guard to it.  For the other 3 fasteners, just use the existing screws--they unscrew and then screw back in the same place.  For the spacer, it takes a fair bit of force to get the threads started.  Use a hammer or something to engage the threads (it'd help to screw the bolt through before you install it on the car).<br /><br />Even though the hardware is partly useless, the price on these things was right, and they seem OK.
B001DVTVZK|5|It was exactly what we expected. I love the quality, price, and timely delivery of Amazon and this particular dealer! Thanks a lot!
B00SA3S0O2|5|Great
B005BNP7UO|5|Good item looks good on the truck
B00KTIAREM|5|Works great
B008I2MPSM|5|I live in Texas and I drove past several cattle feedlots the other day. My air conditioner was set to &#34;recirculate&#34; so I didn't get the outside air (feedlots are VERY smelly). I did not get even one whiff of feedlot smell. This cabin air filter does, as far as I can tell, a great job!
B004I1768G|5|Very satified
B00EOX2KZ2|5|As described
B00FFIIHHU|4|Covers great, cures as the directions detail, and works well for  many applications. We use it for interior sound proofing and moisture penetration prior to insulating and carpeting. Seems substantially softer than other &#34;hot application&#34; liners .
B007FTV9Q8|5|Looks great and works perfect in the heat. We have temp as high as 110 and the vehicle is kept cool. It does the job well on very hot days. The only down side is that it does not fully cover the front for a Traverse vehicle.
B0055B121U|5|Spot on
B00I2Y4FGQ|5|Perfect
B005BRQY02|5|It was great purchasing experience. I highly recommend it.
B002QGVW3K|5|Excellent, as expected, works perfectly. Thank you
B00FLOOAUQ|3|Not a horrible aftermarket product for the money.  The nuts are snug, so they will not go on if you start them less than perfectly straight---but they did fit.  Installation wasn't bad, but don't tighten up the cross bar bolts until the ends are seated flat on the roof rails.  Probably worth what I paid.  The reason for not giving 4 or 5 stars is the WIND NOISE.  It's pretty bad below 60mph; although it gets drowned out passed that on our CRV.
B00BITKJNK|5|This is my second one. Very happy with quality and value of this filter. Thank you for the excellent product at a value price.
B005JTAXMW|5|Mine car looks great and it goes with the seat belt cushions.
B00CUFXUH8|5|Excellent
B00EDY7DUY|1|Lots of bubble after applying it on the window. Some part of the sticker also came out with the clear layer of it.
B00GAPA7QQ|5|Fit perfect took the old one out and put the new one in .
B001810SHA|2|works good until it leaks out even with stop leak installed also
B000A8FFTS|5|You have to have this dude specifically for the painless holder
B005NLQAHS|1|Doesn't work. Cant connect via Bluetooth MOSTLY, and when it rarely does the data is erratic. And I am using the recommended apps. On my phone and my phone and the apps check out good, SO ITS THE OBD READER, AND I'VE SEEN OTHER REVIEWERS SAY THE SAME THING. AND MY PHONE IS A ZTE ZMAX  with a  Snapdragon 4 core processor running On 1.2 Gigs AT 4g lte...
B0091YV1F4|5|they suprised me. they are pretty bright even at low voltage and mid day. i would buy more if i needed them. expected 3000 hour life though. not bad.
B00HY06VDY|2|Interior lights look great, easy to install and work fine but the tag lights started flickering less than a month after i got them.
B00JYMXTF8|5|worked as expected.  Easy to install.
B00KLL6VXI|5|excellent as described
B003SOKEXI|5|great fit good price
B000CQ4BAW|5|Very Nice
B00RV83UUG|5|Great and fast shipping very bright light
B0011YHOE4|1|The part fit as advertised like original.
B00FW1DRZC|5|Looks good no issues.
B00D3298A0|3|It fits alright, and can be trimmed to customize. My only complaint is that it skids around more than I was hoping. But after 8-9 months so far the material is holding up just fine.
B00T1YADSU|3|Can these be installed onto a roll bar
B0030GJ2SW|5|These are highly quality pads. They are thick, dense and easy to grip. I own 6 of these and they hold up use after use. A thorough wash with dish detergent and they're like new again. They work with polishes, sealants and waxes alike. I have used tons of different pads over the years and these are my favorite. Great job, Smart Wax.
B004KK553I|2|Not what I excepted!
B00BYH6C1E|5|This thing is life changing!
B000N9LF98|5|Great quality
B0045VHWUG|4|Great product at a great price!
B003N7IR7K|5|Good product!!!! now my bb is like brand new
B00T7CRL0E|5|The seat covers are wonderful.  Terrific fit and quality is excellent.  I'm using them on my 2015 Civic Coupe and recommend them.
B003E2AC0E|1|The finish flaked off after 6 weeks.
B0068NDBUE|5|Works really well!!!
B00O0SRA7E|2|The connector coming out of control box was no good.. The ground wire was not connecting.. So mine don't work
B002NF325U|5|Works great for my 2008 lincoln mkx. no problem with white stuff yet.<br />No mods needed.<br /><br />I purchased a different  (no name brand) and it was for a mazda cx7 and was supposed to fit... however it was 180deg out and would a needed minor mods to the case to fit correctly.
B0016GXNC4|5|Works great if you have water in your gas or use in winter time, highly recommend!
B005VTT3JY|5|Not an easy job but the part is perfect
B000C9QDMS|5|Great
B00GRHRTEU|5|Stay in place on highway look good and
B00P9OF04I|5|Needed to restore the headlights to my Jeep so I just went to my local Autozone and picked this product up. It worked amazing. Also used it on one of the Hondas my dad is fixing up and it's so clear now. I love this product!
B00HSG2XHM|5|Very easy to install.Took about 20 minutes, no adjusting or aiming needed for my install. Plug and play. I also purchased the KC 494 Fog Lights which I installed at the same time. These Headlights are MUCH better than the stock headlights, you will notice they are quite a bit brighter and whiter light. A bit pricey, but worth it if you plan on keeping your Jeep and like to see where you are going at night.
B00U8695HK|1|This is the biggest waste of money you could possibly buy.  This does nothing for scent/dust/or anything else in the car.
B00D8TXSCW|5|Its true isnt it..lmao
B00APOFQYQ|3|This does NOT fit a 1998 Honda Civic.  I know that wasn't what it was advertised for, but thought others might want to know.  It is close, but not close enough.
B001F85OUM|3|causes light warning (bulb out)2012 harley softail
B00GZLMEDO|5|Works so great it surprised me!  I have a 2007 FJ Cuiser with severely neglected black trim, and a lot of it. This stuff took off nearly 10 years off build up with very little effort to make it look new. Now I'm going to add the Back to Black Trim Restorer to bring the shine really out. I did a test spot with the Trim Restorer and it looked brand new using the both products together. I'd highly recommend this product if you just want to buy one, since this is a cleaner. But if you can get the Restorer also and it'll look new on bumpers and fender trims. 👍🏻👌👍🏻👌
B000O09ING|5|This was one of the best repairs I've ever done to my ford truck. Total job start to finish -20 minutes. No need for the special installation tool. Just mark a reference point for the orientation of body and one for the rotor. It's like a whole new truck!
B00CKZN21W|5|The rug is huge perfect size I love it so much its literally the best rug and its in great condition well worth the money

B0062A7M2G|5|I bought this the other day to try as an experiment to cover my gold (ugh) bowties on my Chevy. I was skeptical that it would fit the form of the bowtie as middle part is raised up from the edges (see photo). But with a little heat from a hairdryer and using the Lil Chiseler tool, it shrunk perfectly to the surfaces.<br /><br />My first attempt was more than passable but I messed up and cut one edge too short. My second attempt (pictured) came out perfectly and only took ten minutes. So there you have it, extremely easy to work with.<br /><br />The material seems to be of good quality but it's always unknown how well it'll hold up over time. It also look reasonably like carbon fiber but doesn't have the &#34;depth&#34; that real CF has. Might experiment with clearcoat to mitigate it. I'd probably try 3M's gloss version of this next.<br /><br />I'll give it five stars for now and monitor how well it holds up over time.
B001HBXDOG|5|Great product Fast Delivery+++++
B000COPBPI|5|To order THOSE units was mo problem. To fit them no problem and they are working perfect.<br />How ever some other parts I needed was a problem to order.<br />After completing the order then came the window, sorry but we do not ship to Spain.<br />But as said with those units and service I´m very happy.<br />Regards,<br />Mr. Alexander Bunschoten,<br />Spain
B006G5AY3G|4|Nice looking pillows.  I have used this type of pillow quite a lot. Unfortunately they tend to overfill this type of pillow so that it actually hurts my neck.
B001JT1IWU|5|Awesome product
B000BHKZIE|5|Worked as advertised. Nice quality set.
B0031GHBSE|5|Had plug neatly installed in 15 minutes.
B005G21JP2|5|Simple bolt in exact replacement works great.
B00LFL75I8|2|Ordered 2 of these and does not look like the one that came off of my car. One of these that i ordered has black seal on both sides and the other one that i ordered has metallic on both sides. The one that came off of my car has one black seal and metallic seal on the other side, although the product did came greased/oiled but i can't seem to trust it.
B00D42AFS8|5|Although we have a bulky battery pack, it is too cumbersome to keep in passenger vehicles.  We saw Pat Goss demonstrate a similar unit on Motor Week.  We shopped Amazon and thought that this model was a good value and would meet our needs.  We haven't needed a jump start yet but bought an additional units to have one in each vehicle.  They seem to hold charge well.  Very pleased.
B004FNPOV8|5|Fast delivery, great item
B0010GG7YG|5|Worked perfectly.  Watched a YouTube video on install, then did it myself in 10 minutes.  Easy fix.
B009VI5W82|4|ok
B009DK6CQO|5|It fit. No movement while driving. If needed will buy again.
B003NUGPK8|4|Worked and fit easy just had take front bumper off 11 Chevy equinox
B00441Y4UI|4|Good value kit. Just the ngk plugs and wires pay for themselves, everything else is a nice extra
B0019FJM9K|5|Fits very nice, looks good too
B007TG7IJY|5|(copied from Bosch 19-CA / 3397006505E7W)<br />Very great blade, very great customer service. I accidentally snapped a piece (see pictures) during installation, but later learned that I didn't &#34;need&#34; that piece anyway and the blade still connected without a problem. Sure as heck stood the test of last year's winter (here in the tri-state area), and do need replacing. I contacted customer service in regard to the broken piece and was eventually sent a replacement set of Bosch Evolution blades on the house that I haven't put on yet because I keep procrastinating. Only thing that kinda sucks in the regard is that I had to wait until after the holiday(s) since it was just around New Year's, and the company was on break, pretty much. No big deal, I'm grateful for the helpful customer service! Would definitely buy again!
B00062YSJG|5|Did the trick. Good instructions.
B00E4W9IEO|5|Great replacement for worn out awning handles. Includes the correct pop rivets. Perfecto!
B001Q96Y7C|5|Love it
B00KN0UOEE|5|This stuff is great. I use it for my plastic kayaks and also truck and car. What I like best is that it leaves a great low-gloss shine and is not greasy or streaky like some other protectants. It also does not leave an overly slick finish so it can be used on all surfaces. I go from leather to plastic to vinyl to rubber with excellent results. It does not attract dirt and dust and in fact seems to repel it.
B004GZOLP0|4|Easy to install. Very happy with purchase. Shows scratches & dings though. Would still recommend due to its price point. Just don't plan on crashing through fences with this thing and not seeing any scratches.
B0000UUX2U|5|worked fine, looked good
B003YKX44M|5|Just put them on my 12 ram 1500 quad and it only took minutes.  Fit perfectly with no modification. Looks great. Very good quality. I'm happy and would recommend them to others.
B0064BRMKA|5|A fine product, very functional.  Reasonably priced.
B003X9TLUK|5|That was the right part for my lawnmower
B00QE4UPRE|1|Looked nice but the adhesive was garbage fell off after first wash
B00N396SHE|5|Thanks
B00GURKMQ4|5|The windshield looks great and easy to apply, The service and shipping was great.and  I plan to come back soon for more, I installed this on motorized bicycle and it looks great ---Thanks !
B00R1FNDDI|4|good product just what i expected
B000CC99NU|5|It does what it is supposed to do. Good Tach.
B004HXE2B4|5|Usable if you work with miniture items. worked for me
B00S2U6AK4|5|Arrived as advertised
B001HR4BAK|5|Bearing works great
B00ANZW28U|3|Did not fit properly on Honda accord ex 2008
B00684MXL6|4|This wiring harness works great. I recently used this to install my new stereo in my 2000 Subaru Outback. Had no issues in the least with the product its self my only critique is that would have been nice if the was some protection for shipping. This arrived in one of those standard shipping &#34;bags&#34; (white outside silver inside) and i just felt lucky the plastic housing wasn't damaged in transit, even a thing sheet of bubble wrap would have been nice. I will be buying another one of these for my Fiance's car next. I give this a strong 2 thumbs up and would recommend it to anyone needing to replace a Subaru car stereo within the years shown for it. [[ASIN:B00I9ASI70 BOSS Audio BV7460 In-Dash Single-Din 4.6-inch Detachable Touchscreen DVD/CD/USB/SD/MP4/MP3 Player Receiver with Remote]] 4 out of 5 stars because of shipping materials used
B002NFI4IU|1|Very cheap material.  Very disappointing.  Didn't even use it.  Looks like cheap, low-grade astroturf.
B004I0H86C|5|As advertised, no problems, fast shipping.
B000GZPH2U|2|not wide and gets in the way
B00FH2A470|5|Looks good
B004I0HXCG|5|These fit in a 1994 Jeep Grand Cherokee perfectly.
B0083H4SMI|5|The electric mirror adjuster on my Suburban mysteriously stopped working.  After checking my fuses, I decided to try a new switch.  Problem solved.  It took 5 minutes to install and works great!
B000BWAOWG|4|Fit my Chevy small block as promised<br />The paint from the factory is just for rust protection while shipping.  It needs to be sandwith blasted off and a good hi-temp paint applied; but this is true for all uncoated headers.
B00KVO4RZY|5|good
B005RJ3GBE|1|The guts to my remote do not fit in this one. Do not buy it!!!! It said it was for my year remote!
B003RVKYZU|5|works perfect
B000C57L3M|5|Installed in a flash and worked like a charm..! Wish getting the old ones off was as easy...
B00NFSNAS8|1|Received this in the mail on 8/7/15 and immediately use the unit to inflate my MTB tire.  Compressor ran normally.  Unfortunately, pressure gauge meter remained at 0 reading.  Tried running the compressor on other tires, but gauge remained unresponsive and stuck at 0.
B000CSGWZM|5|Excellent Plugs. NGK makes excellent plugs, the best if you ask me. These particular iridium plugs went into my 2009 kawasaki ZX6-R. I do recommend these for that application (motorcycles) specifically for the extended life of the plugs as well as the fat clean spark you will get.
B0016LFWFK|3|Most freezers have a defrost cycle, and this always alarms on it.  So the alarm is off.  need to be able to set the alarm temp.
B00GGX5W3A|5|Very nice
B008XJHR5Q|5|Snug fit - what else can you ask for.
B00U1TPAQ4|5|it works good i didnt realize it was 300ftlbs it met my expectations for what i need it for  hadnt tried it out yet i guess i will see when i instal the pulleys
B009SN5OO2|5|Perfect. Took a while to ship. But these are better than OEM. I am very pleased. They fit perfectly on my 2012 Mazdaspeed3
B00ICHZV0C|2|The plastic cut me the day i got this pill container. It is not smoothed out. And the puls don't stay on their compartments, so when you open the box after it has been on your bag they are all mixed up.
B001TK7CYM|5|Great product and precisely what I wanted.  I am going to use these for a totally different usage than the majority of the buyers have used them for.  I wanted these for usage when I use my lawn trimmer, and my leaf blower.  I have been to the eye doctor twice, in the past 3.5 months, due to crap getting into my eye.  I was using 'safety glasses', which were totally non-productive.  They were open at the bottom and top of the frame, which let stuff come in from below and above.  I tried the clear, plastic safety goggles, but they made my entire face sweat.  These goggles fit well, are sealed around the eyes, and do not bury my face in a sweat factory.  They both offer UV protection, and with the dark pair, I don't need my sun glasses.  The clear pair is good for a dark day, or evening work.  I am happy!  Oh, yes, another thing.  These will be good on a bike ride, where heavy wind is blowing crap all over the place, even with colder winds that cause the eyes to react, just when standing still, watching an outdoor event.
B00GHT79Z2|4|Work good! No complain yet!
B0082365AQ|2|Really disappointed after using 3 or 4 times the tires went flat and separated & cracked. Have had no luck finding site to buy new tires. Assuming defective tires would expect  manufacturer to offer options.
B00GUMWVHW|5|Love it! Just like the picture
B00199BO4C|2|I bought the pertronix's electronic ignition then I bought the coil.  I had some questions on removing a resistor for the distributor so I decided to use the stock coil which worked fine.  The coil would not start the engine with out the resistor removal so I left everything stock and went back to the standard coil and then I got the spark I was looking for.
B009DJQJIG|5|Needed small adjustment fit better than I expected. Would buy again.
B00JRISNZK|5|Excellent
B00466FJ0K|3|Couln't figure out how it as supposed to work effectively.  Does anyone have a success story using it with glass showers?
B000C9CH4Q|4|Installation tip: these four pads are not identical.  Two are for inboard, two for outboard.  You can tell them apart by looking at the wear indicators.  The pad that has a wear indicator on both ends is loaded first (they can only be loaded from one end) and the one with only one wear indicator is loaded last.  If you try to reverse that arrangement, one wear indicator will bump against the adapter frame and not align correctly.<br /><br />The packaging of these pads was awful.  They were just loaded into a small box with no binding or packing material.  They were, however, undamaged, save for some surface rust on the spring steel backs.
B00QCFXOJG|1|It's cheap quality n not at all worth for this price
B000QV0FIA|5|love it good quality !!!
B007P4V8KU|5|Made the window that would stay up just like new.  Very nice product.
B00CLUYFNA|3|they may be rated for a lot ....however due to the design and the amount of metal they actually &#34;grab&#34; in the bed  they should only be rated for 250lbs anything over that they will pull out!
B000E7WLJW|5|I've actually enjoyed this item so far.  It made extra room in jeep for camping.<br />For those who don't know,  you do need to put it together.  May take a little bit of time.  I do recommend the separate cargo bag as well.  If we had not gotten it,  everyone would have been covered in dirt and mud where we went camping.  Even on the dirty street,  so a great extra to have!
B00SZ5GOXY|5|WORKED AS DESCRIBED.
B0040CTTH4|5|Works perfectly at a small fraction of the cost of dealer parts.<br />It's hard to remove the inside panels on a Toyota van without breaking at least one of these.... and by the time you buy three at the dealer, you could have had this whole bag of 25.<br />Except for the color these look and work identically as compared to what came from the Toyota factory.<br />Delivered quickly, too.<br /><br />ALL good.
B00BFU9HWG|4|I just installed the StableLoad Quick Disconnect on my 2008 Chevy 3500 dually.  I had also previously installed a Hellwig rear sway bar.  I had to modify one of the StableLoads in order to make it clear the sway bar.  I removed the top bar from the StableLoads.  This allowed the top overload springs to make contact at about the same time the rear bottom overloads to make contact.  The StableLoads did improve the ride and handling.  I would recommend them for the price.  I should also state that I carry a 9.5 foot truck camper.
B004OAC02S|5|I LIKE IT.
B0083Z2S7M|5|I have had a severe break if my upper arm and shoulder that required surgery. From the surgery, I got wrist drop which all really made doing every day tasks difficult. That included driving. Was recommended to try one of these.  Based on reviews, I went with this one. My brother installed on my Kia Optima. It took a couple of tries, but it's now on Welland really helped me to get back on the road with confidence.
B0062AO8UA|5|The product arrived as promised and fits perfectly on my car.
B002WP362U|3|short use.
B00NPA11XW|5|Used this item to retrofit a Vespa 250 GTS H4 headlight.  I had to use a round knife sharpener to open up the headlight hole just a tad.  Then the unit fit with the original holder.  The harness wired up and was place in the right side of the head cover making sure that the steering function was not affected.  Anchored them with plastic ties.  Beautiful and bright lights that make sure that you can see and be seen.<br />I purchased mine at Cyclegear not knowing that Amazon carried them.  Posted the review to help others with this great choice.
B002OUIXU8|3|You can NOT use the Camco Rhino hose with the sewer end connected to the hose as it does not come off to connect to this adapter. The cheaper Camco hose works as the sewer end needs to be attached and can be removed.
B00BTMV4YE|5|The lights work great and easy to install. The kit comes with with a 2 light pigtail. I've installed another brand that only has a connection for 1, the big difference is,  I am able to add a tube without having to remove and rewire the light.<br /><br />Only 3 of the 6 kits were complete with wirenuts.
B002NF0J4C|5|perfect fit. Cheapest on Amazon as compared to auto stores. Make sure u use the routing diagram from the previous review. You can get the belt removal tool as a loan from advance auto. Its literally for free if u return it. It needs a 19 mm wrench to then the pulley. Make sure you leave the belt off the alternator for reinstalling , twist the pulley slide it back onto the alternator
B001J4XP6W|5|Good part at reasonable price
B000CI6Z86|4|Good fit and fast shipping , no problems at all
B000K022N8|5|Perfect match for my Chevy Silverado
B007N3RW9Y|5|good~~
B000VKTUD2|5|Great fit, on time delivery.<br /><br />Dealer quoted me 4xs as much to replace the filter.  Purchase this air filter, which comes sealed tight with instructions.  Smelled the freshness when I opened the inside packaging.  Took me longer to open the shipping box and container than it did for this 30 second replacement.<br /><br />Will purchase again when the need arises.
B000MKF38C|4|A very neat and well made product. It creates a great finish to bike and adds to comfort.
B00TR1RCDQ|5|Covered up the huge hole after replacing the old Bose speakers, works as it should the speaker mounts well.
B00NQ198LC|5|Works great for my Thule racks, easy install.
B008XB9BJY|5|I bought several LED replacement style and manufactured bulbs for my Travel Trailer...... we are often in the back country of Colorado with only solar for our power supply. The Brightech BA15 had the warmest out put of the four I tried and it is over our dining area. It gives a warm light more like an incandescent and perfect ambience for dinners. The others were used in the bathroom and kitchen prep area where a whiter spectrum was OK. Last week end we had three days off grid and left with a fully charged battery......buy these... they work!
B000SL4AA2|2|I've had this compressor for a year and a half, using it occasionally for approximately 50 hours total over that time span.  It has now  died; no longer works.  Worked well when it worked, but feel that it  was not abused and should have lasted much longer.  Do not recommend.
B00FZHULUM|4|Excellent, arrived on time
B00K0KA8U2|5|Awesome, great, love it
B002PL9UI0|5|Just what we needed for our camper when ours gave out.  Came on time for our planned trip to Georgia!!
B00VGL820M|5|Just as expected.
B003TTRORQ|5|Best stuff ever
B00FRHOLK6|5|Excellent blades for a 2012 Kia Soul
B00V9HP1Z2|5|Great product!  Lots of comments.  Looks great on a 2000 xterra.  No problems.  Bright as hell.
B00BC372EG|4|Really nice and comfortable helmet until at speeds above 70mph then starts to pull up, not off, and chokes the s*** out of you..lol..but worth the money for sure.. chin straps are nice, hope it last a long time!!
B00H9MYO68|5|Better than I expected. Very stable & comfortable.
B002696FA2|1|This is the worste product no one buy it cause it's not true. It damaged my car
B00LW834Z2|5|They work fine
B008O475WA|5|The best parts
B00A6AS6LY|5|A must have for the do it yourselfer. Makes the whole coolant swap process super easy and virtually mess free.
B00V30J86I|5|This is made nice. A little smaller than I thought it would be but it holds things in my car from flying around
B0007Y7Q10|5|Perfect, all though I put mine on 6' x 12&#34; plank!
B00CB280WU|5|Have over two years use so far, I'd go for a factory gasket set as the aftermarket ones are not as good.
B00DZKCXD4|5|These lights are stupid bright and hella easy to install. Good build. Decent quality. Even came with the mounting bracket. No complaints. Thanks Kawell!
B00BTS2M6C|5|Love it 💖
B00FH2CMPM|5|Fit nice, looks good. Got rid of those old clouded headlights with broken moisture seals.  Made a world of difference.
B007OZ2VC4|5|This is a very user-friendly OBD-II reader. I am no mechanic, so I was only able to test it on one car so far (a Ford Crown Vic) but it worked great. It gave me precise error codes, andI  was able to turn off the Check Engine light. Not having to go to the shop has paid for the reader itself, but I know I will get a lot more use out of it. Comes with very understandable instructions (which is rare these days...).
B00KVVROCA|5|Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service
B000C7LYVK|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING 5 STAR QUALITY
B00LLM3JTU|5|Just what we needed, and got here in 4 days in we live in a little tiny town
B00L7E80IW|2|They fit in the Tempo holder, but hang down after removing first tissue.  Much thinner than the original tempo tissues.  They do the job for the most part.
B00QOYA2VI|5|Very bright light. Fit perfectly in place of factory light. Wires could be a little longer.
B0031ZDU62|5|Great product, great price.
B00BG8O68M|5|I'm glad I perches this cover it looks great and it keeps my items safe. I recommend it.
B00DNOHE9K|5|Does a nice job and last a long time. Cleaning the brake parts is recommended.
B001CF4UXU|5|You can't go wrong. Heavy Duty.
B001P29O5Y|5|Very happy with it. Great deal. Now all the kids i dont have can ride bikes wherever we go!
B00GUS5UUG|5|Fits perfect, top quality.
B000I0VKGK|5|Good tool to use to start removing a core under pressure so that you don't break the valved tool made for replacing cores under pressure.
B00WFJ4GPE|5|Performed as expected
B00F6E1H8E|5|This is the one you want for the rear window of the Dodge Magnum. It's oem. It's the right one. I installed it on my maggie and it's exactly the same as the old one.
B00Y1HTY64|5|These keys worked great, although I had to have a locksmith program the vehicle for them since I only had one original key.
B003NBFMMY|4|Good value
B00JBI9S28|3|decent fit, one of the adjuster screws came pre-striped
B007XWU54E|3|Fits but will need to buy a test pipe with it because it will not fit on a Stock catalitic converter.
B00X2TUW1I|4|works great but when I lowered my window in error they got caught and it tore!!!  getting new ones though
B00YBGAX2E|5|works great
B00EURP0U4|1|This product is incredibly cheaply made. It appears they put approximately 2 minutes into writing the assembly instructions.<br /><br />In order to install the heater element, you must first remove a few screws holding the end caps on. No big deal right?.. Except for the fact that some idiot cross threaded the screw at the factory!!<br /><br />To say I'm disappointed in the quality of this product right now is a giant understatement.  I had to use pliers and scratch the finish on a expensive light because this company sent me a product put together by a moron.
B00LG07MZE|4|“The shade is too big for my windshield....but still works fine!”
B001KOH0PI|5|No more resting my helmet on my desk. This hanger is fantastic and super simple to use or move to a new location.
B003PERH9K|5|Received on 1st day of delivery window, easy to install, looks great on my truck.
B001T9QOLA|5|Good quality, easy to install.

B004RNR9QY|5|I make a misteded i toch bottom by the ithem i take theithem
B00CYTUXDY|3|No bushings as picture shows, ball joint wouldn't hold camber setting unless I put on like hulk worth the $$ I paid I guess not much more
B004779IBE|4|Nice long handle allows me to reach the full dash and inside windshield.
B00DILUBL6|5|Works great and is priced well.
B005U80UQ6|5|Very good and heavy duty.  Almost eliminates all vibration.  They are so good you sometimes check your foot to make sure they are on the pegs.  You don't feel the vibration of the bike at all...
B009DJSEM0|3|didn't come with the bowtie in the center
B000C9SR90|5|Working great

B00SBVU4R4|5|loved it!
B001QIYAQ0|5|Awesome troubleshooting tool. Must have for your toolbox
B00NPAZ2BY|5|Very nice welds and hold up to casing jumps thanks
B0113GU4NC|4|Well crafted. I have an odd complaint though. This listing failed to mention that the metal seat belt garnish comes with as well. In total, i received 5 items. 3 metal door cach plates, 1 chrome skull emblem, and 1 metal seatbelt garnish. I had purchased the same seatbelt garnish from a different seller. Had this item listing mentioned it came with the seat belt garnish, I would have bought it immediately.
B004K8KZ8K|5|I've bought so many inexpensive sunshades and they never fit/work right. I'm usually a penny pincher but this is well worth the money! It's heavier and fits my 2013 Soul EXACTLY! It helps keep my car cooler and doesn't take any time at all to put up.
B00ZR4JQBI|5|Few issues when installing on 08 Wrangler: written instructions were useless...check out you tube for help...after removing rear brake light, you will see 2 &#34;clips&#34;. One clip you can push in with a finger, the other needs a flathead screwdriver to push in...you only need to remove those 2 clips and the other clips will release when you wiggle old filler tube out., make sure the rubber grommet that you remove from original filler goes on new filler tube the same way...also, new filler tube had 2 tiny plastic nubs that I had to trim off with pliers (easy) before it installed flush with the rear quarter panel...then you line up the filler door and snap onto jeep...looks really nice on my black jeep...Update!!!! Now my frigin check engine light is on!!!! Could be due to gas cap not fitting tightly!!!!Will investigate and update...
B000KU74MM|5|Everything about this purchase was awesome!
B00WFHWUN6|3|It gave just under 2 miles to the gallon mileage. So...was hoping for more, but not a total fail.
B00KLZ65GM|5|Love it
B0076I39NO|1|This filter appears to work with earlier Impreza's that have the filters mounted under the hood. It does not work with any Subaru with a tank mounted filter.
B00BZSE5CK|5|Excellent
B000S2SKIY|5|Shipped quick and fit perfect!
B0041WSN52|5|Item as described, all functions work like factory mirror
B003BJPWZK|5|works real good
B007JMOUNK|4|This snatch block is what was advertised and is just what I need. Not a monster but big enough to handle any load I may encounter
B000M5ZVFC|3|Nothing special, just restocking my supplies
B00RXETSY0|2|Not very strong, for price it is ok. Ships from China  so don't get in a hurry.
B00KTP4138|5|fits nicely
B00EHIPPQK|5|Great lights, great price, and fast shipping. If you are looking for lights to light your whole street these are the ones.
B00UZRBM0U|5|It was good
B00LLI9XU8|2|way to small doesn't do anything for u
B00VFMAIMM|1|Bought it, worked greator about 30 mins then hasn't worked since.
B00E5PYUXE|5|These seatbelt adjusters worked perfectly for my wife who is quite short.  She now rides in complete comfort whereas before the seatbelt was coming across her neck.  My only concern is for her safety because when properly installed they do not adjust on sudden forward movement.  So, you have to make sure you do not give too much space.  I had her put her hand between her body and the seatbelt and I adjusted it to that much space.
B004N4AOKK|5|Perfect fit
B005QC6NWQ|5|Cute, cute, cute!
B000J3ZW8S|5|Fits beautifully!  Keeps the car COOL!
B005CDSSGS|5|Great fit in my 61 c10. Cools very good and at an affordable price.
B004IYSYH0|5|Are you in need of a new low beam harness connector, than look no further since you found it. This item was for an 04 Express 3500 that had damage to front end due to an accident. The little plug for the low beam was damaged. I called around but the pricing to me seemed high. So to amazon I went and low and behold I found this quickly. Nothing fancy, just a product that does what it supposed to do. Get yourself two quick crimps connectors and some electrical tape and in 15 minutes you'll be back in business. Thanks Dorman and Amazon for product and great service.
B00NITFROE|5|Great fit! Just what I wanted!
B00BQYCJKI|5|These have become my favorite tool to uses from quick detailing and removing wax\sealant
B00T0XI8ZM|5|tints are very good quality and precisely cut. Great customer service, they helped me out when i messed up the installation. Im happy with these tints.
B000C1LW0E|5|great pump . I put it on a john deere 420 and now it starts in 5 seconds rather than 5 min after it has not been started in a week.
B00SOK3ZQ4|1|One light lasted a few seconds and the second made in a few tries of testing my connections. Total time couldn't have been more than 1 minute of use.
B000C2SBKW|5|Fit great been in the car for about three months have not had any problems with it and received item when I was promised
B007ED9JFS|4|These are great! Got the eyes for my plane just before the movie Planes came out, and Kids and adults alike love them! After two years now the material is deteriorating and flaking apart, one of the suction cups has fallen out, and the Velcro is weak; time to get another set!
B00EDWF1BE|4|I have a Wrangler JK and with these, no more hood flutter.<br />No drilling required. but you need to move the grill to install. The tools list and instructions for install that came with are not good - You'll need metric wrench/sockets and hex key.<br />There are good u-tubes on both installing the hood catch and removing the grilll
B000C31J9G|5|it fit
B00B50EI8Y|4|have used this stuff for 30 years. keeps shoes new and protect from weather. for smooth leather. My packaging was different however. And I wonder if they changed the formula slightly because it wasn't the same as the last 30 year worth I have purchased in the store. Bottle was all white. The bottle in the picture above is what I was expecting and what I normally see. It seems like they may have changed the formula slightly too. maybe 4 stars now instead of 5.
B008BR7A1G|5|Direct fit to my outlander 2015 (3row SUV). Swapping took 5 minutes. It came with OSRAM H11 bulb. Lenses are glass. Great bargain comparing to OEM price.
B000E4CO88|4|The mirror fits as it should and is easy to install. It arrived packaged well and in good shape. There is some vibration when driving but not too bad and it seems to stay put once adjusted. I would purchase again if needed.
B0029TQDLA|2|Disappointed that the hanger broke off after 4 months, love the concept but not sturdy enough and I only hung it when I parked in a handicap spot
B000K03RH8|4|Good fit. looks a little different than oem but fits perfect
B0009V1WS4|1|Piece of junk; rusted and corroded in a few months; key hole is so corroded cannot insert key to open - have to get the core drilled out or something. Chrome is not as good as stainless steel but this chrome plating is cheap. Do not purchase this product.
B00DSMEL2A|1|Crap, get sea foam to truely clean a carb
B0002M7E50|3|The mirrors are ok. seem a bit weak. I have a lot of vibration.
B002W2A108|5|If you use a uni filter on anything this kit is a must. It has the cleaner and oil. Never use motor oil like some people suggest on forums. Motor oil deteriorates the filter and will clog up a carburetor.
B00KLZ65GM|2|Looking at it on here one would believe it's really black and stays black when stretched. But it doesnt. It has approx. 2 inches of space under the eyes so that has to be folded under. But hey what can you really expect for $2?
B00XGVRG20|5|Fit perfectly on my 2014 R1. The look without the mirrors is extremely aggressive. I recommend buying bar end mirrors with it.
B00CMR79H6|5|Very usefull.  Fits perfect
B0051SFWXQ|5|The filter fits 2004 Jeep Liberty 3.7 just fine. I'm on my 4th or 5th one and never had a single issue.
B00139FQSS|5|I could never bring myself to using a pretty, glass fuse, in my 4awg wire that drops the size down to about 18awg. Makes not sense to me. This breaker makes more sense and it can be used to cut the power if needed, without disconnecting the battery cables.
B001V8U12M|4|SURE BEATS USING A CRANK!  DON'T USE A DRILL OVER 15 VOLTS<br />BECAUSE THE TORQUE OF A 18 V CAN BREAK YOUR WRIST.  I<br />BOUGHT AN 18V FOR $20 AND WHEN I WAS ALL THE WAY UP IT<br />TORE ITSELF FROM MY HAND.<br /><br />MY FIRST ONE WALKED OFF SO GETTING ANOTHER.
B007Q3A09A|5|Nice decal, stands out on tinted windows.
B000CB94WM|5|Right  fit so it will  take me a while to know  the breathing suction
B0000AUSEW|5|Cooks hot dogs and s'mores like a champ. It was bent pretty good when it arrived though.
B00CHT32XE|5|I usually wear Carhartt sweatshirts which are high quality.  I bought this to have a little more protection and it seems similar high quality as the Carhartts to me.  I think these armored sweatshirts are supposed to fit snugly to keep the armor in place.  I like it a lot
B00ZMOAKJA|5|Nice product it works like it says it does I used it on my lawnmower today I got the item in today vary fast shipping it cost 24.99 plus free s.h it's for cars and trucks too no disel u can use this on all automobiles it comes with 4 spark plug adapters rubber hose it test crank shafts and transverse axis too nice buy thank u
B00MOBP3AK|5|Great item
B003G0KBK0|5|Love them!
B00T5CPBMQ|1|Hard to find a video found a bmw video that showed where to put the clips and stuff bout to put them on! Link to instruction video: http://youtu.be/DQ-fpK9yL2s
B002E5FOPK|5|Ac working again even when idling. Just what we needed.
B00HGHM468|4|Worked well but i didnt like the feel on my dual sport. I used these on my street bikes though. Didnt slip or move.
B006YBAN1K|4|Perfect fit Q5 TDI 2015, still need to see how great they are going to be in winter.
B00XV8V2NC|5|It came in a very timely manner. It fit perfectly. We are extremely happy with this purchase and would buy from this vendor again, hopefully NOT because my husband kills a backup light again!
B0040CW1EC|5|Works as expected.
B000BO9TMU|3|The air tank is of good quality, but the hose is not.  The adapter will not fit the valve stems on the tires I was going to use the tank to fill.
B001EOYIH2|5|Installed on my 2005 Crown Victoria.  Drilling the holes in the frame was the hard part.  The hitch went on just as it should.
B00DUDTXO8|5|Works great
B000BVRZ74|5|If you've used this before, you know what a great product it is. Every car and every driver deserves to have this treatment on the windows. Your windows not only look better, but driving is SAFER with the increased visibility!!
B00HUG10EC|1|Scent lasted about an hour for me at most.  Will not buy again.
B000CF1Y7G|5|This pump DOES the filter screens per tech support from Bosch   The box is mislabeled  THIS PUMP DOES LIVE UP TO BOSCH'S HIGH STANDARDS
B001GBRIKW|5|Quick & easy installation. Definitely notice a difference when stepping on the pedal.
B0027AGFPA|1|I received these parts on May 12, 2015, They seemed to be perfect fit quality parts, but they have already failed. I had to replace them on 8/03/2015. Less than 90 day service life! Just as noisy as before.
B0007N20WQ|5|I ordered this kit for our 1993 Jaguar.  Let me tell you, this stuff is easy to use and boy does it make the car smell great!  This product was recommended as part of leather conditioning on the Jaguar forum, and I'm glad I decided to take their advice.
B002UZSIZW|5|Awesome switches. They are easy to install. But be aware that these don't come with soldered wire that the Red ones do. I have 4 of these in my car for various applications and they have worked pretty well till now. I plan to put in more in the future. Although they could have used LEDs instead of filament bulbs. They would have been brighter.
B00VNBEJ1G|5|These are great lights, super bright.
B003BZ9LRO|5|Great sound. It is loud so don't buy this if u don't want it loud it's perfect for my<br />Mud truck tho prob wouldn't put on a newer truck
B0049ECE16|5|Works great on my 2010 Ford F150 Crew 4x4 XLT.
B0067F2CEE|5|Purchased this for my 09 Sporty. Absolutely love the look and fit. Contrary to several reviews, install was a snap, especially if you watch the factory u-tube video and pay attention. It only took me 45 mins and 15 of those minutes was unpacking and sorting the hardware for easy ID . Forget the paper instructions, watch the video. The poly is very thick, sturdy and excellent optical clarity in viewing area even though I set the height just below eye level in a seated position.  The clarity of the cowling does not detract from the looks of the bike, and actually hard to notice at a distance, and close up does not hide your chrome handlebars etc.  The aerodynamics feel good, relieved a lot of wind pressure from my chest at speeds over 40mph, especially when trucks blast by in opposite direction. After riding without a windshield for some time, this shield gives greater confidence against the dreaded june bugs, bees  and stray gravel FOD on  the body, face and hands. I have got several compliments on it's sleek look on my Harley. Police style windshields simply don't cut it on a XL Sportster.  Absolutely love it.
B004GZ346M|1|Bad product ,after 2 wk  they care where testing and told me  this alternator does not working well , and the mechanic ,i paid  $150 for just instillation  . he is not responsible for bad product , I don't know what to do ,it should be one year warranty.
B00WAXVN6A|5|Well constructed product for a great price!!!
B0006SU3QW|4|The product is great. It did what I needed it to do. It is easy to apply and dries fast and stays like rubber.
B00ATPWRSY|5|I purchased for a friend of mine and he is very happy with it.
B00SIOE1LE|5|Works really well. Kept my bumper in place
B00BZYIF1Q|5|Beautiful chrome metal plate holder. Easy to install. Looks great on any Ram truck.
B00KCQSIRY|5|Love it! Best seat covers I've found that fit!!! Recommend! Nice and comfortable!
B001UFI8DA|5|Looks great on the front of the truck
B000CNJ6JG|3|Thought I ordered 50/50, but made it work.
B00WC4GY0W|4|nice finish, decent size as well.
B00BP5VWRY|5|These are straight from the anus of a goat in tiawan who drives a scooter in his spair time off from his job of melesting baby elephants for payback for the elephant goat war
B004FS3TS8|4|Fits my helmet, keeps the wind from getting behind my glasses.
B00TF8G110|5|Nice cover for what it cost but to big for my Suzuki Ozark 250
B00DJ4FOFA|5|Great oil!!! Its all I ever used in all my muscle cars.
B00JW1WCAY|3|would have been nice  if it mated to<br />Hayden Automotive 397 Transmission Line adapter
B00K2E63UA|4|Decent aftermarket product. Fit pretty well, but not quite as good as an OEM part. Close enough that 99% of people won't even notice. Semi-difficult installation, but our 20-something daughter did this in an afternoon, so not impossible. There are plastic pieces that you need to remove from the old ones that the screw goes into. You NEED to REUSE these from the old lenses. These do not come with them. The look is great, and so far no leaks. Would recommend.
B002DZJQ0A|1|Terrible...SAVE YOUR MONEY!  The first place I tried to use this product..it would not stick!  Surface was cleaned with alcohol and other double sided tape did stick.  WOW.  I do know how to prepare the surface and have used similar products before.
B008BRJ6B8|1|Bought a set, one blew out the first week. Second one died 3 weeks later.
B001TJXWH4|5|Works as stated.  Strongly suggest pre-soaking them in a bucket and hand rinsing them prior to machine washing.
B00BRAVGZK|5|Easy to install. Good reception. Good price.
B00GSAUHB8|5|My sunshade I purchased, was phenomenal and was the right fit for my X5 thanks
B00AZJYDQI|5|Great tool
B003UGXO72|5|These are very cool key chains.  They go beautifully with our hummers!  They are really good quality.
B0096T6PEQ|5|Fit my sportster perfectly and the quality is brilliant and solid.
B002U6ELS4|5|This has made my transmission drains easier. I can't believe the tools at Chevy didn't have one already, yet expect you to do maintenance on the vehicle often.<br /><br />Buy the extra gasket though. The one that comes with it will leak. Amazon has a good one that I didn't get, (but I would've if I'd known), but autozone had a multi pack that I used.
B002UC4UKW|4|Good product....exactly what i expected.
B0024NSUEY|5|I bought a 2005 Mazda 3 S hatchback about 10 months ago, and the headlights on it were terribly oxidized. No method, product, or even buffing made much of a difference in appearance, and they cast really poor light in the dark.<br /><br />I learned how to install these thanks to YouTube, but it still took me and my dad 4 hours to do the whole thing. The instructional video I saw was for the sedan model, not the hatchback. Apparently, the Mazda 3 hatchback is not only different from the sedan in the rear, but also the front.<br /><br />Here's what I recommend for the install:<br />1. Go on YouTube and type in &#34;Replace Mazda 3 headlight assembly&#34; (or something to that effect) and watch the excellent video by jimthecarguy. Follow his directions for bumper removal.<br />2. The bolts in the wheel wells on the hatchback are actually pop-out pins. You will need a flathead screwdriver or two to do this. It took the strength of my dad and I both to pop some of them out. It's also a good idea to buy some extras just in case you break one on removal. They're pretty cheap on eBay.<br />3. The headlight assemblies on the hatchback come out with a plastic piece attached to the bottom. Be sure to unscrew the screw holding it to the assembly and pop the plastic tabs to remove. Don't forget to put these parts on the new assemblies!<br />4. Before I put the new assemblies in, I cleaned the plastic pieces up with some soap and water and polished the headlight covers with Mothers Plastic Polish for an extra protective coat and shine.<br />5. Reverse the steps you took to take everything apart so you can put it all back together!<br /><br />NOTE: If you need to replace one or both of your fog light bulbs, it is prime time to do it with the bumper removed. Make sure you don't put excessive tension in the wires running to the fog light assemblies when you pull the bumper off. Stick a cardboard box about 4&#34; tall under the bumper to hold it in place, or something else about thatheight.<br /><br />ANOTHER NOTE: One of my lightbulb sockets for my low-beam bulb looked very burnt and corroded, and was so bad that the low-beam light didn't always come on. I bought a replacement part for $6 on eBay, and I recommend you check these and do the same if needed.<br /><br />These headlight assemblies make all the difference in the world. It was a tough job, but made easier if you have someone to help you. The car looks 10 years newer!
B00G1XB8RO|5|This is one of the only portable automatic satellite dishs that I'm aware of that can utilize both the Eastern arc satellites as well as the Western arc satellites. Most portable dishes can only access the Western arc.  It's a little bit bigger  and a ittle bit heavier than its competitors but if you live anywhere on the East Coast and camp anywhere where there's trees this is a good pick to insure you can get a signal.
B003AOOMK2|1|Dry product, the bulb portion tore very easily. I might have received an old batch.......I will be returning the product.
B002E59QCC|5|Great product, looks very well made, operates smoothly. Fast shipping.
B007RZT19M|5|peffect for my application, great price, fast ship A+A+A+A+A+A+A+
B006RMC8J6|5|Makes the impossible Possible!!!😃 This says it all! Spray it on the decal mounting side, spray it on the vehicle mounting surface, position decal on vehicle, spray Rapid-Tac on top of decal to lubricate for squeegee, and begin to squeegee out the air bubbles and excess Rapid-Tac from trapped between the decal and mounting surface. Do this quickly as there is about a 2 minute window before the Rapid-Tac begins to grab. Wipe surrounding overspray off using microfiber towel and wait approximately 1 hour before peeling off transfer paper at a sharp angle to the mounting surface.
B00FS9O1BC|1|Trunk Emblem incorrect!
B0023VKVV2|5|Item arrived super fast and exactly as described!!  Packing was perfect and installation was simple.
B00FMOJZHS|4|Installed easy enough. Straight forward. I have noticed in just a month or so the black seems to be fading fast. My jeep isn't the cleanest but it is black and you can really see the fading. Makes it seem cheap. But works fine. No windshield washer. But I only have the Jack on when wheeling.
B000CPCC4U|5|Very tight tolerances use a block of wood like a piece of 2 x 4,and a good size hammer. Try putting some grease on both  surfaces. It has to go in Square and straight, once you get it started and it's going in straight you need to give it a couple of really good hard strikes before it seats, but they won't come off like other brands.
B00MQ4MYBQ|5|Exactly as pictured, prompt delivery
B000F6F99G|1|worked great for four months using supplied power adapter, then stopped working when plugged in.  Crazy but it works on battery once unplugged.  And of course there no luck finding customer support.  Otherwise the lights are plenty bright, but like other reviewers say, it is hard to adjust and should swivel more from side to side.
B007JN5HD6|3|it's okay a little small but will around it
B00KHUQ6L0|1|Just did not fit
B000F4D076|1|The plastic attachment broke the first time it was used.Nuf said!
B00B3XUBES|1|Followed directions and notice no difference. Waste of money.
B005BNP7SQ|1|I LOVE the way they look and work, when they work properly. This is my second exact hitch light from Reese I have bought in one year. They work just fine at first but later on the LED starts to flicker then only part of the light works.<br />The first light I bought had bad LEDs and water damage on the P. C Board the second one I bought I just tossed to the side. These would be excellent light if the workmanship was better and higher quality parts were used.
B004947SSU|5|Perfect factory fit! Works great
B005F3HMV2|5|Good quality.  Don't listen to reviews about size. I have a big head and fits very nicely.  Will buy more. Great buy
B003RVQI64|5|best price and exactly the same as a more expensive ones
B00CXGQKE4|3|Seem a bit cheep but will do. I'll Spend a bit more next time.
B008B5X5GC|5|Fixed the problem I was having with dash TPMS light.  Great price.
B003FPF22I|3|Pleased with them but I was thinking that they were going to be brighter, but overall I was satisfied
B00NWF8I5O|5|Works great would never know it wasn't the one that came with the truck! Good product, arrived quickly and without incident.
B000Z0HVHA|4|Works well!!
B000CQOIT6|5|just as described. great price
B00NPD6JMW|2|CHAIN AND REAR SPROCKET INSTALL AND WORK FINE, BUT FRONT SPROCKET WAS NOT MACHINED CORRECTLY.  THE THREADED HOLES FOR RETAINER ARE NOT IN THE PROPER LOCATION AND ALLOWS THE SPROCKET AND RETAINER TO SLIDE ON THE SHAFT.  I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER FRONT SPROCKET TO CORRECT IT.  IF YOU BUY THIS, GO AHEAD AND BUY A 'SUN' FRONT SPROCKET FOR ANOTHER $15 TO GO WITH IT.
B00VS0T7IC|5|Great tire gauge.  The swivel head is very handy and the ability to hold the pressure until using the integrated bleed button is so handy.  I previously purchased the same gauge with the  flexible 11-inch hose which is also a great gauge. There are times that the gauge without the hose is more handy.  Get both ... you will use them more frequently because of the ease of use and knowing they are accurate.  No more wondering if the reading is accurate or not.
B000CHGIDO|4|The hose is slightly not the right shape as the OEM on my 04 Subaru WRX.  As another reviewer noted, it creates a small kink on the rad side of the hose.  If you twist the pump side you can get to a point where it shouldn't be an issue.  One star off.
B0002JMF98|5|Very good
B00KXOUXCS|4|Good
B00753S8CC|5|Bought it as a gift for my boyfriend. He loved it
B00A6AS6LY|5|Worked fantastic...
B00KTNO1WQ|5|Kinda bulky so it was hard to find a spot for them inside my Jeep JK doors but I got it to work.  That's by far the hardest part.  Everything works great.  Super impressed with the range of remotes and power of the actuaters.  Remotes feel well built.  Comes with enough wire for everything.  They are even paired for you so not much instruction is needed.  And for $18. If they break in a year I'll buy another if I have to.  Great product for the price.
B007DKQGQC|5|OK
B00F2NHVX4|5|Excellent Quality.. Fits perfect into a new unused Kelly-Moore paint bucket, priced similar to big box stores junk, but made much stronger!
B001C9QX8Q|5|Ordered all four shocks/struts from Warehouse deals, installed on a 2007 Mazda 3, and have driven for over 1 year. Excellent. Would do this again without thinking.
B001UL7STE|5|Bravo! Love these things, quality is on point!
B003V3GBBU|3|Nice shape and well made but leather looks like plastic. However okay for price. Gave prompt delivery so would be happy to use this seller again. Looking for leather tool roll, tank cover and seat bag to match.....
B007ZODMQS|5|Replacement was Exact fit in engine exhaust. Cleared up O2 sensor issue
B000IYSKE6|5|Great quality
B002FYS2DG|3|Like the tail lights
B000Q9GFB8|4|Like them a lot. Wish they sold in CLEAR & DARK LENSES.
B001SIFIW8|5|Being used to secure the trunk lid on my rally car.  Does exactly what it is supposed to.
B00UWEOCR6|5|All i have to say is wow, these LED's gave my car a while new look, they're way brighter that the old halogen bulbs i had.
B00PBCL2HC|5|Great product looks as good if not better than the original thank you
B004JKK8Y0|1|The quality is very bad.  It does not fit Nissan Versa as advertised.  I ordered black and the material came with a shadows because the low quality it cannot resist summer weather.
B005ESZVXO|1|Do not buy. I ordered these left and right sway bar links for my 2004 Honda Civic EX and they were not identical; One looked like a generic version of OEM and the other looked like the Moog one in the picture (which it clearly wasn't moog). After a month the rubber came off and exposed the joints to the elements. Buy something else.
B002VH6NC4|5|bought this belt for my 08 335i, more quiet than the stock version and easy installation
B00UTWWELC|5|Good price and good stuff!
B00BPDCSPG|5|Incredibly good product and top notch construction.  Very happy with ease of installation and look on my motorcycle.
B000CL9NI2|3|It's okay, it works and is cooling fine. But I do know it's a bit of a gamble. Having been in the retail parts business for over 17yrs and knowing the Four Seasons name, I was a little disappointed when I open the box. didn't see the normal Four Season Stickers label or warnings. Plus this was a customer return after attempted installation. Greasy finger prints on caution tape and the fact that the tape was broken on both ports where lines connect told me this was a customer return. The box was completely covered in tape to hide the fact this was not what was pictured or described to be. It was the correct fitting compressor, just not the high standard Four Seasons item I was expecting. Don't get me wrong there are many rebuilders that are competent, I'm just sold on Four Seasons standards from experience. Electrical connection was correct so not a big deal. it's been in the truck for a few months now and doing fine. Just with the tape broken I wasn't sure what the previous installer did and if correct amount of pag oil was still in compressor prior to installation. If it were my truck it wouldn't be such an issue, but this was installed on a customers truck so now I'm warranting and item I'm not completely comfortable with, but we'll see if it's all worry for nothing. Thanks Amazon for your service. Yes this was to be a Four Seasons Reman unit, but sold by a third company, not Four Seasons.
B000GZLVCK|5|Seem like quality bars
B00KTIZPF8|5|the letter wore off my old remote.  This was a perfect replacement. easier to see in my purse than the old black on. I<br />followed the Chevy programming instructions and the remote works great.
B002VVOF02|5|Exceptional quality brake pads.  Easy install, quiet positive stopping power.  Great price too.  Hopefully they will last at least as long as the original pads I changed out.
B000GU0XRO|5|this does just what it is intended to do. Someone complained about it sliding sideways when he rotated the wheel, with proper positioning this does not happen.
B00E6TXWV0|5|This works extremely well when used with my snap on Snap On PH3050 air hammer.  I not only use it on bleeders, but I put the Philips socket from my hand impact on it to remove frozen rotor screws.  I would reccomend this to others.<br /><br />Chris
B00062Z3PE|5|My 2000 Dodge Dakota has an AIRAID aftermarket cold intake tube but the previous owner used a bigger and longer filter. So I decided to use something smaller and I decided to go with this filter. The opening for the intake tube to go in is 3.5 inches and it fit in perfect. My truck had a K&N prior to this one that I bought, but still I could tell how it breathed better, better throttle response, and you also get that cool air sucking sound. I don't have a way to measure the horsepower and torque gains, but I am sure I have at least gained a few horses. I don't know how accurate it is, but I looked on K&N's site and I saw something like 11hp gain at something like 4500RPM.... anyways you will gain with these K&N filters!<br /><br />If you don't know, once the filter gets dirty, you can buy the charging kit for under $20 and clean, dry, lube, let set and use again. I recommend you get two so when you service one, you can install the other one so you don't have to wait.... if you do't have a filter you can't drive your vehicle ;)
B00ZLPABGC|5|great
B00IY2CM5M|5|Fit perfect should last another 100,000 miles
B00J4TW6ZA|5|Good scooter.
B00312B5YO|5|Very good quality product, easy to install. Looks great!
B000CONMYA|5|It looks great and was easy to install.  Exactly what I expected.  I recommend to everyone.  Nice to be able to put things in the bed out of sight and out of weather but still be able to roll it up and haul a load when needed!
B005J5D03K|5|works perfect
B001GJ3EJS|2|I bought these to clean the wheels of my car.  After one use, they are pretty shot.  I was able to get into the larger areas, but I resorted to a toothbrush on the small grooves.  For a one time use, not bad, but don't expect more.
B003UWQFKY|5|This wax competes with some of the more expensive carnauba waxs and comes very very close. it gives vehicles amazing shine, depth and the waterbeading is second to none.
B007OXCIMY|5|Put it on my dyna wide glide 2 years ago still working like a champ.
B00JWG31KY|2|Lights are super bright but came shipped with chipped paint coming off of them on the housing not even going to bother to send them back
B00H5F2RVI|4|Valve caps work as valve caps, not bad.
B00TEF4ZZI|5|great decal that lasts long.
B00496GUC8|5|Awesome price, good quality and fit. Will definitely keep buying these.
B007X5J8R6|5|the part worked perfectly
B00HTOB0NG|5|Worked
B001FCB4JS|5|saved time and alot of effort and was easy to apply
B000I8TPFU|4|It does the job.  The magnet design could be a little better to help hold the heater against the block a little tighter, I think the heat transfer would work more efficiently if it did.<br /><br />Keep in mind 200 watts isn't much - this is for small engines like a mower or very small tractor.  I bought this for my Jinma 35hp tractor and it doesn't do much at all - but works great on my 17hp riding mower.
B0006SU3QW|5|I bought this to recolor the interior of my car, unsure of what I needed to actually do the job. Then unsure of what to expect coming out of the can, I tested a few sprays of this on an ordinary plastic bottle, figuring plastic has to be one of the harder surfaces to adhere to. The end effect was beautiful! Great coverage in only two coats (on the actual door), moderate odor, dries very fast regardless of the heat or cold (I ended up doing this in the cold at 38F outside)and dries looking like actual vinyl.<br /><br />After the surface was dried, I decided to test the dried result: scratching it with my nails, with sandpaper and the scrub side of a kitchen sponge, and the paint stands up extremely well! Yes, with enough elbow grease in scrubbing the sprayed WILL pull apart, but that's more than everyday wear and tear on a car door will ever apply.<br /><br />One car door done, definitely ordering more for the rest! Much better than I thought it would be.
B0046ID5EK|1|Not a good item.it stoped working after 2 days only .do not buy this remote .
B002G38WLI|3|Performance Quality was never as good as the stock Mercedes blades however  Same brand as stock part. Same quality. Box had Mercedes brand logo on it.
B002CWMYQW|5|Gives you that race fuel smell out of pump gas.
B000K02EDG|5|Works great!!

B00GR9FOQ8|5|Works great.
B00ONHHCAM|1|Not good
B0064EARPE|5|Great
B00UV07AGG|5|I wrote another longer review explaining in detail this product and step by step installation. It was not allowed. This is a cool product. I can highly recommend this product. I spent about 5 minutes per door on installation.  *Update* I liked them so much I added one at the license plate frame.
B000FPZSOS|5|Thick rubber to give long life.and withstand normal operating temperature.
B00PJPHEBO|5|This product is GREAT! I've used it on several vehicles to check and reset engine codes but I usually leave it plugged into my Kia Soul which has a Pure Android Huifei radio in it. This radio is known for not pairing with everything yet this adapter paired right up and now I use it with Torque Pro to have real time engine telemetry anytime I want through the radio! This is an amazing product that is well worth the price!
B0059HJZO6|5|Grease is grease. Seems to be filled to the top, unlike others. No air pockets.
B000H961YI|5|NICE COMPACT BATTERY CHARGER
B002IV8KR4|5|good to have
B007D83WMU|3|I purchased this to hold my 38oz HydroFlask.  It definitely has to be weighed down or it will fallout of the cup holder.  The Hydroflask sits in the top ring area and can be wobbly, or stuck inside the cup holder.  We tried 3 different types and this was the best of the worst.
B005QZKDAQ|5|Perfect fit, powder coated,
B005WWO7YQ|5|Running this in my 33 foot RV running a 460 gas engine,  on a good day in the summer time I get 5.1 miles to the gallon. when I added the archoil my mileage immediately jumped to 5.7 mpg.  I then take a trip to the mountains with more of the archoil and it's still continued to perform very well I got 5.6 miles to the gallon and also the power seem to be much better as I climbed into the mountains.<br /><br /> I will have to say it increased the performance on my gas burning engine significantly and if I can Improve 1/2 mpg it will not take long to pay for  itself in my gas running RV much less my 6.0 powerstroke Ford.
B001C4SL4U|5|Just what I needed for my 2013 Mini Cooper Roadster.
B00D42AFS8|5|This just saved our lives!  Well, in a convenience sense...but I could see it also saving our lives in a literal sense. So glad we have this product!
B00RDMBTNA|5|We r actually using these as dust mitts. I've let the kids run with the house with these. They don't even know there cleaning
B0049EVSTK|5|Good quality and easy install.
B00157TGXY|5|I received the product on time in perfect condition.  I have used this product for several years for my basement toilet and holding tank.  You can put the packets in the toilet tank or the holding tank.  I put it in my toilet tank.  Has a pleasant smell and works great.  Great Job!
B00MQGO0S4|5|Wife thought these were funny. installed on dash of our new side by side.
B001GH5PWY|5|Perfect match to the Rugged Ridge 17235.58 Black Left Side A-Pillar 4-Switch Pod!  Matches the instrument panel in my Jeep!

B0007LZK9I|5|works great
B00TY78DP4|4|Love this blanket for me steering wheel.  Soft but could've use a little more softer. It doesn't wrap all the way around more on my 2016 Mazda CX-6 steering wheel.
B000C2WF0E|4|muy buen producto
B00F5MUB66|5|Works great and easy to install.
B0035B0G5K|5|Bought two other very expensive sets of bar ends that did not fit right, so when I found these I was skeptical bc of the price. These fit perfect and work very well. Reduced vibration significantly and they look nice too. VERY GOOD PRODUCTS from lucky bike!!
B007XZK99M|5|This is a nice addition to my 97 mustang. Works like a charm. I will say that it did not perfect by itself i did have to cut just a little off of the pipe that connects to the throttle bobby but it was a simple procedure as long as u have the tools and the know how. Great product! I would buy again.
B005NLQAHS|1|This device requires an Android application to work.  There is one that is free and a &#34;Pro&#34; version that costs $4.95.  The problem with both is that they collect your personal information, including device ID, call info, location and access to your pictures and media files.  Too many requirements for an application that just displays data collected from your car.
B0042I56L4|1|Broken when received. Cheap quality.
B00BKV6624|5|Good quality windshield
B0007LVJ2A|5|Well made. Easy to use. A must have if you don't want your hitch stolen!
B000FQ1J40|5|Used these to mount my doors to a 2x4 in my garage for storage in the summer.  They work perfectly.

B00CQ40KVM|5|good quality..perfect
B007USCM7E|5|Easy to use, great result
B007CVGBRQ|5|Excellent product !<br />Solid!!!!!!!
B005G9WM2O|5|This winch works great.  I have been  using it to move some pretty big rocks into place building rock walls
B00KAEK0DS|2|Decent sticker. It's a little thin and is not the thick  vinyl you'd expect. One corner keeps lifting after only a month after purchasing.
B000C9S43O|5|Smooth factory ride. Just as it should be.
B003V5EU5W|5|I Am Very Pleased With The Arrival Time Of The Nissan Logo&It Fits My 2015 Nissan Perfectly!!!
B0030FMV5Y|5|NICE SAFETY GLasses!
B00F5827DK|3|Great for level ground like a cement pad or paved spot. Didn't care for them on the ground. It was hot and the gave a bit from the heat. Also the could be bigger.
B000UK9DUS|5|Best wheel bearing set ever
B008H2PL9S|5|Seems to be doing it's job keeping the ATF in the pan on a 2005 T&C!
B004HUGGWK|5|Fit perfect. Easy to put on. Loved the new seat.
B001CEG90I|5|This is simple to change on my 4Runner. Open glove box, open cover, slide out, replace. Dealership wants $90. Do it yourself and save.
B000CFNORY|4|Its great
B004BV06ZI|5|the batteries fit perfectly and my ups is back up and running.
B000AA4RWM|1|you cant get the tape pealed off the back.  I wouldn't buy this product again.
B00SH1N1A0|3|Mirrors look good on bike, BUT, hard to see out of and adjust.  Really have a hard time getting them to stay tight - I'm going back to stock mirrors....
B004C444RA|3|The gloves tore very easily. Good quality leather however.
B007Y86EYM|5|Perfect fit for my '03 Expedition. Fast shipping. Would definitely buy from DB Electrical again!
B00APL7O4Y|1|Put on car. One broke two of the spokes. When it was put on car. The other went rolling down the road. When i stopped at a red light. And was assembled and put on car the correct way.
B009OBVS20|5|I had a chance to put it to the test today with a scratch from rear to front on my car. It did not work first because scratch was too deep, I had to wet sand it with a 2000 sand paper and then polish. Results are shown on pictures, a pro result. Followed by polish and liquid wax
B001GMX9FO|4|This was great made a difficult job very easy. had it installed in minutes. the instructions were lack luster but after I looked at it it was intuitive.
B000Q2FAOS|3|Thought it would be easier to use than a liquid formula and this mitt does make it easier. However, after following directions to a tee, windshield had a major glare, especially visible in the sun. Multiple wipings with a wet and dry cotton cloth later the glare was reduced but not gone.
B00579A58G|5|Worked great.James Wilson
B008427D88|5|Worked for me.
B00GRHRTEU|4|Great order showed up when it was expected. Took little effort to put on. Works great!
B00032KBFE|4|They did the job!
B00F4M3WN6|5|Great cover for my C5 Convertible. Peace of mind knowing its dust and ding free when covered
B002N5JAO2|2|Luckily I bought something else to go over top. Need to edit your instructions to tell your customers they have around 30 secs to get the stuff on or you will burn your hands off. 70% of product lost.  Not viscous at all, so unless you are placing it with gravity in your favor expect it to drip back with the consistency of very thin honey for those first 30 seconds.  When this drips on your arm you need something close by to wash off.  By the time you wash off everything else will harden and you can go ahead throw the rest away.  Use the little cloth that came with it to wipe your tears.
B00JEXODKW|5|Great lights for the money.  I just recieved them and temporarily put in my car.  The only negative side so far is the fact that the wires are so short<br /><br />Video<br />https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QoIuKgxbEfU&feature=youtu.be
B001QKVGBU|5|EZ install and very bright
B002UBZKA2|5|Fit was great and worked like a charm!
B0006303CG|1|Chrome peeling off after 2 weeks.
B006QLN9F0|5|If you have a Ford truck and the front grill logo is played out from mileage, this is the item for you.  Installation was very quick and easy.  This is exactly like the original.
B00AZJYDQI|1|Am I full of hot air or not? Wow what can I say. this thing just doesn't seal very well and doesn't seem to fit most of the tire valves I have. Now you might ask, How many could I possibly use this on, you ask? I run as many as 10 dump trailers everyday and the tires on my truck. I check each and every tire every time before I move or haul a trailer. Each trailer has four tires so you do the math. I use the all metal tire valves because the rubber eventually leak after many checks. This inflator valve leaks so much air I have to push hard to get air in the tire, it's so bad I ordered two others brands different from each other from Amazon to find another inflator valve that actually works. Sloppy fit and doesn't stay on. Not worth the scrap weight of the brass. One Star for is for Amazon, zero stars for this little stinker.
B00WL4JDFG|5|Love this decal! Was looking for something to really set my Jetta apart and this is it. It came surprisingly early for shipping out of the U.S. Instructions were pretty basic and the easy to figure out. Vary easy to apply. Just line it up using masking tape making sure you get it where you want it. Wet the surface is the car, peel the backing off and apply using a squeegee to push out the water and air from the decal. Once it's on its on and you're all set. Well made product.
B00A2A1RFK|1|It did not work
B002MQ8NB8|5|nice helmet have owned VEGA helmets before  nice products like and need the air vents for ventilation on my head
B004GEO9CG|5|The part was perfect ! And very easy to install !<br />We are SO glad that we didn't pay the dealership $315 to do it !!!<br />I was very pleased with the whole ease of my order !!
B002GIL64I|1|This spout is terrible!<br />The black cap cracks easily.<br />The thin rubber seal that is supposed to seal the spout tight tears easily so it leaks without it.<br />The spout itself will take you 20 minutes to pour 5 gallons of gas from the container - veeeerrrry sloooooow!!!<br />I bought myself a funnel, and pour gas from the gas can without using the lousy spout.  I just need to find good seal caps without spouts to seal the cans for transport now and throw these spouts away!
B00G9AKNBG|5|Inexpensive, OEM rubber wiper inserts that are easy to install. Easier to get them on Amazon than driving to the local Honda dealership, plus no tax and two-day shipping (on Prime). I change all three inserts every 6-12 months.
B008MCEZ2M|1|It did not fit my 99 Corolla
B007P73UX0|4|Fit like it should
B0064NSJVE|1|These do not fix a 2015 Toyota 4 runner LIMITED model. The rear pair fits, but the front pair do not. The website is misleading. 1 star at best
B00N5F514M|2|Extremely disappointed.  I have a Subaru Forester.  Definitely a few inches shorter in length than the description.  Very thin and flimsy.  My visors were not able to hold it to the windshield.  Had to cut it to 'fit' around the rearview mirror.  Did not seem to cool the truck at all.  Not bothering to return it since it's so cheap but will be looking for something else.
B00DIYGMLG|5|Wish I had this year's ago.  Noticeable difference than with disconnects. More control.  Best thing to use on northwest off camber trails. Easy install. I have mine on the lightest setting and no noticeable body roll street driving with good gas shocks. Mine are bilstein.
B00CKZM0YM|5|My hubby loved this
B0000AY3X8|4|Good
B00Z5HWWXG|3|They do fit H6M sockets, they are LED and they produce white light and have low current draw.<br />They might be three time as bright as a 5W halogen light bulb. They DO NOT compare in brightness with a stock 25/25w ATV headlight, (Yamaha 350 Grizzly). These LED bulbs no not work well with the light reflector designed for incandescent bulbs, no focused beam. I went for a short night ride using only these lights. Don't ride in a cow pasture with only these lights because you will never see what will be spattered all over your machine<br />They are low current drain --VERY LOW. High beam draws 390ma @ 12V (4.7Watts), Low beam draws 130ma @ 12V (1.6watts)<br />They will work perfectly in my setup which is two 18 watt 30º LED spot lights connected in parallel with the stock high beams and two 18 watt 60º LED flood lights in parallel with the low beam. Instead of 25/25W incandescent head lights I will have 23/20W LED head lights on my ATV snowplow, at about triple the lumens.<br />They would not be good direct replacement for stock bulbs, but for lowering current draw so you can triple the light output on your ATV at the same current draw they are perfect.
B00681BDXI|5|Was delivered quick, works great. It was easy to program for my car.
B00BUV2W3G|5|This was very easy to install on my 2013 Camry SE. It looks impressive and gives my car a distinctive look.
B00KTHY2DA|5|It is a great replacement and works perfectly.
B008MQ4XFW|5|Nice look for the hitch. We really like it. We purchased the Nissan one and it looks so nice.
B001EMDSP2|5|No instructions but you don't even have to weld and quick put on and sounds nice!
B00Y7ZNDSA|5|Fit just rite on my 06 Commander.
B01015F2UQ|5|Perfect fit. Looks great.
B004JB5XGM|5|Worked great
B004KGEE5W|5|Proud to fight like a girl against breast cancer.....both my own as well as others;.....
B006FINVQ6|5|So far so good.  Look great and the color and brightness are right on.
B00DSD4J1M|5|I haven't put it on my car yet since I have yet to clean it, but its exactly as specified.
B000CPI5XW|5|love it
B00KTHQR0Q|5|Great product and easy online programming instructions.  Worked perfectly for my 2005 Dodge Ram.
B00SZK109C|1|Love these lights but did not expect the blue to look like cop blue. I can never run them because I'll get pulled over
B007VT5R2Y|5|love it
B00DO04MTS|5|Fits and looks great in my 2015 RAV4 XLE. Easy to install and very secure once installed. I think they could have cut a little better around the gas cap door release lever but that's just a minor detail and does not interfere with operating the release. I originally ordered the grey color to match my two-stone grey/ash interior but found the grey to be too light and returned it for the black mats which look much better.
B00BCV03L2|1|Used gloves and damaged, Doesn't list condition of glove on page but never thought i was getting used gloves.
B003WDDLTO|2|Mine burned up was trying to jump the bike. Just to much power going through toss little cables. Otherwise I guess it did all right.
B00SA25KWI|4|Looks good on my car, gave it a new sporty look, I've had my car over 100 mph and this piece of plastic stayed on nice and snug
B003FWVY6O|5|This is an awesome rug its a good rug for any part of your house!!
B001PWFPE8|3|it's okay, if there is a way to slow the tailgate down a little slower it wound be a very great item to purchase.
B000NECLQE|5|Genuine one with high quality.
B000R308RA|1|After 4 months, some of the LED's have went out or blown. I WOULDN'NT recommend this product at all. Please, if you read my review on this product don't waste your hard earned money on it! Look at some of the other products and avoid this one all together!
B008OX06O0|3|like the camo but the Velcro provided with mat doesnt stick very well to dash even after cleaned recommend stronger velcro..
B00SZZKU02|5|Our son had problems with his scooter. We ordered this performance kit to help him solve the problem. After arrival, our son took only a few minutes to install it and now the scooter is back on road. I love this kit.
B008LMO7Y4|5|Will buy again when this one gets stolen or torn. Its wicked cool.
B001DRN9LG|2|internal piston assembly is all plastic.  Toyota OEM is brass.  Plus, when trying to install this, the 10mm bolt is almost impossible to get a wrench on, thanks to poor engineering.  Cocked one of the pistons trying to compress it, and then the whole thing was useless.  Never again.
B00IZ8NL0A|3|mushroom head
B00IACGFOA|5|Great surge protector. It does what it is designed to do.<br /><br />I've only had it a couple of months, so I'll have to see as time goes on.
B00C6MSG60|5|Will continue to buy it next time.
B0066SMMBA|5|Just as described, Thanks !
B00SCXCQV8|5|Mounted these onto my hustler mower. Lights up the path ahead very nicely.
B001R5ORBK|5|I have a nissan altima 2.5sl 2003 will this be for my car also?
B00V30J86I|1|too small, can't get anything in it
B001OZW8PK|5|I've had this coil for quite a while. It's definitely an improvement over the stock coil. The difference was like night and day. The only issue I've had is that the motor tends to burn through a set of spark plugs every 3-4 months now. That's probably a result of everything being made in China these days.
B006P884N6|5|do you want skeleton hands cupping your breast? THEN THESE ARE THE PATCHES FOR YOU!
B00144AHGI|5|The dust cap fell off of my '91coleman Roanoke royal pop-up so I ordered this. It arrived promptly and with some firm persuasion (hammer and block of wood) the cap fit snug. And now I have an extra cap.
B000C7VXWU|5|In service for a couple of years now...works fine. Exact fit.
B008X6QS90|5|Awesome SMD LEDs. They are very small so soldering them could be a challenge.
B001C6LG3Q|4|Said it would be 2 stage pump but i got it and says rotory pump But other then that works grear
B00O4U0MXC|4|I thought this would securely hold my sockets in place, but that is not the case. Don't get me wrong, it works great for socket storage and organization in your garage or cabinet, just not for mobile bag. The sockets are loose when you place them in. If you turn the rail upside down the socket will fall out. I was looking for something that would hold the sockets in place so I wouldn't have a mess in my mobile tool bag.
B009GIG5O2|1|Bulb bursted as I was trying to install it
B006B22M20|5|eVERY THINK WAS OK
B008G5AA7E|5|These were a great fit.  Took about 30 minutes to install.  Delivery was fast.
B00HJ6O4A0|5|amazing colors, practical, light weight, easy to clean just shake it and the sand comes off, comfortable and big size
B00E5OUOCQ|3|I like that it's easy to fold up and it's just one piece but for the price it's made of thin material and thin wire. Once this breaks I'll probably just go buy the accordion type shade again.
B00WBBKQ6Y|4|LOOK GOOD , LOW PRICE , A GREAT COSMETIC ADDITION TO YOUR HONDA .<br />THIS IS THE THIRD SET OF AFTER MARKET  WHEEL CENTER HUB CAPS THAT I HAVE PURCHASED OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS.<br />THE REASON FOR REPLACING THEM EVERY YEAR IS THAT UNDER THE VERY INTENSE FLORIDA SUN , THE  BRIGHT RED COLOR STARTS TO FADE AFTER 6 TO 7 MONTHS. AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THE LAST SET PURCHASED THE GLUE LOST ITS GRIP & TWO OF THEM FELL OFF. TO CORRECT THE GRIP PROBLEM I SUGGEST A SMALL TOUCH OF SUPER GLUE BE APPLIED TO THE OUTER EDGE OF EMBLEM WHERE IT MAKES CONTACT WITH THE WHEEL<br />EVEN THOUGH THIS ITEM IS LESS THAN PERFECT , I WILL CONTINUE TO USE THEM , DUE TO THEIR GOOD LOOKS & LOW PRICE.
B00YVQD4A2|5|Performs as expected. Perfect size!
B0073I3ON2|4|nice and clear, one downside no bulbs installed.
B00KLELVB2|5|Very happy with it. Works extremely well, easy to install and small. Came to my front door in perfect time
B000Z552SK|5|Very good.
B000CP86WW|2|Not what I expected
B004W5U4SW|5|Fits perfect, easy to install, great price.
B0002SR4Q8|3|Found the product kind of flimsy at the spring area, and it also didn't want to grab the filter well. It did work though, so giving it a 3 star. Price is very high compared to the Fram I saw at Walmart, and the product looked identical.
B00OMB4IFQ|1|This thing is junk, it came it it was nice and shiny and everything and then I started having problems. I got this bike on June 19th and never received a title for it until July 27th. It was ridiculous the woman who deals with the titles wouldn't even talk with me, she only sent emails. and when I called customer service all they did was tell me to send emails. FamilyGoKart has terrible customer service. I took 3 pictures of one part that was leaking gas. You can obviously identify the part and how small the hoses coming off from it are. Then i received a different part that has more hoses coming off from it that goes on a different side of the bike then i specified and now its Aug 7th and i still can't ride a bike I bought in June. Ant to send it back because its not worth the savings I have to pay a $300 restocking fee as agreed to in the contract. There are no prompt replies with customer service and apparently no one down there knows how to order parts because the only reply i ever get is oh so and so does this and they won't be in till Monday. well its Friday and I wouldn't mind being able to ride my bike this weekend if someone could communicate with me. When I got the bike there were parts not mounted, Overall I thought I was buying a bike that would need a little general work for the savings, and got a bike that you can't do anything with but work on it. If you want to waste your money and time constantly working on a bike and not riding one then this is the bike for you. If you want to ride and not worry about constantly fixing dumb problems then you should get a different bike just like I plan to do.
B005R205YM|5|Great item,great service
B00CNUUU5A|4|I really like the functionality. This one replaced one I had made. I had only one problem. There was a large weld seam in the receiver tube. I couldn't get the ball mount to slide in. I ground and filed the seam out and it now works fine. This could have been a problem if I did not have equipment to re-work it.
B0089LT9WW|5|it's for my 2008 Honda Pilot SE. Nothing is fitting better than original part.
B00MLAUYDK|1|Fell apart after opening / trying to close the first time.
B008X61ZXY|4|muy buen producto
B000F15GBM|4|good fit ,looks good wish I could have gotten a darker gray, other than that very happy with dashmat product
B003ZS7232|1|WARNING: This DOES NOT fit a Toyota Sienna 2015 Limited Premium. I ordered this model using information provided by the &#34;This fits your car&#34; tool at the top of the page. While the tool said this fits a 2015 Toyota Sienna with the Limited Trim, I can tell you it does not. If someone else states that it does by FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE, then I must have been sent an incorrect device (even though it is labeled properly) or they used a different part.  Why it does not fit: The adapter jacks for the taillights are the incorrect fitting. They do not slide into the jacks. One jack even has 3 pins in an L formation but the adapter jacks are all horizontal in a line.  My 1 star rating is based on Amazons &#34;This fits your car&#34; tool, and not really the product ordered since I obviously cannot test the product properly.  Unfortunately, I needed this installed and ready tomorrow morning since I have to use my utility trailer to pick up some bulky items two states away. I love Amazon, I really do, but due to several issues with recent orders, I am really doubting the benefits of the Prime membership I have had for over 5 years.
B007KTINWQ|5|This spray wax is excellent. It can be applied to every part of the car including the trim, glass & chrome. After application, the black trim looks clean and detailed-no need for trim dressing. In fact, the whole car looks this way and beads water like crazy, making for easy car washings. Note: If you run across any streaking, grab a clean side of your towel & buff it with medium pressure. This will eliminate the extra wax left behind, resulting in a perfect shine. For now on, I will leave the paste wax on the shelf & stick with Ice spray wax.
B00LTFZBOU|5|Very nice replacement
B0087XOTWW|5|Just installed in RV. Not sure how well we will like them until next trip !
B00DPRSYKS|5|Looks awesome
B006K8VIAM|3|Just 3 stars because I received the grease inside of a cardboard type container with a pop on lid, not a plastic container with a screw on lid as it shows in the picture. To make things worse, there was a large dent into the top metal of the container where it was dropped onto something so once you open the sealed container, the plastic pop on lid doesn't fully seat down and close on the container. So I have to use a piece of duct tape across the lid to bend it down to keep it sealed and keep from having the grease fly out if I dropped it or I had to carry it somewhere inside of a tool bag. I'm sure the grease itself will be great and work well, though.
B004GCRLJG|2|Order was placed in March 29, 2015 and had it installed by early April.  The cord to the motor snapped just last week.  Didn't even last 6 months.  Looking at the highly rated Dorman brand this time.  I guess you get what you paid for.
B004ME8MZ0|5|Perfect fit.  Simple to install and remove.  Sharp looking.
B0050OKIMG|5|Looks good
B00VU8GBQI|5|You can take off and move if you don't get right the first time. It doesn't leave residue. Very nice where ridding two up.
B000C2AP88|5|Have used Fel-Pro products for years working as a mechanic, best choice if you want to seal it right the first time.
B000CIJM2M|3|Good material, solid product, has some weight to it.  Like the brushed finish (this is not chrome), but is a bit large for the OEM or aftermarket opening for the bow tie on the grill. You have to sand the grill down in order for it to fit. If you are looking for something that fits without adjustments, other than an original bow tie, you may not find anything. Looked for weeks. This is as close as any I found.
B007Q92GT6|2|the inside pockets for the cds are made of thin paper and tear
B00ZUZ6YDC|5|I love having this in my car, just in case. The holder is nice because you could mount it anywhere in your car so it can easily be grabbed in an emergency. It feels very strong and sturdy. The razor part looks sharp. This is a great just in case tool! Don't wait until it's too late to buy this. I need another one for our other car. I received this product at a discount for an honest unbiased review.
B004I0FCWO|5|Fit my 98 Altima GXE just like the original part. Seems fairly sturdy. I'll edit the review if I notice any problems down the road since I just installed it but it looks good.
B00IZNZOYQ|5|works as designed. a must have for late model toyota filters.  I use on sienna vans for fleet maintenance
B00TT21EQO|5|Great
B00VXFKGE6|5|They have performed as they were advertised. I am completely satisfied.
B00EA0ZB7I|5|Put them on my golf cart ,awesome!
B00OCU6VNO|2|'Italian made' was the main reason to select this umbrella, expecting higher quality and /or standout design features. There is none, the product is very ordinary. I had to return it because weirdly toll stand makes the umbella impractical, and top looks out of proportion.
B000CMD76A|5|This was exactly what I needed. Excellent product and timely service.
B005MVBE1G|5|Perfect fit. Easy to install
B00GMRM3KA|5|AWESOME.. ENOUGH SAID.
B00KOD8W7Q|5|Perfect. Even arrived early
B000IY4AKE|5|After 8 years, 160,000 miles, &#34;discussions&#34; with Honda, warranty replacements and thousands of dollars poured into my dealer's vacation fund, I absolutely LOVE these Centric rotors.  They are smooth as &#34;buttah,&#34; and my wife finally has absolutely zero complaints about the brakes.  It took Honda 7 years to quietly admit that the original parts had some issues - see Parts Information Bulletin A14-008.
B00W4XNQ16|4|These Mehr red and black braided key chains are of very high quality. They are tightly braided and very durable. I tried to pull them apart but they did not budge. The feature of 2 key rings is pretty awesome. It prevents mixup of keys.for example car keys and home keys or home keys and work keys. You no longer will have to search for an extr key ring to attach to the main one! It's already done for you! The bright colors allow for easy find of your keys, because if you're like me then you constantly misplace the keys haha! The metal is high quality as well. The only downfall is that it is hard to fit around your wrist and I wish it was a little longer. Otherwise, these are great!! I purchased these keychain for review during a promotional period. The statements reflected above are my own honest and unbiased opinions based off of my experience and use with the product.
B0009IQZPW|5|These are very nice foam applicators
B003MNIKG8|5|It's the only thing you need to keep things in place.
B00OZQ5HWQ|1|Followed directions completely and trim still came loose. Not a good purchase.
B004CJ4IQC|2|The ventshade looks like it will work, but you must send the correct parts for attaching it to the hood of the vehicle.  Now I must come up with a solution to make it work.  Get it right the first time!
B008APL7N6|4|Nice quality stickers
B000C16XL2|4|Did everything per spec, much faster than stock, hopefully I will never need another one of these but if I do I know what, where and when.
B008427D88|5|They fit the bottom engine covers for the 2006 Lancer.
B00A8VYAES|5|Works like the original. We had a car where  the doors locks  were not being opened  by the remote. Initial diagnosis pointed to this actuator unit.  We  replaced it and now the remote door lock works perfectly.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Awesome
B00D3R1QFA|5|Thank God, have not had to use it; but it is &#34;security&#34; if needed.
B004K9G4BQ|5|fits good
B0081H6DW8|5|good gasket set
B0024NWW9I|5|nice - brite. would buy again
B000W0RQ8C|1|Doesnt fit 2016 Ford Super Duty receiver.<br /><br />Looks nice and solid HOWEVER--i cant use it as it is too short to allow the lock to be placed on the pin. I'll now spend more money to get one a different lock that does work.  Trimax needs to relook at this design and Amazon needs to get more qualifying information on their site.
B011J16ZLG|5|I am happy with my recent purchase of the bikemaster TE4-0218 battery motorcycle charger and maintainer, it helps to keep my battery fully charged, if I don't ride my bike for a long period of time.
B001HLNJ9K|4|Fit as described. Shipped quick.
B000E81VN8|5|This thing is amazing! Doesn't move at all and the adjustable compartments are fantastic for things you're worried about shifting while driving. There was a slight smell when first opened, but a hew hours sitting in the garage cured that and it didn't overtake the garage. Nothing negative to say about it.
B00E9G0GYQ|5|Quick delivery. As advertised.
B00BGZ33MA|5|Very good product. Just like you would get at the dealership and pay 4 times as much for. Good quality and seems to be very durable.
B000I8YP1Y|5|Great price and quality
B010MNRLDS|4|Fit 1998 gmc sierra had a issue but seller fixed promptly and happy with product looks good
B00SSJA122|1|2nd one came allmost as damaged as first one. No protection used in mailing just train in envelope. Every other decal I ordered came sandwiched between 2 8x 5 index cards not this \\" sticckerlikes\\" they don't give a s***  I hope they go out of business they don't deserve our $$$$$$
B00XDI52B8|5|Solid metal, with a clean A.F. Logo. Exactly what I wanted.
B008AFYN6O|5|It was great
B00VGL6TSO|5|Good product . Exactly what I was looking for.
B00E9D4NES|5|These fit perfect for my 2014 chevy cruze. the back emblem is not really difficult to adhere because of the size. The front Bowtie can be challenging. I didnt want/couldnt use the wet method. so i did it free hand. Like said that back was no problem. MAKE sure the front bowtie &#34;sticker&#34; maches the exact bowtie on the car. I found out that the decal was upside down on the paper. once I turned it around it match up perfectly..THIS IS IMPORTANT. and who so many other had problems...because either way looking at it, it looks right but when you go to adhere it...you might have to turn it 180 degree's for the perfect fit. I have a black Cruze. It looks great!
B00BK85FAQ|5|Fits as expected.
B001IH8Q0A|5|great adapter for the cargo carrier I also bought... works very well
B00F0M5GMU|5|Nice quality, saved a fortune on the trimline upgrade to have running boards. Looks factory but no one else has these. Great Buy
B001NYR5QY|5|Good.
B005BNG1U4|2|Not enough padding
B00063XXSM|5|Factory tool works perfect.
B008FIVK30|5|Works great thanks!!
B000B8JUGQ|5|Fits perfectly and much larger spring than my stock 2004 Ford one.
B00V7NEPYG|1|I don't care how well they may or may not work, I feel seller is deceptice.  I asked, before purchase: &#34;Will these plug directly into my 2014 JK, or do I need a wiring adapter?&#34; You answered: A:  &#34;No.Just install directly.&#34; Why not clearly state that  your connector will not fit the existing JK harness, leaving you with the only option of splicing your connector into a perfectly good OEM harness. If this is what &#34;install directly&#34; means, I feel that you are deceptive. Where is the correct &#34;adapter&#34; I asked of, that allows me to truly &#34;just install directly&#34; into my JK?
B008XKPWWK|5|Very happy with our choice. Replacing and cheap model..( SOB -- some other brand ) with one highly recommended by fellow RVers !
B00ROSZ6MS|4|This mask was pretty cool, made some of my own alterations an had to cut it to fit my neck cause it was too big, which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5, other than that its great!
B00AMOBACQ|5|Badge is very nice high quality.
B00GUCYA9E|5|Excellent cover
B00XVZYTLM|5|Highly recommend all my bulbs worked and are very bright.
B001EP2904|2|Fits really loose.  Had to wrap tape around it so it would not fall out of my curt tow hitch.
B00WA4AMYS|5|Heavy Duty, very good quality, fit the Prius Two perfectly. I bought my first floor mat from the dealer (deferent brand) this one is way better then the one you get from the dealer. Very good materials and hold to the floor very well not like my other one. I highly recommend it for everyone who wanna take care of his Prius.
B0027FYBNI|5|Takes the smell of smoke & other odors out of the car. Easy to use. Smells fresh. Only complaint is that you'll have to wash the inside windows due to the fog.
B001B58XCA|5|So far so good. I mounted this on my 91 Nissan Pathfinder with a VG30 V6 that a did a manual 5 speed swap on. No issues so far. Drives nice. No clutch chatter or slipping. The only thing I can complain about is the extremely tight fitment of the pilot tool in the pilot bushing. However it did work and all is good.
B00P87ZEEC|5|My 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid finally had a light go out and I needed to replace it.  I used Amazon to find the part for my vehicle using their vehicle parts identification program and this bulb came up as the recommended one for my vehicle.  I ordered it and when it arrived, I installed it into the car without any issues.  It was a perfect fit and works great!<br /><br />I am very happy with the results and with the ability to find parts that will fit my vehicles on Amazon.
B000AUMYMM|5|I used it on my mazdaspeed3. At first I thought that the amount of paint that it has on that small container is not enough for multiple quotes. But It turns out that it can accomodate 2 cars as also indicated on other reviews. I think I had 3 coats on all 4x calipers and it turns out to be great. It looks very glossy and bright red. I think it took me about 3-4 hours painting but it's worth it.
B004GC944Q|4|Good quality replacement for a very rusty original radiator support.
B00B61ZZH0|5|Excelent Item , Its was expected , Fits With No Problem ....Great.
B003PI77XW|5|Very easy to put it on my 1989 E30, work perfect.
B000GKD5NI|5|A lot of other shades didn't fit, didn't stay attached, didn't do their jobs. Purchased this to keep sun off the baby and it's perfect. Months later and it still hasn't moved. Definitely buy.
B00784VU9G|5|Worked great fit perfectly
B00139YMUQ|5|I purchase this item in 2007, it was so perfect I could not stop myself from buying it again at this price. Outstanding.
B0077FJZYI|1|This item did not fit my vehicle exchanged for correct one
B004HZKZ7M|4|It is close to the hatch and you have to make sure the cargo does not interfere with the hatch.
B000M5YDT2|1|Received on time but doesn't work will not charge my batters
B00P3IAYSC|5|Great THX
B00NX8EYFI|5|Excellent - Item delivered on time, was as described, great customer service

B008Y7O156|4|real pain in the ass installing because the lines to the pressure transducer where over tightened and had to disassemble to install correctly
B00S09T8M4|5|[[VIDEOID:2974f41b4eb31051b02a8a23d30e0448]]There's a drought were I live now and washing our car outside our house isn't really an option unless you want to go to the carwash and pay extra. Plus I am a fan of saving water to help the community and the environment so I decided to give this a shot.     I don't really need a sparkling car. As long as it's not dusty where you can write your name on the window or windshield I am fine with that. However this product exceeds my expectations. It made my car looked like I washed it with water. I removed the water mark as well that our car got from I don't know where since it hasn't been raining. It has two sides, the one with cute finger like thing which is really good in getting dusts and the other side is more of like a microfiber towel that removes the water marks or dirt that's harder to remove.    Another plus is you can just wash it by hand or in your washer after you're done using it and just hang dry then you can use it again when you need it. But wait there's more! It's not just for your car. You can use it anywhere that collects dusts just like your furnitures. Oh believe me it works like charm! It collects the dusts and NOT put it in the air. I am super allergic to dusts and thank you for this I can now clean without worrying about my allergies.  I was lucky to be able to purchase it for a discounted price in exchange of my unbiased and honest review. If you find my review helpful kindly click YES. I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!
B000COVO6S|5|Great quality and performance. No hiccups in ignition after replacing with these wires and a new standard motors coil.
B00SLYVTNO|5|Works great, but a little noise, but when motor is running you can't hear it.
B007HTRWW6|5|have used this company before. Great Quality and service. Will continue to purchase from them. Great Fit and no problems with the mat curling.
B000GASW86|5|Very nice quality, they fit our Fleetwood American Tradition Motorhome tires like a glove. So pleased that we ordered these.
B008T4YOV0|4|Great helmet, the only negative is the front to back size on my forward is a little small. I've contacTed the company, but I'm not getting any response.
B010Q03LJU|1|the pre drilled holes on the angled support bracket are too close together to fit my 2007 4Runner. A ridiculous mistake that could have easily been avoided by drilling more ovoid shaped holes to allow for some variance in the distance between the mounting holes on hatches of various 4Runner models. Absolutely the worst purchase I have ever made through Amazon.   Update:     This product is so dangerous that I had to add an update. I managed to re-tool the improperly made bracket. What I did not realize was that the ball joint connection on the other end was not milled correctly to provide a secure fit for the ball joint receptacle. I discovered this improper fit when I closed the rear hatch near the end of our vacation. The poorly milled ball socket receptacle popped off of the ball joint and then the compressed strut shot to its full length through my rear hatch window. The rear window shattered and I was sprayed with broken glass. I was lucky not to get any glass in my eye. It terrifies me to think that my wife or child could have been the ones to close the hatch when the strut popped off of the ball joint. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE ASHAMED FOR SELLING SUCH A POOR AND DANGEROUS PRODUCT.
B005JU5UEW|1|It is leaving multiple streaks along the middle.  It doesn't smoothly clear the window.  The majority of the window gets wiped clean, but you have to overall all the streaks that will remain and dry in a light dirt streak.
B00E3XON44|5|Mats are what I was looking for as my husband's birthday present. Steering wheel cover is great too!
B0096BAYGY|4|still working well after a month installed on my 03 mdx
B000C9S78G|4|works like it should
B00FHSG6US|5|Perfect!
4678615343|5|Very important step when painting vinyl seats.  Expensive but one can of this lasts for about 8 cans of paint.  Gets a lot of black out too.
B00A3VA024|5|looks good, should be fine
B0002UHVAA|5|Too much toilet paper in your rv toilet = BIG PROBLEM. Don't waste time with anything else like chemicals or snakes. Get this, let it run for about ten minutes and the clog will come out. Saved me lots of $$ by not having to bring it in for service. Everyone who owns an rv needs one of these.
B0084UJ2E8|5|These are the best floor mats you can buy.  They are also the exact ones I needed.
B006VU36WC|5|This product works really well.  It takes all the hard water spots off the car windows.
B00IUWLZMW|4|Awesome battery great package for shipping. Hopefully it last!!!
B00KMYYQ5O|5|Seems a bit pricey but works very well. The big question is how long it will last.  After using on my Sunbrella hot tub cover and Sunbrella gazebo, both repel water great.
B00CIV1RK6|5|Look great an fit great
B0009YDQE4|5|My floor mats arrived the next day after I ordered them, although I think the large package they were shipped in was unnecessary. These cost much less than the floor mats I've come across in the stores & they serve the same purpose. They look good. Decent product, I'm satisfied.
B005ZWM0R4|5|ok
B00UG52P7U|1|It Was a Good idea. Bought this little nugget twice for our trip to the Grand Canyon. Well let me tell you the ipad mini worked great.  Unfortunately the first generation ipad or samsung note it did not. I had removed all coverings just to be disappointed on the size gap. Besides the lack luster design for small screens the headrest snap was a easy and fantastic idea for ease of clean up during the hotel stays. Don't give the bad guys ideas to break in your car if you don't have too. Overall measure your device size, add your casing/protective case and look at the size description. I wish I did this waste of time and money. I am super frustrated on this product. It could have been so good!
B00COYNZJ8|2|The front picture of this starting to peel off the cover as the summer sun seems to be melting it off leaving a huge mess on the dash floor and seats<br />I would not recommend this for hight temp areas  we live in TX  and AZ  This will not last extreme heat
B007JMTS14|3|It's a great connector and works awesome. The only complaint I would have Is that the rubber Caps You put on when the connector is not in use Are too loose and they fall off.I loose this is because they used The rubber caps To hold Connectors in the unit For shipping And this stretches out the rubber caps
B00252GGM2|5|An excellent product.
B002G5DLMQ|5|Great quality and exactly as described.  Arrived very quickly and looks great on the car.
B007XE8C74|4|Works as expected, Reads codes and shows readiness status.
B0064AMNT6|5|Sevice is good.
B00KWETMUS|5|Perfect!! Exact OEM part. Fast shipping too
B002UC1910|5|Looked great,  I lost it and never used it.  OH WELL!
B00G2KIUMM|5|Purchased this key fob and picked the wrong part number compare to my old one, but manufacturer contacted me and sent the right one right away. Customer Service is very good and guided me all the way until everything's work. This company has very good people and I am pleased.
B005K0235K|5|They work great...
B003BM1HX8|5|Worth every penny it cost.
B00NSUMRUU|5|This baby on board magnet couldn't have come at any better timing! I have a 10 week old niece and my brother and his fiance don't have one of these for either of their cars yet! Well, now they do! This fits perfectly on their trunk door right below the window and sticks perfectly. You can see it from quite a distance back, which hopefully means that people will be cautious when driving behind them. I was given the opportunity to receive this car magnet for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. All opinions are 100% my own.
B007T4JTHU|5|Perfect fit.
B00FEZMI4M|2|This item did not fit properly on 2006 range rover sport
B006ZVLAGG|2|A few complaints on this one. 1. O-Rings not included (the o-rings on the plastic plugs are entirely different then ones needed.) 2. It's shorter then original by about 3.5-4&#34;. (which means less filter and desiccant). The A/C Delco one is only a few more $$, I'd stay away from this one.
B0031W3GV4|5|Loved  the  fast  shipping  the  part  was  good  quality
B00KWDP83Y|5|Excellent
B00Y5GG53Q|3|Satisfied
B009YR00MI|1|I was very hopeful that I would get a working battery. It has been charging for 33 hours and even though the green light is on the battery charge level shows only 2 of 4 bars charged. I don't think it is returnable. Someone should test each battery before shipment. I may edit this later if the unit fully charges. Right now it seems doubtful.
B00D4OHVOW|2|The cover was a very poor fit for 2014 Honda CRV. It couldn't be  placed without covering a AC/heater vent. We were forced tom return it
B00JBIB63C|4|Not as dark as i would have like them to be but i like them
B001V8U12M|5|fantastic,saves a loy of time and effort
B00852684M|4|This is a great idea and I got these Abco Tech LED Flash Tyre Wheel Valve Cap Lights pack of 6 for my review.  They came really quick and as promised it was 3 colors of lights two each.  No real instructions so here they are:<br /><br />They come with 3 batteries that are inside of the units, you have to TAKE out the Paper block and put them back together, after that it is pretty easy they turn on when your wheels spin and the stop working when you stop.  They are not super heavy duty but you can easily get them on the kids bikes and remember they really work only when it is dark.  These would have been a solid 5 stars but the only problem is when you stop they quit lighting up so if you are stopped cars cant really see you at dark.  If I were commuting with my bike, I would use these every night for safety.<br /><br />Good deal for the price, also would be great for a motorcycle, not sure if they are legal on a car?
B001EOWQYO|1|didn't fit my receptacle. would have thought if there were more than one round 4 wire connection that they would have noted that it only fit style's &#34;x-y and z&#34; or something like that.
B00NI4XVO2|1|Very poorly made for being a custom cover. Doesn't stay on seat and seat belts dont line up like they said it would... They are now in the trash can
B00SYS46HI|2|The fragrance is not strong. Really only notice the air once you start the car and the A/C begins to blow.
B0085NREFI|3|it's a o.k. i still wanted it bad enough to buy it. it's not a secure fit. people look at me on the road as before i was ignored. the only concern i have is water the resistors that come with set don't stay inside the unit. there not LED there H3 halogen  and 1157 incandescent. hard wire led. over all i'll find out if there water proof Monday. if you have regular head lights you'll still need a projector set up for HID and LED H3 any my Original was 9007  head 3157 signal  I'll let guys know if there not water proof
B00ARARYDO|5|No more arcing out works awesome
B004QEJ6UQ|5|Perfect
B004GZSHSC|5|Easy install and looks very good on my Tacoma.
B00265FXTA|5|Direct replacement on my 2007 escalade. Great price
B00B2IO58W|4|did fine
B005CKFYEU|2|Stiff and difficult to handle to put into place and take out. It remains rolled up in the boot unused.
B005C5DL54|5|Quality OEM item received with usual Amazon efficiency and speed. This easy attached rack for my 2007 Royalstar Tour Deluxe adds much desired additional functionality whilst being easy detached along with detachable panniers and fairing for a stripped down look when required.
B00D8RYHHE|5|Good product, great customer service, fast shipping. First light had condensation in light after rain. seller Sent replacement fast and definitely water proof.
B00I9SK56O|5|Nice color
B000GD5FMY|5|Bad to the bone for the price. Better quality than any at full price.
B000CO9T60|1|The part sent to me does not fit my vehicle.  This is after providing all of my vehicle information.
B00JIIZCM6|1|This product is terrible.  It took the color out of my expensive leather bag, but did not take the pen mark out.  Garbage.
B001GJ3FIS|4|works fine,standard nozzle
B003NHVEV6|5|Fit perfectly
B00X2S2A8C|2|It's a good looking addition but, on the long front pieces the word &#34;CRUZE&#34; is not in the center .  I think it is detremental to the overall look and probably will not install them .
B005C58TXI|5|Perfect fit and sexy as hell
B000VKRQ8I|5|Great product worked great slid right into place to replace the old squeaking one.
B00E7BHQGE|1|Didnt work
B00SMQNSGM|5|Easy install and customer service was VERY quick to reply to emails and was very helpful with providing a wiring harness diagram. Headlights are VERY bright and it was definatly an upgrade from factory
B001O00P78|1|Installed this on a 2003 Vibe, good fit. The light came on at 1500 mi., I got 70,000 mi. from the OEM cat. that was under warranty, GM said everything was good but the cat.<br />Called Magna Flow and they wouldn't do anything. Buyer beware you don't get a warranty with this product.
B00MJ46ZS6|5|This car cover is awesome especially for the price. I highly suggested get this if you are in the market for a good car cover.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Fit on our jeep great!  So much room we didn't even fill it. Very secure on the roof.
B00PHTXWQS|5|These definitely need resistors to avoid hyperflash, but WOW they are blindingly bright!!!
B00YUVC3DC|5|Had it on for a week and liking it so far. Fairly easy install. Fits snug over the box. Seems to be water proof.
B005H6VW86|5|Came as said in the description!! Very happy with the product!! Nothing was broke! Again very pleased!!
B005FIUJ0S|5|super
B00GTIHCAS|5|Got it a day before scheduled, installed it on my 02 Xterra with no problem whatsoever, my vehicle has born again, after transmission issues, engine getting very slow between shifts, and a awful noise when pressing on the gas. Engine running smoothly and steady, great Hitachi product, I definitely recommend this. Loved that price also, compared to the $108.00 at my nearest auto part !..
B000RL2B2C|5|works well!
B00JIIZCM6|3|Not as good as I wished<br />I have a white leather couch that needed to cleaning after two years of use. I had on my couch stain of a blue pants which I was trying to clean with soap and water before. Sins the stain didn't came out decided to purchase this cleaner with a big hope that this stain to disappear. following the description was trying for a long time to clean it but the stain didn't really washed away. The rest of the couch got whiter and cleaner but it's also after working hard on cleaning it.  When it comes to real stain this product didn't really worked.
B00CHQV7CU|1|Wasn't as big as I wanted
B00COGK3O6|5|So much better than caulk for a camper roof
B000KZ0IS4|5|I have a 2006 Buick Rendevous and it was very simple to program. I will purchase an additional one.
B00W6E19F8|4|Works fine, But I think I like the Vickers sling more
B000J42QHW|5|Easy install, good fit.  This was a nice upgrade.
B002XJNQSY|1|Faded color.  Looks like it got printed from someone's basement. Not impressive.
B007KPWE4I|5|Worked well
B002G2YAVU|5|No issues
B00C5HCDGK|3|This item is very nice but it did not fit my RV.  I paid $40 .00  for shipping to me for both steps and tried to return them today and  it was  $75.00 per step. (Going To Plan B)  Almost as much as I paid per  step???????  MAKE SURE THEY FIT.
B00E9HWRK6|5|Great
B00A4HWRD2|5|Lasted the life of my phone, and beyond!
B00279OSFA|2|Did not include the wiring harness as shown in photos.  Also, the fuel line connectors are in a different orientation in relation to the OE one... Will be calling Spectra on Monday to see about getting the missing adapter.
B0054KSFI0|1|Bought this to transport my kayak, and after the first trip to a lake 4 miles away my footings looked like sine of the pictures on here. The seller was wonderful and refunded my money without having to ship the broken item back.<br /><br />I guess this may work for  lighter loads for some people, but I wasn't letting an inferior rack cut into my boating season. Spent the 300 for a solid name brand rack and have enjoyed many trips, for hours on the highway since!<br /><br />You get what you pay for, and if this breaks you will be paying for the damage to the vehicle behind you, beware!
B00EJSP4GO|5|What can I say about a b I mean an exhaust plug. It works as advertised.
B003N1TUMW|3|As described,
B00W5X71DO|1|What a ripoff.a street sign the size of a small ruler on a shiny piece of paper for $5.
B000MSDKMA|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING 5 STAR QUALITY
B00RLYRAWO|4|The cable  it perfect fit only the rubber  section  that block  the hole snap off  too tin
B007IPSXFO|5|Bought these to help my mom's husband as he's been forgetting where he sets things down and it's been a life saver
B0043XCFWG|5|A+++ Fast shipping and great product!!
B008427D88|5|Very good.
B004B61B34|5|You do not have to take exhaust or number off.  Took me all of 30 minutes to install with a 18mm, 19mm open end wrenches and some vice grips to hold the nut in place.  Running the electric is easy, hut I'll wire tie it in a fee places to make sure it extra secure.  Great product.
B00IWMKCOM|5|perfect fit
B00KZD8HNE|5|Works like a charm and really adds to my new vehicle.
B007A8OOBQ|5|very nice
B0008D6NK0|4|This product works great and as advertised; however, install was a bit of a pain due to the laser only pivoting on one axis!  So to put the laser pointing at a specific spot, you have to install with the car in the garage, line it up, and then try to mark.  If it was was a two-axis tilt, would've been no sweat at all.
B00CQC73AU|5|Perfect fit
B00IG0U0X8|5|What more can I say. Cool
B005U81556|5|I installed them on my Skidoo REV XP 2008 and they worked perfectly. Be careful if the ones you order have the handles or not. Available both ways. Easy to operate and quick. Have to come to a stop to adjust though!
B00N2BX9P2|5|My husband liked it a lot!
B00N2CJ4DW|1|Item definitely was not an exact fit for a 2000 Honda Odyssey EX. Cutting the rails would have been required, but they didn't come with any instructions, so there was no way to know exactly how to cut them, or if that would have even solved the problem. They immediately went back.
B001JSY9Q8|5|I had one of these years ago and always loved it.  Somehow I lost it and now ordered another one.  Keeps my loose coins organized in my car for quick access at drive-thrus.  Keeps several nickles, dimes, and quarters in the spring loaded top. Also has a bottom storage to keep pennies and any extra coins. Best of all, it fits perfectly in any cup holder.
B0002UENJ2|4|It does the job. The bottle is quite large for the contents. And the applicator is not for fine use, like treads. I suppose if you were using for engine parts that is one thing, but for firearm parts you need to be more creative or waste it.
B00D8RYHHE|1|Light looks good but the 32&#34; light bar I got is a piece of junk!!! In the features section it says it's IP 67 WP rated but it's really IP 68. This is false advertisement!!! I should get a IP 67 rated light bar since that's what there saying it is. Liars! 75% of the Allen screws are stripped out and are lose. One of the screw holes on the side of bad that holds mount to the bar is stripped out. So it's useless because it won't hold itself up. What I got was a light bar that someone bought and possibly tried to mount and stripped it out. I'll never buy a eyourself product again and you shouldn't either. What was I thinking buying a $70 LED light bar anyways. If if didn't look like it was used already I would be ok with it but these people screwed me. Thanks a lot.
B00062YNCI|5|Was looking for a replacement filter for a 1988 Itasca Phasar, this worked perfectly.
B00UY3IL4A|5|What a wonderful product this is! As most people with little ones can attest, a minivan can quickly become a complete mess without the right organization. For the last several months, we had gotten by with just a fabric bag in the back of the van- it's where we would keep all the toys, books, wipes, etc. Everytime we needed something, it would take forever to root through the bag for what you were looking for! Now that I have the car organizer, all that has changed! First of all, this organizer is strong and sturdy. Totally high quality, looks and feels great. I absolutely love that it stands up on its own and that it has the strap in case you just want to take the organizer with you. It has several pouches, and in different sizes so everything can easily have a place. I am most definitely a fan!! Now we have no excuse to not keep the van clean!! I received the item at a discount in exchange for my honest review. And I am so glad I did!!!
B003ULVNLQ|4|2012 Santa Fe - good fit in back and passenger side. Drivers side is also a good fit but you need to cut a hole for the gas door lever on the floor. Quick shipping.  Nice product.
B00DCNKV42|5|Works great, awesome price.  However I am only about 3000 miles in.
B00K7VE2VK|5|I'll be ordering more real soon.  I've used it on 2 cars and a 2001 F250 and they all turned out great.  No streaks, no haze no scratches.  The surface feels waxed.
B0052SF0LO|5|I'm totally impressed by the value and function of these lights. I have two of them on my farm. I use them for 'critter alarms' when they light when any size critter attempts to invade my birds or my goats. I am pleasantly surprised at how bright these lights are. They totally light up an area of 100' in front of them. The sensitivity as well as the amount of darkness required to them is super easy to set. And the pre wired cable is actually 15' 6&#34; long so there is a lot of flexibility in where you can mount them in relation to the solar panel. They are very good quality systems! I'll be adding more at other locations on my farm. For the price and the function of them I'd say they'd be very hard to beat!
B004HM0N4A|1|This fuse is advertised as 20mm in length.  But it's actually 12mm.  In fact if you look at the specs advertised it says 20mm(3/4inch).  Well 3/4 inch is 12 mm.  20mm is 1 1/4 inches.  Bad advertising.
B00EVY2SKG|4|Better deals in a bulk store but does the job. Works well with the ONR car washing methods.
B008VQQSEC|5|Good
B0038AXCQS|4|These headlight assemblies look great. However, they didn't work well with the LED headlight bulbs I had because of the way the reflector is designed. I tried regular halogens with it, and those were fine. For this reason, I returned them, but I didn't want to give a bad review just for that.
B007T1JXWO|5|perfect fit no problems
B000BO8X9K|1|Does not fit cat.was sold under false pretenses.
B009X1XMRU|5|Spicer quality at a good price
B000BNXOP4|3|I got this for my Dad's car and gotta say was a little disappointed. It wasn't as loud as I was expecting. I could barely hear it standing behind my Dad's car while he was parking. It's more like a notification alarm rather than an Alarm.
B00L847P3C|1|I had an issue trying to install them. I havnt been able to get much time off of work for a while now. They dont fit on my truck. Is it possible to return these?
B000BPUTF0|5|GREAT PRODUCT FAST SHIPPING 5 STAR QUALITY
B007ND4P0S|5|Shipping was about 5 business days. Some reviewers posted it took them about 10 minutes each side to swap out bulbs. It took me almost an hour for both sides on my 2006 525i E60 (That's including removal of both headlight assemblies which makes it easier to get to the bulbs) it sounds harder than it really is, there are tutorial videos online for that. And even then after removing the cap to access the bulbs the space is tight and since these led bulbs are longer it's more uncomfortable to put in. Other than that they are basic plug and play no cutting no splicing of wires. So I am now posting my review 8/8/15 a little over a week after installation and I can say they are barely any brighter than the stock yellow bulbs so they won't be visible during the day like the newer BMWs but I wasn't expecting it from 6 watt bulbs. However they are much nicer than the stock yellow bulbs. They are 7000k color but seem more like 6000K with maybe just a thin hair of a blue... but still gives a nice clean white appearance at night which is just what I was looking for anyways. No fault codes no flickering... they're both the same color. I've added a couple of pictures showing the difference between the yellow stock bulbs and LED bulbs and another picture showing both LED's installed. My only concern is how long will they last. So far so good for the price so I give a 5 star.    **********EDIT Jan. 2016**********  After a couple of months I suddenly noticed that both bulbs flicker on engine start up. I'm assuming this has happened since day 1, I just never noticed. But it's not a random flicker, it's a steady pattern with the same exact pattern every time. Other than that they still work fine.
B00C5SOES4|1|listing clams to fit my truck.. fast shipping but did not work in my truck..
B000GOG3LU|5|Did a successful install on an 2001 Infiniti i30. Ignore Subaru in title and Amazon's product link, this product fits perfectly and aligns properly. Be aware that the most common problem of air not blowing is the Amplifier/Resistor which is NOT included (typically cheap though), so if you are getting &#34;strange&#34; behavior (like always on or works on some speeds or not others), start there.<br /><br />Make sure to go ahead and order cabin filters as it's likely time for it and they are right there after installing the airbox.<br /><br />This blower was just installed today, but seems to be great quality and fits perfectly, so I expect it to outlast my vehicle. I'll post an update if it fails (I'm good about that, so assume it's still working otherwise)
B000KID2ZC|5|I had the exact model for two years when it was stolen from my sister's home. I used it all the time without ever having any problems.<br />I am glad that I replaced it for another INNOVA 3120  Diagnostic ScanTool/Code Reader.
B005UGJ5HI|5|if you are wearing a buckle strap boot it is easier to just push strap through clip.<br />no more constantly adjusting my pant legs while riding... looking like I got something hidden in my boot.<br />look good,  & stay put
B0057WO0YS|4|I liked look very nice.
B00TUA0ARE|5|Amazing great investment.
B00BITKBD8|5|Excelent
B007V2DSAY|5|Perfect fit
B004JBX2LU|3|I would give 5 stars but, the kit was missing parts,I called air lift and they said they would ship the missing part should have it by 8/12/2015 but we will see? very easy to install, had my 4 yr old daughter help me put the bag together, I installed them about 2 1/2 bags and air compressior. Would recommend it but would take inventory of all parts.
B00X69TE9U|1|They suck
B00XB27K0W|3|I really liked the floor mats, the seat covers were said to fit my jeep but were to big and not as durable as expected. I all, OK I guess.
B005H12JFG|5|As described.
B00HV0RXI4|4|I've been getting so many compliments on this. It was extremely difficult to put together though.
B00P9WK1AI|5|Great Alternative to dealer part
B000G6M3VC|5|Great quality tire gage, more accurate that a manual gage.
B0076QWL4E|5|Excellent.
B005CWA812|5|Good product.  Met all expectations
B001DH2TSA|4|fitment in my 08 f150 was spot on. the quick connects have a different thread size as the stock ford ones. this is not that big of a deal but you will need a special tool to remove the lines for the trans cooler. just search &#34;ford transmission line removal tool&#34; i used the ones from lisle. i wish i would have know about the tool before starting.
B000K02DDW|4|Works as described.  Worked fine in my 1998 Pontiac Firebird even though Amazon said it wouldn't.<br /><br />Note this is specific to Driver side.  I had made mistake and bought two thinking they were identical on each side.  The way the metal bracket is oriented is different between sides.
B000EDUUHQ|3|Tried these to see if they would work in our camper. They don't work for our needs
B006FQIQG8|5|Works good
B0093A9JIW|5|Excellent fit and finish! Full coverage on the windshield keeps the car cooler.
B002P8QV0S|5|High quality and a very good price.
B0070274ZK|5|The quality is really great. Exactly what I wanted.
B004LF6KJU|5|Item worked perfect. Easy to install.
B003AMLKIQ|5|Great.
B00DP4WTD4|5|Awesome .
B00D9E3GTG|5|For my picnic collection. Coke products. Good value
B003O1AENK|5|Replaced the wore out arms on my car with these.  Better than ever.  Istallation was a breeze.
B00ANZW28U|5|first sun shade worked great....so purchase another for our second automobile!
B0070Y363C|3|Never had a chance to install, no instruction really.
B00NB8U7S8|4|Great package, except the dome lights do not fit. If they change the size, I would definitely order again.
B0009TUGUG|3|Cap is ok
B00UIB9EC6|5|It exceeded my expectations and arrived exactly as promised.  I would definitely recommend this supplier.
B008Y9K0OU|5|As described.
B001GMX8SW|5|Easy install and works just right.
B00K4Q43ZS|5|Pretty good wash mitts. I bought them for my motorcycle and they work very well without scratching if used correctly. I am very happy with these. Only used them once so can't speak to longevity, but they seem to be well-.
B000C13R16|5|Replaced a leaking drain plug in a 1989 Jeep Comanche 4.0L. Fit great and fixed the leak.
B008Y9K3VU|5|Great Fit.  Works perfectly.
B00FSG3DTG|5|Loved it. It was much bigger than I expected and was very bright!
B0010EB6SA|4|It's a good filter but driving with it for 1000 miles i dont notice a difference compared to a regular filter so at the moment not really worth the extra 6 dollars compared to a cheap filter. maybe it will last longer or keep smelly away longer but i will see.
B00537FR08|5|Perfect fit for 2 5/16&#34; ball, packaging appropriate for shipping this item, wish I had thought of it years ago......
B010S6B9LE|5|Very easy to set up. This product was featured on 'subie speed' youtube channel. They give clear instructions as well as tips to set this up, Make sure you use a towel and a flathead screwdriver that way you don't scratch your paint when removing the towhitch cover.
B000FW2MWW|5|Just what I thought it would be
B005DWYJTI|5|Amazing sound, smooth. I know exactly nothing about trucks. And whole swap done in 90 minutes
B000HYL20G|5|I added this on to hit the $35 free shipping limit but am really happy with it now that I have it. It does what it does very well and I am glad I purchased it. The Magnet seems strong and it will stay attached to all surfaces I have tested it on quite securely. The sticker seems on a bit too well but I'm ok with leaving it their for now.
B00EK5939U|1|You pay for what you get.  It's not worth spending money on this especially within two weeks after purchasing the glue that seals the lens comes apart. I contacted the seller who told me that if I exchanged the product that they cannot guarantee me that it won't happen again because it is manufacturer faulty.  I would not recommend this. This would be like a quick temporary fix until you get a good quality lens!
B002FT5N7Y|5|Works as expected
B005MYKDF6|3|It works and it's VERY inexpensive.  No emergency flashers and the housing is cheap looking even from a distance.
B00DTDES6C|5|These are awesome shocks. However to install them on my 2014 Street Bob I had to remove the old shocks, lift the bike up to extend the swing arm all the way down, then compress the new shocks just to get the bolt holes to line up. Not as easy as instructions and videos make it look.
B000Z0HVHA|2|The end snapped off inside my car socket
B0094Y44MI|5|This was a hard to find color.  My order came quickly and I was pleased. Thank you.
B000CD5QN6|4|Really helped the ride quality
B00TPXAWKQ|5|This is my 2nd Bedrug purchase.  I sold my 2010 Dodge 1500 and purchased a 2015 GMC Canyon.  I immediately ordered this rug and would not consider any other type of product for the bed of my truck.  Adds elegance to it.  A professional installed my first Bedrug.  I watched an installation video on youtube and knew I could do it myself.  It was EXTREMELY easy and it was done in about 30 minutes.  Between the video and the included written instructions, it was a snap.  I like to ride my dogs around the lake in the back of the truck on my dirt road and they love the soft flat-surface for standing up in the back.  The material is soft and durable.  You can take the rug out and wash it I'm told, but I have never had to.  I guess I'm not very hard on it.  Can't say enough positives about it.  Best of all, if you decided you didn't want it any longer, you just remove it.  Try doing that with a sprayed on bed liner.
B00OOCP38O|5|It's bright as hell!!<br />Wonderful product<br />Will never buy a more expensive one this one gets the job done<br />Only thing is the whistle<br />But my sound system drowns it out
B001EOWQY4|4|Worked as expected
B000OQIGA6|4|Worked as advertised.  I had no problems with the cap seals but did have to get a foot of 1/4 inch copper tubing to fit in the oil filler hole of my Briggs and Stratton engines.  I knew about this from reading reviews and was prepared.  Other that that, a great product at a very competitive price compared to other on line sites.
B007CDYXHE|5|love it
B0040CTTH4|5|Cosmetically not an exact duplicate of the OEM clip, but in terms of size, shape, hardness (durometer) and function it is an excellent replacement. I used them to reattach the interior panel on the hatchback of my 2006 Toyota Prius, which I had to remove to replace the two license plate lamps. There was no problem using these as replacements for the OEM clips. I would use these again if needed.
B00F9VNPC0|4|Because these Bosch ICON blades come in single packs, I also have Bosch 21OE ICON Wiper Blade - 21&#34;, Pack of 1. They are essentially the same product, the only difference being the length. So my thoughts on this product are essentially the same:<br /><br />Most wiper blades on the market are going to be just fine. Even with less expensive blades, I've neither had any installation issue nor problems with window-streaking. These Bosch blades are no different. They will work well in all types of weather and fit your windshield well (provided you buy the correct length). The installation is even made especially easy because the blades are OE (&#34;original equipment&#34;) so they don't require any adapters, and Bosch has even printed a quick installation guide on the back of the packaging.<br /><br />The general difference between low quality and high quality blades comes down to life expectancy, and these blades seem like they will last a while. They claim to last 40% longer than other wiper blades, and I believe... Read more
B002H1LV1C|5|The helmet was excellent! No problems at all!
B00CA5VP70|5|OK
B00UL3DQKW|5|THEY WORK GREAT!!
B00P2D4C36|5|Good deal.
B0091QL788|4|Decent helmet for the price.  Quality is what you would expect at this cost.
B00JV59QR8|4|Good quality item. Easy to install.
B00WI0MX0U|4|This multi-tool is smaller than some of the other ones we have used or bought but it appears quite sturdy; it's approximately 5 1/4 inches in length. The knife isn't overly sharp but it's not dull either; it's about what you would expect to get from a kit such as this. It comes with the usual multi-tools, such as a saw, screwdriver heads, a file, and a bottle opener. The size makes it easier to carry and it fits quite well in our glovebox. I like the color as well. Time will tell how well it holds up over time but at least on initial uses it's quite nice.
B00ODEDKKG|5|Very nice cover. Fit perfectly.
B005FUU7EY|2|Lights look good but thwy sent me 2 different colored dome LED's so I wasn't able to put them in.
B00F8LEB9W|5|I limped along on one fob for years; bought these; and, programed them with good directions in a matter of moments. We humans are strange. We let the little things annoy us for a long time and sometimes never do anything to remedy an irritation. Get rid of one problem in your life right now - buy these three button keyless entry devices.
B007KJ2RZK|5|Great!
B00WABI9J6|1|The instruction is terrible. You have to cut the wire to fit. Incompatible connectors.
B004XEQMLU|5|Great product!
B005PZMKZI|2|the sea covers were difficult to fit on the seats - also the stitching was already coming loose on one of the front seat covers.  Will be returning them.
B00E0HFD4W|5|Just what I needed at great savings.
B000ELP7TY|1|Purchased for a customer chevy express 3500 end of July. Installed on July 31st, 2015. Today is October 1st, 2015 and starter has been failing to engage. Sometimes it starts and sometimes it will not. So two months is about all I will get out of this starter. Price was great and Amazon service was excellent, but product quality isn't there. Looked good out of box and is the same starter I would have received from the big chain stores, but could have ran over to local store and replaced. First thought this was going to be a good purchase, but in the end it turns out to be a bummer. I did purchase a starter from two of the bigger chains, but realized they were all the same starter in different boxes. So that's why I went with Amazon's lower price. I wanted an AC Delco, but not to be had. Time is money and this now cost me big time. Customer is pissed and I'm going to have to warranty the starter and labor. Just sucks when you think you did it right and saved a few bucks doing it! Like they say, &#34; you get what you pay for&#34;. Maybe just a bad unit out of a lot, but can't take a chance on another one since vehicle repairs is my livelihood. Thanks Amazon for the service.
B007QV12OO|4|No instructions but does the job.
B0055PD1H4|5|The pictures from the reviews are correct! I needed about half a tablespoon of product on my rag for each fender. A little goes a long way! Definitely worth the $9 and shipping. It's going to last about a year I'm thinking, maybe even more. Made my '97 Pathfinder look 10 years younger ;)
B0022ZJX1I|5|Much better than factory grips and just about the best aftermarket rubber grips I have found. They are relatively large in diameter, a quality that keeps my fingers from cramping on long rides. The cubical design of the grip texture provides good traction under any condition. As long as they keep selling these, I'll keep putting them on my bikes.
B006EGAIII|5|These things work so much better than the metal ones.  I brought these for my father in law they work great.  My metal ramps slide when you try to use them.  These won't slide.  I'm going to have to buy me a set and get rid of the metal ones.
B003TU662Y|3|Maybe the product is too good?  It scrubbed so hard it frayed my rugs.  They look old and shaggy now.  I would've ordered a softer bristle brush had I known.  Luckily this happened before trying on seats.  I hand terry toweled seats.
B007V8WBPQ|5|ok
B000WEKQ3K|1|I ended up sending them back. After two tries they didn't fit my car.
B00CA5PJ5O|5|worked great!!! I am very pleased with the two i bought and will use this service again if needed.<br />THanks again
