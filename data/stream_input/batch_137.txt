B00M4OCEPY|4|Easlily Installed, except,  i had to use the existing grommet seals, the ones with the kit were not pliable enough to let me push light in, even when lubricated.  The taillight is not as visible from the side view as the original, but worked as described, no real complaint.
B000WK2COA|5|Service was GREAT! It arrived in two days. It was brand spanking new as the acid was separate. Installation was very easy! Highly recommended!
B000CHKUJ2|5|Matched original perfectly.
B001GRMBQ2|1|I used the option to see if this product fits into my Jeep. It says yes, but it's too big. It appears that the speaker in the back right section of cargo area (factory) will not allow the mat to lay all the way down. Now I have to figure out if it's worth trying to return. Buyer beware.
B005V2XXV0|5|Awesome product
B0045V8CKU|5|I don't know how Honda gets away with charging so much money for their crossbars; they seem identical to the these bars.  The instructions we straight forward and the installation was fairly easy.  The only thing that was a problem was that I had to remove a small plastic spacer from each of the anchor bolts that are part of the car roof.  These spacers were not referenced in the instructions and made it impossible to install the crossbars.  Once I figured out what the problem was and removed these spacers, everything went fine.<br /><br />I have used these bars with a Yakama Kayak roof kit and everything works great.  These crossbars are a great deal.
B004C46ISS|4|This was a gift to my mother and she really enjoyed them. I see these in her Dodge Truck for a while until some other design catches her eye.
B000ZRW78Q|5|I installed it on my truck in order to run an offroad LED lightbar. It works great, easy to install. Will be purchasing again for my other truck.
B004I0J7M0|5|Fits my 1999 Toyota Corolla well. Looks shining. Love it:)
B00L3ZCEJQ|5|Easy installation
B0054JV4DY|5|Awesome
B00LL6PK2K|5|works great
B000CO7Y4E|5|Work Great. Look Great.
B00CBTRN26|1|Never work
B006QQ0WCS|5|I just ordered another one of these because the one I received was of such nice quality.  The graphics are on the front and back as well as on the sleeves. Some Fox T's can be had for 9-10 bucks with free s/h and are great too.  But this one was so much nicer I felt it was really worth the extra cash.
B000CIKC76|2|This is a good project shifts good but on another note they do not give u the bearings to go with it.  Lucky I own a junk yard and just got a bearing from there
B00NFFDYO6|4|Just what we were looking for
B00L6UVU8Y|1|Don't waste your time or money. You will be returning them. The instructions are absolutely horrible I think they just copied some random wiring diagram pictures from the net and printed them out and placed in the box.  I ended up replacing with a full pair of headlight assembly for my BMW with two Halo connections and a pair of driving lights that ALL worked 1st time vs dealing and trying to figure out what these instructions are trying to say to do.
B004MGI7HG|5|Funny, yet poignant... gets the message across with a smile :)
B00590WYN2|5|The product arrived as expected. I found the  quality to be similar to the original equipment from Toyota. While the mirror did not come with instructions from the manufacture for installation, I found instructions online pretty quickly and provided me with the information to remove the inner door panel remove the door lock wiring, access the mirror panel and replace the mirror.  ([...])  $400 plus saving from the dealer.    I was doen in less than 40 minutes including the search for a dropped screw!    Motors for mirror adjustment and lights worked as expected first try...
B0040MGUKI|5|Best car detailing chemicals I have used. I use all the chemical guys chemicals and have a car with a flawless paint shine that lasts.
B00480J4JG|5|Excellent Product. I took the original part and verified that it was the same Brand and Part Number. We had no problems with the delivery. Despite the fact that the shipping box seamed not adecuate for this fragile and expensive product, it arrived in good condition.
B000VU57YS|5|Great
B00BG3GGX0|4|The product has an excellent cost benefit.
B001T3WXMA|3|The headlights work great but, I have had them for 2 years and the rubber gaskets around the headlights have started to break apart. The lenses are still clear and the lights are still bright. If it wasn't for the cheap rubber they would get five stars.
B00B9FEBSW|3|Shell broke after a few months of being in my pocket. Otherwise, works good and price is right.
B000C81RJS|5|Original OEM part, for my 1991 RX-7 NA.  It got rid of a code 17 &#34;Feedback System&#34; Error that I couldn't cure with a new Oxygen Sensor.  Apparently a code 17 can also be triggered by a bad point in the TPS.  This code 17 also caused the check engine light to flash on periodically while driving.  Now all is well and no more error codes.  Just be sure when installing you are using an LED TPS test light and grounding the test connector near the battery.  Check out RX7club dot com forums for the how to set TPS procedure.
B001RBCU90|5|Just makes sense for a caring dog owner.
B00A1O72TW|5|Works as described I use it with dash and it is awesome!
B0099RKG1S|2|worked fine until it failed after 6 months of use....
B00BDQ4BNM|1|The antenna didn't fit the car 26.00 I purchased another one that fit the car and it only cost 5.26 I took the one I purchased from Amazon to Chrysler dealership and it should had only been charged 8.59
B00EZUL6ZY|5|slight smell at first.  used in a 2015 Camry.  they are a bit too small, but still work well.  keeps small amounts of water within the mat itself.  easy to clean.  they seem quite durable.
B002EOVDII|4|It does everything a much more expensive unit does.  I like it better than one I paid four times as much for.
B00AEAXU3A|5|Bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas he loves it had to return it for a bigger size but the seller made it really simple and easy and they kept in contact with us the whole time and answered any questions<br />Now about the vest it is really nice and thick he loves the concealed pockets since we live in ca<br />Way better than vests he has had in the past
B00KSMMORM|5|Good just what I needed and customer service was great
B00IXDN0Y4|5|Super nice looks very good bright bright bright. Very happy
B0061J4H8K|5|They work perfectly..!  They even had bulbs already installed in them.
B00GJ1FIZG|5|nice!
B0002Q7FV4|5|No vibration. Quality mirrors. Easy on and off. Once installed they look like factory mirrors. Sure beets paying 500 to 1000 dollars for new mirrors.
B00585NHWA|5|Love this decal so much, I had to tell my friends about it. Can't wait to put it on my car!
B0014BAJAU|5|I have a Branson 3510 and the filter fit perfectly.  It was exactly what I needed and I will order another next year.
B00EZ4CCGW|5|Fast shipping, exactly as described.
B004CULV70|4|\\"great for pre teen\\" At first I got a bit of flack from my 12 year old son about the gear for riding his dirt bike...but this neck brace saved the day.  He really likes it and it stabilized the helmet and jacket.  Thanks very much!
B000AMBHFU|4|Works as advertised, easy installation, price was right.<br /><br />Delivery was on time and with a little instruction from a pro, placing it in the right position was easy.
B0002U2V1Y|5|Night and day difference with how the finish of my truck feels. I am now a clay bar believer.
B00K6RSLLC|5|As described.
B001OIRUKK|3|The fit of the mats isn't quite as good as you would expect from a factory product. And the material isn't as thick/heavy as you would think either.
B001EAQTRI|5|I installed this after getting a lot of feedback from a Bluetooth audio device which feeds through the aux input. The difference is incredible, all the buzz is gone.
B000BQM5C4|5|Work Great and priced right.
B007Q8ETTC|5|I start with the cons first, since it's easier to get out of the way.<br /><br />Cons: it's a bit costly,<br /><br />Pros: + great quality<br />  + fits perfect<br />  + not bulky<br />  + Great Design<br />  + easy to clean<br /><br />I would definitely purchase again!
B000MXW2EM|5|Does what it should do, just follow the instructions, to start it the check valve needs to be straight up until the fluid gets all the way through it. makes the job easy.
B009PHDM5Y|5|Works as expected.  Installed on my 2008 Saturn Vue in minutes.
B00OSXSVAG|5|i am very please with these mirrors they make my bike look better
B005OZ944E|5|great fit and a lot lighter weight than the other pants i wear. would definitely buy these again if i had to
B004BSNNY2|4|This gas seems to do the trick. Can't tell the difference from the other competitor but seems to do what it is designed to do.
B0017RCK44|5|Fuel pump was loosing pressure when off.  Engine was hard to start until cranking long enough to build fuel pressure.  Installed valve and now cranks up right away
B000C42SFE|5|The mounts worked perfectly, arrived faster than my local parts store could get them (thanks to Amazon Prime) and at a lower cost.
B004SRU8EO|5|Love them. Expectations exceeded
B0052VVCAE|5|sweeeet
B007TWEZ9Y|5|Awesome! This patch is great and really easy to put on a jacket. Excellent detail in the stitching as well.
B002XHDHPS|5|This was exactly as described. I love the way it looks on my daughter's wall. Very easy to place on the wall.
B006T0IABQ|5|My trucks older lights were faded and looking pretty sad. I like the new face lift. By the way my old one were leaking, allowing water inside.
B00CNUUU5A|4|One small glitch, did not quite match up with slide in . A few minutes with a drill to widen and align the two and it was good to go. I was satisfied with over all work man ship and quality. I would definitely order from them again.
B000C9G0JY|5|Great Replacement, direct fit on my MN12 Thunderbird 92, work as expected, make sure to give full service to your brakes
B00TVROQYE|5|Love this. Super cute!!! Looks great on my suv
B005JU5XE4|5|Fit is great so far, I hope they hold up to the reviews!
B00C7Y89YG|5|Perfect!
B00O8ZNJ2Y|5|Very, very bright lights.  Look great on the jeep.
B0000AZA0X|5|Havent had to use it but it seems to be a nice recovery strap
B000H5WRPO|5|kept me from having to buy a new tire for my cart that I use behind my riding mower and it was much cheaper than a new tire. extends the life of my old tire tremendously. thanks
B0000AY2Z6|4|I bought this fan because there are no other comparable choices when it comes to 12v portable fans, and the roof mounted RV fans have been excellent performers. However, Fan-Tastic uses a different motor in the box fan. Consequently it is a bit noisier and transmits a whine at 2369 Hz or D6 on the piano keyboard. This might not bother most people but it is annoying to this trained ear. A factory tech acknowledged the whine but said the motor currently used for the fan was the best they could find for this application.<br /><br />When not in the RV the FTF runs indoors off the Schumacher PC-6 120AC to 6A 12V DC Power Converter - no complaints there.
B005HR1U96|5|very, very nice! worth every single penny spent! so bright when I look in my rear view mirror I can see reflection from the brake light in the front grill of the vehicle 40 yards behind me!
B0027HX2TA|5|I was worried that I was going to be disappointed with the Body Armor line of products. There are limited reviews available here or on the forums that rave about these products. I spent most of a day installing the Body Armor Rear Bumper, Roof Rack Base, Swing Arm, and Cargo Basket. They are solid and although I had to fight to align the bolts occasionally there was very little that I would consider difficult and I did not have to drill anything on my Jeep. The directions were available and I thought they were adequate to accomplish each assembly easily. I will just say that if you are hesitating or having difficulty in deciding; Body Armor products look great, are solid, and give you options beyond the \\"CrappyBuilt\\" lower end products and the higher end products which I could not afford. I was able to put the rear bumper, roof base, swing arm, and cargo basket on for under $1500.
B00RUYH5WK|5|Good quality everything was installed with out any problems
B002LNJZKU|5|Good product. Wish I wish I had started using it sooner. The worst area on my big couch looks pretty good. The better areas and the other pieces look pretty decent. I will continue using it.
B00BGEO7DK|5|I am happy with those mats: front ones are a perfect molded fit! Works great! I was kind of surprised that the back mat is small and is there more for decoration purpose, because of the size: If you imagine someones dirty boots on the mat, you would see that they would have to sit very nice and tight in order to fit and keep them on the designated rubber area. But again: this is a luxury class Grand Cherokee, probably designed with two people owning and using it in mind :) I have two toddlers :) My leather seats are covered with seat protectors, back seats have kick mats and there is not much luxury feeling left back there. So, I guess,  there is no mat in the world that would be snow boot wearing 5 year old proof. But me and my husband are very happy with the front ones: they will do the job great protecting driver and passenger seat area from mud, water, and my high heels!
B000E2CVDI|5|Love these filters! Fast shipment! Thanks a lot!!
B004FP85TO|5|Adore these. They were great on the exterior of the car, on the lap top, or a clip board, been disappointed I couldn't get them from this seller again
B002G244UM|5|Great brush set with unique tips for detailing
B0024ECBMA|5|This fit perfectly on my class B Camper Van.  (85 Horizon).  Check to see if you need a vertical or horizontal regulator... although, the only reason for this is to keep the vent pointed down so that it stays clean and free of debris.
B00G4O1ZCS|5|Ended up getting the wrong size (my fault) and had to return, but great quality part, had no problems with the return, everything was handled quickly and professionally. Will use in the future!
B002M4GEZW|4|I bought these after one of my headlights was damaged.  Since they were both rather old, I replaced both.  I was impressed with the fit and finish, and happy to find that they came with bulbs!<br />The only &#34;nit&#34; was that the height adjusting screw coming out of the back of the light is a bit too long, and hits part of the frame behind the headlight assembly.  I had to cut about a half inch off so that I could install the lights without the screw getting in the way.
B0027UTJHQ|5|Fits like a glove. Very stable. Easy to put in. Didn't take very long to replace. The worst part was getting the old one out.
B004ZU9EB2|2|The ball joint and plate were a perfect fit however the top lock nut did not fit onto the ball joint stud. The stud us a metric 14'm course thread and the nut I received was a 1/2&#34;x30 thread. I had to get a friend to drive me all around town trying to find a nut for it. Advance Auto, O'Rileys, Lowe's, and Home Depot didn't have anything that fit it. I finally found a nut at a local hardware store. Could have just been a hickup during assembly but with all the other sellers it would be safer to try someone else.
B001O10HTS|5|So easy to install! Dealership wanted over $600 to replace them.
B001554V7C|5|Looks and works great!  Wish it comes with flat-head screws and screw caps.
B00838808A|5|Works as designed!!  Installed on my RZR 1K about 1 month ago.
B00004X13X|1|When I first bought this oil pan/container, I thought it was pretty neat, because it has a screen and a large twist cap that allows the container to be stood up after changing the oil.  Well, after three oil changes, I have thrown it out.  The small twist-off cap cracked and broke, and the large twist-off cap leaks when stood up.  If buying this pan/container, only use as a drain pan - not for storage or transport.  I would recommend a regular drain pan with a large opening, as this one's opening is quite small.  I made a mess when I used it, as the position needed to be adjusted - and forget about trying to line up this pan with the oil filter.
B005BFGTXQ|2|wolves keep falling off valve cap no matter what glue or adhisive i use.
B000BRJOW2|4|Looks good, functional. Will have to see how long it lasts in the Arizona sun!
B000W0RQ8C|1|I just received this item today and it does not work.  The key provided does not turn or unlock the lock.  Now I have to go through the bother of returning this useless piece of junk.
B001O0CQXO|2|The lug itself is great, but you can almost scratch off the red finish with your finger nail.  Scratch almost immediately.  Suggest extreme care installing these, or cover them in tape when installing them?
B00EQBOXHA|5|It performed exactly as advertised. A wonderful alternative to bulky, hard to store, jumper cables
B0002SA226|4|Only drawback is that car needs to be drilled so if you not handy then it will be a pain.
B009B323P2|4|It looks like light smoke insted dark smoke....
B00BQE5JAK|5|Lights sent fast and were exactly as described, wired correctly and plenty bright. Will soon order some more, buter longer strings this time.
B0085SQIS2|5|I read so many reviews on so many types and what each one needed to install if you have done any research you know there are way to many choices and different price ranges! So far I really like this system easy to read and install directions were reasonable to understand. After installing the Vance & Hines Slip on and a Little Big Sucker Air filter this just pushed performance over the top on my 2012 Harley Davidson Super Glide FXDC Wish I could describe how it sounds! WWWWWAAAAAAAAHHHHH If you do need to adjust it they answer emails quickly and there are 3 screws to adjust to  your needs ( like for a carburetor but electronic) as upgrades come easy to understand and maintain. Thanks Charlie M. ;o)
B0009XXM0S|1|This is not the right belt!! it is way too short. Please send correct belt for my 1998 Olds Bravada This one says on pkg it is for 1996 Cheverolet / GMC
B000EVWDU0|4|Works like a champ to check my coach and chassis batteries in the motor home. Built in RV systems are not accurate so this tool is perfect.
B00E1J0BGE|5|Excellent. Nice thick but pliable rubber material. Should extend the life of the floor carpet (remove your floor mats).
B00FS9JXAQ|5|The valve cover gasket set performed as described. Installed said gasket with no leaks noted. Thank you very much.
B001GJ7HCI|5|I recently got a new vehicle and wanted something newer and cleaner so that I could not scratch the clear coat.  This works great for cleaning bugs off of the front of your car and windshield.
B001DKR6CQ|5|Not the first set of them i've used (different size) but I love them.  Very easy to use and great traction.  Can get them at Napa for about $130, so they are a great price here.
B000Q71N8K|5|Best bang fopr the buck, just pre cool 24hr ahead or have some ice packs
B001H1I40O|5|Thanks
B0087FSA70|5|This stuff simply works. My headlights were really hazed so I went ahead and wet sanded them (1000,1500,2000) then used an orbital polisher to buff the lens to a jewel shine. Sprayed the clear coat and it's been looking new since. On another car with light hazing I used the cleaner spray only and it magically took all the oxidation off and made it look brand new. For heavy and old oxidation wet sanding is the best method followed by the clear coat application.
B000FPY63M|3|I purchased these for my 01 Jeep Cherokee.  They took about an hour to install and do their job well enough, even with out instructions. To install them I had to remove the factory bumper and upon reinstalling everything I found out two of the factory jeep bolts were not long enough for the added thickness of the brackets and the bumper mounts.  It was no problem for me because i have a collection of bolts in my garage.  The rear bolts that do come with the brackets are zinc coated and appear to be grade 8 bolts so they are plenty strong. I have one issue and the was with the slots in the bracket where the supplied bolts are held in place.  The slots were spaced too large and i had to hold the bolt with a set of pliers to finish the installation.
B006FDD74W|5|Great replacement case.. works perfectly
B000C9GDWI|5|Thanks to these rotors I finally have a GM product with decent brakes. A little hard to install on my 1998 K 2500.
B000KL73SQ|5|I have used these in the last four vehicles I had, the rubber is softer than the husky mats, making them more pliable and easier to lay where you want them.
B000BPTUFK|3|It was very short but it will do the job if it reaches what you are trying to connect...Again short.
B009AXIFXW|5|This is a great HID relay harness at a awesome price! worked exactly how i needed it to and had no problems. helped my HID's out alot.
B0049CNX36|5|Installs easily and very clean looking.
B00B5NPL7I|4|Looks like what I wanted
B00DU6R7R0|5|Great Helmet have worn it a few times and I must say it is pretty sweet especially with the ability to open it half way up nice touch. The inner tinted visor is also helpful from shielding from sunlight and overall nice helmet design. It is definitely a snug fit so those who wear a large in other brands should consider an XL or basically one size up from what you wear from another helmet type.
B0009IBJAS|5|just perfect and i love it
B000H8XNF4|5|I was nervous about ordering an aftermarket light, but this was better quality that the OEM lights! Super bright, very sturdy, excellent packaging and quick shipping. THANK YOU!!!
B005CO9FDW|5|powerful herramiente for easy handling of commercial refrigeration, requires proper use to keep equipment in good condition and easy maintenance

B002GU4SN2|5|I have been using Ring Free Plus in my 1985 Mercury 90HP Outboard Motor.  I bought this Motor new and over the years it became a real pain starting it after I shut it down to pick up a skier or a tuber.  I had to push in the button and advance the throttle to get it to start every time. Then I would put it in drive then it might die.  An old friend told me about ring free so I started using 1/2 an ounce to 5 Gallons of 91 octane without ethanol. The same full I have always used in my power sports equipment. I slowly notices a marked improvement. By the end of last summer my Mercury was running like the day I bought it.  I continue to use Ring Free Plus, the best $20.00 I ever spent.
B00DGDEZT0|2|If you are going to try to clean your car waterless with this product you better have a lot of time and about 300 towels.<br />I tried to clean the headlamps and could not tell that I had put anything on them, so that didnt work for me.<br />if you ran your car through a car wash and took it straight home and went to work on it you could probably make it look a little better but  not all that great. IMHO
B000C1Q6LE|5|Works fine in Acura MDX rears. Feels same as whatever was on there before, no dusting.
B0074BO428|1|Buy the anzo headlights for 15 more because these spyder ones were terrible made cheap!!!  Also low beans on two pair were not even first burnt up the lens second had high beam issues and neither low beans were centered and not bright anzo blows this headlight away!!!
B00803FPV8|5|so cool!
B0000AY3SX|5|takes the white wax off of plastic very well
B00CJ6HFX8|5|It's was great and fast delivery
B007HGE2JU|3|Just finished installing this plate on my CR-V.  It was a very difficult task to complete.  Directions are not complete.  We worked over 2 hours to try to remove the yellow tabs on the front grill, finally had to cut them off and purchase new ones at the Honda dealer the next day.  Secondly, the directions do not show you how to remove the bumber facia.  We had to go to a body part shop and have them show us how to remove the bumper from the vehicle - it takes a special tool to push down on the tabs carefully to separate the facia with the body. This was not shown in the directions provided by Blue Ox.  Finally, we had to saw off the nuts on the receptacle that receives the base plate as the tubular steel was too large for the existing receptacle you bolt the base plate to. Overall, I will never do this again - unless you have the right tools and good clear directions you will have problems.  Blue Ox needs to improve their directions to clearly show how to remove tabs and bumper facia.
B00A1C7532|5|Nice.
B007JTVMLQ|5|Perfect. Using on CTX700.  The OEM Honda Tall Windshield on the CTX still causes helmet buffet. This total fixes and looks cool
B00EI6CKVE|5|Exactly what I was looking for.  Installed in under 5 minutes.  This item comes in 3 pieces:  The blue paper backing, the clear protector over the design, and then the design itself.  Clean the window, pull blue backing off, place sticker where you want it and smooth it on, using both your fingers and maybe a credit card, then slowly pull off the clear protector.  A few times the design started to lift off, but I was able to just smooth it back down over the clear protector and try again.  Came out great!  Side note:  it will fit on the small bottom rear window of a Prius.
B002OUZK7W|4|Nothing fancy and gave me confidence that my travel trailer was protected.
B000CKRWL8|5|Used this on a 7000 mile road trip to keep a Rolla rack in place. Worked perfectly.
B000XEFKEE|4|Great device for preventing door dings. So called security cable is useless. I don't use it. Better to have two pieces separate
B000CMFUK6|5|I pull an 18 foot all steel car hauler with brakes on both axles, hauling a lot of scrap iron and steel and I've had the Hopkins 235 controller on my 99 Suburban for several years now and it works great.
B00317499M|5|Works well,looks good,good price-have it on my bikes,wifes bike and cousins bike-perfict w/iso grips
B00PD6EWPU|5|Very good spark plugs
B002KQ86EY|5|worked great
B0009H51WQ|4|fit good in truck
B0052SF0LO|2|This lightning system does not worth the money.<br />Sometimes the light goes on and sometimes it's not!<br /><br />setting the timer for the light period is not stable, so one time the light goes on for 4 min sometimes for 30 seconds.<br /><br />buy something else, this one is such a poor quality it doesn't worth the money you spend!
B000A0YEIO|5|Put these CURT hitches on our Crown Vics, Taurus, and now my kid's 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix GT1. Jacked the car up and stands, lubed the hangers and pried them off with a block of wood and a pry bar, and tied the exhaust up with a piece of rope. I think it's an oversight that CURT did not put the bolt fish wire in with this kit, because I could not get the bolts and bolt plates down the rail without using one of the bolt fish wires I had saved from another kit. Put a bolt on either side and tightened the hitch up to the frame and marked the bolt holes to drill on the frame. If you're going to use spray paint and a center punch to mark the holes, I'd suggest punching them first, then spraying some paint in the holes to mark them. I sprayed them black and it was a bear to hold the light and punch the centers afterwards. Like the other reviewer says, the frame is tough and the drills like to walk, so make sure you get the pilot hole right or you'll be using the bit to wallow out the hole to fit, unless, of course, you have that large than 1/2 inch bit you found in the bulk trash that someone threw out! Other than fishing the bolts and drilling the bolt holes (a pain!), this hitch installation is rather uneventful. I didn't have to have a second jack to hold the hitch up during installation, and it fit up into the frame pretty easily. The exhaust hangers went back on and didn't have to be replaced like with some of our vehicles, but you might check yours before you get started and get some new ones before you get the thing up on jack stands. To complete the installation I used the CURT Manufacturing 56076 T-Connector that simply plugs into the light system. The CURT guy said to install it completely outside the vehicle and connect the end connector to the hitch with the end cap runner loop, but I cut my lighting rubber grommets on the car wiring and then sealed them back up with liquid neoprene (aka liquid electrical tape) and kept the connector inside the trunk for appearances and to keep it from corroding. Oh, the ball mount. I got the Curt 45024 Class I 1-1/4&#34; Ball Mount but it was probably too close to the car for my taste. I have a utility trailer, so I like it a little further out from the bumper so that I don't jackknife the bed of the trailer into the car, and I have a little more room to make those short radius turns in close quarters. You pretty much have to go to the CURT web site to easily see the ball mount sizes. I think I got the 9&#34; long one, and I should have gotten the longer one (or the longest one). I also got like the 5' rise to keep the trailer tongue and tongue jack from scraping on those speed bumps. Good luck!
B00A6D7T4Q|4|This is my second order.  My children wanted one it reminder them of their father who  had a popeye tattoo he got when he was in the Navy.
B0051326LC|3|I purchased this through LedFoot Racing versus Amazon.  The radiator appears to work well and it also appears to be a quality product.  I installed this radiator in a 1994 Ford F-250 XLT Extended Cab.  It has the 7.3L IDI diesel with a factory turbo (Vin K).  As far as sizing and fit it was a good match.  The radiator installed very smoothly.  I would have the installation the same day It was received; however, the heater hose fitting female connection was incorrectly tapped.  The fitting was tapped as a 16M x 1.5 metric versus 3/8\\"x18 NPT to match the standard Ford heater hose fitting.  I verified this using a 16M x 1.5 bolt which treaded smoothly; whereas, the 3/8\\"x18 NPT Ford fitting would not thread. I have two of the Ford heater hose adapters, one from a 1985 Ford and the other from my 1994, neither fit.  Much of the delay on chasing an an adapter was the wait for their tech support who always seemed to arrive sometime after 1:30 pm PST.  I am on Central time.  The next morning I found a close match locally at Lowes.  Watts LFA-176 which is a 3/8\\" FL x 3/8\\" FIP adaptor that can be found in Lowe's piping area.  It fit tightly with both fittings, but there was no thread damage.  I checked it several times.  Of course, it fit even tighter with teflon tape.<br />An exact adaptor match can be found at threadtoolsupply.com.<br />  I would have rated this much higher, but I had contacted their tech support prior to purchase and they indicated if the size was correct it should work.  Verified the transmission cooler was installed, and \\"my bad\\", I didn't discuss the heater hose fitting.  My assumption that it was advertised to fit my Ford made an *#s! of me.<br />  The folks in sales at Ledfoot are very helpful.  I did get a $15.00 refund for the inconvenience.  However, their tech support appears less knowledgeable about the actual product and provided no assistance in locating the correct adapter.  Additionally the tech support made one condescending comment, \\"most people handle it\\".<br />  With respect to performance my engine does appear to be running cooler.  I judge this by my oil pressure increasing approximately 5 psi which means the oil is cooler.  I monitor temp at my water pump and the useless Ford dummy gauge.  Those temps remained consistent between the old (brass/copper) and the new 3 row aluminum.<br />  So overall I am happy with the product, but I expect little from tech support should a problem develop.
B0047RK746|3|\\"Super White 5 LED Bulb 2x T10 168\\"  I needed a replacement for automatic shifter illumination, Altima GXE 2000.  This bulb fits perfectly in place of an old 194 bulb (even though these LED bulbs are slightly taller than standard 194).  The price is good, and the bulb is bright. However, the color is blue, not white. Blue color fits well with the blue illumination of my Sony stereo, but if you are looking to match the white color of the original bulb, you might be disappointed.  I give 3 stars because the heading specifically says White, which is misleading.
B00CFALFXY|5|Haven't had these long, but so far they work great.  They are a nice size for handling and wringing out.  The edges are sewn well so the cloths should hold up.  FYI:  A follow-up email from the company said to wash in cold water, use no fabric softener or bleach, and to air dry.
B006H852DE|5|Perfect fit for my 2014 Equinox, contains spills and saves carpet.
B00169JV2M|5|I'm very satisfied, my CRV stopped switching 'engine check' alarm in dusty and clay roads, installation very easy! DENSO quality feels really!
B000KDFCJQ|3|I tend to go through sunglasses pretty quickly.  I have an average to wide face, and they fit well.  They are comfortable riding glasses and deflect wind from my eyes very well, but they limit my periphrial vision slightly.  While riding a motorcycle, I need to see everything I can.  Not a bad buy, it's just tough to buy without trying on.
B005HFQRCS|5|nice and thick!...fits great..
B0075XI71O|5|Pleased
B00CYP2GWO|5|Just like most other WeatherTech products, these mats fit perfectly and feel like they will last a long time.  Worth the money..
B0060YHLJ8|4|worked great ..time will tell if they rust.
B009VYWJ0A|5|Good product
B00MGHVRVG|5|does the job
B00AV9NBY2|3|It has a sturdy construction, it is nice and shiny, and it works for its intended use. The only problem I have with it would be I don't think the mounting holes line up properly with my sissy-bar holes, so it sits at an upward angle.
B00H9S71LW|1|The OBDLink is not compatible with the 2014 Prius C.<br /><br />My dash lit up, for the second time, like a christmas tree with every hazard icon possible this morning.  The first time it happened, it was after the dealership closed on a Saturday (July 4th) evening and could not bring the car to the dealership until Monday.  By then the hazards had disappeared.  The service tech said next time the lights come on bring it into the station so they could see the hazards and scan for the code and determine the problem.<br /><br />I brought the car in today, one week later, and that is when the technician found that it is the OBDLink that is the cause of the problem.  Needless to say, I am returning the OBDLink.
B002ZTGLFM|4|Convenient package of fuel line
B001RNOHBC|1|Unit started to power up, sparked, and died. I thought I may have erred on the polarity but I didn't, unit just died. Note that there is no reset or fuse on these so once it dies it's dead. Don't waste your money on this one, buy something better.
B000LKGCG0|5|Great side bag.  I keep items (water bottles) in the bottom bag for fear of getting things wet while going through deep water.  The top portion keeps all your items dry.  Drove around all weekend in the rain with no issues.  I would purchase one again.
B000RI9GJ6|5|GOOD ITEM
B00BD2TVKO|5|Worth every dime I spent. While a bit more expensive than other cushions I've used, this is the best. Comfortable and no sliding around. It stays put and contours to your body. I'm on it 20 hours daily, I should know.
B001OMLEFI|2|This product was a disappointment for the most part. I installed it correctly and found that the side roll bar portion is cut wrong. There is a cut made to accomodate for the seat belt mount and front roll bar but it is about 8 inches away from where it should have been. I had to cut that thing about another 8 inches and then sew the material back together around the roll bar to make it snug. It doesnt look too bad after i modified it.
B00SH1N1A0|3|Will they fit my Yamaha v star six 50
B00877SL2M|5|Cool!
B0055UBVS0|5|It took a bit longer than expected to get here, but it was worth it! It reached the back of my knees in length, which was nice, I could feel it brush against my legs. In the right light it looks blue, but its mainly white. I reccomend this tail for anyone whos looking for a good tail.<br />The only downside is the clip, it easily breaks off if tugged on (I almost lost it on the city transit) but if you have pliers, its an easy fix.
B00029WVII|5|Completely saves my ass on the left side. Installed on Jeep Grand Cherokee 2014<br />buy the small one. Love it
B003AT6EYO|4|The chrome trailer ball that was sent had a 1 inch stud . So instead of sending it back, I just bored out the ball mount to take the 1 inch stud.

B000F15GPI|1|Ordered adash mat for a 94 olds cutlass ciera, received a dash mate for a 02-05 dodge ram truck, sent it back and reordered, received the same wrong mate a second time. But I must be living right. A week later the car was totaled. Don't need it any more.
B000BK543W|5|The XSport cover is all its advertised to be.  It took about 45 minutes to install.  There were very few tools required but you must make sure to follow the directions and center the cover on the bed of the truck.  I have also increased my gas mileage by 1-2 mpg.  Definitely recommend the cover, especially for the price!!
B001879CUS|3|Good but Groits garage product better
B00BGEO7DK|2|I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland 2014 and I feel these mats are small, especially the rear part. Does not cover the floor very well and  they are not  protective enough, however seems to be durable.
B00063Y1F6|5|excellent value
B00K6B4XJ2|4|Works great !!
B001DRNO4I|4|I use Mann on all vehicles, foreign and domestic. I also pair them with full synthetic motor oil Mobil1, Amsoil, Total (elf) and or Motul.
B001Q8DMC8|5|I have a 2012 Camry XLE and this is so perfect for those wheels (and I suppose others).  It's a little thick, so if you have real thin slots or openings in your wheels, it might or might not work.  It's terry cloth, so it should never scratch.  It's not a brush... more like putting a towel over a banana (assuming the banana had a handle)  ... that's actually a pretty good description.  It works great.  I bought three, use them all the time, I toss them into the washing washing with the drying towels when I'm done.  Cheap price and pretty decent quality.  I recommend highly.
B001UE0LLI|4|Truck = 2005 Silverado 1500HD  Front bearing went out at 55k miles, so I decided to replace with American-made Timken.    Assembly was easy (after getting the old off).  Wish the new assembly came with a new dust cap.
B001PDV3AM|1|It broke in a week.
B00513G82U|4|We bought the back storage box and the side boxes in the spring. Due to mechanical issues were not able to get working on the cosmetics until September. When going thru the packing we discovered there were no assembly instruction inside either box. Does anyone have instructions for mounting the back box, and for hooking up the lights on side boxes and also mounting the side boxes? The bike is a 1992 Kawasaki Vulcan 1500 A Model.  I would really appreciate it if someone could send the mounting instructions to my email.  ty  Email is  tavoush@yahoo.com  Also  attached  to Amazon is the email skyraidr@comcast.net  any help would be greatly appreciated.  Kathy and Rich L.
B003HGS49I|5|I got a fully loaded v6 Camry for Christmas and wanted to make sure I did my research to protect the clearcoat.  I bought this wash and a boars hair brush and the day it arrived cleaned my car.  It worked so well, suds were great, and the car was amazingly clean.  To see if it would work on an older car, i used it on my husbands 2005 Honda v6 coupe.  He was skeptical but once we finished he was shocked at how well it worked !!  His car looks as good as the day we bought it after we waxed it....He is a big fan of going to the car wash, this wash did a MUCH better job than they do, and a much better job than the other hand washes we used.
B000BUQOEA|4|I purchased the original filter at a large chain store and it has worked very well providing us good looking and tasting water to our travel trailer. The things that it filters out are far greater than simpler in-line filters, especially giardia. The only problem that I have is getting replacement filter cartridges for it. The original supplier quit carrying these units, so I have had to go on-line to fill my needs. Also, because of the ceramic portion of the filter, it plugs up rather quickly if in well water areas, however, can be cleaned with the provided Scotchbrite pad. I would recommend this product to anyone.
B00080QHMM|5|Although I can't comment on how accurate it is but it is easy to use and it is consistent. I use it every week to monitor the tire pressure of my bike and car. Much easier than the conventional ones.
B003S2E4UE|4|Good stuff:<br />1. Long shelf life, so not a lot of waste from repurchases.<br />2. It sticks to ANYTHING (see also Bad Stuff)<br />3. Dries relatively quickly and hard -- about like a hard plastic, as you can still scrape at it with a razor.<br /><br />Bad stuff:<br />1. Before kneading, it smells like ripe poop.<br />2. It sticks to ANYTHING .. especially fingers, and is a pain to wash off, but eventually does come off.<br />3. Did I mention the smell? OMG What is that?!
B0007TF766|5|I bought this to take the smell out of a new leather purse that must have boxed up in some musty area.  Not only did it soften up the purse but it took out that musty smell.  I'm so pleased since I loved the purse and didn't want to return it.
B000UOCJ14|4|awesome fit.
B000EQCHD8|4|This product came early and as described. I wish the shocks were a bit stiffer, but maybe that's just me and my minivan.
B000CF60BQ|5|Girlfriend has an 03 A4 Avant, these are the only blades I know to work on this car... But they Work! As advertised and cheaper than stores.
B00D6YHZHS|2|Doesnt adhere to all side of the window
B0016IGZ18|5|worked great on my 2008 Chevy silverado 1500 V8 5.3L this was the &#34;cat back&#34; sensor, no more service engine light its been about 7 months with no problems. The heater side of the old sensor was bad but the O2 part was still working so my engine still ran fine.
B00AOCUBJE|1|You get what you pay for!! This stuff is crap! if your bike goes down it will most likely cause more harm than good.<br />The plastic pegs are made out of some cheapass ultra light weight plastic that cant take a 400lb bike.
B003VGOBZ0|5|Great fit and quality construction for the money. Came with headlamps too, which was awesome. Very simple to change out. You'll need a 9/32&#34; socket or wrench for the two screws I believe.
B000C9ISI0|5|My vehicle had a \\"check engine\\" light and the codes indicated this was the failed part. Well, the check valve was what actually failed, but it allowed moisture to enter, and collect in the pump. The light may have signaled the light, but both parts needed replacing. If you get the same code, replace the pump and the check valve. I was pleased with every part of this order. This was not a cheap immitation part.
B00B2I2QN8|5|Fit very well to my Toyota Yaris 2009. And my Toyota looks very beauty. I want to hear more from you!!
B002W2V0FI|5|Nice key chain holder. hasnt faded or anything so looks like it will hold and last a long time -
B008ICDWS4|1|Yes. it is cheap and that is what it is.  It is tinny and cheap material.....  I dont recommend them...
B006XKAEEI|1|to short only 8 inches long needed to be at least 30 inches long
B0057W1W26|2|Love the modern & sleek design, however the claimed &#34;universal fit&#34; wasn't true and I wasn't able to mount on my bike, not to mention the cost of shipping back + restocking fee.  Wish this design came in a smaller size.
B001RM6MN4|5|Do yourself a favor, if you own a Subaru, use NGK plugs and wires. Our cars love them. Great products for sure!
B000WK925W|3|did not fit my head. it seems like it could do its job
B00LO9AG46|1|Piece of junk. Did it work.<br />No stars
B008KZQWRM|5|Just as described worked perfectly! I had no issues with the installation of the previous key fob to this one.
B00009PGNS|5|it is very practice  and  comfort  and  keep  cool  for long  trip  this  my  first  purchase online from amazon  and it  arrive  on time  in los angeles
B00BLAG3D6|4|Great tool. Gets the job done.
B000CCIKL2|5|This is a Professional Grease Gun built like a tank!  The convenient Air-Bleeder Valve makes loading a snap!  Full range lever sensitivity for tight spots!  This is a 30-Year tool; just holding it you can tell that it's very well made and built to last.  Not a Toy!!!!
B00E9ANSGU|4|Very good!!!
B004NPO8LU|3|The oil is good, but the new price makes it no longer worthwhile to buy. Locally available Synthetics can be found for the same price or cheaper.<br /><br />Sorry Texas Tea, you lost a customer. I could understand a price increase, but this is ridiculous.
B000C7S4LS|5|Tank bolted right on, had some issues at first with shipping but the seller helped a lot. Would recommended for anyone with a jeep xj.
B003L8WUBU|5|I THINK THIS IS #5! EXCELLENT STOOL FOR HOMES WITH VERY LITTLE ROOM!!!
B0042A2V88|5|Does exactly what I wanted and expected. The battery seems to be lasting a decent amount of time and has not died yet. It fits well into my car without looking obviously fake and blinks at a rate that is realistic to make it look like there is a real alarm installed.
B003C20USK|4|I like the shield, but it is definitely lighter than the gold presented in the pics. Still cannot clearly see in, and seems to deflect enough sun to keep visibility at good levels during sunny days.
B000N5VXGC|5|YAY!!
B002P8EQA0|5|Put on my 2000 Montana before selling it, great price and great fit.  Wish it came with instructions or I had watch youtube on how to install, I took whole door panel off and that was not needed.  Not products fault :)
B0002L6B1E|4|This shield works great. I only wish it rolled up smaller (although I'm not sure how that would work!).
B00HFK2R8G|1|Item arrived defective. One ballast does not work. Amazon quickly refunded as there is no contact info for this company. Now H13 kit is no longer available.
B001O0YBI2|5|Worked great easy to install!
B00HW1TLYQ|4|Nice micro-fiber cloth for cleaning leather stuff, nice and smooth and no lint! :)<br />I use it with the Honey leather conditioner for glazed leather and the WhooHoo-Clean leather cleaner and conditioner in one for all other smooth leather.<br />But I do find it a bit pricey... just like another reviewer stated, it's nothing really special about this cloth, just a regular micro-fiber cloth.
B00EF64XZI|2|The launch tech easy diag app with generic European or North American EOBD do not work on my 2001 BMW 540i. I am trying to find an alternative app that works with a Bluetooth 4.0 scanner like this one. If I purchase the Chevy or BMW modules, they are $40 a piece which is too pricy for me.
B001GJ3E5C|2|will permanently pill your carpet.  luckily we used on a crummy one we use to wipe our shoes, but the &#34;cleaned&#34; area was left visibly pilled with a very different texture and look than the other area.  use with caution.  not for anything delicate or that you care about
B000CF8W1W|2|The ones they sent me were the wrong ones. I sent them back and the replacements<br />they sent me were for a totally different truck.
B000182F22|5|Quick shipping. .product as described. ..very easy installation. ..fits perfectly
B0000AXQPA|5|Just had this installed with my new boat stereo.  It is well built, low profile and very clean looking.  I am very happy with it.
B00ASN0B1M|5|verry good, this was the correct battery for my Ducati motorcycle. It came fully charged and ready to go. Thanks
B000E5XQDY|5|Follow the instructions, 11/16\\" works just fine.  If you can't find a straight bit, look for a step bit with 11/16\\".  They work great.  They give you objective data on the condition of your air filter. I have filter minders (and K&N Filters) on all my vehicles.
B002R0WZ7M|3|Had a tough time getting this one to fit to the headlamp. It just did not want to clip in all the way. I made it work with some modifications but it would have been nicer if it popped right in.
B00NGT7QI6|5|Fit perfectly on my 2015 polaris mid size 570 ranger.
B000CM2VLC|5|Fits great Thank you
B002YKFA3G|5|This is a good quality remote start switch. It has a comfortable grip and a positive press button, nice 5' long leads which are well insulated, decent spring clips with proper soldered connections, and a red indicator light to show the circuit is hot. The leads are also separate, the switch mechanism I'll bet has a good power rating, and there's even a 'use only in neutral' warning near the button ha. OTC think of everything. This is a high quality tool which should last a very long time when used correctly on starter motor solenoids (don't connect it to ground, or inline between battery and main starter motor terminal, across the battery terminals, etc). Not sure what 'Made in USA with globally sourced components' really means, but I'm pretty sure those components are from China like most everything else OTC. Still a good tool for a good price, so I'm not complaining. A guard for the press button (like Snap-On) would have been nice though.<br /><br />btw. remote starter switches are mostly not used to actually 'start' an engine, but just to crank it over eg. when performing a cylinder compression test. They are not really intended for inching a crankshaft around to set valve clearances (but if that works for you.. fine).<br /><br />Recommended for sure.
B008HZM5SA|5|Really good fit.  Well made brake pads.
B000OUZYAW|5|Very easy to assemble.  Does exactly as it was designed for.
B00180G2OO|5|This is a grease-able MOOG Idler arm, not an injector as pictured.<br /><br />I always have good luck with Moog parts and this Idler Arm is no exception.
B000CP0G1G|1|if you purchase the bully tailgate tr-02wk you dont need it
B00O4Z5XOA|1|It does not fit my truck bed I have a 2008 Dodge Ram 1500 6.4' bed and it's not wide enough
B00CG0IXCE|2|Although the items were in the original packages, they were scratched and the finish was dull. Cute for the price, but I won't buy again.
B00UCECRJG|4|This pulley kits also fits my 2013 impreza sport without any issues. The pulleys are very light compared to stock...Well I only used the alternator and water pump pulley. I already had  Perrin crank pulley, but I refuse to pay over $100 more per pulley. These pulleys fit perfectly without any balance / wobble issues.  The BAD: The water pump and crank pulley belt grooves where damaged and need to be filed smooth. No major issues with that, and it only took me like 10 mins to smooth it out with a dremel and a very steady hand. You're goal is just to remove the burrs from the damaged grooves. This damage seems like a production defect as they came in a super protective foam surround packaging. I believe these are the factory second bests from &#34;Go Bits Fast&#34; pulleys.  So if your okay filing down some damaged grooves (which causes no performance issues or belt squeeks), then these are actually a good purchase. The pulleys themselves made the car seem very peppy. I removed them and put the stock ones back on (had to take care of a oil consumption recall) and the difference was very noticable. Now the oil consumption recall is completed and I have a new engine, I'm off to install these back on the engine NOW!!!! I also saved a ton of money. Oh, they are easy to install as well, just look up torque specs online.
B001RKH7FS|4|A little noisy but she keeps the cans cold
B0006MRQXG|4|Good deal for the price!
B000OKT6DS|4|The only thing I would improve (to make it a 5 star) is the spigot stem/shaft is very thin.  It looks as if it will break easily.  However, so far, it’s worked fine…so maybe my concerns are unfounded
B0007OWD2M|5|If you are a serious detailer of vehicles, this is your product!
B007ZSZ186|4|well, it does what it says. not as blue as I though 8k would be. It's actually white with blue on the edges. Looks great. Worth the price.
B00HWPNSYG|1|It looks great in the picture but when I installed it, this won't fit and appears sloppy, crampled, hooks are no where to be hooked and very thin material. There's nothing to be liked in this product. Money wasted don't buy.
B00CF58BCW|1|The brackets kept going into tire .. the way you have to mount them  really sux ...the screws all came loose  through vibration of riding .....found wire on road to tie them up ..& that was  better than the screws!
B000C5I2YO|5|Such an easy, cheap fix.  The old pad wouldn't stay on and this way perfect.
B00FBKTX66|5|Fits perfectly.  Has suction cups to hold it in place, but they are not needed because it fits so well.  So very happy to have cool leather seats and steering wheel for the first time ever.  No more draping a towel over the steering wheel.  Love this even more than the windshield version.<br /><br />Very happy with the product and the seller's customer service!
B005SEJTUA|5|Great product
B000A09LIW|5|Replaced OEM filters perfectly.  came in a box of two.
B002V97S6C|5|Nice decal. Looks great on my black tank. Went on easy and looks like paint instead of a sticker.
B00GWWVCHU|5|Beautiful addition!
B0029TQDLA|5|product was as described it fits well behind the mirror,it arrived a day ahead of scheduled delivery,good seller to do business.
B004MDEV38|5|works great
B00ECMV2V8|5|really nice suicide knob at a great price will buy again from the company
B002LGYNTU|5|Wonderful experience, love my new set of hubcaps , better than expected, and very cheapy cheap, thanks
B00NLWN8YO|5|Every once in a while you find a great product.  This is one of them.  I am surprised how well these tabs work, I was pretty skeptical at first, but after a week of using it every morning, it works great.  You can see the suds and color when it sprays your window which is encouraging.  I will definitely buy again.
B000PWZR4C|5|My Motorcycle had the wimpest factory horn ever, It was a waste of time to even blow it. I made my own bracket but it looks factory where I mounted it. Make sure to use the provided relay when mounting on a motorcycle and you should be really happy with this product.
B000AP6RFM|5|This is a great air filter and well worth the money.  I've noticed some increase in my gas mileage so that's always great.
B00CNI1SDA|5|Worked well on my brown leather Noconas.  Want to keep them looking like new!
B001CA9CN8|1|Be careful buying this since it is not as described it's a small 3 inch seat filter and does not say air filter anywhere on the package
B0046JX9HW|5|Great product to organize your truck bed. Very versatile.
B002SQHBLA|5|I've been using Mix-i-go for 30 years. Maybe it's a coincidence but I have a lot fewer car and lawn mower problems than my friends. Never had carborator problems since using mix-i-go and now no fuel injector problems. I don't mind buying cheap gas as I know Mix-i-go is in my tank.  I have a 2003 Accord V6 that gets over 34 MPH on the interstate at 70 MPH.
B00B3RCTM6|4|Very nice and durable stickers. Kind of expensive though.
B006RGO8GI|3|Nice vibrant colors
B001PRX7WK|4|It does squeak after using 4 months of use.
B0001EVXFQ|1|Even though it says it'll fit a 2010 Std cab. It doesn't they will send you one for a 2009 even though the 2010 cabs are not the same size.
B001L9XR5O|5|Since my husband is kinda geeky, he asked for this sticker for Christmas.  He loves it and loves the meaning behind it.  Fast shipping and great item.
B00DULV8PC|5|I've bought two. For different cars. Haven't had a problem. Easy to install.
B004VGAJOG|5|Fast delivery n good quality
B00EFDH29U|4|nice product and came as desribed in ad - would buy again.
B00067BVLE|1|Hi, do not put zero stars because there is no such rating so I put a star, I've always bought piaa bulbs, and do not last long, burn, besides talking about this light is not white, it gives a clear amber light, my desepcion was pretty big when I saw them on, I did not like and I lost my money, not recommended if you want white light.<br />Thnak you
B00NON2332|4|Didn't sit 100% flush with my forks but still looks awesome on my bobber
B000SLHRKM|5|Looks great and fits like a champ. Now I have some storage for longer trips. Great product though I'll admit it took a bit to get it on properly.
B005FT41G0|5|Excellent replacement for the dull halogen units on a C6 Corvette. The &#34;projector&#34; style of this light throws the beam out a reasonable distance for the size. That along with the bright white LED result in a significant improvement in rear visibility when backing up at night or in dark garages.<br /><br />... As an added bonus they also look really cool.
B003VC97N0|5|Saves so much time!
B00F3SOK00|4|Decal was made of nice quality, however, was bubbly upon placement (like the other decals from this seller).<br /><br />Material stretches too easy while you work it onto glass, causing the lines to become more rounded.<br /><br />Good quality sticker though, very vibrant white.
B0002SR7TC|4|Great tool for evacuate fluids in all drive units that do not have a drain plug, rear diffs, transaxles, etc.
B004IV58AY|4|Its a great buy, but you have to look up your codes on-line or in a manual , Youtube is a good source also.
B009B42KBI|4|Fit and function are all there.  Can't give five stars until i see how durable they are.  Currently only have 4000 miles on them.  Moog products come highly recommended from the mechanics i speak with, and have been my go-tos for suspension parts for years.  They typically outlast most of my vehicles.
B000C3XDAE|5|This is the right filter for my '83 Camaro, and it came via Amazon Prime. No reason to not buy it along with the oil I like also on Amazon Prime.
B001DRNNYO|5|This works great-I have done struts both ways, and while these cost a lot more, the install is much faster, and safer.  My van has over 200,000 miles, so I figured that everything needed to be replaced.
B0042ZIOYS|5|great for stage work or any other light tying. I had to wright 11 more words to post this. i
B00BSVJ5FQ|3|They meet every expatation. They are great
B001EUJDLM|5|If its Seahawky then I love it, no matter what! and I really love this!
B004LX3AXQ|4|The NOCO genius \\"wicked smart\\" G1100 battery maintainer is excellent.  I have been a Del Tran battery tender plus loyalist for many years.  My last Del Tran stopped working after 10 years and I took a chance on NOCO because my brother-in-law (electrical engineer) recommended it.  Well, I made the right choice.  I had a Harley V-rod that was connected to the Del Tran and the battery died.  A few hours of the NOCO and the bike was back on the road.  I like the percentage charge indicator, options to select the optimal charging situation i.e. cold weather charging, and I can hang it on the wall.  I am extremely happy with my new charger/maintainer.  On a side note, this would not be ideal for charging a car or larger vehicle battery 14 Ah takes up to 8.5 hours. I'll be using this charger for the bike, generator, sled, and lawn mower.  One star deduction because the charger is made in China.
B001TWD5GY|5|I replaced the FF200 lights on my MINI with these. They don't dip down if mechanics slam the hood the way the old lights did and they are a little larger diameter. I spiced them into my existing wiring and they work fine.
B000C18QN0|5|Works perfect in our  '82 Buick Park Avenue.  Large enough,  grips center hump.  Did not have to use double stick tape to secure it.  Takes care of all the clutter.
B005FJ0BRI|5|No reviews had been given for this product, but for the price, and knowing Amazon allows returns, we decided to buy it.  The scanner worked great.  The book that comes with it lists hundreds (perhaps over a thousand) possible scan codes, and this device was able to clear the engine light without a problem.  Definitely worth it for those that work on their own vehicles!
B000PWFJF4|1|This is not a comment on the quality of the product or the effiiciency of the seller.  These mats may be OEM but these are far from the tan color of the BMW mats these are supposed to replace.  These are dark brown.  The stock product picture is not true to the actual color.  Here is an actual image (not unpacked as I plan to return these.  the lighter half of the picture is the original tan mat in my 2001 525i). The color of these mats was absolutely a no-go for me when I have to have these two brown ones in the front and two original tan ones in the back (This product description states that these are only the two mats for the front.  I needed only these two so that part was fine with me).
B00062YWNI|5|I got this to relocate my speedo on my 2009 harley nightster. Fit  little loose but I used electric tape to fill the difference. I also had to widen the mount hole a little. This is a great cheap way to relocate the speedo with little to no work. I highly recommend this.
B001GH1PU0|5|thanks
B00LPU8SJO|5|Excellent quality
B00CFMF7GI|4|Fits perfectly.
B008XN7NUG|5|great scanner, works for most stuff
B000WOCGIS|5|Bought this for my husband.<br /><br />Old one was cloudy and now we can see clearly again..... hmmm, sounds like a song I should write.<br /><br />Fit just like the original. Packaging was well done also to protect it before you install.
B000FVXO1G|5|my distributor loves it.  proper grease to use for distributor cam so worth the investment
B00GX4Y9AY|5|Love this item.  We were able to use it to start our pick-up this winter when the temperature was below zero.
B000CO9YOW|5|I bought this when Amazon had it for under $100, what a deal!!  This thing is freaking heavy duty.... weights as much as a small car!!(not really) lifts pretty good, lowers easily too. I have it sitting in my garage,.....makes swapping out the wheels off my 3 vehicles easy...especially with winter coming.  The only bad thing...if i had to nit pic was moving the thing around and positioning under the car...it's heft makes it a bit cumbersome. I guess I was used to a nice small aluminum jack I used before purchasing this beast.
B000BNS7Y2|5|Great gauge, the bleed function takes a little time to get used to it, but the perfect tire pressure makes the vehicle steering very light and more precise specially during highway driving. I am happy with this gauge
B000C57TUM|5|A+
B007XUHXRS|5|Exact replacement excellent qaulity
B00D99ZWW0|5|Perfect fit, reasonably priced, easy to install.  Look great in the truck!
B000VL2D4O|5|I love this steering wheel cover because I'm a lover of Leopard, it looks and feels good on the wheel and I no longer have to worry about by steering wheel being cold when I get into the car to drive.
B00F1007DO|1|Didn't use it wasn't what I expected and it didn't look right
B004VG0N38|4|I almost use these pads exclusively but i've had problems with the backing melting after the very first use on a light polish and the fibers falling out...So I've found that these pads can be a hit or a miss...<br /><br />For correction ability they are great and it is my goto pad.. I just purchased a Flex 3401 and about to try the 5&#34; Hybird pads...
B00JN0U4SQ|5|Carbon fiber antenna. dynamite antenna .Took me longer to take it out of the box then it did too install. Now when I go through a carwash I don't have to take my antenna off anymore. And the reception with this antenna is a lot better.
B0015PK3AG|5|Great product!!!!
B009E9J2TS|1|Does not always work. I have tried new batteries, it will work for a few days than stop. I have even reprogrammed it.
B001AWK8OK|5|Must have, but now that I have CNC Equipment I'll make my own for WAAAAY Cheaper
B00BAYUI3E|5|Fits perfect in my RAV4 . I love it. It arrived sooner that I expected.yes I will recommend
B008W4MS2Y|4|If you have a slanted antenna, I highly suggest that you use that as a dangler on your mirror. We bought two and lost the first one on it's first trip. Now the second one is smiling from the antenna. Delivery was quick.
B0041MB41M|4|Good fit & quality for my Jeep - 98 ZJ, when I replaced the hub assemblies at the same time as the front axles. Wish I would have realized that these  (720-0009) didn't come with the replacement bolts though. Overall, great product. Not so great product description of included pieces.
B000KKXP20|5|This is a great faceplate. I was worried that it would be off to one side or the other because after market faceplates usually aren't the best fitting. On this one just be sure to have the right side on top, it's not labeled top and bottom but there is a difference. This is very durable plastic and looks great. Recommend.
B000IY9UP4|5|Excellent quality and very strong!
B008B14CGI|4|The construction on this thing is amazing!  It is really a very nice piece.  It is a little bit difficult to get the &#34;cat&#34; bolted on with the position of the flange, but it can be done.  The car does not like the efficiency of the &#34;cat&#34; on this thing, so be ready to do something about the Check Engine Light.
B003E3Q77K|5|Yes I like it
B000C7VY5Q|4|Worked wee - good fit
B00HLSNPE2|5|Presidential
B001AIZ5HY|5|I have always had a lot of faith in 3m products and this one does not disappoint.  After about 8 years, the headlights on my 2004 accord began to have a yellowish tint on them.  A co worker of mines had recommended this and I gave it a try.<br /><br />It was pretty easy to use and the directions were straightforward.  I would recommend using a corded drill as I went through 3 batterys on my cordless drill.  It took about 45 minutes to do both headlights, but would probably take about 30 minutes now that I know how the process goes.  There are several videos on YouTube demonstrating the process.  I watched those before actually starting on my headlights.<br /><br />After using the kit, the difference was like night and day.  What was once a yellow film coated piece of plastic now looked as clear as glass.  Simply amazing.  My headlights were now significantly brighter increasing safety.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone looking to restore their headlights.  It is affordable, easy to use, and works wonders.
B001PNG622|5|Great!...works perfectly for my land rover discovery 1998....really good item,,and very cheap....good product from good brand ngk,,,,,you cant beat the price!
B0001L0DFA|1|I loved this nozzle. I bought it last summer. Went to use it yesterday after not using it during the winter, and it's shooting water from where the black rubber contacts the metal! In other words, it's blowing water back all over me. I guess I just say it was my favorite nozzle ever that I've had but only for 1 year. It'll go in the garbage. I'll just go to Home Depot or Harbor Freight and buy their cheapest one. At least if it only lasts a year, it's only $2 or $3.  This is pretty expensive to have to replace every year.<br /><br />VERY DISAPPOINTED.... wouldn't recommend anyone buy it. On reading today, it seems that everyone has the same problem with the cheap quality and endurance of the product.
B00JQOROIM|4|I received this product for free. Very easy to use, just point and spray. Directions were very clear on use. Smell was pleasing and not too strong.  Worked as the directions on the bottle stated.
B007Y85XLC|4|good price will see how long it last
B000VL6AHU|5|Yes I would buy this again and I have. This is the third time I have purchased this air filter. We have a dog that goes everywhere with us and this cabin air filter does a great job of removing airborne dog hair from the interior of our Toyota Camry. You need to change your cabin air filter every so often anyway, use one that does a great job. This is the one.
B00002N9G1|2|This is as basic a carrier as you can imagine... two hollow metal bars, four plastic feet with rubbers, four nuts and bolts to fasten the feet onto the bars, and four vinyl straps with rubber coated metal hooks to grab the roof edge of the car. I used one of these bars to strap a vinyl luggage pack to the top of my car and it worked fine from Texas through the Rockies into Oregon.   I gave it 2 stars because... the metal clips that grab onto the edge of the roof interrupted the weather seal causing water to leak into the car, plus wind noise (Cavalier owners Beware). I had to send my first order back because the box ripped open and most parts were lost in the mail, when I received my second order all parts were in the box and was undamaged...but, as I easily assembled the feet onto the bars (three holes to choose from to slide the bolts through on each end), The holes on one end did not line up with the holes on the other end. Can you imagine the feet faced in two different directions?! What numb-nut did that? I ended up drilling an extra hole. I DID NOT give it one star because it did its job... I will continue to use it, but not in the rain or on long trips.
B002PQWC30|5|Easily installed and really dressed up the appearance of my 04 Lincoln Navigator.
B001KS2PXQ|4|This replaces the OEM rear wiper blade perfectly on a Toyota 2004 Rav4, JDM right hand drive model. Would be a bit difficult to source here in Trinidad.
B001KS862K|5|Direct fit and replacement for my 2005 GMC 2500 HD sway bar that rusted through. Very easy to change, do not lift the vehicle as you do not want to preload the bar when setting up the links.
B001RAQGXC|5|Works as advertised if used properly.  Removed all scratches from my windshield that were caused by ice scraper last winter.  Like they said, it doesn't remove deep scratches where you can feel the scratch with your finger nail, but I was able to remove 95% of all scratches I had.
B0002T5P2C|5|hold  up very well
B0053UDXXS|4|the two tire chains prevented so much of the slipping and sliding on roads with snow and even black ice
B000E81VN8|5|Bought this for my husband's vehicle...he was thrilled with it!  Keeps grocery bags from tipping over and holds everything neatly in place.  Handy too for tools, sports equipment or whatever you are transporting.  Velcro is positioned conveniently to make several partitions, if desired.  And if ever this unit is not being used, it all folds down flat for easy storage.  A great product to simplify and organize STUFF!
B005XEOLIK|4|I've installed these lights over 5 months ago and they have performed GREAT! No problems, GREAT night time use and VERY Bright! I'm extremely happy with these lights and I'm glad I did it! Thanks!
B00AP2USQE|5|just what I needed
B001EAQTRI|4|used this for a buzzing with my pc speakers, it did mute the issue quite a bit without lowering the sound anywhere else, however it didn't fix the issue entirely.  It's worth a shot, though i'd be curious if i opened the box segment and saw anything there, besides a so-many-ohm resistor or something...
B005R4L1YI|5|Very Sweet, i love the look of them on my rig, i get quite a few compliments, you cant go wrong, bright!
B004QHJO8C|5|everything fit perfect and works as it should and at a great price
B00A3HX7JG|5|great order, everything was as advertised. I'm very happy with what I got.
B00AWPGUSE|4|A little less heavy duty than I thought it'd be. But all in all I'm happy with the purchase. Nice to have straps that match your ski.
B0015GVK8Y|5|Well this thing isn't cheap, but it makes a huge difference in the amount of air buffeting around when the top is down.  It fits great, come off easily when you want it too, and does just exactly what it's designed to you.  I think it looks sharp on the car too.
B0034GX9GY|5|Very comfortable and warm. I am glad I got these.
B00480N18G|5|This is the brightest, whitest halogen I have found. It is an enormous improvement over factory halogens. Though not quite as bright as the hid's on the Lexus, they are great for peace of mind in the Pontiac.
B00I565MOA|5|This is a very nice looking helmet. It fits well and is comfortable. Good visibility. It has a few reflective lines on it, but is not too annoyingly bright. Hopefully we will never have to find out how protective it is! Ride safely!
B00712V1I0|5|looks good
B00K6BJTUU|5|Awesome product. Great company. Fast shipping. Will definitely order again.
B00N0IHMXM|5|saves time works w/my dewalt1/4inch tork-drive
B009DJROLW|1|When I received the hood it was all dented and had creases in it. I looked at the stock at the time and there were no more in stock. I did not feel like dealing with the shipping hassle so I had a body shop fix it up as good as possible. Not happy with this hood.
B002PQMM9E|5|Good value. Fit right in.
B002UC8OEK|5|Replaced my brittle plastic curtain pulls with these. They are tough
B003BZD03K|4|It works as intended.
B0023WCO7K|1|i ordered two of these fog lamps to replace the broken ones in my 97 grand prix gtp, but i was instead sent two replacement fog lamps for a truck.
B004L04TD4|4|These triangles are *very* heavy - they weigh around 4 lbs each.  When I ordered them, I understood that they were weighted and thought that would be a good feature since it would keep them from blowing over in use.  However, since I drive a minivan without a separate trunk compartment, I do not like to carry heavy items in the car unless I can enclose them in a compartment or strap them down somewhere.  (I don't want them to become dangerous projectiles in case of a crash.)  The set of 3 triangles in their box was way too heavy and large for me to feel comfortable putting in my minivan.  I thought that perhaps I could fit one triangle somewhere, but even the individual triangle is quite large (about 18&#34; long even when folded) and I was unable to find a safe and secure spot.  So I am returning these.
B000UJG0LE|5|We have an emergency generator. About twice a year I fill gas cans to have available,<br />just in case. I use the old fuel in our cars. Never a problem running the generator or<br />vehicles. If you have higher than E10 gas switch it out 3 times a years. Sta-bil really works.
B000CQRJ7O|4|I have had problems with brake noise. These brake shoes worked as they should. No  more noise.
B00029XB1Y|5|got it all worked out good
B009B40G4Q|5|classic blue, fixed the ride sway on my yukon
B001JT5JVQ|5|I own a 1982 corvette classic and I am very careful on what I use before I go to shows. This bottle is magic.I have the original paint on the car, after I clay bared it, I went to Track Auto , and bought this product, now I will use it for all my cars. Wish I would have discovered it sooner rather than waste money on other products.
B007CX7B7S|5|Exactly what I looking for very pleased.  Due to my active activities not much time allocated towards getting all peripherals components  installed yet. As far as I can comfortably detect no problems getting satisfaction. Thanks!
B001539B7O|5|So far we really like it.  No heat hardly comes out of this thing.
B001O28622|5|My 70 Mustang Mach 1 has an easier time starting and running with the Street Fire Ignition Box. The ignition has already been upgraded with a Pertronix Ignitor and the instructions are very simple to install.  The adjustable rev limiter is helpful to use at the dragstrip while protecting the engine from blowing up.
B007Z1FSKO|5|great item
B000GTQ6D0|5|EXCELENTE PERFE CTO FAST  A SDD D FD. . . . . . . .  . . . .  . .
B001LHVOVK|5|Although the manual doesn't list every error code they're easy enough to find on line once you get the code.  It was also quite easy to remove the check engine light warning from the car.  This saved us the time and money we would have spent taking it to a car dealer.  It's a great little gadget to have just in case - even if you don't currently have a check engine light.
B009433EK2|5|I had placed an order in  early October that was cancelled a few days later due to out of stock.  Saw it pop up again for sale a few days later, so ordered again as it is the best shipped price I can find by ~$60.  Got it today.  Hood was manufactured in Taiwan and looks good to me.  It was packaged well and has a nice, even coat of primer.  Crossing my fingers fitment won't be an issue.  Will update the review if it is.
B0055QMUTS|5|Put this on my electric golf cart as a joke.But found out it was quite unique,it was a blast to warn people..
B0014H4O8W|3|nice quality, very good price and fast shipping.The only thing is I have to remove my seats to fit them on properly
B0062IJP32|5|yes
B000AM8BLI|5|A+++
B005UTS67U|5|just what I expected! they look nice on my car, thanks. fast shipping
B0002JN2EU|3|My lawn mower picked up power after a few treatment. Worked well enough. I have to see if the mower picks up more power after additional treatments.
B000VQHRCC|5|We use this every time we fill our camper up with well water and it is amazing how it cleans the water and gets rid of the smell. I have gotten 2 and will continue to buy it.
B00BLPT14O|4|Works as well as I expected.
B00BAXNQ1G|5|This is a well made frame.  It looks like the picture and is basically just what it appears to be.  It was a good buy.
B005MVB3S0|5|great tool and fast shipping
B0061F5O3Q|1|Light quite working the first week after  purchased  Zero feed back from there customers  Service!! but looked cool the short time they worked
B004TBAVG4|5|As describe!! Shipping time A+
B000BQYH6Q|3|I like to back my cars in my garage.<br /><br />I have placed these on the floor (I have not screwed them down) and I back my car in until the tires hit the chock.<br /><br />The only reason why I gave it 3 stars as compared to 5 is because they don't really grip the floor. I wish they had some rubber base which would grip the floor well and solve the purpose of a wheel chock when trying to lift the car on a jack.
B0016HPUS8|5|Original part. Once I located where the switch was on my 2005 Hummer H2 it was easy to install. Works great! Great price. I recommend this product and seller.
B00EVDI6TY|4|i think these things are the best. They work perfectly and they were shipped fast. I definitely would recommend these to others. Would be nice if they could make them without the hex
B0002Q8036|5|Shipping fast. Product worked perfectly. In fact we have bought two. One for us and one for our son. Price is excellent. Pay way more in auto store. Great!!!!
B00HRSTNGU|5|Great product. Excellent service from the vendor.
B004CIMX06|3|I never installed this.
B0029XK1VO|5|Good adhesives stayed on nice, easy installation, shows support for your nation and military. I sold it with my car but people respect you if your patched so buy up! Thanks!
B000WK3P46|3|mask fits great!!!!
B004PQL888|5|good excelent product
B004HCM9GK|5|I like the smell and love how it lasts days of shine!!!<br /><br />I recommend this product to my friends and family members, and you can't find it at the stores anymore.
B009DKIQWM|5|Awesome graphic!  I purchased and installed this product over a year ago and it still looks great! It fit perfectly on my Toyota Land Cruiser Prado back window. You can see out from inside just fine day or night but it blocks the light coming in and you cant see in from outside very well.<br /><br />Because I use an automatic car wash often, I was concerned the rotating wash brushes would begin to peel the edges of the graphic off the window so I coated the edges (1/16th of an inch) with some glue (which hopefully will scrape off the glass).
B006B7YOZS|5|Absolutely worth the money. Simple to use plug, set up, unplug, and done. Performance is better.
B003TQ9TOA|2|It did not fit the ACDelco 337-1022 I purchased it for. The bolt holes don't line up. The small bracket on the other side not shown in the picture needs to be reinforced. It's thin and flimsy and would not last for long. For now, it sits.
B0096GLDW8|4|i .plugged it in works well fired right up  great tool for the diy er  plugged it in to my gm vehicle works fine
B000C9C6M4|5|Prefect fit
B0029TQDLA|2|The quality just wasn't there. One lasted less than a week. I would have returned but my daughter threw it away. This is not an item I would ever buy again or recommend to others.
B0092KVYGI|5|they work very well, I got 2 of them they are made well and are almost accurate , only off by 0.2 volts. can not beat the price. I use them on my motorcycles to make sure my charge system is working good and to make sure I have good battery voltage. they work great I leave them plugged in all the time. I would buy more for sure
B008C8WDR0|5|Yesss, works perfect for a scooter. Small motobike
B00EHIPL5A|5|Love it!
B004PMGRBK|4|These pants are great for the price. For me, they were true to size and fit great...very comfortable. Very pleased.
B006V3YJZW|5|Nice product, purchased for a friend's going away party.  Took forever to receive it, past the time I needed it. Kind of disappointing.
B001U23ONM|5|I love this thing on my friends car! its sooo bright at night and i can always find him on the road when he pulls ahead of me. this thing is cheap, but does its job fantastically.
B003GD4FP4|2|it was ok, but it was not reflective, I think too small, but it will be OK used on front door of home, but too small for use on vehiclde
B000KLWFWA|5|I bought the Airaid for my 09 Jeep so that it could breathe better and yes it does now.  Not only better performance but better gas mileage.
B000HM5JP2|5|This is a real chamois.  The fakes do not work like a real chamois.  Well worth the price
B00NT5VDZ4|5|great quality, well made and beautiful!
B003AOGSHC|5|works well  cleans up metal fast and easy to clean off the dirt and such could be a little cheaper
B0083W18IU|5|Fits perfectly and runs like a champ
B000OZVJEC|5|Fits over the bars of my motorcycle well.   NB My bike doesn't have bar mounted mirrors, if yours does you'll need to cut out slots for them and sew the ends. It can also be finished with velcro to close up around the mirror stalks. Overall a nice product and recommended. Tends to resist folding over the levers more than the cheaper variety.
B000BH5MAA|5|Did the trick and quickly leveled my pop up camper.  Wish it came with bag for storage.  Very satisfied overall.
B000B5QFE4|5|Purchasred these mirrors to use pulling my travel trailer and they work great. Easy to put on and take off. No vibration when driving, if they were about 1 or 2 inches wider they would be the perfect towing mirrors.Would definetly recommend to anyone looking for good affordable towing mirrors
B000NWA6TU|4|Fit my Mercruiser 5.3 Liter, 305 V8's
B006MK5RNC|5|Looks great
B0009GZNHA|4|I last replace the Cabin Filter about 20,000 miles ago with this brand of filter and when I checked it recently, it still looked in great shape.  Some people say there is no need to replace these filters, but if you ever look at the black dirt and junk that collects on these, you would change your mind.
B00JJQ8RBA|4|I love this little decal. I haven't put it on my car yet so hopefully it stays in place, for that reason and the fact that it is way smaller then I expected is why it didn't get all 5 stars.
B001VXXUWK|5|This thing is great. I use it for chainsaw carving mostly and some metal grinding. Not flimsy and have not had any fogging . Flips up and has tension adjustment to keep it there. Also crank knob for head fitment is easy even with gloved hands.
B004QEN8LY|5|This item is also compatible with same year dodge Rams.
B000CMJQHY|5|quality product backed by excellent customer service.  the customer service went out of their way to be extra helpful. what more can you ask for?
B00DSLR92A|3|Lacks the zerk grease fitting other brands do, and when I installed it on my 2009 Escape, the clunking and rattling of the front suspension linkage actually got worse, not better. I wouldn't recommend these if you're seeking to quiet that infamous Tribute/Mariner/Escape clunky front end. I used MOOG on my 2002 Mazda Tribute to better effect a few years ago.
B0002UNON8|5|Had an incident in my (white) car where I got a little too close to one of those yellow concrete posts before a security gate badge swipe and zinged the back of my side mirror. Definitely wasn't coming off with soap and water (I tried). Snagged a bottle of this after reading good reviews. Took about 20 minutes of elbow grease, then patient rubbing, and now that oops is a thing of the past. Also great for removing black scuff marks off the doors where people can't keep their shopping carts to themselves. May have gotten lazy and used it to remove some pernicious bug guts that survived all other cleaners, got those too.<br /><br />The guy who wrote that this is a finesse product is absolutely right. It takes patience and finesse, and it isn't a miracle product, but for any sort of paint or other matter transfer that doesn't go all the way through the paint, it gets the job done.
B000Q0P9MS|5|This kit doesn't include the belt, don't forget! (Not much else to say, filler sentence) All parts same or better than OEM.  Includes full tensioner.
B00HV2KIBG|5|Lifted my Tacoma higher than I expected but went smooth def going to have to lift the rear
B00KTIUG5C|2|you have to near the vehicle to use it.
B00DOP54ZO|4|Similar quality to the existing part, good fit and easy to install.
B001UOOY02|5|Really makes the truck look like a new one!  The old lights were very foggy and gave a yellow type of light.  These really updated my truck.  At night, you see so much clearer!
B00EKTI856|4|For sum odd reason I can't open my doors using my car keys. LucklyI have automatic locks.
B0009IQXCM|5|It is easy to apply and it works fine. It gives a great shine to the car. I love it. Recommended to anyone
B003V57NUQ|3|The unit is worth the cost. Had a few issues with putting together that I overcame. After getting together held my Kayak exactly as I expected on my recent first trip using it. Held fast and was secure at 65 MPH with the proper tie downs and straps.
B00OO25M0S|3|Quality so so.
B0089GTC92|5|a very good product
B001O80SVS|5|My fan does not squeal anymore, thanks AC Delco.
B00009RAX7|5|Easy to read display, nice description not just codes. the case is built very well.  I do wish it came with a protective bag but will not mark it down for that.
B001A02BC4|5|fits great!
B004JBJWRS|5|what can i say,,, Its OEM ! Fit and finish is perfect.<br />Update 10/20/2015<br />I installed this regulator and it works great. As I mentioned before, these new window  regulator don't come with the  2ea 6MM nuts that the Chevy part department says their regulatora come with. So he gave me those 2 nuts free of charge. I took them to Loews  to get their correct size 6MM  for those that need them ASAP and reasonable priced.I bought 2 packs they come 4 nuts per pack for a total of a buck and a half,<br /><br />Installed this in my 2006 Chevy Silverado. I was concerned that it wouldn't fit, or that item was a return. I was worried for nothing. it fit perfectly Just Remember to get the two nuts for the bottom. I don't know why its shipped with four new screws, when only two are used for the top pre-mounted screws. it is quick and smooth, raising and lowering the window effortlessly. the motor is sealed, which is definitely a plus. My old window regulator part, after 8 years finally died.(cable actually broke) though I could have purchased an aftermarket unit, their motors aren't sealed, in my opinion, actually slower than AC Delco Version. i WILL DEFINITELY Purchase again, when the others go..<br /><br />I replaced the drivers window in my wife's Dodge 2001 Grand Caravan with a Dor-man Version. Thou it worked, it didn't fit correctly with the door panel's ac duct work. I used a heat gun to make the plastic duct temporary softer, then applied the door panel. Thou it was a simple fix, I didn't want to have to do it again.The dorman window regulator as slower by 3 seconds, which was fine,I was selling the van.<br />on a side note, Dorman does offer a lifetime warranty on their product, but Amazon warranty's-everything they sell for a year.Thats stated on amazon. Being that said, I opted for an ACDelco. Their original, lasted 8 years. if I even get 5, I'm happy
B004GC9QW6|5|Perfect fit at a great price.  My internal hardware was easy to transfer to the new part and functioned properly.  I highly recommend this new part as opposed to finding something from a salvage yard.
B00JHOUC6M|5|Works great. It fit my 2005 silverado stepside perfectly.
B0060EK1GI|5|Great fit and look
B000P6VMEC|5|I looked at a lot of options and reviews and this lock really is the perfect lock for my needs.    My Scooter only weighs about 200 lbs so it's an easy steal...or was.  The length is perfect for finding street signs, etc to attach too.    The Lock is SOLID and a bit hard to get used to at first but still worth it.    Highly recommended.
B009YCP2QM|4|These things are SO bright. Most people would probably complain that it triggers the OBC license plate fault thing to come on but so what? These things are incredible. They don't exactly fit in perfectly since the clip tab things kinda suck but they're held in by the trunk button cover thing anyways.
B000BVB4A8|5|Fine product and a substantial savings over those sold locally. I would buy this again.
B003LUNXQY|1|First i gotta say that the shipping was very quick, so no problem with the seller. I got it and found the instructions only in Chinese but no problem as I understand electronics. I wired this up to power a small relay coil(not even 1 amp)and only to be powered for about two seconds max. Everything worked great for about 10 uses, then my 3 amp fuse blew and that was it. I opened up the box and found a board trace melted. I checked my amperages and found them under 1 amp. I soldered a wire across the melted trace and it worked a couple more times and thats it. Piece of junk.
B000182EZ0|4|Good
B000EAIERW|5|Nice size. Does what it should. Easy to install. Secure it tight or it wont work as well.  Recommend this product.
B00QWBH7DE|4|Theses bulbs were not quite as bright as I expected.
B004ZF3KA8|1|This kit was supposed to be plug and play specifically for my 2010 mini. Unfortunatly after installing my dash gave me error messages for both front head lights. I ended up trashing the 1 cheap relay it came with and putting my own relays and resistors on each side for everything to work properly. This kit is a joke.
B007L6Q1EK|3|This product is sold by subaru which means it's not extra s, I guess extra s in now hard to find! :(
B004EIBXVO|1|Wattage of 410 is way overrated would not run a charger rated at 200w.Bought a 200w i-tec  cup holder inverter for 10 bucks cheaper with a replaceable fuse.Remember 200w less than the schumacher this thing is awesome runs my milwaukee and my dewalt 18v chargers perfectly.Not at the same time of course and all of this threw the lighter plug no messing around switching between cables to hook up directly to the battery. Save your self the hassle if you want an inverter for something other than charging your little gadgets!!!
B005VNWRX4|5|Very easy to install works great!!! Saved me a lot. I was just going to pay someone to do it but you get get tutorials on youtube.
B002QS3F9C|5|Great
B0006O2PBW|5|I bought this as a gift, and the recipient says they love it.
B000FW61SI|5|Just what I needed.  I am constantly dropping things between the seats and they are so hard to retrieve. These have solved this problem. They fit very well and I have used them to hold maps, coupons and letters to be mailed and I'm sure I'll find other uses. A very good buy.
B0016I6F1I|1|I put in my truck- '69 GMC KE2500, and Amazon said this hitch would fit.  I got it and started to mount it and it didn't overlap the frame rails on my truck.  In the fine print the instructions said it wouldn't fit 4X4 with heavy duty suspension.  I guess that's what I have.  Wish I knew it didn't fit before I ordered it.  I had to return it.  I found a 'universal' fit hitch at the local auto parts store and that fit as I could adjust the width of the brackets precisely.  Also- I rated this poorly as when I was torquing the mounting bolts to 90ft-lbs as the instructions said- the fine pitch bolts stripped.  90ft-lbs is apparently too much torque for fine pitch threads.
B002MBEA1K|3|It is really just a hose.  We use it for drinking water and it does a good job. If you are buying it for its no kink properties try another hose.  Have not found any that does not kink.
B0062YZZGW|4|Make sure you know your ordering a silver dacal even though the picturre is white. Other than thast all is well
B00LIXQ7UK|5|Works great, only miles will tell the big story! Shipping was reasonable and a smoking deal.
B001GJ3DZS|4|lets me clean my rims without having to poke my fingers into all the gap areas.  i normally would cut my fingers once in a while, but this brush helps me avoid that scenario.
B00A4G4NXA|5|Good for the price. Nice and sturdy it was not hard to install. Only needed to cut two bolts.
B0012WHBSO|5|Wow! After returning a different brand of air compressor, I ordered this one. This one is so well made and high quality that I am surpised how relatively little it cost.    Con (only one):  * The air pressure gauge shows a value about 5 psi too high while the compressor is running. However, it does show the correct pressure when it isn't turned on, so you can check the real pressure by turning it off every once in a while.    Pros:  * Way quieter than all other compressors I've heard.  * Relatively small, considering its fast speed.  * Fast! It took one of my 265/70R16 truck tires from 19 to 32 psi is just about 2 minutes.  * I like the screw-on connector. It makes it easy and fast to put it on.  * Only a small amount of air escapes when removing the connector, but it is less than with most other compressors. If you can unscrew it quickly, then almost no air escapes.  * Very rugged feel. I feel like I could drop this and nothing would happen to it.  * The power cord is REALLY long. About half the length is all I need, so I keep the other half wound up.  * I was worried about the compressor's high power (12V * 14A = 168W), because my vehicle's accessory power ports say \\"120W Max\\" (even though the ports have a 15A fuse). However, there haven't been any problems on either my car or truck. It is probably a good idea to not have this running at the same time as anything else on the other cigarette lighter/accessory ports (they often all share the same single 15A fuse).
B00J4ZB38U|5|:)
B000RXKR6M|3|Thick, plush, and machine washable.
B0044GNBRK|4|Talk about a pain in the neck to install in my 2003 Ford Explorer Sport Trac.  I had to drill out the old unit before I could even get this one installed. That has nothing to do with the part itself, just be sure you're ready for this install!<br /><br />Part was easy to install, only took about an hour to put it in and hook it up once the old one was removed.  I do feel as though, for my specific installation needs, it was short a bolt or two.  Nothing I couldn't fix with some random nuts/bolts from my workbench.  This item does not come with any instructions whatsoever.<br /><br />Just be ready for lengthy removal of the old OEM part as it may riveted in.  Nothing a good drill and drill bit can't take care of though.  It is a tight fit and I had a hard time getting my bigger-than-normal hands into the holes to work.<br /><br />I've had this part installed for a couple months and its so nice to be able to use my window again, especially in this hot summer!  Definitely recommended!  The only reason I'm not giving to 5 stars is for the lack of any instructions.
B00G620ZVU|5|get what you pay for
B00KF9180W|2|Good, except very thin. Will have to be used as base layer as opposed to what we originally planned.<br /><br />UPDATE as of January 26th: These specific balaclavas were originally purchased for primary use on our scooters; however, they are much too thin for that. Instead, we use our balaclavas everyday as we cycle to and from work. They are GREAT! We are so pleased with them. They are light and breathable and block the wind just enough at the speed we are traveling. They are now the primary thing we use when cycling and no other layers are needed.
B008KPSGB2|3|Nice enough and the color is cute, unfortunately it doesn't work with plates where the stickers sit at the bottom. Pretty much worthless to me.
B0081H7E58|4|fast shipping 4 days.very well made, good casting,  installed it in 20 min. I jacked up the truck from the right side for easy access and no lost of ATF. It did improve the 1-2 shift (chirped the tires in 2nd and harder shift in 3nd) very good servo at a great price.
B00855V2Z4|5|Fits perfectly on my 2001 Acura MDX for the rear liftgate.  I replaced both of the lifts in a few minutes.  It was as simple as using a flat-head screwdriver to pop out the two clips on each of the pistons, pop the old ones out, push the new ones onto the ball-joints.  Package was shipped quickly and arrived in good shape.  Would definitely buy from same vendor again if/when the hood litfs become too worn.
B0006GF5SK|5|I bought this for my husband for the RV he bought and he said that this product works quite well.
B000GZEKNW|5|Just what the car needed.
B000JQQQKS|5|A+
B0002JN2EU|5|As a mechanic, this stuff works great for cleaning out carbs and other fuel systems.
B009HNF8Y4|1|Didn't work out of the box but what do you expect for the price.
B00LDR9L22|3|they both work but not the best quality
B000E3FEU4|5|easy install
B000MD4YKM|4|Works great!  I would give it 5 stars, but I'm just not a 5 star giving kind of person unless an item is extra, extra special!
B00C5SUQ8G|5|Just what I had on the other travel trailer that I sold. I am just keeping the set for further usage.
B0042C5BPQ|5|But after the wear of a car wash, bugs, and rocks it was time to replace the old.  This emblem was easy to replace once I discovered how it was attached.
B001LHVOVK|5|excellent tool for testing ....
B000C53S1G|5|Good buy for my old truck
B00BTSG6L4|5|Bought these as backups for when our other ones lose their charge. They last about 8 hours with three helmets connected for communication. Easy to charge.
B00155237W|3|I though I would like it but dirt gets underneath the shield and you have to take it off to clean it and the plate.
B00ISKYBRM|4|Took one star off for poor instructions.  This Smart Charger works very well, used to charge a 2 bank set of 6 volt T105 batteries, charged in series to make 12volt 225 AH, batteries were a low so set charger too 30amp boost mode and charged for 4 hours, to get batteries up to 90%, then set to 6/2amp rate, to slow charge the rest of the way. Actually thought charger was not working as there is no hmmm from the charger, as when it is set to the higher rate. But since the rate of charge was sensed by the charger to be over 85%, it automatically went into slow rate trickle charge. Since this is a very slow rate charge, and the Battery bank capacity relatively high it took a couple of days for the charger to get the batteries up to 100%. Then it automatically went into maintenance/float charge mode. I had to figure most of this out myself, because the very poor documentation, does not explain anything other than the most rudimentary applications. If using this charger with a generator, make sure it is a &#34;inverter&#34; type generator, a regular generator provides dirty power and will cause the charger to overheat and eventually fail.
B000CMKESE|5|Easy to install and fit well.  Stops mud and dirt pretty well.  I would recommend these flaps to others.  Bought rear flaps as well.
B0085OMPQ0|5|my name is Geanett tarver
B005O4SMHA|5|great design. pretty color and shipped quick, will def be ordering from you guys again if needed! thanks again :)
B0088UZH0W|3|I thought is was going to be bigger plus I ordered black(duh) try seeing that with tinted windows. My mistake.
B0002U2V1Y|5|I'm about as big of a skeptic as there is, especially when it comes to car detailing products, so when I first heard about clay bars, I thought it was a joke, and they would either damage the finish or do nothing at all.  And no matter what, it would be a royal pain to do.  I also figured the chances of dropping the bar, especially for me, would be around 100%, which requires throwing it away.  But there were so many good reviews, and it was being offered at a discount, I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />By now you can probably tell where I'm going with this.  It turned out all my assumptions were wrong.  This stuff is pretty amazing.  I washed my car, tore off half a bar, flattened it out, sprayed the lubricant over a small area (which I suspect is just cinnamon-scented water), and went to town.  There's virtually no friction so it's incredibly fast and easy to do.  It feels like sliding an ice cube over the surface of the car.  In fact, it's so slippery, it felt like I wasn't accomplishing anything, but when I looked at the clay bar, there was a bunch of gunk stuck in it.  But the real results become apparent when you rub your hand over the treated paint surface and then the untreated surface.  The treated areas feel like glass and the untreated surfaces feel dirty, even though the car was just washed.  When I wiped the lubricant off with the included microfiber towel, there's no signs of paint damage like you'd get with a rubbing compound and there's virtually no chance of dropping the clay bar since it stuck to my hand like tape.<br /><br />So, bottom line, if you are the type of person that goes to any effort beyond washing your car to make it look good, you should definitely consider using this stuff.
B001DBXQA6|4|The Spectre air filters are almost identical to K&N air filters at half the price.  I bought two.  The same filter is suppose to fit my Infiniti FX and My Nissan Maxima.  It fit the Fx but it would not fit the Maxima.  The car does appear to breath better and accellerate quicker.  There is a noticable increase in the exhaust sound.  I would chose Spectra over K&N again.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Very light but fits firmly against the wheels.  I had used boards in the past and had my camper move a couple of times.  I don't see how it can move with these.
B00076QA4C|5|Exactly what I wanted.  Good  quality.Just looking for plastic hooks to use on my hinges in the back of my car.
B00CMX20H4|4|This is a decent Horn, its big though...you must buy something like the Deluxe Wiring Kit for Stebel Nautilus Compact Air Horns<br />Sold by: BikerHiway $15.00, unless you want to go buy some wire and connectors and relay separately.<br /><br />I put this on a 2012 Harley Davidson Heritage Soft tail Classic.<br /><br />The mount sucks, had to fabricate a bracket to mount this to where my existing horn was. this took more time than anything else,<br />Using the wiring kit, which had the relay and all the wires and connectors, see my comments there about the kits, it doesn't have extra connectors, so if you screw up you gotta head to the store.<br /><br />But once i had the mount ready it took less than 30 mins to wire, only had to take off my seat to get to the battery area, relay and fuse from the kit fits under the seat just fine.<br />Fished the wires through the existing conduit under my tank. Kits wires are long enough to run from the horn to the battery area.<br /><br />One thing though... on your old horn make the cuts right at the horn, you will need your old wires, they connect to the relay that comes in the kit. had to splice a white wire from the kit to the black wire of my old horn, this was the wire that came from the horn button. but the kit came with connectors to do this. so it worked fine.<br /><br />The diagram is pretty crappy on how to wire.. but there is a lot out on google, its not hard.<br />Wouldn't recommend for anyone who has never worked with wiring electric items though.
B0024E6V30|5|These flters fit perfectly in my LG refrig no leaks and the water tastes great
B006JYNEEK|5|Great gun. sprays just as good if not better than my SATA 3000 RP.  It is noticably lighter than my SATAs which make large jobs<br />easier.  Gun setting are different than SATA.  Uses alot less air pressure.  I spray around 20 pounds for base and clear.  fluid control is about the same,  2 turns out for base, 4 turns out for clear.
B00MV4QVWE|1|Bad idea, attaching a charger to wheel while your driving.  Also has a chemical smell that will give you a headache.
B00LLKQXA4|5|Love it and it looks great, functional too.
B000ALDY6G|5|Color match perfectly.  Applies easily per directions.  Very satsified with this touch-up paint.
B008M22FLK|5|Bought and installed a year ago in my f150. The mats and the trucks carpet still look like new.  Highly recomend
B0002UEOPA|5|Used it to make a good seal between exhaust pipes along with gaskets. Worked great. Allow to fully cure or else the car will be smoky, but don't panic. IT's just the RTV burning
B00397WE0A|1|Well, certainly not what I was expecting.  What I received stuffed into a plain white mailing envelope looked like a pile of cutoffs from under my table saw.<br /><br />Literally I think they took a 2x10 about 12 inches long and ripped it repeatedly into 1/8 inch strips then dumped them into an envelope.  There's no sanded or rounded edges, there's no markings on the sticks.<br /><br />I guess what I expected was something close to what I get at the paint store.  This wasn't that.  I suppose they'll stir paint, but it's kinda strange...
B000UJ7FR2|3|Works &#34;okay&#34; the one or 2 times I pulled it off the stem and there was actually a reading - but was it any good? I have no idea - that is what the gauge was supposed to be for. I am very mechanically &#34;able&#34; and work on electronics to bikes, motorcycles and automotive but maybe I am simply not doing &#34;something&#34; correct. Although really there is only one way to use it :D it's an air gauge after-all.<br /><br />The one possibility is that I have threaded vs. smooth stems on my road bike and mountain bike so maybe that is making it more difficult to use to push down enough to release air to measure the pressure. I guess I will just add this to one of my overflowing tool chests and more than likely never use it unless I change my stems and find that was the problem. I have watched YouTube videos of people using it so it does work, it's just not that intuitive and there are no instructions or documentation.<br /><br />I will end up relying on my pumps gauge unfortunately as I have in the past. My hope was to use this to check my pressures daily before I go on my ride vs. pulling out my full size pump to use it's gauge. Would have been nice to have this when out in the middle of nowhere on my mountain bike as well and need to make adjustments based on terrain.<br /><br />Based on my experience and even though the tool seems well built and has several functions (again no documentation to go over them no matter how difficult or easy or feature packed).<br /><br />Based on my experience I would not recommend this product. I will update this review if my opinion or use of the tool changes.
B0088BX0IM|5|ok
B008MZ02DA|5|Looks great
B001O0TVSW|5|Exact fit for my vehicle.  Well made and a great price.
B0000AY3SR|2|Your experience may vary, but even though I followed the instructions on the bottle, I did not see any difference in the headlight on my 2006 Mazda 3.<br /><br />I am a fan of Meguiar's products but cannot recommend this one.
B0089LXZOU|1|The tank broke less than year.
B000637TNM|4|Applied Lexol liberally to old tan leather sofa. Conditioner darkened leather somewhat which was fine and restored leather suppleness.  Good product.
B001OMKH7Y|5|The Accel Stoplight Switch worked great on my 1991 sportster xlh, with no problems at all.  So...if you need a stoplight switch, this should do the trick!    Works with a lot of Harley makes.
B001445IZ8|2|The suction does not work good.
B00H9T3X3G|5|Great stuff. Lowered my oil temperatures and increased my gas mileage.
B00DUM18EM|5|Just as described. Brand new oem.  Plug and play. Super easy  to install. Truck was pre wired. Fast shipping. Thanks.
B000VSONRC|4|Good so you won't have to put your dog inside the car while going somewhere.
B00407YRGM|1|As you can see the color on the can top is silver<br />but as the description says Exact match Spruce Green.<br />So I bought this item thinking that the picture was wrong or a stock pic<br />Sorry to say that it is silver paint that is a far cry from the original color.[[ASIN:B00407YRGM Dupli-Color BFM0362 Spruce Green Ford Exact-Match Automotive Paint - 8 oz.

B000Z0HVHA|5|Good quality construction. Stands up to heavy use when camping. Purchased for more DC power options. Would buy again and recommend.
B000FJQWXU|2|Bought the gauge as tri set. Stopped working.  Started reading  50% too cold.  Replacing it in lieu of the whole set in just about a year of use.  Disappointed.
B00CDAFT6K|5|This is easy to apply to the rear side windows for the dog's comfort.  The suction cups easily go on and can be easily taken off.  The sun shade has stayed up no problem.  The sun shades are see through so they don't bother your driving, yet they provide good shade from the hot sun.  Best of both worlds.
B0000AX5XB|5|Nice bag and inexpensive.  My Gmax GM52S Helmet (XL) fits in the bag with plenty of room to spare.<br /><br />It is lined with a soft material that looks like &#34;wool&#34;.<br /><br />And I like the handles on top.<br /><br />Much better than a really thin drawstring &#34;freebie&#34; that most helmets come with.
B001CEG90I|5|This fits perfectly on my Lexus IS 350. I can feel the difference in the air quality now and feels god to have saved $50+ compared to dealer.
B0043WOEJE|5|fixed the other half problem thanks
B000UVCK9S|5|I have purchased 3 of these in the past year. I put these in my truck and they look really nice I like that the can light with the music or any of the other settings and they light up the floor of the vehicle nicely. My stepchildren love them so I bought a set for each of their vehicles as well. I reccomend these the a great deal at a great price. They did go up a little in price since I bought them but what hasnt they are still at a decent price.
B00WYI9SUO|4|Great for the price. Order one size bigger then what you need and its perfect
B000RMGSPM|4|Good product.
B001LY1KP8|1|I was so excited to get these graphics for my 04 STI. I emailed about getting the graphics in bright neon green before I bought the product they said they could do it and that they could match my rims in the pictures that I sent them. The shipping was fast but the color was so far off from neon green it came out to a candy apple green or a Kawasaki green like old school Kawasaki green. emailed them about that the greens didn't match or even close to matching and if there was a way to send them back for a neon green. I was told that it was the closest green they had and that once they are cut no refunds. So as of now I'm stuck with some graphics that won't be used on my car and out of 100 bucks with no refund. Buyer beware make sure they actually have the colors your looking for before you slap down the cash.
B000E7H3QS|3|The sock went on OK and seems to keep the grit out of the filter (and out of my MAF, more importantly).  But it is pretty fragile stuff, and any rubbing on the sock will wear through it in no time.  I think the ends of the sock should be of sturdier material, hence the three-star rating.
B00AOIM2CC|1|First off, the unit arrived in a thin Tyvek envelope with no protective padding from JR Rowling Electronics LLC.  That's no way to ship an electronic part in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Second, When I installed it in my 2000 Toyota Tundra it caused the airbag light to come on and stay on even with the vehicle powered off.  I have no idea if the unit was defectively manufactured or damaged in transit or simply does not work properly with my vehicle.  Given the other glowing reviews, I would have to surmise damaged in transit.<br /><br />Third, the Seller was kind enough to authorize the return of a defective product AT MY EXPENSE.  The $2.50 shipping isn't the end of the world; it's the principle that a defective product, possibly/probably damaged due to improper packing, costs me anything out of pocket.  Live and learn.<br /><br />*****UPDATE*****<br /><br />Seller has stepped up and issued a refund for the shipping charges.  Much appreciated!<br /><br />*****UPDATE 2*****<br /><br />Should have known...the shipping refund was deducted from the overall price.  Thus, I have been refunded the purchase price but not the shipping.  Buy from someone else!
B001JK0Z28|5|Used this to replace an insert on a jetski...Really high quality set, nicely packaged too. The replacement went perfectly and was far easier than i expected. Expensive, yes, but you get what you pay for.
B00FEXAY8Q|5|Bought the product, came in within a reasonable time. Well I will agree fitment isn't perfect, took 15 minutes doing some little adjustments with a Dremel and three test fits, it is perfect 6 months later with no issues. If you want a product that is durable and gives your e36 a sportier front end this is for you. If you expect it to fit perfectly first try, don't bother if you aren't inclined with cars or making small adjustments.
B001AWQYCU|5|it is very useful .. i bought 4 of this product to my 4x4 family's car :)    Thanks.
B001B4I6A0|4|This makes leveling our camper ten times easier. Flashes green when level and red when unlevel, the lights show you which way it needs to tilt.
B008KY5ULW|5|Works great, easy to read even in near full sunglight
B0041PW5K8|5|Anything RSD makes is top of the line and this gas cap is not short of beautiful craftsmanship
B0006IX7WY|4|I purchased this bar to help keep the food in my frig where it should be and it is doing the job.  Sometimes the road is rough and bumpy and since I got my Camco bar when I get where i am going and open my frig the food stay's where it should and does not fall all over.
B005EJGSQ2|4|Comfortable, easy to use.
B007Q6JKMU|5|Easy to apply. Looks grewt. Priced right especially for 2. I've already received compliments on them. Wish othet colors were available.
B00230EM90|5|My Bandit is 'bone stock' and this filter was a perfect fit for such a setup. Gonna install at next oil change. Thanks.  :-)
B001H8CTEE|5|Busted tank on my old one, needed a new one, didnt want an aftermarket one.  This one is excellent, came with adapters for the oil cooler lines in case they are different, mine didnt need them........  Very good radiator.  Working well in my truck.
B00062YJU4|2|it says it fit ford mustang gt 2004 OM set up ,<br /> but it dose not at all , i had to make adaptors to mak it fit some how
B0009IK7YC|5|Consistently good quality and a great price on amazon.com You can't go wrong stocking up on popular oxygen sensor numbers when they get so much more at the auto parts store.
B000C7ZDWG|5|Had it overnighted with amazon prime. Arrived exactly as pictured. As with most combination switches, it was a bit of a tricky install, but it worked great once it was in. I work at a shop, and we always use either standard or AC Delco parts.
B009F10S3Y|5|Easy to install, holds well, and looks good! Will be buying the side and back skirts as well.
B00BXIG01G|5|The tire fit perfectly and the instruction were great,  glad to know I will have a spare when I need it
B00D7646L8|3|let's talk about the things i like about this particular switch first: 1. shipping is a month faster than indicated, and it showed up unexpectedly as i was expecting it to come in mid june, but it showed up just 2 weeks after i ordered it, and 2. the installation is easy, simple plug and play, no rocket science involved and the auto function works very well.<br /><br />i'd give it a 5 star if i didn't come across the following problems: 1. there's no light sensitivity adjustment while the product description says there is, which is a bummer for me because i'd really want to adjust the sensitivity so that my xeons don't come on when im under the bridge or freeway overpass, and 2. the coming home and leaving home functions don't work. I've vagcom my 2013 mk6 gti for coming home and leaving home to work, and i was expecting both functions to work with this switch and sensor, but they don't.<br /><br />also, when in &#34;auto&#34; mode, you can't turn on the foglights, you have to set it at the position between auto and parking light to turn on the headlights with fog lights. that is ok with me i guess, it just doesn't look as good.<br /><br />i'd totally give it a 5 for the fast shipping and easy installation, but the lack of light sensitivity adjustment and ch/ lh function toggle switches made me slightly unhappy with the switch and hence, a 3.
B000J46PTW|4|This product performs as designed.  Could not find a similar product that would fit the windshield size of the CX-7 and mazda discontinued the item.  Would have given 5 stars but the product is slightly high priced and to fit the windshield, it is extremely large and cumbersome to unfurl and install then remove, roll up and stow away.
B00IUAQ1Y6|5|Great item delivered right on point. Well worth the buy
B000A8MPQO|2|I bought these seat covers on 6/30/09 for my jeep. I am writing this review on 8/29/09, just less than 2 months later. Out of the box i was thrilled. Then the fist problem. The plastic clip that holds the bottom cover tight just snapped. No big deal, easy fix.    Now for the problems i cant fix.    I can already see the purple haze starting where the sun is bleaching the black out out of the fabric. I live in IL, not a sunshine state. I also have the top up with usually the doors off. They really never just sit out baking in the sun.    Next problem i have is the biggest. They fit perfectly. Snug but not too snug. But after this 2 months i can see he seams on the back of the seat are stretched and pulling the threads through. eventually they are just going to tear at the seams. not too surprisingly now i have the same problem on the front. On the drivers side seat right on the face of the upper it has started the same stretching at the seams. Now it looks like a 6 inch long area that someone stretched panty hose over because the material under the top layer tore away and left the thin top layer the only thing holding the seam.    Understand please, I am not trying to beat up on the seller. I knew what i was getting into with a cheap neoprene seat cover. Thats why he got 2 stars. I just expected at least a year out of them. I may not get 6 months.
B000EGAM0I|5|Fast delivery, great product, will buy again soon
B008U1MOM8|5|Works as advetised. Flawless communication with Torque Pro app using an android phone.
B00HVJ899C|4|The cushion is great!  The only problem is that it does not allow the airbag sensors to work correctly.
B000C5I72G|5|Hubby installed in about 5 minutes, been working wonderfully.  Not flimsy at all, nice to have my tail gate open again!
B001U7MWKI|5|Great steps lightweight seem to be plenty strong for average size adults I did not permanently mount this to my camper I just fitted the mounts to wood and it fit between the camper and tailgate.
B00GUPMHWI|4|When we put the house up for sale, we were told we had a &#34;dog smell&#34;.  Found out the cleaning lady wasn't changing the vacuum bags as often as she should have.  We used quite a bit of Ozium around the house before every showing.  I don't like heavy scents and this just smells clean.  It doesn't last very long in the air and maybe it's not suppose to since it isn't meant to mask odors, but to eliminate them.
B0056YR3KA|5|These pads are recommended by Happy-Trail.com in Boise. They have many years of experience with the Kawasaki KLR 650. I can not comment if these are good brake pads for other motorcycles.<br /><br />Free shipping, and a competitive price made these a great deal.
B0027V0UQ4|1|BMW does not offer remote starting as a feature.  This clearly cannot be \\"OEM\\" since the OEM does not offer it.    This is clearly a third-party product.
B00GI77IEA|5|Popped this into the tail light of my 2005 Hyundai Accent with no problems.  Seems as bright as the last brake light.  Would buy again, assuming it does end up lasting a long time.
B000C2SBUM|5|No problems.
B0006IX7TW|4|I was told about this item from other RV users.  I figured that it can't hurt but I was suprised when I found that items that were cold in one part of the refrigerator were not as cold or frozen in other parts of the frige.  Now it seems that I have even temperature through out the frige and I was able to lower the cold setting and still get the same results.  Easy item to use and it came with a charcoal filter that leaves the frige with no unusual smells. [[ASIN:B0006IX7TW Camco 44123 RV Fridge Airator]]
B002799D28|5|Get a manual for your car before you order parts. This is a OIL LEVEL sensors NOT a temp sensor for those who don't know #@$ about cars.
B001LHVOVK|1|wasted at least two weeks and still looking for a code reader, this P.O. S. never worked at all, sure the light came on, but no characters ever appeared, now ill never buy anything with  autel labeled on it, come on amazon, quit selling crap!
B002FOO884|5|Great way to buy plugs online.  Saves time in the store and money ultimately.  Gives you more time to actually work on the car!
B00V5BTCYI|5|Good stuff, water beads right off
B004NL0XHW|1|Be aware these are California  emission  cans so you will need the adapter or in my case i used a side tap.
B006BDW0G2|5|I had the key cut and followed the directions....and  now I got a new key frickin awesome:) I love it:)
B0009VIQ1A|5|Given the constant dust where I live, I would have to wash my car once a week, or every other week at the most.  Instead, every couple of days I run the duster over my car.  Most of the time now I only wash my car once every couple of months, unless it rains.  It is easy to care for and does a good job.  I would recommend this!
B00O7XYRQO|5|My daughter feels more confident! She is no longer worried about drivers tailgating and blowing at us because she is still learning.
B000JWO6QS|5|Just what the doctor ordered
B00KZD8ME8|5|Looks great an took literally under one minute to install them both :)
B0050LU2GQ|5|perfect easy to use no hassel
B005PZKPMS|4|Looks great on the back of my helmet and is decently reflective. Be sure to peel the backing a little at a time, sticking as you go.  Once this is on, it's staying there....
B000R8AEF6|5|good.
B002W8GGI8|5|This is an excellent plug for my Passat with ATQ engine. I've stayed with these plugs for 15 years and never a problem.
B007ZGBLNW|5|Super bright and amazing value. Low current draw so go crazy buy a few extra and spares for the trail.
B000CMJRDC|5|I ordered both front and back and like the way they look, but especially how they keep everything off the carpet.  Just bought more for my Nissan pickup.
B006E4KG5U|5|bright was good and color was white and not blue good for the bath and bed room in my rv
B000C01CK0|4|great price, and it works.<br />Made in the USA
B00B5ZYY38|5|worked great
B000KEJX5E|5|A quality item. It is 54&#34; wide rather than the 58&#34; claimed in the description. I added extra grommets on the sides to use it as a single bivouac shelter, for which it works well. Glad to have found this item. Decent price, also.
B00F8HKU14|5|very good decals.  from pictures of all of the available buckeye stickers, it is hard to see which ones are really good and which are the knockoffs.  these are great!  permanent, dark green leaves, excellent quality.  highly recommend.
B001FBUP8A|5|I purchased this chain lube for a go cart chain and it works great. I would purchase again when needed
B001U6DMSK|3|Kinda thin.  I can see this thing tearing soon...  But for the price....
B003UHNMMS|5|Great quality, especially for 7$
B00877DBKY|5|Perfect, and on time..... :)
B000HBGHXQ|5|Had trouble tracking down a good contact cleaner locally.  This stuff works well, though it is a little pricey.
B00KTI9UQ8|5|Super easy to program and works just like OEM remote on my 2006 Silverado 1500.
B005DMD01G|3|They went on and were tight at first, but after riding a while they began to shake and turn as we rode the bike. Turned out the threads got worn quickly from riding.
B004OFPFUW|4|These aren't the most high quality shades in the world, but for the price they do the job and manage to keep the sun out well enough.
B00029JYS8|5|Nice tac just what I needed... the leads are a bit short for my bug but it was easy to just add more wire to run to the rear
B001GRW21G|5|Perfect fit. Were a little expensive but made very good and made in United States!!!Thats why I bought this brand.I would buy again and recommend to friends.
B0024ECHII|5|had to do a little modifying to make it work but the support it gave is great. i had to cut one of the ends of the feet so it would fold up and set flat when stored.
B00DAXGNKA|1|Didn't work for my Eton Beamer at all! It would start it and die and seemed like the spark plug fouled! I wouldn't recommend this for anyone at all! Completely disappointed! They did send me another one to try and it did the same thing! Thanks anyway but I would waste my time or money!
B007HRPR3E|5|ordered as a replacement part and was suprised by the fast service and it fit perfect in water heater works like a charm not problem with the seller and recieved item faster that delivery date set on order A+++ service
B001KQ9L12|1|Not entirely Dorman's fault - Ford's design of this handle seems inherently weak. There are too many built-in stress points. What is Dorman's fault is that this part is even less rigid than the original Ford part. But the main problem with this specific item is that the yellow clip that attaches to the metal rod keeps coming out of the handle. It is poorly designed to stay in there.
B000COBLJI|5|When I crank up the high beams, these bulbs put out a lot of light. Saved me the expense of a set of fancy drivers. I replaced the original wimpy sealed beams with a halogen kit, made of metal and glass. I can't wait for winter so I can see what they do in the dark. It's summer here in Alaska, and the sun is up around the clock. These should be great for keeping moose out of my jeep.
B000IE0EZO|5|Disappointed in this, so cheap, directions were written in 5 languages - none of which was English.  I tried to figure it out from the diagrams but the first thing I tried to do was pull out the clip that exposes the \\"cutter\\" that you would use to cut the seat belt in an emergency.  Could never get it pulled out - so it would not help me if I was hurt in a car crash or otherwise.  Very disappointing...<br /><br />IMPORTANT UPDATE TO ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After writing this review I received an email from the Director of Operations for the Resqme Company asking me to call him and I did.  I explained the problem I had with the product. He said that normally English instructions are included with the product and I should have received that.  He was worried that maybe I had not received the \\"genuine\\" tool.  He kindly offered to send me another and then asked me to call him when I received it and he would go over with me personally how to use the product.  I did receive another product and a business card and pamphlet from this gentleman.  Let me say that the reason I was willing to do this was because I was so impressed with the Director of Operations, that he would take the time the trouble to do this told me that he obviously believed very strongly in his product.  I sat down to check out the new tool I received and this time I was able to pull out the clip that cover the cutting tool, yay, I was excited.  Then when I pulled out the instructions they were in several foreign languages, none of which was English so I still could not figure out how the glass breaking part of the tool worked.  I did see on these instructions however the Resqme.com web site and decided to look at that before calling him.  And there on the web site was a little video which demonstrated every aspect of this tool.  I then saw it was just a matter of pushing the end against the glass which caused the pointed piece inside to push out and break the glass.  Because I could not read the foreign language instructions I kept thinking there was something I was supposed to do manually to release that and I just couldn't figure out how to do it.  I then took a piece of cardboard, placed it on the floor, pushed in and voila...there was a hole in the cardboard!  As it turned out, this tool works perfectly!  Thank you Mr. Duval for not giving up until I was able to see just how well your product works!<br /><br />PS  Maybe you could somehow post the video demonstration on Amazon's order page for those people that don't receive the English instructions?
B0010E3IUY|5|Great air filter, will buy again.
B000CFAV8Y|1|Had to return them they were the wrong size
B002K66FYW|5|Looking good on 2003 SL500 and 2005 CLK500. Bang for buck deal!
B007RHX010|5|As Advertised.  Genuine OEM BMW Drain Plugs.  If you're a first time BMW oil changer don't worry that no sealing washer came with these.  BMW filters ALL come with a new drain plug washer.  I wish American cars were that way.
B000C5DUN2|5|After reading all of the other reviews on this product, I ordered hoping it really would work & be as easy to install as stated. I was NOT disappointed. The ON buttom cover on my 2002 Ford Explorer Sport Trac had cracked and finally totally disintegrated. My local Ford dealership wanted $123.00 plus labor to install. My husband & son assured me they could do this, so I ordered this replacement. My son installed in about 10 minutes!! He just used the new switches on my old cables and everything works great! Order with confidence that these will work & are easy to install!
B00192QB9M|5|plug is well built and is very handy with handle ,other brands of plugs locally  were a lot more money easy to attach and secure wires
B00SAAW8Y8|5|Very good product, easy to use!
B003V9L05G|4|Have not had a chance to use this item, but sure it will work well. This product was a great buy.
B0009V1WS4|5|So far so good
B00EGFO33U|3|I have a 2015 Audi A6 with the S Line sport package. The frame is of adequate quality, however I believe a slightly thicker gauge metal should have been used to minimize the dimpling that occurs at the bolt holes when the bolts are snugged down. If the bolts were left any looser, I would be concerned that road vibrations would eventually loosen them completely. The frame otherwise looks fine with a nice chrome finish and S Line emblem. So I'm not unhappy with the product, I was just hoping for something a bit better.
B009KW82CC|5|Really cool little keychain. Wish they had a full mini turbo that worked. When someone does make that I'll buy it :)
B00KVOOIMQ|2|While most of the keys are working, I have one key that will not accept programming to my 2006 Jeep Wrangler vehicle. I would like to have the key replaced or have a service person who can correct the problem contact me.
B0064GLSHI|3|OK
B001IZIFJO|3|this thing was a beast to install.  The description indicated it would work with a fifth wheel and I assumed it was made for a fifth wheel.  WRONG.  It's &#34;universal&#34;.  It took my husband and I two hours to put this thing on.  We had to monkey around with the straps on the front.  The fifth wheel pictured looks so neat and orderly.  Ours looks like a three year old did it.  We had to gather all the excess material and use bungee straps to hold it.  All in all the quality appears to be as described.
B006X98A7C|5|Works great... even lost power after i got it and my computer and 2 screens where still on.
B003O0YM0W|5|Work great!!!
B004NYJPXW|5|they worked out perfect couldn't of got a better fit
B002R4CNZC|4|Great quality from Simpson as always.....
B00ONGSXO2|5|this fan works great. I was afraid it would be a cheap imitation however, it functions like a brand new item from the factory.
B004Y3UUG8|5|Everything seems good I installed it on a DSM transmission because it has a smaller cylinder than any available as original equipment. 2 nuts and 30mm bolts were required to adapt.<br /><br />Good quality part.
B003SY7KHQ|5|Thank GOD for this. My light went out and we were so worried it was internal and not the light itself. Got this replacement and it was easy to install and works like a charm!
B00KS5JJ4A|5|Best wheel cleaner I've used in 50 years of car detailing.  Followed the directions and then used MF cloth to make the wheels shine on the Corvette.  Sonax has a strong odor so don't get too close.
B009AA32HE|5|Bought these to replace the OEM's on my outlander. The have performed great so far here in Houston's beat up roads. Will be buying the fronts as well when the time comes to replace them. Excellent product and good price from Amazon.
B005ILQZBO|4|The boots are somewhat comfy, but man are they stiff to walk in. They have no flex at all. When it comes to walking. I have had mine for 2 days so maybe they just need more time to break in. I think the boots shifted great on my motorcycle (2003 Honda Nighthawk), but I had to take my gear shifter off and raise it.
B00ZWRGDFM|5|Provide great soft white light and the bulbs stay very cool.
B002HEZS4A|5|easy, fast and accurate representation!  This is exactly what I wanted and it was so quick!  I recommend this plate for all Audi owners.
B001UFXS4O|5|WORKS AS POSTED
B004UM9V5Y|4|Easy to use, smells nice,taste bad,priced good, I would buy it a second time. Best price is on Amazon. Bye
B005JU5VH8|5|A little more pricey than the cheap blades I normally buy, but well worth it!! They are silent and clean like no other blade I've used. I will be replacing all the blades on all the cars with these.
B000B8N3BE|5|I purchased this for my 2000 Subaru Impreza for 2 reasons, the old locking cap had to have key in while cap was off, and to correct check engine light.<br /><br />Well, bullseye on both.<br /><br />1. This cap only needs key to be inserted and turned, then remove key from cap.  The cap will unscrew by hand. Afterwards, screw cap on until ratcheting sound is heard. Presto, it's locked on.<br /><br />2. After replacing with the 10501 cap and flashing the system, the check engine light is off.  Yipee.
B006OEWN6A|1|Never sounded clear. From day one it always had a buzzing or vibration noise. I replaced the speaker with friends other brands just to make sure it wasn't my stereo or amp. Everything sounded crystal clear and crisp with anything except Rockford Fosgate. This speaker's &#34;noise&#34; was so annoying I would just unplug it and have no base at all. Do not waste your money on this. It is so disappointing. And embarrassing when your friends are riding with you.<br />Don't pay for the Rockford name, no matter what Rockford says.
B002Z38KKM|4|Just as advertised
B005C5T5SQ|5|these look awesome on mu car they are made well and i bought the extra lexus hardware to top it off great look
B002UC4S7M|3|For the most part the glide tape works well but three of the glides tend to pop off the track unlike the original one that it replaced.
B00MYWMV7M|5|Very well made
B000CJ48YS|5|Used this as an engine oil cooler and it worked perfectly. No leaks, good mounting tabs and perfect size for what I needed.
B000TKHMWK|3|Thhe unit is simply a sealed lead acid battery, a lamp, an inverter, a simple AM/FM radio, an external plug in power source, and a control display that sort of works.   For the purpose it is intended - a low power source of 120 V AC it appears to work fine. Don't expect to carry it very far, as it is HEAVY.  My major concern is that there is no way to replace the built in battery, a sealed lead acid gel type. You have to \\"recycle\\" - read junk - the entire unit when the battery dies, as it will in approximately 2 years. This is a serioous defect in the long term.  Unless you need the immediate power availability of a battery - inverter or the \\"fumeless\\" short time operation, you would be better served to purchase a 600 watt generator and a gasoline can!
B000IYWWKO|5|Good fit, blends well with existing trim. Priced right and fast shipping from Amazon.
B00T9W255I|5|Nice product.  I added this to my WeatherTech bumper step for added visibility.
B000EDUUHQ|5|No more catching stuff when I open the medicine cabinet door ....best idea ever!!
B001FC95UI|4|Just installed the product today and used it. I have been using the 'slinky' type since owning a RV and decided to try this type. It's a much faster set up in 1/4 the time. I like the dove tail fitting channel that keeps it together when extended. The only drawback- because of the thin material it will sag. However a few blocks of wood quickly remedies this. All-in-all im satisfied. I like it much better. And the wind does NOT blow it over like the \\"slinky\\" type does. It's a keeper!
B00067BVDC|4|The bulbs arrived well packaged and delievered on time. The bulb has been performing as advertised but I have only been using them for a few weeks.
B00898LAJ0|4|Very nice mirror, easy to in stall, it does vibrate a little on my RZR 1000, I bought 2..
B009IAIX7A|5|This product is great. Many people dont realize how good it is.
B003ELVNCQ|4|This tool feels light and cheap in hand but it does what I need it to do and has worked well.  Not a bad value!
B00U2Q61P0|1|One pk generally means one pack. Meaning more then one.  I was disappointed to only see a single ballast
B000EQ7MDI|5|Pleasure to do business with, would recommend.
B001GJ3FIS|5|Works great . So purchased another . Very  satisfied .
B00396HAIC|2|doesn't fit anything after 2005 gave it to my nephew who runs a shop he was delighted because he works on older imports
B0002SREB8|5|A must have for polaris CV clamps. I saved a lot of $ doing the CV boots mymyself.all
B0041CDPQO|5|Just love it , easy to hook-up , route,and use. Color blends in and isn't noticeable in installed location. Highly recommend for that additional power hookup.
B00K75WAZ6|1|It's already broken where the chain was place to the rubber
B000NCOKZQ|5|I like the weather protection, so I can keep this on the battery and simply unplug the solar panel at night and put it away.  This is a good way to hook your charger or solar panel to the battery on your camper. I highly recommend it and would buy it again.
B000Z0HVHA|3|GOOD SOLID CABLE OUT SIDE EXTERIOR ,<br />THE NEG. AND POS. CABLES INNER ARE VERY SMALL GAUGE .<br />BEWARE .
B004VIA0LG|1|For something that is suppose to protect you it is not made well at all. Was worn twice and the zipper completely busted. does not zip up and not usable now. A waste of money!
B0036QVYPU|5|This thing does exactely what it is meant to do…clean your buffing wheel. Don't know how I got along without one for so long.
B002SQXK60|5|The kit had everything I needed to bleed the breaks. The instructions were a little weak, but I watched a Youtube video that pretty much explained everything I needed to do. The plastic storage box is a nice feature since there are a lot of small fittings for the various break types.
B00JFQLGQW|4|Handy tow rope.
B001AM8E6Y|5|perfect replacement!
B000CMJROG|3|I won't throw away the factory rugs just yet, they may need to be re-installed.  The idea is excellent to have a protective cover designed for Nissan Titan rear floor protectant, but there is no way it was designed to fit exactly in my vehicle.  The edge poses a trip hazard for passengers getting in and out of the vehicle, and it does not fit exactly as advertised.  After I take the kids to a few more baseball games and see how it holds up against them, I may change my review.
B00KGGTF9U|2|I find the name Grande Jumbo extremely misleading.  This shade was too small for my Lincoln Navigator, and it is kind of difficult to fold up.<br /><br />That said, they do seem very concerned about customer service.  I expressed my concerns, and someone explained that this is actually the smallest of their sun shades.  I ordered a larger one, and plan to return this one.  I will share my thoughts when it arrives.
B0053TUEFE|3|Not the lime green color in the description...
B006VGUF16|5|Description and picture helped with the purchase. Shipped promptly and we were able to get the 4 Wheeler fixed and back in the woods.
B002Z65Z66|5|I love the the quality of my Triple Axle covers? i wish they would make them as well in the color grey instead of just white and black.
B0093JY2B2|5|Went right in stock location no problems at a great price thanks Amazon
B000C83Y62|5|Way good
B000ARTZPO|4|How i put this to my car?
B000VKRQ8S|1|Item does not fit my car as stated on Amazon. it is cut too wide.
B005JU5TUM|2|These used to be excellent when they made them in Belgium. Now that they switched to China the quality an durability just isn't there. I used to be able to get 2 years out of a pair. Now I can't get 6 months.
B007L58MTS|4|Did the job. Would recommend.
B002IA85V6|2|I got this light because it looked good and integrated all rear lights necessary - tail, brake, license plate and both turn signals.  The turn signals would light up, but not blink. You had to do that manually. What's the point?  It is now a great looking tail and brake light, but I'm getting other turn signals.
B0085YBIXQ|5|Well made and just what was needed.  Added a full 2&#34; to the front end height and easy installation.  I did have to compress the springs a little, which I did with a couple of ratchet straps, took about an hour and a half.
B004KEJXGE|1|Was supposed to fit my water pump but wasn't even close, the big wrench was over an 1/8&#34; bigger than the nut, and the wrench without the handle was almost 1/2&#34; smaller than the bolt pattern. It would be great if this company would have bothered to list the size, would have saved me time and trouble because I wouldn't have ordered it, the write up leaves you to believe it is the only one but it isn't.
B008BRJ5FA|5|After doing some exstensive shopping and with no luck, i either could not find this item or if i did, the price was outrages. Then I went to Amazon and found it for half the price i would of paid elsewhere. From now on, I will reverse my seachers for what ever i need. Amazon will be the first place i will look for whatever i need. And by the way, when they project you're delievery date, it will arrive in half the time.Oh,  just in case you were wondering, i am not either employed nor am i being paid for this post. LOL.
B004YJTGXU|5|They are made in USA . Awesome, High quality , Heavy duty<br />My friend loves them, highly recommended to all Tacoma owner.<br />Thank for good product.
B00IMTSQES|5|I love it. Very nicely made and my bf hates it, so its perfect!! Lol
B001F2I7SE|5|This item was purchased at a great price.  It was delivered very quickly and installed very easily.  The hardest part was getting on top of my camper.
B000BO5CGW|5|This is excellent epoxy, sets up fast and hardens to a very strong bond. The tubes come sealed, so unless there is some major abuse during shipping there shouldn't be any leaks. Once it's open, you do have to be careful to put the caps on tightly, and keep the tubes in some sort of tray. Also, be sure to clean the threads after using, so as not to fowl the caps with goop. Careful use will enable you to avoid the sort of problems I see others complaining about.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Aptly described This is the one to buy, it folds up fast and fits my 2007 prius well! much better than those accordion-style shades!!!!
B00JRR7DRA|3|Fits great, works great, shape is great, but the color match was off on mine, the fin is noticeably a brighter blue, which is annoying.
B00AUFMGBG|5|Fast shipping & excellent pricing.
B004L0ABAY|4|I purchased a couple sets of these lights for a cabover camper. I am using them as outdoor camp lights. They work just fine for what I wanted but I would not buy them for a driving light. They are not as bright as I expected.
B00BITRAA0|5|Fit perfectly and after 10000 miles still working great.
B007ECFURK|5|I get lots of props off this. Lots of people take pictures of my car. Keep it up. Good job.
B00N00P0LG|3|Looks really good, got here in a timely manner, but color on one was fading and I didn't notice til I put it on the car. Looks really good from far Most people don't even notice.
B005S0K1F6|5|He was very happy about the quality and style. He loved it. He plans to use it during the summertime.
B00CIQNWGI|5|I ordered this to bring down the sound level on my 2012 CBR-250R Two Brothers Silver Series M-2 exhaust.  The sound level with standard tip on the M-2 was not unbearable, but for me this brings the sound level down to a better level for cruising.  The part was installed easily with the &#34;star tip&#34; tool supplied in the exhaust kit.  The only confusing part was the two gaskets and what to do with them.  There is a video on the Two Brothers web site, but basically you'll use the smallest gasket needed (or none) to ensure the cap seats completely and the PowerTip doesn't rattle.  I used the smallest gasket for the best fit.
B00EAOI8RY|1|Our mechanic installed this filter on our last oil change (Feb. 4, 2015). On a 30-mile trip three days later, the o-ring apparently cracked and all the oil was thrown out on the highway. It was towed to the Mercedes-Benz dealership where the estimate for repairs is in excess of $4,000!  I would not recommend this filter to anyone. When we spoke to our mechanic, he said that the first filter out of the box had a cracked o-ring which failed immediately upon installation, resulting in the loss of oil in the shop. I hate to give this filter a one-star rating.
B0002SA2DA|3|I believe this is the only top available for this vehicle, and I think Best top is taking advantage of that fact.  I replaced the factory top, which was also a Best top, and this one is much thinner, is less finished and has raw edges unlike the original.  It was easy to install.  Update March 2016 The tops sagging, the velcro doesn't stick anymore.  Please note I have never taken it off, just put it on once.  It hasn't leaked however. I got another tracker, it has the Rampage top, so there is another company that makes them.  It is half the price of this one.  Thicker material but it is undersized.  It simply won't fit on correctly, pops off on the sides.  It also leaks.    So the best top is the best of the worst, better of 2 evils.  Real expensive for what it is though.
B000F09CEA|5|The best oil your ever going to come across. If Kano can't budge it, it is not budging. I've not had anything it couldn't get through. The worst bolts will turn with a little of this on the nut. Try it before throwing your wrench at the floor.
B003K0PX86|5|Real heavy but real good!
B00A8X8NE4|1|Do not work for Chatterbox II<br />The charger cable I need has a thicker plug.
B005VVRB28|5|Had to replace a bumper on an 1987 Toyota pickup truck. This part fit well. I was glad to find it on Amazon.
B00BX5D9I6|5|These are the best hids I have purchased so far. No flicker during cold starts and excellent color.
B00RWA5W6S|4|great item.  I just to tall to use in the car.  the seat wont go back far enough to use
B0034ZP29C|4|I called the factory direct before purchasing because of a conflict as to weather this would fit my Kawasaki 360 Prarie Quad. I told them that I had a Warn winch mounting plate made for the Kawasaki model I owned. Their tech assured me that it would be a fit because the bolt pattern was the same. Guess what? I had to disconnect the supports for the top rack off io order to get it into the space where it was supposed to fit. Once I was able to get it in there I had to mark the mounting plate on where to cut it so it would fit correctly. Not an inch to spare. It did how ever fit with modifications. It is a wonderful winch with fairly easy instructions to follow and I was able to fit the selonoid right next tight to the battery under the seat. There is more wire provided than needed rather than comming up short. It took a good 7-8 hours to install and an oxy-acetelyne torch was needed to cut the mount plate. Glad I bought it because I ended up getting stuck right away and the extra long cable made it easy to find a strong source to hook up  to pull me out. I would recommend this to someone with a little knowledge of fabricating. Sturdy Product though.
B00BYFXPFM|5|Looks awesome. Showed up earlier than expected.
B001O0G400|5|The Blue Ox hitch is very easy to install!!! In my opinion its better than the B&W hitch in several ways. I know this as I have owned a B&W in the past and have had problems with it. The blue Ox is not only easy to install but it is made very well. with the Blue Ox hitch, the release for the ball is on the base of the ball. There is not going under the wheel well to pull a lever just to hope it stays in place to try and turn over the ball.
B000CAINDE|4|Bought for my brother in India.  it is light to carry in the luggage.  He has used a similar design before.
B000A0EJIO|3|This is a very good quality filter. Heavy duty.   I found out later that this type of filter requires alot of Maintenance.  If you don't maintain your filter it can damage your car.    You must clean and oil this filter.  If you don't oil you filter it can damage your car and if you oil the filter too much it can damage you car.   And they sell a special lube/oil just for this type of filter which can be very expencive.    Further more there is alot of argument online about  no  real improvment over a regular paper filter.       also I got this filter for around $10 and paid $10 for a paper filter at pepboys.
B004GCD3JS|5|Good and Easy to install
B000XQ5JSE|4|Great sockes use them every day  I really like the laser ingraved sizes on each socket<br />Speedy shipping I would recommend to profetianels and alike
B00IZ8NL0A|2|Had to return. Huge mushroom head look. Seriously like space balls and NOT a low profile at over 2 inches above brow line. My wife laughed for 15 minutes because it looked ridiculous. I would recommend a redesign to the manufacturer.
B00KTHVAL2|1|Dealership could not make the key work
B005MKQKXY|5|They are in a Toyota Tacoma, the fit is perfect. The pocket in the back is invisible, it doesn't sag.
B0017M86W4|1|Didn't read the reviews until after purchase, like others said WILL NOT FIT standard size bed. Not even close. Save your money!!
B00A4B57I0|4|Works good so far its been about 35 days .
B0026PI4A0|2|Did not fit my 2004 Jeep Liberty. I had to return it. I'm still searching for the correct tire cover.
B00MC6H0AI|5|I was just about to install lights (somehow) on the back of my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara because the factory backup lights are so weak. I decided to give these a try. Wow! Problem solved. Simply plug these in you've got great backup lights. Highly recommended. These saved me a bunch of time, money, and effort.
B0024NOA8Y|5|This headlight assembly replacement set fit perfectly on my 2002 Chevy Avalanche 1500.  The alignment holes are a little smaller than the OEM but the rods still went through with a little more push.  I went ahead and replaced the fog lights which I'll include a review on them on the product site.  I also ordered the turn signal replacement set but that order still has yet to arrive.  I also upgraded my light to the HID brand. Check out the photos...I've include a photo with both the old and new Assembly.  No tools needed and about 10 minutes to do the entire job.  TIP:  Have a rag and some Simple Green handy to take advantage of the empty space while replacing the assembly to clean the area out before putting in the new part.  I highly recommend replacing all three units on each side... 1-Turn signal, 2-Headlights and 3-Fog light assembly. Total cost for all six pieces on Amazon: $309.00.  Auto Zone listed price for the genuine replacement GM parts: over $1,000.00.  Happy Restoring!  Oh and BTW, YouTube has a great selection of &#34;how to&#34; videos to help you make the repair/replacement.  Don't waste your money on &#34;labor&#34; cost, this a definitely a &#34;Do it yourself&#34; job.  Hope this review helps.
B00DWVVB7K|5|Better gas milage by 2 mpg on the highway! Not only that but as anyone with a Honda v6 powered Vue knows performance is not lacking, however K&N states a 11.5 HP increase and I could feel it. Passing on the highway was always easy in my Vue but now it's thrilling. I'm now glad I invested the money. Engine now sounds great with a throaty grunt, accelerates quicker than ever and saves a bit of money at the pumps!
B0052XN2ZA|4|I love it, works great
B0002UEMZ2|4|I bought this to put on all my bolts on my saiga 5.45x39 project every thing holds strong.<br />I recommend this product for any one doing small projects and don't want screws coming apart.
B00H90NJ4S|5|Good product
B000FW7V50|5|This product is great !!!
B005Z3CTBA|5|I liked the fact that I could buy the fronts only, when I didn't need the backs, which had significantly less exposure to shoes and the elements.<br /><br />Just as described, and I am pleased with the product.
B00KAFFQAE|3|I too came here after seeing George Takei's post on Facebook!  Just wanted to fit in.
B00029WSX6|5|I liked the first one so much I put them in all my cars.
B000XTPO2M|5|Bought this for my sister's bicycle, which is sometimes used in a tough neighborhood. She said it would be easier to saw through the bicycle than through this lock.  I think that's an endorsement!
B007UTPUDQ|5|Its awesome and stands out above the rest.
B0012X25G6|1|I ordered 2 front shocks .  Nothing on order page indicated a left and right shock.  It only stated front shock.  When installing after breaking down struts and replacing coils the right was great.  The left was wrong.  it was a right side also.  The difference was a tab to hold the stabilizer.  the car had to be used knowing it would take several days to get another it was installed.  The company stated they would not take it back if the strut was not new in box.  Well it had to be taken out to discover it was wrong.  We didn't know until we started installing the shock and realized the tabs for the stabilizer and brake lines didn't line up.  I ended up throwing away the new wrong shock.  The company should have known two right sides were being sent.  their answer was to check part numbers on manufactures pages.
B00LZWAZFC|5|Fast shipment item was just what I was looking for mounted it to my 00 arctic cat 400 and it looks factory
B001KQD7YE|5|PERFECT FIX! works great ..
B00J0ABS5M|5|Looks great and works great.  Also ordered a hitch lock keyed alike.  Great customer service and communication.
B00CJF3N0I|5|This muffler worked pretty well but it would have been nice if it would have accepted the original Honda heat shield.  I cut the old brackets off of my original Honda muffler and welded them on so that I would have the shield.  The point where it matched up to the original pipe could have sealed better like the original design.  I had to work a bit to get it sealed.  Great performance yet a bit on the noisy side.  At one quarter the price I'm pleased with it.
B00GB5M0HO|5|I ordered these for my Suzuki Cafe bike since everyone mistakes it for a Triumph anyway, and I thought they would save the beautiful pearl paint on my tank from wear on the sides. They applied perfectly and come with a little pre-cleaner wipe to prep the area before application. They are a great addition and work so well with the paint graphic scheme that they look like a factory item. To top it off they arrived in about 3 days, much earlier than estimated, and I'm delighted with the whole process.
B00GX4Y9AY|5|Bought this and the next day to truck did not start.  Figured this was to small to start a heavy duty full size truck - it did - started instantly.  Am now putting them in all my vehicles.  Have been recommending this product.
B00N18WNV2|4|good
B009LOO1DS|5|Fast service. Great price
B00HO0ZSOW|5|I drive all day and even without the massage aspect of this product, this has helped my back very much.
B00MW8GENK|5|Great for both cars I bought 2 for
B00WL0APHK|5|These boards look great on the Toyota Tundra that we just bought.  The installation was a little confusing due to terrible instructions.  But once we figured them out, the installation went smoothly and the boards work great!
B00BXO70UU|5|fit and look great on my kia.
B0083P1N8W|1|But it never was! It has been more than a week past the last date it said it would arrive at. I waited a good month and some change for this product imagining what it would look like at work but eventually became very disappointed in my own shortcomings. Maybe its because I used a giftcard for this order and they decided Not to give me my purchased merchandise because I wasn't buying wiht my card. I am glad everyone else had a good experience with this but I however, did not have a good experience with the seller 'Car_made'<br /><br />- BT
B008QW8XSK|5|Great venting and can be seen. Exactly what I wanted.,
B000PFD3BS|5|Been using these wires for several years now on several applications. Fit and finish is great!!! Never have I ever had an issue and I have easily used 30 sets of these exact wires. Amazon is great to order from as well.
B0041K13LA|5|Works well worth the money, thanks for offering a great product.
B007H8DKOQ|1|Broken on arrival but probably would have been fine.
B004ZF31PC|3|perfect and working
B001DH8218|5|Perfect! I'll never get robbed at the car repair place.
B008O475WA|5|The filter cap came as specified without any issues.  Was a perfect fit for my Toyota and ecelled all my expectation
B000AAMY86|5|This item is invaluable and for the price is worth it.  This item is very useful and will likely save you money as you notice changes through the life your auto owning experience.  Easy to use - OR - You can make it as hard as you want.
B0002SRFQ2|3|I had to return this item because it wouldn't fit the nut for the antenna
B00I9SK56O|5|Love this stuff. I just plasti dipped my Motorcycle. Looks awesome. I did the tanks too heavy the first time and had solidified drips etc. Just tore it off the next week and did it again properly! Loving it.
B0066IUPS2|1|didnt work .. return
B000C3ZDGG|5|These are some of the best shocks I have owned, very nice ride on my old truck! I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some replacements.
B000CRI1C0|5|Awesome
B00KLFFNQK|5|I installed this on my 2003 F-150 Super Cap with a 6' Bed about 6 months ago.  The installation was very easy and I think it only took me about an hour total to install it.  I spent a little longer because I had to adjust it a couple of times to get it perfect.  Seems really durable and it is very easy to roll up and roll down and clip in.  My tailgate locks so it gives good  security since you can't unlock the cover without opening the tailgate.  I have drove through snow and heavy rain and there hasn't been a single drop of water inside.  Also I can take it completely off in a matter of minutes to get my 4-wheeler in the back of my truck with the tailgate shut.  Overall I am very pleased with it and don't see myself going back to a tool box anytime soon.
B005D1BYF6|5|It was the outline that was displayed in the online catalog.  it has a lot of detail and looks great.
B00SYSM1UM|5|Got it for my son, and it made it easier to belt his daughter in.
B00A54HCFC|5|worked great
B007JZ35JW|5|Love these gauges!!! Match all other glow shift products and matched the gauge pod in my 7.3 diesel. I did have to buy an adapter to make this fit a diesel. But worth the extra 3$. The gauges are accurate and just look great.
B000EDUTXG|5|Im so glad to ordered this because was exact as expected.
B009MAT1GI|3|It does the job of protecting your dashboard from harsh sunlight. It also fits perfectly. However, it's a hassle to have to roll and unroll it every use. I wish they made one as an accordion fold.
B000BPTVTK|5|Would not leave home without it
B00KRHOBBU|3|Yes what I wanted but too small for my car I drive a 2007 Chevy aveo and these were too small still very cute though
B000CIXOCQ|5|This is just the sound I was looking for. Mellow loud, not screaming loud. Fitment was almost perfect, price was great. Highly recommended for maybe the older generation muscle guys.
B004PC49ZQ|1|Do not buy..not bright enough..when i got them in the mail one didnt even work..crap
B00802GIW4|5|It's good
B005HMDF1M|5|excelente producto
B00I3PT5MI|5|I was so pleased to find these for my snowmobile.  I have an older snowmobile that takes these windshield straps.  I had looked in several different towns and place on the internet and was unable to find them for quite some time and then I ran across these.  I only had 2 left that had not broken so I was very greatful that I found them.  They were shipped to me very quickly and they were the same size as the ones on my windshield. The price was fair and beings I plan on keeping my sled I wanted to make sure I had some spares.<br />I am hoping to order some more thing in the future that I will be needing.  A great company.  Thank you
B00723REAC|5|This key fob is a great substitute for the OEM version.  The price was a third of what Mopar charges. One difference I have noticed is the buttons are a little more sensitive than my factory version. The casing appears the same with subtle differences. The programming was easy though it took me a couple tries to get it right. Simply stated: it works and its cheap!
B0002I9X4E|3|the wiring is weak like most outlet splitters. if it was not for that it would be perfect for the radar detector, ipod, cell phone and GPS
B008RTGO9W|5|These filters are known to be a great buy. I change the oil on bike in order to save money.
B009S31VVW|5|The piece was perfect for my 2006 ford fusion.  Went in easy with the help of YouTube.
B00NJAMTNO|4|It is so cool.
B00569N46M|5|Just as promised.
B0009H51MG|5|Good quality, it is what it says it is. Was able to install it in my car easily, but that has more to do with my car than it does the filter.
B0016IUHSU|5|Works fine. Center is painted black to help prevent rust.  Got nice, smooth stops with this rotor.<br />Made in China, though.
B000C55YMC|5|What else can I say...they're MOOG so they're awesome.  Had this installed by a mechanic because you have to drop the subframe to get at the bolts holding these on my 2003 Cavalier LS Sport.  You may be able to get to the bolts holding these in without dropping the subframe but mine were too rusted in and there isn't enough space to work with.  What else can I say...they're MOOG so they're awesome.
B007HO1BA0|4|A must have to change water pump on VW Jetta.
B00MMKIKXU|5|works great, form fitted, easy to clean, looks like carpet...but not
B000EQM7GU|1|very good thank you
B0002KKIXC|5|Takes out even the toughest carpet stains. Works great and is a life saver! A Must buy for anyone interested in protecting their carpet. We have a very light colored carpet and this has removed red wine, stubborn food spills, traffic areas, etc.  Awesome!
B005JZTNLI|4|The seat belt extenders make it much easier to buckle up in our new Chevy equinox the console makes it hard to buckle up, but with the extender the buckle is up higher and easy to connect
B000ALJ5E6|3|The color match was OK, but the paint itself is either very thin, or very old.  After shaking the bottle for a long time, I still had to apply three or four layers just to cover the primer.
B0006N5S9E|4|I used this to plug the drain on my hot tub.  It just doesn't seal tight enough by itself.  This fits fine and has a hex end so you can get a wrench on it.  But it got 4 stars instead of 5 because it did not come with a gasket.
B0031P6AIW|5|It works just fine for my camper
B001EOV3JS|5|Worked fine.
B000EEU0IO|3|Good enough to use, but barely.  But it's kind of small, doesn't attach very well (you'll need your own cables or ropes).
B000AMAE36|4|I have these on both my cars. They are extremely bright, and have a whiter light than most other headlights. The only drawback is the shorter life span of the filaments. I guess, you can't have it all! Overall, I'm very happy.
B004I8SF5M|5|Very satisfied lights came quickly looks outstanding and fits perfect and the price is affordable you can't go wrong with these guys!!!!!!!!)
B003TNGF2C|4|The bracket holes were slightly misaligned but I gently used a rubber mallet to set it. You need to trim the plastic caps to fit over the mounting brackets.
B004HOCH92|5|Exact replacement for 2010 Hyundai Tucson(known issue with faulty brake light switch).<br />Working for over 1 year now.
B00FRLNCUM|3|The seat covers are cheaply made and do not stay on the seats very well, even though I pinned everything down with the clips included. Everything else is really awesome and the lips rock!
B002FV1C18|5|Very nice, and sturdy mirror. I bought this and put it on the side of my house, I live back off the road and wanted a way to see who was coming up my driveway, or walking up on me, so I could corral the dogs. It's great !!!
B000KYYMKK|3|Key fobs worked
B003YO9Q0E|5|Fuel gauge problem on a newer dual tank Suburban? You can always just replace the sensor but at this price you can change the whole assembly and end up with a new pump, regulator, check-valve, housing, and sensor...one and done...enough said.<br />Thanks ACDelco!<br />Jeff Laney<br />International Automotive Resources LLC
B00IBOKTTO|4|looks amazing! better than the oem carpet. highly recommended!
B001P1Z7Q0|1|False Advertising.  This is NOT FIA Rated, which is why I purchased this.
B000CGK0AC|1|This item will NOT fit into 4.8 ltr chev fuel system. The O-ring is too big
B000CSW7UG|4|Perfect fit
B002EF948S|4|i like it. it was easy to put on but the only thing keeping it from 5 stars was that the letters were just a tiny bit too big. it still looks good though
B003N1VQQ0|5|Received on time and as advertised.  I had couple of china made tail lights on my boat trailer, and they soon filled with water.  I used these new ones once only and so far they are holding
B004PILLZG|5|I used dynomat on the doors but was looking for something different for the floors and for the money this stuff was hands down the best bet. Free shipping and nearly 20% less than the online autostores made this a no brainer. Very good stuff, you won't be dissapointed.
B000P67EQM|1|Filler hole will need something added to it. To much of a pain in the ass this is garbage. Practically aluminium foil its so thin. I'd never buy again
B00NTT6HF6|5|It gives my boring Keychain a cool and nice look
B006QMKXU8|5|Product was delivered on time and matched the description. The car mats are very good quality, durable rubber.
B004TGVMOY|5|Ordered this and received it within 4 days. Following the instructions received with the remote it took maybe 45 seconds to program this remote.  This was for my sons car and after the one functioning remote that he had broke I ordered this one. I'm glad that I did.  He now has a functioning remote and I did not have to go to a dealer to have it programmed.
B001EAQTRI|5|Easy install and amazing performance! Eliminated my ground loop noise completely! Quick shipping and service! Awesome product!
B00P3SLSO6|5|Just what I needed
B002JH7PEQ|5|I think this product is very convenient to use for long time travels. It can be using for recharging phones, electronic tooth brush, air bed, computer and anything.  We like it very much.
B007AUJJXM|5|They came extreamly quickly. And they stick perfectly, I have no had a problem. They also look really nice and are a perfect size for sticking anywhere.
B009DJKUKY|5|Took 15 minutes to change and my car fired right up!
B000BQYH6Q|3|It works for small cars I don't know how it would hold up against heavier vehicles like a truck
B00FDQPCR2|4|Works great!
B001VZN6ZE|5|Christmas present for my husband, loved it! Works great, really improved 2009 dodge diesal performance. Couldn't beat the price for what you get.
B007K8AA7I|5|Excellent buy...thank you
B002AMAXNA|5|Every car should have one of these tools within easy access.<br />repeat...<br />Every car should have one of these tools within easy access.
B008CE0R5E|5|Works as designed
B004IYZMUW|4|The part fits ok. It needed a couple of shims as to not cause the casing to bend or crack when mounted
B00I9ABE2Q|5|Works great!
B007AOQUGC|4|I ordered the liners for my 2010 Toyota Tundra Crew Max truck.  The liners fit perfectly into the floor space but the attachments holes need some work.  I had to take a knife and clean out the holes drilled on the front liners to the attachment screws would fit through them.  A little more attention to detail during the manufacturing process and this would have been a 5 star review.  No complaints on how they are working and the fit into the truck itself.  Exactly was I was hoping for.
B000AURP08|5|Great silencer. Fits great in my 4&#34; N1 muffler on my subie, and looks the exact same as the one in the picture. The inner diameter is about 2-2.5 inch though. My N1 alone was way loud and droned on the highway/drew a lot of attention<br />. I didn't like the tiny silencer that came with it, as it sounded fartcanish. This is about the diameter of the inside of my muffler, so its not a big cork in my exhaust like the stock one. Sounds great, well made, purchase with confidence!
B001RB0PP6|5|Go Steelers!!!<br />Love the Decal Easy application.<br />Great Cost.<br />Goes great with my black truck.<br />Nice and Clean looking Decal<br />Not Tacky
B005BFJSCA|5|The \\"check engine\\" light started coming on after fill-ups on my 2008 Porsche Cayenne.  I have about 60k miles and read that after 60k miles, the gas cap should be replaced.<br /><br />I ordered this gas cap and it is a perfect replacement for the Porsche cap.  It looks identical, even down to the fine print on the cap.<br /><br />Installation took less than 30 seconds.  I yanked the old one out and snapped the leash for this one into the car.  I then cleaned the filler area with a rag and screwed on this cap until it clicked.<br /><br />Initially this fixed my \\"check engine light\\", but not for long.  After the weather turned cold, the light came on continually.  I took it into Porsche and they replaced a leaking vacuum hose in the fuel line and I haven't had a single check engine light since.<br /><br />This is still a good gas cap that gives you an excellent seal at the fuel spigot.
B005WTPC2A|5|Outstanding blade. 9 months later and they are still working like day one - on all 3 cars! Despite being almost through a winter, they still wipe clean - cant beat a blade that lasts a year. I end up replacing the cheap ones 2-3 times a year, so end up spending the same amount of money anyway!
B005FW2JE8|3|halo's are weak! nice look but halo's are dim and one of my led bulbs went out already
B0006309XO|4|The LED isn't as brite.  Would prefer a hard wired voltage light instead.  The batteries get weak if they are left on incidently over night.  It feels good as a shifter, but you have to tighten the screw when the weather changes from hot to cold. Keep a tool in the car and you will be fine.
B000C9SR90|4|Tried to install this  myself, however the fuel lines are made of steel and were so rusty that it started a leak down the fuel line. I had to have a shop put in a brand new line starting from the tank, all the to the fuel filter. $310 later and I finally have a new filter. I bedlined the new line.
B000BYGEG4|5|Thanks
B001CEJGVC|5|First, please note the following:  The picture shown on the Amazon page is incorrect.  The shape of the filter is not rectangular as shown on the picture but is a long and narrow, but thick filter.  Also, as one reviewer said, this item CANNOT be used on your Jeep unless you have a MOPAR aftermarket housing previously installed in your car.  2010 or earlier Jeep Grand Cherokees did not have any factory installed cabin filters.<br /><br />This filter is a perfect replacement for the MOPAR brand that came with my filter housing. It works and fits exactly as the original.
B000CMIV4S|5|The kit was great eazy to put on did it in 2 hr love the air bags just ups should be able to keep the box clean that was anoying.
B00B4HVYEY|1|I filed a complaint with photos with you (Amazon) and no one responded.  The bottom sticker fell off on the first ride I made.  I never retrieved it.  Is there a better product that they have?  I still have the product minus the bottom sticker.
B00063X7KG|5|The clay kit works great!<br /><br />For the person that claimed there wasn't enough clay, you can probably clay two cars with the amount provided.  You simply have to stretch and fold it over itself until you get a clean clay surface to work with.  When you cannot stretch and fold to get a clean area, it's time to discard.<br /><br />It is certainly NOT hard work.  With copious amounts of lubrication from the included spray, the clay bar will slide relatively easily along the surface.  It is not only fast but fun also!<br /><br />Also, claying is mainly for the horizontal surfaces as they tend to collect more contaminants.
B001EOYIYA|5|There are some great videos from etrailer on how to install this lighting kit. I'm not a mechanic. But, even someone who does simple home and car repairs can install this T-Connector. I would suggest using electrical tape to secure the line from the connector to the rear left tail light. Shipping was very quick. We ordered the wrong t-connector at first and exchanged it for the correct one with no problems.
B00BY2220O|5|This little stool is great!  Nice and robust. I am 340lbs. and I can sit on this stool with no issues or worries about it collapsing.  The extra height makes it a perfect &#34;pack away&#34; stool for events where lugging larger stuff around can be a pain.  Great price too!
B002N3TSUK|5|great
B000W0KTKY|1|Works at first, jams up after awhile and won't release. Left me stranded. Thought it was a good deal, but when I got stuck and couldn't move my bike I would have been happy paying triple for a lock that works. I was tempted by the price and bought this lock, but when your stranded somewhere you can't put a price on being able to get this lock off- a locksmith can though $$$. Do yourself a favor and buy a better one.
B001C6Q7RQ|5|Wow, same quality as OEM but a fraction of the cost. Really a no brainer, if you need this, but it here.
B006UUQ2YM|2|I bought a few Decals for my gaming PC, and this was the only one I had trouble applying. It has wrinkles and the thinner parts keep peeling away. Sure it was cheap, but I guess you get what you pay for.
B001G7L7U8|5|I needed this part for my car because the original on it was warped and killing belts horridly. After going to the dealership and finding I'd have to pay over $100 for this part I frantically searched the net for a better price. I found that here. This part was shipped and came sooner than promised, for that I am grateful! I needed help jacking up my car, so the s/o did that, but I put the part on with ease! I have a 2003 Nissan Maxima GXE and this is the right part for it! No more messed up belts since I installed this part! THANK YOU!!!
B0051PJWQW|4|This stuff really works.
B003XNCG1C|4|KIND OF GETS IN THE WAY OF KEYS
B008J5H6I2|5|I recently replaced the outdoor condensor unit at my home with a Trane unit.  I have two condensors, one for upstairs and the other for downstairs.  The new unit was considerably louder than my old unit.  I spoke with the installer who told me that's just the way the Trane units are now.  It was so loud, my neighbor complained about the noise.<br /><br />I researched solutions on the internet and I thought I would have nothing to lose by trying one of the Brinmar Sound Blankets.  It was easy to install and really solved my problem.  Now the loudest operational noise is from the fan, which is unavoidable.  I am a believer.  This blanket really did the job for me.  I would estimate it dropped the noise by 80%.  If you have a noise problem, give this item a try.
B00BGPTWAC|3|A little hard to install correctly but look amazing and defintley anti theft
B000EDUUJO|1|Much smaller then I expected. It holds maybe 6 bags for me and repeatedly keeps popping off of the back panel that holds the actual bag holder part on. I wish this was about 3x as large!
B0002NIJVC|4|Good product
B000N5II6U|5|I installed this system on my 94 Civic Del Sol Si to replace a failing custom exhaust based on the stock system that was in the car.<br /><br />It is a little bit louder than stock but is much quieter than any other aftermarket system I have seen. At idle and low rpm it has a bit of a rumble. At higher RPM and normal loads it is quiet enough to be almost inaudible from inside the car. It does not have any drone on the highway.<br /><br />The system comes in two pieces, similar to the picture on this page but with the exit on the passengers side like the stock system. The flange used to connect the two sections is not the same size nor in the same position as the stock exhaust. It is also not a flexible joint but two flat faces bolted together with a gasket in between.<br /><br />It comes with the two gaskets you will need, along with the two bolts and three nuts you will need. It does not come with the rubber hangers. If your hangers are failing or old I recommend going to honda and getting new ones. The hangers are not all the same length, so make sure you get the right ones.<br /><br />The system comes with a warning that a bit of white smoke is expected as the packing material in the muffler cooks for the first couple times. This turned out to be a bit of an understatement. My first 20+ minute drive on the highway with the muffler caused it to release a considerable cloud of white smoke as soon as I exited the highway. That was the only time it produced any smoke and hasn't done so since.
B004BTMAVI|5|Installed this part on a 2001 Impala with a 3.8L engine.  The install took approximately 15 minutes.  This module cleared up the bad ignition issue and the rough running engine.  It has been working flawlessly for two weeks.<br /><br />I would buy this again.
B00PVCXOSM|4|It was easy to installe
B0024NWWJS|5|i had bought these headlight replacements for my mothers saturn vue, it took maybe 20-30 minutes, easy to install(may have taken me longer than a mechanic, being the fist time ive replaced any headlight). FAST SHIPPING, extremely well packaged/protected. thank you AutoLights&Bulbs  I CAN SEEEEE errrrp my MOM CAN SEEEEEE :D have a amazing day
B00CUKXODI|5|Very nice. They link together side by side.
B0016WIWXI|5|Easy to install, just follow the directions.  Nothing more than removing the tailgate cover, pop out the handle cover, insert the pop&lock, and reassemble.  Works great as well.
B00363D9Y2|5|Great little auto emblem, looks just like picture and very easy to stick onto bumper.  The black really stands out against my white car.
B002X6VXL4|1|Air compressor doesn't work! A wanted to inflate a pool for my son and didn't work... I tried to return it and i couldn't!! I've been buyin from Amazon for a couple years and this is the first time i post a negative rating....  Disapointted!!!
B0012ETJ1O|5|Got these for my wife and replaced both headlights when one burnt out. Wife loves them, brighter than her stock headlights, easier to see in general, would order these again in a second.
B001UFXTG6|5|Wow, well this kit & product did install perfectly and do the job, just as I expected.<br /><br />It took a little figuring to see which kit my truck - 1997 Dodge Ram 4x4 Diesel needed, but the Hellwig website model chart showed the # 61902 kit, with the Silent Feature to be the one.<br /><br />I think they make a couple variations of this kit, depending if you have a Ford, Chevy or Dodge.<br /><br />This kit is helpful for those trucks like mine, that are the 'heavy 3/4 ton' ie the 2500 models, that were made without factory 'camper overload springs'.<br /><br />If you start carrying heavy loads in your bed, or most challenging of all, a top heavy cab-over, slide in Truck Camper (like our Lance Squire 5000 model - a fully self contained 10' camper - 2' hangs over bed in back, 17' from tip to tail), you'll need some extra support to hold the extreme amount of weight you're adding to the rear axle in the bed.<br /><br />So, we added this 2 long leaf helper spring kit - it has all the hardware to install it, and installation wasn't difficult at all.<br /><br />The effect of this kit was to raise the ride height by 3\\" - it no longer sags badly, in fact it now allows the truck to ride perfectly level.  This makes it feel better & safer going down the road, plus it's now totally level when camping - a nice feeling !<br /><br />We also added the 'other' common rear suspension item...the Hellwig Rear Sway bar, at almost the same time.  Both are needed if your truck doesn't have them, when carrying heavy bed loads, especially a truck camper.<br /><br />For those doing a TC, it might help to add that we have all 4 Rancho RS9000 Adjustable shocks, and the upgraded 19.5 medium duty 'Rickson' tire & wheel package - in our opinion a must if you're a SRW - single rear wheel - truck, not a dually.<br /><br />So, there's a lot to do if hauling a heavy truck camper, and Hellwig has a great product here.  For those just hauling modest loads or pulling a Travel Trailer or 5th wheel, this Hellwig Load Pro 2500 will be all you need, and then some.<br /><br />It bears mentioning that you can adjust the tightness of the outer u-bolts so that the spring is barely or not making contact with the spring ends when truck bed it unloaded - thus meaning you won't notice any difference when running empty - the Spring won't 'go to work' until a load is added and then it will 'Spring' (punny) into action !<br /><br />Wish I could add a picture to the review - maybe later I'll do a video review showing the truck & camper combo.....safe travels & God bless all,<br /><br />David in E Texas
B001TE0IMG|5|good
B00Q754Y86|5|Delighted with this tire cover for our new Jeep Wrangler.<br /><br />The cover itself is made out of structurally strong, plastic covered fabric sewn with marine grade thread and appears to be very durable. This will allow the cover to repel our notorious Seattle rain as well as deal the hot summer sun ;)<br /><br />Because it was made to fit our Jeep's specific tire size, it fits like a glove and looks great :)
B002OPUPMW|5|Love how this these are.  Excellent grips at a reasonable price.
B002M5M1QW|5|Nice fit and finish. No problems! When you get these mark them left and right because they are almost identical!
B0026MCTL8|1|Bought one at a local auto store and it leaked on the tubing/bracket, not on the connection side.  I returned it and bought on Amazon, connects in minutes, tried it and leaked in exactly the same spot.  There is a quality problem with this product.  I spent too much time on this already ......
B00EARCXXG|5|Excellent tool
B000CO9YOW|1|The jack would not hold its height when jacking up my car.  It will come down slowly even if I tighten it.  Also, the handle is so hard to use, when I try to lower the car, its either can't turn or turn it too fast and drop my car.
B000TYOFEO|5|I got the switch right on time and it only took a few seconds to install. Once again Amazon has pleased me! I recommend this for anyone with the same model vehilce that it can go into.
B009KSUF62|4|This is more than a good amount of paint. Thebrush supplied was usable. This is a better deal than many sellers. The paint is thick and true to color
B00HXCHY2U|5|Perfect fit for a 2011 harley streetglide for the rear speaker channel to work
B00OY6VNGQ|5|[[VIDEOID:50cd091ba57d147c6766abe2843c6754]]This is an absolutely stunning piece that is beautiful. The butterfly is nice and vibrant in color and made for a great gift for my daughter who loves it. I love the clip on feature which makes it attachable to bags, backpacks and even my purse. It is a nice collectible charm that is stylish yet simple. I highly recommend this product! We just bought another item.
B0009A2NYM|1|Don't throw away your money.  Feel like I got ripped off.  Barely got warm, not enough to do anything, and stopped working within a month.  JUNK!!
B0033XYBC4|5|I was struggling to get my u joints out until I got this tool I've used it several times since very easy to use even with out an impact wrench
B0080MXQFQ|5|If you have the 98 with the 5 star hubcaps do not get these. I accidentally did. But they are really nice and so I gave them 5 stars because it wasn't their fault I bought the wrong product. I wish they made them for the 98 but everyone only want to sell the entire center hub which is pretty expensive for 4.
B001O13BLO|5|I read all the other review and it Seemed like 99% of all people were Very Pleased with the Product and the time it came. I just want to say: I ordered this part on Christmas Day! and I got it Literally 2 days later, the fastest Delivery I've had since shopping here on Amazon and I've been shopping on Amazon for Years!!<br />Install was VERY Easy, popped off the old metal bracket off old lift. And I literally installed the New Trunk Liftgate air pumps while I was on the Phone with a friend, LOL and Soo true people said this part works VERY Good the Trunk now practically Fly's open!  I LOVE it , because before that hatchback has fallen on my head and that SUCKED!  I was always afraid of getting whacked again, My dad made a gadget with part of a golf stick to keep it open which worked for awhile.  But this part is Much better, couldn't Be Happier, I will def. purchase this again IF I need to.<br />Last thing I Never have to worry about getting whacked in the head anymore! praise the Lord!
B004ZF43Y0|5|So far everything is working fine
B005XRQQEY|4|No water leaks or fogging in the lens. Leds are nice but wish they were brighter. Less bright because of the black housing, silver reflects more light output. No issue with fit and took 15 minutes to swap old out for these.
B00IT5HT4S|5|Fits my chopper perfectly
B004EDFF90|3|Seat covers material was not what I expected.
B00S4PTEXC|5|I adjusted the Carb. On my Chainsaw with it,  It worked.  What more is there to say?
B0068FXI8C|5|My '07 Dyna Superglide TC96 was running a bit hot when I put in a performance Cam, whic then caused the aluminum heads to expand & create lots of noise in the valve train (between rockers and pushrods.<br />I changed from straight 60wt fossil oil (which was used unsuccessfully to quiet the clicking), back to 20w50 full synthetic, and added the Jagg Oil Cooler.<br />Before the cooler, the engine oil in the resevoire would reach 248 to 252.<br />Since I put in the cooler, the oil has not gone past 212 F.<br />This significantly reduced noise & engine runs much better and stronger!<br />I recommend this for anyone who does a cam upgrade on a 96&#34; or larger twin-cam.
B004JL7N2E|5|I bought a used dolly and bought these straps.  Then I sold the trailer and made a profit of about $250.  Nice straps!
B00AQ4VNWO|5|I was a lot easier ordering this item on line with free shipping than it would have been for me to drive to the dealer and buy them. Not to mention no tax
B00375JBL4|5|Cyber Clean recommended so I decided to try it. Really does a good job.
B00876Z40U|5|Beautiful thread work, color, and size. Looks great of my leather vest.
B0002MBC3K|5|Looks awesome + Easy to clean + You won't run into anyone else who has them = Buy immediately<br /><br />Do the math.
B00NPM37U0|3|I truly want and Android system in my vehicle, and I have been tolerating this unit for almost 4 weeks now.  I think it is great, but there is one big problem holding me back.  The radio goes out after 10 minutes of use.  All other components work and work well.  The AM/FM tuner does not. Like clockwork, the radio works in the morning for 10 minutes and then suddenly there is no volume, just dead silence.  The GPS works well, the DVD player works well, any cameras I attach work well, but the darn radio does not.  It is bizarre.  After driving for 5 minutes I can change the radio stations and the radio shows that I have changed the stations, but the sound coming from the speaker has not changed.  Then the sound goes out completely.  It is very frustrating and time for me to return it.
B00027GUMI|5|This item was exactly as described by the seller and delivered promptly.  I am very satisfied.<br />Perfect fit and high quality kit.  I have used several of these for both my 1986 35 hp Mercury<br />and 1987 50 hp Mercury outboard.  Both have identical bottom ends.
B000C7XNFA|5|Correct fitment,excellent price
B00857CM8S|5|This sticker isn't really as big as it appears in the picture however it still looks pretty cool. It's a great sticker and a good Christmas present for the Sasquatch enthusiast in your life, like my brother :)
B00HQKD8II|3|Velcro attaches to clothing, have to keep adjusting the Velcro.
B000IYDEOC|5|Just installed these yesterday and was impressed. Needed two different sizes for my vehicle. After spending much time I realized that the stock wiper on the passenger side could use an inch more then came stock with the car. The wiper blade  now rests slight above the bottom edge of the windshield and does not come close to the other wiper. Incase you were wondering the a and b designation on the package does mean something (22a or 22b). The b designation indicates that the   wipers are a little more flexible and designed for windshields that are more curved. Those Germans think of everything.  Anyways it took less then 30 seconds a piece to install. There is not a lot of waste in hardware and they simple click in and work. Love the plastic boot around the connection point. Not that there is much wind noise from the old stock designs we are used to but you can see that wind with this design will just roll over the top. Very pleased. Will replace them when they start to streak or pool water but looking forward to great performance in downpours and other visibility hindering conditions that mother nature chooses to offer.

B000BZEIVQ|5|Excellent.
B000CPI5Z0|5|I've tried many products over the years (Techron, BG44K, Lucas, 3M, etc.) but I've never had a product provide such an immediate and noticeable difference. As an initial cleaning, I put half a bottle in the tanks of both our vehicles. I've hardly driven one vehicle since adding this product, so I can't yet provide much feedback with regard to that vehicle. However, I took a two-hour interstate drive today with the other vehicle and noticed a 1.5 MPG higher reading than I had previously seen on the vehicle's trip computer. As the trip was on the highway, it was almost completely steady state driving, so I can't really offer much impression as to any performance impact. Both my vehicles are meticulously maintained, but have high-mileage.  I'm not sure if a newer vehicle would see as much gain.
B00KL2N15I|5|Bought as a gift for my Sister.  She loved it as much as she loves her Dog.
B00F8M5H1W|5|works great
B001I1GFRC|5|works well
B00AUFMGBG|5|Very nice and easy to install.
B003X5C5Y8|4|The make was good. Fit around my big head was great. It's a little short. My others I have I can tuck in my shirt top. But other than that it looks good.
B000CQOIVO|5|I put this on a Jayco 1207 tent trailer.  I use it in conjunction with the main jack.  Installation was fairly simple, I did have to find and use smaller bolts as the ones this comes with are too big for our frame, but once that was done this does support the weight of the trailer and helps us moving it manually.
B001DBVPY0|5|Really easy to install with a much better price then their competitors. Keep in mind that each of the individual pieces are available through your local auto parts store as a special order item.<br /><br />I'm very satisfied
B0014FGVVW|4|This tool will save you a lot of money and headache if used correctly. Follow the instructions and it works as advertised.
B0046YMYCS|5|Super bright! I mounted this to the license plate frame on my motorcycle and it looks and performs great. Very bright lights will increase your rear visibility, especially at night!
B000C9ORAS|5|less than 1/2 the price of the dealer.  lol what a joke.  WOrk just fine so far
B000FW2NEY|5|Totally love this...fits my 2011 Nissan Quest 15&#34; steering wheel perfectly.  Very cushiony and comfortable while driving.  I agree it was a bit tough getting it on, but not so hard that I had to have my husband do it.  For the price, you can't beat the value.
B00JH6LO58|5|in the package not incluyerton me harness relay and capacitors
B00IGDWYVG|1|Terrible experience with this product. Have a Chevy 1500 LS 4x4 & has completely screwed up my front suspension, ride quality & control arms. Looking into buying & replacing this 'poor mans' lift kit with a real lift kit to help in future cost/ replacement parts needed to correct this product.
B005A8MNFC|2|Not strong enough grip to keep drinking cup upright.
B000C57ZPQ|5|These are easy to install Great product with perfect fit.  Ford F-150 1997
B00MGHVRVG|5|Works really well as an additive to a water cooler system for a 50W CO2 laser cutter.
B004CZ24VW|5|Very satisfied!!! Only complaint is that it didn't sit flush where my gas pedal is. I have a 2012 528i
B00HPL6XK8|1|This is NOT a Handstands Sticky Pad Roadster. This knock off is has no stick to it whatsoever. I would not recommend purchasing this.
B006TYTFSE|5|Heavy duty metal frame and fastners. Adds that extra little touch with the Dodge in silver and the red War Paint hash marks.
B00EEGDMRO|1|These did not fit on my 2002 expedition and I had to pay to have it fixed. Very annoying and frustrating
B000E7VFE4|1|I spent a good deal of time installing these locks, following the instructions to the letter, aligning them properly, etc.  After being installed for 2 months and less than 300 miles, the catch rounded off and started allowing the hood to pop up.  I don't drive my Jeep often, but I certainly don't want the hood to fly up at 65 miles an hour on the Houston Highways.  Junk, Junk, Junk.  Run away.
B0031HEIDY|5|You light up my Life... Working well enough to get me home.
B006OQ35GU|4|1
B000BQSIWK|5|This is very light weight and does the job. I also love the storage area for the cords, although it is a little bit of effort putting them away. I've had no trouble at all charging various batteries of different sizes. I really like the voltage readout and percent of charge on a battery.
B000SESVS6|5|Very nice item. Helps me show my pride for my son and the Army. Easy to install. Will order from seller again.  Thanks.
B0035J83D4|5|I purchased the American Thunder for my 2009 Dodge Charger RT yesterday. The stock exhaust made my Hemi engine sound like two hamsters rolling around in a cage. For the people worried about the Drone... Yes it's pretty annoying especially between 70-80 MPH and/or at 2200 RPMs. Everything else in between is sweet bliss.<br /><br />Let me get something straight, you own a bad ass american muscle car (If it's an RT). If you don't want it to sound mean and turn heads, sell it. What's the point then? The American Thunder gives an amazing throaty sound especially at idle. When you punch the gas, you feel like a rocket ship is taking off. It's a controlled noise that really keeps a low tone.<br /><br />Install took about an hour and was around $140.<br /><br />Every time I auto start the engine and hear a monster waking up ready to cruise the streets, I get an evil smirk on my face. The investment is well worth it. If you are worried about the drone go wit the Force II by flow master. BUT-You wont get as deep and aggressive tone.<br /><br />Side note-Wait about 50 miles before getting on the gas to allow the computer to adjust to the new air flow.<br /><br />I called flowmaster and they said you will see an increase of 15 HP and a little bit of torque. I am not sure if I notice that but oh well.
B0074EN7AU|1|Lasted exactly 1 year...  Broke again.  DO NOT BUY FROM BIGFLYSPORTS!  They will not honor the 5 year warranty.
B000E28EOS|5|Nice rack! Very well built, just what we were looking for. Plenty of tie down points too!
B00KGGTF9U|5|Good!
B005GY8AVQ|4|This was very easy to install and works great.  The quality is very good.
B002E80U2Y|4|This couple key chain is very cute; however, I'm rating it 4 stars because the only issue I had was that there was a piece of magnet sticking out of the boy's mouth (as mentioned in one of the previous reviews). Once you put the two together, you can't tell that there's a piece of metal sticking out of his mouth. You could view it as his tongue sticking out to kiss her cheeks =). Other than that, this couple key chain is cute and for the price, it's ok to buy. Plus took only 2 days to receive this item.
B00FJW4F6E|3|It is clearly written in the notes section of this item (as of 4/28/14) that this is a \\"Problem Solver\\" product, however this \\"Problem Solver\\" control arm DID NOT come with the \\"Problem Solver\\" rear bushing!  It came with a factory-style rear bushing that is known to have durability problems, hence the release of Moog \\"Problem Solver\\" control arm bushing K200797.<br /><br />I had to purchase a Problem Solver bushing separately (for nearly the entire cost of this control arm assembly), bring it to a machine shop and have them press out the poorly designed factory-style bushing that came in it, and have them press in the Problem Solver bushing (also at an additional cost, of course).  All this more than doubled the initial cost of this \\"Problem Solver\\" arm.<br /><br />Aside from this, everything else about the arm was fine.  The ball joint had a greasable fitting and a rubber boot.  I don't know if Moog makes new control arms or remanufactures used control arms, but it appears to look identical to a factory Chrysler (Dodge) control arm.
B00CODD72Y|4|Jacket is great quality, in addition, it has two pockets on either side down near the bottom of the front.<br /><br />However, the picture makes it look longer than it actually is. The jacket is a normal length.
B000CCFGMS|4|Ordered for a 2006 GMC Sierra 1500 4X4. I made the mistake of not measuring the clearance of the passenger side exhaust pipe crossover and had to cut roughly a foot of pipe to allow me to install it (my manifold flange bolts are rusted so I couldn't just drop it). I was planning to get my exhaust redone but now I'm doing it sooner then I planned. Just make sure you have the clearance before you purchase as it can add some pain to the job.
B00KGFR1CY|4|This was an exact replacement for the old one so I knew it would work.  After having replaced it, however, I realized there was really nothing unique about it, and it could have been replaced with a cheaper alternative.
B006GRJ06G|5|I had been looking all over for this type of seat cushion.  Exactly what I wanted to replace a previous product.
B0046BJVDQ|1|Only came with the wheel cover.
B00CA97J3U|5|Works great
B000F5HUTE|5|Worked good after I figured out I was doing it wrong. Slide this tool over your heater core pipe, close it and slide it into the back of the fitting. Slowly twist and pull on the fitting and it will come off pretty easy. I was trying to pull the tool and fitting off together which will not work as the tool will hit on the lip of the pipe. Coat the rubber \\"O\\" ring of the new fitting with antifreeze before installing. Hint, if you have a 7/8\\" fuel line disconnect, the plastic kind that will slip around the pipe, it will work too, just pull on the fitting itself when removing. Wish I would have figured this out before ordering.<br /><br />Thanks
B003A8D6YG|4|This has worked really well at keeping my iphone from sliding around.  Over time it starts to get dirty and not work quite as well.  I need to try cleaning it.
B003G0KCCM|2|I read all the reviews and figured this purchase is a \\"no brainer\\" - well, I was the exception to the rule, I guess. To be fair - I own a Ford Flex and was sent mats for a Ford F-150. The mats seem like a nicely made product, but not for my vehicle. Didn't fit at all. Sent em back and paid half the price for mats that were specifically made for the vehicle.
B0002JMV06|5|as described great product
B000CMHTUU|4|Bought this for my husband, looks great compared to tan carpet mats. Only drawback is that u have to cut the excess off yourself. We were confused at first, thought I ordered wrong size but quickly figured it out.
B000RFUF12|4|Works very will to maintain my Golf Cart Batteries.
B0038ZVAQ2|4|This is of good quality, but there are much better fans out there.  I gave it four out of five stars based on the price to performance ratio.  Just make sure you have this wired right into the relay or it will run extremely slow.
B0033WDFEK|5|very heavy duty, fit great in my 2012 F250 in my B&W goosneck
B004DRXSPA|5|I had cloudy lenses on my 16 year old car.  I tried polishing the lenses with very little improvement.  These are a very reasonably priced option that are an easy install for a person with average mechanical skills.  100% improvement over the old lights.
B00IVV2LBG|3|Decent but cheap
B005EJGSQ2|3|good for 1 winter and buy another one
B00E1SNXJC|5|Great value and easy to install.  Everything needed was included.  Surprisingly look like new even after driving in this terrible winter weather.
B008GOVR5O|5|right part at a great price!! I had looked everywhere for this part and They wanted triple the price so glad I found it with yall!
B00DLMQHX8|4|bought this product for my 2016 CX-5 touring. Although amazon is adamant that this product does not fit the 2016 model...it does! and perfectly at that. I have bought weather tech before, but saw this product was cheaper with good reviews, so I thought I would give it a try. I like it, but I will say that I think the weathertech is more of a heavy-duty product than this. On my old car, I would remove my weathertech floor mats and use the power washer at the car wash to clean them without any problems......I wouldn't dare do that with these though as they are not 100% rubber like the weathertech version.
B000TYSBHQ|1|right part#, but wrong part. the picture is even wrong. i ordered driver and passenger side and knew the picture was different. just thought parts looked different. took to chevy dealership to have installed and passenger part was completely wrong. has to go thru hassle of mailing back. so be careful!!
B00BHNFAMC|4|I recently purchased and used this product for a gash on my bumper that was deep to the plastic surface. The product is pretty simple to use and does work pretty well. Due to the severity of the scratch on my bumper I didn't expect it to be fixed and as it was on the bottom half of the bumper so I was just hoping to camouflage the damage. The product did just that. From a distance of a couple of feet away you can't see the damaged anymore, but if you know where to look and get within a foot of the scratch it can be spotted as the paint does not match 100%. If you have a small chip or scratch or its in a less visible spot this product will work great.
B0073G2N40|5|These were easy to install and work great. They project the same distance as the Silverstar Ultra's that they are replacing, but much whiter. I got the 5000k kit which are perfect. There was a minor issue with the first set which was corrected immediately by the excellent customer service department. I have tried a number of bulbs in my Lexus CT200H. Silverstar Ultras were great but had to be replaced every 3 months. I have also tried a high end LED bulb which did not illuminate properly in the Lexus projection housing. The Kensun's work as advertised. I will post updates assuming they last more than 3 months.  We are now at almost a year. These guys are still going strong. No failures or Dimming.
B000C7YD18|5|Fit my car. Has a little note in the box saying. &#34;The original design of this relay had 8 pins.  The design was changed by the OE Manurgacture to have only 7 pins. This relay will operate exactly the same as the original design and it is full interchangeable.&#34; My car still doesn't start and I have since replaced the fuel filter with no luck. Now I'm thinking about changing the fuel pump.
B00030LM54|5|works great
B001O215CK|5|I've been using this for about a month now.  I really liked the stock feel of my steering wheel, but this just looks and feels so much better.
B000KGDYDE|5|I saw this on a car driving down the road and decided I MUST have one. My car doesn't have an antenna, but what a great gift to have on hand for someone who does an antenna! (I knew before I bought this my car didn't have one...but I couldn't help myself.) He is a cross between adorable and hysterical - and is sure to get you noticed on the road! I suppose it would also help you locate your ride in a parking lot (how many people have these??) - but it's while driving that he really stands out. As your car goes down the road, he shakes and shimmies on your antenna like he's going down a fire pole...and who doesn't need THAT on a daily basis?<br /><br />Bottom Line: Not a necessity for life...but who doesn't need a little humor in their day? You can boost your own spirits - and those of countless motorists on a daily basis!
B000701HF0|5|Fit perfectly in our Eclipse toy hauler.
B007HG7Y7M|5|Great price.  works great
B000I2SWXC|4|It is a sturdy bar that stays in place. I haven't had any issue with it sliding or coming loose. I use it every day to keep boxes in place for my work.
B0009IQZFM|4|Better then the supreme shine. But could be better. Buy the Waffle-weave Design from integral innovation thats a 5 stars
B005ESU8CI|5|Some idiot walking his dog at night threw a rock at my truck as I passed and took out the headlight. This one fits like the original one. Very pleased with product and the price.
B0077AYEF8|5|Arrived very fast and was exactly as stated, even came with directions as to how you apply. Very easy...
B00DMS6INK|5|Thank you is very fast
B006W9R73Q|5|Does what it's supposed to do, looks like it'll last.
B00EZNF6SY|2|This thing is HUGE. It's more like a pillow than a seat belt cover. We are going to have to modify it by removing the stuffing, or at least most of it... after that, it'll probably do the trick.
B004ZF39T0|5|perfect!
B00TNTQKM6|5|Very good purchase-we are using it on our boat
B00K6AQWBK|5|worked great
B0073J97N2|5|My '95 Goldwing would not start. First I changed the battery $55. Still would not start. Then I removed the starter and replaced the brushes and greased the bearing. Bench check, the starter worked great, $40. Put the starter, the starter would not go only a click. Took a battery cable and jumped from the battery to starter the starter would crank. That just leaves the starter solenoid. Looked online for a new solenoid they wanted $79. Punched the part number into Amazon and this solenoid listed for $8. Got the solenoid the other day and the starter cranks over great. Could have fixed my problem for $8.<br />One thing is that the wire connector did not go on all the way like the original. However for $8 I am fine with this.
B003HWQY08|5|Have had this product for over two years and its held up just fine. No frazzled pieces coming off that I have to cut. It's a little darker now because I haven't washed it, but it's very soft.
B001EG4QJA|5|another great money saving replacement
B0081KM6Q2|5|great deal. i would recomend
B00EKTIQ8U|5|Great replacement for my old ugly, beat up ones.  Easy to install, still looks good after i got them 5 months ago.  I wish they were made out of metal instead of plastic, but they still make my pickup shine.
B005UZMP3A|5|This is an excellent Gasket-maker / Sealant that is easy to apply and seals all types of gear oils, but is especially good for use with gear oils that have the friction modifiers included in the formula -- as well as gear oils that require customer-added friction modifiers, such as those for Limited-Slip  applications.<br /> Can be easily applied by inserting cartridge into a standard (manual) caulking gun. Screw-on tip is a nice feature that allows full control of the bead as it is applied.
B00159Q0IG|5|I love it so much! I wanted the aggressive feel of the guard and I tested out the guard and it was study as it can be !
B000V4YJ3Y|4|Perfect fit to my 89' Accord LX 4L. It is made in China. The quality seems just as good as U.S. made part. (You can't find any U.S. made brake parts any more.) Worked great for three months so far without any issue.
B000C44C0S|5|Ride, road noise, handling and response are all improved when you upgrade to these amazing suspension products. I am very pleased with my upgrade on a worn out 98 mazda protege dx. It's like driving a new and nimble sportscar. YeeeaaaaaYYYY! Look around and you can find really good deals here online and the shipping is always fast and accurate. On a recent trip down US 1 to Key West my wife and I were very impressed with strut upgrade. Have fun...go for a drive.
B009DJRG7O|5|Looks great
B005XEFADU|5|Works very well. But of course I haven't used any others. The folks on my Yahoo group all swear by it. It is a bit pricey, but once you smell the alternative it's worth it..!
B000VJR0NU|5|Great filter!
B00076QA4C|5|Just put our groceries in this yesterday and wow what a great place to keep them all in place on a driveway that has a slight incline!!
B00CHI8ACI|5|My key is looking new!! Took the new one with the old one to a locksmith and got it cut. Then switched the transponder chip. Works great.
B000C2CCJI|5|Perfect Fit... !!! What can I say. When you got it, you GOT IT...
B0002SR2RY|4|Did the trick. Had to file down some sharp edges around the opening of the socket to be able to get the pressure switch in and out easily.
B000B6NQHW|5|Great product! Just installed today.
B00063WRH0|4|So far so good for holding seams leak free.  Dont know how well it is for structure stability just yet.
B005C5SLSQ|5|Bling bling. I can definitely say it is of good quality and was an excellent price. Love it. Looka great on my black Mustang!
B007PX68Q0|5|I mean it's a sticker, It's good.
B000XTPO2M|5|Perfect item
B001PNIJM2|5|It  did what it is suppose to do
B001FAIAA6|5|The Jeep I bought came with very cheap seat covers and I was nervous buying new ones since I wanted quality yet have never bought covers before. I'm glad I picked these.<br /><br />The material is definitely wet suit material (and very thick).  It grips skin and clothes a bit much and can make a rubbing sound when shifting in your seat, but these complaints are very minor.  My seats look brand new and in turn my Jeep looks much newer.  The seats fit very well.  The groves and stitching seems to match the exacts grooves and stitching of the original seats which makes them form fit the actual seats.  The only part not form fitting being near the top (it looks as if there is an air pocket), but they still look fantastic.<br /><br />Apparently, this material fades, so they recommend UV spray treatment to help it hold it's color.<br /><br />Also, the picture on Amazon is incorrect.  The tan inner stripe goes all the way to the top of the seat.<br /><br />This product beat my expectations.
B00INZ65B2|5|Great service, easy install
B004GCNJ1U|4|So installed the passenger mirror and it went in, but the insulation was a bit thicker so i had to firmly press it in while screwing in the bolts. and there is a slight gap between the top of the mirror and panel. Passenger side picture shows the gap, and the drivers side shows a much tighter fit.
B002I9VYF6|4|Little bit bigger than I wanted... Good product
B000CMHVA8|4|I added this liner to my 9-7X.  It covers quite a bit more area than the stock ones, though it doesn't seem to be as high quality.  I'm going to leave it anyway due to the superior protection/coverage.
B00QVP9VDA|3|The size of the cover is perfect for my vechile, however the magnets are not strong enough to hold during windy times. I had to buy and attached small magnet buttons as reinforcement.<br />I still love the cover because it works for my small frost days.
B0006H8BEY|5|Great price and Amazon does it fit your car features a nice I had ordered the other side once before so this will be my second one ordered
B000FOJSHW|5|It shines
B0019I9SV4|5|Seal worked and fit as it should
B0040IZXFK|5|Luv it!!!
B0000AY4MK|5|This item was received on time and packaged very well. Works great, is easy to step up on and with rounded ends is not a hazard to bump your knees on.
B0057OC9B2|2|I'm not really impressed with the product. It doesn't clean as easily and well as advertised. The shine doesn't stay, I'd say a month at the most and only sometimes. i won't be buying it again.
B000BQSIWK|5|Works as intended.
B002GO93I8|5|made in the USA, and that counts. quality at the top.
B00E1ETJNU|5|Great fit and quality!
B005BNZ6WI|3|This grease container fits nicely under the sink, but is fairly small (about 9 inches high)  The bags that go inside have leaked before, which just makes the mess we all are trying to avoid.  If the bag holds, it works well, but the top is not secured, it just lays on top so be careful when taking it out.
B000C2QQUO|5|This part worked first time with no surprises or leaks because all gaskets and o rings came with it.Installation went very well,I had to remove the grille to get to a fitting,but no problems.Many Thanks
B00DSSNPSU|3|The mats for the front driver side and passenger side is great, but the mat for the back had to be cut to fit and the middle removed so the mat part could lay flat. it was12 inches  to short
B00E1JNNT6|3|Could be better
B00R1JDWPI|2|Buyer beware. Tried to install the two piece unit.  The base does fit a 6mm hole as stated. Had a lot of issues stinking the stem into the base unit. Part will not go in. Had to ream out the hole in the base and taper the end of the stem just to get it to work barely. Went thru 7 stems with 2 bases.  I can see my self running out of stems real quick. Good luck. Only two stars because shipper sent before arrival date. bravo for them.
B0038B325I|5|Saved my truck.  I decided to buy this instead of renting from somewhere because I own 2 4.6l tritons.  The kit is amazingly well engineered and it is hard to mess up the repair.  I highly suggest performing this repair with a borescope.  Again, I highly suggest performing this repair with a borescope.  It just makes it so much easier to see what you are doing and if it is time to move on to the next step.  Low end borescopes are not that expensive and worth avoiding the headache I went through trying to perform this repair without one.  You are still coming out way ahead of buying new heads or paying someone to do this for you.
B00DSD73JW|3|The size is really small
B000CPAELI|5|Solid draw bar works as it should. My minivan had a very low hitch receiver, and this gave me the 6-7&#34; rise that I needed to make my truck bed work trailer lay flat. There was a little bit of room for play, but not much. Every thing felt solid and secure.
B00NBH6814|5|Yes, very bright.  I went with the 9x5730s as this seemed to be the best compromise of light source output versus quantity (based on data sheets).  I haven't done a side-by-side comparison, but I really don't think I need to.  One thing that I was hoping on and didn't get was for the light temperature to be slightly more toward the blue end, as my map lights have a noticeable cool blue hue.  These bulbs are what I believe is referred to as &#34;natural&#34; white (between warm white and cool white).  You can really only see the difference when viewing light sources side by side.  The ambient effect is a wash, so it's really not a big deal.  Also, the dome light housing in our minivan was a bit larger than these bulbs' metal end diameter, which causes the bulb to go out from time to time.  I'll need to get back in there and likely add some copper shims.
B001CF1A7O|5|I like it it does what it needs to do. Painted my d ring red looks great as well
B004BHZR1A|4|I have to admit, these look better than I thought they would, out of the package. I have not applied as of yet as I have a lot more to my master plan for these.
B000LG81R2|5|Needs to be programmed by dealer, not a surprise, my earlier research indicated as much.
B000AP57U8|5|This K&N high flow air filter is simply the best.Increase of power and better acceleration is a matter of fact !
B004ETGQKG|5|So easy to use, saves so much time in the morning to clean off the windshield. I even gave some as gifts. I liked this product a lot & reasonable priced.
B000WEMH4G|4|the ends on the wires are pretty useless for most circumstances, but works great!
B00JMYV23O|1|Cheap, doesn't work, the housing doesn't stick together.
B000BPLNXC|5|This was a great buy. The price was right and it works great! I love the cushioned handle because my hands never got cold while using it and it gripped nicely.
B00G2U0LHY|5|Awesome replacement for my tahoes original reverse lights
B00C25GRI0|5|Works great thus far. It's been three weeks. Easy to install and setup.
B008ZDYLC2|5|now i can look at the codes for all my cars and fix it myself.type the code in Google and see what fixed other people cars with the same make and model.woo savings
B005NLQAHS|4|Works very well, reads everything I need it to. I use the app Torque through the Google Play store ($5 - worth every penny) and paired it with my Google Nexus 10 tablet. In the end, I can take my table with me in the car or out to the parking lot and get real time read outs of my computer system.<br /><br />Not sure if this is the device or the apps fault, but some of the readouts get a little funny, mostly the Horsepower and Torque readouts. In all seriousness, you can't expect a device like this to give you a very accurate power readout, but it's pretty hard to get it going and the numbers are usually pretty random.<br /><br />Also, my first module came completely DOA, would not power on or do anything. Company offers 1 yr warranty, so will be taking care of that.<br /><br />Lastly, this device only READS data from your car, you CANNOT WRITE data to your car. You cannot use this to change values on your ECU, write maps or tunes of any kind. This also means if you leave it plugged in and someone tries to &#34;hack&#34; your Bluetooth, all they'll get are the read out values of your ECU.
B00002243X|2|These jumper cables are not very good.  The wire is Aluminum and the battery clamps are poor quality(steel teeth on one side).  You really have move the clamps around on the battery post to get a good connection.  The two times that I have had to use them I had to grab a DC current meter to check for current flow and then had to playwith the clamps to get a good connection.  Best thing that can be done to this cable set is to cut the ends off and solder on a good set of jumper cable clamps from Napa.  By the time you do that you could have just spent $100 on a much better set of jumper cables.
B001UJB96E|5|These really drink up the water on a car. Work much better than a standard terry cloth towel. Good quality too!
B00BOVSON4|5|Much better than stock at a price hard to beat.had no issue installing and fit perfect.Again a great buy for the quality of brakes
B000SL4A84|5|Just what I needed for the car and for the house
