B0052UZIFA|5.0|Silly as it may sound, I've been significantly out of touch with the gaming world for both voluntary and involuntary reasons. Recently though, a guy I started dating showed me this game on his iPad and I was IMMEDIATELY hooked. I downloaded this game for my iMac and thankfully to him, he sent me the link to download it through Amazon's App store to my t-Mobile G2 android phone. Pop Cap, you guys really have a winner here, I lost a ridiculous amount of sleep over playing this game (once I started winning, I couldn't stop), but it was TOTALLY WORTH IT! :] Can't wait to see what other cool games you have to come out with!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great game, works well on my evo.  just wish there was support for greater resolutions - game looks pretty bad on my gtablet... would be cool to have the zen garden, puzzles, and mini-games of the desktop version
B004GYNPL2|2.0|Very unimpressed. App feels incomplete. Editing custom categories is horrible. Why does it request internet access? Hope dev updates soon else uninstalling. DX
B003UESJH4|5.0|Excellent movie when I saw it in the theater!!!  Had to own it so I could see it again.
0061733199|5.0|I have not read through the entire book, but its a lot of good info here that everyone should be aware of!
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Great psychological, mind-bending movie.  Kept me intrigued throughout the entire movie.  Natalie Portman gave the performance of a lifetime.
076115678X|5.0|Finally someone who knows how to handle curly hair. Recommend it for all curly girls and boys. At least the next generation of curly heads won't have to suffer the same trial and errors we did growing up.
B004GYNPL2|4.0|This app is not perfect but I've been using it on my iPhone for well over a year. I also bought the Windows version when it was brand new for half price. This app has helped me out tens of times when I needed to &quot;remember&quot; a password for something I don't use very often. So glad I got it for free since I've been using Android tablets for a while and consider getting an Android phone as well.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Just bought this for my girlfriend and she feel in love with it. I got it for .99 cent on amazon thank you!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I love the game but everytime I get to level 2-9 and finish it, the next time I start the game it starts all over again. This has happened 3 times already I can only replay it so many times. Other than this glitch the game is amazing, fun for any age. Please bring a THD version out soon!
B004L49K20|5.0|This CD is great if you are a true Duran Duran fan this is the CD for you they go back to their old sound and it is explosive my favorite tracks is all you need is now and girl panic the CD disk is much better than the one produced by timberland he took away there sound what their fans want to hear from them  its great they sound like they did in the eighties if you are a true Duran Duran fan this is the one for you
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Finally on DVD! Leave it up 2 the British 2 create the funniest series ever! I really can't say too much because it speaks 4 itself, this collection is absolutly hilarious that I could not stop laughing! If you love British comedy as much as I do, this DVD is 4 you! Highly recommended 4 any DVD library!
B002ZG9774|5.0|It's not the best movie that's ever been made, but, it's still a good movie. The songs are great! I love them all! The movie it's not boring, actually it's quite entertaining, so you should buy it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's a little like Civilization in that you need to allocate resources between production, offense and defense. It plays pretty fast, though, so you can sneak in a game within 10 minutes.<br /><br />I find it a touch addictive because you can play through a level so quickly, and the game has a great balance of ramping up challenges with giving you new toys to meet those challenges.<br /><br />A+
B0049GYXDG|5.0|What can I say? The movie is a classic, it's my favorite one! It's a must have. The definition it's amazing... The movie it's great as always, it's a great and a epic movie.
B004SBULWE|1.0|I couldn't figure out what was causing my phone to pause between apps until I UNINSTALLED this app. Not only is response time better but my battery appears to be lasting longer. If you have android 2.2 or higher I do not recommend you install it. I now enjoy my phone after removing it. I never thought the application that helped me in the past would cause so much trouble now.
B003WJRW2U|5.0|I bought this to see what all the hype about HTML 5 was, and this book did a good job of explaining it to me without trying to teach me everything I already know about HTML.  You can, of course, you use it to learn a lot more about HTML, but the point is that it's well enough organized that you don't have to.  If only more books were like that.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|While the film involves a gay coming of age story, it is far more than just another genre movie. It's a film about love, family, responsibility, finding one's path in life, and ultimately, about growing up. The production values are very high throughout, with great cinematography, including some amazing shots of surfing.  The script is excellent, avoiding the usual clich&eacute;s and allowing the characters to talk like real people.  The actors do a great job of making the characters come alive as three-dimensional people, where even the less sympathetic characters have redeeming features.<br /><br />Writer/director Jonah Markowitz brings it all together to present a powerful and moving story.  The soundtrack is also well done, with songs that enhance each scene.<br /><br />The DVD has great picture quality and Dolby 5.1 audio.  Extras include a commentary track with Markowitz and the two leads, a \\"making of\\" featurette, a photo gallery, music video of Shane Mack singing \\"Lie to Me\\", and trailer.<br /><br />Highly recommended as an excellent movie with broad-based appeal.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Dragon Tatto is unique, fast moving, compelling, and just plain exciting.  The best of hudreds of books I`ve read since Red Storm Risng. I read it in three days because I could not put it down. Lisbeth is the most unliely hero ever.  The only shortcoming is the number of characters is too large but having said that it is still an easy five star.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This does not work on the Tmobile GSlate Honeycomb 3.0 at is time. However, the Amazon app store still will show you apps at arent supported for your device, so make sure your device is supported befire purchase. Otherwise, I've played this game on PC and it's a blast. Was really looking forward to killing commute time with this on my tablet.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game, works well on the DROIDX (android 2.3).  One pf the best games on the android system.  Easy worthy of $3.00 bucks.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works flawlessly on my Samsung Vibrant. Smooth and no issues.  Loads quickly and play is very responsive. I would definitely recommended!
0060523794|5.0|Great book about unknown world superstars. Lou may not have the fame of Michael Jorden but he was just a big a superstar as him.
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|Item works superfine!!! I purchased a new item from BLUE LIGHT BARGAINS, and the seller sent me a used unit by mistake and we worked to solve the issue!!! So in the end I can tell you this seller is a trustable one, just be sure to contact him if you have any issue with your order before leaving any seller rating....    Getting back to the item review... I'm using this adapter with my macbook pro 2010 with minidisplay port on a Apple 23\\" HD Cinema Display and it works perfectly, it fits great and transmits the signal in the way it is supposed to be!... I was using an generic adaptor and boy there's a difference in using the real apple adapter... so now I know I must keep the original items and throw away all generics... yep, it is a little bit costly, but you get what you are paying for!!! (this time, in a good way!!! hehehe)... So try to lookg for a good price and service (I can recommend you to look for BLUE LIGHT BARGAINS as they provided me an excellent service) and I'm sure you will agree with me!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love this game but when I had beat all the levels in adventure mode it crashed !!!!!!!! It suddenly restarted from the beginning. It did remember my name but all data was lost.
B003L77GH4|5.0|OK so I am a really hard sell.  A little jaded from too many vampire shows.  BUT this is absolutely the best vampire/supernatural show ever.  The actors are all amazing, the chemistry is awesome  and the storyline is absolutely addictive.   It loosely follows the books which I also recommend.  I also watch them as reruns and dont get bored , and i cant remember when ive said that!!! highly recommed the entire series
B004A8ZWSS|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie, particular given the acting talent involved.  I kept waiting for the pace to pick up, but it just kind of plods along.  Some great ideas but poor execution.  Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie manage to keep the viewers interest despite the pedestrian pacing.  I think if lesser actors were involved, this thing could have been unwatchable. Angelina Jolie in particular looks amazing in every scene.  I liked the movie just because of her and because it is set mostly in Venice. Could have been so much better.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Lisa Gardner has become my new favorite author. ALONE was the first one of hers I read. I was captivated from page 1. I even thought I knew what was going to happen, but was I surprised. I can't get enough. I have just downloaded a few more of hers to read.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|the game is awesome on my droid charge, but recently I have been having issues with it starting to run extremely slow and freeze every time I play it... fix please
B004097IKW|5.0|I am, respectfully, going to take a different approach to evaluating this disc. While I have heard Mesdames Callas, Sutherland, Sills, Gruberova, etc., all but the first in performance and in recordings, I do not judge an opera by the way others have sung various roles, but how I react to it as a total performance. As indicated by my five star rating, I enjoyed it a lot!    It never ceases to intrigue me that this piece, first performed in 1835, still captures my total attention. That is the timeless nature of art, I guess, and the same can be said of operas that have stood the test of time. Many composers of the Bel canto period are footnotes to the history of that era; others have an occasional work resurrected once in a while.    The first thing to comment on is not the quality of the singing; I'll get to that. It is that the performers fit the characters they were playing. JDS looked the part of a young soldier; Machaidze looks and acts like the young woman she portrays, etc. In the version with Gruberova, at the time she performed for the disc in 2001, she was 55, and in many scenes looked it.    Vocally, the singing grades go from A+ ( JDF. D'Arcangleo), to A-/B+ ( Machaidze, Gudliardo) to C+ (Viviani). I cannot imagine a better Arturo than that sung and acted by JDF. Bellini wrote for a different kind of tenor voice than that which is today's norm and the demands he makes on the upper range for extended passages have wreaked vocal hardship on such seasoned tenors as Gedda  and even Pavarotti. Jose Bros in the Gruberova version is clearly straining. This is important to me, because the tenor part here is an extended one, and thus as important to the operatic totality as the soprano part.    Machaidze, as others have noted, is a lyric rather than coloratura soprano, and as such has neither the extended range or the flexibility of her sisters in the latter voice category. Yet, to me, she carries off the role very nicely. Her top, while not extended, is secure, and even when I cranked up the volume, I did not notice any of the screaming that other reviewers commented on. What she does do is to capture the essence of Elvira as a character.    And the same is true of Messrs. D'Arcangelo,  Guagliardo and Viviani and Mme. Pirazzini as Enrichetta.  In all, it makes for a credible and enjoyable evening at the opera.    I found that the orchestra and chorus did well, although, as with other reviewers, I questioned some of the camera angles, so the staging is a bit less than perfect from the perspective of the recording. Thae audience seemed taken with the opera as was I.    My disc delivered a crisp consistantly good picture and the effect of the DTS surround sound was simply fantastic. I am waiting for comments from neighbors, because with the onset of warm weather, the windows are open.    In sum, I really enjoyed this performance. I recognize that this is all subjective, but to stage this opera is difficult because of the vocal demands it makes on the cast. I expect that it will not sit and gather dust.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Fun, addictive game.  Unfortunately, it stopped working on my Droid 2 with Gingerbread OS after a few days.  the text became garbled and the graphics were all jumbled, rendering the game unplayable.  Uninstalled.
006112429X|3.0|The author, through Eva, appeared to have a need to convince everyone not only that she was not uneducated, religious, stupid, or fat, or materialistic, but that she was extremely educated, skeptical, brilliant and skinny, with the proper world view, AND that everyone else was just a bit less educated, more gullible, not quite as bright, more overweight, and led a less examined life than she does.    This kind of affliction among  neurotic New York type female writers is soooooo tired and obnoxious, and really interferes with the enjoyment of otherwise excellent novel.  I wish these types would stop trying to impress us by distinguish themselves from others, particularly other women.  No, you're not a uniquely \\"cool\\" and savvy woman in a sea of passive Oprah-watching rubes - you are a dime a dozen so get over yourself.    Otherwise, I enjoyed the subject matter and approach.  Some of the insights were brilliant indeed and the prose impressive, save for the overuse of the thesaurus as others have noted (though it was used effectively in many instances).    Very good novel overall, utterly cliche'd and odious author and narrator.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Good game, but it force closes too many times on the Samsung Vibrant running Gingerbread. Hopefully the devs can fix this because I like playing it
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The title says it all this is the best game for android. Keeps you entertained for hours. Habe had it for a week and still habe a lot of levels to go. Most other games the levels would be over by now. I highly recommend this game to anyone
B00005JNTX|5.0|if you like pulp action or film noir, you will love \\"sin city\\". i read about four of the sin city graphic novels before i saw this flick, and was thoroughly impressed by how closely robert rodriguez followed not only the story lines but also some of the same shots!    rodriguez does not shy away from blood and guts or profanity so be prepared for a very macho approach to story-telling --even when the women are on-screen!    love his work in \\"terror planet\\" and \\"once upon a time in mexico\\", and hope he does many more like those. robert, i am sorry \\"predator\\" failed but it it added little to nothing to the story line. and \\"machete\\" failed because your political opinion is not only out of whack with the VAST majority of Americans in the SW US but it is also not respected, wanted or needed. you're an entertainer, not a political activist.
B0038A4N3O|4.0|I have to say, this might be the best writing that has yet been seen in the \\"Chuck\\" franchise. Brilliant episode! There is new tension between Chuck and Morgan (the resolution of said conflict is bound to be funny) and our two new characters (Shaw and Hannah) are developing nicely. Personally, I prefer Hannah to Sarah. What's so stinking great about Sarah anyway? She's cold and distant, incapable of having a meaningful relationship, and (since this is a major element in the casting) considerably less attractive than Hannah. DOWN WITH SARAH. All in all, an excellent episode.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|After three listens through the whole CD, I was hooked. There is so much FUN to this music. Is it the most epic music? No. She is a fairly new recording artist. She has not been around as long as Madonna. For making so much in so little time, she has skills and more than that, a message: Accept each other.     That is her controversy, not her music. yet here is the beauty of the criticism she is receiving. In her own words, she is \\"being compared to legends.\\" Why isn't it more epic? Wait- you just expected it to be epic. That says something. That says alot.    What do we expect of Britney Spears? Another hit! What do we expect of Katy Perry? Another hit?     What do we expect of Lady Gaga? Revolutionize pop music and our culture.    Wow. That itself is her great impact. And shows no matte what, people will always connect the most with authenticity and individualism. They will always critique the greatest the most. Yet those who just give hits and not true artistry, we expect that. How we settle on product versus art.     The cover of  Born this Way: She is a feminist with activist agendas taking her Little Monsters on the ride of their life. She is not another objectified female. She is beating that system as well.    But I'm not here to glorify Lady Gaga. There are some racial insensitivities on this album: \\"chola\\" and \\"orient-made\\". She gets dirty in the song, \\"Heavy Metal Lover.\\" Speaks of dirtiness in political history past with the song \\"Government Hooker.\\" Her songs sounds similar to others, just rehashed. She, herself, has quoted, \\"A good artist copies. A great artist steals.\\" Meaning- she wants to be like her influends but her own version of it all. Personally, I consider that the melodies are different so it is not stealing.    Gay Rights- she is a big advocate. In Born this Way, she makes that loud and clear. I just think of how many \\"bigots\\" may listen to this song and have their minds changed. How many people decide to become brave and step out of the closet. How people decide on the stance that being gay is something that they were born as and not made into through corruption. How many people will decide that religious institutions can be oppressive and that is not how Lady Gaga views God on any day, \\"God makes no mistakes...I'm on the right track baby I was born to be brave.\\"    She even sympathizes with the bad kids in her song, \\"Bad Kids.\\" I take it as the runaways, the homeless, the angry kids...the key is that she does not judges. Yet many will argue that she condones bad behavior. Still, if we learn to stop judging HER, we may come farther as human beings ourselves. After all, this only art, remember? She has the freedom of speech, remember? She can say what she wants. Yes, she is singing it. And some people need to hear it. Those who get offended can simply wear an \\"ear condom.\\" It's that simple.    This took me back to my high school days of listening to Meatloaf on the school bus and thinking, \\"this is totally epic but nobody gets it anymore.\\" She gets it. She's a rockstar, disguised through pop. That is the genius. She is meant to be bad. She was born that way.    She's a message song writer but she does not sugercoat or come off as all \\"good.\\" That is her appeal. And it works for her. It works for this album too. That's why I gave it five stars.    Oh, and Marry the Night = pure awesomeness. Through all her messages, she reminds us to \\"Just Dance\\" and to \\"find our Jesus in the music\\" even when we are \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" and despite any  \\"Bad Romance\\" that comes our way, it is like how \\"Judas\\" betrayed \\"Jesus\\"- a darkness that occured so that the person betrayed could become what they were born to be= brave. And no matter what \\"poker face\\" we show the world or how much we worship pop songs and \\"Paparazzi\\" there is a \\"Heavy metal lover\\" in all of us that just needs to recognize freedom and fight until the end or \\"Edge of Glory.\\"      -Sarah Browne :)
B003CGOXR0|5.0|\\"It\\" is Stephen King's attempt to write the ultimate horror story, to create a villain more evil and disturbing than any other in literature or film. So how does he do that? By creating a monster capable of making you think that it is your deepest, most terrifying fear, and that it is about to eat you alive. If you're terrorized by movie monsters like the Wolf Man, the Mummy, or the Creature from the Black Lagoon (as kids in the 1950's would have been), it can be any of those. If your fear is disease, it can be a crawling, predatory leper. If spiders horrify you, it can appear as a trance-inducing, 30-foot spider. And all of these forms are underscored by the one all of its victims can see...Pennywise, the murderous, lunatic clown and self-described \\"eternal giant, eater of worlds.\\" Psychic, shape-shifting, carnivorous for human flesh, of otherworldly origins...I don't know what It could be missing in terms of monster qualifications. Add in the Lovecraftian feeding cycle, and you have what I think of as Stephen King's scariest horror novel.<br /><br />As usual, King's strengths, despite his success on a horror genre level, are in writing characters and story. It's impossible not to get close to each character, or not to be compelled by their heartbreak and heroism as both children and adults. Even though it's King's longest novel, it doesn't present the epic journey and quest of The Stand; it's a very personal and private tale of seven different individuals who must conquer separate fears and find inner strength in their own ways. But, they must also strive for unity to accomplish a sanity-threatening feat as a group. Offering the reader both an incredible plot and pure, gut-wrenching horror, It remains one of King's outstanding achievements. Not many horror novels can stand up to it.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I really find suspect the flood of bad reviews here.   mSecure on Android has worked beautifully for me for months,  and it has all of my needs covered.  Data backups to SD,  wireless sync with multiple PCs,  and encrypted backups on PCs,  plus a clean and attractive UI.  Don't believe everything you read,  and try it for yourself.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is amazing! I can listen to this cd over and over again. Her voice is so soulful and pure. Many of the songs have the \\"forlorn lover\\" vibe which I usually find to be depressing but these songs are so beautifully done that I find myself wanting more. Whatever fueled her fire for this album I hope she can channel it again in the future. The only aspect of this album I am not wild about is her rendition of Lovesong, but the rest of the album more than makes up for it! I highly recommend this album!
B004GYNPL2|5.0|this app is great and it seems that someone from keepass is posting a lot of bad reviews on this app which is very suspicious.  talk about bad business ethics.
B00275EGWY|1.0|The hurt locker is terrible.  I'm a infantryman (this is my wife's account) and I've worked with EOD alot in my two tours to Iraq.  Everything is wrong in this movie.  There are no one vehicle patrols.  A single team will never split up to gain more ground.  A intel specialist will never pick up a .50 caliber sniper rifle and pick some one off at over 800 meter. 99% of the time EOD blows the IED in place and they never wear bomb suites.  The infantry in this movie is portrayed laughible inacurate.  We don't hide inside of a courtyard waiting for EOD.  Most of the time, we would dispatch an IED ourselves by shooting it with our .50 cals.  It's not the recommended way of doing things and by no means an SOP, standard operation procedure, yet it is effective.  Afterall, EOD is extremely busy over there being there isn't to many of them, so a wait time could be upwards of 8 hours in Baghdad.  Moving on, A civilian vehicle would NEVER make it past a Checkpoint and if it maintained that speed as it approached the CP, we would have used esculation of force, from warning shots, to disabling the vehicle, to killing if necessary. EOD never travels alone downrange, they are always escorted by a platoon size element for protection.  We don't were badges down range like the combat infantry badge. We don't walk off Base... I could keep going trust me, but I'll leave it there.  However, it digusts me that the people who made this movie told the american people that this it's \\"realistic\\".  It's not, not even close. Hopefully, an Iraq War Veteran will tell their story some day and get it right. This movie is an injustice to those who have served and missleading to those who haven't.
0061767581|5.0|Super deal! I thought getting a hardback book at 40% off was good; these deals blow that away! The book was in brand new condition!
0756404738|5.0|I had a fun moment the other day trying to explain this series to someone else, and doing a truly miserable job of it.  \\"Man in bar tells tales of his own heroic deeds?\\" When I read the first book, I had done so without knowing anything about it.  Having the tale unfold like that was a treat I do not wish to take from others.  So if you can go get a book based on positive reviews alone, I encourage you to do so and stop reading now.    Of course, this is a review for the second book.  If you've read the first one I doubt you're on the fence about reading the second.  If you are, let me reassure you that this is a fantastic book, as good as, if not better, than the first.  The difference here is depth, but depth taken gradually.  Rothfuss introduces us to new parts of Kvothe's world and goes into such detail that you are drawn into it completely.  At the same time, you realize that you've really only scratched the surface of the world, and also that Kvothe is still so incredibly young.  As he's retelling his story they talk of his current age being mid-20's?  By the end of this book I think Rothfuss is still about ten years behind Kvothe's current age.  There's a lot of story left to tell.    And truth be told, that's just getting you to the Inn.  It's my hope that Rothfuss uses this trilogy as the introduction to these characters, and then begins the epic tale from there.
0061928356|3.0|I really wanted to like this book and I can see I'm in a small minority in giving it only three stars. It was a very well written story, for the most part, with a very compelling subject matter (one that has always interested me) and a very satisfying ending. But I did have several problems with it that prevents me from reviewing it highly.    I found the first maybe two thirds of the novel difficult to get through, because it just seemed to be an endless list of misery after misery. This does make it a little hard to root for the characters, especially since most of the misery seems to be self-generated. The author tells us that Kris and Somer were once happy together, but all we really see of their relationship is resentment and distance and a shocking inability for either one of them to even attempt to understand one another. Somer seems completely unwilling to embrace Kris's Indian culture or to understand why he wants to have anything to do with it. She won't even do him the small kindness of learning to cook a few Indian dishes. Kris, on the other hand, doesn't seem to understand why Somer feels so uncomfortable in India, and he doesn't take a single step to help her acclimate or to show her any of the positive aspects of his country. Even after the adoption, everyone seems miserable. Later in the book we are told how much Somer loves Asha, her adopted daughter. But all we are ever shown prior to that point is her resentment, her feelings of being an outsider in her own family, and her unwillingness to understand why Asha is interested in knowing something--anything--about her birth parents, and, yes, her regret at ever having adopted in the first place.    The parallel story of Asha's birth parents is almost more difficult to swallow, though I give it the benefit of the doubt because I am not Indian and the only Indians I've ever known are those who emigrated to America from privileged Indian families. But after Kavita's husband Jasu murders their first child, I can't believe that she would forgive him as quickly as she does. Although that may just be a part of the culture, I don't know. But I can't ever like Jasu again through the whole story and that makes it hard for me to relate to their family, even considering all the terrible things that happen to them after that.    There seem to be two themes going on in this book. In the first, I think the author wants us to see the \\"two Indias:\\" the horrible poverty that Kavita's family has to endure and the lavish lifestyle of Kris's upper class family. The second is a family theme: \\"At some point the family you create is more important than the one you're born into.\\" So in wanting to convey these two themes, I'm not sure there's anything the author could have done about my last gripe, and that is that I think she ignored one of the fundamental realities of Indian adoption: the caste system. Now, please someone correct me if I'm wrong but I've read that adoption is problematic within Indian families because the caste system is still very much alive and well; once you're born into a caste, there's nothing you can do to get out of it ... which is why higher-caste families don't like to adopt if they have no way of knowing which caste the adopted baby came from. So I really doubt that Kris's traditional mother would be so accepting of his decision to adopt a baby, who obviously was from a different caste though I don't think anyone would have been able to discover which one. But the subject is never brought up and Asha's grandmother accepts her just as if she was a biological grandchild--which obviously is the way it should be, although sadly I don't think this is usually a reality in India. Perhaps Kris's family is just very modern? Still, I don't think the issue should have been completely ignored, even though it would have made the novel's themes difficult to maintain.    The story did redeem itself at the end. Asha proved to be a very likeable character (though I did have ahard time believing she could have located her birth parents so quickly and easily in a country of one billion people). And the ending of the novel, which I won't give away, was very sweet and satisfying. Still, I don't think it was enough to overcome the other complaints I had about the story.
B001TH16DI|5.0|First off I got the blu ray collection for under $44, was supposed to be used, arrived sealed, new. What a deal! I've seen these movies in the theater as well as on all available versions of VHS and DVD media more than a few times over the years. This blu ray collection is light years better than ANYTHING previously available, clarity, color, sound are all astounding. I have a very good TV and sound system, if you have hesitated to buy the blu ray due to negative reviews here, DON'T! Too many silly folks have picked these apart for no sound factual reason. YES....Perhaps better versions will be released later,someday, just like all re-releases end up doing, but this collection is NO disappointment. Shop careful like I did and save some $$$, you will do well!
0066620996|5.0|\\"Good is the enemy of Great,\\" this statement appears early in Jim Collins' Good to Great and continues as the main theme of the work.  Collins' stresses the important difference between a company which is merely good and one that is truly great.  More importantly, he and his team identify though years of research, how a company can make the transition from one state to the other and identifies eleven companies that have succeeded in this feat.  Reading through the book it was impressive to see each of the principles present themselves in the history of each company, regardless of industry.  For example, Walgreens is one of the companies selected in the technology accelerators chapter.  High tech may not be a term most people would associate with a corner drugstore, they may more readily think of other featured manufacturing companies such as Nucor or Gillette.  Walgreens turned out to be one of the most technologically advanced companies though with their interconnected stores and satellite   network.      A huge amount of value can be taken from the principles in this book by anyone at any level of leadership in a company or organization.  Managers and CEOs will learn what type of person they need to be to successfully lead their companies.  Boards of directors will learn the very important lesson of picking a level five leader such as Kimberly-Clark's Darwin Smith rather than a charismatic, rock star CEO.  Lower level employees will learn what will be expected from them as members of a great company and that even their actions and attitudes can affect the company.    Some many question the finding of Collins and his team due to the current state of some of the companies, specifically Circuit City and Fannie Mae.  Circuit City met all of the qualifications for the list at the time of the study but has since declared bankruptcy and liquidated.  Their board decided to fire all of the executives responsible for the transition and also got rid of employee commissions.This actually further proves the point of the book, when they lost their entire transition team, Circuit City failed.    Reading this as a student, I know what aspects to look for in a company as I search for a job in the coming year and I hope one day to be able to effectively implement these strategies at a company.
B004GYNPL2|4.0|Yesterday, I upgraded my Evo to Gingerbread. After the update, the password manager that I was using wouldn't even open. I was perturbed. This morning I checked the Amazon free app of the day, and saw this. I downloaded it, and am in the process of retreiving all of my passwords one by one to enter in to this app.<br /><br />This app has many customizable categories, many of which I will never use. So, I just delete the entire category. This app is EXTREMELY customizable.<br /><br />I really don't see what there is to dislike about this very useful app.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I always go for characters that... show me that I'm not alone?  People like to tell me that I'm harsh, but I like to think that I'm just being honest. I've missed this show soooo much. Granted I was the kid who got yelled at for hanging out with 'weird' kids. And for reading books outside of reading group.  Or correcting the teacher's poor grammer.<br /> It was nice to have someone to look up to who was remotely my age instead of like.... some.. QUINN type, or an older woman. I had a teenage girl who I identified with for once.. and that was important.

B000GW8RX4|1.0|rateing you culd give this DVD. C'mon you hate rock or what?? (Welcome all 5  star raters who are looking to see who the a+__)hole is who gave this 1 star) You have 2 of the all time greats in Rickie and Ronnie- if thats not good for you I referr you to the country or classical music section of this site. The sound- all I can say is thank you very much. its not really unlike Cream or Led sepplin (was thinking of correcting that- but It'll prorbably drive someone mad). Is Rainbow already considered \\"Classic Rock\\"?? Frankely I never heard of them till about '81 I went to a party w a co worker who also played Bass in a metal band (locally pretty popular). At the time I was a few thousand miles away from home survivelin on my own for the first time, I knew the music I knew- but this seems to me to fit the classic rock catogory.Ronnie James Dio and Rickie Blackmore- I think thats 2 of the best Its all rock and Roll to me one pianist said. Oh And I love the e-mails from people who think because I missspell I must not be able to critically appreciate a piece of music- That is SOWISE. I just cant se how anybody who doesnt enjoy- and therefore have a purpose in buy this- would think this is anything but EXCELLANT. If you sont like this kind of music then YES you probably wont like thisput all your comments in a bag labeld I REALLY DONT CARE- and mail them to me. ENJOY

0393307050|5.0|William F Buckley, Jr. declared they are \\"cocaine for the intellectual mind\\" and the New York Times book reviewer Richard Snow wrote that Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin naval adventure novels are \\"the best historical novels ever written.\\"  Also consider: \\"The best sea story I have ever read.\\" Sir Francis Chichester.  And in a Washington Post article published August 2, 1992, Ken Ringle wrote, \\"The Aubrey/Maturin series far beyond any episodic chronicle, ebbs and flows with the timeless tide of character and the human heart.    Myself - I felt like I had found an endless electrical charge. The first book, Master & Commander, is a difficult book to get into. I'll say that right up front. There are actually two books you need to have by your side. 1) Cross Section of a Man of War\\" by Stephen Biesty and \\"2) A Sea of Words\\" by John B. Hattendorf. O'Brian plops you right down on a fighting ship in 1792 and does not explain anything to you. I had to read some paragraphs several times but the words and syntax are so beautiful and the story and characters so incredibly rich I am thrilled I did. I have read all the volumes and then read them again.    My son, as a teenager, tried several times to read M&C and just gave up. Then when he was about 20 he decided to try again and was totally hooked. I would only let him have 2 or 3 books at a time and he had to return what he had finished to my library shelves. When he finished #11, I got the next two down and he sadly refused them. When I asked why, he replied \\"Patrick O'Brian is dead now and there won't be any more books. I'll need to parcel these out sparingly.\\" So after he'd read several other books, he would take one Patrick O'Brian book out to savor.    Nothing else like them! Wonderful ain't in it. You will carry these people in your heart forever.
B0052U59F4|4.0|It was really hard for me to put this book down. After I started reading it I realized that I had read this story before when it was on fanfic. I was glad to see that someone on fanfic actually had their story published. This story kept me intrigued from start to finish and I cannot wait for part 2 to come out. However, I do have to say that there were a couple of things that I noticed in the book that I did not like. I was not impressed that a book with so many grammatical errors was not edited (or appeared to not have been edited) before being published. I think getting a book published is a \\"big deal\\" and so before getting the book out to readers the book should be as close to perfect as possible. On fanfic I do not mind the errors because it is expected but in a published book there is no excuse for so many errors. Now, about Jose, I did not like that the use of the spanish language in this book. My native language is spanish (I was boen in Puerto Rico). I noticed a part where Jose calls Ana \\"carina\\" and I am sure that the correct word is \\"carino\\" which is a term of endearment like \\"sweetheart\\" and \\"carina\\" actually means nothing in the spanish language. Also, it was annoying how much Jose says \\"Dios mio\\" or something like that (I can't remember). I honestly felt like Jose was gay and it was hard to imagine him as a straight handsome Hispanic-American man. Anyway, aside from the grammatical errors I loved and enjoyed this book. I wish I could say more about the parts that I liked but I do not want to spoil it for those who have not read this story yet. If you have not read this story buy it, you'll enjoy it. It will definately keep you reading for hours trying to figure out the deep that secrets of Christian Grey. The author did an amazing job with this character.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is SO fantastic. So fun just to pull it out for a quick level during lunch at work or somewhere else. Here's the annoying problem I found though. I was about 10 levels into the game (night levels) and right as the level started I got a phone call. I wasn't even on the phone for a minute and when I got off it had to reload the entire game and my progress was completely lost. No matter how many times I restarted the app it never came back up. This should definitely be fixed. Other than that things run smoothly and I'm enjoying it a lot!! Especially since I got it on the day it was free! Thanks amazon :)
B001DMJ9VA|5.0|Very cool to see Rod and Ronnie interact.   I loved hearing all those old songs.  You really see the passion that Rod brings to his songs, he really gets into a song for his wife.  His band sounds great ,  Great guitars , great backup vocals.  All around an awesome look at Rod Stewart up close and personal.  Rod can barely sit down when he performs.  This shows you how really good Rod Stewart and his band mates are.  You gotta get this and crank it.....
0307477479|3.0|There's no doubt Jennifer Egan is a gifted writer of adult fiction, that she has wonderful skills at characterization, and that she's always moving forward as a literary craftsman. Given that conviction, I simply could not read this book. Bennie and Sasha are fascinating characters, and the suggestion that me might better understand them by exploring their earlier lives in a discontinuous way simply didn't work.  Time is an element that very few contemporary novelists handle as gracefully as they could.  Perhaps the most successful attempt at telling a cohesive story and moving forward and back in time, is Kurt Vonnegut's SLAUGHTERHOUSE FIVE.  Granted, one premise of Vonnegut's novel is that time is discontinuous, and that we can understand the life of any fictitious character is many ways other than pure chronology. The meaning and purpose of lives emerge in a discontinuous way.    But this award-winning novel, after the first 50 or so pages, was simply unreadable. Every writer is a storyteller and, to some degree, a guide. At a point at which form completely overtakes content, the story vanishes. Ms. Egan might have created a very great book here, and the Pulitzer committee concurs that she did.  But for a typical, educated, fair-minded reader, the rep doesn't justify the read in this case.    I've seen too many tremendous books fall by the wayside, books by authors with far less potential than Ms. Egan. As Emily Dickinson and her mentor claimed, \\"Publishing is the auctioning of the human mind.\\"  In this case, the buyer gave up, and also gave this book away.    Life is short. Don't rely on medals and awards.  Rely on great work.  Three stars for writing quality and the author's ambition.  But barely three.
B002VPE1YS|5.0|This case works perfect for my Nikon Coolpix camera; I feel like my camera is well-protected. At around $5, the case is quite affordable- always a plus! I also like that the case has a carabiner on it, which makes it easy to attach the case to a belt loop or a purse strap.<br /><br />Watch the size of the object- a GPS will not fit in this case. It's roughly 6 inches long and 3 1/2 inches wide.

014241543X|4.0|When I first read the synopsis I thought it was short and didn't offer much information, but I read the book anyway because I had heard good things about it. I'm so glad I did! This is one of those books that readers are better off not knowing the plot, the synopsis tells you all you need to know before you read it. Mia and her family are in a car accident and the next thing she knows she is standing near the crash site watching everything that happens afterwards.<br /><br />And what happens afterwards is very vivid and emotional. Ms. Forman does a fantastic job of capturing the mood and feelings of Mia's family and friends as they deal with the tragedy. Along with tears though I found myself laughing at times when Mia has flashbacks to her life before the accident. I am a music junky and I absolutely LOVE when stories include music and this book shows all the different ways music impacts people's lives whether it's a way of life for them, it's a passion, it's healing, or it unites people. This book shows it all. It's through Mia's flashbacks that we learn more about her and her family and I felt like I knew them at the end of the book.<br /><br />This was a quick read at less than 300 pages and it was a page turner. There was never a dull moment or skimming with this one. I'm sure some readers will have more of a connection with this book than I did, especially if they have been in the same position as Mia's family. The emotion level at times is high and I took a break afterwards to spend time with my own family. This book does a great job at dealing with the topics of death and grieving. I highly recommend this read to everyone.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i dont know anyone that even got this to load. Also might make sure youre on wifi since its a 76mb dl... would be nice if they told you that first too. if you ever get it running its a decent tower defense but nothing that thrilling. over hyped and android version is buggy as hell.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game was a total pain to download (My phone is still new to me- so most likely user error)- but once that is accomplished, it is awsome!! Lots of fun and very addicting. I was lucky to see this on the day it was offered for free, but would have even been happy with it if it had cost money. This is my 9 year olds favorite game. Have to fight to get my phone back from him now!!!
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|I like \\"Up\\". The things it does well, it does extremely well. Its \\"sad\\" scenes, the ones centering on Carl's (voiced expertly by Ed Asner) personal journey of dealing with loss and recognizing the facade of his childhood dreams, are really quite beautiful and unreservedly recommended.    The other stuff, however... Well, at the risk of making a pun, it could've probably used a little more time on the drawing board. Dug the dog, for instance, does a Stimpy voice that proved the be the bane of my existence during the scenes in which he is prominent. Be you 5 or 50, there's just nothing cool or funny about a Stimpy voice, and it killed a lot of the already spread-too-thin comedy of the film.    Speaking of 5 or 50, this film is directed at kids, but I would advise parents to watch it first to determine how they feel about it before sharing it with the younger set. I know it's a Pixar cartoon, and Pixar cartoons are universally assumed to be kids' movies, but this film has absolutely NOTHING to do with childhood. As I mentioned, it's about dealing with loss and recognizing the facade of childhood dreams. Are these really problems that kids face? Perhaps I define \\"kids' movie\\" differently than some, but I just wonder if I were to rotoscope \\"Chinatown\\" and run commercials for it during reruns of \\"Wizards of Waverly Place\\" whether or not it would be hailed as a kids' movie. I see the distinction thematically, not aesthetically, is all I'm saying, and I would advise parental discretion.     As for a specific recommendation, my take is that this is not a film that needs to be watched over and over again. While it is good enough to watch once, a DVD or Blu-Ray copy of the film would be extraneous and would inevitably end up just collecting dust on the shelf, with each glance in its direction conjuring memories of the film's weaker moments rather than its strengths.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|It won't install even after reboot. Tried unmounting and still nothing. Guess I didn't want to try it after all.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|**WARNING: SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW***<br /><br />I grew up with the X Men cartoons- ah, the childhood memories. I remember reading the comics and wishing I was as cool as Magneto, Wolverine, Beast, etc. I remember when X Men 1 came out... and oh man it was F'ing cool. I wanted to be like Wolverine. I loved that Cyclops' name was Scott. I got it on VHS for Christmas and I was 9 years old. I think I nearly wore out the tape!!!<br /><br />X2 was probably the best of the original trilogy, in my opinion. It was the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd pleasing. When X3 came out, I was excited... but was so disappointed when I went and saw it. What happened? Who were all these random mutants??? What purpose did they serve? Why was all this story crammed in? And X Men Origins ran the franchise even further into the ground. Quite frankly I was done with the X Men franchise by then.<br /><br />And then, ANOTHER X Men movie gets made. Oh dear. A PREQUEL???? George Lucas made 3 tragedies that were prequels. But wait... Michael Fassbender is in it, as is James MacAvoy!!! And it's directed by Matthew Vaughn. That's when I decided, OK, I'll start taking this movie seriously now. And then I saw the trailer... I was excited... This is the X Men I want to see.<br /><br />And believe me. This movie ROCKED. Me being the geek I am, I went and saw it today. And trust me, it does NOT disappoint! X2 was my favorite of the series, but it looks like I have to reconsider. I'm not kidding, this movie is what I wanted to see after X2.<br /><br />This is, as I stated, a prequel. The first half may disorient you a little- it focuses mainly on Erik and Charles. We learn of Erik's childhood in Nazi-occupied Poland, and how he came to terms with his magnetic powers. Whereas Charles, the man with clearly the better childhood, comes to terms with his mind reading abilities. We follow them through thick and thin- Charles' academic ventures and relationship with Raven and Erik's vengeful outings. We do see them meet, one night when Erik unsuccessfully tries to stop Sebastian Shaw, the film's villain, and his crew.<br /><br />This leads to the meetings with a few Youth with mutant powers. Raven, who can turn into another person easily is automatically in, we have a scientist with feet that can grab, a woman with firefly wings, A man with a sonar, a man who can adapt, another man who can wreak havoc with some destructive powers. This leads to Charles' creation of a school for these people, so they can prepare for their part in the Cuban Missile Crisis- a crisis fronted by Shaw.<br /><br />Honestly... wow. I can't believe I actually liked a new X Men movie for once. At 132 minutes, not a single moment is wasted. The movie moves at an effective enough pace- equal amounts of action and character are to be found. There is a lot of great humour too, and the climax in Cuba is one intense nail biter. And they managed not to screw up the character arcs- except the fact that Charles loses his walking ability in the 60s yet at the beginning of X3 he can be seen standing. But that movie fracked lots of arcs up anyways, so I don't count it.<br /><br />The acting is PHENOMENAL. Fassbender gives quite possibly the performance of a lifetime. His controlled rage and mannerisms are just... BRILLIANT. He manages to nail the role completely and carry the film in the palm of his hand. MacAvoy surprised me big time here as well and excelled as Charles. And Kevin Bacon was fantastic as Shaw. Honestly I can't think of a single bad performance, all were great.<br /><br />In short, this film is the movie that defines \\"Awesome summer movie\\". It is the perfect mix of fanservice and crowd-pleasing. Even if you don't like X-Men you will still love this movie. By far the best movie of 2011!!!<br /><br />OVERALL: 10/10<br /><br />PROS:<br />-Awesome script<br />-Lots of action<br />-Amazing performances<br />-Great pacing<br />-Not a second wasted<br /><br />CONS:<br />-...uuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhh...
B00122Z5RI|5.0|I still feel this is one of the best recordings of all time.  I won't bother to repeat all of the positive comments that came before me because I pretty much agree with all of them.    I can never forget first getting into this album. I was about 15 years old (yeah, this was soon after the album became available in the states) and I had a really crappy \\"stereo\\", basically a turntable with built in speakers. The distortion was pretty awful at high volume so you can well imagine what \\"Never Mind...\\" would have sounded like.     I was cranking it out after school one afternoon and my mother was out shopping or something. My father came home from work unexpectedly early. He burst into my room hollering like all hell \\"I thought you were taking a chainsaw to your bicycle frame up here!!!\\". I played the album over and over and over (wore it out in less than a year). One day, I caught my father singing some of the lyrics to \\"No Feelings\\". To achieve that kind of endorsement from someone who had to tolerate bobbysoxer \\"dolls\\" says something...the melodic hooks are undeniable beneath that buzzsaw.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|Doesn't even let me install app. Kinda glad since its got such horrible reviews already. Plus I agree, leaving all your sensitive passwords ext ext with a third party company. I'll pass.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Unlike the of version,  there's no challenge mode. Which sucks because once you finish campaign, that's it.  Also note supporting the original droid is a slap in the face to those who gave Android its first big push.  My droid 1 is running 2.3.3 at 1.2 GHz,  so some of us have droids that will do more.  Just saying no is a bad stance,  I'd rather have them say 'might suck on droid' than 'we give up on early adopters' (sorry g1 folks,  but tmobile isn't big enough to count,  you're more beta testers)

B0042EJD8A|5.0|I map out the Northern Tier of PA and have logged 5100 miles as of today just in the northern tier of PA and I link dirt road together on my stret legal dirt motorcycle and the destruction that i have watched occur as i go into my 3rd year of doing this is beyond description.  Now please do not get me wrong, I am not a green freak and i am in no way a Sierra Clubber and in fact those people are the most hypocritical of all.  When they flip their switch on in their massive  homes or turn the key of their Range Rover's they think the energy that is required grows on the tree out back.  BUT BUT BUT this hydraulic fracking is a real bad system they are using.  It makes no sense because the chemicals used have to go somewhere and when the rock layers are shattered its bound to end up in water supplies.  I know we need energy but this is a sloppy system and not well researched.  The gas is there and it will be there so lets sit back and find a better way.  Use it sure but do not destroy pound for pound the most beautiful state in the entire 50 states.  I  have been in 40 of them and PA is the overall most wild and beautiful of them all.  The Northern Tier is so accessable but so untouched its beyond description and 99% of PA residents have no idea how unbelievable and wild this state is.  I am determined to become the ONE person in this state that sees and experiences and actually travels on more acres than any other person living here and I want to see it kept pristine.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|I always like Zeppelin.  Cool lyrics and a tight sound.  But I had always heard what an awesome guitarist Jimmy Page was.  He's okay, I'd think, but Hendrix, Eddie Van Halen, Stevie Ray Vaughn and Eric Clapton all blow him out of the water.  I thought this for years.  Not that I was dissin' Page, I just didn't get the accolades people gave him.  Then I watched this DVD.  Jimmy Page smokes, dude.  I didn't know how I missed it.  Zeppelin were always in my top 5 favorite bands, but after watching this I'm gonna have to go back and listen to all their records again and pay close attention to Page and less to the lyrics.  Anyone who likes classic rock needs to watch this DVD.  And dig Jimmy Page playing his guitar with a violin bow.  Awesome.  And then you get John Bonham's Moby Dick.  Damn. Totally 5 stars.  Get this DVD today if you're a fan.

B004SBQAL0|4.0|After reading the book (which is awesome by the way) I purchased the movie. The acting is good and the special effects and fight scenes are good. The problem i have is that some of the rewrites from the book make no scene what so ever. Changing things from book to movie is important but changing alot of stuff isnt. If you have read the book just know that the action scene at the end isnt as long or strategic in the movie instead its shorter and faster pace. Also they never mention Home Ec class in the movie which is a big mistake because its an important part of John and Sarah's relationship. If you havent read the book then its a typical teenage highschool movie but in a Scifi enviornment.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|Honestly? 4star app due to some of the earlier mentioned issues. (Unencrypted csv, and bonjour requirements) However, ranking it a 5 to offset all the jerks ranking it a 1.  My suggestion is that most people that are debating on getting this app, read the reviews for it on the original android market. The reviews there are much more accurate, and you don't have to worry as much about shills intentionally down ranking the score. Shame on you for letting this happen, Amazon.
B004DL5K2K|4.0|I picked up the much anticipated re-release of Ozzy's classic album (and arguably one of metal's greatest albums of all time) \\"Blizzard of Ozz\\" today.  After listening to the album, I have to say, in my humble opinion, the remastered sound of the 2011 version is not as good as the 1995 version.  The 2011 version is still pretty decent, as you do hear more bass presence and overall audio quality sounds clean and there are subtle more details, however, where this version falls short is the volume and treble level.  To my ears, the sound was cranked a bit too high.  No disrespect to Senior Mastering Engineer, George Marino, but he seem to have fallen to the loudness war. The album has been too compressed (much akin to 2002 Tribute album and in a way, like Metallica's Death Magnetic).  For instance, when you hear Ozzy's famous scream of the introduction to Crazy Train, as well as whenever his vocal level rises, it sounds too harsh with too much evidence of treble.  Come to think of it, his vocal sounds similar to the 2002 horrible remasters.  The drumming suffers as well (sounds annoyingly loud and tiny).  This is also true, regretfully, with Randy's solos for Crazy Train and Mr. Crowley, among other songs.  I've played the CD on my car stereo system and have found the need to decrease the treble setting because the songs create a static noise to the right side of the car speaker when played loud, and my ear I might add.  This is not the case with the 1995 remaster which sounds smoother and warmer like a high quality LP; in other words, there are more depth and dynamic of the songs. But I'll let you be the judge on which version is better, as sound quality can be very subjective.  I'm just glad I still have the original 1995 Blizzard, Diary, and Tribute remasters.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so much fun that I just cant stop playing it! I have not found any bugs in it or had any glitches in any way but even if I did I would still give it a good rating. The only complaint I could possibly have is that there should be more levels.

1595141979|4.0|Sometimes at the third book in the series, the author starts to lost steam and not do as well with the plot. This one is very good and keeps you wanting to find out what is going on with the characters.
B0041T4ML4|3.0|While the world as described by the author is well told and rich, the characters themselves leaves much to be desired. I never really found myself pulling for anyone in the book.    There is Anderson, the company man. The outsider with no interest in assimilating, in fact his only interest is making a profit. He bites into the world presented in the book with the same ruthlessness as he does the fruit he eats throughout the story. The only reason I remember his name at all is because it is repeated so many times in the book. Does the story revolve around hi  ? The title certainly does not refer to him (obviously).    There's... Jaidee. The fighter turned soldier. The wolf in... errr wolf clothing. Then there's that she-wolf that follows him around.     Finally there's the windup girl for whom this book was named for. She of smooth skin and fair complexion successfully manages to ensnare everyone in her sexy-submissive feminine wiles. Innocent, pure and yet oh so deadly. Think Leeloo Dallas of the Fifth Element movie only haltingly moving as if in perpetual strobe lights.    They all come together and then... the ever tightening knot of these characters don't get any tighter. At least it does not unravel.     Yes, everything I've written above looks mighty negative. This is only because you can tell that the author is so talented and can give so much more. The potential of the world created is promising. You just know there's more of the characters to explore. The technology, the politics, the American corporations.     Buy this book. There are so many good things about it to justify the price. Although not perfect, buy this book because there is a lot of heart in the writing and because you'll want to see more from this author as he masters his craft.
142313494X|4.0|Like a magic spell the book will haul you in and leave you star struck. You will be transfixed on its sensational depiction of compassion, suspense and action. With immaculate story line and fluent flow, the book brings the simplicity of words to life. Its alluring moments of deep thought can instantaneously change to accelerating action. The suspense will lift you off your seat. The book will jostle your mind, forcing your mind into a state of discombobulation, filled with questions. You will be thrown by the story to and fro. Percy Jackson, the son of the majestic sea god, Poseidon, journeys to distant lands fighting gods and goddesses for humanity. He and his companions challenge some of the fiercest creatures in Greek mythology. If you like action, history, mythology or thrilling sensations racing through your mind, this is the book for you.

B003UESJH4|5.0|That 4-word sentence is the spine-tingling climax of the movie, a quote that's in some respects the equivalent of Terry Malloy's finding his own voice in the famous cab scene from \\"On the Waterfront\\": \\"I could have been a contender instead of a lousy bum, which is what I am.\\"  Of course, the words alone betray the surface meaning and ensure that we see through them to the person (Marlon Brando) who now emerges as a true champion, like King George VI ready to right the wrongs done him by his older brother (Rod Steiger) and set right the injustices of both his personal past and a perilous present.<br /><br />Both statements in both movies occur under the most intimate circumstances, the words escaping the person who utters them to his surprise and only one listener.  When they are subsequently \\"validated\\" in public at the end of both movies, the acts are admittedly anticlimactic but not overly so.  The King's final action is at once spoken as personally as to one friend (his speech therapist) and his many new friends (the British nation); Brando's final action is on behalf of his murdered brother and his fellow waterfront workers.  His final \\"bout\\" (with Lee J. Cobb) is off-screen but nevertheless felt as a victory because of Leonard Bernstein's score, just as it is largely the film score (more than the spoken words) that leave no doubt about the King's conclusive, and again heroic, personal and public, success.<br /><br />Another memorable \\"speech\\" moment: never has the \\"F\\" word (or for that matter the \\"S--t\\" word) been so exhilarating in film, ranking with Gable's sensational (and at one time even censored) \\"Damn\\" in \\"Gone with the Wind.\\"<br /><br />The \\"King's Speech,\\" then, is in good company.  And you will be too (all the more so upon recognizing the fear we all experience upon undertaking an action that raises doubts about our ability to perform it not to mention our life-long search for an authentic voice we can claim as our own).  The fear of public speaking is not only universal but often claimed to be rank second to no other--this film makes it understandable.ut often claimed to be rank second to no other--this film makes it understandable.
1594202842|1.0|I had heard some of the controversy about the author's parenting style on the radio and was curious because of some of her \\"Rules\\" particularly no playdates.   I do not believe in drop off playdates and thought I might find some common ground with the author but found her to be ridiculous and possibly not credible.  For all the time she supposedly spends monitoring her children's music lessons and practice and drilling them in multiplication as well as holding down a full time job as a Yale professor, she would not have time to sleep.  And does she really keep pre-teens up till midnight to practice?  Even if it is all true, I found it ironic that her husband, whose parents were obviously more laid back than hers landed the Yale professor job way before her.    In addition I did not find the book particularly well written.  What was her point really anyway?  She maintains throughout the book that \\"Chinese Parenting\\"  is superior yet acknowleges the failures with her younger daughter.  So what is she really trying to say with the book?  Just that Chinese Parenting exists?   Is threatening to burn your child's stuffed animals if they don't get a piano lesson perfect the sign of a stable person?

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|If you want an escape from reality that is enjoyable and mentally stimulating, you're looking at the right video.<br /><br />The setting dealing with turn-of-the-century illusionists lead to the inevitable comparison between this and \\"The Prestige.\\" Aside from that, it's like comparing apples with oranges, Moby Dick with Jaws, fruit salad with a hot fudge sundae. These two movies have two different purposes and two different world views. Both succeeded equally well at what they aimed at accomplishing.<br /><br />I recently read \\"Saving Leonardo\\" by Nancy Pearcey, where she follows two differing philosophical trends: the Enlightenment tradition and the Romanitic tradition. \\"The Illusionist\\" fits clearly into the Romantic setting. The rational explanation of what is going on is not important. The protagonist left the explanation for a trick for the antagoist (a superb job by Paul Giamiati), but the audience never knows how plausible that is. Some of the effects in fact cross into the spiritual/magical realm.<br /><br />The philosophy also reveals itself in the story telling. This movie has a very identifiable hero, villain, love-interest, and antagonist. The purpose of this movie is to be an old-fashioned romantic story, without any real agenda than being an enjoyable couple of hours. The only complaints is that this reflects a modern view of morality, where there's no problem with the hero having sex with the love interest without being married to her, as well as some occultish tones.<br /><br />\\"The Prestige\\" is much more realistic than the \\"Illusionist\\", and I personally consider it to be the better movie. It made you think more. It also was darker and more depressing. \\"The Illusionist\\" was more enjoyable.

B004HO6HWA|4.0|Plenty of action with a good storyline. However, this movie falls short of the original-titled film starring Charles Bronson and Jan-Michael Vincent.For the most part it was very entertaining. Most women would probably not enjoy this flick.
B000UX6THK|5.0|I do so love television. I enjoy it far more than film (IE: movies) as I feel that the stories and characters have more room to grow when not restrained by a pithy two hour run time. And my all time favorite television show (and one of two things I can really call favorite) is 'Twin Peaks'.<br /><br />'Twin Peaks' began as nothing more than experimental foray by David Lynch into the world of television but it grew into something so much more. The show became a complex series of ever evolving twists, plot threads interwoven to form a unique, and at times bizarre, kaleidoscopic vision. It's true that due to mandate by the shows' distributer, CBS, Lynch was forced to reveal the murderer of Laura Palmer, the main mystery at the core of the whole series, only halfway through its' run, which then caused many subplots to be spun together and restructured to fit this revelation, the show still flourished and stands today as one of televisions' most evocative and memorable events.<br /><br />In other words, I'm a Peaks Freak.<br /><br />But, really, the only people who are going to purchase the 'Twin Peaks' Gold Edition Box Set are fans. I can't see anyone else spending $50 to $89 dollars on such a set, let alone on this show in particular. So really, lets actually review the product for once, shall we?<br /><br />I love this set. If you love 'Twin Peaks', the set is absolutely perfect. The entire series, from the feature length pilot to the stunning finale, is here, digitally remastered and are presented in picture perfect quality, with the option to watch them with or without the famous Log Lady intros, which I found to be a very nice touch. Plus there's a ton of deleted scenes, offering a either a new look at old scenes or (even better) adding a bit to 'Twin Peaks' mythos. Sights Unseen and Sounds Unheard indeed.<br /><br />There's also a bevy of bonus features, all of which are damned good. Rare photos, behind the scenes looks, a full length documentary, an interactive map of the town, the famous Kyle MacLachlan monologue and Twin Peaks comedy sketch from SNL, and much more. Seriously, there are hours, HOURS, of bonus features here. You could buy this box set for the specials alone. And all of it has a wonderful personal touch to it since David Lynch helped to organize it all.<br /><br />In summary, if you're a Peaks Freak like me, then the Definitive Gold Box Edition is most certainly for you. It gives the whole series and some major 'Twin Peaks' bonus content to keep you content for hours. If you're not a familiar with the show, I'd recommended watching the pilot on CBS.com to get your bearings before picking this up. If you like, it's totally worth it.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|but this book was a recommendation from a podcast I listen to.  I'd give it an elaborate review, but I couldn't wait to get back to a PC.   In short, this book is awesome.  it is hard to tell what is fiction and what is real.  Even though this book has all of the makings of a great novel, it is unique in the fact that is all technically sound and feasible.  Great read!

0312323867|3.0|Something better, finally came out! I will admit that I got on the bandwagon to read, \\"Something Borrowed,\\" and then went out and saw the movie. The movie I personally, thought was better than the book, but my friend liked the book better...sooo not sure how much merit that has. Now, I had heard that if you did not like \\"Something Borrowed,\\" that much you would prefer and like \\"Something Blue,\\" a lot better. Which I agree with---while reading...SB I felt like Rachel had no qualities that were redeeming--she was a lousy person. Period. With Darcy you cannot help, but not like her because she admits when she makes mistakes and although did change drastically throughout the book seemed to have been written more true to the character in the first book. Now certain parts of the book I felt that Ms. Griffin make very cliques, but it is what it is-- a perfect beach book. Darcy at times will make you roll your eyes because it is almost so stupid no normal adult women would do some of the things in the book she does--but you still root for her.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|I'm a very open minded man when it comes to music, yes I even tried Lady damn Gaga due to all the hype surrounding it, and well, she delivers yet again another boring generic disc full of monstrosities (no pun intended). It's becoming quite apparent that her novelty is wearing off, as even some of her most devoted fans are one starring this cd. One can't help but laugh at the cover. It's quite frankly the stupidest thing I've ever seen. She's just trying too hard now to be \\"unique\\" and \\"different\\". Sorry Lady Gaga, but it's downhill from now on. Your crappy generic I'm so different pop nonsense novelty is wearing off.<br /><br />UPDATE<br />Here's an article from yahoonews.<br /><br />Lady Gaga's Born This Way set another record this week, but not one that Gaga's team will be happy about. Sales of the album dropped off by 84% from its sizzling (but discount-inflated) opening week. That's the the steepest drop-off in sales, expressed in a percentage basis, of any of the 17 albums that sold 1 million units in a week in Nielsen SoundScan history.<br /><br />Gaga's album sold 174,000 copies this week, down from 1,108,000 last week, when sales were goosed by a two-day, 99-cent sale at Amazon.<br /><br />The old record for the steepest drop-off following a million-unit week was held by *NSYNC's 2001 album Celebrity. Sales dropped by 76% in the week following its 1,880,000 debut. Two recent albums were tied for second place in the steepest drop-off column. Sales of Lil Wayne's 2008 hit Tha Carter III and Taylor Swift's 2010 smash Speak Now both dropped off by 69% in the week following their debuts of 1,006,000 and 1,047,000, respectively.<br /><br />A big drop-off was to be expected. But the fact that Gaga's drop-off was steeper than any of the other follow-ups to albums that had a million-unit week is troublesome. It seems obvious that the opening week tally for Born This Way was generated not only by hard-core fans, but also by casual fans who just didn't want to pass up such a deal. Last week's near giveaway worked in the short term (by giving Gaga the biggest one-week sales total since 2005), but it may have also served to devalue albums in general and Gaga's brand in particular.such a deal.

B002ZG9846|4.0|This was entirely not what I thought it was going to be.  Admittedly I had barely seen any previews and just new it was about some teenager pretending to be a superhero, but I thought it would be a comedy along the lines of Scary Movie, or Napoleon Dynamite.  I was wrong.<br /><br />Dave Lizewski is your normal average geeky kid.  Until he gets the idea to become a super hero that is.  Then he becomes a little bit more.  But being a super hero isn't all its cracked up to be when the crime starts fighting him back.  And then new super heroes start appearing on the scene, all with different agendas.  Dave feels a little over his head but can't help but get drawn in.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Dave Lizewski/Kick Ass-Aaron Johnson<br />Damon Macready/Big Daddy-Nicholas  Cage<br />Mindy Macready/ Hit Girl-Chloe Moretz<br />Chris D'Amico/Red Mist-Christopher Mintz-Plasse<br />Frank D'Amico-Mark Strong<br />and others...<br /><br />Nicholas Cage has his ups and downs for me, but I actually liked him in this.  I thought he did a great job and liked the voicings and expressions he used for his character.  It added to the comedic value.  Chloe Moretz as his daughter was also very good as well.  She plays quite a controversial character (young girl killing, swearing, etc.) but made it very believable.  That being said, the main character played by Aaron Johnson didn't really do anything for me.  He was important to the film but I thought he could have been better.  As it stands, I didn't really care what happened to him.  The bad guys weren't exactly intimidating either.<br /><br />As said before I had expected this to be more comedy.  While it was to an extent, I would peg it more action/adventure/drama because it did have a lot of serious parts.  Because of all that adventure though, there is a lot of gore and murder in this movie.  Those with faint constitutions may want to think twice before watching.  There is a lot of cussing as well.  For a plot I think this one was actually pretty good.  The movie has a point when it asks why more people don't try to be real superheroes and it does a good job of pointing out why that is.  A downside though is that the pacing is rather poor and this movie, despite being an action film, kind of dragged for me and spent to much time on irrelevant details.<br /><br />Not the best of movies but not the worst either.  I'd probably rate it 3.5 stars in total.<br /><br />Review by M. Reynard 2011why more people don't try to be real superheroes and it does a good job of pointing out why that is.

B004GYNPL2|1.0|Password managers are a tricky proposition. You have to be able to integrate wth an array of third party software, implement effective encryption, and sync easily between devices, all while showing your users you can be trusted.  It's no wonder so many are proprietary software or even monthly fees.  It's a shame, then, that mSecure barely even makes an effort. It'll prefill your login forms on any browser... well, no, actually, just the stock one: no Miren, Dolphin or Firefox support here. It'll sync to your PC... if you buy additional software, which doesn't run on anything that's not Microsoft or Apple. It'll export your data for backup... in completely unencrypted form.  You have to take their word for it that they're keeping your data secure and not abusing it, because mSecure is proprietary software.   The app is free today, but even today there are many better free options whose security and interoperability are better and easily verifiable by technical users. But even a GPG-encrypted text file is a better option for me than mSecure.

B0041OOJNU|5.0|Out of the 59 albums I've bought in 2010, this is definitely the best! I got the album the day it came out and I'm finally reviewing it now. I remember when \\"Loca\\" came out on September 1st, and a lot of details of \\"Sale el Sol\\" were announced (album artwork, release date) and I was SO excited. I remember anxiously waiting for this album to come out, especially when I found out that Shakira was going \\"back to basics\\" on this one. I love this album from beginning to end.       The songs that have a \\"Pies Descalzos\\" and \\"Donde Estan los Ladrones\\" feel to them are \\"Sale el Sol\\", \\"Antes de las Seis\\", and \\"Lo Que Mas\\". The ones that have a \\"Laundry Service\\" feel are \\"Mariposas\\" and \\"Islands\\". The \\"Oral Fixation\\" ones are \\"Devocion\\", \\"Islands\\", and \\"Tu Boca\\". All the other merengue songs \\"Loca\\" (English and Spanish), \\"Gordita\\", \\"Addicted to You\\", and \\"Rabiosa\\" (English and Spanish) are new and just have a \\"Sale el Sol\\" feel to them.       The album begins eith my favorite song, \\"Sale el Sol\\". Even though I don't speak Spanish, I can tell the lyrics are amazing. It's a rock song that sounds like old-school Shakira with a new twist to it. \\"Loca\\" is also amazing, and the first single she released from the album. Both English and Spanish have great percussion and music. I also love the video. \\"Antes de las Seis\\" is my favorite right next to \\"Sale el Sol\\". I love that Chinese harp-like instrument in the song. It sounds great. I also love the acoustic-rock feel to this one. \\"Gordita\\" is the fourth track and it's amazing. It kinda sounds like a reminiscent of \\"La Tortura\\", with pounding percussion, amazing horns, and beautiful singing by Shakira.       \\"Addicted to You\\" is another merengue song from Shakira. The title is in English, but it's actually in Spanish, because the only thing she says in English is \\"I'm addicted to you.\\" Anyway, it's one of my favorites. \\"Lo Que Mas\\" is another wonderful Shakira ballad that a reminiscent of \\"Tu\\". It's only 2 1/2 minutes, but it's still a great song. \\"Mariposas\\" is another great and happy song. It kind of brings something new to the table for Shakira. I really love it. \\"Rabiosa\\" in both English and Spanish are amazing songs! It's the best merengue track on the album in my opinion! It's a very fast-paced and dancey song with a very catchy chorus. It's a memorable highlight from the album.       \\"Devocion\\" was originally meant to be on \\"She Wolf\\", but got cut, and I'm glad Shakira kept it and put it on \\"Sale el Sol\\", because it's a truly amazing song. The chorus, music, and rock sound is amazing. Shakira also does a cover of \\"Islands\\" by The xx on here. I love the original, and this cover is even better! It's one of my top 3 favorites. I love the lyrics and the alternative sounding music. \\"Tu Boca\\" is another Shakira throwback. It kind of reminds me of \\"Escondite Ingles\\" from the first \\"Oral Fixation\\" album. They both have the same grunge-ish vampiristic-alternative rock sound to it. It's a great song. The bonus tracks are the \\"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) K-Mix\\" in English and Spanish, \\"Loca\\" in English, and \\"Rabiosa\\" in English\\".        \\"Sale el Sol\\" is an amazing album, and my favorite from Shakira. Every Shakira fan should own this album!    My top 3 favorites:  1. Sale el Sol  2. Antes de las Seis  3. Islands

The extras included are not the complete set that is on the original blu-ray DVD.  Specifically the History Channel documentary is not included.  I ordered the regular blu-ray version and got the \\"essentials\\" version (sold by third party but through amazon so I got the 2 day prime shipping).  I got it quick, in one day actually.  I searched for about 30 minutes trying to see if the \\"essentials\\" version had the HC Docu on it before I opened the disc and couldn't find anything specific saying that it did NOT have it.  Wal-mart actually says it does.  Well, it doesn't.  I went ahead and opened it and verified that it doesn't have the HC docu.  I paid 13 bucks for it and I'll find someone with a blu-ray and liked the movie and just give it to them while I search a retail store locally to find the regular blu-ray version.
0451205766|5.0|Well, for me of course. My review as least: The Godfather, best story ever told. The way Puzo writes puts the reader into the world of the Corlone family. The book was just as good, if not better, than the movie. I say better, because the detail is more extreme. Defiantly a book I would take with me to prison. Easy to read at least once a year. Seriously, this was such a well written story. The characters come to life and you'll find yourself cheering for each character in the family.

1878424777|5.0|Anger, resentment, frustration: I think we've all experienced these emotions due to miscommunications and misunderstandings in our relationships.<br /><br />Two years ago, I was going through a rough spot where there was a disconnect is many of my relationships (resulting in a lot of hurt feelings on both sides). I confided in one of my best friends and he recommended this book because it helped him better communicate with others and not take their thoughts, ideas, and opinions personally, thereby distancing himself from negative emotions that would have otherwise poured over him. Even when people insulted him directly, he told me, it didn't have the same 'sting' as before.<br /><br />I've since read the book version over 20 times cover-to-cover and listened to the audio version several times. The reason for this repetition is not because I'm dense or because the information is complicated. Rather, each time I read it, I learn a little more it from both an intellectual as well as an experiential level. I can honestly say it's completely transformed several of my relationships, most notably with both my parents and some people from my past that I didn't care for at the time.<br /><br />The point is, if you're experiencing bad relationships with either yourself or others, the wisdom in the 4 agreements will help you break all these previous beliefs, assumptions, and ideas that keep your mind and heart trapped in your own illusions. I'm only part of the way down this path, but can wholeheartedly recommend this book to everyone and anyone willing to transform their lives.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|So heads up  If your christian faith in god is so weak that you cannot handle a computer generated alien making jokes and presenting logical facts regarding your faith and its almost complete lack of science.... this movie is not for you.    If you cant handle a smart ass little alien who drinks, smokes dope, and tells dirty jokes...this movie  is not for you.    If you have no humor at all and find things in a \\"comedy\\" offensive...this movie is not for you    if you find two gross British nerds taking the trip of a lifetime and doing what they love un funny or offensive...this movie is not for you    If you find large explosions or the men in black overly scary and offensive... this movie is not for you.    However,  If you enjoy crude humor, atheist overtones, large explosions, smoking dope, telling dirty jokes AND some nerdtastic adventures... this movie is for you.  I went into this flick not expecting much but I left happy and I cant wait to buy it!
B004I11VZ0|4.0|I first saw this sequel to Ip Man when it was released to the Asian market on DVD even before it hit the US theaters.  The action and plot were very good, but the translations for the English sub-titles were sometimes very bad.  However, on the Blu-ray version of Ip Man 2 they corrected all the mistakes in the sub-titles of the Asian release and the picture quality and soundtrack are on par with any US releases.      I would recommend this to people who liked the first movie, Ip Man, as this was a bit more true to his life story, though they were a lot of exaggerations as well like the scene between Donnie Yen as Ip Man and the English boxer.    Wing Chun Kuen rocks the world!
0439023513|4.0|****SPOILERS ALERT****  I loved the first two books.  I liked the third one.  I have read the other reviews and I understand a lot of the disappointments.  I don't see how the story could've been different.  Katniss is a 17 year old fighting the president of Panem.  She feels like a pawn of District 13 used by them to fulfill their plans.  I know the temptation for Collins could've been to make Katniss more of a leader than what she was.  But the reality is she was a seventeen year old girl with no war tactics experience.  She was not a soldier.  She is just a girl that have been scarred by President Snow and eventually by President Coin.  The way the war took place I think it was good.  War is not pretty and the depiction here of it makes it very clear.  I think the way the story was written was very good.  The part that I liked the most about the book was when Katniss kills President Coin.  During the whole book all she wanted to do was kill President Snow.  But after talking with him at the end she realizes that President Coin is no better than him.  In her eyes, President Coin was worse because she killed children and Katniss' sister with the purpose of ending the war once and for all.  President Snow didn't care if he died anymore.  There was no satisfaction on killing him, but killing Coin felt like getting some kind of justice for her sister.  What I didn't like from the book is that there is no relationship between the characters.  In the first two books we see how Peeta tries to protect her, sleeping right next to her, comforting her, etc.  Even if she didn't know, you could see that she was also in love with him.  I would have love to see a better description of how Peeta and Katniss lived together at the end, how they comfort each and how they loved each other.  Saying they lived together forever and had kids doesn't make any justice to their love.  Gale didn't show himself in her life.  I know he knew she loved Peeta and not him, but at least in the nameof their friendship he should have visited her.  I give this book four stars because I would have liked to see a little bit more of Peeta's and Katniss' relationship at the end of the book.

0670022411|1.0|This is a dry book with a pending suspense that is NEVER satisfied. A historian witch finds a special book that has hidden secrets that all witches, vampires and daemons want to learn. The witch falls in love with a vampire, which is forbidden by the nine member congregation of 3 vampires, 3 witches and 3 daemons. The congregation tries to stop the vampire/witch love affair on three occasions which are moderately entertaining scenes at best. The witch, who has never really used her powers, develops her powers throughout the book and eventually learns how to time travel. So with that new knowledge, she and her vampire lover travel back in time to run away. The end.    There are a few references to the 'special' book throughout the story, but you never find out its real meaning. There is no major battle - that you would expect - between the congregation and the vampire / witch lovers. It just ends with them running away.     I have no idea how this book made it to print.    Don't waste you time like I did.
B000OCZD5G|4.0|the Road Warrior on Blu-ray is great quality due to the great high-def transfer.  I won't get into the plot, because I'm sure it's been covered many times over, but to me it is a better movie than Mad Max with cuter women and some nice uncensored bare breasts!

It is nearly perfect;  better than any other line of dinosaurs I have ever known.  I am obsessed all over again,  and adding to my soon to be complete Papo dinosaur collection.  Please bring us the Brachiosaurus as the 2012 model,  and scale it properly with the Trex and Spino.  Amen
0425241505|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  It is much more than just a measly five-star in my mind.  Such great characters, just a novel idea and so many surprises!! It brought tears to my eyes in places.  Such a special story.  I am really looking forward to the next in this series.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Addictive, quick, and worth the money. Deep enough for hours of entertainment. If you enjoy tactic based games, this is a must.
B004KPLVV8|4.0|The movie is still an interesting one.  The effects, however, can be a bit hard to watch.  Jeff Bridges is wonderful but this is essentially a black and white film with hand painted effects and some of the first attempts of computer animation of any length on film.  Be prepared for some eye strain.
B000UNYK76|5.0|Este es sin dudas el mejor dvd de PJ hasta la fecha. Es una crónica de los conciertos que la banda dio en Italia al presentar su anteúltimo disco, con temas completos en vivo y con una calidad de filmación de primerísimo nivel. La calidad de imágen es superlativa, casi al mismo nivel que los bluray que tengo. Nunca pensé que un dvd se podría ver tan bien. Excelente compra.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I played the pc version but got frustrated with it and gave up.  But thus version has me hooked.  The graphics are great, gameplay works great, it's funny and each level is the right length to kill time while waiting in line or something.  Got it when it was the free app but it's definitely worth $1.50!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I love this book, once I started reading I couldnt put it down. I was looking for ways to sneak and read it at work and home! I cant wait to read more from Jamie McGuire because this book is perfect! I agree with the other review that says they wish there was more books like this! I do to!
0439023513|5.0|After finishing a book, I always like to go see the reviews of it. Reviews don't make much sense beforehand until you read the book. Let me just say this about all the negative reviews of this book...    They absolutely shocked me.    In my opinion a good book, or a book series for that matter, prevents you from putting it down. When you finish one book, you MUST read the next one immediately or your mind just races. And when your done, its leaves with a feeling  of longing and elation - you want more.    With these books, I read them all in 4 days, the last two in a day each... I couldn't put them down, and when I was done, I had to reflect on them, as I still am.    Every negative review appears to revolve around missed expectations, people expected one thing to happen, the book to end a certain way, or the character arcs to proceed in a certain typical manner.    I don't consider predictable plots enjoyable, nor do I create expectations before I read a book. All I know is that I could not put this book down, every moment was riveting, the plot twists were unpredictable, and my mind never stopped racing.    The key point -  I enjoyed this book as a whole, so It gets 5 stars. If I spend the money, I should enjoy it right? I Highly recommend this book.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I started playing this and figured it would be fun for a few levels but I was so wrong... In my spare time I have been playing this slowly progressing one to two levels at a time.<br /><br />The plants are interesting, effective, and entertaining; the zombies are sad, annoying and fun to kill.  The variety between just simple defense, bowling, and whack-a-mole levels are a welcomed change of pace.  The game slowly draws you in at a comfortable pace with new plants, new zombies, added features and abilities.  I'm looking forward to finishing this game and a sequel (if one is created).
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I enjoyed the book and would have liked to be able to read chapter 12.   That's not possible on my Kindle because of the layout.   Things like this need to be considered before a book is deemed suitable for a Kindle.
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|Katy's success with her earlier songs was what brought her to the limelight, yet, prior to this release, it could still be questioned whether she would achieve stability in the realm of pop superstars. This CD cements her place as such. On the whole, it is the story of youth, love, and the temptations that come along as a result of the interplay of these factors. From Teenage Dream to California Girls, the CD sets forward ideas of youthful perfection. In my personal favorite, Last Friday Night, the teenage party scene is glorified, true, in certain respects, but covertly Katy also highlights the repercussions of such action. Finally, Katy's voice is proven to be magical in certain respects, as this album finally showcases what we have been lacking and failing to notice: that Katy is a really good singer as well as entertainer.
B004WMKSH2|3.0|Since \\"...Goblet of Fire\\", the Harry Potter novels and movies have been on a slow steady slide from being charming original young adult fantasies to becoming pedestrian adult fantasies of the lowest order. This is the penultimate completion of that slide, with enough of the good stuff stripped out of the novel so as to render it almost faceless and meaningless. One of the themes of the last novel is that Harry has been ultimately betrayed and abandoned by all of the adults in his life - including Dumbledore, who was so busy acting so mysterious and wizardly that he did not tell Harry what he needed to know in order to survive. There is no trace of Harry Potter's inner conflict in this movie. All that leaves you with is a bunch of guys throwing power bolts out of magic wands. For that you can watch the X-Men.

B004I8WD7S|4.0|You could say I have an obsession with iPhone cases. I just can't seem to find the *perfect* case. They're always either too big and bulky, or they're so thin they don't really provide any protection, or they leave marks on the phone. I have tried no fewer than a dozen cases for just my iPhone 4, and the AmazonBasics case is in the top 3.<br /><br />It's not the best looking case I've ever seen, but it's not ugly by any means. I think it could be a LITTLE thinner, but the thickness gives your iphone a lot of protection should you drop it. And if you're as accident-prone as I am, you probably need that much protection anyways.<br /><br />I really like the material the case is made out of... it's a rubbery material but it's not very stretchy. I haven't had the case for very long, but it doesn't seem like it will stretch much like some rubbery cases that end up too big for the phone after a few weeks/months.<br /><br />It also has ample room in the headphone and dock connector areas so you don't have to take the case off, even for standard headphones or a third-party (oversize) dock connector.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with the design and quality of the case. It's been on my iPhone since receiving the package from Amazon, despite all the other cases in my desk drawer.
0345528581|5.0|You are your own gym<br /><br />Mark does a fantastic job building a solid foundation for developing a workout regime. He covers nutrition, aerobic exercises (and why bodyweight exercises are better for losing weight), and offers multiple exercises that vary as much in difficulty as which muscles receive a workout. His website seems like a shameless plug, but actually does offer itself to be a helpful complement to this book. The exercises are simple, and Mark recommends you develop it ala carte based on your abilities and needs. It's not a fad or diet, but instead is a good way to shape up your muscles and build up strength.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars
B004SIP71M|4.0|I walked in to see Doubt expecting a thriller/drama in line with the star-studded cast. They did not disappoint. Streep's performance is excellent, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman brings a haunting cast to the priest accused of child molestation and inappropriate behavior. Amy Adams, on the sideline, plays the role of innocence-lost while Hoffman and Streep struggle for power in the community, with Streep denouncing Hoffman, attempting to remove him from the pulpit in order to protect her students as the sister in charge of the Catholic school. Definitely watch this film, but be prepared for an emotional roller coaster. This does an excellent job, among other things, at interjecting the self-doubt that is present in even the strongest of characters.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The three books for this series is among the best crime/drama novels that I have ever read. I simply could not put down my Kindle. All too sad that the author died before his time - we could have had a really nice run to compare to the likes of Patterson or Balducci.

143911000X|4.0|This book is what it seems like. Namely, its the Gospel of Barney Stinson in paperback form. The Bro Code draws not only upon some aspects of the show but also creates new codes unseen in the show. This is for die-hard fans and will give you a couple of laughs, mainly due to the commentary and pictoral representations found at the bottoms of some of the pages.    Warnings:  -Sarcastic, male-centered humor  -Womanizing orientation (as with the character)  -Sexual references    On the whole, this book is a quick joy. It's short and will take you no time at all to go through, however remember that it is intended solely to be humor. The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because some of the Bro Code numbers are different on the show than they are in the book. On the whole, not a big flaw.

B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is a new type of comedy. A lot of the jokes revolve around the intelligence of the characters, but in this lies the appeal of the series. Sheldon and Leonard are physicists who live together, often visited by their fellow nerd-migos Raj and Howard in their safe little social circle. When the beautiful, socially popular blonde, Penny, moves in across the hall, however, Leonard instantly becomes smitten. The Big Bang Theory chronicles the relationship of these characters, with each having special signature traits that are sure to make you laugh until you cry!    Sheldon: his special spot, special diet, themed nights, extreme literal nature, anecdotes  Leonard: down-to-earth nerdiness, fondness for Penny, failed relationship attempts  Raj: Inability to speak with women unless drunk  Howard: Jewish nonconformity, living with his mother, sexual nature
B004GYNPL2|4.0|First off I wish I could have bought this for nothing, but I purchased it off the marketplace a few days ago. Personally, I think it is one of the better password apps out there. I can use my own keyboards and create custom cards if needed.  Now to cover some of these complaints. First off, you don't have to pay again, unless you WANT to. I am considering getting the desktop client, but I don't really need it. Secondly, those who say Keeper is free are wrong. It states quite clearly that it is $15 after the first month.   So, overall, I think this is a great app even at $5. My only complaint is that I couldn't get it for free.
0307477479|4.0|I thought the book was entertaining and engaging.  Each chapter focuses on a character that has appeared somewhere previously in the story ( except for the first chapter of course).  Characters were usually only tangentially connected but Egan does a great job of telling their story and I found that I cared and was interested in each character presented.  It was almost like reading a collection of short stories.  I think winning the Pulitzer will certainly elevate the expectations of this book and that's a shame because it was a good read when I had no expectations.  Traveling through time with the music industry as a backdrop was interesting, although the themes of growing up and losing one's youthful optimism are universal.  The end of the book, which is set in the future, was a little strange, with a lot of emphasis on the digital culture.  I didn't find that nearly as interesting as the character portraits earlier in the book, but perhaps it was because I couldn't relate to the futuristic vision that Egan imagines.     Go ahead and read it but keep your expectations in check.  I enjoyed it.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|This CD will grow on you with each listen! Next week I would probably rate it 6 STARS if i could. Secret Love and Italian Summer stood out immediately on first listen. Then For What It's Worth and the title track grab your attention. With each listen, you discover something you never noticed before. Ghosts Are Gone really rocks hard. There's really something for everybody on this CD. I just wish it hadn't taken 10 years to wait for new Stevie music!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Sheldon, Leonard, Raj, Howard, and Penny are a bundle of quirkiness. You never, throughout the entirety of this season, know what to expect, as all the characters continue to defy all logic set forth for them throughout the course of the other two season. However, the characters remain entrenched in their same basic patterns of behavior while retaining the possibility for personal, humorous, growth.Sheldon is the mad scientist of the group. Leonard is known to remark that Sheldon Cooper \\"is one lab experiment away from being a supervillain.\\" Set in his ways, Sheldon is the most set in his ways, the most awkward, yet the most lovable of all the characters. Leonard is, too, a nerd, but a more social one. He is the character with whom it is easy to relate, and he is more....normal than Sheldon in this respect. A key plotline of this season is Leonard's relationship with Penny, with whom he has been trying to cultivate mutual feelings since she moved in across the hall. Penny, however, is the stereotypical blonde beauty, who, having moved to California to become an actress, now works at the Cheesecake Factory. Penny develops over the course of the series, having reached her intellectual prime at this point in time as a result of constant access to the lovable nerds. Needless to say, their relationship makes for interesting humor, not to mention after adding in the constant presence of Sheldon as Leonard's roommate.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is typical Jillian - gasping for mercy - sweating buckets. It's a little more intense than No More Trouble Zones, but the workout is shorter. When I have the time, I've actually started doing the level 2 and level 3 workouts back to back (minus the level 3 warm up). When I'm done, I feel like I really got a fantastic workout in. At the same time, I really like that the workouts are short for days that I just don't have time to do a 50 minute workout. The only negative I feel is in level 3, she moves straight into cardio from a \\"strength\\" circuit that already has my heart through the roof. Nothing says Jillian like feeling my heart about to beat out of my throat and then hearing the words \\"Okay... Let's go into our cardio...\\" Ugh... Please!!!! It's actually getting easier, though, and I guess I can't complain about a workout being too hard.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Just watched this on Netflix and boy was it awesome!  I haven't seen a movie this much fun in a long long time.  The action scenes are incredible and the cast really does a great job.  I can't get over how awesome Hit Girl was in this movie.  She was really good as a vampire in \\"Let Me In\\", which I saw before this (highly recommend that movie by the way).  But she is absolutely awesome in this.  This is definitly a movie that I will be watching again for years to come.  I hope the sequel can live up to the bar that was set with this one.  If you are unsure about watching this movie...don't be.  It's a roller coaster fun ride!

0425242099|1.0|I have waited for Hawke and Sienna's story since the beginning.  Gah!!! - what a disappointment.  The author spends WAY too much time padding her story with other couples.  When you do get rare Hawke/Sienna moments, they are repetitive and redundant (\\"I can't mate bond with you.\\" \\"I know.\\" and on and on these two circle around the same conversation. BORING!).  Because there weren't enough meaningful interactions between them, their chemistry was lacking and subsequently, when they do finally get together, it is such a let-down...ZERO heat...you just don't care by that point.    At $15 a pop...not worth it.  Rent it from the library or borrow it from someone instead if you must continue this convoluted series.
B001CISHU4|5.0|If you like Amon Amarth, this CD will not disappoint you. I also highly recommend their newest CD: Sutar Rising. The talent this band has reached after playing together for two decades, is what many metal bands aim for, but few achieve. The vocals do not range a great deal stylistically but are very solidly brutal: just as a viking warriors would be expected to sound. So it fits the theme of the music (battles and Norse mythology). Quite frankly I prefer a tougher vocalist anyways as some of the eighties squealers and raspy black metal whine-o vocals aren't quite brutal enough for me. I like a solid manly roar, that could just be my preferance as a female for hypermasculity, so sue me.   Any band that plays for three hours live with no opening acts and can headbang in unison while playing such technically complicated music without falling over or messing up has my vote. Wow! There is a definate formula to their music that is repeated throughout their albums, but the skill and complexity is at such a level that it is still quite wonderful. Amon Amarth are probably my favorite present-day metal band. I only skip a couple of the tracks when listening to Twilight of the Thunder Gods, but it isn't because they aren't all good songs, it's because the ones that I like are so very good, I must listen to them again right away.
B004RKXN44|5.0|Singh is truly amazing with this series. The other reviews give an excellent review of the plot, so I wont rehash that. What I worried about was  the romance between Hawke and Sienna- it has been building over so many books that I was afraid that their actual love story wouldn't live up to the hype, as it were.  This  is a great love story! Singh gives Hawke a woman worthy of him. This book was also a \\"twofer\\", with a second love story involving Walker and Lara. I liked him before- I love him now. I would have enjoyed a longer book on them. All our favorite SnowDancers and DarkRiver cats show up and the war/tensions  with the Pure Psy cranks up even more (is that even possible, you ask? Yes!!!)  Battles, true love, sacrifice, loyalty,family,lasting friendship- it's all here and it's a fantastic ride. The best part? I have no idea who's story is next and where Ms. Singh will go from here, which means she can take us anywhere. I can't wait!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I was enjoying this game until it erased all of my progress.  The game also lags occasionally and takes up a huge amount of ram and storage for such a simple game.  I'll wait until an update is released before playing again.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|yaya heres another app that wont install on my phone ,well i quess i missed out on this one. .
B001UV4XHY|2.0|My husband and I thought this was very boring, compared to the other video's. Obviously a very good PR campaign. Now we have to buy the Part 2 so we can see what happens, hopefully it won't be as boring. Sad to end the series this way.
1439148953|5.0|I almost love this book.  It is extremely evocative of a book that I truly love, \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\" by Betty Smith.  \\"Brooklyn\\" is almost a view of Irish immigrants in Brooklyn, 50 years later.   In both books, the characters are clearly painted against palpable settings in New York.  It would be interesting to know if Toibin was influenced by Smith at all.    The author's approach to telling the story is to present one beautiful tableau after another.  Indeed, there is very little plot to draw the reader forward, but Toibin always ensured that I wanted to view the next scene, with little regard to a story line.  In my opinion, this is the best kind of good literature.  The words themselves are the thing of value and beauty.   It actually took me a couple chapters to realize that the details that he used are there to make the characters and scenes more real, not necessarily to foretell complication or conflict.   I adored that touch.     One issue that I have is that Toibin does not fully get inside a girl's mind when he describes Eilis' sexual experiences with Tony.   Additionally, I would have liked it if the story ended in Brooklyn when she returned from visiting her family in Ireland.  Perhaps, my need for closure is a result of watching too many Hollywood movie endings, but I think that there would have been some literary value in showing the success, or failure, of her return to her new home.    In any case, this novel has stuck in my head for many days after completion, in a way that only \\"the really good stuff\\" does.  It has been quite a reading pleasure.      This is HIGHLY recommended.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The gameplay is very faithful to the PC version, and is smooth and good up to around level 1-6. The two times I was actually able to exit the game my phone rebooted, otherwise the game would hang, the screen would freeze or stop recognizing input, then go black eventually with music playing until I forced a reboot by holding the power button. At the later stages of level 1-8 with many plants active, the game stuttered frequently, then hung after I finished the level & returned to the main screen. I have not yet tried in flight mode to see if that makes a difference.
B004INNRFK|5.0|oh my God. this is the best music video ever.  amazing. holy smackaroni. im tellin you. buy this. its awesome great beyond belief. im not kidding. i watched it 3 times and and am having friends over to watch again. cant wait to watch their reaction. too many great parts to mention. . just amazed. ace
B0052UZIFA|1.0|this wont even install on phone. i am connected to my wifi and i have a ton of free space but still will not install. never going to use amazon app again till this is fixed.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|there goes my productivity... have been running down my battery every night playing this. after trying a very short demo on XBOX that gives just the tiniest flavour of this game, it's been infinitely rewarding strategically selecting and learning to utilize the different types of plants to kill off wave after wave of zombies. not a mindless game but not so challenging that it's discouraging.
0596805527|5.0|/***** Google Translator *****/    The title definitely does justice to the contents of the book, could be called even JavaScript Bible. I have to say that javascript is the language that I dislike, but also gives me many times, the impression that we never make an effort to know it inside. Let's what we need at the moment and if something goes wrong we blame him or the implementation js in the browser (which normally is also guilty of many headaches).    The book is well explained and organized, with topics ranging from easiest to hardest, being the first basic chapters to understand the following. But the box is not there. The good thing about this book is the amount of information that provides details of syntax, language behavior, tricks ... really amazing.    I think it is suitable for a beginner in javascript, because such information does not clearly see where you go. But that takes time working with js, is a reference book you can not miss and that will help us understand the reason for the failure of that script.    Español -->      Definitivamente el título hace justicia al contenido del libro, podría llamarse incluso La Biblia de JavaScript. Tengo que decir que javascript es de los lenguajes que menos me gusta, pero también me da la impresión, de que nunca hacemos un esfuerzo para conocerlo a fondo. Vamos a lo que necesitamos en el momento y si algo falla le echamos la culpa a js o a la implementación en el navegador (que normalmente también es culpable de muchos dolores de cabeza).    El libro, está muy bien explicado y organizado, con temas que van de menor a mayor dificultad, siendo los primeros capítulos básicos para poder entender los siguientes. Pero su fuerte no está ahí. Lo bueno de este libro es la cantidad de información que proporciona, detalles de sintaxis, comportamiento del lenguaje, trucos... realmente algo asombroso.    Creo que no es indicado para un principiante en javascript, porque tanta información hace que no veas claramente a donde vas. Pero para el que lleva un tiempo trabajando con js, es un libro de referencia que no puede faltar y que nos ayudará a entender el porqué del fallo de aquel script.
B0045EJY90|5.0|It play CDs faultlessly but what I find particularly impressive is the the USB input feature. By using a Maxtor external harddrive reformatted to FAT 32 I was able to copy a tremendous number of songs in MP3 format.  The music titles are clearly displayed on the Teac. If I had one suggestion for improvement it would be to put a second USB input on the rear of the device so that my USB cord would not be visible. Of course putting the USB in the front makes plugging in thumb drives more convenient. I really like this CD player.
B0043RSE2M|4.0|I won't bore anyone by rehashing the story line and instead review the actual 3D product.  Great product.  They threw several opportunities to really show off the 3D by having images float off the screen or point out at you.  The rest of the time the 3D is really just for adding depth to the scenes which is not a bad thing at all.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I've been playing for 2 days and got to roof levels. I wasn't having any issues with quitting the game. This last time I started it back up everything except my name is gone: levels, money, even achievements. Restarting game and phone has no effect. Very frustrating. Samsung vibrant.
B004V6MWFU|1.0|The songs seem good, and I'm a big uke fan, but Eddie can't play it very well, and the skull pounding repetitive strumming hurts the tunes more than they help. One of the most ill-conceived albums I've ever listened to. His closing cover of \\"Dream A Little Dream\\" is just pure skin-crawling creepy.
B001JNNDEW|4.0|Dry, wry and funny - saw it on its first release, when it was largely overlooked by the public. Good commentary on the corporate culture, in the same satirical league and philosophical bent as Dilbert. Livingstone and Cole are very good, Anniston is not given much to do, and Stephen Root's performance is legendary. I worked once for a multi-national entity, and this film really gets it right! Four stars from me.
B000WLLAF6|5.0|Asia's second album continued the style and sound of their first.  Provided you like their first album you will enjoy this as well.  Alpha was Asia's last strong release that featured their strong, in your face, brand of progressive arena rock.  The songs are catchy and the musical talent of all involved is something that needs to be heard to fully appreciate.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My wife loved this game on our PS3 so i paid the buck 50 on my droid 2. Game runs flawlessly. Even funner with the touch screen than a controller. Best game Ive ever played on a phone. (even better than angry birds.) All youre really missing from the PC and console game is no zen garden. Only complaint is that it decimates my phones battery, but thats more a phone issue than the game. 5 stars easy.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I read this as a fan fiction from the first word to the last letter....this my  friends is not Twilight this is an adult very sexy erotic story of two people to fall in love and lust ...not some teenage romance and so not for the faint at heart..and if she make a profit from this ,which i hope she does she has worked hard and put her heart here<br />I think its one of the best written books I have ever read...... dying for the release of parts 2 and 3
B003NRWW58|1.0|Unless you are a fan of the stereotypical BBC Sci-fi drama, this isn't for you.  I saw the cover, read the description, and figured I would give it a watch.  It was painfully bad, lots of overly dramatic acting in emotional situations.  Characters were either completely emotional or completely unemotional from scene to scene.  The exception is that the Captain was more well acted.  Camera work is certainly sub-par, though it is comparable to others of the BBC in picture quality it is not in handling.  Somehow I watched episode 12 rather than the 1st but I think this gave me the best idea of how bad it could be.  While this is not going to matter to everyone the main character, the Captain, is gay and you will at least watch men kissing.  I know that doesn't matter to everyone but if it does bother you there is the heads up.  Overall I think the show is a overly dramatic version of Doctor Who
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I absolutely love this game. sure its a bit slower than its pc/dsi/xbox counterparts but thats to be expected on a PHONE. I missed the free day to download but gladly payed the 1.49 for it. only thing im not too fond of is the quick play options. i wish it had stages of vasebreaker like the pc or baseball like the ds. either way still awesome. Ive been waiting months for this game and it was well worth it.
B003TML0VO|2.0|Mr. Sanata (aka Santana), has finally gotten on my nerves.   I hope you read this you old fool!  They used to call you guitar god, now you're just a pauper for the studio machinery.  Para boludo!
B004GYNPL2|1.0|Don't waste your time with this. There are better password managers out there that don't require you buy a version for your desktop.  LastPass is a great one.  I use Keepass with dropbox to get my passwords synced between my phone and 4 computers.  Even free, this app costs too much.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for this to come to android FOREVER!!! So happy I got it for free, but would have paid for it.
B000001ZS3|5.0|remember having the lp of this one - it was so good you could hear the sound travel from one speaker to the other - still a great sound
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This game has become my new obsession. However 40% of the time when I open the game it reboots my phone. Please fix. (Samsung Fascinate)
B004GYY714|5.0|I moved to a different state recently and really missed my favorite radio station. No other app has let me stream so flawlessly.  Just what I was looking for.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This and angry birds are the only two games I've ever looked forward to playing on my phone (evo 4g). all other games just pass time, this is actually fun and we'll made. they did a great job of keeping form being repetitive as well. every time you beat a level you unlock something new.   This game is great and I would highly recommend it.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This headset is amazing!! Since the moment I tried them on, I loved them. The tiniest sounds can be heard clearly. For example, I was playing a game of Black Ops yesterday (the day I got them), and I saw a guy on the radar, and I knew he was camping. So I decided to test the PX21's. I stood there waiting for a while, then I hear the sound of a knife hitting metal all the way from downstairs! It turns out he was bored so he was knifing a computer. I ran upstairs at the perfect time and killed him.   Also, the basses are deep and clear. My only problem is the static. It's very tiny though and is drowned out by normal gameplay. If you have that too when you get it, don't worry, you will soon forget it's there.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I thought the point of a kindle was so you didn't have to print paper. How can the price of sending something wirelessly possibly be double that of the paper version which had to be printed? I don't like killing trees. The publishers are making a mistake charging this amount.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I'd stay away from keepass for that reason alone.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game! Worth every penny.... Got it free on launch day! Got it on Xbox 360 as well.DROID X Bottom line it's a buy!!!
0316069353|4.0|Why is it that mediocre books sell so well? Take a look at the top of the bestseller charts, and you'll likely see inferior novels such as [[ASIN:1565125606 Water from Elephants]] or [[ASIN:030726999X The Girl Who Knocked Over the Outhouse]] or any of Dan Brown's novels before da Da Vinci Code. Who reads such offal?<br /><br />My guess is that these novels are snatched up by people who, in general, don't read many books. They don't really know what's out there, so they wait until they hear about some popular new book and buy that. Having been forced to read dull books in school, they expect a book to be a rough slog, and they read with little enthusiasm. That's precisely why the public libraries allow a book to be loaned for a month at a time. (One month? Who'd take a month to read a good book? Seems to me that you'd forget what had happened at the book's beginning by the time you finished it!) The abovementioned novels may sell, but I suspect they're bought by people who will read only that book for the entire year.<br /><br />On the other hand, there's the Constant Reader (ref. to Ms. Parker), the person who genuinely loves books, and who would rather read than watch TV or a movie, who can't get enough books, who has typically read a favorite book five-or-six times over. Such book lovers have no patience for inferior books, and they inevitably discover the work of Michael Connelly and devour not just one, but all of his books.<br /><br />Allow me to demonstrate: EVERYONE READING THIS WHO HAS READ EVERY ONE OF MICHAEL CONNELLY'S NOVELS RAISE YOUR HAND NOW.<br />See? That's proof of Michael Connelly's greatness, and there are reasons for his popularity among avid readers.<br /><br />(a.) One is that Connelly's skills as a writer are unsurpassed. There are never any awkward sentences or bad syntax, and I have yet to spot so much as a split infinitive in his writing. The man knows his craft.<br /><br />(b.) Also flawless is the pacing of Connelly's stories. The plot moves along, never failing to maintain momentum. There are no dull passages, and there's never the temptation to skip a page or even a paragraph. Detroit's Elmo Leonard famously published [[ASIN:0061451460 10 Rules for Writers,]] and in it, he advises authors, \\"Try to leave out the part that readers tend to skip.\\" That's never a problem in the books of Michael Connelly.<br /><br />(c.) Speaking of the Dutchman, Leonard and Connelly are the best at writing realistic dialogue. ([[ASIN:0393318680 Irvine Welsh]] is the best at writing unintelligible Scots argot.) They have a musician's ear for the cadence of how people actually speak. When they write street talk -- Ebonics, patois-- they never lay it on too thick. That's a problem with most other writers of both popular fiction and literature: most dialogue makes the reader wince, because you know that no one has ever spoken such words, nor is it conceivable that dialogue like that will ever be spoken by anyone.<br /><br />(d.) Most important to me is the fact that Connelly gets all the details right. In the recent [[ASIN:0312428227 Lush Life]], Richard Price has his detectives perform a paraffin test to see if a suspect has fired a gun. That test hasn't been used for many years. The author didn't do his homework. Detectives now carry field test kits, and thanx to researcher Dennis Wojciechowski, Michael Connelly stays abreast of the latest in forensic technology. Nor does he put safety levers or silencers on revolvers. There are no \\"groaners\\" in his novels.<br /><br />(e.) Related to this is that Michael Connelly is steadily improving as a writer, because his novels have become more and more realistic. Whatever their talent as story tellers, such popular authors as Dan Brown or James Ellroy or Jo Nesbø (a Michael Connelly imitator from Norway whose anti-hero detective is named \\"Harry Hole\\"), do not write very realistic novels, nor, typically, do most authors in the Techno Thriller genre. They're o.k., I guess, but really, if you're over 18, you're too old to be reading such nonsense.<br /><br />Now, as to The Fifth Witness: as a novel by Michael Connelly, it rates only about two stars (more on this later), but when compared to 90% of the general dreck that's being published these days, it's far superior. BUT . . .<br /><br /> HALT ! >&lt; &iexcl; SPOILER ALERT ! ¥ &iexcl; SPOILER ALERT ! >&lt; STOP !<br /><br />If, unlike the rest of us, you have not read all four of the Mickey Haller novels, please don't read any further. I have nothing clever to say, and continuing on will spoil the books for you at no gain.<br /><br />Although The Fifth Witness is not a poor book, and it's certainly a great improvement over [[ASIN:0446556750 The Reversal]], it seems to me that Connelly has dug himself into a rut in the Mickey Haller series. In each novel, Haller is saddled with a client whom he does not like, and gradually it is revealed that the client is, in fact, guilty, though Haller still must defend him (or her). Once the client is revealed to be guilty, the plot contains no further surprises, there is no suspense, and things are resolved with some tacked-on violence at the end when the bad guy (or gal) gets what's coming to him (her).<br /><br />That worked well in the best of the series, the first one, [[ASIN:1455500232 The Lincoln Lawyer]], but since then, Connelly's been basically writing the same book over and over. The Fifth Witness ends with Haller deciding to become a prosecutor, but that may make things worse, because the Mickey Haller character was interesting only when he was a pettifogger who bent the rules (as does his half-brother) when it suited his purpose. The Reversal is the worst of all Connelly's novels, because in it, Haller is too bland of a character, too squeaky clean. I worry that another novel with Haller as prosecutor will again spend pages on jury selection (thus violating point (b.) above).<br /><br />As much as I like Bosch and Haller as protagonists, it may be time for Michael Connelly to stop mechanically cranking out the same product every nine months. Perhaps he should write a novel of Harry Bosch during the time he spent in the [[ASIN:B000K0CWGK The Tunnels of Cu Chi]]. What about a historical novel? Old man Haller in the corrupt LA of the 1940s?<br /><br />I'm particularly fond of the [[ASIN:0060751398 Judge Dee Mysteries]], written by Robert van Gulik, and based on ancient Chinese detective stories. But van Gulik died in 1967, and surely more such marvelous tales should be written. Someone should send Connelly a [[ASIN:0226848655 Judge Dee mystery)]] to show him what can be done with stories set in a completely different era.<br /><br />Anything but another book like this or the last one.y, if you're over 18, you're too old to be reading such nonsense.<br /><br />Now, as to The Fifth Witness: as a novel by Michael Connelly, it rates only about two stars (more on this later), but when compared to 90% of the general dreck that's being published these days, it's far superior.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Game works wonderfully on my HTC EVO Shift with Sprint.  No lag in gameplay or video at all.  Near perfect Android port in my opinion.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Starts out very easy, but gets harder each level .  I had this on my computer first and now my Epic.  I really love this game and play it whenever waiting for anything/anyone.
140003180X|4.0|This is my 4th Alexander McCall Smith book in this series.  I still love them and have ordered more.<br />That said, I must warn readers who are new to this series: this is not a \\"detective\\" series like Conan Doyle or C.S.I or any other modern detective series with evidence and dangerous culprits.<br />No it is an interesting African woman who solves her assignments by listening to her clients with a good grasp of basic psychology and has fascinating ways of solving her puzzles. The puzzles or no more threatening than finding out what a husband is up to or locating a couple of people who someone needs to talk to.<br />This particular novel explores the development of a side business for the agency asst. detective and a quick romance for her. The development of this character started in the previous novel and I expect it will continue. Also included are some small problems with her two adopted children.<br />My only criticism of these novels is that they have long lectures on how people should behavior. There is a lot of comparison of the old Botswana ways of politeness vs modern day behavior. Both Precious - the main character and her assistant spend time reflecting on what people should do vs. what they actually do. It can get a bit tiresome sometimes.<br />Nevertheless, I am enchanted by the descriptions of the land, the views of the cattle (which were a type of currency), and the various tribal stereotypes and the challenges presented.<br />The books are fast reads and fun. I recommend them for a fun and different reading experience.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|Required purchase of the desktop version if you want your passwords on anything but your android.  Also, exports to plaintext? You've got to be kidding me! I'll stick with keepass and dropbox, thanks.

B004NJW976|5.0|This is a must have for any lover of Moby (like myself). Any person giving a lukewarm review to this compilation simply DOES NOT GET MOBY !  Moby is an artist, not a mainstream top 40 type singer/songwriter.  His music always sweeps me into an emotional trance of sorts, he takes me on a journey every time. And regardless of whether or not I recognize my surroundings, I always feel lucky and privilaged to be invited along.     This may well end up being my favorite, and I have every one of his CD's. Like the title of my review states----hypnotically BRILLIANT !    ****a sidenote to anyone training for a marathon or any long race---his music is PERFECT for LSD's!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Garbage porting job. Won't even start most of the time without silently quitting to the launcher. If it does actually start, it locks up and crashes within minutes without fail. Plenty of other bugs, but hardly worth mentioning.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|X-Men: First Class is the best X-Men movie to date and probably my favorite comic book film since The Dark Knight. This is basically another origin story (set in 1962) like the one about Wolverine a couple of years ago, but unlike that one, First Class gets nearly everything right. The story has a lot to do with the Cuban Missile Crisis, so it works on a historic, as well as, a pure action and entertainment level.<br /><br />What really makes it tick though is the outstanding cast. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender are equally great in the roles of the younger Professor X and Magneto. They really hold the film together with their presence and excellent line delivery. Jennifer Lawrence, fresh off a Oscar nomination for Winter's Bone, does a good job with Mystique. Knowing that Kevin Bacon was playing the villain had me worried going in, but he pulled it off. The rest of the cast could have used a little more development, but seeing the dude who is a red version of Nightcrawler doing his teleportation thing is always neat. The pre-Beast guy is a whiny baby, so I couldn't wait for him to turn into the blue fur ball. I also must mention two very nice cameos from characters from the other X-Men movies. One in particular had my whole theater (which by the way was almost entirely full) laughing.<br /><br />The writing is pretty smart for the most part, full of good one on one conversations between McAvoy and Fassbender, while still leaving enough room for some well thought out jokes. A few scenes really stand out and are memorable. One being at a bar where Magneto goes lethal, accompanied by a superb use of music that amps up the suspense.<br /><br />My only problem is with the CGI. Some of it looked amazing, but at other times it looked blurry or not as polished as one would expect. Maybe I have just been spoiled with IMAX clarity, so I'll have to wait for the Blu-ray to see if it was just my theater's presentation. They also took a risk by opening with the exact same scene as the first film and having more subtitles than some kids sitting around me cared for.<br /><br />I can't recommend this highly enough. It's worth the high gas and the ticket prices to see it on the big screen. I really hope they make another with this director and cast.and having more subtitles than some kids sitting around me cared for.    I can't recommend this highly enough.

0061564893|4.0|Interesting read. The author has literally hundreds of literature reviews. Also, contacts and conversations he had are documented and explained in a practical way. This is the type of common sense approach to history that opens new doors to the way our society has evolved. Many thanks to the author for his no-nonsense approach.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is what you expect from Baldacci.  This thriller kept you interested until the end.  It was hard to put down.
0679805273|5.0|I bought this book after my son made a wonderful suggestion for his pre-school daughter.  He plans to give it to each of her teachers at the end of each school year and ask them to write something for his daughter.  When she graduates from high school he will make it a graduation gift.  It will be wonderful to read what her teachers have said about her throughout her years in education.
0321701763|5.0|I will be using this book as the textbook for a class I am teaching in the fall for Digital Art.  I already used the similar CS3 book last semester, and this one looks to be mostly updated with new art projects.  It fits my needs to a T.
0375414053|2.0|As a career woman and mother married to an Architect/Construction Manager in a weak economy, I could strongly identify with Kate's struggles.  Thus, I can understand why this book is loved by many.  However, her management of the situation throughout the novel and her decision towards the end of it were, in my opinion, more of a disservice than a positive motivator to other women living this reality.  Granted she works in the financial industry, which is known to be one of the harshest for working mothers, but the message should be that we need to find the middle ground that works for each family- not cave into one of the black and white choices she presents.  It is definitely not easy, but there are ways to find a better balance and to put your foot down in the work place (particularly if you are demonstrating results such as Kate is).  Also, as many working mothers will tell you, a significant priority rearrangement needs to take place to maintain a healthy level of sanity.  Sadly, however, the author's solution to the problem is telling our daughters that there is no hope for them as future moms/working professionals because generations before them tried and failed.  Finally, I do not understand why Kate does not demand more from her husband if he so wants her to make a change in her career! Yes, he is kind and helpful with the kids.  But, why doesn't he try to seek a higher paying job, or alternative source of income with his free time so that she can feel more comfortable with not taking on the extra hours and projects?  For the first time, I am hoping the Hollywood version of a story will take a different route than that of the author's.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Best game out there!  addicted to this from the iPhone days but now this makes my Evo complete.    It's a huge 75MB download and is by far the largest program I've downloaded

B003YFJ5U4|5.0|I would encourage anyone interested in this subject to read this book.  That said, it's important to understand what this book covers and at what level; coming to this book with a background in physics, and having read other books on the interpretation of quantum mechanics, I didn't find any further insights into the subject here.  The book is generally well-written, albeit with some purple prose here and there that I found a bit annoying.  It is most appropriate for a reader with a non-technical background who's willing to stretch; to anyone who's taken a course in elementary modern physics, all of the mathematical content will be very familiar.  The summary historical lead-up to the main subject is masterful - there are a lot of people, places, developments and concepts to introduce, and the author does the best job of this that I've ever encountered.  What I found unique was the chronology of the arguments, liberally illustrated with direct quotes from the participants - while I've read a number of meatier books on the subject, none provided the historical perspective here, which leads to an appreciation of the depth of thought over decades that's led to our current (lack of) understanding.<br /><br />For those who have finished this book and are looking for more, a couple of suggestions: [[ASIN:1400079969 Uncertainty: Einstein, Heisenberg, Bohr, and the Struggle for the Soul of Science]], which addresses the same subject in a different way - more from the perspective of the ideas than the chronology - and which I would say that I found to be more compelling; [[ASIN:0198525362 Beyond Measure: Modern Physics, Philosophy, and the Meaning of Quantum Theory]], which is much meatier and satisfying in addressing the meaning of quantum theory, but which requires one to go further with the concepts/mathematics.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|much easier to play than the xbox 360 version but still fun...one bad thing is that it has to reload everytime the screen cuts off, which is really annoying when you're deciding what plants to use and u have a short screen timeout.

I suspect the negative reviews are all by a certain developer who keeps advertising his &quot;free&quot; app while demeaning this app in the process! don't believe everything you read! its free today so try it out and see for yourself! after all... you don't really lose anything if you don't like it!
030726999X|2.0|Seemingly far longer than each of the other two, Hornet's Nest certainly drags and has less action for page after page so much of the time that it feels as though another writer took over here and just didn't have the energy or skill that the original author of the first two had. The ending is... VERY good but you sure pay a price for it reading on and on about the Swedish secret police and their interactions with Russian defectors. Compared to the other books, this one is WEAK.
0140434089|1.0|My review is about the Penguin edition, not the novel, which is fantastic. In order to save space, Penguin editions are printed with type size  so tiny that it is unnecessarily difficult to read to read the novels.  I recently discovered this fact to my chagrin when I began reading my copy of the Penguin Moonstone this morning. I ordered it not realizing there was an Oxford edition that is 50 pages longer.  The Oxford editions are priced just as inexpensively as are the Penguins but have far more pages and a normal, very readable type size.   [[ASIN:0199536724 The Moonstone (Oxford World's Classics)]]   I will now order the Oxford edition of The Moonstone; ditto for the Oxford edition of any other work of literature in future.  (Just checked and see that the Oxford edition of Trollope's The Way We Live Now, which I just read, is about 200 pages longer than the Penguin edition.)
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is by far one of my favorite dystopian novels. It follows the story of Jonas, a boy growing up in a post-apocalyptic society where uniqueness and passion of the human condition are shunned in favor of sameness and contentment. But what exactly has been given up and what price has been paid to have such security and routine? Jonas soon learns the answer, and must make a decision that will determine the future of him and society. I found it uniquely refreshing to see what happens when morality, societal values, and individuality are turned on their head. The book itself ends on a bit of a cliff hanger, but reading all 4 books will make it satisfying.
B001GF7WRW|5.0|I got these headphones for music production monitoring. I know that I should be using actual monitors but i didn't have the money at the time so i figured these are better then my laptop speakers. They sound great, you can really hear all of the different sounds clearly. They are built well and are light weight. Very comfortable for long periods of time. They could use a headphones amplifier to get better sounding low end but dont let that stop you from getting them. The semi-open back makes it sound alot more natural. Overall really great headphones for the money.
B0041KKYBA|4.0|The first movie about the economic collapse...it is good.  Explanations for most all that happened and who the principle players were.  I think one comes away with a widened perspective on what took place.  Now, what to do about it is less clear, especially, as pointed out in the movie, many of the folks who brought it all on are the ones 'fixing' it.  The movie could leave one discouraged as to anything realy changing.
B004GYNPL2|4.0|I can't fathom some of these reviews.  I am usually a fairly negative person about apps like this, but this app surprised me.  I've been using a completely inferior method of keeping up with my passwords for a while, just hoping I wouldn't be a target.  Yeah, that's stupid isn't it?<br />This is a great app that works well.  It doesn't bog you down with features, but keeps it simple and straight-forward.  The big deal to me was being able to copy the password and then copying it into another app, like a browser or whatever.  That feature is there and it works well.<br />The only reason I didn't give it a fifth star was because the desktop app is disappointing.  It it highly utilitarian and is only used for backing up and restoring.  You can't, that I can tell, enter or edit data.  I think that feature should come along.<br /><br />It's a great app and it does what it says!

B004GYNPL2|3.0|Not as bad as some have come to make it look, but it does have a few flaws. The big one being that it exports in clear text. Also, the app will show all of your information with just a tap without asking if you're sure or for a password.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|people keep crying about the wifi download and thats really dumb. its 2011, and if you have a phone thats even strong anough to run this game then you should deffinatly be able to afford wifi. and if its that serious that you cant hop into a starbucks or wait until you get home then DONT DOWNLOAD THE GAME. rate the game! not the meens it takes to download it. overall the game is really fun and has high replay value. 5 stars because thats rare in cell phone games.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|I purchased the Verizon Revolution the day it became available. It comes preloaded on the phone.  I have never used the Kindle reader tablets but I do have a reader. The Kindle app on the phone is absolutely great! Finding books are fast and easy on the 4G network it takes only seconds to find the book you want. The Kindle app is easy real to navigate. Having it on my phone is really great because I often find myself at places I don't have my reader and now with my phone my books are always with me!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I must say that this was a great insight to all the hell that broke loose with the housing, banks, investors and more.  If every person that was affected in some way by the housing, insurance, investments and banks situation, you would understand exactly how the madness happen.  People who lost their jobs and the chain affect while those top big wigs took millions of dollars and ran with it now makes sense why the consumer is going through economic hell.  It is a must see and worth the money.
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|I really enjoy this version of the Robin Hood story.  It has the historical accuracy of King Richard not making it back to England after his release from captivity.  It contains scenes which really make the story better.  I've seen the theatrical version several times and have felt lost without the director's selected scenes in the movie to help complete the story.
0307887960|1.0|This diet is really unhealthy: I tried protein diet for couple of weeks - I got really ill: my hair starting falling off, my nails were broken? my skin became dry and itchy - and I never experienced this problem before.

B001UV4XI8|1.0|I never would have purchased this if I had realized how agonizing it would be to watch it.  All of the colors have been sucked out of this production and the contrast has been turned up too far.  It's a depressing film that just goes on and on with nothing happening.  The music is bad.  It is the worst of the all the Potter films.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|The children and I were very excited to finally receive this in the mail.  Unfortunately, upon opening the mail sleeve, we discovered that the Blu-ray packaging had been previously opened.    1).  This was a returned Blu-ray movie sold as new at full price.    The kids did not care as they really wanted to see the movie.  Then we discovered why it was returned:  2).  It will not play(even with updated firmware and another Blu-ray player).  Hopefully, when one orders new movies from Amazon, one will receive the new movies that were purchased in good faith - not previously purchased, malfunctioning ones.  Shame on Amazon for selling previously owned movies that will not play - as ones that are new.    Addendum:  NorAm International Partners, Inc. sold this for Amazon.  Be wary of purchasing from this group.

B004OKFIYU|5.0|For whatever reason, there seems to be a group of MFSL haters out there giving all of their recent work poor reviews.  I'm not sure why, but a couple of them also feel the need to cite their equipment to justify their issues.  Okay, fine.  I'll fire back in favor.<br /><br />Firstly, my home is wired for sound.  Before you get any false ideas from that, I'm a music junkie, not an audio snob, but I did make sure my equipment would do the job.  My system is powered by an Audiopro 1200 & a Samson mixer.  The speakers are B & W for what that's worth.  Sorry if that stuff isn't top end enough for some, but I'm no CEO, doctor, lawyer or pro athlete with money to burn, I'm just a guy who loves music.<br /><br />Now that I've dispensed with that, I've owned Piano Man on vinyl & CD before & this version is flat out, no contest the best.  I hear depth, music & layers that I've never heard before on the entire CD.  The clarity has got to be heard to be believed.  It truly sounds as though the band is right there in the room with me.  It has made some of the songs I wasn't as keen on before sound as good to me as my favorite songs on the CD, which are the title cut, of course, Ballad of Billy the Kid, If I Only Had the Words to Tell You, & Captain Jack.  Travelin' Prayer jumps out with new life & bounce with all the new sounds I hear.  You're My Home has greater & more depth of feeling with the clarity & depth from the sound.  Worst Comes to Worst sounds like a totally different song, with the pop & reggae sounds interspersed like never before.  If it's possible, it makes the song even more lively & dancable than before.  As for the above named songs that are my long-time favorites on the CD, well, let's just say I love them now more than ever before!  Bottom line, you cannot go wrong buying this version of Piano Man, I don't care what anyone tries to tell you.  Even on a regular CD player, the sound just can't be topped.  I can only imagine what a SACD player would do for it!<br /><br />I know what I say may or may not influence anyone to buy this CD.  If the extra money, or bad reviews are too off-putting for you, then your mind may be made up already.  However, if you are on the fence about buying this, do yourself a huge favor, especially if you are a Billy Joel fan, or just a fan of this CD:  Be good to yourself.  Buy yourself a present & get this CD.  You will not be disappointed, it's well worth the extra money.say may or may not influence anyone to buy this CD.

B004IQMXD4|5.0|i may be biased in believing stevie nicks is the greatest songwriter in history for writing deep personal vague mysterious songs that transcend both space and time and that her voice is truly unique and beautiful. but with saying that i must declare this the almost perfect album of it's time. a time when songwriting is repetitive at best- lacking rythm, hooks and depth. IN YOUR DREAMS to me is the single greatest album since THE JOSHUA TREE 24 years ago. every song takes you somewhere. stevie has written even more direct personal letters to songs that are beautifuly produced by dave stewart and glen ballard. these men get stevie-what she wants to say and how she wants it executed and gave her a platform of truth and ease in which to thrive with true collaborations. it doesn't really matter which song came from where or with what inspiration. each song captures stevie's essence and draws the listener in with each successive listening. i am floored at the beauty achieved, sonicaly, vocaly and artisticaly. my faith is renewed for the millenium that great music can still be written. it's about time we get the best!
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|I saw the preview for this when I was watching another movie, I honestly don't remember which but this one looked interesting enough to warrant a rental.<br />The first thing that shocked me was that it was an Eastwood movie.<br />I didn't think this was his sort of thing but he did an excellent job here.<br /><br />Here is what I liked...<br />Excellent performances from the entire cast especially Damon.<br />Beautiful direction.<br />An interesting story.<br />You really have to be interested in the subject of the paranormal to enjoy this movie.<br />Most movies usually make this subject out to be some sort of joke but that is thankfully not the case here.<br />We get three stories that are interwoven and everything wraps up into a neat little package at the end.<br />I have heard other people say this movie was boring and nothing happens.<br />I disagree....nothing happens, everything sort of unfolds...<br />A patient viewer will be rewarded by this movie.<br />If you're expecting a \\"Bourne\\" flick, go elsewhere.<br />This is a VERY slowly paced movie, there's not a whole lot of action, just a whole lot of emotion and story which for once is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was the ending.<br />I DID NOT want the movie to end that way, I won't give it away but I found the ending to be rather annoying.<br />For a movie with so many loose ends for it to wrap so nicely seemed to contradict the entire movie itself.<br />That minor gripe aside, I found it to be a beautiful movie on a an interesting subject.<br />Recommended.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I read this book about 5 years ago. I'll definitely read it again. I wish I would have read it when I was 12 because it would have scared the hell out of me. I was 23 when I read it and it still spooked me in certain parts when I imagined myself in the shoes of some these kids. And if you haven't read his masterpiece,\\"The Dark Tower\\" and you liked,\\"IT\\", then I suggest you read them too. He ties IT, Insomnia, The Talisman, Black House, and Hearts In Atlantis together. I will reread all his Dark Tower books again for the third time.
B004QSQML8|5.0|Long ago in the days of knights, Unicorns, elves, fairies, wizards, demons, goblins, Dwarves and magic. The forces of evil is conducted by the Lord of Darkness (Tim Curry) who has three Goblin assassins like Blix (Alice Playten), Pox (Peter O'Tarrell} and Blunder (Kiran Shah) and  as he sends them to kill 2 unicorns that hold the balance of the universe's goodness in the powers of their horns with the powers of creation and beauty. A lovely princess named Lilly (Mia Sara) with nature loving warrior Jack (Tom Cruise) are taken to see the sacred unicorns until the three goblins kill one of the one horned creatures yet kidnap the other one including Lily. It's up to Jack to join up with an Elf named Gump, a Fairy named Oona and two dwarfs named Screwball (Billy Barty) and BrownTom to save the balance of the universe before the powers of darkness rule forever.<br /><br />A true 80's fantasy masterpiece from Ridley Scott after doing \\"Blade Runner\\" is a visually stunning and unique fantasy epic. The acting is very good and the scores in both US and European Director's Cuts are very good from Tangerine Dream and Jerry Goldsmith but Goldsmith's version is the best since it's a more timeless kind of score that has feeling to it. Tim Curry was absolute perfection portraying the best portrayal of Satan on film thanks to the magic of Rob Bottin's amazing make-up effects especiallly to the other creatures like the Swamp Hag played by Richard Picardo, i must say both cuts are good. In 1984 till mid 85 Scott worked on the film from an original screenplay by William Hjortsberg for Embassy International Pictures and Fox in the UK and other countries, it was a much longer version as they intended with a score from Jerry Goldsmith. However when Universal got the US rights for this movie the filmmakers heavily cut this movie from one hour and 54 minutes to one hour and 30 minutes in a butchered yet altered cut that featured stuff cut out, different alternate angles to show Darkness in teh beginning and a completely different score done by Tangerine Dream. The Movie was a success despite mixed reviews, it has gained a cult following over the years by many kids back then in the 80's including me when i saw this in theaters at 4 with my big brother in St. Louis. Now we got the much superior director's cut with the brilliant Goldsmith score that improves on the original cut which felt badly edited as now the table is complete.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers both the US theatrical cut and International Director's Cut in stunning high definition picture even if it has a few grains but the picture is spectacular as is the sound.

You'll see a big difference between their early releases and this release. LOVE this album! Play it in my car every chance I get. If you are just getting into this band and want a taste of their music prior to all of the heavy based synth sounds, go with this one. Crank it up and piss off your neighbors!
B003SOMYNQ|5.0|Harper Lee was encouraged to write some of her childhood memories. What in the beginning seems like the story of three childhood friends in depression era Macomb, Alabama, turns out to be packed with insights to the makeup of human kind.<br /><br />This story is intriguing on many levels from the history of the area to the stereotyping of people. Most of all every turn was a surprise as told in the first person from the view of Scout Finch. And instead of telling the story in a six year old vocabulary she uses an exceptionally large repertoire to describe the people and events. This story is not as slow passed as one may guess from first glance as every remark and every action will be needed for a future action.<br /><br />A major controversial part of the story is the trial of Tom Robinson. Hoverer this is just a catalyst to help Scout understand the nature of people including her father Atticus and you will find that as important as it is it is just a part of the story with other major characters such as Arthur \\"Boo\\" Radley.<br /><br />Even thought it appears that Scout is the recipient of the insights, I believe we the reader is the real recipient.<br /><br />I can truly say that this book has changed my outlook in life.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0783225857 To Kill a Mockingbird (Collector's Edition)]]
B004DMIIUU|5.0|Far from a perfect movie, but a great movie none-the-less as the whole rises above the parts.  For me, it's the underlying historical themes about fate, personal choices, the lust for power and it's never-ending affect on the world that pushes it over the line.  I truly enjoyed it.  The plot was interesting and complex.  Visually, if you accept the film on its own terms, it's stunning.  It has the usual sense of duty and fate over-whelming personal lives so common in this genre, but with some hopeful twists thrown in.<br /><br />An apt commentary on today's world, at heart, it can be enjoyed on many levels.  Two thumbs up!<br /><br />2011-08-11 Update -- I think about this flawed masterpiece a lot and that's another indication of the substance and value embedded within it.  I'm at 6 decades now, probably not in the target demographic, but I loved this highly original effort.  It definitely struck a chord with me.  Some of the visuals are quite memorable in and of themselves.  Quite an interesting work.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina has always been one of my favorite people on TV because she seems comfortable with herself and knows she's funny without shoving it down your throat like some (Chelsea Handler, I'm talking to you!)comediennes in the biz.      This book didn't disappoint:  Fey is funny, both in her memories of growing up and in her journey to fame (which she still doesn't seem to believe).  I liked her approach and reverence to those women who have gone before her.  She'll definitely be an inspiration for future generations.      I think her best work still lies ahead...and I'll look forward to reading about that in her sequel works!
0385611072|4.0|Tiffany Aching refuses to wear midnight--the dark colors traditional for witches. And though she is growing older, she also refuses to give up the seemingly innocent ways of her people. But when evil looms, she is forced to don the mantle of her craft and stand against the darkness.    The fourth and final book of Terry Pratchett's Tiffany Aching series leads the young witch through physical and personal mine fields, accompanied by the loyal and obstinate Nac Mac Feegle--an army of tiny blue, rowdy, drunken pixies. Not yet 16 years old, Tiffany is now the official witch of the Chalk, her pastoral home region, and must uphold the duties expected of any adult witch. She understands the vagaries of her people, but lacks many of the experiences of her older sister witches.    Something wicked walks the world however. An evil spirit is turning the people against their witches, and it may be Tiffany's fault. When the beloved Baron dies, and Tiffany is blamed, her tenuous standing among the inhabitants grows even more strained. By the customs of her profession, and to prove her abilities to care for her land, Tiffany must stand alone to fight against the Cunning Man, an ancient Omnian witch-hunter returned from the dead. How she fares in this battle decides not only her place among the witches and her people, but also the fate of the world.    Like Douglas Adams and Tom Holt, Pratchett has long been known for his ability to intricately weave social and personal issues with laugh-out-loud humor in a style often unique to British authors. The 38 books of his DiscWorld series have touched upon seemingly every social issue, all while steeped firmly in an outlandish and hilarious fantasy world. And while his Young Adult Tiffany Aching series contains all of these, I Shall Wear Midnight seems especially poignant and insightful. Whereas the first book in the series, The Wee Free Men, introduced a nine-year-old Tiffany and her minuscule band of blue fighters, she was a more innocent, wide-eyed child, who slowly grew through the next two books. In Midnight, however, Tiffany experiences personal moments that all who have suffered the strains of such insecurities have felt. And it is up to her to find the strengths within to overcome the terror--to walk through the flames and accept the Midnight we all must wear, without being consumed by its darkness.    I Shall Wear Midnight is a masterfully fitting and strong end to this series within a series. While it may leave one longing for more adventures of Tiffany and her friends, its resolutions and inspirations confirm that, wherever her journeys may lead, Tiffany and the wee free men will clomp, shout, and muddle through just fine.  - Danny Evarts  This review originally appeared in Shroud Magazine Issue #10, Oct. 2010
B0052UZIFA|1.0|There's nothing about this game that can't be done on an original Droid.  Just an example of lazy programmers trying to make a quick buck.  :-(  Bad programmer, no cookie!
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I will never get tired of watching this movie. I l-o-v-e movies like this. Unrequited love, Yes please!!! I am obsessed with the subject. The last scene( where she's clutching the door handle) kills me every time!!! I could feel her pain. It's so heart wrenching. It always makes me wonder the what if? What if she did it? What if she actually went with him? *sighs* The first time I saw this movie I think I even cried a little, it was that good. I ran out to buy the book because I wanted to be sucked in again. One of the best movies out there.<br />~
B004NOH9LW|4.0|It was about what I expected, especially because I knew it was a Clint Eastwood movie.  All the actors 'fit the bill' perfectly.  To theorize anymore about life after death would have made the movie into a sci fi...  I was just happy that George found happiness.  I like those kind of endings.
B000002LCK|5.0|New Order is hands down my favorite band ever. I finally got to see them live in NYC this past weekend 10/19/12 in NYC. A dream come true.<br /><br />Okay, I can't believe I haven't ever given a review for this cd. I would recommend this album to any New Order newbie. Because it's the ultimate Best of. Start here & then branch off.<br /><br />I can't describe how awesome New Order is. I've been a fan from the beginning, Thank goodness my Aunt was cool before she turned born-again, introducing me to awesome bands back in the day.<br /><br />It's a shame you don't hear enough of New Order on the radio, being that every station sucks these days. The youth of today, you don't know how lucky you have it today with easy access to the internet & the like. Whereas, teenagers in the 80's didn't have that technology back then. I don't know what I would do without satellite (Hello Alternative & Dark Wave) & my personal cd collection & of course the internet. I about fell over my shopping cart at my local grocery store when I shockingly heard Shellshock over the loud speaker one day. I wanted to find that person and thank him or her, for finally having found someone else( besides my husband and I of course) with any sense of good taste in music in this blackhole-of-a-non-cultured-area of NJ I live in.<br /><br />There you go. Get this cd.<br />~
B0017DJ3UW|5.0|One of Mariah's best. It's an album that I go to all year long and not only at Christmas. I highly recommend it!
B004EWEX9Y|5.0|This cable does everything I hoped and more! I was concerned about my phone losing power while watching a movie - no problem, there's a usb cable attached to charge as you watch. Then, I see it also plays YouTube and photo album videos on my TV! Apple kicks a**!
B00004R9A4|4.0|We enjoyed seeing the movie again. It's one of our favorites. The added bonus scenes  were enjoyable.  This is a classic movie that everyone should have in their collection.    The seller had the movie to us in a short amount of time and we appreciated that as well.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The game is fun and addicting but it crashes after 2 games all of the time. It not only crashes but I have to completely restart my phone everytime, I hope they fix it because it is getting rather annoying. It'll get a five star when this problem is fixed
B004GYNPL2|3.0|Had no problem installing it on my DROIDX. Makes me wonder about all the other bad reviews or was the person who couldn't install on their DROIDX unable to install any app. Just try it like I'm doing and make up your own mind..l gave it three stars because I didn't have a problem installing it as was reported in the reviews but haven't used the app yet.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Really enjoyed this up until 3.8.  This is when the game started to reload every 10-15 seconds. Too bad, I had hoped to finish the game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I definitely am pleased with this app. Another amazon first release.. Very fun and gets very addicting too. Strongly reccommend, you will not be disappointed.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great game. smooth and well done except if a pop up text or call appears then it takes a long time to reload which is annoying
0596009208|5.0|i love this book cuz it's easy to read and well priced , as a java beiginner i found it very helpfull although it's missing a little on the generics subject
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is my favorite of all the Miyazaki movies.  I don't know about all fo the philosophy   behind this but I love the artist expression and the journey the main character takes.  I think the characters in this are the best and most creative of all the Miyazaki movies I've seen.  And I DO get some of the philosophy behind some of them like the river dragon of pollution. I love the idea of other hidden realms and how we might get trapped in them.  This is one of those movies I think that doesn't have what I call slow spots.  It keeps going and you are just as interested in watching the middle and end as the beginning.  I plan to watch this again and look for things I missed.  I just got a book as a gift that is a perfect companion to this.  I love it too.[[ASIN:1569317771 The Art of Spirited Away]]  It has really beautiful art.
B000002LEE|5.0|by far the best album janes addiction has ever made. it is not as sentimental as ritual lo habitual, which in my mind is a good thing
B001AQT0OU|4.0|Misunderstood when it was first released (audiences and critics in the U.S. thought that \\"Barry Lyndon\\" might be a bit like the ribald \\"Tom Jones\\" before seeing it rather than a period drama that tried to capture the \\"feel\\" of 18th century painting), \\"Barry Lyndon\\" remains a beautifully photographed if slightly static period piece.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer looks quite nice with a transfer that improves signficantly on the previous DVDs. This isn't in the 1.66 aspect ratio that Kubrick indicated he wanted it projected at in his letter to projectionists dated 12/8/75 (\\"Barry Lyndon\\" was photographed in 1-1:66 aspect ratio. Please be sure to project it at this ratio and in no event at less than 1-1:75\\"). This version is presented in a 1.78:1 aspect ratio. So this is OUTSIDE of the director's choice. Warner has insisted THIS is the correct aspect ratio based on discussion with Kubrick's long time assistant Leon Vitali.<br /><br />Keep in mind that Kubrick meant the film to have a slightly soft quality because of the lighting choices and filters used to shoot the film so the look of the movie is inherently somewhat soft to begin with and the depth of field (particularly during the candlelit scenes)is very limited but, again, that's due to an extremely fast lens and the use of the lighting source for those scenes).<br /><br />We don't get any special features (a commentary track would have been nice)but we do get the original theatrical trailer for the film (unlike \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" which has all the special features from the previous DVD as well as the documentary on Kubrick that was part of the boxed set of movies).
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I've had this already 6 months (galaxy tab) and it perfectly meets my needs. Its customizable, easy to use, and will hold anything you want to remember and not share. No complaints. Good purchase. I would have liked to get this free.
0792838068|1.0|Self-centered people who lack any self-awareness engaging in stupid behaviour is not tragedy; it's just a pointless waste of time for its viewers. Add in a soundtrack that has all the nuance of a Mickey Mouse cartoon and it's enought to make you demand your money back.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|i gont get why there are so many bad reviews, i freaking loved this film...but then again i have always been the type to like what others didnt... but none the less...it had great action and i think that amber heard did a great job in this film...im so glad that its out so that i can own it
B004GYNPL2|5.0|Very easy to use and super helpfull. Really glad this app is finally free. Don't listen to the &quot;haters&quot;, they must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
B004EPYZQC|5.0|when i found out they were coming out with another one, i got excited and wanted to watch it, but i didnt have high hopes, i mean come on...5 movies, there is rarely ever five sequels that come out and are stil good and fun to watch...there are movies where the second one blows horriblely, so like i said, no high hopes...but i was far from wrong...i really loved this movie..i think that it might be my favorite out of all of them...i saw a comment that said that you couldnt give it five stars cus it was far from perfect and unrealistic...i mean its a movie...i never really go into a movie and expect it to be down right perfect and believable...i mean i go for the entertainment, and this movie really did the job, i cant wait for it to come out so i can by it...i mean you cant judge a movie by it realistic state, i mean i guess you can, but what fun is that...so anyways, for any fast and furious fan that hasnt seem this movie yet, i highly recomend it, i would def. recomend for your collection(if you have one)(i do ;))
B001UV4XI8|5.0|So as you all know, this is Part 1 of the last Harry Potter movie/book. Them deciding to split the final movie into 2 parts was a good move on their part. This way they can include everything from the last book and make it into a fitting end to one of the greatest franchises that we've seen in awhile. The Deathly Hallows Part 1 picks up where the Half Blood Prince leaves off and starts off with alot of action. The characters we've grown with through each and every single movie have grown up as well. We learn in this movie how much they think of each other and how much their lives intertwine with everything in the world of Harry Potter. It is a great adventure and after seeing it you will be waiting on the edge of your seat for Part 2 in July.
B00003CX5P|5.0|So my 8 year old daughter and I sat down and watched all six Star Wars films over the course of a week. I had waited some time to show her these movies because some of the scenes are pretty intense, but since she's a clever and surprisingly mature girl, I was fairly certain she could handle it when she expressed her usual, unbridled enthusiasm to watch the saga.<br /><br />After all, I was 8 myself when my father took our family to see Star Wars back in 1977. He told my brother and I that it was an important film we needed to see. To say it made an impact on me - and by extension, my generation - would be an understatement, but this isn't about my experience and what I felt the first time I saw it. I've been talking about that stuff for more than thirty years now. This is about what my daughter experienced having seen all six films this week.<br /><br />Before I continue I will say one thing, however. I like both the originals and the prequels. I'm not a disgruntled fanboy by any means. But for years I have been made to feel by people my own age that I should be unhappy with what Lucas did with episodes 1-3. But the truth is, I don't feel unhappy. In fact, I love them as much as I love the originals. So when my daughter and I sat down to watch the films, I watched her as much as I did the movies, and she confirmed for me a few suspicions I've been having all these years.<br /><br />She loved the story line, the jokes, the droids, and especially Jar-Jar, who came across as a wonderfully comic actor; was frightened and dazzled by many of the aliens and monsters; instantly fell in love with Padme but was also charmed by Anakin and his selflessness. The pod race had us on the edge of our seats, and the accomplishments of someone her age made her more excited about her own possibilities than I could have anticipated.<br /><br />And after seeing her reactions I realized something; Lucas' legacy is in safe hands; the people who dislike these films obviously came to the theater with expectations and disappointed themselves in the process. They've spent more time whining about what the films could have been than simply enjoying them. My daughter's joy was all the proof I needed that Lucas got it right. And I have yet to meet a child her age, or any teenager (or twenty something for that matter), who hasn't been delighted with the films from start to finish.ppointed themselves in the process.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I got PvZ when it was the Amazon free App of the day, but I would definitely recommend buying it!! It is so fun and addictive. Great strategy game that require lots of attention. This is a must have.
B0015UKX7Y|4.0|Heard this on the way to a show the other day and was really taken by it (long review forthcoming).
B004N66XYE|5.0|Its like everyday life in our world today. You have a life of romance, scandal, and some amusing events. There is secrecy and of course lies.  The elegant furnishings, clothes, hair styles, are very primm and proper for that era. Also its like the haves and have nots. Of course there is always factional scheming for power. Lots of excitment.
B000FC12Z0|4.0|This is not the first classic mystery I have read, nor is it my first Agatha Christie mystery. It is, however, the first featuring M. Hercule Poirot. This is clearly a work in the classic English mystery tradition. It tends towards the cerebral, so it will likely not appeal to those who prefer action, violence, and gore. And it probably is also not well suited for those who like to play armchair detective, since Poirot often observes fact not previously mentioned. Still, it is a well written classic which kept my interest until the very end.
B00007KLJJ|1.0|This version of Four Feathers can't even be compared with the original produced in 1939.   The story line was harder to follow. There were too many dark scenes where nothing could be seen.  Also, characters were added that were not in the original.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game is smooth as butter on my Inspire 4g, even the end graphics. unfortunately, the game graphice leave something to be desired.
1439130833|1.0|I was under the impression that this was a book and instead its like a pad with a saying for everyday of the year. Dislike! Should have read better but it could have been explained that it wasn't in book form. I will re-gift it and maybe a friend will enjoy it, but for the meantime I still want to read the book that I thought I was ordering in the first place.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|\\"Sail\\", the lead single from AWOLNATION's \\"Megalithic Symphony\\", is a genre-blending atmospheric anthem.  With its fuzzy sound, accessible hook and raw emotion, it instantly captivated me.  It's one of those songs that demands you find out more about the artist.    The samples of the rest of the songs were also good, but I wasn't \\"sold\\".  Fortunately the band posted videos online for practically all the tracks with lyrics.  Truthfully, I remained unconvinced after first listen.  The songs seemed a bit frenetic and all over the place.  Catchy choruses mixed with raging verses and back and forth they went - abrupt changes in single songs.  Additionally, I tend to appreciate, at least lastingly, more organic and less synthetic sounds.  Nonetheless, the temptation remained.  After a few more listens I decided to take the chance - dreading the possible disappointment of being let down by a promising new find.    Thankfully Aaron Bruno (whose appearance does not hint at his rare rock-ability) and AWOLNATION deliver abundantly on their stunningly good debut effort.  He's a genius at producing memorable and catchy melodies.  His vocals are first rate and diverse - from tonally pleasing screams to silky smooth refrains.  I won't suggest that the lyrics are ground-breaking or profound, but they are meaningful and reflective (e.g., \\"My mirror disappoints me\\").  It's a welcome change from the trite and forgettable lyrics that dominate pop music.  They successfully marry so many styles: rock, hip-hop, electronic, gospel, blues, etc.  An irresistible energy permeates the project.    The artistry extends to the packaging of the product itself (for those getting the CD).  The textured artwork, designs and pictures, and even the track titles being listed in code all contribute to the suggestion that maybe there's something more to this than just another rock or pop album.    I do wonder if their live sound compares favorably to the recording.  I just hope to have the chance to findout.  I also wonder if the appeal will last.  Is this a classic album?  I honestly don't know.  I worry it might not be.  But this I do know: it's fresh and it hits the spot right now.  And that's enough.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book is a simple and clear toolkit for success.  Seth always says \\"ship it\\" but what does that mean and why does he say that all the time?  This book explains it and harps on the same steps through the book.<br /><br />I speed read most of what I read these days, and skim the rest.  Even for the busy entrepreneur this book will make an impact.  I promise you that if you practice and follow the approach he outlines you WILL succeed.  What he wrote here is true.

B0034G4ORM|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out. Is a good movie. Many people that saw the movie and said it was bad when ask why they said it was bad they just say because they din't tell from were the aliens came or for what. Seriously? If something like this ever happend will they give us an explanation?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the best tower defense games out there and I've tried many of them. Just fun. However when you get a lot on screen and you get a call our app that barnes in it doesn't outside/save the game. You can lose an entire level you are about to finish because of a call, frustrating.  Droid X<br /><br />Update:  They fixed the saving problem when the game is interrupted a while ago and since then other than some slow down on levels towards the end when crammed with enemies it ran great on my Droid X.
0805028846|5.0|I love this book.  For anyone interested in creating pop up art/cards...this book is great.  It gives good instruction from the basics to the more intricate techniques. It's a worthy purchase.
0307237699|5.0|It doesn't take very many pages to realize that the author of this book is an extremely intelligent person who speaks to your listening where you can relate to his feelings.  He speaks from the heart.  I guess this is why he was elected the President of the Harvard Law Review and the President of our country and why Donald Trump did not get into Harvard nor ever will be the Pesident of our country.  I did not read this book like any other book that I've read and just skimmed over the pages, but tried to absorb every word on every page to feel what he was communicating to his readers. Truly extraordinary person...  I don't believe the Republicans will ever field a candidate to run against him in the 2012 election because no one feels they are smart enough and right now they all look like idiots and the more they deny that fact, the more ridiculous they appear to any of us.  And I am a Republican for most of my life who is shamefully running down to City Hall to change my party preference.  Enough is enough of these sufferings of unmitigated stupidity...

B004JN1D2I|1.0|I would absolutely buy this series except for the price!  It is wondrous to me that the Kindle price is what it is.  For this reason alone I won't buy the print edition and I really want the publisher to hear this.  I get the preferrence for paper and print, I love that--but I find that I love my Kindle too.  I get to read what I want to read when I am moved to read it.  There is a further point to make which the publisher clearly isn't getting; if I really love a book it will wind up on my physical shelf, taking up my very precious physical shelf space.  The truth is I have too many books in cheap editions taking up space where more precious books should be.  I am one of those unfortunate people, I try to discard books but they constantly stick to my hand; books I can't be bothered to read, books that bore me, books that are poorly written or just plain stupid, they all stick to my hand so I can't discard them or even give them away.  I have so many books taking up space because they arrived before the technology did.  I am very sure that I am not the only one like this in the world; afflicted with sticky books taking up space.  Let me head you off at the pass, before you contemptuously recommend that I call the hoarders show for help, I suggest that you reconsider your assumptions about we Kindle readers.  Kindle readers are readers, I think we love books and look the feel and smell of them; we may be, too, an inpatient bunch because we like to hear what in fact they have to tell us.  Times have moved such that for the most part we are allowed satisfy this in a way, an intoxicating way, never before available and it is delicious.  The Kindle allows me to pick and choose what is worthy to be on my shelf, it may even push off things that don't deserve to be there--at least that is the hope.    Finally there is this and it may be completely snotty, afterall you have barred me from reading the books,--just because someone includes an 'RR' in their name and writes fantasy doesn't make them a Tolkien level writer.  In fact it seems a convenient comparison of illteration which to actual readers is irritating, and lazy on the part of reviewers, but I don't know because the publisher.....    In the end the readers make the determination of value.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Are you tired of watching mysteries where you've figured all of answers before the second commercial break? Prepare to be challenged.  This series has crisp, witty writing that keeps the viewer's mind active and entertained. Unlike some of the Sherlock series and movies where the show ends with Sherlock explaining how he came to his \\"brilliant deductions\\" this Sherlock series reveals deductions in process or shortly after. Can't wait for season two.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|This blu-ray concert is the one that I enjoy watching over and over again.     Much more than a jam session, much more than great musicians, much more than the great music, you have to watch this simply for the pure concert experience.        With the preceding noted, every single band member is great and the lead singer,  Brandon Flowers, works hard to please the fans, giving the impression of being a polite, and friendly, Southern gentleman.      (If you love the blu-ray, I strongly suggest getting the CD/DVD version too.  The CD, which has most of the live songs, is mixed somewhat differently, giving a great sounding and slightly different aural experience.)

B000002UCN|3.0|\\"Think for Yourself,\\" \\"For You Blue,\\" \\"You,\\" \\"Bangladesh,\\" and \\"Dark Horse\\" should not have been on this CD because they are second-rate songs that were not hits, and what in hell were the producers of this CD thinking when they left \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" off this CD, which was a first-rate song and a hit?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is soooooooooo addictive. I love it! There are over 20 levels and the more you play the more addictive the game becomes.
B004G600A4|3.0|The DVD was brand new but was very badly scratched when we opened it. It skipped a few seconds and froze twice towards the beginning of the movie. Besides that the quality was good.
B004LWZW42|5.0|The first and second X-Men films were wonderfully satisfying to this comic book collector. The third movie perverted the comic's most famous and poignant storyline, disgusting most fans and doing nothing to impress the casual moviegoer. It is generally agreed upon that the missing mind, the one that would have put the brakes on some of the worst injures of that second sequel, was Bryan Singer's. He had left the movie to direct Superman Returns.    Singer Returns to his Gifted Youngsters in \\"X-Men: First Class,\\" sitting in the producer's seat this time. He also penned the story. Matthew Vaughn, who directed and co-wrote the screenplay, continues to further the argument that British writers and directors have a better feel sometimes, for American Icons, than us Yanks.     There are a few flaws. Despite what Charles Xavier would tell you, the place between \\"serenity and rage\\" is called \\"even-tempered.\\" However the few complaints one might make are trivial. X-Men:First Class offers the most comprehensive and sympathetic portrayal of Magneto yet, makes you care about Alex Summers, a character no one in the comic book ever new what to do with and somehow changes the nationalities and professions of Moira McTaggert and Sean Cassidy - and the origin of Mystique - without offending hardcore fans (at least this one). And for what it's worth, the film offers quite a lot of world and U.S. history.    X-Men: First Class also offers the best cameo ever, one worth the price of admission - and also worth it's own paragraph in this review.     The film came out yesterday. I signed up to be alerted by Amazon as to when the DVD was released today. So, I'm sure, have thousands of others.
B003Q6D2B4|2.0|I am so thankful that we consumers have more than one way to watch a movie like this what a dog  After about 30 mins of this stupid dialog and decided to watch one of my old movies that you do not mind watching again. RED is a 1 time view at best poor acting, poor plots, goofy lines, I am afaid it only gets 2 stars or D and I am being  kind at that and the movie makers can do better than this and until they do I will save my hard money for a truly excellent one.

0425242099|5.0|This book was such a wonderful continuation of the conflicts building in Play of Passion--Singh continues to amaze me with her intelligence & imagination & writing skill.   She weaves a beautiful story, and this book is no exception.    It IS slower-paced than some of her earlier works.  However, the detail she gives to Hawke's back-story is incredible.  She really gave the SnowDancer Alpha his due.    A delightful read, a heart-pounding ending...I cannot wait for her next Psy-Changeling Saga installment!
0307460444|5.0|I love this book. So far I've made 3 of the recipes and got outstanding compliments. The cupcakes do seem a little dense but for me, that is normal for a homemade cake. It also takes longer to bake the cupcakes than what the book says. Overall, the cupcakes are pretty easy to make and taste great!
B004SBQAL0|2.0|I had high hopes for this film but the entire movie feels like a bad high school kids tv show it gets really old with the romance and all that the story its pretty weak and alex pettyfer its an irritating guy i honestly cant stomach the guy he just pisses me off the entire movie the movie itself has some action scenes that are decent but most of the movie its like an episode of dawsons creek and its not good i would say just fast forward the movie to the ending that its the only entertaining part in the entire film.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The best game on the market..  i had it on my iphone and I'm glad that I can have it on my galaxy s it's fun,  the graphics are not awesome but they are very descent I don't really have a complaint :)  you should buy it!!
B00000GAIW|5.0|Absolute classic I was pleasently suprised it was the 25th Anniv album. Ian is an unbelievable talent who Robert Plant should envy. All in all.. great album..nice extra cuts..I have been spinning in my car for 3 weeks straight. Yee haw!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Lots of fun, best game for Android yet! Do I really have to make this be 20 words long? that is an wacky requirement.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is one of the most addictive games I've ever played for PC, and seeing it come to Android is awesome. The game itself gets 5/5 stars, but the app is 4 just because it gets a little sluggish sometimes, and once crashed my phone. But the game is so fun it makes up for it. Droid 2
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Got the game free, but would recommend buying for those that missed out. Good game play, humorous, and progressively challenging. A great time waster, you'll have trouble putting down. Plays smooth on EVO. Recommend!
B00479SVBU|1.0|I previously gave this product 5 stars because of it's versatility (sdhc card, usb stick, mp3 player), and because of the clarity, but the build quality is not so good. It's plastic and at first seems ok enough to overlook but mine already broke. I've only been using maybe 2-3 times a week for the past month and a half, and I am careful with it: don't put it loose in any bags and i don't leave it in the car so that it isn't damaged from heat. the other day as I was pulling it out of the cig lighter the end popped open and all of the internal workings sprang out, so it's not working anymore obviously. So something else to factor in if you're thinking about purchasing this, and a warning to those with this already, just treat it very very delicately.
B003YOZNBU|5.0|This was as I expected it to be a great item for the money. Arrived quickly, Played perfectly.  Will buy from Amazon again.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Best birthday gift, by far (I even bought one for my sister). I've watched them at least 3 times since I received it, and haven't had any problems with the DVDs. Love the special features and the guide to Gilmore-isms that came with it.
B00006AW2G|3.0|Great CD.  The sequence of the songs listed on the back of the CD are in an incorrect order. The CD plays the correct order.
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|I've read the books and when I heard about the show, I thought it would be stupid. But I watched the pilot and I've been hooked on Pretty Little Liars since! The plot and characters are so unique and well written, but slightly differ from the book. All of the characters have different secrets that A, thought to be missing best friend Alison is sending, involving the past and present. Aria is in a secret relationship with her English teacher, Hanna shoplifts and is bulimic, Spencer has stolen her sister's boyfriend and fiancee, and Emily, my favorite, is a closeted lesbian with an attraction to her new friend Maya and had one to Alison. Alison's body is found, but A's messages keep on coming. Now they're two questions. Who's A and who killed Alison? This is an AMAZING show! I would recommend it to anyone! I can't wait for new episodes starting June 14!!
0316098329|5.0|\\"Room\\" is a stunner that you can't put down.a mother and child in captivity? How could this possibly be an engaging story? The narrative voice, told through the voice of a five your old boy,never falters or wavers. Absolutely nailed the memories of my own son at that age, in regards to language, thoughts, the marvelous innocence before abstract thought...and the bravery of the mother and her gentle, boundless love... \\"room\\" is a \\"darkly beautiful\\" story, a fast read that you will not want to put down. amazing.... The story transitions into the 'outside world\\" just beautifully. \\" I believe \\"Room\\" should be used as a reading requirement for college level psychology/education courses. leaving creepy predator behind, the story encompasses so much more.
0525423273|4.0|Rated 4.5<br /><br />The first time I saw this book, I was sure I did not want to read it. Then came the avalanche of 5 star reviews for the book, but I was still against it. Why? The title and the cover made it seem like a YA version of a mushy romance novel. I really can't say what made me read this book when I was so vehemently against it; whatever it was, I'm so glad that I did because I think I fell in love with Anna and the French Kiss within the first 10 pages of the book.<br /><br />It is not a romance novel after all. Yes, there is romance , the kind that makes you go all dreamy.... But Anna and the French Kiss is about so much more. That's the best thing about it - it has so much more depth than what you might believe. Don't let the title deceive you! It took me back to my teenage days and through Anna's eyes, I visited Paris, which has been a lifelong dream of mine.<br /><br />Anna is probably my favorite YA heroine. You need to read this book to find out how full of awesome she is. She reminds me a little bit of Mia from Princess Diaries. I can't say why exactly. Maybe because after a long long time, a YA protagonist actually seems so relatable, which I previously felt with Mia. Anna talks and behaves like a teenager, she feels things the way you would expect a teenager to feel - I could back to my teenage days and remember feeling things exactly the way she does. The author has perfectly captured what it is to be a teenage girl; none of the teenage characters act like they are 30 years old or worse, 10 years old! The characterization is perfect!<br /><br />Anna is my favorite, but Etienne St.Clair comes very very close. Yes, THE Etienne St. Clair on whom many bloggers have been drooling all over. I have joined that gang of drooling, love-sick girls. I think I can come up with hundred reasons for why I love Etienne, but in order not to bore you to death, I will list only the major ones:<br />- He's not one of those generic dark, dangerous, bad boys, of whom I am SICK of.<br />- He's sooo sweet and friendly; yet, he is not without flaws.<br />- He has a BRITISH ACCENT !<br />In short Etienne St.Clair = Epitome of hotness<br />In fact, he is now on my top ten list of most swoon-worthy fictional guys. (I am sorry, Etienne - you are amazing but Mr.Darcy and John Thornton are still my top two.)<br /><br />There are so many moments in Anna and the French Kiss that made me giggle like crazy, moments that made me go \\"awww\\", moments that touched me and moments that almost made me cry. I could go on and on!<br /><br />I love Anna and Etienne's relationship. It doesn't straightaway plunge into \\"I'm passionately in love with you. I would DIE for you, kill for you etc.\\" It moves at a slow pace. They start off as friends; the slow development makes the wait more delicious. The beauty of the romance is in the tension that the author slowly builds up. I could almost see sparks flying between Anna and Etienne in every scene they are together. So when those two actually fall in love, I could understand why. No insta-love here!<br /><br />Read Anna and the French Kiss! Believe me , you will be surprised, just like I was. I read this book in one sitting when I had an important exam the next day. I did not even regret it! There's friendship, loneliness, love, heartbreak and so much more in this gem of a novel.<br /><br />Overall:<br />Paris + hot guy with a British accent = Perfectionsweet and friendly; yet, he is not without flaws.   - He has a BRITISH ACCENT !   In short Etienne St.Clair = Epitome of hotness   In fact, he is now on my top ten list of most swoon-worthy fictional guys.

B000BT97AO|5.0|I stumbled upon this Movie a couple of years ago. It is visually Incredible!<br />Surreal imagery is Magically blended with Reality.<br />The story is a somewhat classic story of teenage angst and regret. Yet, it is<br />wonderfully told through a creative British Cast.<br />Oh, and let me not forget the music! Incredible!<br />Highly recommended!

B004UXUSIM|5.0|Woody's heroes/heroines are the romantics of all epics, eternally uncertain of themselves & their place in the world (so he loves F. Scott & Zelda); but here he also professes admiration for the clear-sighted who offer advice to the lost romantics among us (so he loves Hemingway & Stein as well); and there's even a passing nod of recognition to the unhinged (Dali, Bunuel, Man Ray).<br /><br />His villains are those who use intellect or artistic talent as a weapon of seduction or social dominance. And American pragmatism/materialism that seems designed to alienate us from our finer qualities.<br /><br />With Midnight in Paris, Woody Allen continues his critique of American identity/aspirations. Like Henry James, he finds it easiest to study Americans when they are in foreign locales. But all of the old themes are here as well (underconfident romantic up against overconfident poser; romantic/artistic disappointment tempered by humor; bittersweet Chaplinesque ending).<br /><br />The only thing that makes the 70's Woody Allen films (Annie Hall, Manhattan) better than the current series (Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Midnight in Paris) is the absence of Woody Allen. This was not as noticable with Vicky Cristina Barcelona because the leads were female, but here its almost impossible not to imagine a younger Woody doing all of his signature things with this role. Owen Wilson does a fine job here, but Woody Allen himself playing this character and talking to Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Stein, Picasso, Dali etc....would have been out of this world.
B001HN694K|5.0|The book ALICE IN WONDERLAND is like a Gnostic Gospel to me, and forms the cornerstone of my personal mythology. I was hesitant about watching this latest film version because I thought I'd be too critical about any major changes. Well, I'm with the hundreds of other reviewers who were blown away by Tim Burton's ALICE IN WONDERLAND. The original storyline provides the launching pad for Burton & Company's imaginations to romp riotously through a landscape of fabulous color hues, textures & nuances. Every single production value including but not limited to Actors, Music, Wardrobe, Sets, Cinematography--Direction, of course--well, you get the picture--are of the highest calibre. This film can be enjoyed by all ages & introduces a whole new generation to ALICE. Maybe they'll be encouraged to read the original book as well.<br /><br />BRAVO!<br /><br />PS. I was very critical of Miranda Richardson's Red Queen in the earlier version of ALICE, as well as critical of Helena Bonham Carter's rather vapid performance in SWEENY TOOD. Well, I thought she was wonderful as the Red Queen. It's true that animation was involved, but HBC's skill radiates nonetheless. She's adorable & fun to watch.

014241543X|5.0|Crying by page 22. Speechless. Intensely beautiful. Desperately romantic.<br /><br />If I Stay is another book that I won't write much on in fear of not doing it justice. Gayle Forman really got this novel right from the first breath to its last.<br /><br />Composed of present day happenings and past flashbacks, If I Stay is the tragic tale about how even the most innocent of trips can turn into your worst nightmare.  This story revolves around eighteen year old, musically inclined, Mia, her family, and her boyfriend.  Each voice you come across in this book is perfectly-un-perfect and I couldn't help fall in love with them all for one reason or another.<br /><br />Never take anything for granted... this book was impossible for me not to become immediately emotionally vested in because it felt like I was the one there, laying in the ICU hospital bed, remembering all of the moments which made up my life, listening to the hustle and bustle around me, learning the tragic truths of what would be my life if I choose to let go or decide to go back to it.  I felt like the ghost that was floating around watching those left mourn for me and make promises to me near lifeless corpse.  Needless to say, tissue was a must.<br /><br />One theme of this book that brought it altogether, and make sense of what otherwise wouldn't have, was the music that bound it together.  Mia's parents, Mia's brother, Mia's boyfriend and herself.  It all played a part in this story, helping form each character's personality and giving everyone a common ground, a driving passion for life.  Everyone's love for music gave this story a background melody that played while I devoured this book in one sitting.<br /><br />If I Stay is a truly beautiful book composed of numerous parallels that gives this book a depth I couldn't ignore and couldn't help but respect.  Even with the sorrow that accompanies this book there is plenty of smiles to be found in the flashbacks of memories.  Despite the life-changing events and when nothing seems worth it anymore, there is hope found to grasp onto.  Even having no clue which decision is ultimately the right decision there is solace found in knowing that love awaits you no matter which way you go.  If I Stay is truly breath taking and despite it's size bares an impact that will follow me, follow you.<br /><br />Cover: 5<br />Characters: 5<br />Plot: 5<br />Re-Readable: Yes!<br />Overall: 5+<br /><br />On the cover:  I definitely appreciate the paperback cover over the hardback cover.

B004FOA84A|5.0|This game is rather short, but it is fun nonetheless. Stumped me a couple of times.Takes me back to my MYST days.
0525422943|5.0|Writing this review is even harder then writing the review for If I Stay, which took me over a month to write.<br /><br />Rather then picking up directly where If I Stay left off, Where She Went picks up three years later and this time it is Adam who guides us from his spot in stardom with his band, Shooting Star.  Adam was almost unrecognizable at first but that laid the wood work for the emotional roller coaster that was this not-even-sad book.  I mean, really, how does one cry when the book isn't really that sad.<br /><br />Who knew the stepping stones for Where She Went were not only Mia's accident and Adam and Mia's mutual love for music, even if from different spectrums, but Adam's promise,<br />\\"If you stay, I'll do whatever you want. I'll quit the band; go with you to New York. But if you need me to go away, I'll do that too. .. And that would suck, but I'll do it. I can lose you like that, if I don't lose you today. I'll let you go. If you stay.\\"<br /><br />At the risk of sounding extremely vague Mia's character was nothing compared to the complexity of Adam's.  The weight of his voice, his emotions, and the way that one promise paved the path for what was his life, all contributed to this extremely raw and emotional read.  Even being from Adam's point-of-view, through his eyes I was still able to see the emotions of others, for as off track as Adam was painted in his story I was still able to pick through his eyes and piece together the emotions that mattered.<br /><br />Gayle Forman truly is brilliant with If I Stay and now Where She Went.  She give us two books that formed one extremely moving, thorough, story.  With having had both Mia and Adam's points of views I was able to see all sides of these characters, piecing together the story of their lives and the weight of their love and how it affected them.  Gayle concluded Where She Went beautifully, as well as the story of Mia and Adam.  Even if it wasn't straight out of a fairy tale.<br /><br />Cover: 5<br />Characters: 5<br />Plot: 5<br />Re-Readable: YES!<br />Overall: 5+: YES!  Overall: 5+

0061726826|5.0|I can't even begin to imagine living in a time when love is viewed as a disease and the right to love is taken away from me and is punishable by death if I try escaping The Cure.  Amor Deliria Nervosa, that was what you were supposedly at risk of contracting if you fell in love.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver created a world in Delirium which never felt safe and felt so foreign that I couldn't believe I could actually see this happening.  I mean, really, if you think about it, I could see there being a time when the government says humankind's downfall is our emotion, our love.  That thought alone added another factor of fear to the story, one that was already elevated from the start.<br /><br />Our main character, Lena, was about to turn eighteen, to graduate, and about to embark on what would be the test that eventually led her into the loveless, content, arms of a man she would be told to spend the rest of her life with.  Her match.  She would make a life with this man, have children with this man, yet never actually feel the driving passion behind what is otherwise considered Amor Deliria Nervosa.<br /><br />Lena fears her government, with right, and despite what she has been trained to think and feel she can't help but see more then she should.  She isn't the only one in her story that sees more then they should ever admit.  Her best friend is who opens her clouded vision to a secret word that exist between their walls, one in which people hold on to every last bit of freedom before they are forced to give themselves up to The Cure.<br /><br />Lena's struggle with accepting The Cure is rooted deeper then most.  It isn't basic anxiety or the fear of being herded like cattle that truly hurt her, it is the story of her Mother and the fact that she is unable to pull her eyes away from a guy, Alex, who is introduced into her life in an abrupt and dangerous manner.  By a second chance meeting her life is thrown into a whirlwind of struggle and acceptance for what are the truths behind her life, her government, and Amor Deliria Nervosa.<br /><br />All of the characters I was introduced to played their parts well.  The only characters I found flat, weren't really flat, just tight knit into their rolls in a society where the only emotion that really ran high was fear.  Lena, despite being set in her ways, grew while her story did and most everything she did or said was justified by how she grew up, it wasn't just some random unexplained action void of motive.  It only made her story that much more tragic as it began to unfold.  Alex, was the perfect compliment to Lena.  He was able to make her feel things she never had before, and it was more then just a flutter in her tummy.  He was also able to show her truths about her life which helped her make the biggest decisions of her life.  Even if their story would have ended when it came her time for The Cure, the only thing their time together lacked was more time to be together.<br /><br />Despite the slow-going first part of this book, once I crossed that threshold I really couldn't put it down. I became immersed in a world I was scared to death of but felt like I was living in.  Every anxiety felt like it was connected to me, every pitter-patter of Lena's heart, or Alex's, my own mimicked.  The shade of the sunset let me fall in love, just as it had its affect of Alex and Lena.  When you read it, you will know what I mean.<br /><br />Read on from this point with caution, no big spoilers, just a nice warning to those weak of heart:<br /><br />Prepare yourself for the cliff hanger and the possible ruin that will be yourself if you are not careful.  There is a possibility you will need your inhaler, if you own one, and a box of tissue.  I still haven't recovered from what has to one of the most intense and heart wrenching endings I have ever experienced.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver brilliantly painted a portrait of a world we had reason to fear but wanted to fall into, if just to feel that longing and love Lena did.  Book number two, Pandemonium, could not come fast enough.<br /><br />Cover: 5<br />Characters: 5<br />Plot: 5<br />Re-Readable: YES!<br />Overall: 5e fast enough.      Cover: 5  Characters: 5  Plot: 5  Re-Readable: YES!  Overall: 5
030746363X|4.0|I have bought this book a while back, when i look at the suggestion in this book have provided, and i am very sceptical that some of the advise given. For example : I bought this book to lose weight, and of the tips in this books is that if you can lower your body tempature for a short period of time, you be able to lose weight. Well sound absurd right? I try it, and it works!!!!<br /><br />  Ever since i continue to follow his suggestion about diet and the exercise recommended, and i have been able to lose weight since. With my starting weight of 200 pounds, in 2 months i been able to shed 20 pounds. Mind you, this is done with very minimal work, change abit of my eating habits, work out 3 times a week for 15min each. That 45min for a total of 7 days.<br /><br />  I strongly recommend anyone who doesnt have alot of time on their hands but who want a healthy and better fitness, you cannot go wrong with the advise given in this book. This is pure gold!!!!!

B0051QIGP4|1.0|I'm really glad I bought this cd for .99 because that is all it is worth.    I bought The Fame, and The Fame Monster, both great cds, you can dance you can listen again and again to great tracks like Bad Romance... This disc??? As she frequently repeats in one track \\"sh-t\\" in German....  If the cover wasn't a clue in enough (I should have suspected something went awry)........    Song Breakdown    1) marry the night- the most tolerable song on the cd.  The intro is nice, but the lyrics are rather pathetic \\"I'm a soldier to my own emptiness\\" really?  As the song picks up it begins sounding like something out of a quasi Madonna 1992 era cher fusion song.  I like Madonna and Cher, but this is OLD.  What happened to Gaga being creative?  This is no \\"Bad Romance\\"    2) Born this way- yawn...its ok.  but its not \\"amazing.\\"  It does sound like Madonna's Vogue....the electric carousel track in the background really kills it for me.  Its like \\"what is that horrid synth?\\"    3) government hooker... seriously what is she talking about?   The beginning sounds like a horrible version of Phantom of the Opera with a fake accent, totally out of place and doesn't flow with the music at all.  Is it a German version of her with aphasia?  Its not sexy (if that is what it was supposed to be?).   The lyrics?  Mindless drone music.  There is no passion here or creativity \\"as long as I'm your hooker just touch me, I can be good or bad.\\"  Blah blah blah.  (yawns incessantly).  It sounds like she is saying as long as I'm your hookah in several lines.  And what is a government hooker?  This makes no sense logically.    4) Judas- best song, the beginning sounds like Bad Romance.     5) Americano- highly offensive song.  I am not sure if others think so as well.  She starts off with stereotypes about Latin@s wearing \\"floral shorts,\\" and \\"singing in 8ths and barrio chords.\\"  Um, excuse me, not everyone does that who is Latin@.  If this doesn't bother anyone, the track will..it sounds like bad Mariachi music on acid in the background.  She has some weird lines in a bad version of Spanish.  Then she starts going \\"lalalalala\\" (oh wait couldn't she think of a line to put there?) then, if this wasn't bad enough she starts saying \\"I don't speak your Jesus Christ,\\" in Spanish.  Um...I think Lady Gaga needs ESL classes, not the people she is apparently signing about to bring their plight to the forefront..Jesus Christ is a proper noun... Now she just went out and offended the Latin@ community by also bashing their faith.  I'll pass on this horrid song and her stupidity.....The song is ear rape musically and in its insensitivity to Latin@s.    6) Hair- this song is weird.  It gets a lot of airplay, but don't be fooled..its lame.  It sounds like Kenny G got stuck in a washing machine and then gets abducted by Madonna and Cher.  The lyrics sound like something Rebecca Black would write.  \\"I am my hair...I've had enough this is my prayer I'll die living just as free as my hair.\\"  Oh please...    7)ScheiBe- this song is also strange and not interesting.  The lyrics (if you know anything about German) are also offensive.  Gaga attempts to speak in German, and the beginning sounds pretty cool until she starts saying \\"sh-t\\" repeatedly in German. She keeps saying \\"sh-t be mine\\" then later she states \\"I wish I could have fun without sh-t there.\\"   ???  So its ok if she uses a German word to personify men in a negative way?  How is this song good?  Even the music is all starting to sound the same on the cd by this point..    8) Bloody Mary- I dont think Jesus said \\"i'm going to dance with my hands above my head.\\" First weird lyric.  Second one is \\"I wont crucify the things you do.\\"  Ok Lady Gaga ESL lesson 2- crucify is a VERB you can't crucify actions you can only crucify a noun.  I guess her 10 year old fans though won't know the difference.  The lyrics really do not make a lot of sense.  It has a lot of religious imagery that makes no sense even if you understand religionor do not.  Say I ignore that, the music itself is weird..The background noise sounds like a frog, and the autotune and the end of the verses sounds as if the frog is being stepped on by a construction worker.  And what is with that \\"dumdumdum da da da\\" line...ok again Lady Gaga runs out of lines and just says random nonsense.    9) Bad Kids- this is like Michael Jackson on acid \\"I'm a loser baby baby\\" uh yeah..this song is not catchy....    10)Highway Unicorn- it starts good, like a Cher song being recontrived..you can dance to it. \\"run run run with her.\\"  ok are you saying \\"t-ts\\"?  I swear she is.  This is a listenable track, but not as good as her weakest number on The Fame.    11) Heavy Metal Lover- \\"I want your whisky mouth all over my down south.\\"  Um no.. I'll pass on that.  Again this cd is not for her 12 year old fans.  Beyond that though, really?  Is that all Lady Gaga can come up with is a trashy line.  The lyrics should be in a Rhianna song.  This song is overly autotuned.     12) Electric Chapel- the beginning riff is ripped off from another older song.  Its tolerable but not that catchy.    13) You and I- kind sad of a tune, it reminds me of her other work, but its not very good, should be tuned down to just her and the piano.    14) The Edge of Glory- ugh..she thinks mighty high of herself.  I don't think I like this song very much.  I'd rather listen to a remix of Celine Dion.  This song sounds like something Cher would do on a B side cd that was not released to the general public.

Many including myself, thought it was impossible to follow up their breakout rookie album with anything better, but I and almost everyone else were wrong! Robyn Pechnold is a true gem and a hardworking songwriter. The music is very chamber pop-folk driven and every song is driven by acoustic guitars instead of the occasional electric from their self-titled debut. The beautiful harmonies are nothing new to music or even their band but are delightfully refined. This album accomplishes more for the band than can be imagined and me for buying it. If this album were around for the Grammy Voting of last year for Album-of-the-Year, I dare say Arcade Fire wouldn't have stood a chance. And I'm a hug fan of Arcade Fire's too!
B004GYNPL2|3.0|This app is completely unnecessary. Everyone already has a superior app to this one. It's called, &quot;Your Brain.&quot; It's way more customizable.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Lots of fun but always dies after playing a short while on my verizon fascinate. Too bad as it is fun game
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Umm.. I don't know why alot of people are having these problems, but the game runs flawlessly on the Mytouch4g, so yeah. Its really fun and by far the only game for mobile to really have me consistently coming back for more. So, basically, GET THIS GAME!
B004IQMXD4|5.0|I ordered this product not knowing what to expect. I am happy to say that it is by far one of the best albums I have ever purchased. It is simply music at it's finest. It's great for those who are fans of Stevie Nicks, or even those who are not. You will fall in love!
B002OSY2T6|5.0|My daughter loved this toy... it kept her entertained more when she couldn't crawl yet because she loved the lights and music. She still plays with it sometimes (she is 8 months now).
B0054EHBWC|5.0|There are a lot of Akira versions out there, most of them are pretty expensive.    This \\"perfect edition\\" is the highest quality sound and video for the lowest price. If you want to skip all the fluff and pointless junk that is included with the 2 and 3 disc versions than just buy this single disc edition and get the best transfer of the movie itself at the lowest price. Some of the \\"special editions\\" that have been put out sell for $30 to $50 and most of the special features just were not worth the cost.    So, unless you need that special metal box edition, just buy this and save $20    I've bought or borrowed just about every version of Akira over the years and this is the only one I've bothered to keep, the rest I've given back or re sold because I didn't feel like they were worth the higher prices.
B00006I53S|4.0|I am an amateur and enjoy taking good photos. I bought this lens to go with my Canon 30D and I am happy with it. The combination allows me to take good low light photos which are crisp and well focused. Crisp is of course a relative term as at higher ISOs pictures get softer. The focusing is fast, quiet and accurate. In strong light the pictures are excellent. I find the zoom range very useful.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|best app in town, can also run off SD card. If u don't like this app, you need to try a few others and find u will be back to this one.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just the right amount of skill required for me.   I'm not very eye hand coordinated, but thinking can make up for it in this game. I enjoy the humor in this game.
B002FGU4DU|5.0|This is probably my 10th or 12th pair of sandals that I have purchased from Teva and I'm thoroughly satisfied once again. The last pair I had was one of the cheaper designs and I was not as happy. Glad I spent the extra money. I know that they are quality and will last me for the next couple of years. I have been buying Teva for twenty years and am a faithful customer and won't even consider another brand. I hope they never stop making them.
B002ZG983M|4.0|I caught this on netflix, and have to say I was taken by surprise.  I was expecting a kid's superhero movie, but this sure isn't that.  Sure, it's a bit campy, but that's what's going to make this a classic in a few years.  I'm not going to give too much away.  This is a violent action film, and it's all about Hit Girl.... watch and you'll see.<br /><br />And Kick Ass, well he does... in a final act of redemption.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Bought this whole album for 99 cents. Got my moneys worth. The album doesn't sit well with me really. It's just..blah. I'm still listening, trying to like it..but right now it's only gonna get two stars from me. Sorry Gaga.
0439023521|5.0|A friend of mine gave me this book to read on a camping trip, I wasn't sure I really wanted to read it because I've always read novels, nothing Sci-Fi, or vampires. But she offered and I took it. Once I started reading it I couldn't stop. When I put the book down, I couldn't wait to get back to it. I felt like I was there watching Katniss's life as she was living it. When I was done, I immediately went to the book store (couldn't wait for it to be shipped) and bought Catching Fire.......... Loved it!
0783227434|5.0|This has to be the greatest bruce cambell movie of all time! From all the one liners to all the slapstick humor.a def. See movie.
0439023491|5.0|This book only built up from the first and only got better, when I was done I immediately went out and Mockingjay.  I hope the movie lives up to the images that Suzanne painted in this perfectly crafted trilogy... LOVED IT!!!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Why buy the combined Ebook edition when you can get all three for nearly $9 less?<br />Someone wasn't thinking.<br />Great series.
0439023513|5.0|After reading the first two books of the Hunger Games, I couldn't wait to read the Last.... Mockingjay.  This is an amazing trilogy; the words come alive as images in my head. This is a story of a young girl struggling to keep her family together and alive the best way she knows how. She's thrown into a terrifying game of survival and gets blind sighted by love forced upon her, before she even knows what being in love is.  That's just the beginning. Katniss, The Mockingjay, I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|waiting for an update this is my fav game  and I want it to actually open instead of just opening and closing
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is really an amazing book. This is the kind of book where you find yourself reading certain sentences over and over again because the concept, idea or information just opens up your mind - incredibly. I have a huge family history of cancer- I am the only one in my immediate family to NOT have had cancer. I enjoy reading non-fiction science books and this was really outstanding. The author weaves the dense and incredibly complex information into a readable format that draws you in from the start. When I mentioned this book to several friends they all said it sounded \\"depressing\\" and were  not interested in reading the book. I have found that acquiring the knowledge presented in this book did not change my fear of cancer - it's still there - but understanding the biology of it all and not imagining it as a secretive, mysterious \\"plague\\" has helped me tremendously.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use it to remind me of several routines each day. Allows you to set up to 10 (pretty sire that's the correct amt)  different daily alarms with description labels. Can set alarms for different days of week, so I have work day alarms &amp; days off alarms. Has vacation key to stop all alarms. Many other features make this app very personalized to alarm needs.
B004GYNPL2|4.0|for all the people rating to app 1 star because they don't WANT a password keeper here's a tip... don't download it.   as for me I try to use a little human brainpower with my technology. if you've got the app and you're worried about passwords getting compromised don't put down your password. number your passwords and just make note which password is used with what account. example if my amazon password was &quot;youreanidiot&quot; and my email password was &quot;icantbelievehowretardedsomepeoplecanbe&quot; I would just REMEMBER the first password as, let's say, password 1 and the other one as password 2. then in the app I would write password one for my amazon account and password 2 for my email... I could then maybe, just maybe, do this for all my accounts and all my passwords, keeping them secure while remembering what password goes where. now that's just forbade people that think they should rate an app 1 star because it does what its supposed to.  as for the app itself, seems ok. is give it a 3 or 4 star review. making it a solid four bcause of he people that set off my rant there.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|Cars?  Check.  Cheesy 80's 3d effects?  Check.  Gratuitous violence and nudity?  Check.  Nic cage playing an anti-hero?  Check.      I'm not sure what people are expecting from a movie that's basically the modern equivalent of an 70's or 80's action flick (they were the same way with expendables).  If you grew up watching this stuff it basically will feel like home.
B004WJRJUE|5.0|I have been looking for this album to be re-released for a long time now and this version of \\"Under The Blade\\" is everything a S.M.F could want. I love the fact that Armoury Records are re-mastering and re-releasing all of Twisted Sister's back catalog. Hopfully new fans will realize that there is more to Twisted Sister than MTV hits like \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" and \\"I Wanna Rock\\". The sound of this album is very very RAW and unpolished as it was re-masterd after the original Secret Records version and not the US remixed verison that came out a couple years later. All of the songs on this album are awesome in my opinion, not one bad tune. Some of the heavier tunes like \\"Run for Your Life\\" \\"Sin After Sin\\" \\"Under The Blade\\" and \\"Destroyer\\" have a Judas Priest/Black Sabbath vibe to them and some of the more Rockin tunes like \\"Bad Boys Of Rock N' Roll\\" \\"Shoot'em Down\\" and \\"Day Of The Rocker\\" have a Alice Cooper,AC/DC sound. I would recomment this album to any 70's/80's Hard Rock fan or anybody that is wanting to discover Twisted Sister. Now if only Dee and the guys could get it together and record a brand new Twisted Sister album like \\"Under The Blade\\" in 2011 that would ROCK! Buy this album,support the artist \m/
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Thankfully it only took three days to beat the 50 adventure levels. otherwise my social life would've suffered. Fun game.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game is an easy five stars. My major problem is every time I get a call the game completely drops out making the game unplayable.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|purchased this heat sink in March to put in a budget build and i have not regretted it. the cooling is excellent! average temps are 27-33 degrees Celsius (idle-load). fan isn't very loud and the noise it does make is covered up by my speakers. some nice extras are included such as Cooler Master thermal compound and brackets to add a second 120mm fan but you wont need it unless you're overclocking. my only problems were with the instructions, i recommend just throwing 'em out and looking them up on Google instead. as other reviewers have stated make sure to measure before making your purchase (pretty big). if anyone is interested in putting this heat sink in a Cooler Master Gladiator 600 case rest assured that it will fit.
0811876373|5.0|I bought this book as a gift but now I'll buy one for myself.  It's amazing all the things you can do with just leftover of material after making a big cake.    The design its really good and easy to understand it gives you a lot of great ideas so you can start with your own creations.
031261246X|5.0|Zero Day is a vivid portrait of the fragile world we humans have built.  Good characterizations and factually accurate.   The book races along.  I couldn't put it down.  Compared to most bestsellers out there, this one is my top pick. Let's hope that there will be more books from these authors. Great work!
B00005K3O4|5.0|This movie is pure silly,corny,amusing. So ridiculous its funny. For a low budget movie they did an outstanding job on the clowns' makeup. Very creative.
B001FOR5XU|5.0|I had been put off reading this book because of the dreadful film with Will Smith.  Luckily I listened to a friend who convinced me that the book was even more of a betrayal of the book than most films are.<br /><br />I found this book truly gripping.  Written from Roberts point of view who, before the catastrophe struck, didn't know anything about vampires.  He examines the legends, he starts to research what caused it all to start and tries to find a cure.  He becomes a scientist. He wants to find out why/what it is they are what they are.<br /><br />He hates them, the creatures who took the world away. He wants them cured but if not, he wants them dead.  He is alone and almost going insane in his loneliness.  It is so tormenting you can almost taste his despair.<br /><br />*Spoiler ahead*<br /><br />Then he meets her and it rocks his whole world.  She makes him realise there is a totally different side to the whole story.  One he'd never considered.<br /><br />He is the enemy but not for the reason he thought. All they want is to live.  He is the killer.  He is the abnormality.<br /><br />A truly gripping read that makes you really think.
B000002VRZ|5.0|So I was in a restaurant on the interstate where they were playing the local New Country station-New Country is not music, it's product, like toothpaste or toilet paper, and Alpha Male New Country is the ugly bastard child of Lynerd Skynner and L.A. hair bands-so when I got back in my car, I popped in an Outlaws tape-it's an old car-so that I could listen to a real band and blow the crap out of my ears.  Thusly inspired, I bought this CD.  Of all the 'units' in the Guitar Army, the Allman Brothers, the Doobie Brothers, and the Outlaws were/are my favorites.  They wrote and played great songs, including love songs and lyrics with real feelings, and had a great sense of melody, composition, harmony, and all those other qualities that make for great music.  They were all fluent, well informed musicians who could draw from blues to classical and everything else inbetween to enrich their sound. Did I mention that I love loud screaming electric guitars?  The Outlaws could slash and burn with the best and they came off as nice guys and real musicians, not fools with socks stuffed in their tight jeans. Sometimes I miss the band, but I've still got the music.
0439023483|5.0|I love dystopian society books, and this is the best one I have EVER read.  The character are fully developed and you feel as if you have known them your whole life and therefore understand their motivations.  Katniss is the female lead character and her character literally burns into your memory.  The story and plot line is tight, and you can hardly put the book down it is so spell binding.    I don't want to give any spoilers, but I have recommended this book to everyone I know, and every ONE who has read it has loved it as much as I have.  Therefore, I think the story is appealing to a broad range of age groups and people.  I love that the main character (Katniss) is a strong female, willing to risk her life to save her younger sister.  Katniss is someone you can identify with, and you are cheering for, throughout the entire book.  I can't recommend this book enough!!
B004GYNPL2|5.0|Not sure why reviews here are so critical.  I like that it lets you make up your own types and has lots of icons.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Game always crashes or freezes with lots of Zombies on screen.  I have a new Verizon 4G Samsung Droid Charge.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My 10 year old niece was addicted to the desktop version of this tower-defense game and I decided to get it when it was offered for free by Amazon. It works flawlessly on my HTC Thunderbolt. Nice graphics, sound and addictive gameplay. I would not hesitate to pay the $1.50 they're asking for this game for hours of entertainment.
0307463745|5.0|REWORK caught me by surprise. I was privy to the audio book format and listened to it on a long flight where I found myself fighting the urge to sleep just so I could digest the wisdom within this book. Rework talks about some of the things that we are accustomed to do at our work places like using ASAP in emails, banning Facebook & Youtube, Time management, Hiring and provides a fresh new take on them. It is quite clear why 37Signals the company that the authors manage is doing incredibly well in this economy. Read this Book if its the only book you read this year. Highly Recommended!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is a lot of fun. I can play it for a while. the graphics aren't bad either. I got it for free but I feel that if you have to pay for it, its worth your money.
B002ZG974W|4.0|I liked this movie, thought it was interesting and cute, but I would have loved it with one change: more music.  There was no narration, which is not a problem in and of itself, but the movie was advertised with a fun modern song, and that's exactly what it could have used: some lighthearted catchy music or at least interesting music.  I could be wrong, but I think there were only two songs.  So I offer that up for warning to people who bore easily, and I offer up to people who gross out easily that there is, let's say, a diaper changing scene that might gross you out.  But if you don't bore or gross out too easily, see it!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is a very simple game that is perfect for a mobile device. I play games while waiting for things and my attention is divided. This game is perfect for that. Its engaging enough and entertaining. I'd put it on par with angry birds.
B004GCPJDQ|2.0|As others have mentioned, concept is great...and generally works well when the battery pack is held in, however my unit came with a battery pack that did not properly fit the mouse.  I've read other reviews that had this problem as well on other sites. With enough jigging, you could get it in so that the bluetooth connection worked, but at no point did it fit properly and would often pop out or create an annoying situation while utilizing the mouse as the bottom would be popped out a bit.  Perhaps my unit was an outlier as opposed to a universal design defect...but the cheap plastic molding/cut ruined the product and left me in frustration after 2 weeks of trying to make it work; I've opted to return (and I never return products).  Might try again to see if my unit just had a bad mold cut...but also noticed that 2 double AA batteries so far remain at 100% after a week of use.  Perhaps a rechargeable battery pack isn't all that necessary.
0316056863|5.0|I have been wanting to get this book for a little while now but did not want to pay $30. I am very pleased with the price and the quality of this book, it came just as it was described. I am only about 90 pages in the book but it has been a riot from page one! I highly suggest this book if you are looking for a funny leisure book!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The App works great on a stock HTC inspire, with no performance issues. The game is very addicting as well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is an amazing port of the full pc game. Runs perfect on the Droid Charge. Sure the size is a bit big but that's what the sd card is for. Just move the app to the sd card. Problem solved.
B00447G2MK|2.0|Such a whopping disappointment. I originally fell in love with these guys for their sincerity and ability to meld pop punk and metalcore together in a very catchy manner. This album, however, is utterly atrocious. Complete mainstream fodder made for Top 40 hits radio stations aimed at 13-16 year old girls. Not only is the music sub-par, with repetitive heavy songs and boring softer songs, but their sincerity is completely gone. Jeremy sounds like someone who's just too good for anyone who listens to the album. And last but not least, I will tell about the album's best part: It's Complicated. Why is it the best? Because it's a hilariously accurate summary of everything that now sucks about A Day To Remember. This song is basically poppy, radio-friendly rock (to hook in the heavy music-fearing kids) combined with a worthless breakdown (to satisfy the skinny jeans-wearing core kids). For all this bad, though, there remains a very little amount of good: Jeremy has become a much better singer and is becoming very solid in the studio, even if he does blow live. His harsh vocals, though, are terrible on the album. So, in conclusion, this album gets 1.5 stars for occasional glimpses of talent and a few nice hooks. Other than that, if you actually like music, avoid this album at all costs.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I chose this as a Vine request as a no-frills alternative to much more expensive cases intending to use it intermittently - maybe when going on campouts or biking. It works well and fits the iPhone 4 perfectly. In fact, I have left the case on the phone since receiving it.<br /><br /> The only thing I'm not enamored with is the styling on the back which against the black iPhone case shows up as somewhat stark increasing-sized circles centered on the Apple logo. I would have preferred plain / no pattern and the pictures with the product (which do clearly show the circles) don't show the extent to which this shows up. The protector for the front of the iPhone was easy to apply. To be honest I was expecting to remove it since another protector I got with a battery-containing case interfered with the appearance of the display, but this one does not.<br /><br />All in all a very satisfactory product for the price (currently under 9 bucks).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|...will love this cute &amp; quirky tower defense. Runs fabulous on the Galaxy Tab.  Welcome to the Android, PopCap. Cant wait for your other ports. :)
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I cried. Words cannot describe how much sorrow and pain this girl must have felt. I myself can`t even comprehend what that must have been like. Living each day not knowing the fate of you or your own family? If only she knew that she is and always be an inspiring legend. I am 13 and a girl, so I can see some of what she`s going through. I have a hard enough time with ups and downs not to mention the emotional rollercoaster. Imagine all that plus the constant fear? Anne Frank is an exellent writer and has an unexplainable way with words. Considering all this is from a young girl. Now this review may never be read, but I want everyone to know and understand what I mean. And I won`t critisize all the people would gave this book a negative vote. All I can say is, put yourself in her shoes. Already I feel very close to Anne even if we are both different. So here`s a tribute to Anne Frank written by a Kindle with the help of a box of tissues. A must read for everyone.
0425242099|4.0|I have waited forever for this book my biggest disappointment was Hawkes continuing to deny his feeling for Sienna. But all in all in was a wonderful book.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Not too sophisticated, but good fun. The game shakes things up by introducing new environments, zombies and plants, extending my interest.
1596434252|5.0|I have owned this for a few weeks now and my two year old almost knows the alphabet because of this book.
0345529057|5.0|If you like a suspenseful ongoing adventure this is the series for you! Usually once I read a book the movie is such a let down. But I must say the series on HBO lives up to this series of books so far. Perhaps because the author is also involved in the show. But the read was smoothe for me and I thoroughly enjoyed each book and anxiously await the last one!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|The summer of 2011 could easily be known as \\"The Summer of Heroes\\" (especially superheroes) with the likes of \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\" and \\"X-Men: First Class\\" gracing the silver screen. But before any of those heroes made their triumphant arrival in theaters, the summer was kicked off to the thunderous release of the box office hit, \\"Thor\\".    After an impulsive act of violence jeopardizes the sanctity of Asgard, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) is stripped of his power and banished, by his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), to Earth. There he encounters the lovely Jane Foster (Natalie Portman), and realizes that there is more to life than glorious battles alongside his fellow Asgardians. With Thor out of the way, his step-brother Loki puts into motion a plan that threatens to destroy all Thor holds dear in Asgard and on Earth. With time running out Thor must prove to be worthy of the power he wielded and once more command the fury of the storm.    Of all the comic book characters that Marvel has either already adapted for feature films or have announced plans to do so, Thor seemed the most audacious as he is hardly one of their most recognizable comic staples to the general public. Not to mention, the choice of Kenneth Branagh, an actor and director known for his Shakespearean background, didn't seem an ideal fit for bringing the mystical realm of Asgard to life on the big screen.    However, after viewing this outstanding summer blockbuster, I must say that Marvel's bold choices paid off brilliantly. Not only is Thor fast-becoming a household name, but Kenneth Branagh proved to be a truly inspired choice for director. No doubt thanks to his Shakespearean roots, Branagh successfully envisioned a nearly perfect blend of the fantastic elements of Asgard, with the realism (or hyperrealism) that has been established in Marvel Studios' previous film releases with which this movie is connected.    Written by the writing duo of Ashley Miller and Zack Stenz (\\"X-Men: FirstClass\\"), alongside Don Payne (\\"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\"), and based on a story from comic book and film scribe J. Michael Stracyznski (\\"Changeling\\") and Mark Protosevich (\\"I Am Legend\\"), the story for \\"Thor\\" is epic in scope (much larger than most first-attempt comic book adaptations ever dare), featuring incredible action, unforgettable characters, with plenty of drama, intensity, a budding romance, and even some comedy to boot.    Another apparent stroke of genius for this film was the casting, which was spot-on in nearly every instance. Leading the assemblage of characters is relative newcomer (to our shores anyway) Chris Hemsworth as the thunderer himself, Thor. Chris portrays Thor with such bravado, arrogance, and a seemingly unshakable desire for battle that exactly matches his early comic book days.    It is also worth mentioning that upon Thor's exile to Earth, Chris slowly brings out a softer side to the demoted god of thunder. Naturally conveying Thor's gradual embracing of humility and an understanding that violence isn't always the best solution.    With these two distinct sides to the character, we are left with a very well-rounded and believable hero of mythic proportions that feels much more real than I had ever expected.    Alongside, Thor is his step-brother Loki played to absolute perfection by Tom Hiddleston (\\"The Gathering Storm\\"). Loki has always been portrayed as a villainous character that went from harmless mischief to ultimately succumbing to his darker side due to his growing contempt for Thor.    In the film, Tom plays Loki as mischievous, but not completely evil (at least not yet). His actions though malicious in nature at times, are laced with an underlying desire for approval from those around him. In my opinion, this more deep-seeded emotional drive behind Loki's actions allowed for the character to be much more relatable and intriguing to the audience.    Rounding out the primary characters featured in this film is actress Natalie Portman (\\"Black Swan\\") as Jane Foster. Some have criticized Natalie's role as being merely the damsel-in-distress. Or that she portrayed the character as head-over-heels in love with a man she's barely just met, rather than a mature woman with an infatuation. Personally, I disagree on both counts.    I felt that Natalie's role was decently fleshed out, albeit not as much as some of the other main characters, but that's where a sequel can come in handy. After all, this was really Thor's movie, and it was pivotal to not only this film, but the impending \\"Avengers\\" that audiences really come to know and understand him (which seems obvious to me). So, in that regard, some side characters were left slightly short-handed in the story department, but I never felt she was there merely for the damsel role or to be just eye candy.    As for the relationship between Thor and Jane, I felt it was handled naturally as both characters showed they liked each other and that it was merely an infatuation at the moment. Neither played it anything beyond that, as some other critics have stated. As for how Jane acted around Thor; Natalie played her as clearly with a new crush, and it felt very believable. To see the relationship as anything else is reading too much into it at this point.    But I digress. I must mention that there is a plethora of supporting roles in this film, several of which merit a mention, but to do so for each of them would take quite some time. So, let me be succinct by saying that almost every single one of the supporting players delivers great performances.    Each of the supporting cast members brought something different to strengthen the creative process of moviemaking. Plus, in several instances some of them provided brief moments of much-needed levity to break up the intensity and drama unfolding within the story.    Those supporting cast members that are clearly worthy of mentioning due to their importance to the story and/or excellent work inthe film are: Kat Dennings (\\"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist\\") as Jane's college assistant Darcy (and a major source of the aforementioned levity), Ray Stevenson (\\"Punisher: War Zone\\") as Volstagg, a member of Asgard's esteemed Warriors Three, and Idris Elba (\\"The Losers\\") as Heimdall, guardian of the Bifrost Bridge.    Lastly, two pivotal roles in the film that don't receive a ton of screen time, yet were incredibly vital, are the roles of Odin and SHIELD agent Coulson, played by Sir Anthony Hopkins (\\"The Silence of the Lambs\\") and Clark Gregg (\\"Iron Man 2\\") respectively.    Sir Anthony Hopkins was the ideal choice to play Odin, Thor's father and Lord of Asgard. Anthony always elevates any project he's involved in due to his incredible acting prowess, his almost regal demeanor, and the respect that he clearly commands from those around him. For Odin, Anthony brought all of these qualities to bear, and crafted a performance that is worthy of the king of the god-like Asgardians.    Actor Clark Gregg, whose character Agent Coulson, has become a staple of Marvel's feature films, once again steals almost every scene in which he appears. Clark's portrayal of Coulson is so entertaining to watch because in one scene he will appear affable and potentially a push-over, but then he will establish himself as an authority figure with a quiet strength to back it up.    It is this dichotomy within Agent Coulson that has allowed this potentially one-dimensional character to have such staying power. Plus, he has grown, developed, and become even more interesting every time we meet him in these films.    Now, beyond having a terrific story, director and cast, the film also boasted some truly spectacular visual effects sequences. From Asgard's majestic golden spires to the subtly multi-colored Bifrost Bridge (or Rainbow Bridge as it is sometimes referred) to the menacing Frost Giants, every supernatural or fantastical aspect of this film was rendered with such detail and precisionthat it literally blew away all of my expectations. Every frame looked as if it had been pulled directly from the comic book into amazing reality.    This movie featured Hollywood movie magic at its finest, and the quality on display played a significant role in the believability of the film. Bravo to all involved in the creation of the picture-perfect imagery that blended seamlessly with the live actors and physical sets and backgrounds.    So, if you haven't figured it out by now, \\"Thor\\" is an incredibly entertaining blockbuster film and a terrific way to kick off the summer movie season. Even for those moviegoers that aren't aware of the particulars for this character, I believe there is still plenty for you to enjoy in this film. This movie is definitely a must-see.    \\"Thor\\" is rated PG-13 for violence.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|We left peak oil behind some years ago.  In a democratic state, where rationality and taking care for the next generations would prevail, we would radically chose for renewable energies.  But in the tyranny of corporations in which we live on a global scale, this is not even considered an option.  The power elite is very keen on the power they have and this power is related to their interests in fossil fuels.  So we'll continue exploring oil in the oceans, even if the ocean bottom in the Gulf of Mexico is cracked after the Deep Horizon explosion.  Although we were told the hole was stopped, from the cracks in the ocean bottom oil continues to spill into the water. And now that a huge amount of gas has been found in the soil of the US, well, this will be exploited too, even if you don't want to.  In 2005, the former CEO of Halliburton and then vice-president Cheney wrote the Energy Act.  The environmental laws were suspended in case of fractional gas drilling, a method which pushes 592 toxic products into the bottom, slowly releasing them into the ground water.  You think you still live in a \\"free\\" land?  Forget it.  If Halliburton wants to drill in your backyard, they will do it.  \\"It's the law !\\".  As a \\"reward\\", your \\"drinking\\" water will not only be intoxicated, it sometimes can be light on fire.  On top of that, you will fall ill, and the natural environment you knew will disappear.  A great number of deplorable situations are shown in the brilliant documentary.<br /><br />This gas exploration in the US looks like a cancer.  It is even invading cities like Forth Worth, which resembles nowadays more like an industrial estate than a city.  If they need to have a gas pipe through your front garden, well they'll do it.  Don't expect much in return.  They'll give you 10 bucks.  \\"It's the law !\\"<br /><br />We are living under a tyranny of big corporations who aren't willing to give up their power, and in the meantime will destroy everything in their decline.  When will we finally stand up, as a society?nd up, as a society?
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Regardless of your political views, there's something to be upset about in this documentary.<br /><br />This film is to the food industry what Inside Job is to financial institutions.  This documentary highlights the dangers of unregulated or underregulated businesses, how they are structured to act in the best interests of its shareholders, rather than its customers, and how government agencies are run by the same people who held (and ultimately return to) high-ranking positions in the same industry it is supposed to be regulating; like letting a fox guard the henhouse.  It's more than just poor working conditions and salaries for farmers and employees, poor living conditions for animals, and lax health and safety procedures.  It shows that many employees are exploited illegal immigrants that are actively recruited, hired, and brought from Latin America, only to be deported back with no legal repercussions for the corporations that brought them here, with full knowledge that they were not US citizens.<br /><br />It's another sad tale of how government is becoming increasingly controlled by private corporations that act only in the best interests of their shareholders; not the country at large, and how the apathy of so many have allowed it to happen.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|I had used Atkins about 10 yrs ago and have recently gone back to it with a vengeance, looking to trim up and lose about 10-12 pounds. The diet works but is much more difficult to stick to than the authors let on. This is especially true if you lead an active lifestyle, particularly during Induction.  I started with 30 net carbs per day based on my weight loss goal above.  Carbs are everywhere so it's hard to go to a wedding reception or barbecue and not eat them. Or, if you do control yourself, you sometimes look like the annoying low carb person.  This diet is a marathon, not a sprint, and requires a strong commitment. That being said, the Arkins diet does work, and I reccomend it, but in my humble opinion, it's a very demanding diet.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|I \\"purchased\\" this app through the Android Market a while ago. Prior to buying it, I did my homework and found this app to be the closest to what I needed in a password security app. Is it possible that there are other apps out there that other people will find more compatible with their individual needs? Sure.. ..why not? Does that mean that this app then deserves a 1 star rating? Not at all.<br /><br />I've been checking the daily free app offered by Amazon since they started this service and I've been reading the reviews that each daily free app gets from the general populous and I'm dismayed. Let's skip past the \\"balk at a free lunch\\" idiocy and move on to the \\"reasonable expectation\\" aspect. I see people giving 1 star reviews for all the wrong reasons. I really don't think people understand the purpose of a rating system. If you are scanning through the reviews, please be mindful of what is a genuine review of the app and what is drivel.<br /><br />I'm not going to turn this into a comprehensive study on how the many people are mindless so I'll just end with a simple statement on the quality of mSecure - Password Manager based experiences from someone that has actually used the program extensively.<br /><br />mSecure - Password Manager is an excellent application for helping you maintain all of your passwords and texts. I use it on my Asus Transformer and have had nothing but good experiences with it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a way to keep sensitive information secure and private.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I got these bad boys Thursday afternoon, after napping & missing my Fedex delivery.  The 4 hour wait (one day shipping, 12:30pm arrived, actually got it 5pm at Fedex store) was worth it.  Let's begin the review, though.    Comfort: The velvet and soft plush of the earcups are so great. It's like I'm not even wearing a headset. I've had irritating headphones, let alone headsets (previous headset was a PS3 Turtle Beach, dunno what brand, was like $79.99 and broke in 3 months due to wires blowing up). The comfort is well amazing, 5/5 easily.    Durability: Haven't had these long but they seem sturdy. That's all I can say really. I'm a careful person, especially with things I buy, so breaking these probably will not happen (jinx knock on wood). No rating right now.    Microphone Quality: The best headset I've EVER had in my online gaming experience. Previous microphone was a long, desktop microphone with decent quality - but picked up everything. This microphone won't even pick up a fan on max speed sitting like 10 inches away from me. People said I sound better, clearer, just way better than my other mic. 5/5 because of its insanely great quality.    Sound Quality: I bought Hercules speakers, for days I get bored, but when I plug it into the Hercules, the volume is extremely low. When I plug headset into the tower jacks, it is pretty loud, with medium bass. 4/5 for bass but this is mostly a gaming headset, I didn't expect it to be even this good for the price. 5/5 general sound though.    Miscellaneous: The two-inch or so cords that plug into the 3.5mm jacks are not as thick or strong as the length of the cable running down to meet the thinner ones. This is no problem; I rarely have any problems with handling my headset or getting angry, etc. Just something to look out for.    In addition, I bought a 5.1 Channel Surround Sound USB Sound Card which is having delivery problems. This should pump up my headset's sound quality 10x. I'll edit this (if I can) and give it a more proper review with that addition.    All in all: You get a BANG for your buck. This is top of the line. Microphone is extremely clear. Pro headset.    IMO: 5/5 total, no doubt. Worth every penny, $28 with shipping. Beat that.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Sanderson is now one of my favorite authors.  Such imaginative ways of using magic and making it completely believable, allowing the reader to suspend their skepticisms regarding magic... it's all possible - until you're done with the book.
020161622X|1.0|You can put this book into the category of books like - 'Teach yourself programming in 21 days', '20 recipes to success'. The books which don't have anything in them and just trying to<br />seek attention. This book doesn't have a strong foundation and grabs all these universal, common sense tips and bunches them together.<br /><br />I would not recommend buying this book to anyone.

0385341679|3.0|This one took me on a huge roller coaster ride. I am not quite sure how I feel about this last installment. The writing itself as always, through this series was on point. (I have to admit though, there were times during reading this one, that I asked myself does Ms. Moning know what she's doing or where she wants to go?). Mac, Barrons, V'lane, everyone, u got to see the many layers get pulled back to reveal yet another complex view of what makes them tick & why. What's important to them. What's in their heart. This one wasn't as clear to me as the other 4 books. There were times I was just flat out flabber gasted, confused about where things \\"appeared\\" to be going concerning the story, the people we love or love to hate, and ultimately the ending.<br /><br />I feel like concerning so many things with this book, the journey that we take with Mac and the \\"reveal\\" with many things could have been done much better than what they were. Although the explanation of why you are led to believe certain things for a time did appease me a bit, but ultimately I just wish another avenue was taken in regards to this. There were alot of things layed to rest here that I feel were kinda anticlimatic, considering the build up and the suspense leading into this final chapter. But @ the same time I can see why it was done this way.<br /><br />Yet there were things that fell into place beautifully as well. Ms. Rowena, Alina (Mac's sister), Mac getting those final answers of who she is & the why of all the confusion. Barrons, who and what he is. FINALLY! And the unexpected gift Mac figures out how to give to him in the end. The one thing that has kept Barrons driven through out this entire series. & of course the question of will they or won't they finally quit butting heads & surrender 2 each other already!<br /><br />I liked how things are revealed and settled with Mac and her parents as well. I just wish that there could have been more closure concerning Mac & Dani. I really liked this little girl. And certain things that came to light concerning her broke my heart.<br /><br />All in all I would have to say if this last book has left me so conflicted about how things happened and were rectified, I always say if an author is able to evoke such emotion from me concerning a book or series then they have done their job.. I would highly recommend this read & that u please start from the beginning of this series. U won't be sorry.rtain things that came to light concerning her broke my heart.

B0011UF79C|4.0|I liked this movie.  It showed how one can prevail through a world designed of genetic perfections.  Ethan did have some help along the way, but his determination and almost obsession conquered the odds.  Sure some of the acting was a little stiff at times, but the story line required it.  Look at the people who strive for perfection in our world today.  Don't they seem a little strange and different from so called normal human behavior? We have those in our society now who try to get certain DNA donors with high potentials of being a superior human child in their families.<br /><br />In Ethan's world, perfection was the norm and others were outcast. Sort of the have and have nots society.  Sounds like our world with the prejudice that presents itself. Ethan just wanted a chance, which he got, though sacrificing alot along the way.  Uma did okay for her part and Jude Law was great as a spoiled cripple living his dream in Ethan.<br /><br />This movie is great for a viewing.  Enjoy.

B00506V2GA|5.0|In school he was known as a world class jock.  He started his professional life as a sketch comic, went on to comic acting and is now famous internationally as the misanthropic House in the dramatic show of that name.   No one should be surprised that Hugh Laurie's also an amazing musician (okay, he showed flashes of this in all of his television series) and a talented, devoted singer of New Orleans style blues.   So despite the track record of actors who decide to make albums, this one is worth your time.    The album starts out with a virtuoso piano solo leading into the haunting standard \\"St. James Infirmary\\", and it goes on to feature a wealth of blues treasures from the familiar (\\"Swanee River\\", \\"Battle of Jericho\\") to the more obscure (\\"Six Cold Feet\\" and the title track).  Mr. Laurie is backed by a handful of quality New Orleans musical veterans and you'll also see several legendary names who've lent a hand: Allen Toussaint did horn arrangements on several tracks; and Irma Thomas, Sir Tom Jones and the one and only Doctor John each have featured vocals on a song with Mr. Laurie accompanying and provided back-up vocals.      If you're a fan of Robert Johnson, Jelly Roll Morton and Professor Longhair, you'll enjoy the fresh takes on their songs found here.  And if you're a fan of Mr. Laurie, you'll see once again that this man can do whatever he sets his mind to.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|it is very fun and a good game to play while you're bored or waiting for something or someone. this game had amazing sound effects, awesome and cool plants and zombies, and very addicting. MUST GET NO MATTER WHAT!!!!!!!!!!! p.s. you suck if you don't get it.
B001KYJA6K|5.0|As stated by another reviewer, purists will balk at this release. Those expecting an Historically Informed Performance (HIP) will be shocked. However, if you get past the initial shock, you will realize there is much to love about this disc. If you want Monteverdi played \\"straight\\" HIP, there are hundreds of discs available. Pluhar, however, gives a modern spin on these works, as if they had been written in the 20th century. Pieces are modified with jazzy or latin rhythms or odd percussion, and yet, everything is done tastefully and just sounds right. \\"Pur ti miro\\", taken from the opera \\"L'incoronazione di Poppea\\", as sung by Jaroussky and Rial, is an absolute delight. \\"Amor\\", sung by Rial, is a deeply affecting lament. I am not usually big on Monteverdi, but this CD grabbed me from the first note and didn't let go. Try the sound bites now !
158270208X|5.0|Book does a good job of getting you in a thankful frame of mind.  It then gives you an opportunity to recall all thinks you are thankful for in your life and it finally lets you list things you want in life with an expectation you will receive it and alrady being thankful for it-as if you already received it.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|the game has &quot;lost&quot; my progress 3 times now. ive done nothing special, i just open it up and voila, all my progress is gone. its really getting annoying.
B004EPYZOO|5.0|I love it! My husband & I both enjoyed it, glad I bought it. Watched it once & then again the next day. Reminds me some of Ghost Rider with a Quentin Tarentino and Robert Rodriguez twist. Have read a bunch of reviews mentioning Nic Cage's bad dead pan acting & bad hair . . . that's just him, either you like him or you don't. I like his acting in this, similar to Gone in 60 seconds & Ghost Rider and let's face it Nic Cage is not a pretty boy and his hair will never be pretty either. But I like him playing the good guy badass  :0) thoroughly enjoyed it!
B0046B8GEQ|2.0|Despicable me is not a terrible movie or anything, but most of the movie seems like cheap slapstick moments. Nothing really keeps any of the scenes together to find it really funny, or really interesting. Great for distracting little kids, but that is about it.
014241493X|5.0|I somehow managed to get halfway through this book before I realized it was written in the present tense. I hate present tense but the way it was handled by J.G. was completely undistracting. The characters were well developed and the prose was beautiful. I did have 2 tiny issues. I felt like it peaked too early. The most intense moments of the book were in the first half of the novel and the climax of the story was in fact anti-climactic. I will say that the last half of the book is much funnier than the first half and that the entirety of part three had me bursting out laughing. And two, I felt that instead of letting the reader think, ponder, and discover their own metaphors, the author explained most of them, in fact over explained them.<br /><br />All in all, one of the best books I've read in years.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|My kids have long since played this game for X-box, so when I saw this as free daily download, I had to get it, and I'm so glad I did. This has got to be the cutest game ever, and how often does a phone-based game grab you and make you stare at tiny sunflowers, finger poised to grab up the sun, begging, \\"Oh, please, hurry hurry hurry\\" because you need just ONE MORE to get the plant you need? It's instantly addictive and works very smoothly on my htc EVO. Braaaaaaainssss!!!!!

B000KBELZE|4.0|As an Instant Video:Prime Eligible:Reality TV selection, Amazon is visionary in making Jane Eyre available to a wider Victorian-Era Reality TV audience.    No modern era Reality TV comes even close to Victorian-Era Reality TV for its grittiness and in-your-face class-warfare themes.  Ali Fedotowsky, Teresa Giudice, Richard Hatch, and Bunky have minor problems in life versus Ms. Erye's true life-and-death struggles and search for true love.
089898890X|5.0|Is a really good book. If you like to develop your jazz thecnic, this book and the \\"Jazz and Syncopation\\" of \\"Ted Reed\\" are the best way. I Recommend it to beginers, intermediated, and advanced; is valid to every levels.
B000VUFJ4Q|5.0|I actually bought this album after Fearless and Speak Now, and until I had it in my hands I had never heard all the songs, but I was very impressed with it. This is definitely the \\"country-est\\" album Taylor has released, and in my opinion it's a wonderful first album. The lyrics and music are filled with Taylor's feelings and stories, and the music and beats are really pleasant to hear. There are no fillers in this album. Now, about the Deluxe Edition that's quite expensive to get these days....  it is definitely worth the extra money! The lenticular cover is absolutely beautiful, and Taylor's first conversation with Tim McGraw is cool and funny to hear, they're both very funny. The DVD is very nice, too. There are images and videos that I bet you have never seen before, and Taylor is very humble and smart, it's very nice to listen to her talking. I say buy the Deluxe Edition if you have the chance, and don't be scared of the high price, it's an awesome purchase.

B002G1YPH0|3.0|Compared to the H50 water block this might cool better (I've compared both and it seems to, by about 2 degrees under duress).  I had to remove this because of the size, it was bumping up against my RAM.  I have a full size HAF X case, P8P67 PRO board and 4 Patriot Sector 5 2133 DDR3 2GB RAM sticks.    The setup is pretty bad, it has an X brace to secure the heat sink to the CPU, but actually getting it firmly seated against the CPU without smudging the thermal paste is pretty ridiculous.  I don't think I'm being unfair, this compared to installing the H50 water block is night and day.    I'm one that overclocks, removes parts and reinstalls on a regular basis to get the most performance out of my components and this is definitely not the CPU cooler to get.  If you have patience and are looking at a good cooler to install once and never remove again, perhaps with two to three DIMMS with space from this behemoth cooler, then this might not be a bad purchase for you.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|the game is solid. no force closing and fun to play. I got it when it was free but feel it is still worth the $1.49 price. The only downfall is the lack of 3g/4g dl. you have to have access to a WiFi connection.
0446343129|5.0|This book was written many years ago but the information that it provides is still valid. Sugar is still causing sickness to many millions of people. The author starts with the history of sugar and its health and economical consequences on many nations and societies. The author cites many medical references about the sugar consumption and the health recovery that many people experienced when they eliminated this sugar addiction from their diet. This book was for me very interesting to read.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|I came to Gaga's defense when people compared the single Born This Way to Madonna.  I thought it had an early 90s vibe, and a positive message, but I did not think she was blatantly copying Madonna.  Until now.  This album is full of religious lyrics, sax solos, female empowerment messages, etc.  It's all VERY Madonna from twenty years ago.  I understand that all artists today are influenced by Madonna, but I'm honestly a little shocked at how much of Madonna Gaga has put into this album.  That being said, I like Madonna's music from twenty years ago, and I like most of the songs on this album.<br />I love The Fame & Fame Monster.  My only real complaints about this album, and Gaga in general right now, are that she used to do things that were new and different, but this album doesn't seem fresh, and it feels like she is TRYING TOO HARD to be different.  But it's not different.  An Italian American Catholic girl writing vague lyrics about religion (and yes the lyrics are vague and don't make much sense--she shouldn't have to tweet and write on facebook and explain herself in interviews about what her songs mean--it's almost as bad as when she said the Meat Dress was somehow related to gay rights--a long shot--but I'm sure it makes sense in Gaga's head)...not original.<br />She's just trying too hard to make art, trying too hard to be different.  It all comes off as rather pretentious and annoying.<br />I love Edge of Glory...I love Americano...Born This Way...the song where she speaks German...Bloody Mary is even good.  Those are my favorite.  I need to give the other tracks a few more listens.  I'm just disappointed because I was expecting something fresh and new from Gaga but this album feels tired.  When you are trying super hard to be different and artistic, this is what you get.<br />It's ironic, because I feel like the same thing happened to Madonna...becoming pretentious and all of that...when Gaga gives us tears and acts like she still feels like a \\"loser\\" it all seems fake to me, because 90% of the time she seems like she has a very high opinion of herself.  I bet she will start speaking with a fake English accent soon.<br />All of the above aside, this album is still much better than 95% of the pop junk out there, and I do like it but I expect more from Gaga.t all seems fake to me, because 90% of the time she seems like she has a very high opinion of herself.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|On my Droid X, whenever a calendar event pops up during game play I lose my game progress.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love the game. Much better than Angry Birds.  My only complaint is that the game resets your sun collection to 50 regardless of how many you had in the previous level.  I never get to play the more expensive weapons.  By the time I have enough money, the level is over.  *sigh*
B000KUD2G4|2.0|this device seems to create hum rather than eliminate it. With Behringer products, its hit or miss.If they work, they are great value - but this is one that doesn't do its job.
B002RI9ZPY|3.0|This one took a while. It dragged in several places where it got all political and I do think it suffered from having Lisbeth in hospital for most of the book. I certainly didn't get the 'can't put it down' feeling (which I did with the other two books) until the last 100 pages.<br /><br />Oh yes, and there is the detail! Larsson loved detail and I think, to a non-Swede, it can mean very little and get confusing.<br /><br />Still, glad I read it, and the trilogy as a whole.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|This is an extremely well-crafted movie.  Aaron Sorkin paints pictures with his words, and David Fincher makes nearly every scene a verse of poetry.  The actors each bring a measured amount of understated sophistication to their roles.  While Jesse Eisenberg deservedly got a lot of attention as the fictional version of Mark Zuckerberg (he and Sorkin explain this at length in the commentaries), each \\"role player\\" crushed their parts in different ways.  From Andrew Garfield to Justin Timberlake, from Rashida Jones to Rooney Mara, and even Joe Mazzello (\\"The Pacific\\" as well as being the little boy in \\"Jurassic Park\\"), the performances were pitch-perfect.    On Blu-Ray, the colors and editing shine even more brightly and allow deeper appreciation.  Both commentaries (one with cast, one with Fincher & Sorkin) are both worth watching as well.  The Sorkin/Fincher one gets a little dry and detail-drowning at times, but anyone who appreciates filmmaking will appreciate the discussion of the trade.  There is also a discussion of the whole \\"playing an actual person\\" aspect of Eisenberg as Zuckerberg.  I think this goes a long way to simply file away the argument of how \\"accurate\\" the movie is.  They truly strive to portray Mark Zuckerberg as simply a character, rather than it being a completely factual documentary.  Whether or not you are into the Facebook scene (or really care that much about the celebrity of Zuckerberg, this movie will likely provoke multiple viewings.

One glaring omission is that several recipes call for a good quality vegetable stock and I wish he included one in the book it makes no sense that he did not.  I know how to make a stock but I am interested in how he makes it and what ingredients YO uses.  I still think it is a stellar book, the accompanying photographs add to the deliciousness.

B002UXRGM0|5.0|Shot entirely in HD over four years, \\"Life\\" is a must have for a blu-ray collection. Since I have a large collection of DVDs, I've been selective in the blu-rays I purchase. Usually, I only purchase films that I consider to be classics (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Full Metal Jacket, etc.) I understand none of those were shot in HD, but I've seen some that were. \\"Life\\" simply blows anything you've seen in HD away. I'm glad I strayed away from just sticking to classics. The expedition crews were able to capture footage never before seen. You will be amazed at what they were able to get on film with the super high-speed cameras. The cover shows a 'Jesus Christ' lizard running on water, and while that's an amazing sequence, it's only one of several standout segments in \\"Life.\\" The humpback whale heat run and oak woodland timelapse segments come to mind as well.<br />David Attenborough is perfect throughout too. I'd advise against the Oprah version and stick with the original. You'll be amazed at this blu-ray set and will learn something as well. \\"Life\\" took four years to make and it shows in the quality of this set. It was four years well spent by the expedition crews. This is a new classic that I will enjoy watching again and again.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I loved this film.  I was in love with it the moment the opening song ripped open my eardrums, and put inside them glory.  I've seen this film 7 times now, having watched in in theatres and on demand multiple times.  This, however, was better than the rest.  The blu-ray had all the little odds and ends a seventh viewing needed.  I recommend this to all who love game and nerd references in general, as well as music. XXXXX out of 5 XXXXX
0553582038|1.0|Absolutely loved the first three books. I was so excited that there was such a fresh approach to the fantasy genre. Just enough magic, complex character creation. Wonderful!    Oh, I forgot, then came a feast for crows. UGGH! It was Martins own self indulgence by killing off main characters that he was forced to have to create new irrelevant and BORING fill in characters that no one cares about. In this book, Martin goes on and on with pedantic details (it reminds me of Robert Jordan and dare I say a little of Terry Brooks at times). Is anyone else absolutely sick of Cersei? Somehow she is now the major character for the whole series but is essentially a bitter and hateful shrew (more so than ever before!). Too bad she didn't choke on some food with Joffrey.     I grew so weary of his angry women issues in this book. No one is hopeful in this book. Everyone seems gray, dull, and tedious. I thought I was simply growing tired of the series a third of the way through. Put down the book, read a few other different authors and series for awhile and went back to it. OMG! I must be a masochist to have thought it would get any better. Everyone in the book was still bitter, whiny, self doubting, shrill, etc.    I have no earthly idea how the HBO series will be able to handle this book; maybe they can just edit it out! I don't know if I want to venture reading Dance of Dragons knowing there are still several more years to go before any final conclusions will occur in the last installment. Fans aren't getting any younger here!    I hope Mr. Martins enjoys his new found fame and large budget HBO series that showcases his actual good work of past, but he will need to get some editors for the next books if he wants to keep his fans around. As for me, I'll be hanging with Brent Weeks and his wetboys.

B000T05R90|2.0|This might have been something different and new in 1967, but as of 2011 it has not aged well.  I do understand why some people might like this album, but for a young person in the current millennium, there are much better choices for your time and money.    New fans of Pink Floyd would expect to hear what's on Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, Animals, and The Wall.  Newer fans might also consider giving a try to A Momentary Lapse of Reason, The Division Bell, and perhaps Meddle.  I recommend all of those albums (yes, the Gilmour-era music - AMLOR and TDB - are not as consistent as the others and the lyrics leave something to be desired, but IMO are still better than earlier works to newer ears)    For the rest of the albums, I'd definitely recommend giving them a listen before purchase since they might not be your cup of tea...  The Final Cut is a particular train wreck talked up by fanboys who readily admit that the actual musical content is lacking (it's basically an emo poetry reading) - Piper at the Gates of Dawn is at least better than that mess and I understand why people would like Piper.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Wow.  This was one of the most satisfying reads I've enjoyed in, oh, forever - in any genre.  As another reviewer has said, the balance between action, suspense, humour, romance, smokin' sex, etc, is just right, and the author's deft handling of plot, pace and character development is simply transporting.  I could not put this book down, and read long into the night with my eyes burning and my heart racing.  Dragos was a most convincing dragon - an imperfect yet mouthwatering blend of feral and human traits.  Pia was simply delightful, and ah, thank heavens - at last a strong three-dimensional heroine with plenty of juicy baggage yet hardly a self-pitying whine in sight.  I cannot recommend this book highly enough for any lover of paranormal romance, and have already pre-ordered the next instalment in the series.
B0001KZM3O|1.0|How to create \\"The Final Cut\\":  1) Start with \\"The Wall\\"  2) Remove all of the actual songs, so all that remains is the filler ambiance  3) Add the magic ingredient of Roger Waters' enormous ego and armies of his cult followers proclaiming that this is something wonderful  4) Viola!  You've now got \\"The Final Cut\\"    This album is pretentious in the same fashion as a blank canvas called \\"modern art\\"...    I expected actual great music from Pink Floyd based on all the positive reviews, not an emo poetry reading...    This album has more in common with William Shatner's spoken-word efforts than Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, or Wish You Were Here.  This is the steepest musical cliff that any band has fallen off that I am aware of.  To go from \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\", \\"Hey You\\", and \\"Run Like Hell\\" immediately into this steaming pile of trash boggles the mind...    I've purchased hundreds of CDs and this is one of the worst music purchases that I've ever made.  I'm still upset about this album decades later.  There is more redeeming musical content in modern corporate trash pop than there is in \\"The Final Paycheck\\" for Roger Waters...    Don't waste your money on this utter garbage.

B000002J6H|4.0|Where did Amazon get this guy McNett to review the music of Stephen Stills?  He obviously does not have a clue of this music or the history of Rock & Roll.  Steve Still was song for song on par with Neil Young during their Buffalo Springfield days and in CS&N he was head and guitar more accomplished in every way than David or Graham.  CS&N was a group that was certainly greater that any individual but it is the work of Stills that has stood out as the best they had to offer.

B0035G5IOE|5.0|To be sure, anyone expecting Wes Anderson's interpretation of \\"Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" to be a faithful retelling of the classic by Roald Dahl may not find what they're looking for.  Instead, what the viewer will find is Wes Anderson being Wes Anderson -- only animated.  It is not necessarily a children's film -- in fact, my kids bored of it quickly -- as much of the dialogue and nuances are more adult in nature.  However, for adults who grew up reading Roald's books and who enjoy the almost vintage quality of Anderson's films will genuinely enjoy it.  The stop-action animation quaint and adds to the whimsy of the story.  Wes has also included many of the same actors that make up the filmmaker's quirky library including [[ASIN:B0007UC8Y4 The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou: The Criterion Collection]] and Jason Schwartzman [[ASIN:6305428239 Rushmore]], as well as Owen Wilson [[ASIN:B001EOQCL2 Bottle Rocket: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]] and Adrian Brody [[ASIN:B003KGBIS4 The Darjeeling Limited: The Criterion Collection [Blu-ray]]].     As a fan of Wes Anderson already, this film is definitely one of my favorites.  However, if you're not necessarily a fan of his previous work, you're looking for something more family-friendly, or you generally shy away from book to film interpretations, this movie may not be for you.  But, if you're looking for something a little quirky and unusual and have a fondness for stop-action film, then you might want to check this out.
B004IFYMWK|5.0|This film deals with the Valerie Plame scandal during the early Iraq war years. Cheney/Rove had exposed an undercover CIA agent in the press, in mean-spirited revenge for her husband's public challenge to the Bush lies about the Iraq wmd program. A bag-carrier of the VP took the fall guy role and was sentenced to jail.<br />If this were not a 'true' story, its subject could be defined as: how much risk do we need to take to fight for truth and against abuse of power? Is truth in the public sphere worth damaging our personal life?<br />As this film is a rather literal transposal of 'real' events into a story on the screen, the question becomes another one: why is a president who fabricated a pretext in order to drag his country and indirectly much of the world into a war of aggression, not being prosecuted for his criminal acts while in office?  and why do the one-star-reviewers, who take the film for its political face value, not comment on the truth question? is it irrelevant to them?<br />There are moments when I almost regret that the good old times of the W presidency are over: nobody to make fun of any more. This film serves the useful purpose of reminding me of the criminal truth of the W years.

B001PPGAJE|5.0|Professor X :\\"Mutation, it is the key to our evolution. It has allowed us to evolve from a single organism into the dominant species of the planet. This is process is slow, normally taking hundred of years but with a few millenniums, evolution leaps forward!\\"    In what I think is one of the best adaptation from comics, X-Men 1 and 2 deserves to be the winners. Bryan Singer and his team managed to turn this comic series into modern day \\"reality\\".    I won't go into the movie details but if you think about it. Mutation may just happen in the near future or very soon. Imagine being prejudiced against because you can move metal/things, read minds, transformed into anyone, blast off a mountain with just your eyes etc. When it does happen, what would you do:    1. Join Magneto and wipe out the human race as what Ian McKellen's character said \\"We are the future, not them Charles?\\" OR  2. Join Professor X and learn to earn their trust and show them we're are humans too as what Patrick Stewart's character said \\"If no one is to oppose them (i.e. Magneto and gang), humanity days would be over.\\"    The storyline is close to the heart, what if you are gay, a jew, a minority race that is considered \\"not normal\\" in the eyes of everyone else...    This movie does great along those lines. Great action is useless without great storyline. X-men 1 and 2 hits bull's eye!    P.S. Give X-Men 3 a miss please, it was pure fluff and utter rubbish with only great CGI and poor storyline. I blame 20th Century Fox for not willing to wait for Bryan Singer and gang to come back with a powerhouse story for X3.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|Intro:    I'm a long time fan of the Marvel comic franchise, specifically where Wolverine is concerned, and I am delighted to give X-Men: First Class a dignified rating. Although the movie title denotes the origins of the team, as published in the recent comic series beginning in the second half of the 2000 decade, the movie is not based entirely on the X-Men: First Class comics. The characters portrayed in the movie, for example, are loosely based on other sub-stories. Angel Salvatore (portrayed by the lovely Zoe Kravitz) was created in 2004 (Marvel's \\"New X-Men\\"), and therefore is not an original character. Another character, Darwin (role-played by Edi Gathegi), is out of place when his first appearance is in 2006 (In the \\"Deadly Genesis\\" series). The decision to involve these characters in an origin story is curious, especially when Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr are relatively still young. Onto the film...    Synopsis:    The first half of the film delivers a magnificent back story (reasonable to comic fans) which eventually ties Xavier, Magneto, and the other characters seamlessly together. The movie opens with a familiar scene that we were privy to in Bryan Singer's \\"X-Men\\" in 2000. As Erik Lehnsherr is separated from his mother in a Nazi concentration camp, his adolescent magnetic powers are revealed. The ensuing scene with Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) and the Lehnsherr boy is not only well-acted, but gravitates an emotional pull on a realistic level that is absent from any other Marvel film. This scene leads to Lehnsherr's ascension to Magneto. Director Matthew Vaughn somehow reproduced this scene flawlessly.     Meanwhile, a young Xavier and Raven (Mystique) meet during a break-in; Raven is homeless and is scrounging for food when she is busted by young X. The two, however, develop a close kinship, and Raven is adopted into the Xavier family. Years later, adult Xavier (James McAvoy) is aspiring to become a professor and delivers a thesis on genetic mutation which captures the attention of Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne), a CIA operative who, while undercover, previously discovered a plot between Sebastian Shaw and USA Colonel Hendry (Glenn Morshower) to advocate the placement of nuclear missiles in Turkey. This eventual set up is brilliantly staged to create the \\"real-life\\" Cold War. Xavier, able to read MacTaggert's mind and thoughts, realizes the urgency with which to intervene.    In doing so, Xavier and Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) are introduced to CIA Division X led by The Man in Black (Oliver Platt). This stages the first attempt with humans and mutants teaming up against rival mutant/human relations. Erik Lensherr (Michael Fassbender), hell bent on revenge, attempts to intercept Shaw and his Hellfire Club mutants, Emma Frost (January Jones) aka White Queen, Azazel, and Riptide before they can escape the CIA aided by Xavier. Xavier saves Lehnsherr and the two begin a formidable friendship, although neither see the future of mankind coexisting with mutants in the same light. This is ultimately the cause of their eventual, and inevitable, division.     Sebastian Shaw's (K. Bacon) role is basically manipulating humans into destroying themselves to the benefit of mutant-kind (WW2 and Cold War). (His true goal, however, is world domination ala comics). He leads the Hellfire Club which is an international society of wealthy elites, with an illusory Inner Circle of mutants who seek to influence world affairs to favor their own agenda. Having discovered the CIA recruiting their own band of mutants (Division X / pre-X-men) to bring him down, Shaw pays a nasty retribution. Meanwhile, Xavier and Lehnsherr investigate Shaw's plan to pit the world powers, USA against Russia.         I leave the rest of the movie to your discretion, but I do want to mention that a later scene between Shaw and Lehnsherr is absolutely captivating. The ascension of Erik Lehnsherr -to- Magneto is complete!     My Opinion:    This is the best X-Menmovie thus far. It surpasses the original trilogy in acting, plot, writing, fun, action, and will earn applauds and approval from fellow marvel aficionados. Director Matthew Vaughn reshapes the dynamic world of mutants and powerfully executes a movie worth the title and our ticket money (Matinee price, lol). It also serves as a catalyst to rebooting the X-Men franchise because honestly, I wasn't sold on Singer's first two, and Ratner's mockery of a third. I will give Singer credit, however, in that HE was the one to begin the Marvel Madness in 2000. X-Men 2 was the best of the trilogy, but this prequel has so much more force, power, and emotion that the others lacked. I didn't feel like I was watching a movie. It felt more like a documentary of the events that led up to the Cuban missile crisis. Neither character looked like they were reading from a script. McAvoy and Fassbender embraced their roles and make me believe they were Xavier and Lehnsherr (Magneto) respectively. One of my favorite scenes was when Xavier and Lehnsherr approach Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) in a pub to initially recruit him to their team. Wolvie's expression was classic, and expressed my sentiments about the previous films including that gawd-awful Origin story about himself.      The CGI effects were near-flawless and the integration of JFK clips helped make the film standout. I did not agree with adding characters Angel Salvatore and Darwin, as they are lame and weak replacements for Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman (or others they could have used), but I also understand that Vaughn was trying to tie the trilogy together with this installment. Even so, it still doesn't make sense because the White Queen is but a teenager in the Wolverine origin movie (Wolverine losing his memory after being shot in the head by an adamantium bullet, LOL PUH-LEASE!). And Magneto...ok let me clear my mind: Ian McKellen IS NOT, I repeat, IS NOT, and NEVER was a good fit for Magneto. HE WAS TOO BLOODY OLD and WEAK!! I mean, c'mon, he plays Gandalf, an OLD wizard for crying out loud!      The tone of the movie is much darker, parallel to that of the Dark Knight. Although there is hardly a drop of blood, there is more violence. The director is able to realize this violence without shedding blood, and I think that is a top-notch achievement. There is no end-of-credits scene which is a first. Bummer! I was entertained every minute of the movie, and I'm usually a harsh critic, specifically to comic characters whom Hollywood has a knack for ruining. The question is, will they reboot the X-Men franchise? I hope so, but please allow Hugh Jackman, Famke Jansen, and James Marsden to reprise their roles.    5/5    **Green Lantern is going to FAIL hardcore, mark my words**

0060558121|1.0|If you go up and read the description to this book, \\"much more than he appears\\" is probably a better description than you'll get inside the book itself of what Wednesday actually is.<br /><br />The book is filled with \\"And then something happened\\" \\"What was that?\\" \\"It was the background\\" and you have to pick one of the infinite numbers of things that could have happened.<br /><br />What gets me about people who read this guy's books, is that they all think he writes awesome stories, but if you sit them down and say \\"Ok, what happened in the scene with the spider?\\" you'd probably get a thousand different responses, and none of them would be wrong, because Gaiman didn't actually explain what happened, how they traveled, why, where, what, how they got there. You can draw with crayons and make things up with more detail.<br /><br />Now, aside from that, his grammar, ability to describe random items that mean nothing (Cigarette box, nipple), is actually interesting. Unlike other fiction writers, he only spends a paragraph or 2 doing that, whereas I'm used to having to read 2 pages. I suppose if Mr. Gaiman could describe anything regarding the storyline, he'd probably be one of my favorite authors.<br /><br />Definitely a great writer, but I'm capable of lateral thinking, and if you're capable of thinking, this book is going to be very confusing. This is like reading one of those questions where the right answer is \\"Not enough information.\\" To everything. If you've read the book, you know what I'm talking about. If you don't know what I'm talking about, your brain filled in something that wasn't actually in the book.

B000FCKGPC|4.0|This seems to me a problem, perhaps the main problem with the saga so far: it's so long.  To justify its length the details have to be interesting, and this is done in two ways: vivid characters and surprising but fitting twists of plot; but that means complexity.  Complexity requires hard work for the understanding and the memory, for which work naturally there must be some reward: why take all the trouble to keep all these events and characters straight in your mind?  Unless of course you love them and love the story as a whole, but what you love should be worthy of that love: else it must fail and fade.  There's only one element in a good book to justify love for its characters and plot, in fiction especially, where these are not real: what can that justification be but the book's theme?  Theme determines the conclusion because it's the necessary end to both characters and plot, their destination.  How many otherwise good books fail because they have a bad ending; or worse, they have no ending at all?  Isn't this the danger the saga now after four books runs?  Will the fifth book provide the obligatory happy or at least satisfactory ending?  Will patience be rewarded?  After so promising a beginning and so long, not to say tedious, a middle, will we at the end be able to say, That was well done!  Four stars then I say, with the fifth in abeyance.
B002RKSXJG|5.0|Author: Wilkie Collins  Title: The Woman in White    Description (source): Who is the mysterious woman in white who appears to the drawing instructor late one night? From whom is she fleeing? How is she connected with the woman the drawing instructor loves but cannot marry? And above all, what is up with the mysterious Count Fosco?    Review source: This was a free kindle book because it's in the public domain.  Plot: The book was a little difficult to get started in, but once the woman in white appears, only a few pages in, things start to move quickly. There are some fairly unbelievable coincidences, but that's what makes fiction fun.    Characters: The book is narrated by Walter Hartright, a drawing instructor. He and the \\"good guys\\" (his students Laura and Marion) are pretty tame, but I loved the villains, especially Count Fosco, who keeps mice and songbirds.    Writing style: Collins has been compared with Dickens, so definitely 19th-century diction--we would call it wordy, maybe, if it were published today. I did find myself getting impatient with it a few times, but mostly the plot really kept the down arrow pushing (modern equivalent of pages turning).    Audience: People who aren't afraid of the classics. Collins shares with Poe the title of being one of the first authors of detective fiction, and while this isn't exactly within the mystery genre (more like gothic), there is an element of detection in it.    Wrap-up: This was a long book, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and couldn't stand to put it down for long. I would definitely recommend it, especially if you haven't yet discovered Wilkie Collins. 4.5/5*

B002QW7ALM|4.0|I was expecting this to be very similar to Event Horizon, which got me to watch it but not necessarily to be excited about it.  I actually ended up liking it quite a bit, although I was a bit dismayed that I recognized most of the scenes I liked best from Eden Log, a low-budget French sci-fi/horror flick from 2007.  This movie is better than Eden Log in some ways (I remember feeling like that one was high on style and not so much on sense), but I couldn't help but feel like I was watching a straight-up remake at some points.    The first half hour or so here is most reminiscent of the game Dead Space -- so much so that I wondered if the producers were just setting up a video game tie-in.  Ben Foster sets out to find out what's going on in the crippled ship while Dennis Quaid stays behind and provides Otacon-like technical support over a comm link that conveniently cuts in and out as the plot requires.   Thankfully, things become less game-like after a while, and both Foster and Quaid get to do some interesting stuff.  There are some decent scares and action scenes as well as genuinely interesting environments, and overall I was happy with the script, the direction, and the acting.      Bottom line: it's not a sci-fi classic, but it's worth watching.  I'd rank it maybe a notch below Aliens and several above Alien 3.    Also, check out Eden Log.

B00000DATR|5.0|This music took me closer to Heaven than any in recent memory..or distant memory, for that matter. So what if it reworks earlier themes? So did the classics. This deserve 10 stars
B004GYNPL2|5.0|It is very hard to get me to rate anything with 5 stars.  The customer service I received today is what put this over the too.  I tried this out and found there were some things that annoyed me - specifically that the app did not default to the number pad when entering credit card numbers.  I sent a quick email to their support, and within an hour on a Saturday evening, I got an email explaining how to edit the app to my liking.  This sort of fast service (and an answer that didn't make me feel stupid) is what will make me a loyal customer.    As for the app itself, it is a very easy interface, highly intuitive, and Very Easy to customize for your own taste.  I'm glad I picked this up.
0143039431|5.0|I still remember elements of the Joad story long after having finished reading this; their story really is an American story.  Steinbeck's ability to capture an enduring spirit in a sprawling family novel is a profound experience.
B004I9TQLI|5.0|WOW!!  Amazing.  Great movie about the concentrations camps told through the innocent eyes of an 8 year old boy.  I highly recommend this movie....one of the most moving, well acted movies I've seen in a long time!
B004LWZW42|5.0|My expectations of this film were relatively low. After all, X-Men 1 & 2 were gold-standard films.<br /><br />However, this may be the best X-Men film to date and it is certainly the best superhero movie since the Dark Knight Returns was released a few years ago.<br /><br />The script was well-written, thought-provoking and always on-point. The pacing and editing aspects of the film were flawless.<br /><br />And, most importantly, the acting was unbelievable. Michael Fassbender's turn as Magneto was among the best acting jobs I have seen in the last two years (and I have watched over 300 feature-length films in that time span).<br /><br />Kudos to Kevin Bacon as well. Initially, I thought Bacon would be a poor choice for the role of the primary villian, Sebastian Shaw of the Hellfire Club. I was wrong. Bacon takes on the role with an uncanny mixture of poise and glee that reminded me of why he was a star.<br /><br />But, what impressed me most was that this film was more compelling than any other X-Men films even though most of the characters are lesser known. People are pre-disposed to like X-Men movies that competently feature known-commodities such as Wolverine, Cyclops and Phoenix. (Many viewers grew up with these characters.) But a movie that features long-since forgotten characters such as Banshee, Mystique and Havoc? Very tough to pull off, but Bryan Singer, Matthew Vaughn and company did it.<br /><br />My only disappointment regarding this film is how it was marketed. Marvel spent so much energy pushing its first feature film of the season, Thor, that there didn't seem to be enough spotlight left for this film. It's a shame, because this film is substantially better than Thor was.<br /><br />Excelsior,<br /><br /> Anti-Charisma
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Defending my home, and brains, against zombies is SO much fun it's kind of addicting.  It's also pretty challenging as you try to pick the right tools for the job.  I never played an earlier version of this game so this version is excellent, to me. The sound effects and music are good too. I got it when it was free I think it's worth the $1.50. Even $3 isn't a terrible deal.  Thunderbolt

B00371V91S|5.0|Around us are people who make a different.  Now there's a book that explains why.  A top read.
B004SBQAN8|1.0|This movie was incredibly bad. I have so many complaints about it! First of I will start with the one positive thing, the actress who plays number four's girfriend is exactly how the book describes her, good-looking. But the problem is ther are at least 100 parts where something is completely incorrect compared to the book and I'm low bowling. Here are some examples:<br />1. Four is on a boat when he gets his third scar, during the day, and he does not react to it nor does in glow.<br />2.henri has a slight French sounding accent.<br />3. Four's \\"lumen\\" gives him the ability not to feel intense heat.<br />4. He meets Sarah in the hallway while she is taking pictures<br />5. Sarah knows him because her mom is the real estate agent who met them at their new house when they move in<br />6. Sam is sup post to wear Nasa t-shirts<br />7. Sam reads a magazine that mentions the mogadorians and that is why henri goes the those dude's houses<br />8. After the holloween PARADE with the football team in it and Sam sees four's powers four sneaks into his house to get the magazine and Sam pulls a pistol on him<br />9. Henri dies during the big battle and is killed by a beast<br />10. Bernie Kosar the dog grows scales when he transforms to fight the large monster<br />11. And 6 is not fire proof that is four<br /><br />Sorry I did not exactly go in order and I just mentioned 11 problems 'cause I would have wasted you time. And to the director and all those people who thought it was great well READ THE BOOK and maybe you will find the problems with this. This movie is a huge waste of time and if you want the real story, well then, read the book instead.
B004W5T2RG|4.0|I was REALLY hesitant to watch this movie because I'm not a Paltrow fan in the least.  But she was pretty good as well as McGraw.  All in all, the movie is worth watching and you won't be thinking why am I watching this disaster.  This movie made me ask myself once again, why would anyone want to be famous??
0788815490|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie from the very start.  It turned into a convoluted tale of class separation and deceit, which destroyed the love of two people.  First off, I love London.  It was wonderful being transported back into the era of 1910, where hats were just as outrageous as they are today on the heads of English ladies. The second half of the movie was set in Venice, and the scenery and flavor of the location was delicious.  Everyone vies for money, and each person is pawn in a game to get what they want.  The acting was suburb, the story somewhat predictable, and the ending that leaves you thinking long after the credits are done rolling.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|Loved it.. Very catchy music ..Cher's voice is one of the strongest voices I've ever heard and Christina's as well
0525951652|2.0|I love Ken Follett. Pillars of the Earth still ranks among my all-time favorite books. So I found myself surprised at how much I didn't like this novel. The story is rambling and, for the most part, uninteresting. It became such a chore to read that by the halfway point, I gave up. And this is going to be a trilogy, so we probably won't see another Follett book for some time except for the two sequels. Very disappointing. I have never disliked a Follett book before this one. I would recommend Night Over Water, Pillars, and the Pillars sequel, World Without End. Pass on this book.
B004XUDAH8|3.0|This is good music for ambient background listening for doing things like writing papers or organizing files. This album is not for pumping out pop tunes for mass consumption. This may upset listeners depending on what they are expecting.

B003IY47JK|4.0|Lucidity is Dutch symphonic rock band Delain's debut album, that brings a wonderful, emotional new sound to the genre, powerful by the fabulous, unique vocals of Charlotte Wessels and the former keyboardist of Within Temptation (and brother of WT founder/guitarist Robert Westerholt), Martijn Westholt. Originally founded to be a studio project heavy with guest musicians, Delain's Lucidity album proved so popular that fans called for live shows, so Delain transformed into a touring act and, on their second album, April Rain, their sound changed accordingly. This has led to an interesting (and unexpected) difference between the two albums, particularly in the overall sound.    Lucidity has a darker, grittier feel, with less musically complex songs (that just seem much cleaner than some of the over-produced stuff on April Rain) that have more emotion behind them. Though Charlotte's voice isn't as polished here as on April Rain, she still sounds amazing, and the numerous guest appearances from some of the biggest names on the European metal scene really pumped with album with awesome. Some of the guests include Sharon den Adel (Within Temptation), Marco Hietala (Nightwish), Liv Kristine (Leaves Eyes) and George Oosthoek.    The undisputed stand-out song here is \\"The Gathering\\" (I've never seen the movie, but I'm pretty sure the entire song is just a Highlander reference), which marries of voices of Charlotte Wessels, Marco Hietala and Guus Eikens in a epic and catchy tune that will make you want to pump your fists in the air and jump. I also really enjoyed \\"Sever,\\" with its excellent orchestral sections, \\"Daylight Lucidity's\\" fresh and melodic approach.    Vocally, \\"Sleepwalker's Dream\\" really shows off Charlotte's abilities and strength, and showcases her as a versatile singer who can sing operatic-style parts, as well as rock ones. But if you're looking for a song that will really stick with you purely based on the vocals, I'd go for \\"Silhouette of a Dancer.\\" While I know there are bands out there who really specialize in beauty and the beast style vocals, I really think that this song is the best I've ever heard this type of vocal work done, between Charlotte's innocent, almost girlishly high vocals and George Oosthoek's deep growls, I think Delain really found the heart of what this type of vocal work is about.    Now, I can't talk about this album without mentioning Sharon den Adel's surprising vocal performance on \\"No Compliance\\" (the U.S. version of Lucidity includes a version of this song with Charlotte performing the vocal), Liv Kristine's haunting vocals on \\"A Day for Ghosts\\" and \\"See Me in Shadow\\" which will send chills down your spine.     What surprises me the most about this album is that I tend to enjoy it more than April Rain, even though it's the bands first album. It's hard to explain why, but Lucidity is darker, heavier, more emotional, more personal and just feels like it has more heart than April Rain. Lucidity also just seems cleaner to me, as some songs on April Rain seem over-produced, and it just seems to have a higher quality of guitar work and the epic metal sound.     If you've listened to April Rain, I'd definitely recommend Lucidity -and if you thought April Rain was too light for your tastes, you may want to check out Lucidity, you might be surprised.
1400031567|5.0|After reading Stieg Larson's Millenium series I was stuck hoping for a lawsuit to sort out when the next book was going to rock my world from Sweden. Then along came Henning Mankell and Detective Wallander. The series is top notch story telling. Simple, beautiful and absolutely engaging. Have been reading these in order and love them. Also, have checked out the BBC series and have been impressed with the showa. A+ !
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Really cool DVD.  Awesome graphics.  Many places I never knew existed, creatures, too.  Something good to throw on, because let's face it, the movies lately blow.
B003L77FYS|5.0|\\"You need to be honest with yourself as to why you are doing this,\\" Richard Castle's mother advises and worriedly expresses to her son in \\"Knockdown\\" an earlier Castle season three episode.  Indeed, while following Detective Kate Beckett, on the trail of her mother's murderer, Rick places himself, in mortal danger...constantly.  Why?   And then Rick confesses to his mother and....himself:  \\"It's not about the books anymore.\\" His love for Kate is engraved on his face.  Throughout season one and two the storyline establishes a lovers' dance between Kate and Rick, with the roguish playboy's attempts at befuddling, wooing and softening the troubled, complex and annoyed Beckett. With wit and a sense of the ridiculous, Rick brings fun to Kate's life and makes her feel.  But so much more happens.  The man who gets by on his charm and \\"not a little talent\\" transforms himself along the way because of Kate's integrity and tenacity.  Season three had its charms, and I truly hated to see it end. Now I eagerly await the video and the start of a new season.  All of the characters are so strong, and the chemistry between the two leads is so palpable, the viewer is ensnared into this world.  It is amazing the power of fiction, of this television show to enthrall and involve, so much so that the faithful audience constantly roots for Kate and Rick to recognize the love they share...the heartbreaking love everyone else sees.      In \\"Knockdown\\" Kate tells Rick to go home.  She tells him, \\"It is not his fight.\\"  She begs the question, \\"Why do you keep coming back?\\"  And the answer is written all over his face as Rick, the writer struggles to find the words, his voice, to tell her, and then breaks off with a joking repartee about being the plucky sidekick.  He settles for the partner role when she informs him that the plucky ones get killed.  At the end of \\"Knockdown\\" she thanks him for having her back and saving her life, for standing up, and Rick responds with one word:  \\"Always!\\"\\"Knockdown\\" has its counterpart in the season three finale...\\"Knockout.\\"  In a face -off with Rick, Kate asks him how he feels about her.  Still he cannot say all the right words, but he knows they have kissed and have almost died in each other's arms and have never talked about it.  He rattles her.  And she makes an amazing comment:  \\"Being with you is like hanging around with the funniest kid in the school.  And it is not enough.\\"  Stricken, more aware than ever, Rick cannot convince Kate to stand down; the word quit is not in her vocabulary, even if her life is in the balance.  Captain Montgomery tells her that she gives the dead a voice, but she does not owe the dead her life.  At the funeral Kate voices the captain's words when she says that sometimes, if we are lucky, we find the person who will stand with us.  Then Kate looks at Rick, and in that frozen moment she understands love:  love's actions, love's steadfastness and love's power.  It is etched in Rick's face and reflected in hers.      Finally, in the last scene, the writer finds the words... his voice.... his words of love.    ..........continued ....September 2, 2011  It has been three months since my Castle season three review (above), and two years since I first reviewed season one.  No doubt I love the show, Kate and Rick, but I've come to some new revelations regarding Kate's comment on her \\"hanging around with the school's funniest kid, and it is not enough.\\"  Her attack has always disturbed me. What more does she want? What is not enough? And I consider:  What do you do when everything is not enough?      In Countdown Rick holds Kate dearly, protecting her as they both nearly freeze to death in each other's arms; later he defuses the bomb, saving the city from destruction. This man is no longer the immature playboy or \\"nine year old on a sugar rush.\\"  And Kate knows this as she watches Rick's every move with pride and love. Still she will not share any private time with him to decompress aftera shattering day; she allows Rick to walk away, dejected and clearly alone while she embraces Josh.      Rick has saved her life in countless battles, going through every door with her as her partner, usually unarmed.  She turns to Rick, always.  He welcomes her into his home with generous, open arms.  To the ex -cop Raglan, she identifies Rick as someone she trusts.  Where are the other men in her life? Faithfully, Rick measures up and lifts her sinking spirits with supporting words, with a joke, anything to ease her troubled mind and soul. He listens to her pour out her heart's desire, often clumsily, for surely she is aware that he loves her.  Everyone has told her so.  In sync with him in all areas, she knows her heart would break without him near.   No price is too dear for Rick to pay as he loyally watches over her safety.  He cannot stop himself from giving her gifts of love and thoughtfulness...her father's watch,and the Temptation Lane, signed, cast picture, knowing that these gifts connect to her childhood. When Kate reminds him that he cannot stay out of her personal life after he gifts her with a memorial to her mother, Rick's face crumbles until she thanks him.  Of course he cannot stay out of her life; he wants to be a part of it.  Rick is a happy soul who often says \\"until tomorrow,\\" because that adieu is more hopeful.  He lifts her heart and soul and she knows it.  She has said that she believes in Richard Castle. He is enough.   In the finale Kate tells Rick they are over, but the captain enlists Rick to help him save Kate's life.  Lovingly, Rick over-powers and holds a grief -stricken Kate, away from the battle which leaves her captain dying.  In this poignant scene, Rick tenderly consoles Kate, stroking her hair, touching her face, holding her back, while telling her how sorry he is.  She cries out his name and strokes his face; does she comprehend? When she looks at Rick as she eulogizes the captain, she seems at peace with Rick's love.  But isit enough, now?   I truly love, respect and support Kate, and these words are hard to say.  But right now she is not enough.  For so many reasons, she clings safely to a man she does not love, afraid to be with someone real. I didn't think I could ever say this because Kate is a strong dose of reality, and Rick, well, Rick is magic.      As for the next season, Season 4,  I realize Castle cannot continue on the same note we have all come to love, given all of the changes taking place on the show, and many of us will be concerned for our favorite lovers, wanting so desperately for them to be together.    But in truth, every character needs to progress and grow. Surely new obstacles will provide conflict and tension, challenging the entire cast.  Indeed, Rick must deal with Kate's fears, Alexis' concern, his own guilt, a new captain's disregard and perhaps the case papers Capt. Montgomery mailed in the finale.  Kate must come to know herself better, work to heal herself, and recover from her physical and psychological wounds, both recent and deeply lodged.   If she sees competition for Rick's attention or someone else in her place, she will have to share more of herself, let others in, and fight for Rick's love.  She has taken him for granted; she wants him boxed into the small space she allows...on her terms.  But Rick is too real (a role reversal for sure) and demands more. Rick now knows (for his everything is not enough), that to win Kate, to gain her love, to hold her, as he so wants to do, he must first let her go.  PS...the Castle lover in me must say:  Let her go, Rick, but just a little bit, for we love her, too.  ...continued September 28, 2011...\\"RISE,\\" RENEW, RECONCILE AND REDEEM...MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR NOW     Rick and Kate's dilemma still comes back to what do you do when everything is not enough.  In 3x24 \\"Knockout,\\" Kate tells Rick that hanging around with the school's funniest kid is not enough.  But thankfully that equation has changed in the new season; amidst the uncertainty, hope and love prevail.    Poignantly titled \\"Rise,\\" the Castle Season 4 premier is imbued with renewed promise, reconciliation and a chance for redemption as Kate and Rick struggle to find a new dynamic, a new relationship between them, granted, not built on total honesty, but always built on love.   I can understand why Kate does not admit to hearing Rick's profession of his need and love for her. Acknowledging it at this time would change everything between them and possibly jeopardize their chances with each other, especially their friendship which she has always needed.    Momentarily dazed near her, Rick lies to Kate when he tells her why he is staring at her, saying that he didn't think he would see her again.  He stares at her because he is overwhelmed with his love for her. Apparently he and Alexis have a running dialogue about Rick's \\"tell\\" which indicates he is lying or bluffing at poker; his nose twitches.  The camera certainly zeroes in on Rick's nose twitch as he speaks, standing at the foot of Kate's bed.  With the many close ups of this man available, I have never seen this.    Next, seated by Kate's side, nervous before her, Rick is ready to own his words and to tell her again of his feelings and his love for her, until she tells him she doesn't remember anything and that some things are best not remembered.  It is heartbreaking to see Rick's sad eyes, his swallowing, his hesitancy, his dejection, the rejection.  Seeing him cut off, adrift, is painful to watch.   Yes, Kate needed space, but he needed her.  Cut off from her for three months, Rick needed contact with her to heal from the horror and trauma of her near death.  Later, in the book-signing/swing-set scene, everything she says is pointed, sub-text, revealing her love for him.  She is trying.  Rick is a forgiving person, in love.  Studying his face, Kate wills him to get it. And he does.   With the echoes of \\"Knockout\\" still in my mind, I think of the last time Rick tried to tell Kate to walk away, that she wasn't fine, and then...their breakup.  Now, once again, his emotions, his hope, his love play upon his face, along with the trepidation that she will not listen.  He must convince her to redirect herself and save herself from the edge of destruction, and from those who would kill her, knowing that shelving her mother's case, even for a while, denies their love a chance to thrive.  Thus Rick's eyes search her face; his voice, hushed, and sometimes breaking, tells of his passion, of his desperation to make her understand. She is so fragile and stressed, he fears to hurt her further. With hope, and awareness, Rick asks her \\"to give it time; they will figure it out together...just not today.\\"  Adding to Rick's heartfelt entreaty, and unbeknownst to him, is Kate's truth:  she did hear him pray for her life, plead for her to stay with him, proclaim his need for her and profess his love for her. Perhaps it is her secret knowledge of the depth of his love that grants her the peace, the honesty to listen to him and to acquiesce.    He promises her his help and a solution. Responding to her fear that she will not know who she is if she doesn't find an answer immediately, Rick gives her an incredible gift with his words:  \\"You are who you always were.\\"  And so in tune with her, Rick states what she needs to hear.  Kate still \\"honors the victims\\" with compassion and solace as she has always done.  She can get her bearings by \\"not letting them rob her of her life.\\"    Not their usual way of talking, this is evident in this interaction, the most powerful scene of all, even considering the other emotionally-charged exchanges. For Rick has her survival riding on her accepting his guidance and not blasting him out of the water.  Far more than any words, Kate's acceptance of Rick's advice speaks volumes to her trust in him, her need for him and for healing.    This time she listens to him.   Consequently Rick is able to redirect the chaosin Kate's soul, saving her sanity and selflessly delaying his chances with her, getting her involved with another case and supporting her through a stand-off with a killer, thus confirming his own role as partner and equal.   Later Rick asks Kate for her thoughts on the day, and she says, \\"It's not enough.  But it is enough for now.\\"  It is a start.  Smiling, Rick reminds Kate that the \\"wall inside won't be there forever.\\" Significantly, as Kate turns and walks away, somewhat uplifted, Rick's face reveals his turmoil.  He is playing all sides against the middle, fearing the outcome, the loss.  Right or wrong, Rick is deathly afraid with Kate's life in the balance; he will bear the pain and the fall-out because he can not bear to \\"lose her again.\\"  At home Rick must address his daughter's reprimand that he grow up.  Taking responsibility for the situation, Rick tells Alexis he must be there for Kate.  The voice of his conscience, Alexis asks her dad two crucial questions:  \\"Does she make you happy?\\"  \\"Yes, she does.\\" Rick replies.   \\"Is it enough?\\" Alexis asks.  \\"It is enough for now.\\"     And so it is.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|This is a very good CPU. It will trans code video files much faster than other processors. The embedded graphics are used in an H67 or Z68 motherboard that has video outputs. The embedded graphics will play most games with no problems on highest settings. There is no need to buy a graphics card if you are not an extreme gamer.    The only thing I wasn't impressed with is the booting time with this processor. I didn't see much difference with this processor and 8bg ram vs a 2.7ghz Core 2 Duo with 4gb ram. Maybe it's because I was using a 7200rpm drive but for a newer and faster processor, I would expect it to do everything faster.
1401323952|4.0|I love her commentaries in all her books. They are entertaining and informative, and makes you feel a friend is talking with you. Makes you want to cook!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Fun game. Much more addictive than I anticipated it would be. This is the first platform I've played this game on, my HTC evo 4G that is. Only issue I've had is the little animation when you get a new plant is slow and pixelated. And it obviously eats up battery, but thats to be expected. Very fun, have recommended it to several people.
B003UESJH4|5.0|this is a great movie. i love the story and the actors are great. this is a great movie, and a good historic film. Colin Firth and geoffrey rush are great. this movie is awesome, a good drama. one  of the best films i've seen this year. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B004LZRSBY|5.0|Excellent DVD that caught us by surprise.  Very good concert and a better look into the elusive (USA) group A-HA
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Expecting the typical PNR plotline, I was pleasantly surprised and really had a blast reading this one. Gone is the expected H/h-must-overcome-the-misunderstanding/obstabcle-and-fall-in-love storyline. Though some have described the character's behavior as inconsistent, I have to disagree. They seemed more realistic that the usual \\"Always sullen Hero\\" and \\"Always timid heroine\\". She's moody but not obnoxious. He's obnoxious, but not abrasive. Everyone speaks their mind(s) and that is such a relief. Great fun, great dialogue, spanking HOT romance and a great new world of supernatural beings. Cannot WAIT for the next one in the series!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's about time. Plants vs. Zombies is simply addictive. Thanks to POP Cap for finally bringing it to Android. Brains.
B004RC8NUQ|3.0|can it be done..a no-strings relationship?? absolutely but this shows the, perhaps, flexibility of both sides .... the film would have been better without the suddenly and usual today reversal of \\"typical\\" character-roles in no-strings relationships ... why was he so surprised at the no-strings attitude???    Ashton Kutcher was not, however, very believable .. a bit kitschy and  Natalie Portman's performance was trying too hard to retain the distance ... A no-strings relationship is OK and the film was OK.
0345529057|5.0|Excellent reading, Books are quite long and I wish I had ordered the hard cover for perhaps the print would have been larger.  I am thrilled HOBO is making a mini series of it.  Im looking eagerly waiting  for the next release.  Loved this saga.
0756982596|5.0|I bought this book for my Grandson. I have it at the Pre-School that I work at,  and the children just Love it. The adventure of the baby Llama and the rhyming   of the words hold their attention.  It's Great for the younger age group.   You'll be very Happy with this Book.
B0025KVLV0|5.0|I have most of the Beatles songs and John Lennon songs, but I wanted \\"Across the Universe\\" so I got this one.  It's my favorite.  The sound of the songs on this CD are clear and simple.  They went back to the original Beatles sound with this one.  I Love it!!!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great game when it works. I am sure they will keep working on thiss fun game. i have it on my iphone too.
0142418471|5.0|Let me start by saying this book is not funny. Funny makes your laugh like a normal human being. No. This book is HILARIOUS. It's the kind of funny that makes you laugh so hard that nearby people give you concerned looks and you can totally understand why. I'm ashamed to admit I almost stopped reading this book around page 50. It's not my usual cup-o-tea. But thank the heavenly angels I kept reading because man, oh, man was it great. This is one of those books that makes you want to spurt cliches like, \\"I kept thinking about it long after it was over.\\" I loved how the two Will Graysons eventually crossed paths. And needless to say, I'll spend the rest of my life searching for a real-life Tiny Cooper. The only thing that bothered me was the frequent notes of depression, but I'll admit it added depth to the story. Overall, this was a hilarious and thought-provoking book and I'm sure-as-heck glad I gave it a go!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Everyone knows what the game is about, so I won't waste time there, but the port to Android is unbelievably buggy on both my and my wife's Samsung Continuums - constants freezes, crashes out of the game, or even random rebooting of the phone are commonplace.  Sometimes I get 5-6 levels, no problem, other times I can't even finish 1 level without pulling the battery!  I'm still waiting for more updates to address these issues, but since Popcap is printing money with this for the platforms it does work on, I'm not holding my breath.  My recommendation - if it works on your phone, great, enjoy!  If not, uninstall it ASAP, because it's not worth the constant frustration.
B004V9J21O|4.0|After eight years Neal returns to where it started for him after breaking away from Spock's Beard.  He continues his spiritual journey and delivers 'Testimony 2'.  Thoroughly enjoyable and enough of a difference here to spark anyone's interest.  And as I've maintained with Neal, he just blows away anything out there in contemporary Christian music today because who else out there is delivering a seventy eight minute concept cd these days in the Christian market?  I'll answer that straight away - \\"No One!\\" But, unless you're not listening to prog you've probably not heard of him.  I've introduced Neal's music to a lot of people over the years because they just don't know who he is.  He's off the radar, but the best music out there isn't coming from the radio or from the big record labels.  It's coming from independent artists such as Neal who can mold the music to their way and no one elses.  The opening tracks are fantastic and he reconnects with Spock's Beard in the song 'Time Changer'.  While there really isn't anything earth shattering here, you just know what to expect when you pick up a cd from Neal.  Great music overall.  While some will say it's redundant to his other epic concept cd's which might be true in some regards, it's still an excellent cd.  Listen to the words and music and you will be moved.  And as is usually the case Neal always throws in those bonus tracks which are always a nice treat.
B004A8ZWT2|5.0|Overall, this is a really a fun movie that it set with great visual backgrounds.  Check it out and enjoy the twist at the end of the film.  Can't say much more...
0812550706|4.0|I really liked this book.  I was ashamed of myself for not having read it yet, since I'm such a fan of scifi books.  It came highly recommended from essentially everyone I knew.  It was really good and the story was compelling, easy to read.  Almost too easy.  The writing is extremely straight forward.<br /><br />The only reason I'm bothering to write this review (that nobody will read, I'm sure) is that I may have something to add to the conversation, even if it's a few decades too late to matter.  It's a 4 star review among a sea of 5 star reviews.  I really expected this book to be pure genius, because of how well it's loved.<br /><br />It is not genius though.  It seemed highly implausible in spots (the the point of sighing and eye rolling) and I came to wish I had read it when I was much younger.  They weren't StarWars-esque moments though, so they're hardly worth mentioning.  Also, both of the shocking plot twists were easy to see coming.  Were they meant to be shocking?  Was the foreshadowing meant to give it away?  I'd rather think not.  I think the book was simply written for a much younger audience than myself.<br /><br />Let me say again though, that I loved the book.  I just wasn't blown away like I expected.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I loved this game and the compuyer and atill play it now. This version is not as good, but it's still awesome.
1400052181|5.0|I approached this book with a bit of trepidation; I enjoy non-fiction books but I am not very keen on science books. Since this book involved a lot of scientific information I thought it might be dry and boring. I do however trust the opinions of several people who know my reading taste and they all assured me that this book was a must read. So I put aside my fear and started reading. I read almost non-stop for two days because this book was impossible to put down; the story of Henrietta Lacks and her family was well done and the science was explained in a clear and easy to understand manner. It is a book that proves the axiom \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\".<br /><br />In the early 50's Henrietta Lacks was a poor black woman living in the south; she was a wife, mother, sister and friend. When she was diagnosed with cervical cancer she was treated at the Johns Hopkins Center in the free clinic. While there some of her cells were removed for medical research, this was done without her knowledge. This was in the beginning days of cell research; Henrietta's cells had a unique ability to keep replicating, unlike other cells that would die off after a few days. These cells became known as HeLa cells and form the backbone of much biomedical research around the world since the time they were first taken some 60 years ago. Almost every single medical advance is in some way connected to HeLa cells.<br /><br />Henrietta died from the cancer that ravaged her body. Her family never knew about the cells that were taken from her and did not learn about it until the early 70's. Rebecca Skloot became interested in the story of the woman behind the cells while in school; it took her ten years to bring all the parts of this story together in this remarkable book she has written about this woman who unwittingly has done so much for medical research.<br /><br />Aside from the scientific story there is the story of the Lacks family; a family that for the most part never rose out of the abject poverty they had been living in for decades. Despite the fact the Hela sells have made millions of dollars by being sold millions of times over the Lacks family never received any compensation. Skloot reports the families story objectively, not making any comment on the ethics of the situation, leaving everyone to decide for themselves. She makes it pretty clear that none of us have any idea what is done with any of the cells that are taken in the course of any medical testing that we have.  Many of the medical waivers we sign basically relinquish our rights to the cells. This is a moral and ethical question that will be debated for years to come.<br /><br />This book has haunted my thoughts since they day I read it, I recommend it to anyone who is looking for a remarkable story of a woman that everyone of us should be thankful to every day of our lives.d been living in for decades.

B00335EQ0E|5.0|Alice in Wonderland is a 2-disc Disney DVD of one of Walt Disney Pictures' greatest animated classics.

The 2-disc special features includes a couple of interactive games, a featurette with interviews and commetaries, an old 1923 silent film, called \\"Alice's Wonderland\\" and more. Also, trailers for other Disney favorites like Old Dogs, Tinker Bell and The Great Fairy Rescue, My Friends Tigger and Pooh: Super Duper Sleuths and the re-release of James and The Giant Peach. Alice in Wonderland is truly one of the best Disney animated feature films everyone will enjoy!

B000O8OTNC|5.0|The sharpener is very light (probably weighs about 6 oz) and it is very handy. Not quite top notch quality and doesn't seem very durable, but a great buy for the price.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|If you're like me and are not a big Fantasy Fiction fan, you might be hesitating to purchase \\"The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)\\" and \\"The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two.\\"<br /><br />Usually I ignore the fantasy genre, but I was looking for a long, inexpensive book in which I could immerse myself. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was on sale, highly rated and, at almost 700 pages, it fulfilled my totally non-literary criterion.<br /><br />That was my intro to Rothfuss' fantasy series and I was immediately hooked. Remarkably likable characters, great descriptive writing and a not too crazy plot drew me in and helped me burn a couple days house sitting in Nowhere Colorado. I looked forward to buying Day 2.<br /><br />As much as I enjoyed Day 1, \\"The Wise Man's Fear: The Kingkiller Chronicle: Day Two\\" proved to be an even better read. Series aka franchises usually have little appeal to me. Rothfuss' is my exception and I can only hope he's at work pounding out Day 3.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|I did a lot of research on multi-tool's before I picked to buy this one. I was debating between this or a leatherman. I simply picked this one because of the price and what I wanted on a multi-tool which were: straight and serrated edge knifes, scissors, screwdrivers, and pliers. The handle is not really rubberized, more like 1/3 rubberized, but that doesn't matter to me. Love the spring loaded pliers and scissors and the locking feature for all the tools. Very glad I picked this one instead of one that would have cost 2x or 3x more
0439023483|5.0|I posted on facebook that I wanted a book I wouldn't be able to put down. There were multiple responses recommending this book. I thought this book was awesome! It was quite shocking in the beginning and I wasn't sure I wanted to read something with this storyline. However, after the first few pages, I was hooked! I got it yesterday on my Kindle and I finished it today. I read last night until my eyes couldn't stay open any longer! I just had to know what happened! Collins effectively made me care for the main character and I wanted her to win! If you can get past the initial shock of the \\"game,\\" you will surely enjoy this book! I can't wait to start the second book of the series! Read this - you won't be disappointed!
B001E45XT4|4.0|I bought this headset just because i needed one and i didn't want to spend too much on one so i looked online and found this. It looked very promising. I got it one day after i ordered it, and i was a little bit disappointed in the sound quality, its not bad but not great either. Music does not sound good on it but i must say when speaking to someone on Skype, it is very nice. Bass is not too good. The microphone though is very good, nice clear sound.<br /><br />In overall, this headset is great for its price and for anyone who talks on skype etc..

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Really fun and addicting game! works smooth on HTC evo. All the colors and graphics are pretty good. the game reminds me of a short version of the xbox 360 one.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|One of our favourite movies at the moment. Very funny, great story and beautiful message. Can't go wrong really. Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The game is fun and has kept me entertained for hours, but the way it behaves is irritating. If you try to multitask, even something as simple as a low battery notification, the game reloads. At least it is stable, something the other obvious iPhone ports can't say.
0061122416|4.0|[[ASIN:0061122416 The Alchemist]]    Just started reading this book and wondering why I missed it for such a long time.    Mark certain paragraphs in the book and keep in in your bookshelf.  Remember to read them through the years. You will not repent reading it over and over again.    This one is definitely for my book shelf.    A once in a lifetime book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so good I read it in one day. I couldn't put it down. I then purchased the second and third books in the trilogy and read them all in one weekend. When I had to put the book down to carry on my own life I couldn't stop thinking about it. Great read that moves very quickly.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just love it. Just totally addictive. I just wish there were more levels. I have already went through them all twice.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Awesome movie, story, acting, etc.  The blu ray quality was good, but not blown away 5 stars great.  I, too, could see the arrows in the beginning, plus different markings on the packaging so i'm assured it is the remastered version.
B00003CXTG|5.0|I was surprised to see all the negative review of the movie.  I loved it.   I had family who served in the Pacific in World War II, and virtually everyone who was around at that time can tell you a \\"Where I was when I heard about Pearl Harbor\\" story.    The relationships were great and true to a more family oriented less free sex and welfare time and values.  True, innocent bonding of buddies and brothers, and the likelihood that a brother or best friend would wind up with the girl if the guy was killed are true to the mores of the time.   It's perfectly logical that your brother or best friend would like your girl, you were all likely to have similar values, goals and aspirations.   This was a time period where most women did not work outside the home unless they had to, and if they did, they were likely in nursing or teaching.  There was no taxpayer funded welfare for generation after generation of unwed mothers.   Men married a girl they impregnated; that was the right and honorable and socially expected thing to do.  Cultural values supported responsiblity, loyalty and self-sacrifice adn did not promote selfishness.  Today selfishness is glorified in the media and even in schools and churches (liberation theology).      Danny is my favorite character, as he shows real heart, kindness and consideration even as a child dealing with his hard and somewhat abusive father.   He alone makes sure everyone else's heart is taken care of.      At the time the movie came out, I did some research and there were a couple of pilots who flew out of Hickam and made the first response by shooting down a number of attacking Japanese planes.  They were honored for it.       When the movie came out, a number of World War II vets were interviewed, and they all liked the movie, including the love story.       The haters, I think, are far more cynical people, (most likely liberals) and likely not imbued with the values of that time period.       I thought it was well done.    Be forewarned, even the Arizona memorial is now becoming politically correct and giving the \\"Japanese\\" point of view on Pearl Harbor, which is the real insult.   A memorial to murdered Americans does them dishonor by displaying the perverted opinions of their imperialist murderers---and before someone starts having leftist hysterics, I refer not to modern, relatively democratic Japanese, but to the literally imperialist and totalitarian Japanese empire, which is no more, and does not in fact, even have the same flag.   It's a memorial.  But then, there are some among us who think it's all right for a radical imam to plant a flag of conquest on Ground Zero.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I have a Baby Jogger City Mini and was looking for a parent tray cuz I and husband carry drinks for ourselves all the time.  Unfortunately BJCM does not come with a parent tray unless you order an expensive one.  So I grabbed this one at a store and tried it.  It is perfect.  I can still fold the stroller with this tray on, and there is no problem.  I like that I can put other stuff besides drinks.  My kid asks for cookies and snacks anytime but I can keep them on this tray so that I don't have to repeatedly take it out from my purse and put it back.  And you cannot beat this price!!!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|This album is PERFECT. It' more than music: it's a musical experience. The songs are so perfect that you never ever get tired of them...they take you along for the ride each and every single time...It's just awesome. The guitar is OUT OF THIS WORLD.
B00008K7AM|4.0|I guess this is what you get when you mix a chick flick with Rob Schneider humor. It's a pretty funny outcome. Rob Schneider and Rachel McAdams switch bodies, and so Rob Schneider plays a girl trapped in a 30-year-old guy's body. The movie goes through all the usual jokes in this type of movie (bathroom scene, \\"lesbo\\" romance, etc), but does it well. The movie really focuses on Rob Schneider's antics, rather than Rachel McAdams. That's one thing that could have been done better, to go back and forth between the characters more, especially because Rachel McAdams herself is such a talented actress. Overall, a good attempt at a redoing a classic theme.

B004GJYRFA|5.0|I have loved this show for so many years, I use to watch it in the school holidays when they showed an episode everyday in the morning. I was so happy to discover that I could buy the seasons on Amazon, which I did a while back but I had to write that I love, love, love this show!
B001DHXT1G|3.0|This is a fun blu-ray to show off your system with, with several instances of room shaking bass (provided your system has the chops for it).      I actually enjoyed this movie better than the Ang Lee version--more action and is more typical for a superhero movie--not nearly as melancholy and more enjoyable to me.    The reason I am writing this review, however, is that buyers should be aware that the digital copy offer has expired as of January, 2011 so I would not recommend purchasing this item if you really want a digital copy of the movie.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|This movie requires more than the usual amount of \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\".  There are some plot holes and irrational premises that, if you think too much about them, could mar your enjoyment of the movie.  On the other hand, you're already watching a movie that talks about demonic possession, angels and demons involving themselves in human activities, and a sort of cat-and-mouse battle between Heaven and Hell.  Glossing over a few illogical bits shouldn't require too much more effort.<br /><br />The special effects are good.  They showed some great imagination.  In many scenes, there are startling and sometimes disturbing images and events.  I found myself frequently bewildered by what was going on - though the questions were usually resolved later on in the film.<br /><br />I loved the various interesting characters - Constantine, the angel Gabriel, Balthazar (a half-demon), Papa Midnight (former witch doctor).  They were often complex, multi-dimensional characters.<br /><br />The story line involves atrocious theology - wholly unlike any religious teachings - but it's fun anyway.<br /><br />With its bizarre plot, creative special effects, weird characters, and imaginative evils, this is one of my favorite \\"supernatural\\" films.
1603420398|3.0|This book seemed to be so good,but it has some serious cons,the most serious being poor written instructions and the most irritating,that terribly noisy spiral binding.I found the circle motifs somewhat boring,but there are enough interesting patterns to keep your hook occupied.  The charts on the other hand were great and the same goes for the photos of the projects.I'm using it already,but I'm afraid it won't keep me interesting for long.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have a DroidX , VZW, and I have no problems loading or running the game. The graphics are just as good as the PC version so I'm not sure what people are complaining about unless the have older phones.  The game itself is brilliant.

I have played this game for hours on the xbox 360 and when picking this port up it feels very good on the android platform The music and graphics are all top notch This game is great addition any tower defense game collector..
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is amazing! My Thunderbolt runs it perfectly and without the stuttering people are complaining about. Also the graphics during normal game play are great, not sure what people are buggin about there. For people complaining about low resolution on their xooms, there is a tegra 2 version of the game, just not on amazon. That looks amazing on the xoom. My only issue with this game is the lack of an &quot;endless&quot; mode. Also the quick play option has pictures without descriptions or even a title which makes it confusing and I don't know what some of the options even are because of some of the pictures really don't help at all.
0425242099|4.0|In addition to the long awaited pairing of Snow Dancer wolf alpha Hawke and Psy Sienna Lauren, Kiss of Snow offers a big showdown between the Psy and the wolves, the birth of Lucas and Sascha's child and a second romance between Sienna's uncle Walker and pack healer Lara - as well as tons of cameos from the huge cast of the now ten book long series.<br /><br />As the sum of its parts, I liked Kiss of Snow. The parts where the Snow Dancer's make preemptive strikes against the Psy and the final battle was both climactic and emotionally intense. And I enjoyed seeing Lucas and Sascha, and was thrilled to witness their new arrival and what a powerful nurturing instinct the baby stirs up in all of the predatory Changelings.<br /><br />Now to Hawke and Sienna, while I wasn't exactly disappointed, their story isn't exactly what I'd hoped for either. Some of the intensity that Singh builds early on (and has been building for several books) is lessened by trying to draw the tension out way too long. Multiple times Singh stokes the fire between Hawke and Sienna and puts them in a situations where emotions (and attraction) are running high and then fades to black, leaving us wonder how they managed to avoid taking the next step when there has always been the feeling that should Hawke ever lower his barriers even for an instant, his wolf would claim Sienna in the most primal way. Add to that frequent interruptions every time that things start to get hot and heavy between them later in the book, plus thread switches to other story lines, and the result is that when they finally do come together it just wasn't as explosive as it could have been had some of the earlier situations been allowed to reach their natural conclusions. I am tempted to go back and read only their story thread and see if I have the same reaction without the thread shifts to chop things up.<br /><br />One my favorite parts of KoS was the side romance with Walker and Lara, which was sweet and complete and allowed Singh to finally clue us in on all of the details of the Walker family. Although in some ways, I wish that Singh would have saved their story for another book/novella. While the presence of Walker and Lara as individuals was key to this story, their story did take some of the focus from Hawke and Sienna - and some of what Lara goes through mirrors what is happening to Sienna, which had an impact on the emotional dynamic of the book as well.<br /><br />Still, I wouldn't have missed this installment in Singh's series and when all was said and done, I was happy to find that though Kiss of Snow was supposed to complete the initial Psy-Changeling story arc, the saga doesn't feel at all finished and I've read that there are more novellas and several full length books yet to come.wed Singh to finally clue us in on all of the details of the Walker family.

B004XJHBCE|5.0|This app makes Android what it should be! I hate clutter and now I can give each app, bookmark, widget etc. it's own custom icon as well as organize into folders & the folders each look different. No more generic looking folders!

It comes w/ a lot of icons, but if you use Google images you can download logos, tags or any sort of image appropriate for the folder, bookmark etc that you create.    I love this product and the support is excellent if you need it.
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|Please ignore the review below by Cat because it is merely an example of trolling. I don't doubt that Cat hates the show (I'm sure he/she would have given it a rating of zero stars if possible), but it is hard to take such a post seriously when it comes across as written by a child having a hissy fit. Not only is the reviewer overly reliant on such sophisticated adjectives such as \\"boring\\" and \\"whiny\\", the reviewer doesn't give any indication whatsoever that he/she even saw one minute of season two. I'm guessing Cat is purely one of those Stargate fans out there who despises SGU and takes pleasure (actually more like see it as a duty) to rip it to shreds at any opportunity all the while infecting the voting/ranking process with as low a vote as possible. It is the typical juvenile behavior that I have noticed is too common amongst Stargate fandom.    No wonder such folks wouldn't care for Stargate Universe. Stargate Universe is for adults. No, I'm not being a snob. SGU bashers have made their view of the world quite clear since they first attacked SGU for having the audacity to show people having sex and people hooking up quickly.  They don't care for a show, a science fiction show of all things, to have leading characters who are duplicitous, scheming, hostile, mistrusting. They don't want to see leaders who have doubts and serious flaws and make, at times, bad judgments. They don't want conflict, instead they want crew members to be chums (or putting it in a language they may understand better...BFFs) immediately. They aren't use or comfortable with characters who display some dark tendencies and a bit of amorality from time to time. Most of all they just loathe putting character and relationships ahead of action and special effects. To do these things, as SGU has done, makes the show boring to them. Argue that the way SGU handles its characters is a more realistic approach and they will snap back with something like \\"I don't watch TV for reality because I get enough of that in the real world, blah, blah, blah\\".         There is no getting through to them and frankly I stopped caring about doing so over a year ago. If they didn't care for the show that's fine. But some of us like our sci fi to be more intelligent. We don't care for cardboard comic book characters who always do the right thing and make the right decisions. We prefer characters with complexity, characters who are grey. We don't care for characters who are \\"safe\\" and the exact same from beginning of a series to the end. We prefer characters who actually show some growth. We don't need main characters who are so-called \\"likable\\" because they tell jokes every two minutes and mug for the camera at every opportunity. Instead we are drawn to characters that are interesting because of their flaws and as a result we find those people \\"likable\\" because we can relate to them and we can appreciate their own battles to overcome their more negative traits. To be blunt viewers like myself enjoy a show that takes its time in trying to develop and evolve its primary characters. The friendships, the closer bonds that form amongst the Destiny crew during the second season are more worthwhile because of, yes, the amount of time it took for those people to get to that point. There wasn't any Star Trek: Voyager rush job here.  These characters had to EARN each other's trusts.     Bashers of SGU like to dismiss these characteristics by pointing out that it was all just New Battlestar Galactica rehash. I guess they don't realize that dark sci fi shows existed before BSG and that some of the very best of science fiction explore the human condition rather than alien planets. Those that hated SGU also would often brush off the characters as being \\"stupid\\" for not immediately putting all their differences aside and working for the common good. But those of us who both live in the real world and don't mind seeing its truism reflected in TV shows, understood that the \\"wrong people\\" beingtrust into that situation would have to overcome such issues. And don't get me started on how the critics of SGU went on and on about how too much time was devoted to romantic relationships on the show (actually a bit of an exaggeration). This led them to the popular reference of SGU as a soap opera. Again that only showed the limited grasp these folks had regarding what type of plots could be handled on a space show. What is wrong with relationships? They are part of life, and therefore should be incorporated in the SGU story arc.  Besides romantic relationships have been part of grand storytelling long before soap operas were even invented. I would warn such folks who are afraid of such storylines to stay away from something like \\"The Odyssey\\" because by their definition that classic epic would also contain too many of those weepy/feely soap opera characteristics.       SGU wasn't perfect and surely season one could have been better, but even during its early stumbling it did not insult my intelligence.  Thankfully it didn't contain a bunch of villains with glowing eyes and vibrating voices. Every week its crew did not stumble across forest villages on alien worlds filled with a bunch of English-speaking people. The problems of every episode were not wrapped up neatly at the end of every hour and thankfully that meant we were to be spared the science types delivering some technobabble speech as they explained how they would save the day. There was actual strong continuity. The problems with supplies was handled very well because Destiny was in need of them on a regular basis which drove home that these people did not have the comforts of Earth. The show itself had fantastic sets and for my money also had the best continuing music score that I can ever recall for a science fiction series.  The direction was so stellar that the look of the series alone was worthy of HBO or AMC. It provided a great and expansive cast and it did a terrific job of spreading the wealtharound to ALL characters. There wasn't any criminal underuse (and then dismissal) of characters ala Ford of Stargate Atlantis. And as mentioned above these characters kept evolving.  Not only did the main players such as Young, Eli, Greer, etc grow more than virtually all the characters of the previous series did, but even the supporting characters of SGU (Volker, Park) developed in ways that would put the main characters of the previous series to shame.  Most importantly SGU was able to bring life to these characters by hiring the best group of actors to ever inhabit a Stargate show.  Sure the Richard Dean Andersons and Joe Flanigans are clearly better at pointing weapons and fighting vile alien beings, but neither could display the wide range of emotion that Louis Ferreira displayed in second season episodes like \\"Aftermath\\", \\"Trial and Error\\", \\"The Greater Good\\" and \\"Gauntlet\\". It's not even close.      The strong second season of SGU indicated it had clearly found its voice and considering how incredible the last of half of the season was I'm confident in predicting the best was yet to come. I don't buy the argument that a good show doesn't take that long to get to that point. Tell that to Star Trek: The Next Generation, Deep Space Nine and Babylon 5. Actually ST:TNG didn't even get good until season three but fortunately for it  it was the only game in town at the time serving a need for sci fi fans who had been starving for a good space series for over a decade.  It didn't hurt that it was airing on syndication either. But back to my point season two was the best season of Stargate with episodes like  \\"Malice\\", \\"visitation\\", \\"Resurgence\\", \\"Twin Destinies\\", \\"Common Descent\\" and \\"Blockade\\" being some of the standouts. And were there ever two more powerful Stargate episodes than \\"Epilogue\\" and \\"Gauntlet\\" (the former being perhaps the most ambitious story Stargate ever told with the latter being both a bittersweet and emotionally fulfilling closure to the SGU storyline)?  So much to praise but what I'll miss is the continual banter between Volker and Brody (their scenes provided humor that wasn't forced but still brilliant), the further growth of Eli, the commitment between Matt and Chloe, Jamil Walker Smith's spectacularly elevating Greer into one of the franchise's best characters, TJ and Park trying to overcome the bad hand they were dealt towards the end, Young being forced to make the tough and adult decisions that Jack and John never had to, and of course Rush's continued walk down the moral tightrope. And believe it or not I will miss those drones who turned out to be the persistent, deadly threat that the Borg once were before they were watered down (a villain doesn't need some English-speaking mouthpiece like a Borg Queen to come across as effectively chilling).   I wish the show had more time but if it was to go out, at least it went out the right way by getting stronger week after week. By the time its run came to an end it was at its peak. Kudos to the writers and the staff for such a fine show. Adult science fiction on TV took a hit with its cancellation.
B0036S4CTS|5.0|Like most great books there is often at least one event that is likely to be discussed in reviews that will spoil not only the ending but at least in my opinion the way in which you experience the book. One Day is one such book. One Day is the story of Dexter and Emma over the course of 20 years. Each year we are let into their lives for one day, the anniversary of the day they met. It is wonderful story told in an amazing way and will stick with you long after you have finished it. Upon finishing it I was both very thankful and angry with the person who recommended it which is generally a indicator or a great book.
B004QPOVE6|5.0|Just GREAT.  Shows the Black Ice Tour at its very best.  Crank up that volume and share it with the neighbors.  The HD picture is a bonus too.  AC/DC are the ultimate live band. At what other concerts would you see 72 year old women and 5 year old kids (and every age inbetween) having the time of their lives? That's how the Seattle show was.  If you like AC/DC - buy it! You won't be disappointed. AC/DC...We Salute You.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|\\"X-Men: First Class\\" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Before mutants had revealed themselves to the world, and before Charles Xavier and Erik Lehnsherr took the names Professor X and Magneto, they were two young men discovering their powers for the first time. Not archenemies, they were instead at first the closest of friends, working together with other Mutants (some familiar, some new), to prevent nuclear Armageddon. In the process, a grave rift between them opened, which began the eternal war between Magneto's Brotherhood and Professor X's X-Men.    The cast led by James McAvoy (as Charles Xavier), Michael Fassbender (as Erik Lehnsherr) & Jennifer Lawrence (as Raven / Mystique) is great. The directing by Matthew Vaughn (who also co-wrote the screenplay) is great. The story by Bryan Singer (who also produced) & Sheldon Turner & the screenplay by Vaughn, Jane Goldman, Ashley Miller & Zack Stentz is great.    The music by Henry Jackman is great. The cinematography by John Mathieson is great. The film editing by Lee Smith & Eddie Hamilton is great. The casting by Roger Mussenden, Jeremy Rich & Lucinda Syson is great. The production design by Chris Seagers is great. The art direction by Grant Armstrong, Paul Booth, Alex Cameron, Steve Cooper, Tom Frohling, Alan Gilmore, James Hambidge, Marc Homes, Joe Howard, John King, Adam O'Neill & Su Whitaker is great. The set decoration by Erin Boyd & Sonja Klaus is great. The costume design by Sammy Sheldon is great. The make-up effects by Alec Gillis & Tom Woodruff, Jr. is great. The visual effects design by John Dykstra is great.    This is an excellent prequel to the X-Men movies, that is fun and entertaining, and is also just as excellent, if not, better than the other X-Men movies. This is an excellent origin story that keeps your mind thinking, your heart racing and also keeps you on the edge of your seat entertainment. This is one of the best movies of the year and of the summer, so far.
B00092ZMDY|2.0|totally bad ass, Joe walsh is an icon add in the eagles songs really there nothing to review is as good as you hope it would be.  two stars because i degenerate the star system, I am sooo fool. the sound is top of the line. The music sound is top of the line top of the line  top of the  top of  top  I gotta admitt- in some way the way they treat Joe makes me feel kinda warm and fuzzy. they dont really make a point of \\" Were playing with Joe Walsh\\" but they recognise that any musican would like to say that- even if they had some great songs before he joined them. I just have a peaceful easy feeling about saying that so take it easy wichy women one of these nights love will keep us alive- we will take it to the limit and then enjoy the tequila sunrise  and that aint easy to spell). I cant tell you why it seems like wasted time youll just have to trust your lying eyes- you belong to the city  and I just walk away.  What other band has 3 talents that are great alone collaberating? You could say the beatles- but does Harrision = Joe walsh ?   watching Joe is fun   cant imagine why anyone would need to read this review  if your on the fence buy it you @#! its as good as you hope it will be, hope it will be maybe, hope,be.  no Problems here\  move it along already

I beat the adventure and was playing on the bonus games, now, whenever I go into certain bonus games it asks if I want to resume and whether I choose resume or new game, it completely shuts off the game.  I also agree it is terribly annoying that even a screen time out shuts out the game.  Please fix
0061251305|5.0|What separates average companies from those that excel?<br /><br />In their ten-year field study of twenty-four thousand people in two dozen organizations, \\"Tribal Leadership\\" authors Dave Logan, John King, and Halee Fischer-Wright found their answer in the relationship between tribes formed by employees (natural formations) and the tribe's leader.<br /><br />Tribes are the basic building block of any large human effort determining how much work gets done and the quality of the work they do. Tribes and tribal leaders create each other. Tribes range in size from 20 to 150 people with small companies generally being one tribe and large companies being a tribe of tribes.<br /><br />\\"Tribal culture exists in stages, going from undermining to egocentric to history making.\\"<br />These five stages (stage 5 outperforms stage 4, etc.) are identified and characterized by the authors - each has its unique way of speaking, type of behavior, and structure of relationships:<br /><br />* Stage one - 2% of all tribes - bind together to get a ahead in a violent and unfair world. Marked by hostility.<br />* Stage two - 25% - passively antagonistic; \\"my life sucks,\\" a cluster of apathetic victims.<br />* Stage three - 49% - \\"I'm great and you are not.\\" Knowledge is power and it is hoarded for control. Trust is hard earned.<br />* Stage four - 22% - \\"We're great.\\" This tribe always has an adversary. Trust is assumed.<br />* Stage five - 2% - language revolves around infinite potential and how the group is going to make history, not to beat a competitor, but to have global impact.  This stage is pure leadership, vision, and inspiration.<br /><br />With this perspective, the authors then get to the heart and soul of the book, outlining the steps, identifying the leverage points, and providing the tools a leader can use to upgrade his/her tribe from one stage to another - with the goal of building a high performance tribe that excels. They have also created a website, [...], as a resource for those wanting more.<br /><br />The tribal cultures of IDEO, CB Richard Ellis' Private Client Group, and She Beads are used throughout the book as examples o emphasize key points.<br /><br />\\"Tribal Leadership\\" provides great value and is a must read for those interested in becoming a better leader and/or those wanting to insure their business strategies succeed rather than fail (70% fail). I have chosen to integrate this book into the limited C-level mentoring I do.<br /><br />See also my review of Seth Godin's \\"Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us.\\"O, CB Richard Ellis' Private Client Group, and She Beads are used throughout the book as examples o emphasize key points.     \\"Tribal Leadership\\" provides great value and is a must read for those interested in becoming a better leader and/or those wanting to insure their business strategies succeed rather than fail (70% fail).

B004JK61K0|5.0|I've tried many email apps, and this one is the best.  TONS of options so that you can configure it just the way you want.  Unified inbox is great, but would be better if it gave you the option of checking all mail accounts at once instead of requiring you to check each account manually.  Of course it supports automatically checking each account at the time interval of your choosing.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've never played this game on iPhone and when it came to Android I only got it because it was free for the day.  I was hesitant on getting yet another tower defense game.  Although this is a tower defense game, it doesn't just become building the same stuff over and over again.  The plants you can build and the zombies that attack are incredibly diversified.  After almost every level you will get a new plant to stop a new threat.  I keep going back to play in order to see what new plant/zombie I'm going to get for the next mission.  Very fun, definitely worth the price if you didn't get it free!
1400076943|5.0|I just finished re-reading this masterpiece. And the second time was better than the first. When I describe this book to others, I find myself able to recall the colors, sounds, and feelings that Adichie provokes with her vivid descriptions of human emotion. Absolutely amazing. There are times when you get totally connected with the main character and as the reader, you're able to appreciate the narrator's vivid and articulate descriptions of her inability to express herself verbally in her interactions with others. This is a paradox that I don't think many writers could really pull off. However, Ms. Adichie nails it! She grabs your emotions and takes you on a ride for which preparation is impossible. For me, that is the sign of a promising writer with a bright future. I definitely recommend this one and look forward to reading more by this author.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|the is one of the best free apps amazon has offered so far! i would recommend this game to everyone!!
0312427565|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  The closing interlacing scene is something I'll never forget.  The seven astronauts who were selected for the Mercury project and who've newly moved to Houston sit transfixed as a dancer entrances them onstage.  Meanwhile, Chuck Yeager, possibly America's greatest pilot ever, is attempting another record, crashing into the stratosphere and into space before descending, crashing, and emerging unfazed from the burning wreckage.  Chuck Yeager came to symbolize American exceptionalism and bravery, the noble \\"single-combat warrior\\" in Tom Wolfe's words.<br /><br />And I've enjoyed, more or less, Tom Wolfe's fiction.  Yes, \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" and \\"A Man in Full\\" seemed a bit ponderous and ambitious for what were just silly, entertaining plots, but \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" was a truly great novel.<br /><br />In short, I was really looking forward to the book.  But I found myself struggling to finish the book.<br /><br />First, nothing really happens in the book.  Seven test pilots are chosen to be America's astronauts, but unfortunately the Soviets have clearly and outrageously beaten the Americans in the space race.  Also, the astronauts aren't really required to do anything -- in fact, an ape could and did do their job.  Third, the outlandish government spending, the media fanfare, and the fact that the Soviets have already proven it could be done mean that there's an inevitability to NASA's success.  The real interesting story seemed to be the test pilots, but they've long been eclipsed by the astronauts.<br /><br />Second, Wolfe's writing, while meant to be of the moment and to bring history to the reader (or reader to the history), isn't that great.  He screams a bit too much, and it lacks the elegance and style of his more mature self.<br /><br />Yes, it's great that America finally caught up to the Soviets, put a man in space, and then proved good old American superiority by putting a man on the moon.  But after the trillions spent, what exactly did America get in the end?  It's amazing what America with its wealth, ingenuity, and resources could accomplish if it really put its mind to it:  too bad it must also aspire to the worst or less significant goals.
1439107955|5.0|I am a Ph.D student working in the field of cancer. One of my friends suggested me this book. I just checked it on Amazon and ordered it immediately. Sid has taken me through all emotions. You feel pain, you smile, you feel agony..what not. This book is written so well, just like a craftsman making a master piece. Marvelous job for a writer who is writing a first book. Not just a biography, this book is more that inspiration. Go, enjoy your journey in the world of cancer with Sid.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I was a full-blown (in many respects) adult when I first saw this movie, loved it then - love it now - and it will always be one of my favorites.  Definitely a film for the family to watch together, adventure, challenge, daring, hope, love, comedy, all the lessons that life can teach!!!!!   SEE THIS!!!!  with popcorn if necessary (smile)
B00498TQV8|5.0|Never ask for what ought to be offered... Winter's Bone is one of the most important and best American movies ever made. If you want a slice of truth and reality, this is an excellent antidote to Beverly Hills anything. Jennifer Lawrence is riveting!!! Even in a seemingly brutal and unforgiving world, there is place for hope, redemption, and most importantly dignity and love.
0316098329|5.0|I loved this book, and yet was horrified by it.  The premise of a young woman being locked up by a predator gave me nightmares, but the story of how she makes life manageable for her son (born in captivity) was touching and thought-provoking for me.  I don't want to give anything away, so I won't discuss how the plot-line develops.  Suffice to say that it gave me a whole new perspective on the world.  It was similar to the movie \\"Life is Beautiful\\", both awful and awe-inspiring.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love tower defense games and I can understand why this one was such a big hit now that I've finally played it. $1.50 for hours of fun and plenty of laughs. Some replayability after finishing adventure mode, too, with all the other things to do in the game.
1936719010|5.0|Published as the second book of the \\"Domino Project\\" series, \\"Do the work\\" re-emphasizes in a concise and easy to read way the theme of resistance that Pressfield wrote about in \\"The War of Art\\" so impressively. While the latter is still a must-read, \\"Do the Work\\" may serve as either a teaser for the real thing or as your second building block to start off on your path as a \\"Linchpin\\" - an analogy used by Seth Godin in his book of the same name urging us all to live more self-determined and fulfilled lives than we do today.<br /><br />\\"Linchpin\\" is leaning heavily on Pressfield's picture of the lizard, a symbol of the reptilian brain, that is holding us back by creating fear of change in us all the time, and so it makes sense to have him provide the second booklet of the series. Other than Godin, Pressfield does, however, tackle the aspect of failure and how to deal with it, which makes \\"Do the Work\\" special to me. In a recent discussion I asked Seth about why he is apparently ignoring the fallout of failure (see also my previous review on \\"Linchpin\\" on [...] to get the details of my argument), and he answered that - given a choice between my gloomy hyperbole of having to deal with failure and his hyperbole of looking forward to eventual success, he'd prefer his. Fair enough, but the issue remains and if Seth probed this \\"hyperbole\\" among his most faithful followers in his \\"Triiibes\\" club he might change his point of view.<br /><br />Either way, Steven Pressfield helps us stare failure in the eye, and despite is brevity  \\"Do the work\\" provides a clear view of how to be considerate of the possibility of failure, and how to deal with it when it happens - without falling victim to the lizard brain. As such, \\"Do the Work\\" is a necessary and useful addition or even a missing chapter of \\"Linchpin\\" you should definitely read.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Simply put, this makes life easier, adding imperative features to what you'd get with just the stock google calender. I can't really think of anything to complain about. I guess if I had to try really hard to find something, I could say it's not &quot;pretty&quot; in terms of fonts and graphics, but it keeps me abreast of what's going on in my life, so who cares? Plus, the down to earth-ness of it's looks makes it seem like the gritty calender that could next to the prettier google stock, the one you'd root for in the movies if hollywood ever made one about two executives who each choose a different path in the android calender apps...
078322799X|5.0|This is one of the earlier attempts of Peter Jackson at directing and it is an entertaining film; comedy with a twist and, of course special effects. It was good to see it again after all these years. It certainly stood the test of time.
0061438294|5.0|I've read many books on body language, and this one is, by far, the best.  Navarro writes in a clear, concise, and accessible manner.  He educates the reader a great deal, detailing what body language behaviors to look for, what they mean, why they mean what they do, and how exactly to go about looking for them.  The information is presented in an organized fashion, and the stories he shares from his professional experiences greatly enrich the book.    Overall, it was a very interesting and informative read.  If you have to get just one book on body language, this is it.  For anyone who is interested in learning more about body language, this book is a must read.
B000THIHA4|5.0|I cannot emphasize enough how spectacular this 5-star album is. How much creativity and effort is poured into every single one of these tracks. To me, this is the album that defines Daft Punk - Melodious vocals, well placed beats, perfect timing, and unique musical ideas. One More Time, Aerodynamic, Digital Love, Harder Better Faster Stronger, Something About Us, Voyager, Short Circuit, Face to Face, and Too Long are all quite exceptional tracks, and none of the other songs are mediocre enough to be labeled album filler. Let's get right to the song by song analysis:<br /><br />1. One More Time - 5/5 Stars. This track is absolutely classic. A shimmering music track with perfectly timed vocals and beats. Very fun to dance to. It doesn't matter if you're a techno fan or not. No one can dislike this song.<br /><br />2. Aerodynamic - 5/5 Stars. A remarkable track. Very well put together, with an interesting sound and very rapid notes. This song is very creative, and takes on an almost magical sound from 2:30 to the end. This song is extremely cool. Not one of Daft Punks most famous tracks but it should be.<br /><br />3. Digital Love - 5/5 Stars. Catchy, well timed beat. Cute vocals. Cute lyrics. This is a very feel-good song. Like Aerodynamic, the track gets more and more awesome as the song progresses. At 3:25 a crazy guitar riff is added, giving the song a wild climax to 4:25. Then the song cools down to a peaceful ending.<br /><br />4. Harder Better Faster Stronger- 5/5 Stars. Probably one of Daft Punks most famous songs, and for good reason. This song is perfectly timed with progressive vocals and an irresistible beat. Extremely fun to dance to. It's also fun to see how long you can keep up with the vocals before you run out of breath. It's hard to describe what makes this track so epic. You just have to hear it.<br /><br />5. Crescendolls - 4/5 Stars for techno fans, 3/5 Stars for casual audiences. There's only one word to describe this track: weird. But if you're like me and love music that is creative to the point of strangeness, you will enjoy this track. More casual listeners, however, will think this sounds pretty nasty. This one's harder to dance to. This song is good, but not on the same tier as the first four tracks, and probably too weird for many people.<br /><br />6. Nightvision - 4/5 Stars. There's nothing wrong with this song, except it doesn't feel complete. Well under two minutes long, it doesn't feel like a song. It is also quite un-danceable. To its credit, it is well put together and very soothing to listen to. Again, no real complaint here, just not as epic as the first four tracks.<br /><br />7. Superheroes - 4/5 Stars. A good track. Steady beat. Well timed. Danceable. However, the lyrics are extremely repetitive, which isn't a problem for me, but take it down a notch from the awesome vocals in One More Time, Digital Love, and Harder Better Faster Stronger. Altogether, a solid track, but not outstanding.<br /><br />8. High Life - 4/5 Stars for techno fans, 3/5 Stars for casual listeners. Same story as Crescendolls. A high pitched voice shouting BAAAM, BUUUM, BAAAM, BUUM over and over. This song is just silly. But, as a fan of creatively weird techno I still enjoy listening to it.<br /><br />9. Something About Us - 5/5 Stars. A sublime, relaxing song with touching vocals. Like Nightvision, not a danceable song. I love this track. Like Digital Love, it shows that techno can make love songs too, and good ones at that.<br /><br />10. Voyager - 5/5 Stars. This song is delightful. A distorted bassline under a shimmering track. At 2:16 a quick xylophone-ish note progression is added, meshing perfectly with the first two musical elements. Not very danceable, but overall as good as the first four tracks.<br /><br />11.Veridis Quo - 4/5 Stars. Similar to Nightvision, only a complete song. It progresses very slowly, but very naturally, and grows more and more complex. Soothing to listen to, but not danceable. A greattrack.<br /><br />12. Short Circuit- 5/5 Stars for techno fans, 3/5 stars for casual listeners. Excellent song from 0:00-1:40. The first 1:40 is great for breakdancing and extremely catchy. Then the song slows down, to a riff that grows more and more distorted until the song ends. Near the end the track gets very choppy. Casual listeners will hate this part. As a techno fan I find this intriguing and melodious in its own way. Very creative, very catchy at the beginning and very interesting at the end.<br /><br />13. Face to Face - 5/5 Stars. Brilliant. Creative. Great vocals. Fascinating beat. I would go as far as to call this the best song in the album. The music is all over the place, but somehow makes something perfectly harmonious. We then move on to great vocals with a steady beat in the background. The song also has an interesting message to it, but I'll leave the lyrical interpretation to you. I wish this song was a lot longer. It feels like the ending is way too early, especially for a techno song. I think Daft Punk should've extended this song another 2 minutes. But as it stands, it's still an absolutely brilliant, catchy, danceable song.<br /><br />14.Too Long - 5/5 Stars. Well, it's a 10:00 minute song called \\"Too Long.\\" The question stands- is this song literally too long, or is it 10 minutes of quality music? I would say the latter. It has a natural progression with great vocals and an interesting message. When the beat finally kicks in at 1:38 its very catchy and danceable. The music gradually swells, ebbs, and changes, over the duration of the song, but remains interesting and catchy. An excellent end to the album that is certainly not too long.<br /><br />Discovery is a shining gem among techno albums. Even if you're not much of a techno head, you'll find a great deal of these songs enjoyable. This is the best $9.49 I've spent in my life, but you're making a huge mistake if you leave this page without downloading \\"Face to Face\\" at the very least. Thanks for reading!

B0042816YK|2.0|Thanks for crapping all over a story about growth, healing, enlightenment, and love, and turning into the same old boring flick we've seen a million times, Hollywood. The interesting spiritual stuff is gone, even the food parts are uninteresting. I don't really buy the love story at all. This movie has some elements of the book, sure, but none of the depth.<br /><br />I hesitated to watch this. It was on Netflix, so I figured I'd give it a go, since I don't have to pay any more for it. Yeah, bad idea. For gutting the story like it did, it was way too long. The scenery wasn't as cool as it should have been, and the characters other than Gilbert were not explored at all, let alone as deeply as they were in the book.<br /><br />Okay, fine, I get that's what Hollywood does. However, this was an autobiographical work. These were real people who got turned into props. Gilbert's own amazing and inspiring spiritual journey got totally pushed to the backseat. She does some emotional work in the movie, but all of the spiritual enlightenment, which is a beautiful and amazing story in and of itself, is gone.<br /><br />Elizabeth Gilbert is a real person, and I just don't think she deserves to be portrayed as a shallow idiot with no introspection. Especially after she went through the spiritual work and was wonderful enough to share that with the rest of us by writing it down in her book.<br /><br />Really, just take the time to read the book.

Seven year old Lavinia is orphaned while travelling from Ireland as the daughter of indentured servants. Her \\"owner\\", not knowing what to do with her, gives her to one of the kitchen slaves on his plantation, Belle, his illegitimate daughter. Although white, she becomes a member of Belle's family, setting up a complex situation of mixed loyalties, that ultimately leads to tragic consequences. This is a compelling, well-told story.\\"

B00004T9UF|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Eminem album, because I don't just \\"put up\\" with the content of his lyrics, I actually enjoy the content. Some people say it's too harsh and controversial, but people need to realize he speaks his mind no matter what it is. Also, Eminem was trying to separate himself from the rest of the pop-culture(he says so in an interview about his offensive lyrics), becuase he was constantly grouped up in that category. So to the music review, I love every single song on this album except \\"Remember Me?\\" and \\"Amityville\\", (Amityville is still a solid song, just forgettable). This album has good production, but not great like The Eminem Show, and has great flow and lyrical ability from Eminem to make this my favorite Eminem record to date. Although I love the content of this album, i've come to realize that if Eminem kept putting out albums similar to this, everyone would get sick of him. (Even me)    My standout tracks: Stan (One of the best rap songs ever), The Way I Am, I'm Back, Marshall Mathers, Criminal, and Who Knew.    10/10

B000005RFQ|5.0|After the dismissal of vocalist Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinnie Appice, guitarist Tony Iommi and bassist Geezer Butler recruited former Deep Purple Vocalist Ian Gillan, brought back original drummer Bill Ward, and recorded a rock masterpiece!<br /><br />Opening with the fierce and fast \\"Trashed\\", the album \\"Born Again\\" kicks off to a rollicking heavy start right away. Blending riffs from old and new Sabbath styles, \\"Trashed\\" is a great throwback to something like \\"Tomorrow's Dream\\". And the main rhythm is simply \\"Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath\\" sped up!<br /><br />Next, the instrumental \\"Stonehenge\\" lulls the listener into a false sense of serenity before the next track blasts them out of their chair. \\"Disturbing The Priest\\" is possibly the heaviest, most sinister song from Sabbath since their first two or three albums! A riff heavily `borrowed' from Ian Gillan's own \\"Scarabus\\", mixed with lyrics like \\"the Devil and the priest can't exist with one goes away', this makes for one awesome gargantuan heavy metal song!<br /><br />But, my favorite song on the album would have to be the next track \\"Zero The Hero\\" (following a very brief instrumental interlude called \\"The Dark\\"). This is without a doubt the heaviest song ever from Black Sabbath! This is \\"Iron Man\\" meets \\"Into The Void\\" on steroids!<br /><br />The great riffmeister Iommi laid down some blistering tracks here. This is FULL of mean riffs and rhythms that are a glorious throwback to the early days of Sabbath (think \\"Master of Reality\\" and \\"Sabotage\\"). Songs like \\"Trashed\\", \\"Disturbing The Priest\\", \\"Zero The Hero\\", and the title track are true classics!<br /><br />I also believe Geezer played a part in the sound of this album. Listen to \\"Zero the Hero\\", he's all over the place! Matter of fact, Judas Priest blatantly stole Geezer's bass riff from that song for the intro to their song \\"Love Bites\\", which came out later in the same year. And Guns & Roses blatantly stole the entire riff for their \\"Paradise City\\".<br /><br />The sound was SO unique, harkening back to a sound like the very 1st three albums.<br /><br />I have always thought \\"Born Again\\" was one of Sabbath's best albums, of any era. Why? Because when you strip away all the critiques of cover art/lineup/sound mix, \\"Born Again\\" was really getting to the heart of the sound and mood Sabbath achieved with their first album: Ambient, dark, bluesy, ferocious and entirely unique. Much like their debut album, you won't hear another album quite like this. Ever again.<br /><br />The sound mix is \\"bad\\" by a normal standard, but I almost feel it does these songs a service. They are raw, unpolished and powerful. Iommi's riffs are as good as any of the classic Ozzy era stuff. And Gillan....goodness I don't know that you could find a better singer to match the sound and mood of this particular album. His performance here was balls-out (literally, if you know that story) heart on sleeve primal. It's a shame that Gillan himself, along with a large portion of the listening audience, didn't \\"get\\" this album.<br /><br />I firmly believe \\"Born Again\\" was entirely an attempt by Iommi to reinvent the band by taking it back to what made Sabbath great to begin with. Away from the late-Ozzy experimentations of \\"Never Say Die\\" and \\"Technical Ecstasy\\". Away from the ultra-polished D&D gems of the Dio era. This was Sabbath `born again`, as Iommi wished to shape it. Of course that long-term vision failed, but what a great single album document we have with this record.<br /><br />One of the best Black Sabbath albums ever created. \\"Born Again\\" with the iconic Ian Gillan at the helm this time around definitely renewed my appreciation for Black Sabbath. Sabbath's most underrated album. The title track is especially good., possibly one of the most haunting songs in rock history, in my opinion. Ian Gillan's talent for not only singing, but also as a lyricist shown really bright on that one in particular.<br /><br />First of all, let's get something straight, no matter how rough Sabbath's career may have turned in the 80's, their albums never went to any cutout bins! As a matter of fact, this one even placed well on the charts for a brief period.<br /><br />And this version of the band live was probably the most sinister sets that Sabbath ever turned in. Gillan's continuous screaming/singing/screaming amidst the gloom and doom of the titanic Iommi/Butler riffs, this made for one hell of a terrific year for Black Sabbath! They didn't call the album \\"Born Again\\" for nothing!<br /><br />I have a problem (since I am a drummer) with the sound of the drums in the mix on this one, however. Even live, it was the strangest drum sound they ever had. I've recently started to referring to it as the \\"drummer un-friendly album/tour\\". Speaking of drummers, Bill Ward wasn't able to tour for this album, so Sabbath brought in ELO skin basher Bev Bevan.<br /><br />I've been listening to \\"Live at Reading 83\\" (which is one of MANY cd's I have from that tour) and I have to say that the more I listen to it, it is possibly the most 'sinister' that Sabbath had sounded since their first 3 cds. Their set list changed somewhat throughout the tour, but I prefer the \\"Reading Festival\\" list.<br /><br />Ian Gillan made the song \\"Black Sabbath\\" HIS, making Ozzy and RJ Dio sound like amatuers compared to him singing it. The second best is Glenn Hughes, believe it or not, on the \\"Seventh Star\\" tour (well, the 3 or 5 days before he was fired), he REALLY sounds sinister as h*ll! But, my pick will always be Ian Gillan on that one, as well as all the Ozzy songs, for Ian not only screamed his head off, sounding very sinister, he gave the Ozzy-era songs a whole new 'passion' that was missing from any of the other singers versions.<br /><br />As for the cover, why don't BS fans pick on the awful \\"Vol 4\\" cover...Now, that's the WORST Black Sabbath album cover ever in my opinion. The album cover is pure genius, because after all Black Sabbath was truly `Born Again'. People ought to be picking on the god-awful Ozzy \\"Bark At the Moon\\" cover by the same artist, Steve Joule. Now, there was a BAD cover!<br /><br />(Footnote to other reviewers on here: If you don't like the cover, then don't buy the cd! The baby devil is the PERFECT cover for the title they chose.) This is a must for any Black Sabbath fan! Rock on! :>)<br /><br />By the way, this is not a review of the recently released Deluxe Edition. I do find it very ironic however that I mentioned the Reading Festival cd in my review, and then I see that the Reading Festival is added as a bonus cd on the Deluxe Edition. And, as for the bonus song \\"The Fallen\\", while I feel it is a very good song, I see why it was not on the original album, because it sounds more like something from Gillan's solo career, or something from his stint in Deep Purple than it does Sabbath. And, as for the quality of the Deluxe Edition, well, sorry, I have no idea what that is like, and frankly, since I already have all of the \\"bonus\\" stuff on bootleg cd's, well, I really don't see the need to purchase it.

B0051MKMNC|5.0|Spoiler Alert!<br />Okay, this movie was made awhile back before Bradley Cooper was the current hot shot he is today. I love him. This is NOT a Bradley Cooper gets the girl movie!!! He is one of the two guys going after the main chic in this flick. I'm a big movie goer/watcher yet I know that I don't know all that goes into a movie. But I do know this... this was a cheap movie. The acting is bad. The music, horrible! And the only thing that would make the plot tolerable is if one of the men actually got the girl in the end. Sorry!!! I was excited when I saw a Bradley Cooper movie listed on my Amazon Video on Demand. I hadn't heard of it??? I looked it up on the best website out there, IMDb. Not a whole lot there. In fact at the time, there wasn't even one rating. But the trailer was there. So, I watched it. Hmmm, I thought? Looks pretty good. Looks funny. Well of course, the only good parts are shown in the trailer. I know I sound harsh. I'm sorry. Believe it or not, I give most movies a pretty good rating. Really! And no offense to Bradley Cooper, because, yes, I do love you!!! But I believe this movie was only released on DVD because he's a star now. If you haven't seen LIMITLESS, you must. It's amazing!!! So, just to sum this up, please don't waste your time and money watching this movie... you don't even get to see a bare butt :)
B0002XMF5S|5.0|After the \\"Born Again\\" tour ended, Ian Gillan and Bev Bevan took off, leaving Tony Iommi and Geezer Butler yet again in a bad spot, needing to rebuild their band, Black Sabbath. An attempt was made in 84 with the return of Bill Ward, and new-comer vocalist David Donato, but that lasted only for a few photo shoots, and maybe a couple of rehearsals before falling apart. Then in 85 the original Black Sabbath reunited for \\"Live Aid\\", and there were rumors of them reuniting for good. Thank God that didn't happen!<br /><br />Iommi and Butler branched off (or one could say that Butler left Sabbath, and that's the way I see it) to do solo projects. However, Sabbath still owed WB Records a 'Black Sabbath' record, plus WB execs, after hearing what Iommi had recorded with bassist Dave \\"The Beast\\" Spitz, drummer Eric Singer, and vocalist Glenn Hughes (one-time bassist/vocalist for Deep Purple), they urged Iommi to release it under the Black Sabbath name. Something that he would have been a fool not to have done! I've just always hated the 'featuring Tony Iommi' part under the Sabbath name. It was (and still is) a 'catch-22' situation: If it would have been released as a Tony Iommi solo album, critics and fans alike would have bashed it, calling it a Sabbath knock-off, and released as a Sabbath album, it was bashed for not being released as a solo album.<br /><br />However, the album did pretty well, and Sabbath were born again yet again! Opening with the fierce and heavy and fast \\"In For the Kill\\", they let you know from the get go they are back with a vengeance. From the start I was hooked immediately. It took me a while to get used to the whole new 'double bass drum' sound of \\"Turn to Stone\\", love the title track, have been back and forth on \\"Danger Zone\\", and the rest I love as well. The ballad \\"No Stranger To Love\\" reminds me a LOT of earlier Sabbath 'ballads' like \\"You Won't Change Me\\", \\"Changes\\", \\"Solitude\\", et al, even though it is a bit more radio-friendly.<br /><br />Drummer Eric Singer should not only be credited for being one of the greatest drummers in rock (then unknown, stolen from the Lita Ford band, but to go on to working with the likes of Alice Cooper and KISS), but for introducing Sabbath fans to the double bass drum kit sound in the confines of Sabbath. Yes, Bill Ward had a double bass kit, but he was (and still is) a King of the Single Bass, as is Vinnie Appice. The already mentioned \\"In For The Kill\\" and \\"Turn To Stone\\" are solid rockers that are furthered along with Eric's mean kick a** drumming.<br /><br />But, the real treat on this album (if those weren't good enough) are the very bluesy numbers \\"Heart Like A Wheel\\", \\"Angry Heart\\", \\"Danger Zone\\", and \\"In Memory\\" (and the already mentioned \\"No Stranger To Love\\"). This is the blues like only Iommi and Sabbath could play it (and remember, Black Sabbath were a blues group from the outset). Very haunting riffs blended with Hughes' unique soulful blues voice just brings this album to life!<br /><br />And, if that's all not good enough, there is a real great 'mystic' track on here! An instrumental called \\"Sphinx (The Guardian)\\" blends into the title track for one of the best Black Sabbath songs since \\"Heaven And Hell\\" and/or \\"Lonely Is the Word\\" from the \\"Heaven And Hell\\" album.<br /><br />Personally, I am SO glad that this was released as a Black Sabbath cd instead of an Iommi solo project, for if it had been released back then as an Iommi solo project, not only would it have been slammed for already said reasons, but it would have ended up in the same cut-out bins with Jimmy Page's \\"Outrider\\". Does anyone remember that one??? It was actually pretty good. Page should have taken a cue from Iommi and tried calling that a Zep record, and maybe it would still be talked about to this day like \\"Seventh Star\\" is...Then again, maybe not, because this has withstood the test of time because it is great music from a great band.<br /><br />And, this set live was phenomenal! Even though Glenn was fired after only 5 days on the road and the AWESOME Ray Gillen was brought in to replace him, it was a great year for Sabbath live! This version of the band was AWESOME live! They definitely deserved to be called Black Sabbath! So, if for only that, I am so glad this was released as a Sabbath album, for it helped keep them going on through the 90's. Thank you. :>)d and the AWESOME Ray Gillen was brought in to replace him, it was a great year for Sabbath live! This version of the band was AWESOME live!

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I couldn't help but notice, the idea for this book is very similar to the Japanese film Battle Royale (where children are forced to an island to kill each other off for population control, and the victor gets to return home).   That aside, the book definitely seems to be written for an adolescent audience, but it is still an entertaining read.  I finished it in a day.  I'll probably read the other 2 books in the trilogy, just to see where they take the storyline.    Overall:  It's worth spending the roughly $5 and taking an afternoon to read it.  Don't expect to be blown away, but it's entertaining enough.
B000002KDS|5.0|It is a great album (CD).  It brings back lots of memories.  Alice Cooper has always been one of my favorites.
B001HN6918|4.0|I would give this movie 3.5 stars, if that were an option. I didn't think it was as good as the first and it was way too much fighting and kung fu. I think it should've been more of a story and kung fu, which it was but the frist was all story combined with kung fu. It's about how Po, now the dragon warrior, is doing lots of fighting but he wonders where he came from. If you saw the first you might like the second, or like me you might rather just stick with the first.

B0011UBDTK|2.0|Please read before making purchase!!!   So like many others, I also had problems with the dvds not playing properly, some episodes wouldn't play at all...especially on the season 3 discs (So even though it may be a pain, make sure you test the dvds when you get them, so you're not stuck with dvds that don't work....I would start with season 2 & 3 since they seem to be the most problematic). So I sent back to Amazon, who apologized and sent me another set, well the same exact thing happened. I checked the back of the dvds to make sure they weren't damaged, which they weren't, so I decided to try using my computer to see if they would play...and sure enough, they did. So then I tried putting them in an old, cheap dvd player that we never used and sure enough they worked on that one too. For some reason though, they won't work right on our newer sony bluray/dvd player. The only thing I can think of, is that maybe some of the newer players don't correspond to the formatting of how the show is copied over onto the dvd's??? Anyways, I ended up sending the set back to Amazon for a refund and decided to purchase the Sex and the City: Complete Series (DELUXE Edition....the one in the white leather case) because it was a newer release (2010) and I thought that maybe because of that, it would play properly in my bluray player. And sure enough, they played absolutely perfect!! I was so happy and relieved that I finally got working dvds. The drawbacks are that the Deluxe version is more expensive and the way the dvds are packaged in this set are alittle difficult to remove, but not impossible and despite what some of the reviews say about the Deluxe set, the holders don't scratch the dvds when you pull them out as long as your not being overly agressive with them. Plus, the holders do loosen up a bit after awhile. So I can say that I'm more than happy with the Deluxe set and it was well worth it to me to spend alittle more, plus the packaging of the deluxe set is so much nicer.So my suggestion to those who would like to own this set, is try out this version first and if it doesn't play right on your player, spring for the Deluxe Edition. Amazon is really great with exchanges/refunds if you do need to send things back....just as long as you're in the 30 day refund period. Good luck, I hope this review was helpful and enjoy the show, because Sex and the City is an awesome show!

B000G8NXYG|5.0|A Masterpiece by Akira Kurosawa. 1954.<br />A film that has influenced several others for more than four decades.<br />It has inspired films like 'The Magnificent Seven' and Hindi blockbusters like `Sholay' and `China Gate'.<br />Many filmmakers use this as a study film.<br />Kurosawa mesmerises and tells a great story.<br />It is about 205 minutes long and each frame is a worthwhile one.<br />It offers a master lesson in how to pace an epic tale.<br />The story takes place in a sixteenth century village in Japan that is regularly attacked by bandits. The Samurai are hired by the village elders to shield them against the bandits. The cast is led admirably by Takashi Shimura who turns out a remarkable performance. It deserved a best actor oscar without any doubt. Hollywood has not recognised this film as much as it deserved. Toshiro Mifune has also turned out a brilliant support performance. The visuals are excellent, especially the one scene focusing on a bowl of rice and rice dumplings to drive home the value that a bowl of rice had for the Samurai. This was their price for the battle they were going to wage. The Samurai come off as a selfless lot who sacrifice themselves for the cause of the farmers. The final scenes shot in the rain are superlative.<br />The film won a Silver Lion at the Venice Film Festival in 1954.  It deserved  much more than this. The jury at the film festivals have their ears and eyes plugged with weeds sometimes. They can't see a gem versus a knick knack.<br />Kurosawa made four Samurai classics - The Sevemn Samurai, the Hidden Fortress, Yojimbo and Sanjuro. I have to see his another classic `Rashomon' yet.<br />The music by Fumio Hayasaka is haunting and outstanding. It is a superb and distinct score.<br />This film is cinematic perfection and one of the best films ever made.<br />It was voted by `Sight and Sound' as one of the ten greatest films of all time.<br />I rate it AAAA.

B004HZYHGM|4.0|Combined score: 3 stars for the source text, 5 stars for Kent David Kelly's STELLAR Kindle Master Edition.<br /><br />The story itself is largely unexceptional, yet still worth reading just for how much it's influenced every pirate story since.  The peg-leg, the parrot, the island, the mutiny - so many elements found in every other piratical tale can first be found here.  The telling is sometimes interesting, sometimes functional, and has an oddly sedate tone for a supposed adventure story; the pace is in general much slower than a modern reader might expect, or be satisfied with.<br /><br />That said, the edition assembled here should be reviewed by every single publisher of ebooks ever.  The main story is well-formatted and free of errors.  Illustrations throughout come from multiple sources, both black-and-white drawings and fully painted scenes (making the Kindle, ironically, not the ideal device to read it upon).  Finally, the supplements are a veritable treasure trove of extras: Robert Louis Stevenson's metafictional vignette \\"The Persons of the Tale\\", author biography, list of characters, a timeline of the novel's events, chapter-by-chapter endnotes, various articles and essays, and much much more.<br /><br />Kent David Kelly has discussed his irritation with how the rise of ebooks has led to shovelware epublishers, who flood the market with badly-made classics.  Anyone who has scoured through multiple versions of a classic, only to find none to be at all acceptable, can understand his ire.  In such a context, the hard work and passion that has clearly gone into this work is awe-inspiring, and gladly appreciated.  For that reason alone, I'll be buying every new Kindle Master Edition he puts together, and will eagerly await each new release.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|In retrospect, one sees some of key players in global economic meltdown of 2008 in slightly different light; for example, Sec.of Treasury Paulson looks increasing unhinged -- if not deranged -- by end of last Bush term. But viewing current reality of US 'financial services sector' & banking industry -- and deregulation --proves far more horrific.   \\"Inside Job\\" (filmed in mid-2010) reveals a sad truth: the more things CHANGE in Obama administration, the more they stay the same. Not one banker, for instance, has faced criminal charges since he took office.  Moreover, Matt Damon (narrator) takes us into Academia, asking tough questions of economic professors, who often double as pricy hired guns on corporate Boards & off-shore Chamber of Commerce projects about conflicts of interest. As such,   these \\"business experts\\" promote the same devastating deregulation policies and executive unaccountability to the public that created this last housing Bubble.  Glad to have this well-researched and presented DVD on the shelf -- as reference of What Really Happened (and who did what) for future generations.

B0014DFCMS|5.0|Juno (drama, comedy, romance)<br />Directed by Jason Reitman<br />Starring Ellen Page, Michael Cera, Jason Bateman and J.K. Simmons<br /><br />20th Century Fox   2007   96 min   Rated PG-13   Released Apr 15, 2008<br /><br />Video:<br />Video codec: MPEG-4 AVC<br />Video resolution: 1080p<br />Aspect ratio: 1.85:1<br /><br />Audio:<br />English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />English: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />French: Dolby Digital 5.1<br />Spanish: Dolby Digital 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles:<br />English SDH, Spanish<br /><br />Disc:<br />50GB Blu-ray Disc<br />Digital copy<br /><br />The Film 5/5<br /><br />Juno was nominated for four Oscars, winning for best original screenplay (Diablo Cody). It was a competitive year with No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood dividing six of the major categories between them, but Ellen Page was unlucky not to win in her category. Shot on a budget of $7.5 million, it made $143 million in the USA alone and a further $88 million worldwide.<br /><br />Director Jason Reitman was also responsible for Up in the Air in 2009, which, along with Juno, dealt with subjects in which I had very little interest. But Reitman's mix of drama and comedy works well in both movies and the witty dialogue drives both.<br /><br />Juno is funny throughout, but it's never dumb comedy and it never resorts to gross humor. The story works because we care about the characters and their one-liners fit both their personality and the situation. In short, it feels real. Many comedies assault the viewer with a stream of contrived jokes and it falls flat (for me at least).<br /><br />Juno MacGuff (Page) is 16 and newly-pregnant. We are shown a flashback showing how it happened and who the father is. It turns out to be one of her best friends, Paulie Bleeker (Cera). After telling him, she decides that an abortion is the best course of action, but she changes her mind following a visit to the clinic. She's a smart girl and feels capable of making her own decisions, eventually deciding that adoption may be the best thing for her and the baby.<br /><br />She finds potential parents in an ad and then has the task of telling her father (Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney) that she's pregnant. This is where the movie first defies our expectations. Instead of anger and shock, her parents are calm and accepting. They even joke about the situation when she reveals the father. It's so refreshing to see supportive parents rather than the usual stereotypes.<br /><br />Her father wants to go with her to meet the prospective foster parents, Vanessa (Jennifer Garner) and Mark (Bateman). Vanessa desperately wants a baby and is skeptical that Juno will honor the agreement, while Mark is more relaxed about everything. He bonds with Juno when she sees his guitar and they end up singing together.<br /><br />Juno keeps in touch with the couple and forms a friendship with Mark because of their common love of music and movies. I particularly like this sequence because I'm passionate about both subjects and know the power of sharing and talking about such things. It's the main reason that I write about movies. Mark introduces her to Sonic Youth (my favorite band) and Juno shares some of her classic rock and punk albums. It seems that the two might enter into a more serious relationship.<br /><br />Her stepmother teaches her about food supplements and defends Juno when she goes to the hospital and is insulted by the ultrasound technician. It's further evidence that she'll be supported in her choices all the way.<br /><br />Bleeker's face lights up every time he sees Juno. Cera plays the part well and doesn't go over the top. It's a quiet and understated performance, but he makes it clear that she's special to him. She suggests that he date a different girl, but is angry when he does. The two have a showdown and it again becomes clear that they really feel something for each other.<br /><br />There's a touching scene in the shopping mall where Juno encounters Vanessa and sees her playing with a little girl. We see Juno forming the opinion that Vanessa will make a good mother. The scene develops with a meeting between the two in which Vanessa talks to Juno's belly.<br /><br />Her arrangement with Vanessa and Mark is threatened by one occurrence and we wonder how everything will turn out. I won't reveal that here, but it's a good resolution.<br /><br />Another great scene involves a chat between father and daughter. It's a potentially life-changing talk played perfectly by Page and Simmons. It sets into motion events that shape Juno's immediate future. Simmons is so talented. If I were a writer/director, one of the first things I would do is create a starring role for Simmons. He's made his mark with supporting roles, but has so much more to offer.<br /><br />As for Page, what a remarkable talent. She carried such films as Whip It and Hard Candy, and had a major supporting role in Inception. At 24, she has most of her career ahead of her and I'm excited to see how she develops. She's already capable of showing so much emotion and her comic timing is perfect. It will be fun to see what happens over the next decade.<br /><br />One important component of the movie is the soundtrack. Kimya Dawson contributes nine of the songs in the film and they fit the mood and Juno's character perfectly. There's a well-placed Kinks song and bands such as Cat Power and Belle & Sebastian also fit the mood. The highlight is Sonic Youth covering the Carpenters' Superstar, and it's an important part of the plot.<br /><br />Juno isn't a film that will appeal to everyone. Some argue that the dialogue isn't realistic, but I found it so. Who is it aimed at? Teens? Women? Pregnant girls? Many will write it off as falling into one of those categories. That would be a shame because it has a lot more to offer. I'm a 48-year-old man and I found it utterly charming, refreshing, intelligent and genuinely funny.<br /><br />There's a chance it may upset some people because it turns a serious situation into an amusing comedy. Is it saying that it's acceptable to be pregnant at 16? How would you feel as a parent who faced a similar situation? How would you feel if you were a pregnant teen and didn't receive that kind of support and understanding from your parents? I would hope that it can be taken for what it is; a fictional situation. It's more about how the characters react to the situation than anything else.<br /><br />Video Quality 4/5<br />For such a low-budget movie, the look is surprisingly good. The transfer is clean and free from damage, colors are well-represented and detail is good in the vast majority of scenes. I can't quite justify a 4.5, but it's certainly worth a 4. Don't expect a visual feast and you should be pretty happy with the overall look.<br /><br />Audio Quality 4/5<br />Juno is a dialogue-heavy movie that's quiet for the majority of its running time, but the sound still plays an important part. The songs are presented well and when sound is called for, such as in amplified effects in the clinic waiting room, it comes across convincingly.<br /><br />Special Features 5/5<br /><br />It's rare that I watch a movie and immediately tackle all of the special features, and even rarer to watch them again on subsequent viewings. Juno is an exception. I like this world and the quality of the extras makes it worth seeing them more than once, even though they are all in standard definition.<br /><br />Commentary with Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody<br /><br />Deleted Scenes (20:23) - It would be great to see an extended version of the film at some point and most or all of these scenes would fit well.

0307887960|5.0|I purchased the book on May 4, 2011 and there really isn't enough time to give accurate results.  I read the book before I started the diet.  It's difficult to handle the first phase which is the Attack Phase and therefore you are only eating proteins.  Depending on the amount of weight you want to lose defines the number of days you will have to stay on the protein diet.  I have not reached the second phase which allows vegetables but I have lost nine pounds since starting the diet.  The book is long but worth reading because everything is explained in detail.  The hardest part for me is the exercise but I've managed to do some of them each day along with walking on the treadmill.  What is the most difficult is not eating anything except what is allowed.  I am a sweetaholic but so far I have managed to stay away from the sweets I used to eat every day.  The book explains why the diet is set up the way it is and that is \\"if you want to lose and keep it off you have to follow the directions to a tee.\\"  I would recommend this book highly to anyone that will follow the procedure.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I gave it three stars out if fairness because it seems like a great game. I'm fairly sure my first gen droid x should be capable of playing it, but they were really lazy with properly porting it over so it screws up a bit.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|i originally downloaded this from Android Marketplace. I loved the ease of reading e books with this app so much that I got a Kindle as well for the extra features. It gives me the best of everything. I am never without a book now but have no more piles of books all over. The sync between Android &amp; Kindle works flawlessly for me. Books can be archived online so I can go back &amp; read again. This is great for me because I love series fiction and sometimes forget things before the next book comes out. There is some content you can't get with the app you can with Kindle. I think maybe Amazon wants to keep a few things out of the app so people still buy Kindles. Something else that makes having both worthwhile is that Kindle is totally non glare so you can read outside but not backlit (which is easier on the eyes) while my phone has backlight so I can read in dark/dim light.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Awesome game. Almost true to the pc version. Beautiful graphics. If you have not play the original, this is a must buy.
B0037QGS0A|4.0|This movie was okay, I felt it was missing something. I love watching Julianna Moore's  different performances. One to watch!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game works great on my EVO and my boyfriend's Thunderbolt and tablet. It's enjoyable and the levels are challenging enough to keep you engaged but not enough to frustrate you too badly.
B004XUD762|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS VERY ENTERTAINING AND IT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD. THE SONG REMAINS NOT THE SAME BY BLACK LABEL SOCIETY BRINGS YOU BACK TO YOUR SENCES AND HELPS YOU REMEMBER WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT. THIS ALBUM IS REALLY COOL TO LISTEN TO WHEN YOUR FISHING.....
B004UIOUHC|1.0|Will not install. Not enough info in the description on what minimum version of Android you need. The one star is for Amazon waisting my time.
0596522347|5.0|This book was a good place to start in preparing Powerpoint or Smart Board presentations. Great ideas and concepts. It's not a how-to manual, but more general concepts. Worth it if you can get it used.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|I have been searching for some over-the-ear head phones and read reviews on MANY headphone them came across these marshals both from amazon and cnet. After reviewing positive reviews for the $100 range I decided to buy them. NO REGRETS! I love a wide variety of music and it sounds great on all! Have owned these For a couple months now and still in great condition! Sound is impeccable but I only gave it 4 stars because of the comfort level after several hours of wearing the headphones. the headphones are a great snug fit over your ears but after several hours of having them over your ears, soreness develops. I travel a lot and spend many hours on the road so I have these on hours at a time. I'm not sure if they will wear in after a while but it's snug fit can get to you. I have to give em a rest after long use but I still highly recommend these headphones!
B000002VCW|5.0|Can't find my Albums so I have been buying CDs of some of my favorites.  Always loved this Album. The more I hear it, the more I enjoy it.  The Piano intro on \\"Year of the Cat\\" is classic.  The lyrics are fantastic and the music is masterful....The Sax is great.    Al Stewart is so underrated....and to think Madonna and Prince have made millions with that mediocre music .
B0050XFY4O|5.0|A very unique and well told story. The screenplay, actors, directing style and editing come together to effectively convey the seriousness of the story and depth of its characters, without judgment. It's great to watch a movie that's original i.e. unpredictable, that doesn't rely on archetypes or a tragic ending to show how rich love can be. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this and will recommend it.
B004GYNPL2|1.0|apps should at least LOOK like someone put some time and effort  into creating them. This one looks like a s school homework project.   Every thing is so basic, underdesigned, ugly.  I got it for free. The idea that they charge $5 for this big nothing is outrageous. Apple would have never allowed such app in their store. Maybe android should learn some quality control from them.
B004EPYZU8|1.0|I went to see this with my two teen daughters (17 and 14).  We often love the movies the critics hate.  We love action, graphics, and movies that keep moving and don't always have to make you think or cry.  That said, this was the absolute worst movie I recall ever seeing.  It was simply too weird to explain.  I wanted to love the action parts, but the action made no sense since it was all in  her head while she was dancing?   This was the first movie that all 3 of us walked out of hating.  To this day I have a sense of confusion feeling when I even think about it.
B000K2NDPM|4.0|As a university teacher I am forever telling my students to \\"Define your terms.\\" Before any Literary  work can be fully judged and evaluated a clear and binding set of parameters must be established; benchmarks against which the piece in question can be compared, contrasted and most importantly evaluated. If no terms are defined, and no frame of reference draw or defined, then there is no way we can evaluate writing, because what are we comparing it to?<br /><br />My problem therefore with this book, is how to evaluate it. What is it? What does it want to be judged as? Where should we put it in the library? Amongst whose company should it sit? These are very fundamental questions that require unambiguous answers if we are to set about processing this work as it clearly deserves to be processed. Whilst I understand this work to be Herr's catharsis, on a more practical level is it a novel? a memoir? a historical document? Is it fiction? non-fiction? Is it journalism? war correspondence? Maybe I could set it in one of these boxes, but it would not sit comfortably in a single one. And the one I might elect might not be the same one Herr would wish it to be read as. It's rather akin to a person of mixed ethnicity going through immigration and not knowing which is the better of the boxes to tick - there being  no one that correctly denotes their ethnicity. All of this confusion does not really allow the Work to be fully appreciated and accurately processed and as I tell my students who don't define their terms correctly, whilst I CAN read your submission -  because I can't accurately appraise it,  your score will suffer as a consequence.<br /><br />To the work:<br /><br />There is no doubt that this is an important piece of social and cultural heritage which undoubtedly adds to the Historical Record for the latter half of the 1960s. However, because it is so clearly a period-piece it suffers somewhat from both its tone and use of language and this is something that makes it difficult reading. Linguistically, the '60s was a fascinating period which gave brief rise to a wealth of youth-driven modes of communication and an abundance of periodic vocabulary. Fortunately (or unfortunately) when the door was closed on flower-power etc. linguistics returned to normal. This work therefore, and the language contained within the prose often reads akin to Shakespeare and therefore requires additional commentary to clarify and contextualize the somewhat dated language.<br /><br />As per the previous point and comments made by other reviewers, this work is a hard slog. Due in part to the aforementioned dated linguistics, and due in part to the 'Gonzo' style of rendering, Herr really does make you take a machete and hack your way through the terrain. Certainly before it lets up in the Fifth Act 'Colleagues' the reader is right there with the action, not necessarily the physical 'blood-and-guts', but rather the spiritual, the metaphysical, the psychological and the ontological.<br /><br />In summation:<br /><br />This is a very fascinating period-piece and a bona-fide part of the Historical Record. It should be read as part of a wider trawl through the unprecedented volume Literature that both the '60s and the Viet Nam War gave rise to. Viewed as a historical document set in the linguistic form of the late '60s 'Counter-Culture', this text works admirable and justifies its longevity and abundant praise.

B004EPYZUI|1.0|Sucker Punch was as interesting as watching your brother play Wii for two hours.    I'm a fan of Zack Snyder as a director, but as a writer he seems to suffer from M. Night Shyamalanism- that is, he's so enamoured of his own notions that he doesn't stop to ask if they make sense and fit together in a compelling and worthwhile story.      I'm also a fan of cotton candy and other things that are pretty and fun and mostly empty.  But even cotton candy can be chewed, and even mindless entertainment is still supposed to be entertaining.  I'll wait for Snyder's next effort, I just hope he pairs his remarkable visual aesthetic with a real story.
B001ECPJZO|5.0|Bit smaller than I thought it would be for little hands. Overall sturdy product, great educationally, good bright colours. Always recommend Plan Toys, fantastic products all round.
B004G5ZY7E|2.0|First, if I dont like a book, I normally stop reading it. I read this cover-to-cover in two days. Good storytelling and good pacing and I like getting the perspective from Scandinavia (interesting since I am American). But overall, it was the same old serial killer stuff. The most realistic thing about the killings is that they always take place in frozen Scandinavia where there are less witnesses. My second big problem is with the treatment of women as sex objects and esp as promiscuous sex objects. Could we have a serial killer who isn't (spoiler alert...here it comes...) out to kill the whores??
B004CLYKLI|4.0|I resisted reading this book for a bit because I didn't like many of the reviews I had read about it in magazines and newspapers.  A friend, who is a very down to earth mom, mentioned that she read it and loved it.  I gave it a shot.      It is a quick read and not beautifully written--I honestly did think that it would be, given that the author touts all the education that the she has had.  Aside from that, I thought the story to be tenderhearted at it's core.  Amy Chau is a mom who loves her kids and tries to do right by them.  When she sees that she's not, she pushes harder.  When that doesn't work, she adjusts again but in a very different way.    I did not love all the comparisons to western parenting and Chinese parenting.  The bottom line is that being a mom is being a mom.  She never comes right out and says that but her story conveys that message.  I think all of the comparing she does takes away from what she, and all moms do when their kids are young--make decisions for your kids.  She doesn't stop doing that soon enough and pays a price.   All moms go through that at some point--Chinese, western or otherwise.
B003C1QIO6|4.0|I discovered Jack Johnson one week ago while listening to Pandora Radio. I have to say that I'm thrilled for having found him. Jack Johnson is one of the two artists to have emerged post 2000 that I actually like. This album is filled with both \\"hits\\" and \\"misses,\\" but it certainly has more of the former than the latter. Many loyal fans have strongly criticized Johnson for this album, saying that he's abandoned his \\"bare\\" sound for a more produced one. While this may be true, he sounds great! Jack Johnson is clearly expanding his artistic style, and he's doing a great job at it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Stunning. Visual. Dramatic.  This book engages you with the same visceral appeal as The Lottery yet it draws you in and makes it real to you. The Hunger Games could almost seem to be happening to us, in real time.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me and I had the sample for a long time before I read it. Instantly I was hooked. This is a bonafide thriller with a genuine look at social mores, political intrique and human passions.<br /><br />Very well written and I'm off to book two!

B0036S4C6G|5.0|I have loved all of Jennifer Egan's books. I really enjoyed how all of the characters linked to others in A Visit from the Goon Squad, despite there being no storyline to pull them together, other than these connections.  It reminded me of Let the Great World Spin.  I found, however, that I enjoyed Egan's book to have less obvious connections than McCann's.  Let the Great World Spin's story lines are more raw and emotional--and I loved that aspect--plus the storyline really did flow between the characters.  Egan's talent lies in developing a character that can grab you and pull you in quickly.  The stories are interesting, too, but I loved each of the characters and found myself want to read more snippets from their lives.      The power point presentation chapter is difficult to read on a first generation Kindle so I switched to my iphone and that worked when I enlarged the screen.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|First of all this an incredibly addiciting game to play on my Galaxy S 4G. Levels are so much fun to play and it makes me want more everytime I play. The problems I have with it are more technical. For some reason if anything comes to my phone (phone calls,  texts, emails,  etc.) the game REALLY slows almost to the point that it becomes unplayable. When I go to check whatever made my phone vibrate it doesn't show up anywhere.  If it weren't for this problem I would give it 5 stars.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|First, I will say that I am not one to get overly upset with the alterations to character history. So long as the essence of the character remains true I think fans need to be (somewhat) open minded. That is to say, I don't want to see Batman pointlessly using guns or Spider-man being carefree without the underlying burden of his great responsibility, etc. Changing timelines or events can be seen as eXcusable if it allows a more cohesive story. So leaving all eXpectations other than core character traits at the door what can one eXpect from the latest X-men film?     It's become quite difficult to give honest reviews of these (comic book) films. The problem is that so many have been bombarded at us in the last decade, many from the same franchise's, that it has become difficult for any individual film to be judged on its own. Comparisons become unavoidable.     X-men (2000) was a new experience when it first arrived, it had its flaws, but before then nobody had seen a large budget attempt at an ensemble cast superhero movie. It stood out in that regard as a first attempt. Now there is no first attempt eXcuse, people start to judge these films more harshly because they eXpect the filmmakers to learn from previous attempts. That said, X-men: First Class IS a good film.     Further, if you ignore highly regarded comic book movies such as X2, Spider-man 2 and The Dark Knight, this film is eXcellent as a comic book movie. Especially if viewed as a first entry in a new series. It can only be said to suffer the same issues that all first entries in these franchises do - it has too much to do for any of it to feel completely natural and we aren't entirely used to the version of the world being presented yet.     In an attempt to counteract these usual issues the CIA is used as an easy way to explain certain otherwise difficult to explain plot points. They want to keep the story moving and have limited runtime, understood, but it took getting used to for me to accept that Charles and Eric were basically given Cerebro and the Blackbird already built (even if here it is Beast who designed them).     Also, Mystique meeting Charles plays somewhat expository, along the same line there are several other moments that can be said to be shoved in simply because they need to happen, but they are telling so much story with so many new characters that these issues are largely forgiven.     The largest fault anyone could find in this film is that Charles and Eric were played so well anyone would wish for more scenes with them and exploring their friendship, especially given that this was the one film they had a chance to do so before certain events unfolded.     In the POSITIVES (which do outway any negatives), Eric and Charles are played so incredibly well. Fassbender in particular helps one see how this film could easily have been Origins: Magneto while McAvoy brings a welcomed boyish charm to Xavier (though I would have loved to see more of the character's motivations explained or explored by the script). All the actors playing the first class are perfectly cast in their roles. The powers are showcased nicely and action is found throughout in original set pieces that feel fresh. CGI is well done and at least isn't as heavily relied on as say Origins Wolverine. They tell an epic story and the sixties setting helps the film amazingly, JFK clips are used seamlessly to aid in this (Vaughn says he wants the sequel to open with the JFK assassination). What really sells this film is the amazing story that the events are all tied around. There are also some genuine good laughs and many in-jokes that don't detract from story at all.     The final set piece is where the film really reaches its best moments, despite any arguable missteps in getting there, it truly grips the audience member/X-fan and all the pieces come into play for what has to happen in the most terrific and the most tragic of ways (despite Mystique's growth being rushed). The final moments of that set piece are indeed the film truly living its full potential in rebooting this franchise.     Overall I give it 4.5 stars as a comic book movie and 4 stars as a film on its own. I want to leave room for the promise of a much improved sequel. It is undoubtedly one of the better comic book movies that will come out this summer (if not the best) and attempts admirable depth for a summer blockbuster, despite not quite finding that \\"place between rage and serenity\\" (as Charles tells Eric). Get out there and see it if you are a fan, it's worlds better than the cluster of plots that bogged down both X3 and X-men Origins: Wolverine. Lastly and most importantly, THIS FILM IS FUN!
B00521LT8O|5.0|I Love the series.  I could not possibly love it more and whoever said that about looking for 'alternative' ways of watching it could not be more right.  I'm an extremely loyal Amazon customer and I will purchase the missing episodes.   But---just so anyone who wants to knows: my oh my those 2 missing ones are SOOOOO good!  Especially the last one!  I cried and jumped for joy!  Can't wait to see it again!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Definately worth the memory space and download time.  The game has ported to Droid very nicely with excellent touch screen interaction, high end mobile graphics, and sounds.  The game goes to and rom standby well.  Does eat battery life but that is expected for such an interactive game.  I highly recommend it.

B004ACAELE|5.0|As with the other books I've read by Stieg Larsson, this one was hard to put down. He has a knack for making the most implausible characters seem plausible and holds your attention through 700 plus pages with twists and turns that keep you turning to read more. It's sad to know there will be no more by this incredible author.

B000002JSN|3.0|If Led Zeppelin needed a double album to release Kashmir, so be it. Kashmir is so splendid, so stunningly beautiful, that it's worth the uneven (from mediocre to bad and very wrong) entourage. But not all the other songs are a disaster -- some have their moments of greatness:     - Ten Years Gone's second part (starting from 3:21) is incredibly soulful, Page's epic guitar melting to perfection with Plant's meditative, longing vocals.      - Bron-Yr-Aur is delicate and intuitive, a musical filigree.    - Boogie with Stu is really fun and cheerful.     - Trampled Underfoot would be perfect without the clavinet riff (ripped off from Stevie Wonder's Superstition) which sounds so artificial here and gives the impression of patch work; why did they embarrassed themselves--twice??    - Night Flight has a nice, accessible tune and interesting tempo changes.    - Houses of the Holy would be wonderful without Plant's voice. Matter of fact, many Led Zeppelin songs would be much better without Plants's voice...     In fact, it's not really Plant's voice the problem here, but what he does with it: his shrieking, screeching, howling and bowling are brain-scraping and overbearing. And he tormented his voice so hard and for so long that he eventually broke it.    As for the (dumb) lyrics, I'm not going to make a fuss: rockers do not need to be--and usually are not--poets. The times of the troubadours are gone long ago.

B004LQ1XBY|4.0|Why the $39.99 price tag for \\"Let Them Talk\\"?when you can buy the new \\"Crossroads\\" cd (Blu-Ray)for $25.99 or the new Dr.john cd for under $10.00.It just seems excessive for a new artists cd.I can buy the complete first series DVD of \\"Treme\\" for under $39.99.I know Hugh Laurie is well known as an actor but has yet to prove himself as a blues artist.I watched your video clip about the making of the cd and it sounds great,he sings and plays well but i will be waiting until \\"Let Them Talk\\" is selling for around the $10-$15 mark before I buy it.Thank you.(Review update June 18th June.I see the price for \\"Let Them Talk\\" is now $10.40,thats more like it.The price on June 4th was $39.99 which was obviously a mistake,I'll now order a copy,Brilliant!)

B001UV4XFG|5.0|I came into the whole Twilight scene a little late. Even though I was constantly hearing about team Jacob and team Edward it wasn't until well after New Moon was out that I even bothered to watch Twilight and what can I say, except, I am now a fan and had to purchase each saga.  Eclipse was well worth the purchase, I purchased it through Amazon and got it for a good price.  I haven't yet gone through all of the special features, but the movie alone was great.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|This is a great television series, one of my favorite shows ever. If you are at all into films like 300 and Gladiator then you MUST see this. The show itself is easily 5 stars. The problem with the box set I have is that instead of plastic casing or the plastic snap in foldouts like im used to seeing in box sets, Spartacus opted to go with a smaller packaging using cardboard slip sleeves for the disc storage instead. The problem with this is that you add more and more scratches and scuffs to your disks each time you take them out and put them back in. For most people this will be fine as i doubt they would watch it enough times to scratch the disks to the point of bein unplayable. As a collector however, delivering packaging that makes it literally impossible to keep the product in mint condition is irritating to say the least.
0312600844|3.0|I really liked the writing style and the character development, but the interpersonal relationships were so negative that it was adversely affecting me to keep reading. I stopped halfway through.
0743496736|1.0|Prior to reading Nineteen Minutes I had picked up another one of Picoult's novels, The Pact. After struggling through about 200 pages I set that book down, never to return to it again, and it remains to this day the only book I never finished. Due to that, I was hesitant at first to read this novel, even after I had received a great recommendation for it. I have to admit that until I reached the end of the novel I would have recommended this book to another person; yet, after reaching the twist at the end of the novel, that received little to no pages uncovering it further, I realized that through my knowledge of the novel itself and my feelings toward Picoult's other novel, the Pact, I should have expected the ending I received. To start, I was tricked by a plot that appears to be forever unraveling, but I warn any person who feels they may be interested in this book that the entire novel, approaching the ending, is exactly that, a trick. After reaching the twist at the end of the novel any reader can find themselves realizing that all Picoult did was come up with a story line that she felt compelled to add a \\"soap opera ending\\" to, which in turn obliterated the work as a whole. Upon reaching the twist I found myself shocked that the book ended in approximately 20 pages after. Picoult introduced this twist and then ended the novel with a nearly picture perfect ending *spoiler* of Alex being pregnant with Patricks baby, as if to say, \\"look at me! I managed to change the whole story around and end the book perfectly in approximately 20 pages!\\" I was completely infuriated that not only did she twist the entire plot and fall through on its elaboration, but she ended the novel in nearly the cheesiest way possible.   Also, some other minor comments. Picoult's understanding of high school is stereotyped to the ultimate. I graduated high school last week and can say with 100% confidence that the way high school is depicted in this novel is completely taken over the top. Yes, high school has cliques, but they ARE NOT as Picoult depicts them. Cliques are present because people flock toward those who are like them, which is what people need in high school; therefore, they are not so much a cut throat food chain as she describes, but a part of human nature that exists even outside of high schools. Picoult makes high school appear far more dramatic than it actually is. While she does focus on the issue of bullying , which is something people need to be aware of - as I studied it partially in my senior project-, Picoult's portrayal of it is disturbingly uneducated. If she wanted to communicate a message, it would have been better sought through focusing less on stereotypes and on more realistic accounts. Lastly, I understand that DAs (prosecution) and defense attorneys are often portrayed as childish, but Pilcoult took it to an unprofessional, unrealistic level, where Jordan and Diana felt like two kids arguing. While this might have been an underlying dig at the legal system, it was on Picoult's part flat out rude to show these two individuals the way she did. Ultimately, I felt let down by this book more than I did The Pact, and I would not recommend it, but I would recommend to one who is interested in school shootings to read actual accounts of such events, as well as studies. However, if books that do not have sufficient endings that also take reality past reality interest you, go ahead and read this book.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|Sometimes comic book movies don't take the hint.  Superman should have stopped after two.  The original Batman movies should have stopped after one.  The Fantastic Four should have stopped the minute Jessica Alba was cast.  But leave it to X-Men to finally get it right after 5 tries.<br /><br />Not that the first four movies were bad.  X-Men 1 and 2 are actually decent.  Wolverine is campy, but still fun.  X-Men 3 barely survives Kelsey Grammer in a fuzzy blue gorilla suit.  But X-Men First Class is in a, uh, category of its own.<br /><br />There are a few reasons why it works so well.  Good action, fun characters, jokes, a couple awesome cameos.  But I think the biggest reason is that it is set in the 60s.  No Austin Powers here (though January Jones as Emma Frost does a pretty great impression of a Fem-bot).  This is Cold War all the way.  This can lead to some anachronistic moments.  After leaving their cutting edge genetics lab on a futuristic hover jet, the X-Men are forced to watch JFK give updates on a static black-and-white television.<br /><br />Still, it's awesome to have a real president overseeing these things for once.  Using the Cuban Missile Crisis as a backdrop, the filmmakers recast a chess match between superpowers as a chess match between super powers.  The U.S.A. and the U.S.S.R. may have their differences, but pretty much everyone agrees that Kevin Bacon is pure evil.<br /><br />Bacon plays the mutant villain Sebastian Shaw, whose main super power is that he can link himself to any movie actor in six movies or less.  He can also absorb energy.  This makes him pretty much unstoppable, except for one weak point, and it has nothing to do with his bushy sideburns (Kevin Bacon can rock smarmy facial hair like nobody's business).  It's up to Magneto and Professor X to find his Achilles Heel and exploit it.<br /><br />Yes, Magneto and Professor X are a team in this movie, and while it doesn't exactly culminate with a lightsaber battle on Mustafar, you know it can't end well.  This is a far more violent movie then we're used to from X-Men.  Comic book movies tend to involve lots of action, but rarely do you grasp the damage to human life.  X-Men First Class isn't gory, but it does have some brutal murders.  Most of them involve Magneto, whose ability to rip fillings from other people's teeth and thrust knives into their chests from across the room makes him a little unsettling.  Another mutant can grab hold of average people and teleport them a mile into the sky.  Then he drops them.  This is a far cry from the horrors of Superman II, where the biggest danger was in having your bus tip over.<br /><br />There's a dark side even to the good guys, and many of the mutants are not above using their sexuality as a manipulation tactic.  Angel makes a living as an exotic dancer.  Emma Frost has no problem telepathically simulating a make-out session.  Even the non-mutant CIA officer strips down to her underwear to sneak into a nightclub.  Give Mystique some credit.  Whereas everyone just assumed that Rebecca Romijn would give her performance sans clothes, Jennifer Lawrence (as the younger version) at least feels uncomfortable walking around in full blue nakedness.  Let's face it, when even Professor X is dropping the same genetic-theme pick-up line on every hottie at the bar, you've definitely crossed into new X-Men territory.<br /><br />If the movie falters anywhere, it's in bringing back that ridiculous blue gorilla suit.  Nicholas Hoult's character undergoes a transformation from a guy with big feet to The Beast, later (earlier) played by Kelsey Grammer.  While some comic book costumes look good on screen, this one is never gonna work.  He looks like a werewolf smurf, and might better off chasing Gargamel's cat through a magical candy forest.  A better solution would have been to show the beginnings of Beast's transformation, then to have him flee the movie out of shame, which would have been entirely within character.<br /><br />All told, X-Men First Class has catapulted itself to the upper echelon of comic book movies, into the heady space occupied by Dark Knight and Iron Man.  It does make one wonder if they will quit while they're ahead.  I'd hate to see this turn into X-Men Saved by the Bell.to the upper echelon of comic book movies, into the heady space occupied by Dark Knight and Iron Man.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|So good. Its to easy to get caught up in the plot. After the whole series was watched, I definately googled to find out more about each man as the film painted them to fantastic soldiers. People want to compare this with Band of Brothers but I dont think you can. Band of Brothers was about the airborne division in Europe during world war II, this is about the war in Japan, and I was completely taken aback by this movie, because my ignorance made me always feel there was more of a war in Europe, and never realized what the soldiers in Japan were really going through as well. That being said, I wish the Pacific had more episodes to the series like Band of Brothers. Regardless, its an amazing serious. I also recommend Band of Brothers just as much. They both give two completely seperate accounts in two different places about World War II.
B004K7HMJ6|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Do it Like a Dude\\", I was hooked. After that, I heard \\"Price Tag\\" and a few other songs and I quickly loved Jessie J. She's way better than some of the others in mainstream music like Katy Perry and Ke$ha. I still like both of them, but Jessie J has more talent than the both of them combined. She's already big in her native  U.K., and I'm glad she's getting some attention in the U.S., although she's not getting too much attention, which is great. I hate when artists I love become so big that every single song goes to no. 1 on Billboard and everyone around me starts singing their songs and all the songs become really annoying and I start liking the artist a bit less. I'm glad Jessie J isn't that big that something like that would happen (Thank God cause she's amazing!) Every single song on this album is great. The beats, amazing lyrics, and production are all amazing. Even though not everybody knows her name, she still has great talent.       The album begins with the first U.S. single, \\"Price Tag\\" featuring B.o.B. I could kind of tell that this song was produced by Dr. Luke (and I was right), but unlike a lot of songs produced by him, this is actually a beat that that doesn't sound so recycled and boring. It actually sounds great. I love the reggae theme and the bass is this song. The chorus is obviously the most catchy part of this song and it's a great way to open the album. The next song is one of my favorites, \\"Nobody's Perfect\\". It has a rock influenced pop beat with violins. It has some of the best lyrics on the album, and even as she said herself, it's one of her top 3 favorite songs on the album, and I can see why. \\"Abracadabra\\" is single-worthy. It kind of has an old-school throwback sound, with an upbeat sound, piano, and, bass. The chorus is a very memorable part of the song. \\"Big White Room\\" is a live song and probably one of her most personal songs. She said the song came from when she was 10 and in the hospital (she has an irregular heartbeat), and how she saw a sick 10 year old die in the hospital. It's a really sad song. It's about 5 1/2 minutes and only has an acoustic guitar and some of her best vocals, along with clapping from the audience at times. It's one of my favorites.       I first heard \\"Casualty of Love\\" when it was just an iTunes promo single, and I loved it. It kind of reminds me of a Mariah Carey ballad, with all thos instruments. The lyrics are amazing and it's a great old-school ballad. \\"Rainbow\\" is definitely in my top 5 favorite songs on this album. The chorus is absolutely amazing and it's one of those empowerment songs with great lyrics and a nice hip-hop beat. I love it. \\"Who's Laughing Now\\" is another song that's probably personal to her. It's kind of like a middle finger to all the people that bullied her in school. It has a diverse hip-pop beat that I love. It has some of my favorite lyrics and it's another one in my top 5 favorites on the album. The next track is the first U.K. single, \\"Do It Like a Dude\\", which is amazing! I love the rock-influenced heavy hip-hop beat, and it has simple but amazing lyrics and I fell in love with the song when I first heard it. I love her Jamaican patois and accent, which is one of my favorite parts of the song. The music video is awesome, too. (She was originally going to give this song to Rihanna, and thank God she didn't. Rihanna would have compeletely ruined this song.)       \\"Mamma Knows Best\\" is the only big-band song on the album. It has loud horns and nice lyrics. This song shows some of the albums diversity. \\"L.O.V.E.\\" is a pop ballad, with a great beat and lyrics. The chorus is really a standout. It deserves a great spot on this album. \\"Stand Up\\" is an amazing song and the only song on the album that has a sample from another song. The chorus is awesome and the positive lyrics are some of my favorite. \\"I Need This\\" was a song that she wrote for Chris Brown, and I'm glad that she sung it herself and put it on this album, because it's a great pop-rock ballad. The last song on this album is by far my favorite and one of my favorite songs of all time, \\"Who You Are\\". The song is acoustic pop, that becomes really powerful at the end with the violins and amazing beat. It kind of reminds me of Christina Aguilera's \\"Beautiful\\", because this is another empowerment song, and it's really a really phenomenal way to end this amazing album.       This album deserves a standing ovation! \\"Who You Are\\" is a diverse album, showing reggae, hip-hop, pop, R&B, and big band, over lyrics that deal with love, personal experiences, and empowerment. This is one of my favorite albums of all time and I can't wait for Jessie J's next album!    My top 3 favorites:    1. Who You Are  2. Who's Laughing Now  3. Big White Room
B000XA5K4I|4.0|This film is non-stop action from beginning to end, with some of the most imaginitve stunts and action sequences that I have ever seen.  The plot, what little there is, has mysterious drifter Clive Owen attempting to save a baby from a group of mysterious hit-men led by henpecked husband and psychotic killer, Paul Giamatti.  Owen also gets his prostitute girlfriend, Monica Bellucci, involved in the action.  Owen and Giamatti are terrific.  Bellucci is a perfectly gorgeous woman and one cannot take their eyes off her when she is on camera.  The picture and sound on the blu-ray are fine.  There is a four part documentary on the making of the film and deleted scenes with commentary by the writer/director.  This film did not do particularly well in theaters and was in and out quickly.  Too bad, since this is one seriously entertaining and imaginitve action thriller.  If you like this type of film and have not seen this one, you should definitely check it out.  You won't be disappointed.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Lost is entertaining and also thought-provoking and evocative. The music, character development, beginnings and endings, separations and reunification reeled me in. The characters' emotional experiences of deep love and hate, battling good and evil within themselves and clinging to or letting go of their pasts and future mirrors the complexity of real-life relationships. Lost contains a little something from all genres: romance, espionage, mystery, sci-fiction, suspense, drama, etc. It brings to life issues of trust, betrayal, friendship, loyalty, abandonment, avoidance, worthiness, sacrifice, etc.     There was a problem with the first box set that I received, which I returned and Amazon kindly sent me a new one immediately.
0439023483|5.0|The Hunger Games was one of those books that I bought upon release, was over-hyped by everyone, and therefore went on the back-burner until my own expectations of the book would be brought down. That was three years ago and I finally (FINALLY!) decided to dust off my hardcover...And I am KICKING myself for waiting so long to read it because it was AMAZING!<br /><br />Okay, so the premise of The Hunger Games was awesome...and very creepy. You basically have 24 teens fighting each other to death for the chance to be the winner of The Hunger Games which includes a crapload or riches and such. Yeah it's vicious and I'm sure those who haven't read it can't comprehend why someone would do it. Well, it's mandatory in that they absolutely HAVE to do it or face...huh, the book never actually mentions what would happen if someone puts their foot down and decides not to go. Anyway, due to the premise, The Hunger Games was action-packed! I really didn't think that I would like an action book as much as I did. I just kept gasping, \\"Who's going to die now?! How are they going to die?!\\" See. Creepy premise that makes everyone else react creepily. However, said premise was made better by the awesomeness that was the main character.<br /><br />Katniss was a kick-ass female character! I've read a plethora of Young-Adult novels where the heroines were pathetic, ooey-gooey type of chicks (Ahem, Twilight), so I'm always weary to pick up a non-realistic YA novel fronted by a female. But, Katniss was just made of awesome. She was so bad-ass and was just as smart, strong, and ruthless as any of the men in The Hunger Games were. In fact, most of the girls in this book were like that, even the blatantly evil ones (especially the blatantly evil ones). They all want to win and will do anything to achieve that.<br /><br />Now the romance didn't make me want to stab my eyes due to the cheesiness of it all and that's the highest rating I can give it. For a romance to make me go \\"awww\\" and squee, it has to be the best romance known to man. This wasn't (and let's face it, this was a main reason why I loved it so much) and the romance wasn't all in your face (which I also liked). It was secondary to The Hunger Games. Although, let's face it, if someone was getting all cuddly during the games, I would think it was just so stupid considering that everyone should be concentrating on, you know, getting out ALIVE. But the way The Hunger Games went actually made a lot of sense.<br /><br />So, The Hunger Games was just full of win. It was an amazing novel that's making me regret putting it off for so long because I could've enjoyed this book when the rest of the world (mostly) was enjoying. Oh well. At least all of the books are out, so there isn't much of a wait to read them.romance known to man.

B004QWZ92W|4.0|I downloaded the free version of \\"Origin,\\" but got this one because it was only $2.99 and illustrated. The main reason I bought it was for the pictures because Darwin's extensive book covers so many animals and flowers that I wasn't actually sure which he was talking about for his examples. I'm not that much into botany, and am mostly familiar with either American or zoo animals so some of the Terra del Fuego or New Zealand examples were a little lost on me. This version contains over 250 pictures and illustrations that give a better understanding of the topics covered at hand. However, a great deal of the pictures were either of famous men (scientists, naturalists, etc.) and/or landscape shots. And of course, since this is a Kindle they are all in black and white, which normally wouldn't bother me (I knew what I was getting into when I ordered the Kindle, and I still love it), but most of the pictures are obviously color because the B&W contrast often makes it difficult to see the photo's subject clearly. And since so many of these pictures were not plants and animals, but people and landscapes, the whole \\"illustrated experience\\" of \\"Origin\\" is lacking. BTW, although not stated in this book, this version appears to be the Sixth Edition, which I found a little smoother to read than the free public domain First Edition of \\"Origin\\". Overall, a great purchase and well worth the price.

B00371QQ0M|5.0|L'un des meilleurs films de Science fiction à ce jour.  Très bonne qualité d'image sur Blu ray... A redécouvrir.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Viewed: 3/09, 5/11<br />Rate: 9<br /><br />3/09: One critic calls the film Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! I don't think the movie was. The first half of Tora! Tora! Tora! is boring as the sequence of events are told in matter-of-factly fashion. After the intermission, Tora! Tora! Tora! starts to pick up the pace and begins to showcase the real meat of the film which I had long been waiting for. The special effects, which won the Academy Award, are not too bad and hold up well today. Moreover, they are much more lucid and clear than the crap of today's films. When I say that, it's just so remarkable that I can actually sit back and enjoy the spectacle without getting a headache. However, the attack on Pearl Harbor as depicted through Tora! Tora! Tora! doesn't appear to be comprehensive as it should have been. Meanwhile, the cast is extremely bland, and there isn't a particular standout when it comes to praiseworthy performances. This certain element did deeply hurt one film A Bridge Too Far for having too many well-known stars which proved to be a major distraction for me. In Tora! Tora! Tora!, it is very easy for me to focus on the film for its story rather than the stars. So, a giant round of kudos to everybody who decided on this approach. Meanwhile, I like how the directors of the film opted for subtitles of characters as they are introduced, but I got disappointed when he stopped doing that after twenty minutes, only to sparingly use the technique. For so many years, I never knew what the word \\"Tora\\" meant, and now...in two-syllabic combination, it means \\"Attack\\" for \\"To\\" and \\"Torpedo attack\\" for \\"Ra.\\" Also, it means \\"Tiger.\\" Much of what I read about the Pearl Harbor attack seems to be reflected the same in Tora! Tora! Tora!, and I do remember that famous line from Admiral Yamamoto when he says, \\"I fear all we have done is to awaken the sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve.\\" This line is probably entirely false but still memorable. Watching how the U.S. military have goofed their jobs up, I find it amazing that the taxpayers had to pay so much money to them in return for proper defenses of this country. As for the direction of Tora! Tora! Tora!, I find it interesting that the film is done in parallelism: Japanese and American units. Yet there is a distinct difference of the energy level on both sides. Granted, Richard Fleischer is a notoriously tedious director who often has failed to generate any excitement in his films. The aerial scenes of the Japanese fighters in Tora! Tora! Tora! are stunning, and the displays of the American ships are really neat. The cameramen does a great job of capturing them all without losing focus. For a brief time, the lens of the camera is dirty. I don't see much of the gunshot wounds inflicted on the American soldiers, so...a bit of disappointment there. All in all, although I read that many critics found the film boring, I felt that Tora! Tora! Tora! is an extremely fair film that accurately told the story well and as how it happened just like how Thirteen Days retold the story. It may also be fair to say that Tora! Tora! Tora! could be the one of the fewest unHollywood picture that doesn't glorify the common elements that Pearl Harbor had abused to extensive lengths. Tora! Tora! Tora! is one of the really good war pictures to see because it feels very straight forward with no reliance of ballyhooed Hollywood elements which have hijacked the purpose of the film.<br /><br />5/11: Raising my rating of Tora! Tora! Tora! from `6' to `9', I still find the special effects to be particularly outstanding in a complete absence of CGI. The low-key level of casting makes the film a standard of not only World War II but any war picture. It is exactly the reason why Tora! Tora! Tora! doesn't become distracted by having hordes of big stars making their five minute cameos that add nothing of value to the overall story. Rather, the film allows the story to evolve step by step in terms of what really happened in Pearl Harbor. It is a great piece of cinema, and of course, the special effects steals the show, especially in the last half hour. Another winning feature of the film which raises the standard of war, and anything else, pictures is the idea of Japanese players to speak their own native tongue. All in all, Tora! Tora! Tora! is a great war picture that deserves to be seen and admired for its simplicity.Pearl Harbor.

B004LWZW42|5.0|Amazing.  Just goes to show that you don't need to blow all your money on famous faces, you just need talent and a good story.  I am s ready to get this on Blu Ray.  If you liked X men 1 and 2 you will like this.  I loved it.  I was so happy to see good story and story telling again in the x men franchise.
B000AGTPUA|4.0|I ordered this movie because of the 3d. I am glad it came in a 2 disc package. We found the 3d was unwatchable. I don't know if it was the cheap paper glasses We used, but the 1st mate and I after 10 minutes of the movie pulled the disc and put in the 2d disc. The picture was quite blurred and distracting. It was giving us both a head ache in 3d anaglyph. The 2d disc was enjoyable, good story line. After watching it for the first time I can see why it is a classic.

I would have easily paid for this had it not been available free app of the day.   Gameplay runs smooth on HTC Thunderbolt. I haven't noticed any issues with lag or other bugs.   I highly recommend picking this up.
0783225849|5.0|Viewed: 12/02, 6/06, 5/11<br />Rate: 10<br /><br />6/06: Psycho is an art unto itself. The film is purely Hitchcock and the quintessential Hitchcock picture. Nothing ranks a greater thrill, suspense, or paradox of a film noir than Psycho. Understandably, Psycho scared a lot of people. It's best to see Psycho with another person, if you can. The prime difference between Psycho and The Exorcist is breeding from technique for suspense. While The Exorcist may seem slightly overdone and macabre, Psycho is rather done much subtly with care in a restrained way. That is what makes Psycho so scary, not too abaxial when compared to Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Easily ranks Hitchcock's best, Psycho is one of the handful best films and one of the most important in cinema history. It's hard to think of Hitchcock without thinking of Psycho. I am gravely disappointed that the Academy Award failed to nominate Anthony Perkins for the Best Actor, let alone a win. Anthony Perkins will forever be known as Norman Bates. Oh man, Anthony Perkins was flawless in his performance....truly a tour de force. He was simply the catalyst of Psycho. The movie worked because of him. It also worked because of Alfred Hitchcock. How could he not win the award for Best Director? After forty-six years, Psycho ranks probably top two scariest films, top five most thrilling films, top fifteen best movies, and top ten film noir made. Psycho is all Hitchcock and all brilliance. There are too many beautiful shots and several landmark scenes. Without question, Psycho is a phenomenal film.<br /><br />5/11: Alfred Hitchcock gets pissed off when he loses the title Master of Suspense to Henri-Georges Clouzot after Les Diaboliques gets made, so what does he do? Go on and make a film that would become world-wide famous. Of course, fifty-one years later, Psycho is a timeless horror classic. Anyone can see it and be still frightened by the results. It's not so gruesome as it appears, but rather it is adroitly filmed enough to produce shock waves. That's why the film becomes so good for it. And that's why Alfred Hitchcock is regarded as one of the most brilliantly technical directors ever. Once again, and very shocking, Anthony Perkins never won the Oscar for his masterpiece of acting. All in all, Psycho is the film to see and best to be done so in the dark.hock waves. That's why the film becomes so good for it.

0141188626|4.0|Enjoyed reading it. Some sections of the book are very dramatic and engaging and gives goose bumps. The last 100 t0 200 pages is where philosophy kicks in and also the intense drama. Would definitely suggest anyone to read it. The reason for only four stars is because, there are some sections of the book which I did not feel gripping or may be its just me.    Can't ever forget the last line of the book. Awesome ending!!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|After hearing a few songs by Adele on the radio I purchased this CD on Amazon.ca. I haven't purchased a CD in years, as I find it a waste to buy a CD for one or two songs, but I was not disappointed. I liked all the songs on this one and I love popping this CD in , putting the top down on the car and hitting the road!

B004JN1D2I|1.0|I've owned various copies of these books, and I've certainly enjoyed reading all four of them.  This review (and the low score) has nothing to do with the quality of the writing and everything to do with the presentation.  I bought the bundle, thinking (wrongly) that it would be easier to manage on the Kindle.  Wrong. At one point I accidentally jumped ahead to the final book's table of contents, and now it keeps trying to sync to that location as the furthest point read amongst the devices I use.  And the books are pretty long (and the chapter titles aren't that distinctive), so it makes navigating fairly painful, especially if you forget to bookmark your location. Skimming through the other reviews, I see that a couple of folks have offered suggestions regarding the complaints about navigation, but I'll say that if I could do it all over again I'd buy the books individually.

1591844096|4.0|Seth Godin goes a little overboard with the \\"artist\\" term in this one, but it's otherwise an important book for people feeling they need a little juice-boost in their career.     It's about re-thinking the contribution you make to your company, regardless of the role you're in. You don't have to be in job or company or industry where you're saving lives. You don't have to be at a non-profit providing hope to those in despair or digging wells in Africa. You can find contentment and success right where you are, most likely, by taking more initiative and \\"owning\\" the projects you take on.     Find yourself in your work. Stir the pot. Get results. You'll stand out.

B004N44SOI|2.0|I heard Nikki Sixx being interviewed on the Mark and Brian show over a month ago. Nikki is a cool and awesome guy in my book. Based on this interview, I bought Sixx-AM sound unheard. I am sadly disappointed overall. While there are some great guitar hooks and musicianship in this band, I will never fully appreciate it, because I have to force myself to listen to it. This sounds like 95% of commercial hard rock out there to me, overall generic and sterile. If you are into that, then by all means, buy this disc. Unfortunately, I am not. I have listened to this CD twice all the way through, trying to give it a fair chance. I just cannot get into it, even though there are some cool riffs and hooks to be had on this record. Perhaps I am too selective in my musical tastes and have plenty of music that I would rather listen to. So after hearing a comment that Nikki Sixx made about how he thinks that Poison sucks, perhaps he should re-evaluate that statement. I could say the same about this record. (BTW, I am not a Poison fan either)
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This app is incredibly simple and very powerful. The spectrum analysis can help one in making decisions about changing wifi channels in your router. The channel list makes connecting to a variety of networks easy. It gives a lot more info than the stock wifi connector on the Android OS. The router tracer is a fun novelty item. I used it to find where the closest router was at my school. Pretty cool.<br /><br />As far as utility apps go this one is a must have. I use it frequently.
0345529057|1.0|This Author seems a bit pompous/egotistical to me.  15 Years and still no end in sight. Time magazine called him the next Americal Tolkien.  Get real.  I loved the characters in LOR. The characters in this series are killed off as fast as he creates them.  No worries though, for every dead character there are two new ones to replace. A more appropriate comparision is a Shakespeare trajedy written as a Hollywood series.  I bought the first four books but will not buy another book from this author, ever.

B004GYNPL2|1.0|This app is unpolished and generally in an immature state. The way synching works leaves users at the mercy of the developer.

0307408833|1.0|Loved the birthday cake we bought from the bakery in April. 3/5 of us in the family have celiac. Could not wait to buy and try the cookbook recipes!  I made the vanilla cupcakes and frosting today after spending a fortune on getting all the correct ingredients. Sad to say--- most disgusting thing I ever baked!! Tons of money spent between both cookbooks and the ingredients. There is no way the cookbook recipes are the same as the bakery...no way!  The texture is great and I did not have problem with icing setting up like others because I altered based on other reviews, knowing the cookbook recipe was erroneous. The taste of both is just DREADFUL!    Update:  So after some thinking and researching I decided the problem with the cupcakes is probably the bean flour in the recipe. I am going to try rice flour to see it I can get rid of the metallic/weird aftertaste I think is coming from the bean flour. I think the problem with the icing is again the main ingredient in the recipe: the soy. I am going to swap these our for rice milk and powder and hopefully the weird taste will not be there. I'll re-post after I get another free afternoon to try it out.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|Great audio, great video, what more could you ask for with a concert video!  I've already got \\"Let there be rock\\" on Amazon's pre-order, hope it's equally as good!  The audience was really into this and with all the  detailed audience shots this DVD would probably have benefited by getting the BR. When I do finally go BR this will probably be one of my first BR purchases. This DVD version was also clear, it's just you can only do so much with 480.  I do agree with some of the others about the somewhat quick edits, I also like longer shots but I've seen much worse in music videos. That doesn't make it right but it's still a great DVD.

Definitely the best tower defense game.
1579128149|5.0|I have many books on science however this is one that I cherish above all others.<br /><br />It is the first time I've been able to visually process every element clearly and with a brief description to understand what it is really like. The brevity of description is a bonus as it makes the book approachable even for a 1 minute read by a lower grade reader.<br /><br />I also like the graphs that show electron shell positions on each page and the treatment of newer understanding of electron shell shapes and organization at the front.<br /><br />There are few books which are both visually stunning, easy to dip into even for a short time and yet still manages to be interesting yet not too complicated - a difficult feat... but this one has all this.<br /><br />Absolutely the most magical book I own. A debt of thanks is owed the author for finally making the elements so easy to approach yet still detailed.

B004SCI9BS|2.0|As Amy Winehouse said, \\"What kind of F@$!ery is this?\\"    Ten years ago, they had me at Hard to Explain. Today, it's hard to explain what this album is.    I think the Strokes came and went with the time they existed in.  This is a typical \\"transition album\\" third release. I'm looking at you Portishead Third and STP Tiny Music: SFtVGS.  Where do we go from here? 80s of course.  \\"Two kinds of Happiness is a nice Tom Petty riff but the overall 80s reversion and electronic bop of the album rings hollow.  Basically the Strokes are trying to figure out a sound Vampire Weekend already has down. Where are the Strokes then?  \\"You're So Right\\" is downright annoying and i cant figure out what they were thinking with \\"Metabolism.\\"   \\"Call me Back\\" feels like light in the tunnel but only \\"Games\\" follows the uptick.  There is lots of filler here with none of the emotional center of Room on Fire or Is this It.  It simply seems as if most of these are leftovers of the years in between.  To sum this album up in one word:  FORCED.      Its cool and all for bands to expand their range and their sound, but its even better when they just keep making good music.  Move along folks, theres too much good stuff to be had to dwell on this.

0061726826|5.0|Lauren Oliver is officially my favorite author. I've never been so emotionally invested in a book as I have with first, \\"Before I Fall\\", and now \\"Delirium\\". Anyone who has ever fallen in love and knows the overwhelming flood of feelings an emotions that go along with it will relate to Lena's experiences and relive those feelings along side her as the story progresses. I can't even find a way to describe this story other than to say it's incredibly painful and beautiful at the same time, in only a way love can be. I had to re-read the last bit at the end because my eyes were so full of tears the first time. I'm so excited to hear Lena's story is becoming a trilogy and Delirium is being made into a movie. A must-read for any fan of this genre and a sucker for a love story.
B004RQVVGU|5.0|One need not be affiliated with the military to be familiar with a battle which took place in the early days of the Vietnam War. The battle of Ia Drang has been immortalized in retired General Hal G. Moore's best-selling book We Were Soldiers Once... and Young, which subsequently, Paramount made into a major motion picture. This particular battle is significant for various reasons. New concepts were tested against a new enemy, thus many \\"first\\" occurrences took place as the battle unfolded. This battle would be the first major engagement between the regular forces of the People's Army of North Vietnam or North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and U.S. ground forces. The venerable Bell UH-1D Iroquois (Huey) helicopter, the war horse of the Vietnam War, will be utilized for the first time in sustained combat operations for both troop transport and casualty evacuation. The concept of the Airmobile or Air Assault Infantryman will be put to the test for the first time against a formidable opponent. Essentially, this battle set the stage for future combat operations in the 10 year U.S. involvement in the Vietnam conflict.  The Ia Drang river valley sits just Nort East of the Chu Pong Mountain (also called Chu Pong Massif) or Hill 542 between two major rivers, the Ia Drang River to the North and the Ia Tae River to the South, both generally running from North East to South West. The Chu Pong Massif was a key strategic piece of terrain for both the North Vietnamese Army and U.S. forces. As stated in a Vietnamese military maxim: He who controls the Central Highlands, controls South Vietnam. The statement couldn't be more definitive and clear. The Central Highlands of Vietnam was long viewed as the central corridor of NVA movement, and was widely considered the most probable course of action the North Vietnamese would take if they were to launch a major offensive against South Vietnamese forces. It is important to understand the terrain in which this battle takes place and why seizing the Central Highlands was important for both sides.  The Central Highland region is sparsely inhabited. Traveling West, the terrain becomes more rugged, with mountains as high as 3000 ft bordering Cambodia. Triple canopy jungle makes up much of the vegetation at lower elevations, which makes for excellent covered and concealed routes. A main supply route used by the North Vietnamese, the infamous Ho Chi Minh Trail, was a primary area of interest for U.S. commanders and was frequently monitored. The area surrounding the landing zone in which the battle takes place is covered with a mix of tall elephant grass and stunted hardwood. A natural dry ravine runs North to South just West of the U.S. defensive position.  Prior to the battle, the North Vietnamese 33rd Regiment attacked a Special Forces base in Plei Me in October 1965, but were repulsed by the 12 man Special Forces team and the 350 Montagnard mercenaries garrisoned at the base, and a Battalion of Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) forces. This essentially set the stage for the 1st Cavalry Division to launch Operation Silver Bayonet, which was the first large-scale operation of the Division. The 1st Briagade conducted air assault missions throughout the area of operations in order to seek out and attack suspected enemy locations. The S-2 they received at the time was sketchy at best, and Operation Silver Bayonet initially didn't yield any tangible results. The 1st Brigade was eventually replaced by 3rd Brigade, and were given a mission to patrol the area surrounding Plei Me. Elements of the 3rd Brigade patrolled for three days, but never regained contact with enemy forces. The 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, 1st (Air) Cavalry Division led by LTC Harold G. \\"Hal\\" Moore, was then ordered to air assault into the Ia Drang Valley. Their mission was to find and kill the enemy.    U.S. Forces - 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry RGT under the Command of LTC Harold G. Moore:  # personnel committed to the operation:  UNIT- OFFICER- ENLISTED  A CO- 5- 115  B CO- 5- 114  C CO- 6- 106  D CO- 4- 76    Total= 430    LTC Hal Moore's Air Cavalry troopers were thoroughly trained in the relatively new concept of being air lifted via UH-1D and inserted into landing zones to assault key objectives. This battle concept became known as an air assault, and was seen as the future of modern warfare. Though LTC Moore's battalion underwent extensive training prior to deploying to the combat theater of operations, the movement and loss of trained troops and key leaders proved to significantly reduce the combat strength of 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry prior to conducting major military operations. Still, the morale of his troopers was high, which seemed to balance out the shortage of personnel committed to the mission. His men were equipped with standard M-16 assault rifles, M-79 40mm grenade launchers, M-60 machine guns, frag grenades and enough food and water to sustain them for a short fight. He would have 16 UH-1D choppers from A Co. 229th Assault Helicopter BN at his disposal to air lift his men, 2 batteries of 105mm artillery for indirect fire support from a firebase called LZ Falcon just West of Plei Me, and close air support from Air Force fighter wings. An aerial reconnaissance was conducted prior to the operation, but revealed little enemy activity. Prior to the assault, Landing Zone X-Ray was chosen as the primary landing zone. LZ X-Ray was located at the base of the foothills just NE of Chu Pong Massif. The LZ X-Ray and the foothills were to be prepped with artillery and aerial bombardment via rocket-equipped choppers to soften up any opposition in the AO. Elements of 2nd BN, 7th Cav was in reserve. The U.S. forces were prepared to bring to bear high-tech weaponry against a numerically superior force.    66th NVA Regiment, B-3 Front (PAVN/NVA) Division and H-15 Viet Cong under the Command of Deputy Commander Sr. LTC Nguyen Huu An:  UNIT Estimated# Of Troops  66th NVA Regiment 1600  H-15 Viet Cong 600Est. Total 2200 (to include elements of the 32nd NVA RGT)    The NVA Division, the B-3 Front, operating in the Central Highlands was under the command of Brigadier General Chu Huy Man. He was charged with tactical and administrative control over the PAVN and the Viet Cong, which were a communist guerilla force. The PAVN units were 320th, 33rd and 66th Regiments. The Deputy Commander, Senior Lieutenant Colonel Nguyen Huu An, was the Deputy Commander of B-3 Front conducting operations in and around the Chu Pong Massif. His forces had fortified bunkers and defensive fighting positions all along the slopes of Hill 542. The North Vietnamese objective was not to just simply control the Central Highlands, but to study the tactics, techniques and procedures of their new adversary. The NVA wanted to know how to fight U.S. forces by gauging the strengths and weaknesses of American forces. They wanted to see how the Americans employed its new technology, and come up with a strategy to defeat it. In other words, the North Vietnamese were just as anxious to pick a fight with the United States as the U.S. was ready to prove and battle test the lethality of its new airmobile concept. The NVA regulars and Viet Cong were equipped with Soviet made weaponry. AK-47 assault rifles was their weapon of choice, and RPGs, frag grenades was also the standard. As stated earlier, the numerically superior Vietnamese force was facing its high-tech opposition for the time. Morale among the NVA and Viet Cong troops was high. They had the advantage of having a better understanding of the terrain, having more personnel to conduct operations, and having control of the high ground. In addition to that, the NVA had an additional 2 Regiments, the 320th and the 33rd, operating in the immediate area to provide reinforcements. The B-3 Front's mission was simple: Lure the American forces into battle in order to learn how they fight.  The stage was set, and the two opposing forces were about to square off in the first major battle in the Vietnam War.    Prior to the first UH-1D touching down on LZ X-Ray, the battlefield was literally bombarded with artillery, accompanied by rocket-equipped helicopters. LTC Moore estimated that he could only load up to 3/4 of a Company onto the choppers per lift. Each lift would take approximately 30 minutes round trip to ferry troops to the battle. Although he managed to get at least 2 companies into position before the enemy reacted, it would still take over 4 hours to bring his entire Battalion into the fight. At approximately 1048 hrs, the first lift landed with elements of Bravo Company and the HQs element. There was no initial contact made with the NVA forces at this point. Bravo Company proceeded to move to secure the Western sector of the LZ. Upon conducting their initial sweep, they captured an enemy NVA soldier, who was in the area and was evidently caught off guard by the rapid ascension of U.S. soldiers onto the LZ. The NVA soldier had informed them that there were 3 battalions were on Chu Pong Massif who very much wanted to engage and destroy American forces, but were not able to find any. Bravo Company was then ordered to move to cover the Western flank of the LZ and to push the perimeter further out. This move was meant to allow time to keep the LZ open long enough in order to get the rest of the Battalion in place. At approximately 1120 hrs, the second lift arrives at the LZ with the remaining elements of Bravo Company and the first half of Alpha Company, who for the most part was charged with securing the South Western corner of the perimeter, which would prove effective when tying in with Bravo Company later during the course of the battle. At 1210 hrs, the third lift arrives with the rest of Alpha Company and LTC Moore was able to make a tentative push Westward to locate the enemy. At that time, Bravo Company had run into enemy contact which prompted the initial firefight of the battle. The dry creek bed or ravine that ran North to South along 1/7 Cav's Western flank proved to be an invaluable piece of terrain. It was considered to be a high-speed avenue of approach for the NVA forces to move straight off the mountain and onto the LZ. It was vital 1/7 Cav to retain control of that dry creek bed at all cost. A platoon from Bravo Company came into contact with what appeared to be a flanking element of the NVA. The NVA soldiers spotted the American troops, executed an about-face and began hauling ass out of the AO. Rather than closing ranks with the rest of Bravo Company, the Platoon Leader led his men on a dead run to catch the fleeing enemy, consequently separating his platoon from the rest of Company and Battalion. This resulted in a classic meeting engagement with the NVA forces. While pinned down, the NVA troops poured down the slopes and cut the platoon off. This, arguably, became the Achilles heel so to speak of 1/7 Cav's battle plan, as many men were lost from that platoon, and many more lost when sent to try and retrieve them. The \\"Lost Platoon\\" as they would be later referred as was isolated and surrounded by a superior number of enemy forces. Bravo Company is now heavily engaged in fighting along the Western flank against the oncoming NVA hoard making its way down the mountain, descending upon the numerically inferior American forces who realize that they must not allow their ranks to be broken until the rest of the Battalion arrives. Having bogged down Bravo Company, the NVA attempts to seize the opportunity to exploit their flanks, and NVA forces begin to maneuver a battalion sized element south of the LZ. At 1335 hrs, the fourth lift arrives with elements of Charlie Company, who quickly moves to secure the Southern portion of the LZ. Alpha Company then ties in with Bravo Company. At approximately 1400 hrs, there is a lull in the fighting as the two sides both wait for reinforcements to arrive. A single machine gun team from 3rd Platoon, Alpha Company was able to holdthe line and prevent the NVA from pushing through the defense. With each wave of American forces being airlifted in, more waves of NVA forces poured down of the Hill 542 to challenge them. The rest of Charlie and Delta Company were finally brought in. Delta Company proceeded to secure the Eastern flank of the LZ. Then, a RECCE (scout) heavy gun platoon was flown in to provide security to the TOC, secure the Northern side of the LZ, and take up defensive positions in the South Eastern corner of the LZ and covering Charlie Company's flank. Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry was then flown in as reinforcements and secure the gap between Alpha and Charlie Company in the South West corner of the LZ. The other two platoons from Bravo Company took up defensive positions in the North. At this point, the U.S. forces have generally created a wagon wheel so to speak. 1/7 Cavalry sustained heavy losses and the 2nd Battalion reinforcements provided some relief. On the enemy side, their objective was to try and break through the lines, forcing the U.S. into a close quarter combat situation, which would render the U.S. indirect fire support ineffective. However, the 1/7 Cav's success in repelling the enemy assault proved costly to the NVA. Eventually the battle wore down before nightfall, with both sides sustaining a significant number of casualties. There were light skirmishes and enemy probing throughout the night, but for the most part the battle came to a standstill. The worst fighting was yet to come.  Throughout the night, the NVA sent out probes and various skirmishes took place in around the 1/7 Cav's defensive perimeter. The lost platoon, who had lost their Platoon Leader earlier in the fight, were battle weary but determined to fight to the end.  The following morning, the NVA resumed their attack and nearly punched a hole through Charlie Company's defensive position. The H-15 Viet Cong launched an aggressive and unforgiving attack on Charlie Company's Western Flank. A platoon from Alpha company and elements of the fragmented scout platoon were shifted over to plug the hole in Charlie Company's line. Had the Viet Cong been successful in their objective and were able to punch through, the LZ would've easily been taken, and the aftermath would have been grave for the men of 1/7 Cav. LTC Hal Moore called in a \\"Broken Arrow\\", a command indicating that an American Battalion was being heavily engaged and was in danger of being overrun. It was the code word used to bring to bear the full weight of every available element of U.S. firepower to bear on progressing enemy forces. Although this proved effective, it would also cost the lives of U.S. soldiers as well. Eventually, after taking a serious ass whuppin', Charlie Company was reinforced with elements of A/2/7 and B/2/7. In the end, Charlie Company, which started out with 106 officers and enlisted, would lose 42 men KIA and 20 WIA.  After 3 days of sustained combat, 1/7 Cavalry was relieved with its sister Battalions and combat operations continued in the AO. The lost platoon was eventually retrieved, and the wounded and dead were all accounted for and brought home. In the after action report, it was recorded that 634 PAVN/Viet Cong were killed, an estimated 1215 wounded, and 6 captured. U.S. casualties amounted to 70 KIA, 121 WIA and zero missing or captured.  Did the opposing forces meet their objectives? The objective of the B-3 Front was to lure the American forces into combat to see how they fought and employed their equipment. The PAVN met that goal, but at a tremendous loss. They nearly succeeded in punching through 1/7 Cav's defense. The PAVN proved to be a formidable enemy who clearly demonstrated that they're willing to make huge sacrifices for their cause.  From the U.S. perspective, 1/7 Cavalry was successful in accomplishing its mission, which was to find and kill the enemy. The 1/7 Cavalry not only found and killed the enemy on his terrain, but proved the effectiveness of air mobility and the use of superior fire power to achieve those goals. Although 1/7 Cav themselves sustained significant losses, they were successful in bloodying the nose and repelling a numerically superior force.

0425221806|5.0|Classic Koontz. Interesting concept. Well executed.     There's a wonderfully horrific dark being that you almost have to take pity on in the end.     There's a dog. A really smart dog. Basically a human confined within a dog. But still a lovely dog.     There's an assassin. There's a person that's not quite square with the world around him. There are interesting main characters and well rounded sub-characters. There's romance. Albeit not much, but it's there.     There are those running from the law for the right reasons and those running for the wrong ones. There are those trying their best to uphold the law whether they think it's for the best or not.     A little science fiction and science fact. A lot of tension and suspense balanced with a decent amount of humor and light moments.     My fave Koontz ever.
0066620996|4.0|What makes a good leader or a good product, great.  This is the question that the author attempts to answer.  He reviews and analyzes the actions of CEO's and companies that have broken through the competition to become great.  Do you know the characteristics of a good vs. a great leader or what it take to make your product or service stand out in a competitive market?  If not, then you should read this book!
B001EYU1VO|5.0|This is an excellent multipurpose joystick. The programming software is easy to use and works even with older applications. The multiple adjustments make it easy to fit to your hand. The blue LED on the top is very bright, and is somewhat annoying in the dark when the joystick is pressed forward, but its livable.    Overall an excellent product.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.  It's fun, addictive, cute, and simply astounding for a game for a phone.
B00006L9X7|1.0|When I got this dvd I put it in my dvd player and it would not play.  The dvd player would not read it and said that it is not compatable with machines in this region (the US???).  Well, anyway, I got it cheap but could not use it.  I think the seller should mention to potential buyers if the videos may or may not work.  It was a total waste of my money.
0920668372|1.0|We got this book as a gift when our daughter was born and my husband and I were instantly turned off and creeped out by it.  We didn't like the \\"cycle of life\\" theme of growing up and death.  This is a heavy topic and something we all have to deal with, but reading it to a small child doesn't seem comforting or appropriate.  It's like \\"little baby, we'll love you always, but someday we'll get old and sick and die and you'll have to come over and comfort us\\".  Yikes.  But that's just the beginning of how weird this book is.  There's this mom who literally crawls into her son's room all through his life into manhood, makes sure he's asleep and then picks him up and rocks him.  That's just gross and gives me the creeps.  It's a mother obsessed and stalking her child, not loving him.  It also has the not so subtle message that mom loves her child when he's a \\"good little boy\\" actually sleeping and not doing anything to \\"drive her crazy\\".  Kids might drive us all \\"nuts\\" sometimes, but that is a sentiment you express to your adult friends and family who understand what you mean, not something you read to your child as a bedtime story intended to comfort them.  \\"Hey kid, you drive me crazy sometimes and I feel like selling you to the zoo...sleep tight!\\"  Horrible book.  We threw it right into recycling, we didn't even want to give it away to another family.  It belongs in the garbage.
0545123291|4.0|As I said on the title, I did not enjoy much on this book. The book is a little thicker than Shiver and consist of four different point of views.<br /><br />One thing that kept me reading this book until finished is Isabel's point-of-view. I would've give it 5 stars if not the so-not-interesting story of the other 3 characters.
6305263248|3.0|I almost always enjoy Jean Reno's work.  But.  Rarely do I enjoy Robert De Niro.  I wasn't certain if I was going to like this movie at the onset so I wasn't surprised when I found I didn't really care one way or another when it reached its rather disappointing conclusion.  I just sat there and thought....so what?  Two fantastic car chases do not make a good movie, especially when wedged in between a rudimentary caper flick involving a metal case that could contain anything from a bomb to dirty laundry, the contents are never revealed.  I have the suspicion that they didn't know what to put in this mystery case that would justified the cons and double crosses and all the forced urgency, so they decided nothing would do just as well as something.  The sad thing is I really didn't care what was in this case (worth killing and dying for) as it is not a movie I will ever watch again.  Not a keeper in any case.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I read a few reviews but just did not expect the very deep, disturbing and dark side of this movie. I love Natalie Portman, and just could not ever picture her in this kind of role.  Her acting was AMAZING - she is wonderful in the movie.  I just hated to plot of the story - too dark for me and the ending was horrible.  I am giving the movie away to a friend - with the warning to them that it is disturbing and not to let any kids near the movie (a sex scene inappropriate for kids under 18).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is great. I can't stop playing it. the levels keep changing, so you never get bored. there are always new zombies and plants to keep you on your toes.
140130916X|5.0|from Murphy's Library -- [...]    If you've read some of my reviews you already know I don't deal okay with stories where people die and we see how the people this people loved go on. I know, life goes on, I know, we must move on because there are other people who need us here... I know all the sayings when it's about losing someone you love, because it's something close to my heart--well, that's life, right?    I've never watched the movie PS, I Love You. Truth be told, I've watched its first 15 minutes countless times--but every time I had something else to do that didn't let me stay in front of the TV to finish watching it. Nowadays I'm glad I didn't, because it would had spoiled this beautiful story.    I drove myself into an angst reading phase. As I've said on my Twenty Boy Summer review, it all started with Ballads of Suburbia, it kinda gave me strenght to finally read some of the books I was wanting for a while, but couldn't put myself together to do it. PS, I Love You was on this list, and I must say it's neck to neck with Ballads of Suburbia, I can't decide which one has touched me the most.    On this beautiful story by Cecelia Ahern we see Holly, a woman who's just lost her husband after painful months fighting against brain cancer. She's trying to put herself together, picking up the little pieces that has left from her, when her mother says there's an envelope addressed to her--and when Holly asks who sent it, her mother has no idea, all she knows is that there's something else written on the envelope: The List. Before finding he was ill, Gerry used to joke he'd left Holly a list of things to do after his death, and Holly is in shock when she finds out he did it. After all, it was supposed to be just a joke.    It turns out that Gerry was serious about it, and he left her 10 notes, each one should be read on a month after Gerry's passing. Holly has already missed one of them, so when she has two to read, March and April. Through the notes, Gerry helpsHolly to cope with her lost, bringing her tons of memories from all the years they've been together. With the help of her family and friends--I loved Ciara!--, she tries to follow Gerry's instructions.    There's not a lot more I can talk about this book without spoiling the story. PS, I Love You is about moving on without forgetting all that you've lived with the person you love so much but isn't phisically around you anymore. It's an emotional journey that brought me tons of tears, tons of laughs, and shook my world. This may not be your cup of tea if you don't like cliché dramas, and it may be the kind of book you need to prepare yourself before starting reading, but I saw myself reading it slowly, wishing it would last longer.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This is it: the X-Men movie you've been waiting for.  When I heard that the new X-Men film was going to be a prequel to the current X-Men movie franchise, I was a bit underwhelmed, but hopeful.  Having seen and loved Kick-Ass, which was also directed by Matthew Vaughn, I started to move toward cautiously optimistic.  The thing I was most worried about was how devoted this film would be to the already established X-Men film universe.  While I liked the other films, I do not think they were anything special.  This film is.<br /><br />The heart of the film is the friendship between Charles and Erik, the young men who will eventually become Professor X and Magneto, the leaders of the two sides in the war between Humans and Mutants.  James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender both turn in amazing performances, especially Fassbender, who plays Erik.  When you are watching him on screen, you can see a tide of black emotions seething just under the surface.  I completely bought him as the one-day enemy of humanity.<br /><br />But Magneto's star is not yet risen in this film, so it's a good thing we have a villain that is almost as cool in the form of Sebastian Shaw, played wickedly by Kevin Bacon.  His ideals are close to those of Erik's, and it is only a personal vendetta that keeps them on opposite sides in the film's looming conflict.  Shaw leads the villainous Hellfire Club, the precursor to Magneto's own Brotherhood of Mutants.  Everyone has awesome powers, used to devastating effect in the film's terrific action sequences.<br /><br />I really loved the young actors in the movie too.  It was interesting seeing young heroes that most of us are not that familiar with.  Havok?  Darwin?  And yet, I ended up feeling more for these young upstarts than I did for the classic X-Men characters like Storm, Cyclops, and Wolverine.  They actually act like young heroes, out of their depth.  The best characters here are the young Beast and Mystique.  Their journey of self discovery, and learning to accept themselves for who they are is a highlight of the film, and deals with the philosophical heart of the X-Men movies in a touching way.<br /><br />No X-Men film before has had this level of emotional power.  Frankly, the scenes depicted in X-Men: First Class put the the rest of the X-Men film franchise to shame with their intensity.  The whole theater full of people were practically holding their breath during the film's climax.<br /><br />And about the climax of the film: I can't tell you how refreshing it is to see the final action sequence in a superhero movie happen during the daytime!  I mean, you have all these cool costumed characters using awesome abilities, and almost every comic book movie has the climax of the movie happen at night.  Every Spider-man film.  The Fantastic Four.  Both Iron Man movies.  Both Hulk movies.  (I make allowances for the Batman and Blade franchises, since that is the way it's supposed to be in those worlds.)  X-Men 1 and 3...and most of number 2 happened underground, which is practically the same thing.  But here we see people flying around in the sunlight, lifting submarines out of the ocean and spitting fireballs and teleporting around.  Maybe some people won't care about this, but to me having everything bright and shiny and under an open sky is just fitting for a superhero film.  And it's a chance to really show off your special effects.  X-Men: First Class has excellent special effects, but by now I think we've come to expect big budget comic book movies to have flashy CGI.  What we have here is something infinitely better: outstanding character relationships and a wonderful story with moments of supreme emotional power.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film, especially to those who might be wary of the X-Men franchise after a disappointing third film (not to mention Wolverine: Origins, which is also merely okay).

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Who doesn't love Johnny Depp?  He is so cool in this movie.  About half way through the film I figured out what the end of the movie would be, but it was the ending that I wanted, so I was okay with it.  Angeline Jolie plays a Brit in the movie, and in all honesty, she did okay, but not fabulous with the language - she pulled it off, but I liked her as an actress, so I went with it.  All in all, it was a great story line and I enjoyed the movie. I plan to watch it again this week.  If I had any say-so, I would have added an extra bit of filmage to show how Johnny Depp's character ended up where he was on vacation - what he went through before getting there - but I would have added that at the very end of the film.  Oh well, I'm not a director or writer, so there you have it.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I'm sorry to also say...don't waste your money on this product.     When I ordered it, I didn't realize that this was going to be the biggest and bulkiest travel wipes case I've seen, yet.  I ordered 2 and had to return the unopened one.  When I tried to use it for about a couple of weeks, the wipes dried out and the red button didn't slide so easily.   The biggest drawback is that the case does not close securely like most wipes cases. I have a toddler and a 6-month old, so I was really hoping to have an easy-access case of wipes while on the go & while having the kids in the stroller.  The wipes cannot hold much at all especially with the case opening so easily. There were a couple of times where the wipes all fell to the ground while the case was hanging from the stroller during a couple of the kids' daily \\"walks\\" to the park.  Also, why have a bulky case if you can't put more wipes in it than a normal slim case?
0545140323|5.0|from Murphy's Library -- rated 4 and a half there    The Lonely Hearts Club is one of the cutest books I've read on the past few months. With an uncompromising narrative that flies without you feeling it, the book is one of those you read to relax, have fun and have a good time reading. Penny Lane is a girl we all have been already, I swear. Who has never had a disappointment, who has never had a crush that ended up with a broken heart and decided that didn't really need men to survive? Oh, I have, a lot of times.    Penny's intentions and the situations that come with the foundation of The Lonely Hearts Club create a lot of interesting dialogues that, although are light and not too outstanding, are very clever. The mix of music and literature was a plus, in my opinion, for this book. It mixes the classic with the contemporary, in a matter of speak, in a beautiful way. I think Penny is a perfect combination of both.    The characters were well built and the book is cliché. But, well, sometimes it's nice to read what you're expecting, instead of a bunch of cliffhangers that make no sense. The Lonely Hearts Club got me with the simplicity the story's told. Some people may say it's too unpretentious, and maybe it is, but everybody needs a book just to relax and have a good time sometimes.
B0053EZY04|1.0|My title says it all....Cage ought to hang his head really low for agreeing to do this one..It stunk....the trick is if you don't have a plot or just want to tantalize...then make a film like this.

B0037QGS0A|2.0|Unfortunately, this was just one more movie about SEX.  The plot was pretty weak, and it seemed like they really went out of their way to show as many sexual scenes as possible, even when it wasn't necessary to further the plot.  I would skip this movie, if I was given the chance again.  I watched it on Netflix (through streaming media)and I just wish I could have my 2+ hours back!
0307946711|3.0|from Murphy's Library -- [...]    Dexter Mayhew and Emma Morley have an one night stand in July 15th, 1988. They're leaving college, they have their entire lifes ahead and they both agree they're not the right person to each other, so they decide to be just friends from then and on.    From 1989 through 2007, we see where Emma and Dexter are on the 15th day of July of each year. They grow apart from eatch other, though they're still in touch--well, most part of the time. Emma is this smart girl who dreams to become a writer. She struggles through life: works in a restaurant and teaches children before finally dedicate full-time to writting; while Dexter is a typical spoild boy who spends his parents' money: he travels around the world for a while, and then becomes the host of a TV show. Through all those years, we see they meet each other a few times, they've fighted, they've matured, they've changed. Well, isn't that what life is all about?    One Day was a slow reading for me. It's a long, long book, and the narrative was really slow for me--some paragraphs are too long! I loved to see India from Dexter's perspective and Paris from Emma's perspective. I laughed a lot with Emma, but it took me more than usual to finish reading it--although I loved her character and I was shocked with the ending. I'd say One Day is a book about life more than romance--and we need to remember life isn't always easy or fair...    I'm looking forward to watching the movie One Day, with Anne Hathaway as Emma and Jim Sturgess as Dexter. And as much as I love Hathaway since The Devil Wears Prada, I'm not really sure she can be a good Emma. The movie is coming out on the US theaters on July 8th, 2011--wouldn't be ironic if it were July 15th?

0061726826|5.0|from Murphy's Library -- [...]    It's been sixty-four years since the president and the Consortium identified love as a disease, and forty-three since the scientists perfected a cure.    Lena Haloway, 17, can't wait until she turns 18. But her reasons are different from our teenagers: she wants to get the procedure, to be cured, so she won't fall in love, she won't suffer the effects of amor deliria nervosa. She won't have the same fate her mother had: she had the procedure 3 times, in vain. In the end, she killed herself because she couldn't live with the disease.    Since then, Lena lives with her aunt Carol. People look weird at her wherever she goes--because they know what her mother did, they're afraid she'll have the same fate. However, Rachel, Lena's older sister, has been cured for nine years, so Lena hopes she'll be cured too, and soon, so she'll have a normal life.    But before Lena gets her procedure, she has to read the The Safety, Healthy and Happiness Handbook, or simply The Book of Shhh, as they call it, and pass through a series of tests. The evaluation, the last test, is coming, and Lena can't wait to do it. However, things didn't go as well as planned, Lena gets nervous and says a lot of things she shouldn't have said, getting herself in trouble. That's when a bunch of cows invade the room, freaking everyone out, and giving Lena a second chance: they've canceled her first evaluation, giving her the opportunity to not screw things up this time.    Where the hell did the cows come from? Nobody's sure, but they suspect. Not everyone agrees with the rules, not everyone believes the procedure is the best solution, although they don't officially talk about it. The country's sealed, the borders have been watched, so the Invalids can't come inside the country. Invalids are people who live in the Wilds and refused to have the procedure. They're not welcomed, neither the sympathizers, people who live among the cured, they've been cured, but they don't agree with the rules.    When Lena and Hana, her best friend, meet a mysterous boy named Alex one day, Lena gets intrigued. She's sure he was spying on her during her evaluation, but he denies. She's not sure they should stay around the boy--although he has the mark, the three point scar that says he's been cured, she hasn't been around boys her entire life--, but it seems Alex is everywhere from then on. And, well, you can figure out what happens between Lena and Alex, right?    I read Delirium in about 5 hours. It's a long book, but I simply couldn't put it down. I wanted to read more about the universe Oliver has created--which reminded me Ally Condie's universe in Matched, somehow--, and I wanted to read more about Lena's and Alex's story. I found myself sobbing with the ending--it's cliché, but it's simply beautiful--, at 4:30am, and dying to read more. I liked Hana, she's a little bit rebel, but she tries to keep at least one foot on the ground, I liked Lena--you can feel how desperate she is for the cure, and you understand why, as much as you understand when this changes--, and I loved Alex, I wish we had a little bit more of his story, though.    Is it February 2012? I need Pandemonium, and I need it ASAP! How could you do this to us, Lauren Oliver?

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I had no idea a phone game could be this entertaining! Game is simple, yet engaging. First time I played it, I was hooked. Got it when it was free, but I'd pay for this without a doubt!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|one of my favorite parts of this game was the endless mode on pc.  why this feature didn't make it to the android is beyond me, but it should have.  still a fun game, just loses some replay value without endless mode once you have beat everything else.
0670022411|5.0|Loved this book!!    There are numerous reviews which cover the storyline in depth, and it is because of these reviews, I got this book but never imagined that it would hook me like it did.    The world of vampires and witches come vividly alive in this book, as they live amongst us in the modern world and the story of one reluctant witch, Diana and one vampire, Matthew are the central characters who are brought together in the quest to unravel the mystery of an ancient manuscript.        The author combines her love of history into this story, and because of this, it is a mature read, full of references to the past and those who lived it.        Apart from the growing love story between Diana and Matthew - frowned upon by all other creatures - we are also introduced to wonderfully written and vivid supporting characters in this book.         I am so pleased to see that this is the first book in a series, because I cannot wait to read the second book......My only disappointment is that I can't read the sequel immediately!!        Highly recommended.

B000JQUQZO|5.0|The Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius wrote his 'Thoughts' between 170 and 180. Other titles assigned to the same book are: 'Personal Notes', 'Meditations', 'The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius' et al. It is one of the few complete works of a late Stoic philosopher that still exists today. He wrote his 'Thoughts' as personal notes for himself. He writes about solidarity, physical adversity, good and evil, inner freedom and more. 'Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius' is a book full of wisdom that brings comfort and contemplation; it is moving and inspiring. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />This edition was originally translated into English by George Long in 1862 and edited by Edwin Ginn in 1893. Ginn has written the first 8% of the Kindle edition (preface, biographical sketch), and the last 15% (on the philosophy of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus). The 'Thoughs' of Marcus Aurelius are grouped in 12 'books' (chapters). The first book is clearly different from the other eleven; it is a 'thank you' to people who have had a good influence on him. For example: 'From my grandfather Verus (I learned) good morals and the government of my temper.' (I.1). The other eleven books contain his notes. His Stoic philosophy emphasizes ethics, especially everyday problems. This book is in the public domain and can be downloaded for free from several websites.<br /><br />Some quotations from this book:<br />Since it is possible that thou mayest depart from life this very moment, regulate every act and thought accordingly. (II.11)<br />Be cheerful also, and seek not external help nor the tranquillity which others give. A man then must stand erect, not be kept erect by others. (III.5)<br />Always run to the short way; and the short way is the natural: accordingly say and do everything in conformity with the soundest reason. For such a purpose frees a man from trouble, and warfare, and all artifice and ostentatious display. (IV.51)

B003UESJH4|5.0|I had to buy the DVD because I am a huge Colin Firth fan and he won the OSCAR for his performance.   But aside from that you'll find a very touching story and incredible supportive characters. I wanted to write this review because after watching it for the first time in the movie theater, and after watching it at home my good opinion of the whole movie stayed intact but I had to mention specifically the magnificent Geoffrey Rush.  He is amazing as Logue, the speech therapist, in my opinion he deserved an Academy Award too, his performance is so graceful.  \\"LIGHT\\" SPOILER: There's a scene at the end of the movie when Logue and family are listening to the radio, England is going to war, and his oldest son enters the room, in Logue's face you see the pain, the anxiety of what's to come, the worry for his son... Award winning scene!  At this time, very few DVDs make it to the \\"special\\" list, this one is worth it, you can watch this heart-warming film again and again, it has its funny moments too.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Forty + people have already said it, so I'll just say it again.  It's a wonderful book and I can't wait to read the next in the series.  I now have another 'favorite' author.<br /><br />It met my 5 star criteria-<br />I read it in one sitting, immediately re-read my favorite portions, told friends about it, continued thinking about it and re-read the book.<br /><br />It's sweet book, even with dark characters and subjects but the juxtaposition between the dark and light in is the joy of the story.  Reads more like an adult fairy tale than a PNR, so even those who are wary or weary of vampires and werewolves would find a delightful read in this book.  I won't retell what everyone else has told other than it's a book that leaves you happier for having read it....so read it.<br /><br />Please ;)
0071120009|5.0|I learned a lot more from this book than from class, though there were some contradictory facts that I noticed (but they were very minor ones). It combines anatomy with physiology, which I think is more useful learning together at the same time, rather than separately as my professors did with separate lectures in class.

B0049P1VHS|4.0|I'm not a big fan of the comic series this is based on; don't get me wrong, I read a lot of it and enjoyed a fair amount, but after a certain point all the tragedy started to feel more comical than dark the more it was piled on, and I had to quit. The narrative at times just felt like it was too big for its chosen medium, and the characters I cared about were vastly outnumbered by the characters who I couldn't care less for because they didn't get enough \\"page time\\" to really develop.    What I was most surprised by was how good the television series is at making characters the comic had painted as villains believable and sympathetic. While Comic-Shane was little more than a mentally unstable lumbering brute, TV-Shane comes across as a still unstable but very lonely man torn between his loyalty to his best friend and his own desires. Sarah Wayne Callies as Lori does an absolutely amazing job of turning a character I previously felt was little more than a shrill, selfish, hateful witch into a strong, conflicted woman I genuinely cared about and felt bad for. Andrew Lincoln does a good job as Rick Grimes, although he hasn't really had a chance to do much beyond look determined/horrified, and Steven Yeun is supremely enjoyable as fan-favourite Glenn. Carol's character gets a drastic overhaul as a badly abused wife (or at least her husband is present here where he was absent in the comic), but I feel it gives her some sorely needed perspective and character development that her often seemingly emotionally (and maybe mentally) unstable pen-and-ink incarnation lacked.    It does disappoint in some places. Too many of the new characters are utterly unforgettable to the point that deaths that are supposed to be tragic just come across as \\"meh\\", and while the violence is mature without being sadistically gory, I felt like the narrative let me down in a few places that it deviated from the source material. One character, for example, is significantly older than they are in the comic, and I have a feeling that it was a decision that was made solely to make the May-December romance that pops up less \\"weird\\" to the viewing audience, which was a bit of a disappointment when the comic managed to portray it in an honest, mature fashion.    But while the story does deviate drastically from the source material in a way that will probably enrage die-hard comic afficianados, the television incarnation of The Walking Dead manages to be that rare beast that balances action and horror with genuine, believable human drama without one ever really getting in the way of the other. The season finale is a bit over-the-top in that it strays a bit too far into formulaic sci-fi disaster movie territory, but at this point, I have put my trust in the cast and crew to deliver. Highly recommended.
B004RQVVGU|4.0|WHERES THE REST OF \\"TONIGHT\\"? THE LONG FADED OUT SOLO.really nothing new here.pretty good live disc.i think the 95 remaster of \\"DIARY\\" and \\"BLIZZARD\\" both sound better than these.
B000QCS8TW|3.0|While Martin has a knack for creating interesting characters, the Game of Thrones and the rest of the series aren't exactly what you might call action-packed. The problem with such an enormous cast of characters is that you're bound to find characters you love over characters you find boring, and it can be a long, long time before the narrative cycles around to whoever you're more interested in hearing about. As you might expect from its title, the series really is one massive fantasy conspiracy/political thriller, and at times the pages and pages of conversations detailing who is double-crossing whom or who is trying to suss who out as a traitor can really make your eyes glaze over.<br /><br />An alternate title might also be The Game Where Nothing Nice Ever Happens to Anyone (And If It Does, Something Worse Happens Immediately Afterwards). To put it bluntly, for a lot of the cast the series almost comes across as psychological torture porn, particularly in the case of the young female leads who are consistently degraded and abused, but really nobody is safe from having multiple, emotionally scarring tragedies befall them in every book. It winds up getting tedious, and you can't help but wonder what the point of it all is. Who cares if this person is rescued? She's only going to get raped and murdered later. Who cares if this person wins a duel? They'll probably be forced to watch their kingdom burn next chapter.<br /><br />Ultimately, this series requires a lot of commitment, and it wasn't one I was willing to give. After reading the first four books I had to call it quits. It didn't feel like the characters were getting anywhere, and the plot was moving like molasses in winter. While there were characters I enjoyed (and even loved a little), the whole thing is too plodding and gloomy to really feel like anything more than a chore, and I didn't feel like seeing what terrible thing was going to happen to Sansa next. As of book four, it didn't feel like any real headway had been made in the plot, unless the plot was \\"the world is a terrible place, and no matter what you do, it will take a big dump on you at the moment you're happiest\\". Make no mistake, if you enjoy meticulously detailed worlds and can keep up with its labyrinthine treacheries and ever-growing cast, the Song of Ice and Fire series is definitely worth a look. However, if you don't enjoy fantasy novels that leave you feeling depressed and cynical of the entire human race, you may want to download a sample or check this one out of the library before you shell out the cash.de in the plot, unless the plot was \\"the world is a terrible place, and no matter what you do, it will take a big dump on you at the moment you're happiest\\".

B003SNJYSK|1.0|This book begins with, and the plot turns on, a case of mistaken identity with agents guarding dignitaries. It has the hero, Harry Hole, checking his .38 caliber revolver and then checking for the two 'magazines' for the gun. revolvers do not have magazines. Then he checks the safety. Revolvers do not have safeties. Then he runs toward a person in a toll booth and worries that his weapon will penetrate the 'light ballistic' vests of the Secret Service. 'light ballistic' vests will easily stop a 38 caliber round. Then he opens fire and penetrates the heavy glass of a toll booth with that .38 caliber revolver; unlikely.<br /><br />And the suspect he fires at is alone. I've worked presidential security details. No one, repeat no one, is ever deployed alone.<br /><br />So the book starts off with utter nonsense and goes very quickly south with purple prose, Hardy boy dialog and characters; there is generally little to pull it out of the hole -- you'll excuse the pun -- of the first few chapters. If you're a young adult and utterly indifferent to accuracy in your thrillers, this might be a book for you. I'd pass and save the money, were I you.<br />[[ASIN:0061134007 The Redbreast: A Novel]]

0316067598|5.0|Osama bin Laden's death and the press surrounding the heroic Navy Seals made me want to learn more about the Seals.<br /><br />I spent some time on Amazon noodling around various titles and ordered Marcus Luttrell's acclaimed memoir Lone Survivor.<br /><br />This book does.not.stop. The last time I read a book with this much tension and action was [[ASIN:078670621X Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage]] another incredible adventure book.<br /><br />Marcus Luttrell is a member of the elite Seals. This book successfully travels between his early years, his training and the fateful Afghanistan mission the encompasses the bulk of the book. Normally a book that flips between past and present feels awkward and breaks the spell. Not in this case. The training of the Seals is almost as riveting as the mission. I considered his description of Hell Week as essential to comprehending his ability to survive the mission in Afghanistan.<br /><br />This book will break your heart. This book will make you rethink rules of engagement and make you wonder about human decency. Truly the best and worst of both are on full display here.<br /><br />If you chose to read this book about a Marcus Luttrell a modern hero, you can also learn more about his journey since he returned home. I was compelled to read about him on Wikipedia and he accepted my friend invitation on Facebook (he will accept yours too, I'm no one special). Mr. Luttrell clearly feels a responsibility to honor his friends, I admire him and enjoy following his work going forward.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|I purchased 2 of these mics based on the positive reviews I had read here on Amazon. I should have read more closely the negative reviews - they match up almost exactly to my own experience. I'm highly disappointed, and I strongly discourage you from buying them if audio quality is of any importance to you.    I first tested out one of the mics in my apartment, which is relatively quiet. The hiss produced by the microphone rendered the audio completely unusable. I had to shout almost directly into the mic to pick up any reasonable levels (to overcome the hiss). And yes - the battery was in place and the mic was turned ON. (when switched OFF, you hear nothing at all). Go check out a few of the Youtube videos that are demoing the ATR-3350 - the hiss is almost always noticeable.    I realize these are $22 lav mics, and low-quality is to be expected. But I switched to $30 lavs from RadioShack - and they made a world of difference, even if they didn't come in a shiny white box. Sorry Audio-Technica, this product is a major fail.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I simply could not put this book down!  Great characters, fast moving plot despite the fact that the book is HUGE -- and enough historical facts to make it even more intriguing!  Absolutely loved it - can't wait for the next two books in the trilogy to come out!
0553582038|4.0|Book 3 was fantastic.  In the last half of this book we see the story lines of all our favorite characters moving forward at a nice pace.  This is one of things that George does so well.  Things are constantly happening.  Book 4 does NOT continue or advance any of the major story lines for the majority of the characters that were the primary focus in Book 3.  As you can see from the RANGE of reviews this has caused some serious backlash.    Book 4 is a very well written book.  Remember that Westeros contains the 7 kingdoms.  Until book 4, we heard very little of Dorne, and the Iron Islands.  George uses this book to introduce us to new characters and these lands.  Many readers found it frustrating to read about new characters and lands when they were so desperate to find out what was going to happen with their favorites from Book 3.    This book should not be skipped as some very bitter fans have advised.  Take any review less then 3 stars with a giant boulder of salt.  These fans are upset that the major story lines did not advance.  They are so upset by this fact, that in their rage they did not give a fair assessment of this book.    I read this book in 2005 when it initially came out.  I would have given it 3 stars at that time, because I shared in many a readers frustration that we did not get to read about our favorite characters.  I have just finished Book 4 and I really enjoyed it.    Revisiting this book with the proper expectations, I feel very comfortable giving it a 4 star review.    In this book you are not going to read anything about Bran, Jon, Daenerys, or Stannis.  There is no wall, there is no update on what is going on with Daenerys across the narrow sea.  If you can accept this, and can go into Book 4 with an open mind, then you will enjoy this book as I did.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Black Swan is the story of Nina Sears and her triumph of landing the Swan Queen role in the production of Swan Lake by her ballet company. While the story for me was predictable (meaning the suprise at the end wasn't a suprise) I still thought it was a great movie, with great acting, and an interesting thrilling story. Both Mila Kunis and Natalie Portman acted well, and the movie is full of suspense taking you into the mind of Nina and her plunder into the depth of her role as the Swan Queen. The movie is filmed in a way that brings suspense, and drama, and of course the art of ballet in the movie is incredible. Portman so thouroughly transforms herself into a ballerina for this role that it's unbelievable. The dancing, and the art of ballet almost tells a story itself in the movie. There is epic drama in this movie, and it was absolutely better than I even expected it to be.
1400079144|2.0|I loved the DaVinci Code, and loved Angels and Demons, but The Lost Symbol was a sleeper. Pages and pages and pages of details, details, and more details....made for a long process getting through this book.    I started in January, got about a third of the way through it and put it down. Made up my mind I was going to finish it. Picked it back up on June 3rd and finished it in the wee hours of June 5th.    I thought I was going to die!!!! Langdon dies and comes back to life. Please.....that's not even close to being believable. Just when you think the story is ending, you look to find you have almost a quarter of the book left to read.    That last quarter-ish droaned on for what seemed like forever, and came across sounding very preachy. However, one must read it themselves and make their own decision.

0525423273|5.0|What can I say? I truly loved this book. One of the cutest books I've read in a long time. Adorable and sweet. It had me grinning throughout.<br /><br />We have Anna moving to Paris to attend school, olny because her father wants her to. She's reluctant at first, but then she finds the charms of his great city. Meeting friends, wandering the city, falling in love ...<br />I want to hang out with those guys, walk down the streets of Paris, get lost in classic movies. &Eacute;tienne? No words, really. Where was my &Eacute;tienne growing up? I feel like I want to take these characters, put them in my pocket and carry them around all the time ... which is why I'm leaving this book in my Kindle.<br /><br />Nice character development and I truly didn't want this book to end. I even procrastinated a bit, just for that reason. I can't wait to read more of Perkins books and see where she takes us. San Francisco? I'm excited already.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars. But, really, not enough.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|The film is very interesting, though its director, Clint Eastwood, the people are accustomed to look the other way, and you may think that is really so, it seems this is a very sensitive within which is to see the pain of others, and this is not the only movie that plays with a theme which has interest in others. The most interesting is how everything is going to connect, until eventually everyone finds the answer that fate has preserved, I have nothing negative to say about a topic that everyone knows very well that is not controlled by ourselves, if not many movies that touch this topic.<br />Anyway, the acting of Matt Damon is very interesting to demonstrate one more time, just how versatile he is.
B003Y3MYYU|5.0|Edit 12/24/13:<br /><br />Go to amazon.co.uk or amazon.de and buy the 2013 edition over the one this review is listed under.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BHNQ1N4 Richard Wagner Nibelungen Remastered Burmeister]]<br /><br />It's only 12 discs, with Walküre and Siegfried on 3 each with all the bad breaks removed. The Götterdämmerung act III disc break is still present, though. Sound is a different remaster, but it sounds better IMO, but honestly not that different. A bit less background \\"fuzz\\" (also noticed this on the complete versus highlights of Karajan's Vienna Fledermaus), but both are still quite clear and excellent quality.<br /><br />Buying from the US is expensive as it is an import, and I paid $45 for it from Germany with expedited shipping. Germany and UK allow foreign currency and shipping too.<br /><br />Original Review 2011:<br /><br />This Ring Cycle is often listed on the top of critics' lists, and for good reason.<br /><br />First and foremost is Karl Böhm's superb conducting. Anyone who has heard his Mozart is in for a shock. He is so relentlessly fast that he makes Solti look like an old crone driving 30 mph on the freeway. But the force at which he conducts enhances the drama, as you are swept into a chaotic and brutal world of Gods, Dwarfs, Giants, Dragons, and (eventually) Humans. While the speed is not always well suited to certain scenes, he manages to craft his tempi in such a way that you cannot help but focus almost solely on the drama unfolding onstage. Perhaps this is one recording that would be better on video.<br /><br />The cast is fantastic as well. While some of members are past their respective primes vocally (Greindl, Mödl, and Neidlinger sound old, Windgassen as dry as cement, Rysanek a bit tired), everyone is dramatically effective and create wonderful performances. Nilsson manages to surpass her studio performance for Solti (one of, if not THE, best Brünnhildes on record) by her sheer involvement in the role if not always vocally.Perhaps the most amazing thing about this recording is that she still has the stamina to belt out the Immolation Scene after more than 4 hours on the final evening. Windgassen is still Siegfried even if he is huffing and puffing a bit at the end; King manages to outdo himself as Siegmund, and NOBODY has yet to equal his performance here; Adam has a powerful, if extremely dry voice, and is extremely involved as Wotan; Mödl is too tired to be an extremely effective Waltraute, but her involvement and dedication are outstanding; Stewart is not Uhde or Fischer-Dieskau, but his Gunther is enjoyable and better than some of the others out there; Wohlfarht is a nasty and bitter Mime, rivaling Stolze is vocal ugliness; Böhme is as frightful as ever; Nienstedt makes a brutish and positively EVIL Hunding, almost surpassing Frick and Greindl; Rysanek is a dedicated Sieglinde, whose chemistry with King is fantastic; Niedlinger and Greindl need no description. Smaller roles are taken well, with Anja Silja nearly stealing the show as Freia, and Dernesch, Wagner, and  make some of the best Rhinemaidens on record.<br /><br />The Bayreuth orchestra was never first class, and are probably at their worst here, (the trumpets in the Trauersmarsch sound like they are performing a Morricone score), but the way Böhm leads them, and the set back acoustics make the listener forget this the instant the vocals start.<br /><br />The sound is pretty good, with everything coming in clearly and well. For anyone who has heard Keilberth, while the orchestral sound was better there, here everything is clearer and there is no echo. There is a large amount of stage and audience noise, the latter of which can be so bad it makes me want to pull a Jon Vickers (\\"Stop your damned coughing!\\"). For the most part, however, it does not obstruct the noise that badly, and even the occasional bad mic placement is tolerable. As for the remastering, I still only have the Phillips release, but guessing from the factthat Decca chose not to fix the track listing (it can easily fit onto 12 discs with each Act of Siegfried being less than 80 minutes) they may simply polished the Philips tapes, if at all.<br /><br />Böhm's cycle has a lot to offer, and despite its setbacks, it manages to eclipse several other cycles out their, and truly is a benchmark performance.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />Having received the new Decca edition, I tell can that it has likely NOT been restored. I figured this out since I used to have the Phillips release (I sold mine to pay for the new one with a significant net profit), and I am very disappointed in Decca for pulling and EMI (repackaging an old edition and claiming it's \\"new\\"), especially since the track listing SUCKS (see above). The packaging is very nice, better overall than the Phillips release. It does not contain the photos, which is a let down, but since they were astonishing low resolution on the Phillips release (I have heard that the old old edition with the librettos has better pictures though), I am not too worried about this. The booklet is glossy and contains an entire track by track synopsis of the entire cycle, has a nice (if all to brief) essay on the recording, and lists the complete cast on the back of the box. The box is made to look like  a metal box with postage stamps on it, and is much better looking than the rather dark and dank version from Phillips.<br /><br />Anyone who already has the Phillips release should stay with it (I decided not too only because I fervently disliked the look of the box), but it is certainly nice to have a significantly cheaper edition of this monumental recording out there for people who are new to the cycle.

0553386794|3.0|This is the only book I've read in the series, so bear that in mind as you read on.<br /><br />As far as \\"Game of Thrones,\\" there were some things I liked, some things I disliked.<br /><br />World Building: Martin's world is well-painted and believable - largely based off European medieval-ism (though historically inspired by the War of Roses). He obviously knows his history and has painted well the gritty reality of centuries past. There are gods in this world, but whether they exist or not is left ambiguous. It is a twist on much fantasy literature, where gods and goddesses galore intervene in the affairs of the world. There is magic, but is mostly alluded to - it's hinted that magic played a larger role in the past than it does in the present age.<br /><br />Most fantasy I've read follows a rags to riches story - unknown boy becomes great hero, saves the day - Frodo Baggins, Rand Al'Thor, Richard Cypher, etc, etc. Not here. It follows the workings of the nobles from the get-go, and hardly ever gives attention to the peasantry or lower classes. But it's interesting to read fantasy where we get a high-low view rather than the low-high view.<br /><br />In all, the world building is very unique, compared to other fantasy novels. Not to say it's completely devoid of cliches - \\"an evil storm brewing in the north behind some sort of wall\\" has been done a lot.<br /><br />Characters: What irked me about \\"Game of Thrones\\" were the characters. Not that they were bad, or unbelievable...I just found it hard to root for any of them, because very little of them stand for what is good (and if they do, they are punished for it...severely). I like how Martin is challenging the cliche of fantasy = good vs. evil, and instead going for \\"realistic,\\" yet, at the same time, I prefer characters that are good, believe in the power of good, and we will fight for THAT instead of their own selfish motives and ambitions. There are people like that in the real world, though they admittedly have their faults, so it's not exactly \\"unrealistic.\\"<br /><br />I know moral ambiguity is sort of the \\"point\\" of this series, but personally, I prefer a happy ending. I'm not saying \\"Game of Thrones\\" is bad because of this...it's just a preference. Perhaps Martin could have handled this better to convert people like me, but maybe I'm asking too much.<br /><br />Plot: Martin's book suffers from the get-go what Robert Jordan suffers from \\"Dragon Reborn\\" onward...too many points of view going on at once. Even in a huge book like Game of Thrones, you can't develop eight characters when each of them only gets a short time on the stage. There are no main characters in Game of Thrones, so instead of feeling personally connected with them, you are like a distant observer watching a tragedy unfold. Maybe this is a good thing, because the book would otherwise be more depressing than it already is. When good characters died and evil triumphed, I found myself not caring either way. I feel like this could have been solved had Martin cut out some of the points of view, leaving only Eddard, Tyrion, and Dany, and perhaps Arya, who I found to be the most interesting and personal. If he had focused on and developed these more, the book would have been better. I wonder whether Martin cut some lives short - not out of \\"realism,\\" but because too many threads were weaving a literary Gordian Knot.<br /><br />By the way, the strongest story arc is Dany's. It won a Hugo award for a reason. Though her ending was kind of WTF.<br /><br />I could have gone in greater detail.

Nearly EVERY ONE of my bookish friends (and I am not exaggerating when I say that) has been raving about this book. It is totally my kind of book; I just could never find the time to read it. Foolish, foolish girl! I should have made time sooner. Who needs sleep! Work? Overrated. Seriously. If you've been meaning to read this one do it and do it now.<br /><br />This review was incredibly hard to write. Every time I sat down to start it I'd pick the book up and get lost in rereading my favorite parts. Turns out basically the whole book is my favorite part so that was a bit distracting! As I sit here now I have moved the book to a shelf downstairs and will not allow myself to go look at it. The fact that I had to put the book on time-out to write my review should tell you how deep my love is for it!<br /><br />Ms. Perkins does an amazing job of writing characters that are authentic. They aren't perfect but we love them anyway (Well, at least we love the nice ones! Nobody likes Amanda!) Anna's neatness and St. Clair's thing about heights only make them more endearing. Not that they needed it... seriously? They may be two of my favorite characters ever. I mean, I didn't write my name with St. Clair's surrounded by hearts or anything. Really. I didn't. ***runs to hide notebook*** But seriously. ALL of the characters are well written. As the reader I felt like I knew them. They weren't just place holders or obligatory additions to show the school actually had students.<br /><br />I'm already getting long winded but I can't wrap this up without raving about the setting. Paris! A boarding school! Perfection! I loved \\"visiting\\" the sights with Anna. Paris is a city that I long to see. Books like this keep me checking flight prices!<br /><br />When I turned the last page of Anna and the French Kiss I wanted to flip to the front and start reading all over again. This NEVER happens! The book was that good. It's a fabulous romance that leaves the reader sighing in contentment.<br /><br />Random things I loved:<br />*The Star Wars mentions (Especially when Anna plays w/ Sean over break!)<br />*St. Clair's love for history and sharing his random knowledge<br />*St. Clair's British accent... sign me up!<br />*Anna's obsession with theater<br />*The times when Anna's southern drawl slips out<br />*The email exchange between Anna and St. Clair<br />*The kissing scenes! (No shame here! I love me some romance!)<br />*The fact that Stephanie Perkins manages to make the Canadian flag romantic.as that good.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|i dont leave many reviews but this is a great game.<br />im very picky and hate dinky games. my epic has a ton of power and this seems to be one of the few that utilizes it.<br />i find plants vs zombies to be a great time killer.  its funny, easy to pick up (not put down) , and has the perfect amount of difficulty.  while it is a bit short, i cant see making it any longer as it could get very repetitive.  i really like the special levels with the conveyor, whack-a-zombie, etc.<br />i would like to see the full almanac entry for earned plants as i get them.<br /><br />amazon, the wifi only is crap!  i have sprint (no cap) and my 4g is faster than my &quot;borrowed&quot; wireless.  please up the 20MB cap.

0756404738|4.0|I loved the Name of the Wind. The Wise Man's Fear wasn't as much of a page turner as the first. I do feel it helped show how Kvothe came to be who he is. I found myself constantly wishing he would return to the university. All and all I did like it even if it wasn't as  exciting as the first. I hope the 3rd makes up for it thought.
1582701709|2.0|As a proponent for always maintaining a healthy dose of skepticism, I'm not a strong candidate for having read this book. Were it not recommended to me by someone I like and respect, namely, my doctor, I'm sure I would have avoided it like the plague.<br /><br />Now that I have read the book and kept an \\"open mind\\" as I did, I know WHY I would have avoided it.<br /><br />As many other commentators have suggested, the book is full of claims and \\"promises\\" that would make snake oil salesman blush. I truly felt the author and the league of contributors she cites were counting on me -- their reader -- possessing the intellect and gullibility of a child.<br /><br />To be fair, a certain percentage of the offerings in the book and pronouncements about the contributors did possess a certain level of merit. I'd put that percentage at about 10 to 15%.<br /><br />For example, yes, it is a good idea, a VERY good idea to:<br /><br />  * Love thyself<br />  * Think positively<br />  * Be grateful<br />  * Believe in your abilities, your inner worth, that you can do anything, BE anything you set your sights on<br />  * Etc...<br /><br />I'm not knocking any of this. It's all great stuff. Really, it is!<br /><br />I also liked reading early on in the book that all of the contributors regularly practice meditation, this lends them at least some credibility, because volumes of solid evidence demonstrate a wide range of benefits from meditation. If only they devoted more of the book to meditation in exchange for the much-repeated nuttiness of \\"the Universe wants you to have this\\" \\"the Universe wants you to have that\\", they just might have had a good, respectable book to their credit.<br /><br />As it is, the book to their credit is not much to brag about...aside from the enormously big bucks it raked in for them.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|Predictable plot, outlandish violence with a vengeance theme. Seems I have seen this movie before....like a million times, just different titles.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It has lost the same game data twice now, and its really annoying. But the game is addicting and super fun
B004H83IG4|4.0|It seems pretty clear what happened to the woman in this true missing person (murder?) case, but I will not say too much more about that.  Gosling and Dunst do a great job as the two leads in this story of a married couple whose relationship unravels during the 1970s.  I wish there had been a bit more about the investigation and related issues, but for the most part this is a fascinating story.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Mostly smooth but stretched out on my atrix and low frame rate when you pick up new plants. The atrix is a dual core tegra 2, really no excuse for poor performance and non native resolution. $1.49 feels wasted on a lazy port. With an update in sure it will be gold, though.

B004FEJ3VY|5.0|I bought this Prime in preorden. The first thing that comes to your mind is the size, the new Voyagers looks like the old Deluxes, the alternate mode is very small and it feels like a Micromachine. The truck is not very detailed, specially the front part of the truck but I like it. I am a collector but I feel pretty pleased with my purchase, I think kids are going to love playing with this Prime. I felt like a kid again when opened the box and transformed the figure.
0307477479|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It had good plot turns that I wouldn't have expected. The redemption that occured was balanced out by some reallity facing other characters.
0385341008|5.0|This book is fantastic -- I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended. It's got humor, history, compelling personalities, and a little romance. I absolutely adored this book.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I downloaded this game as the free app a couple of days ago and since then I haven't been able to put it down! the game looks great and gameplay is fun and challenging at times I'm really enjoying it the only catch I think is it eats battery life like crazy! other than that loving it
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this for my wife who had went on a diet and exercise regimen to get her weight and health under control.  For 30 days she followed the training program listening to Micheal's relentless and sometimes brash encouragement doing each routine as required.  At the end of 30 days along with a proper diet consisting of portion control and eating the right foods she had lost 10 lbs and was able to get out and run and had more energy and had less need to sleep past 8 hours.  The one thing that I would recommend that was not in the video is to spend extra time stretching specially your legs and feet and also make sure you have a pair of good quality workout shoes recommended by a stride specialist as you will be doing some exercises that will put strain on your feet and legs.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Ran great for a few days on my G2x... now loads for a few seconds, then returns to home screen. Will try again in a few days, but not impressed so far...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I didn't know how well this would work on my droid x, but it has worked flawlessly for me.  It is so fun!  Seriously, give it a try.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Fun, addictive game, but it does cause some force closes on my Captivate.  Some end of level animation slows to a crawl and occasionally locks my device, forcing a battery pull to get control back.  Hopefully an update is forthcoming that will address some of these issues.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was excellent! I cannot count the number of times I have watched this entire series. I almost never watch a show more than once. It has all the right elements of a good story including characters, dialog, humor, and surprise. I cannot get enough of it.
B00457X7XQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Mark Russinovich for years.  Not because he was a novelist, but because he knew more about Windows than Microsoft.  I relied on his site sysinternals.com to research my toughest Win32 problems when I was an IT manager.  He was (is) so knowledgable in fact, Microsoft hired him and bought out his site.<br /><br />I'm not in the habit of reviewing books.  At least not novels.  In fact, the last novel I got really caught up in was The DaVinci Code.  By caught up I mean I couldn't put it down.  I burned through 200 pages per day, stayed up late and got up early to finish it.  I've read several books since, including a couple of really good novels, but haven't been caught up until I started reading Zero Day.<br /><br />I've read a couple of novels where tech and/or hacking was a central theme but I either never found them believable or the tech stuff was so over the top it ruined the story.  Not so with Zero Day.  It turns out Mr. Russinovich is as excellent at writing novels as he is at writing code. Zero Day has everything a good novel needs; rich characters, an excellent plot, intrigue and just enough sex.  From a geek angle, Mr. Russinovich nails it. After the first couple of chapters I had no doubt he has walked a mile in our shoes.  I burned through all 320 pages in two days.  Couldn't put it down.  If you enjoy computers and IT stuff, then I have no doubt you'll love Zero Day. In fact, this book is so well done non-geeks will love it too.
B000WEMH3C|3.0|If your looking for a cover to last, this isn't the one to buy. For $8 bucks it will do the job for a while, but if you leave your grill outside exposed to the sun the vinyl will get brittle and crack on top. When the temp drops below 65 degrees the cover is hard to work with because it gets stiff. I've owned two with same results, not sure how long it would last if kept out of the sun. I'm to poor to keep buying these cheap covers, my next purchase is going to be the premium model.
1400031362|5.0|The \\"N.1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" series is in all senses a number one. I've finished \\"Morality for Beautiful Girls\\" and all the qualities of the previous books are there, especially that which attracts me most: the sensitive, caring, insightful approach to the characters and the social and cultural environment. Better still, it's funny, entertaining, well written, keeping you all the way interested in the cases in which Precious Ramotswe gets involved. Those who appreciate regular, streamline suspense books, on the other hand, may not find in this one what they are looking for. It's everything but common detective novel work. I also recommend the HBO series based on the books. [[ASIN:B0016Q2D1Q The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency (The Complete First Season)]]
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one of those games on this OS that you just cannot put down.  Fun and funny!  Only downside is that it takes wifi to initially download it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|My current Star Wars DVDs are worn out from watching them so many times. They have little scratches on them from taking them in and out of the cases and players and being left out. It happens. My Empire Strikes Back disc is espescially worn. So hell yeah I'm going to buy the Blu-Ray set when it comes out. I can't wait. Do I wish they'd correct the whole Han short first thing? Sure. But so what. It doesn't ruin the enjoyment of my all time favorite movies. I mean, Natalie Portman annoys me more than Jar Jar. I just don't think her acting was all that good. But I still LOVE Star Wars and I will definitely buy this Blu-Ray set. And I'm sure I'll buy another set in 5 years or so.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Runs smoothly on my Samsung Galaxy Tab, with the exception of framerate drops whenever you receive a new plant upgrade. Gets a little choppy, but Galaxy's clear screen makes it an enjoyable game overall. Good touchscreen port.
0307272702|5.0|I don't even remember how I heard about this book but I am so glad that I did.  I have read every health and diet book out there.  I remember thinking this would be just another one but hey just give it a try.  Boy, was I wrong!  This book is life changing and I am living proof.  Gary Taubes is a genius who's writing is easy to read, understand and apply.  I have had this book for 5 days and read it 3 times.  I just couldn't believe what I was reading, how easy and simple his suggestions were.  And, to have them all backed up by rock solid science, ta da....the icing on the cake.  I highly recommend this book, this life style change and Gary Taubes.  Read this book, use his suggestions, don't listen to the \\"negative\\" people and you too will feel as good as I do right now!  Life Changing!  (Oh yeah I almost forgot, 8-lbs gone and feeling great)
B000N3ST9I|4.0|This album is a really metal album with great solos and very good melodies and generally compositions. The production is excellent and i like the vocals too. I have all their albums but i cant say that i like them too much . Well in this album they play their best stuff and im glad to have this album. Most of the tracks are big and awesome and its an album that i will hear many times . I hope they continue to play like this in their new coming albums.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|I mainly bought this HSF because of it's great reviews for cooling performance and for it's quietness. Is it quiet? Most definitely. My stock HSF was running around 3,000 RPM's most of the time, and when I did any real gaming, It would rise to well above 3,500 and sometimes reach almost 4,000. Since this was an 80mm fan, you can imagine the high pitched noise that it made. This cooler is MUCH quieter than my stock HSF, but since it uses a 120mm fan instead of the tiny 80mm fan, it's pretty much a no brainer as to why it's quieter. So It wouldn't be to fair to give much credit to Cooler Master for this, though I do really enjoy a quieter computer, so thanks! One thing I did notice, is an odd low pitched noise coming from the fan. It sounds as if the fan's bearing is rubbing up against something. It's not that noticable, but I'm worried it might lead to a fan failure. It could have been due to the bubble protection in the shipping box had been popped, but I'm not sure. I'll be calling Cooler Master about it to see if i can get a replacement fan. As for cooling performance, I was quite disappointed. I was reading all over the place of people getting temperatures of up to 10C cooler than there stock HSF's  at Idle, and even greater drops when load was on the system. So far, I've only been able to get a couple degrees Celsius lower temps at Idle, and about a 3-6C lower Load temp, but these temps are always changing back and fourth. I've checked to see If the HSF had moved around, but it's still sitting right where it should. I plan to remount It again in a few days and reapplying the thermal paste, but I suspect I'll still have the same results. Overall, I personally think I might have gotten a faulty unit from a bad batch, but it is still a decent HSF and will definitely make for a quieter computer. Now that i've had the chance to work with it and use it, I can't really say I would recommend it per say, but I wouldn't put It at the bottom of the list either.
B0000D96NW|3.0|Im definitely not a huge fan of Machine Head and this album is another just ok album by them. There are no tracks to make the difference - its simply a metal band with average songs.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I remember when I saw the trailer for this movie and told myself, I really hope the \\"special item\\" isn't a Bible because that'd be a bit too cliche (it'd be more interesting if it turned out to be say a book on farming or something key for the rebuilding of society...though you could argue a Bible might be such a key).    Even so, I had to see it since I really like Denzel Washington and Gary Oldman (and Mila Kunis isn't exactly hard on the eyes). Wow, it took a few minutes before it sunk in and I really loved this movie. The almost sepia-toned picture and ambient soundtrack might seem \\"bland\\" but it really works well. I also like that the movie doesn't hit you over the head with what's going on. It's subtle and despite the partial spoiler about the book (hey, the product description has it so I went with it) there's still another surprise which adds to the discovery.    And, despite knowing what happens, my subsequent runs through (yes, I liked it that much) were still just as enjoyable. Great actors, beautiful scenes (despite it being desolate), beautiful ambient soundtrack, and a great story really make this movie worth adding to my collection.     And, even though it doesn't seem to be in the description or title of the product, this Blu-Ray turned out to be a combo pack including a DVD and a digital copy (though supposedly the digital copy expires June 11, 2011 which is ridiculous). Not a bad deal considering it cost less than the DVD version alone.    If you like post-apocalyptic movies, like Denzel Washington, are are just interested in something that tells a great story, by all means, buy this.
B000003H34|4.0|The dream of drifting into oblivion in moments of calm desperation is contemplated in the sober realization of the futility of human desires against a universe whose order of operation appears antagonistic towards such interests; it is this condition that Anathema's music laments, The Silent Enigma being the band's bleakest examination, the work in its entirety becoming increasingly despairing throughout its duration, its expressive essence of the human spirit in continuous conflict with universal reality communicating the hopelessness of our ambitions in a world such as this, posing the question of the possibility of ever altering our dreams so that they correspond with universal laws, or if we should accept our condition in the useless endeavor of finding lasting peace in a suffering existence.     Rhythm guitarist Vincent Cavanagh takes over lead vocals, expressing a range of dark emotions through desperate screams, hostile growling, and mournful moan-singing with a slight resemblance to Tom Warrior's approach on Celtic Frost's Into The Pandemonium, only more despondent as it interacts with slow, dismal riffs and tearful lead melodies within structures identifying a unification of clarified verse and chorus sections and lengthy atmospheric passages, abstract enough to stimulate the intellect as well as the emotions yet never losing a song's point of emphasis through meandering too far, as if to keep the listener suspended between dream-state and the order of reality.    \\"(as one) forever searching   For landscapes serene   Amidst the sunset of age   With joyous masquerade...   ...the summers died\\"    In a motion like that of encircling dark clouds, these somber riffs in expansive patterns exude a hypnotic quality as if to induce slumber, producing vivid melodies that sway between tranquility and sorrowful yearning emerging through the misty gloom to illuminate the development of harmony, producing an enveloping ambience through its structure like that of aimlesswandering through bleak landscapes, uncertain whether the sunlight just over the distant horizon is real or an illusion. The guitarists display an inventive technique of using feedback as atmospheric supplement to riffs and melodies like dream dust sprinkled over the music for the luring of enchantment, while elsewhere contemplative clean guitars and emotional solos bring to mind classic Pink Floyd in the \\"Comfortably Numb\\" style of drifting from concentrated sections into free-flowing atmospheric beauty through heartfelt guitar solos over an ocean of ethereal keyboards, establishing a mood of painful reflection increasing in sustain over the course of a song, perfectly timed for release, as if they know the audience cannot endure the experience beyond a certain point, thereby forming harmony between the alluring introductions of these songs and the offering of deliverance provided by the conclusions. The band's compositional vision, specifically the forethought on part of the songwriters in the expectation of atmospheric shade and duration of suspension prior to climactic resolution, is really something special, an exquisite ability of portraying a character of mood through rhythmic tempo and melodic progression, executed with profound passion and brilliant artistic perception.    Transitions are often marked by alterations in tone or extended melodic guitar or bass line, while themes are accented by extended solos, subtle keyboards, or increased activity in percussion, isolating acoustic guitars and female vocals for the distant and dreamy \\"...Alone\\" to portray a fragility of loneliness in the aftermath of abandonment. The melodies represent concept in a captivating method of intuiting the feeling of an experience actualized in a living moment, unified with rhythmic patterns and tonal motion to correlate with the perceived movement of time during the experienced thematic event, produced with a quality of sound intended to emphasize each contrasting element towardsunification in commonality with previous works, but here the overall spirit of the music is less overtly romanticized while taking on a more introspectively anguished character; The Silent Enigma is Anathema attempting to bring our existential condition into perspective, confronting the sources of our suffering in a more personally direct fashion than was the case before. This results in a decidedly different sound than the ethereal romanticism of the first album, with a more diverse approach to songwriting and more expansive concept of melody. Like all Anathema albums, the music offers moving moments of sweeping atmospheric beauty in an instant of musical grandeur, brought to artistic actualization through the band's fantastic ability of channeling the exact emotional experience of yearning for tranquility in a world where our hopes are threatened by the very fabric of the universe, in dark yet enchanting songs that invite the listener into an experience to be deeply felt and contemplated, screaming the universal torment of existence in one ear while whispering the bliss of nothingness in the other, leaving the heart and mind to engage in vigorous dialogue in an attempt to find a meaningful resolution.
0307341550|4.0|I just finished Sharp Objects moments ago. This book has excellent character development. This book has ended without leaving me. This, for me, is what my all time favorite novels share. I so agree with what the great Stephen King says about Gillian Flynn's debut novel: \\"...the story just stayed there in my head, coiled and hissing...\\".  The last third of this book delivered what would have been an incredibly satisfying climax only to deliver another that blew me away. Read this book. Be patient. The character and plot development takes time but it is worth it. I can't wait for more by Gillian Flynn!
B003TVMIDO|5.0|I was never a huge John Lennon fan, but hey - how can any self-respecting music lover not be a John Lennon fan? And, since I didn't have any of his solo CDs, the release of this gorgeous discography to commemorate what would have been his 70th birthday was the perfect excuse to catch up.<br /><br />John Lennon was with us for 40 years, and we've lived without him for 30. And then this box comes along and reminds us of it all. The box itself is somewhat outsized, and much bigger than you need to hold 10 CDs. It is all white, with the word &#34;LENNON&#34; emblazoned in blue sky/cloud motif on top of all that white. When you slip slide the top of the box off (tight, the way an iPhone box would breathe open mid-pace), you see a greeting:<br /><br />FROM<br />YOKO<br />JULIAN<br />SEAN<br /><br />Personal messages from the three surviving Lennons. Below that is a hardcover book, white with the word &#34;Yes&#34; emblazoned on it in blue. The booklet has an essay and photos.<br /><br />Below it are John Lennon's eight CDs, and one singles and rarities collection:<br /><br />Each of them contains a thick and glorious booklet that include photos, essays and lyrics.<br /><br />Once your fantasy has taken in all this glorious media, you can note the side of the inner box, which has a nice portrait of John and Yoko (full body) on one side, and an abstract concept of their faces on the other.<br /><br />Finally, at the bottom, there's a drawer that contains a gorgeous print of a drawing of John and Yoko sitting under a tree. Nice.<br /><br />The square white book that comes with the set is a gorgeous little thing, with the word &#34;yes&#34; inlaid in blue in what seems to be John's handwriting. It contains 60 pages of photos and writings on John Lennon, with some lyrics, doodles and artwork. Many of the photos are of John and Yoko together, and there are some of John before he met Yoko; there are no pictures of John's two sons. John is in every picture in the book except a picture of a Ringo Starr album cover, inexplicably included here. There's a great picture of the bed-in that is followed by a pen drawing of the scene. My favourite picture is of John and Yoko at Giza, with the pyramids in the background. The essay is not bad, as it gives saucy quotes from John angry about people's expectations of him, or their poor opinions of Yoko (and, by extension then, of him too), but it also re-tells some of the stories that are in the individual album booklets. Some of the typography is not great, as a few lines drift out of the left column. On pages 7, 11, 14, 15, 20, 44, 45, 48 and 56 this problem exists. Is this some sort of code? Sadly, there are no labels or credits for the pics and paintings. Neil Young Archives Volume 1 this ain't, but it's a work of art nonetheless.cture of a Ringo Starr album cover, inexplicably included here.

B000IJ79UW|5.0|I was a kid the last time I saw Superman. I'm in my 30s now and just watched it again and I loved it. I got chills several times throughout the movie, like when Christopher Reeve changes into Superman for the first time and saves Lois Lane falling from the helicopter. The famous Superman music starts playing and you get goosebumps. The entire backstory is told in this movie which is really nice, unlike the superhero movies of today. The special effects are actually pretty good for their time. I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end. Christopher Reeve was great and will always be the best Superman - tall, handsome, strong - it's such a tragedy what happened to him in real life. Can't wait to watch part II. Highly recommend!

0307887960|3.0|I've done Atkins before and it worked fast and worked well... but there was no lasting weight loss. I tried Dukan because I thought it might provide a lasting benefit and that my wife and I could both be on the same diet (she is not a fan of Adkins).  It is still early (1 month) and there has been some weight loss but both my wife and I have hit a plateau.  We'll see if we can get through this and get to our goals... and if we can keep it off.
0780620003|3.0|Initially, back when Spawn came out in theatres,i had never heard of it,let alone read a single comic book of the source material.But nevertheless, i was excited to see a comic book-based film other than Batman hit the screens.Sadly, i did not go to see it when it came out in august of 1997,but could not wait to see it still.When I finally did a couple months later on VHS, I was not dissapointed. However to this day, I think Spawn could have benefited from an R rating and more emphasis could have been placed on the action sequences(which were exciting but there should have been more).I would have thought that a sequel would come out in the years after but didn't.A sharp contrary when compared to Blade,which came out exactly 1 year after Spawn,and became a trilogy in no time at all.Even the actors and the acting(most importantly)held up-meaning it may have been a bit cartoonish, but never dumb and/or stupid.Lastly,it felt good to see for the first time an African-American superhero on the screen.P.S. the effects were great and the soundtrack(a mix of rock and electronica laced tracks)is a bonus if you liked the movie.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|Are you kidding me??  Is this seriously the best that we can do with a classic franchise like Star Trek?  The appetite that Americans have for this type of nonsense is depressing.  And the idolization of youth represented by this movie and far too many others of late is repulsive.  Raising children on a diet of Hannah Montana, iCarly, and Jonas Brothers, with a smartphone in their pocket in elementary school so they can check their Facebook page and tweet with their friends because \\"math is boring\\" is resulting in a generation of iKids who only worship themselves and mindlessly consume trash like this movie.
B00005JNS0|1.0|Over the past years I've seen and loved every Pixar film. When this originally came out, it just didn't look interesting to me. However, since Cars 2 is coming out, I thought I should finally watch this. I should have stayed with my initial feelings. This is the stupidest Pixar film ever. It looks pretty, sure, but the concept and story are strictly for 3 year-olds. There's nothing for the adult viewer here. The average Chevron commercial has a more entertaining story. This movie is literally sleep-inducing. But little kids who like mindless zooming things will love it.

B001794FOK|5.0|Jumper is the type of movie that touches our most internal dreams. Who would not want to jump anywhere in the world back and forth ?.<br /><br />The \\"bad guy\\" Samuel Jackson is terryfying and the actions scenss very imaginative.<br /><br />It did not get any OSCARS or prizes; it did not even did enought money for a sequel but the movie es PURE FUN which compared with you have in movies today is really a lot.
B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|I saw this when it was released and have wanted to own it ever since.  This is Kurosawa's great late masterpiece, a summing up of the themes in his entire oeuvre - war, power, self destruction, history - in an unforgettable retelling of Lear, but with deep references to Japanese culture.  I watched this with my son (12), both of us in a state of utter fascination at the panorama of life and death in this long film.  (He was full of questions!)  It was an utter delight.<br /><br />***spoiler alert***  I assume the reader knows the story already.<br /><br />The story takes place in the 16C or so, a time of upheaval and disorder worldwide.  An old war lord has spent his life ruthlessly crushing enemies nearby, stopping at nothing in his striving to dominate.  Perhaps as a result of his deteriorating mind, perhaps out of guilt at the terrible things he has done, he makes a catastrophically stupid decision - to divide the power of his armies between his sons in order to retire.  Only one son opposes this course of action, which his father finds violently offensive.  The son is banished, along with a faithful aide.<br /><br />Almost immediately, the two remaining sons begin to flex their muscles, first by humiliating their father - denying him access to their castles with his reduced entourage - and then by besieging him.  This is one of the most horribly graphic war scenes I have ever seen, hiding nothing of the blood and meaningless deaths.  The father begins to lose his mind, paralyzed in despair and appearing like a popular demon with his ashen face.  Once his forces are annihilated and his concubines have committed suicide, he stumbles out of the burning palace.  Having been rejoined by the faithful servant and the eunuch court jester, the only refuge he finds is in a filthy shack that houses a boy he blinded years before.  This is just one of the past crimes that revisits the war lord, who sees the irony through his psychotic despair.<br /><br />As soon as the sons are rid of him, they turn on eachother.  Here, there is a scheming wife, whose family we learn was murdered by  war lord soon after his son married her for the purposes of alliance.  She is a Shakespearean character, waiting years for revenge and then executing it at exactly the right time to perfection.  She sows destruction on an unimaginable scale.  As the war lord his last son, the faithful one, the tragedy is complete.<br /><br />This is one of the best films I have ever seen, by far the most intense war film.  Its psychology is also realistic, with the self-destructive decision of a father full of guilt.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.on eachother.

0307279189|5.0|The book was a page-turner for me and I've completed it twice.    I'm 49 years old and complete half-marathons in about 1:50. I transitioned to barefoot running very slowly over a period of 1 year. Very slow as in ....a quarter mile twice per week for two weeks, then a half mile twice per two weeks....you get the idea. In short order I doubled my weekly mileage and the chronic problems with shins and IT bands disappeared. On the coldest of Chicago winter days I wear a _very_ minimalist shoe which is more than enough to keep me warm while encouraging the gentle mid-foot landing required by being barefoot.    There are many interesting and credible sources for information on barefoot running. The best research appears to be at Harvard by Dr. Lieberman, However, my favorite \\"seal the deal\\" video is here: [...]  Note that I have absolutely no connection to \\"NJSportsMed\\".    Barefoot running, inspired by this book, has change my experience of distance running greatly for the better.    I enthusiastically recommend both this book and a VERY gradual transition to barefoot running.    Ken Florian

037582913X|4.0|This is one of my favorite books from childhood.  I recently bought a copy at a yard sale and discovered that some of the details of the story were missing.  Little golden books come in 32 page varieties (rarely anymore) and the more common 24 page variety.  I suspected that the one I had as a child was a 32 page version.  I promptly began searching for other people that remembered the missing details.  I was delighted to find several people that agreed with me.  (YAY! That means I'm not crazy! LOL)  I then started searching for a copy of the story with the missing pages included.  This listing claimed to have 32 pages! I was thrilled!!  But, alas, it only had 24.  :(<br /><br />I'm still delighted with the book. Since the little boy that I babysit has discovered it, and loves it, I sent this copy home with him. :)<br /><br />I'm still looking for a 32 page version (There was a steel door in it).  But I was still happy to be able to share this adorable story with my new little friend. :)

0800177975|3.0|Considered to be one of the biggest summer disappointments of 1993, Last Action Hero tried to get its name out there by being the next big name action flick, and it sure did disappoint many. Here's a thing to keep in mind though: this is actually a PARODY of the action genre that just happens to have Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. It's not trying to be a replica of the big names such as Terminator, Predator, or even Commando (which was unintentionally hilarious, by the way). Instead, it's an inside joke in the style of a sketch comedy skit, except it's drawn out much longer. While I personally don't think that Last Action Hero is terrible by any means, it doesn't mean that's it flawless.<br /><br />Arnold manages to play two characters in this film: the far more present cinematic world character Jack Slater, and the real life version of himself. He is obviously the reason why you would want to see this movie, and throughout the film, he makes fun of his stereotypical character by using over-the-top one liners and using unorthodox methods of action scenes. There's some hilarious jokes that he says throughout, and along with him, we even manage to see other film icons playing some of their trademark parts, including Robert Patrick dressed up as the T-1000, Sharon Stone's role as Catherine Tramell, and one of my personal favorites, Sylvester Stallone as The Terminator on a cardboard cutout. While I do enjoy the comedic, over-the-top bits that obviously point out the Hollywood cliches, this film suffers from drawing these out too long amongst its script. Sometimes they tend to be unnecessary and at others rather boring.<br /><br />Also, I found the child protagonist played by Austin O'Brien to be rather annoying. Part of me thinks that they used the idea of him teaming up with Schwarzy from T2, where Edward Furlong was the child protagonist. While Furlong was clever, funny and acted well, O'Brien tries too hard to be a mastermind behind the typical action film. I understand that the role of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.<br /><br />In a way, I tend to find Last Action Hero to be an enjoyable popcorn flick that tried something new by being a hidden parody. It was a major risk for director John McTiernan, screenwriter Shane Black (who ironically rewrote the script despite Zak Penn and Adam Leff having it a tongue-in-cheek reference to Black's style), and Arnold, but as a parody, it works. It's just a far cry from what we would expect from a cast like aforementioned.le of a child was necessary for this to work, seeing how he managed to magically appear in the movie with his favorite action hero, but it could have been done far better with someone that could pull it off in a far less annoying fashion.

B001AQMBJG|4.0|\\"...I'm Spartacus. You come to free the slaves or something?\\".-Clare Quilty (James Mason) to Humbert Humbert (Peter Sellars)The opening line is a rather tongue-in-cheek reference to Kubrick's previous film (which was more Kirk Douglas' film than his since he was brought on board after production had already commenced to replace director Anthony Mann)is also a perfect example of the humor of \\"Lolita\\".I've often thought that the opening exchange in \\"Lolita\\" refers as much to US as the audience as it does to the characters in the film (with the main characters being slaves to their own salacious desires and the power of a 14 year old girl played by Sue Lyon).<br /><br />Fidelity can be overrated. Lolita\\" manages to be a brilliant film because of the lack of fidelity to its source. Kubrick and Nabokov collaborated on the script which Kubrick promptly rewrote tossing half of the material making a Stanley Kubrick film in the process. Condemned at the time by the Catholic church (well, quite honestly, their newsletters would condemn 99% of the films out there as \\"morally objectionable\\" for one reason or another), \\"Lolita\\" holds up amazingly well as one of Kubrick's moral black comedies. Kubrick ended up making less a film of the novel and more a Stanley Kubrick film which became the approach for all of his films made from other sources.<br /><br />The new Blu-ray transfer looks exceptionally good; it is a fine upgrade over the original DVD with a crisper image, improved depth, deeper and richer blacks. Kubrick always excelled at black and white photography (he began as a still photographer professionally at the age of 16)and \\"Lolita\\" continued to demonstrate his exceptional ability in that area.<br /><br />The soundtrack sounds quite good as well with a nice mono transfer.<br /><br />My only complaint is that \\"Lolita\\" like ALL of Kubrick's films deserves to have supplementary material on the production of the film (some of the potential material we've seen in Jan Harlan's documentary \\"Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures\\"). A featurette on the production of the film along with the controversey, his working relationship with Vladimir Nabokov (the author later published the screenplay he worked with Kubrick on--it would have made a nice supplement here as well although it would have required licensing)and working with the actors would have been nice. A commentary track by a Kubrick scholar or someone who collaborated with him like Harlan or Michael Herr would have also been enlightening as well. Instead, all we get is the original theatrical trailer.<br /><br />I'd give the film itself five stars, the transfer looks quite nice so 4 1/2 and for supplementary material 1 star. I'd still recommend this but keep your ears open as to whether or not the film might receive a 50th anniversary upgrade at some point.<br /><br />Charolette: Do you believe in God?

B00005JLR8|5.0|The reason that I bought this movie was because I liked the song-and-dance in \\"West Side Story\\" entitled \\"In America,\\" and I thought, \\"Hmm, maybe this movie called \\"In America\\" is somehow a take-off on that song...\\"  Actually, I don't yet discern any great relatedness between that song and this movie, except that it is about a couple that emigrates to New York City and lives in poor circumstances.    An impoverished Irish couple and their two young daughters move to New York, illegally, from Canada.  They are running from the sore memory of a child that died, looking for a new life and prosperity.  The only place in the City they can find to live is a \\"junkie\\" building in Hell's Kitchen.  The movie makers depict it as looking reminiscent of the classic popular idea of a \\"haunted house,\\" but in the form of a gigantic apartment building.    If you \\"LOVE everything that LIVES\\"---to borrow a phrase from the movie---I think you will love this all-for-LIFE movie.    I felt it was slow to catch fire, so be patient until Halloween, when a surprising \\"devil\\" is revealed in the \\"haunted house\\" in this \\"Hell.\\"  Then, the story becomes very beautiful and its working out becomes emotionally gripping.    I had a very hard time understanding the dialogue.  The speech of the two little girls' was especially hard to comprehend.  I'm sure something was technically wrong with the film's audio.  Turning the sound up to level 45 helped a bit.    If you can't understand the words of the little girl's talk at the beginning of the movie, which sets some of the groundwork for the plot, I think I can tell you with some accuracy that she says something relating to the fact that she has a deal with her deceased little brother in Heaven that he will obtain answers to three wishes for her.      My DVD disc offered a choice of two versions of the movie.  I chose to watch the full-screen version on Side A that had no scenes cut.      Even though the story was set in the \\"mean streets\\" of Hell's Kitchen, there was only one F word and no other language that might be offensive to some viewers.  There was one sex scene done in an abstract and somewhat explicit way with minimal nudity.  Except for those two incidents, it really could almost pass as a \\"family film.\\"  ---It does deal just a little bit with explicit themes of Faith, so if you object to that, don't watch it!    It seems this film was declared \\"Movie of the Year\\" in 2005.  In my opinion, it deserves great accolades.  It's a well-acted, moving story!  I was very touched by the character of Matteo, a big guy with a big heart, whom the movie maker compares (in a good-bye moment) with a certain famous, lovable, small movie character: ET.  I will be re-watching this movie to tap greater depth of meaning and to pick up more dialogue.  The greatest charm and beauty of this movie is the children and the child-likeness in the theme it conveys.    The loss of a child often seems to produce a separative effect for a couple that undergoes that kind of emotional crisis.  Possibly this movie has the potential to offer some particular healing for people who've suffered in that way.
B004A8ZWTW|5.0|I just saw Jane Eyre and I was so impressed with how this version turned out. It truly was a bold vision. Michael Fassbender and Mia Wasikowska sizzled as Rochester and Jane. I also loved how the movie further explored the gothic aspects of the novel that previous versions have not paid as close attention to. The acting was excellent, not only from the two leads, but the supporting cast as well, especially Judy Dench, Jamie Bell, and the young actresses who played Jane as a child and her best friend Helen. The cruelty and abuse shown towards children at Jane Eyre's childhood boarding school greatly disturbed me. The movie also did a good job of making Rochester more of a sympathetic character. He deceives Jane, but because he loves her and does not wish to be parted from her due to social convention. I pitied him, like Jane, because there were no options back then for the mentally ill and I understand that he did not want to put Bertha in an insane asylum. This movie made me admire Jane even more because she stayed true to her convictions and respected herself. She may have been tempted to stay with Rochester, but knew that in good conscience she could not do so. When Rochester and Jane reunite in the end, I was brought to tears. Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and now it is one of my favorite movies, as well.

This book is filled with information and provides practical advice on building a sustainable practice for both yourself or your students, with inspirational photos and information on postures from easy to advanced.  All aspects of teaching are covered from sequencing, creating a mood for your class, working safely with students, etc., Mark Stephens has done a great job in this comprehensive, organized, easy to read book.    I teach yoga, and find myself coming back to this book again and again.  Highly recommended!
0679735909|5.0|I am a lover of non-fiction. Reading is not a pastime: it is a practical use of unassigned time. Not really, but I am often forced to treat whatever free reading time I have that way. I am either reading to improve my standing at work or to catch up on work. Reading for pleasure was lost to me for a long time. Possession reminded me that poetry brings life to life. Poetic and beautiful, Possession restarted my love of fiction.  I don't remember why I picked this book up; I don't recall why I would have wanted to try something so far from my general tastes, but I am glad I turned those pages. The experience for me was much like being in high school and reading A Tale of Two Cities or some other classic. Excitement! Words and thoughts have the power to make both your heart and soul fly. The experience of finding a novel in which an author says something that you wish you could have said is thrilling. Possession delivers that experience, but some of the critics on this page don't like the device the author uses to shade our sense of time, depth of the relationships, and feelings for the characters. They consider it a trick. No, there is only one literary trick here - the authors ability to lose the reader in lives of the characters. The writing is fluent and fluid; the relationships are clear and sound. In fact, this novel sounds all the right notes. I returned to a number of novels that I had attempted but was unable to complete after reading this book. I re-read Elisions'' Invisible Man and Toomers Cane with a new appreciation. Those volumes are not at all similar to Possession but I became excited about reading for pleasure and so I went over familiar ground. I am glad that I did; the books were better the second time around. There is a trend in the titling of how to books that tends towards names like \\" Reading Like a Professor,\\" or \\" Reading like a Writer'. Reading like a lover of good writing, great books, and a lover of Literature is what I am interested in.   Thank you Byatt for reminding me of love of pleasure I get from reading for pleasure.
B000000OUJ|5.0|This is a review that I am writing 15 yrs after a friend forgot his copy in my cd player of my'84 Chevy hatchback. The album is just plain sick and still to this day doesn't even measure up to todays Hip-Hop or as I like to call it,'Hip-Pop'. I really don't know what there is too say about a perfect album, other that it's perfect and nothing comes close to GZA's as well as the Wu members style and RZA's sick Kung Fu beats. I could go on forever in a 5 page review and breakdown everything that is great about it,but I'll let all of you just take my word for it.

All that we fans have come to love is offered on \\"In Your Dreams.\\"  We travel through her sphere with prose that is perfection.  More than enjoying the melodies, one is whisked into other worlds that enchant in \\"Wide Sargasso Sea,\\" \\"New Orleans,\\" \\"Moonlight(A Vampire Dream)\\" and \\"Italian Summer.\\"  An homage to Poe is proffered in \\"Annabel Lee.\\"  Lindsay Buckingham harmonizes on \\"Soldier's Angel\\" and I suspect is a muse for \\"Everybody Loves You.\\"  Dave Stewart, formerly of the Eurhythmics\\" offers his voice to harmonies especially in the upbeat tempo \\"Cheaper Than Free.\\"  Each song is worth the listening; I can't seem to stop.  I play endless \\"Literati\\" so I may listen without guilt. *smile*    This is a brilliant compilation from a woman that shares her ghosts and demons without apology. I rarely ever write reviews for CD's(and I am sure it shows) but my heart says, \\"don't be selfish; share the good news that Stevie has gifted another jewel to her subjects.\\"    A P.S. of sorts....the quality of the musicians that support her is astounding.  Everyone that played instruments on this album should be commended.  In \\"Moonlight\\" there are violins that nearly scream, dazzling me into a frenzy.  Stevie  chooses the finest to surround her worlds of fancy.

1400079144|4.0|The Lost Symbol is the 3rd in Dan Brown's Robert Langdon series. The story goes over 24 hours and starts with Langdon being flown by private jet to Washington to give a lecture as a favour to his long-time friend (and Mason), Peter Solomon. Soon enough, this turns out to be a ruse, and Langdon finds himself at the Capitol's Rotunda where Solomon's severed and tattooed hand is left by a mysterious man. Langdon's expertise as a symbologist is demanded to find and solve legendary Masonic Pyramid. The CIA are involved, and soon the action hots up. This book is (of course, as a Robert Langdon novel) filled with symbols, codes and puzzles, religious icons, lots of technology, chases and escapes, a seemingly invincible villain who is not what he seems, plot twists, apparently impossible resurrections and a virtual travelogue of Washington DC. There are some obvious flaws, and we are asked to believe that some characters will bizarrely put up with lengthy and unnecessary inconvenience. It is fiction, after all. But it is, nonetheless, exciting and fast moving. There are many facts about Washington and Masons and Ancient Mysteries. I couldn't get the image of Tom Hanks out of my head for Robert Langdon, although he really doesn't fit this description. I thought the climax was a bit anti-. Entertaining, all the same.

B0013N4AT0|4.0|First, let me say that I rated this album four stars ONLY by comparison to Opeth's later works.  As it stands on its own, Still Life is wonderful and incredible.    It's heaviest tracks are phenomenal in scope and sonic rage.  It's lighter, acoustically-driven tracks (like Benighted and Face of Melinda) are complex and satisfying.    I do believe that this track seems to lack the overall coherency of Ghost Reveries, Deliverance, Blackwater Park, and Watershed, for example.  Though all of those albums had softer moments, they all flowed together nicely.  Still Life has a more jarring pace in my opinion; it's mix of lighter and heavier tracks never felt quite ordered to me, leaving me guessing as to what mood I was really in, what kind of music I really wanted to hear.    I would also submit that, while a solid track, Serenity Painted Death is about as close to standard death metal fare as Opeth has ever approached.  It's not that it's bad, by no means; it's just not as moving to me as their other offerings.    Still Life proves a great transition for Opeth from the earliest albums to the later, showing the incredibly dense complexity of which they were capable, without completely reaching that Blackwater Park moment.  If you're already a fan of Opeth, then you will not be disappointed with this album, I promise; I know my review may seem harsh, but I'm a big fan of this album.  Believe me: four stars for an Opeth album equates to five stars by any other artist.    If you're not quite sold on Opeth yet, and you're wondering where to start, I would recommend Blackwater Park or Watershed, or Ghost Reveries/Deliverance if you're already into death metal.
0307946711|4.0|First, let it be said that this novel definitely has a European flair to it, as this is where it is set.  As for for the storyline and writing, it really hits its mark at times, but falters at others.  The novel is split into different parts, profiling the characters lives throughout the years.  (I didn't really care so much for the late twenties part - it just didn't connect with me for various reasons.)  It seems that there is a lot of nostalgia in the book, but not enough sentiment.    The premise is engaging (looking in on the characters on the same day every year), but I felt the author could have done more with it.
B00008OLYN|5.0|OK, first off, if you're ONLY into brutal death metal, and completely uninterested in lyrical content, then skip this purchase.  There are NO growled vocals, no crushing guitar riffs or blast beats.    If, however, you're a more normal human being, then this review is for you.    Another reviewer used the word \\"masterpiece\\" to describe this album, and I cannot agree more.  Really, the only fault I can find is that Damnation and Deliverance are misleading titles for the softer and heavier albums of the pair, respectively.    Damnation is just as dense and complex as other Opeth albums, yet it is an acoustic and lyrical journey.  It's lyrical content is often dark, creepy, and depressing, which is more intimate and personal with the musical presentation.  Just because the music is soft doesn't mean that this isn't still a death metal band at its core, and the lyrics reflect that.    If you're already an Opeth fan, then chances are you aren't turned off by their softer content.  Buy this album.  If you're not an Opeth fan, then this is a great album to whet your appetite (assuming the first paragraph of this review did not apply to you).    This album would also make a great gift for people who enjoy rock (softer rock or otherwise), jazz, or...hell, virtually anything.  If you want to introduce someone to heavier music, but don't want to scare them off with death growls and blast beats, you could easily do worse than this offering.
0345410025|5.0|When my daughter was 11, she came home from school very upset because of a homework assignment she was just given and which was due the next day.  The assignment was to memorize the names of the 50 states and to locate them on a map.  I had been reading The Memory Book and decided to see if one of the techniques could help my kid. Within half an hour she had the assignment completed and aced it the following day in class.  Worked for her and works for me (but I'm rusty - and old - and have just purchased my 3rd copy - the other two I gave away to my nieces).
B000FZESY4|5.0|If you're considering buying some (or some more) Opeth, there's nothing that I can write in this review that someone else has not already written.  So I will focus on this album as compared to the rest of their catalog.    Ghost Reveries has some of the heaviest music Opeth has produced to date, with Ghost of Perdition and the Baying of the Hounds uncompromisingly, blisteringly heavy.  Really, this album doesn't let up until the beautifully relaxing Atonement.    That doesn't mean that any of these songs lack the complexity of tracks from Still Life or Deliverance.  You'll find surprising moments, moving moments, harmonically dense moments in every single track.  Some of their creepiest and most unsettling riffs and lines can also be found here - notably in, but most definitely not restricted to, the Grand Conjuration.    Harlequin Forest is easily one of my favorite Opeth tracks, ranking right up their with Bleak as an absolutely perfect song.  It could not be improved in any way.  Though it has a not-insubstantial quantity of death growls, more than half of the song is comprised of clean vocals, and some fantastically groovy beats throughout.    Lyrically, this is one of Opeth's darkest entries, and one that fits most comfortably within the death metal paradigm.  Of course, their music alone does not; if Rush decided to play death metal instead of prog rock, I think Opeth would be a pretty natural result.  Anyway, the lyrics are not for those who are easily offended by the occult.    If you are looking for a damn solid album by Opeth, there are other options that I think work just as well, but you will NOT go wrong with Ghost Reveries.
0761536434|5.0|The Ultimate History of Video Games by Steven L. Kent is a comprehensive and enjoyable account of the development of our favorite industry. From the days of coin-op mechanical games and pinball, all the way through the launch of the PS2, Kent covers the maturation of the industry in incredible detail. Weighing in at nearly 600 pages, Kent leaves no stone unturned and no detail left out. However, while the book is dense with information and admittedly lengthy, it manages to read much more like a fast-paced story than a tediously plotted history text.     This readability is no doubt thanks to the book's greatest asset: it is straight from the horse's mouth. The book is littered with quotes directly from the people within the industry, and nearly every page features at least one or two block quotes. These are not low-level QA testers or programmers, but the very men who helped to shape the industry: Ralph Baer, Nolan Bushnell, Shigeru Miyamoto, and Hideo Kojima to name just a few. Along with a foreword by Peter Molyneux, these firsthand accounts lend the book immediate credibility, as you are never left wondering where a certain bit of information came from, or what the people involved actually thought at the time - it is right there in front of you.    Another asset working in the book's favor is that Kent never bogs you down with company detail after company detail, but rather, weaves both the business side of the industry in with the personal side, allowing much space for hilarious anecdotes and tangential stories from the men themselves. Whether it's a story of Bushnell riding around on a conveyor belt when company executives show up, or members of the Xbox design team almost killing themselves by overcrowding an elevator, Kent spends as much time making you laugh as he does informing you. The only part of the book that slowed down was a large chapter surrounding a number of court battles that spanned the 1970s-90s, though even there, an anecdote or two elicited alaugh.      If there were any criticism that I could lay against the book, it is that it only covers up until 2000, just after the launch of the PS2 and as GameCube and Xbox are in development (by no fault of the book itself as it had to be published sometime). Personally, while I would have liked to learn more about the development of the newer consoles and personalities, this didn't bother me too much since I have followed the industry more closely since the mid-2000s and know much of this information already.    Overall, Kent's book is exactly what the subtitle says it is: the story behind the craze that touched our lives and changed the world. Whether you're a history buff who happens to like games, someone hoping to one day work in the industry, or just a gamer with an appreciation for the industry, you owe it to yourself to read The Ultimate History of Video Games. You won't regret it.    Below are just some of the people interviewed in the book:    Nolan Bushnell, founder, Atari and Chuck E. Cheese  Minoru Arakawa, president, Nintendo of America  Howard Lincoln, chairman, Nintendo of America  Gumpei Yokoi, designer, Game Boy  Kaz Hirai, president, Sony Computer Entertainment of America  David Rosen, cofounder, Sega  Peter Moore, former president, Sega of America  Trip Hawkins, founder, EA and 3DO  Alan Miller, cofounder, Activision and Accolade  Greg Fischbach, president, Acclaim  John Romero, cofounder, id Software  Masaya Nakamura, founder, Namco  Hironobu Sakaguchi, president, Square USA  Shigeru Miyamoto, creator, Donkey Kong, Mario, Zelda, et al.  Hideo Kojima, creator, Metal Gear  Ed Boon, creator, Mortal Kombat  Yuji Naka, creator, Sonic the Hedgehog  Toru Iwatani, creator, Pac-Man  Alexey Pajitnov, creator, Tetris  Joel Hochberg, cofounder, Rare Ltd.

B00005YUBL|4.0|There's a lot to like in this classic and highly acclaimed set. Wolfgang Sawallisch delivers a powerful, majestic Schumann, with plenty of rough-edged lyricism. He strikes a fine balance of expansiveness and clarity. Tempos are fairly well judged, but Sawallisch does push the pace too much at times, and often strives for bigness, bordering on aggresive/overbearing, and the orchestral play also suffers. At other times, Sawallisch opts for grandness and some legato that is too polished and smooth for my taste. The recorded sound is a huge plus. It is phenomenal, big and vivid with wonderful ambience. The highlights are the Second and Third, both outstanding interpretations that rank among the best. The Fourth is rushed and a bit sloppy. The First is acceptable but overheated and quite rushed (but this is not uncommmon among interpretations of the First).    This set is comfortably among the top options, even though it lacks the special spirit and quality of the cycle of George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra, which to me remains a benchmark. Besides Szell's, few full Schumann cycles nail all four symphonies, although conductors Jerzy Semkow, Armin Jordan, Antoni Wit, Kubelik, Inbal, Herreweghe have delivered sets with some strong performances. Recordings of individual symphonies by Furtwangler (First and Fourth) and Fricsay (First) are essential and some others, such as Hans Zender, Michael Schonwandt (with Danish Radio), Gunter Wand, Paul Kletzki, Paul Paray, etc. are noteworthy.
B004OKFIQI|4.0|Ok, so after all this controversy on this and the evil 'EU' edition, I got Steve Huffman's version-this one-and played it  back to back with the 'EU' version. My verdict?........ except for the difference in 'Gold Dust Woman' The two versions sound soooooooo  close it's not even funny! Really! Now what sounds completely different is the SH 33rpm version, that one is in your face, and the 45rpm  sounds Nothing like that! In Fact, I had to do a double a/b to see if I didn't re-purchase the EU version!!  So, as I said before, the EU version is Exquisite! And so is the Huffman version AT the 45rpm speed. Now, can we all just  get along and down a few brews?????  Gerard Masters
B001AQT0OU|5.0|In 75 Barry Lyndon by Kubrick hit the screens ... [...] ... and eventually became a long favorite ... the natural light and special lenses, built by the Carl Zeiss company for NASA, created fantastic visuals that never looked as good until this welcome blu-ray disc ... the wonderful sound and music are also as great ... This is a perfect film that took a beating from some antsy critics and fans like myself. Ryan O'Neal as the ne'er-do-well lead was one challenge; however a masterstroke of casting that works as well as the incredible attention to detail and style. Deceptively slow paced with more power than a locomotive. awesome BD ...
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A superb job at explaining the complex OTC derivatives market. Illustrates the destructive potential of unregulated market forces. Exposes collusion at the highest academic levels of economic departments at major colleges and universities.

B001R4MEUC|4.0|This is one of genesis'finest albums probably second in accomplishment behind the Lamb. It showcases P.G at a time of very high creative power and the group in fine fettle.From the opening song to the closing musical furore that segues to the reprise of Moonlight knight this album seems to have a kinetic energy that gives it a weight above it individual components.  There seems to be a good heart at work behind the scenes.  I wish todays artists were able to be as ambitious as these guys were and musicians in general from this era.  Until they become so again though, this eras artistic genius set in Hi FI aspic will keep on providing me with enjoyment.
1452101248|5.0|[[ASIN:1452101248 Plenty: Vibrant Recipes from London's Ottolenghi]]      I consider this book my \\"ideal\\" cook book. It provides a handful good tasting recipes, many good quality pictures of ready dishes and the author at work, which is also nice because makes the book intimate. The recipes are written very well, the descriptions are easy (I assume, by an inexperienced cook as well) to follow. There is no long introduction and `how to' sections; just recipes, one per page, each with a brief introduction that brings the mood of the dish and gives explanation why some specific ingredients were chosen (highly valuable reading if one wants to go inside the cook's creative world). The binding, the paper and the cover are of superb quality, meaning that the book will last forever and can be used directly in the kitchen.    There are 120 recipes all together in the book. They were adapted by the author from all over the world and reflect no specific tradition but the author's taste and culinary vision, which are pretty consistent throughout the whole book and which therefore make this book `The cook book' rather than a simple collection of recipes. Two of the recipes can be tried as they have been published in the New York Times (that would be nice if Amazon could do the same). I am sure that if you like any of them, you will like the other recipes in the book too. So far, I have tried about a dozen of recipes and my family gave them all five stars, while I had to modify some recipes to make them vegan and downplay calories.     Note to vegans and those who watch calories. While all recipes in the book are vegetarian, roughly half of them are vegan or can be easily modified to become vegan, while the other play heavily around eggs and cheese and are hard or impossible to modify without damaging the author's idea. Be aware, some recipes contain too many fat and calories (one of the reasons they taste so good!). For example, \\"Pasta and fried zucchini salad\\" that was published in the NYT, contains more than 600 calories per serving without counting mozzarella (this is based on my calculations that can be found on my web site, where I also posted several tried recipes with my modifications). But... I must confess, I had never tasted so amazing pasta!

B000002GB2|5.0|The 70's and 80's provided me easy access to some good bands, some bad bands, and those Rolling Stone approved. My favorite review was of Queen \\"Queen is the second-best band in the world...everyone else is number one..\\". While praising the ingenuity, and let's face it..over and over, of Bowie, Lou Reed, Springsteen, even John Lennon's very average solo albums post-Imagine, they completely missed the mark on those bands whose lyrics may have been piled with corn occasionally--but where that failed, the sound made the connection.    Alan Parsons \\"I Robot\\", The Raspberries (listen to Springsteen's indebtedness on \\"Go All The Way\\"), and yes...Styx. As another reviewer has mentioned, I'll pretend \\"Mr Roboto\\" was Dennis DeYoung's vanity project and move on, but here on \\"Equinox\\" a perfect blend of sound and space are on exhibit. Short album, each song builds (nothing personal Tommy Shaw, but without Dennis--Styx is nothing more than Foreigner, Kansas, Molly Hatchett, and the current Styx tour etc.)    Listen to the \\"quality music\\" coming out of 1975 and tell me this over-the-top and fun (it's ok to admit this) cd was a less-than musical experience. Besides, how many of us really have to put on that Bowie or Reed cd for the long road trip...Zeppelin sure..Styx? Why not...five stars from me anyway.
030726999X|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" was for me the most uneven of the trilogy.  Larsson's novel does not really start picking up until around page 300, when Blomkvist hooks up with yet another woman, this time a bodybuilder ex-cop who joins a government police force.  But I'm getting a bit ahead of myself.<br /><br />The first part of the novel picks up where the last one left off with Salander, after having been shot in the head is flown to the hospital and put through surgery.  And her father Zalachenko, who somehow survived her axe attack, is sent to the same hospital!<br /><br />Larsson's characters are really interesting in how he writes them.  I mean he'll write practically a full biography.  If we meet his character in the bathroom, say, then we can be assured of the brand of shaving cream and who owns the building.<br /><br />Despite this maddening detail, the book is an interesting one, once you plow through all the unnecessary history of Swedish politics.<br /><br />To summarize briefly, the reader knows of a secret organization within the secret police of Sweden called The Section, or as Blomkvist calls it, the Zalachenko Club.  They can't seem to deal with the current crisis so they call in old spies from the 1960s, one on dialysis and the other dying of cancer, who both feel they have nothing to lose and so proceed to take over and push their weight around.  They are above the law.<br /><br />Larsson criticizes incompetence in many ways as well as writing to what extent the quirkiness of his characters will take them.<br /><br />Several points of interest:<br /><br />The author makes a big deal of Salander's part of the brain getting damaged by a bullet but that damage only pertains to her mathematical ability.  She can no longer remember some math theorem eluded to in the second book.  Nothing is really made of this.<br /><br />Second, a story within a story I found fascinating, with Berger's new appointment to SMP, how the reader is lead to believe that her stalker is one of the crew of her new paper, but we are shocked as to whom it turns out to be.<br /><br />Third, the book really picks up when we see Blomkvist's journalistic muscles flex, and Salander's return to the computer to hack her way to freedom from threats and false accusations.<br /><br />Larsson's Criticisms:<br /><br />Much is made of the media and its propensity to grab a news story, usually on the back of someone else's work, and run with it, making things up as they go along.  Salander was painted by the media to be some kind of lesbian Satanist if you could believe that!<br /><br />Larsson also criticizes the arrogant presumptions of those in authority:  the police detective at the beginning, who does not believe Blomkvist's assertions and through the cop's incompetence let's a murderer go free.<br /><br />Or Teleborian, a psychiatrist to whom others worship and can do no wrong, until Salander's hacking crew find some interesting photos on his laptop!<br /><br />Or Clinton, the spy ring master, who feels those around him are incompetent and soft and starts a murder spree across Sweden.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Worthy continuation from the second book.  Many points are finally wrapped up but it takes some time to wrap them.  Even the escape of the murderer at the start of the story is not even confronted until the end of the book!<br /><br />Strong women pepper the book in a positive way:  Figueroa, Berger, Giannini (Blomkvist's lawyer sister) and Salander all show some aspect of women that is prideful and fascinating as they make their way through a Swedish man's world.<br /><br />And the Blomkvist womanizing, journalistic genius and Salander's hacking skill from the first book is reprised here, which is what made the book interesting.<br /><br />Ah, now if we could only have edited out about 200 pages of Swedish politics!<br /><br />Suggestion:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307595579 Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Deluxe Boxed Set: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, Plus On Stieg Larsson]]<br />[[ASIN:1844549402 The Man Who Left Too Soon: The Biography of Stieg Larsson]]<br />[[ASIN:0312610564 The Tattooed Girl: The Enigma of Stieg Larsson and the Secrets Behind the Most Compelling Thrillers of Our Time]]he Man Who Left Too Soon: The Biography of Stieg Larsson]]  [[ASIN:0312610564 The Tattooed Girl: The Enigma of Stieg Larsson and the Secrets Behind the Most Compelling Thrillers of Our Time]]
B000025XKM|5.0|Pink Moon is the one of the most revealing folk/singer-songwriter records out there..which is odd, because the lyrics are impenetrably nonsensical. I think the reason Pink Moon is such an emotionally stirring record are Drake's melodies and the intimate recording style; as well, the strange guitar tunings provide the mystique necessary to buffer the lyrics' surrealist imagery. The magic of this album is in it's less-is-more approach that conveys Drake's mental state at the time. A fitting elegy for one of folk-rock's most talented, and troubled, songwriters.

I've sinced purchased a pre-Apple-fiasco Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1, and it runs just fine. I've played the hell out of PvZ on the PC, and it's just as much fun on a tablet.

B004EWFUQY|5.0|After a friend of mine told me about her brother shed of his 20 pounds in just 30days, I purchased the book right away, I have very strictly followed the instructions. In just 5 days I dropped about 7 pounds. Now I am on the second phase. I'm wondering how good the second one is , and since I introduce veggie back, my weight wasnt dropped everyday anymore. It is not easy to follow especially the pure protein, but the second phase is easier to follow, and I hope I can get to the third one in just the next two months. My goal is 26 pounds to get to my ideal weight of 160 pounds. It is not easy, but if I can get rid of my unwanted fat and stabilize my ideal weight i would do it in a heart bits. I have put on weight in about ten years, to see the pounds melt away everyday is really a motivation. There are many blogs and forums on internet, and it would cost you nothing to do except switching from a regular yogurt to a zero fat Greek yogurt. :))<br /> I am living in Columbus Ga, USA, and i can get the oat bran and Greek yogurt at The Fresh Market.<br /><br />Good luck with your weight lose
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Game runs smoothly and looks decent... but some of the graphics are blurry because the game is stretched to fit Android screens, such as the 4.3 in screen on my Thunderbolt.  Overall it is still worth the purchase but not perfectly designed for Androids...

B004QYZATW|4.0|I almost did not watch this movie because people put it down so much.  But I'm glad I did because it was entertaining and just seeing Angelina so glamorous was a treat.  I think people expected this movie to be action-packed, like most of her films and that Johnny Depp would be some kind of swash-buckling hero like he is in Pirates.  I don't like actors being pigeon-holed into roles and I'm glad they made this movie because it was clever and funny and must have been just a cool and not so demanding project for them.  The story is believable, they both acted well, the scenery was to die for.<br /><br />People also made comments that there was no chemistry between them.  But if you look at the story, Depp's character was supposed to be an awkward, depressed math teacher and Jolie's a sophisticated woman of the world.  It was all part of the weave of the plot that this is so.  It all makes sense in the end.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars because there were some parts that I found holes in the story but otherwise, I don't regret watching this movie.

B004G600A4|5.0|I'm in my forties and I watch animated films to chill out.  Tangled got me laughing and it was a good interpretation of the Rapunzel story, although there were a lot of changes.  The animation is superb, the color so vivid, making some scenes look like they were real. The characters of Flynn, Rapunzel, and Maximus were so cute and funny! I was glad that the writers did not make Flynn turn out to be a prince. That would be so predictable. I highly recommend this to anybody, young and old.
B002ZG997M|5.0|I will not go into a 500 word thesis on this movie.  All I will say is that 1: It is very entertaining, 2: The acting is top notch, 3: The story line keeps you interested throughout, 4: Lots of righteous violence, 5: Excellent ending.  Denzel slam banged this role and it seemed to come naturally to him because of his great acting.

I only tried it because it was Amazon's Free App of the Day.  I started the wifi download figuring I would try out and delete it.  When it finally finished I tried it out.  I was immediately impressed with the graphics.  I started playing and was sucked in by the strategic game play.  I found myself playing for hours (or so it felt like that to my wife).  After playing this for a few days, I've come to the realization that this app is well worth paying for.  $3 is a great deal for a high caliber game like this.

B0041KKYEW|4.0|Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan can either be viewed as one of the most harrowing declines of an artist in recent memory or an exercise in high camp. Either way you view it this is one of those films that needs to be seen.    Nina ( Natalie Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica ( Barbara Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy ( Vincent Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Winona Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Mila Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.    This film was a breakthrough for Portman, who picked up the Oscar for best actress for her portrayal. She appears in every scene of the film and the performance is always engaging. Equally important is cinematographer Matthew Libatique's creepy hand held camera work which makes the entire film feel claustrophobic and more akin to a horror film than a a normal drama. This is a compelling film that may take several viewings to truly appreciate. The film is perhaps one of the darker offerings of the year also so don't go in expecting a pleasant ride.     The Blu Ray disc offers a great transfer. The original grainy feel produced from shooting with multiple types of camaras and film stocks is present making the film feel like an indie. The sound while not booming conveys the film's feeling quite well. Extra features inclue a fifty minute making of feature and  quite a few short promo type pieces.    Recommended
0143036238|5.0|I'm not really a big reader, I read books whenever I have time, plus I had seen the movie prior to reading the book, but friends who had read the book said I missed out on a lot so I decided to read the book anyways...and I would have to say, even though I knew the ending of the book, I still really enjoyed reading the book and definitely found myself wondering what might happen in the next chapter so the book still kept me in suspense.
0393327345|5.0|Like taking the world apart, and re-arranging it in a way that makes just as much sense as it did before, which is little to none. An odd and pointless way to view life, but the abstract truths that the book eludes to are much brighter than the dark overtones of the narrator. Certainly not a guide to life, but an interesting and puzzling version non the less. A must read for anyone who has ever questioned the norm or wondered how things would be different with a change in societal norms.

B0025X4OYI|5.0|The idea of integrating C&W repertoire into more mainstream pop-music was not new of course, no matter what producer Sid Feller may sweepingly state on the record sleeve. Examples abound of C&W being integrated in the repertoire of thirties' and forties' dance bands (Ray Noble's \\"Wagon Wheels\\" dates from 1934, Glenn Miller's \\"Call of the Canyon\\" from 1940, Vaughn Monroe waxed \\"Someday You'll Want Me to Want You\\" in 1949) and more recently, Nat Cole had recorded \\"There's a Goldmine In The Sky\\" in 1957 and \\"Cold Cold Heart\\" in 1961, combining \\"the lush strings of easy listening, big band brass and the beautiful simplicity of country music\\" (as one reviewer aptly described it) well before Ray Charles. And that these albums would \\"introduce another audience to country and western music\\" (quoting the same reviewer) is also highly contentious. I like C&W in the form it is presented here (or on the Bobby Darin album \\"You're The Reason I'm Living\\", to be released in 1963 [[ASIN:B000006ULQ You're The Reason I'm Living/I Wanna Be Around]]), but not even in my worst nightmare would I buy a \\"regular\\" C&W record.<br />That said, this CD contains 74 minutes of damn good music from the C&W repertoire (but definitely NOT in the C&W way of whining singers with obnoxious drawls, steel guitars and howling violins), excellently performed by some of America's top (jazz) arrangers (Marty Paich, Gil Fuller and Gerald Wilson), with some of the most soulful singing imaginable by the inimitable man himself. Sound quality is excellent, liner notes are informative, price is great, so if this isn't the best buy of the year my name ain't Conway Twitty no more.
B000002G27|5.0|This is a true \\"Greatest Hits\\" album. From the intro of \\"Summer Of '69 to the finale of \\"Please Forgive Me\\", it is a musical journey through Bryan's career from 1982's \\"Cuts Like A Knife\\" through 1991's \\"Waking Up the Neighbours\\". It focuses primarily on his 1985 Smash \\"Reckless\\". \\"Run To You\\" was the first song I heard of his. From the echoing guitar chords in the beginning to the fade out, it is a song of honesty, a confession of attraction in the midst of a deeply committed relationship. It is very saddening to hear how he longs to be with one woman while in a deeply committed relationship with another.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|this game is awesome. very entertaining. however there are some major bugs to be worked out. the game has frozen on me several times and has lost my user data twice now, resulting in me having to completely start over from the beginning. so not cool. i have never heard of this happening while the game was in the apple market. must be something about putting this game in the.android technology. different software, new bugs. so disappointing because i love this game so much
B00002Z88E|5.0|A live double album of Metallica's greatest hits along with The Michael Kamen Conducted San Francisco Symphony. Classic favorites like \\"Master Of Puppets\\" and \\"Enter Sandman\\" get a fresh new treatment with lush orchestrations. There are also two new songs, \\"No Leaf Clover\\" (my personal favorite all time song), and \\"Minus Human\\". The set starts of with Ennio Morricone's epic \\"Ecstasy Of Gold\\" (Which is Metallica's concert prologue song) from \\"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly\\" (1966), and ends with a rousing finale of \\"Battery\\" (The first song on \\"Master Of Puppets\\" (1986).). It actually has three elements: Metallica, SF Symphony, and The Audience. All three add texture to each of the songs that is amazing considering not only each entity, but the pieces of each of those entities. Visit the website at [...].
0307454541|5.0|You gotta really love to read to love this book.  The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is written from the point of view of two people.  There are two protagonist through the series and if you don't keep up with the people that they speak with, if you skim, you will get lost.<br />The book is disturbing.  It has one of the two most disturbing rape scenes ive ever seen in a book.  You may want to skim over that part.  Alot of people find it hard to stomach and i am one of those people.  i didnt skim through it but afterward i wish i had.<br />This story is a kin to stories like silence of the lambs. This guy did not work with limits.<br /><br />the book starts slow for the first 200 pages or so.  It tells you every little detail and talk talk talk talk talk going on in mikaels life.  then you find yourself downright captivated by it.<br />On to what i loved about it.  Its downright engrossing. I fell into lisbeths spell. This is a story within a story. its the story of an old man trying to find out what happend to a young girl in his family years ago and the two people hired on to find out, during which stumbeling into a serial killer.<br />its also the story of a young woman who has lived a horrible life and a playboy (people try to make him into some good guy which he is oh man, this guy is a good friend) with a heart of gold. -he simply cant keep in in his chinos- and how the struggle goes with him trying to break down the wall she has carefully built to protect herself so that he can be her friend. -with benefits, lol-<br />once youve read it to the end, well, you see for yourself but after a tough ride with this book and all its gory little details i sat back on my bed, tossed the book onto the bed next to my foot, cracked a smile, kicked back and opened up The Girl Who Played With Fire (yes on the same night), i just couldnt wait to see what happened next.<br />by the way the books get better as the series goes by.  They also become moreso about lisbeths life.  The second deals with cracking down on more sexual abuse, this time with other people.

0143116738|5.0|The element has many wonderful elements within. I love this book, and am actually of fan of Ken Robinson as per his public speaking. I can get the register, of Ken, as I read this thoughtful and entertaining book.<br /><br />I also like to review and read reviews. I am astounded with the reviews that claim nothing is new here. I guess, for those whom hold a lot more knowledge than many, there is nothing new here. If you know everything - you will indeed find nothing new in this book. If you are so fortunate, to be in this category, please write a book - we would love to learn from you. I am very open-minded.<br /><br />If you have watched Sir Ken on Ted Talks, or on other shows, you will indeed find some repetition. If you have not seen these I would suggest reading the book first and watching the online videos later, it will be more rewarding (I guess). From drawing God, to choreographing Cats, and writing \\"Handle with Care\\", we can see how a range of people are successful in utilizing their \\"creative element(s)\\".<br /><br />The book is also for \\"21st Century Educators\\" interested in radical change, not reform, but change. His ideas may suggest radical departures from current and traditional models of Education, but by no means are \\"his\\" view radical. Prominent researchers at leading institutes suggest the exact same (see just two examples below). It makes sense in how technology is radically reshaping society. How could the \\"old\\" models for Education work, as he points out, in a much different day in age.

0143118706|5.0|EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT! Talk about some wake up calls!  This book explains Marriage all over the world through all the years, including Gilberts' herself. This book made me think about my marriage, my parents and my friends. It made me think deeper into myself, about my own wants and desires. About, why we think and do what we do, how everything is molded into TWO. This book was very inspirational. I think it would be great for any soon to be married or just married, and even someone like me that's been married for 11 years.  This book takes you past all those negative thoughts and lets you think for yourself. At least I did. I enjoyed how everything was well written and researched and wow'd me on all the information!  Need I say more?<br />Heather
0345529057|5.0|One of the best book series I have ever read, so well written and full of character!!!  I highly recommend everyone buying!  Also, for only $20 approx for the four, it's the best possible way to buy them!
B004TJ1H3C|4.0|This is not your typical stargate. In stargate universe the creators chose to focus on the characters and the situations that they would inevitably find them selves in rather than all of the adventures them selves. This is not to say that they don't go on adventures, they do, just not as often as in the previous stargate shows. The only reason that I have given this a 4/5 is because of the lack of an ending. While the ending does offer some closure, it leaves you wanting more. The final episode of this season is one of the best episodes of TV I have ever seen and is my favorite episode of stargate so far. I have watched every episode of every season and all of the movies. If this show has nothing else going for it, it has some of the best writing, directing, editing, and overall production quality that I have ever seen. Don't be turned off by the people saying not to buy it just because it doesn't follow in the footsteps of the previous stargate shows. Watch it for what it is, and enjoy the over the top production quality of this show.
B002ZG99CC|4.0|In many respects, The Karate Kid remake was successful its own way of retelling the story, although I also wondered why it wasn't named The Kung Fu Kid.   There were many good points about the film. One is simply exceptional scenery; the images of China, the language, customs and culture were all fantastic to view and experience, and make Dre's transition all the more real.  Jackie Chan gives a strong effort as Mr. Han, Dre's instructor. The 2010 version also makes substantial efforts (almost to a fault) to establish the relationship between Dre and Mr. Han, as first Dre doesn't understand the attitudes of respect and discipline but grows wiser. Even Will Smith's son, Jaden Smith, does a fair job in his role.     There were some drawbacks to the film, however. One was simply that the villains were a bit too prototype and over-the-top. For example, the master for the bullies comes across as an evil dictator type. Another problem was the film's length, which was just a shade under two and a half hours. Some parts of the story were a little too unnecessarily drawn out. For instance, Dre's adjustment when he first arrives in China could have been cut down a little, and it would still have given sufficient depth to the film. This causes the film to sporadically lose steam a little bit every now and then until the next major event in the plot.     Still, this version of The Karate Kid does a good job of trying to build characters and storyline and, for that, I commend it.  More importantly, it has the same spirit of the original, showing how honor is crucial in one's life, and how we can achieve goals through discipline and determination. The Karate Kid excels at this, and, although it is a bit darker in mood, a viewer can have an appreciation that it has its own great qualities.     So, it's possible to enjoy both versions.     The DVD also includes The Making of The Karate Kid.
B00005AXEL|5.0|I love this album. This follows in the same vein as Street Angel, just a little bit more, in that it's much more rock-music focused, whereas her efforts of the 80s where largely pop. It's all great, though.   Like I said, it's largely rock, but there are also pop oriented songs. For example, Every Day, Love Changes, Bombay Sapphires, and Love Is. There are also quite a few hard rock songs, most notably Fall From Grace, and perhaps even Trouble In Shangri-La and Planets Of The Universe, which is appropriate considering their moods.   Trouble In Shangri-La- title track, like I said a hard-rock song. It's a good song, and unique in that it's a follow-along song.  Candlebright- I can't say I've given this track much attention. It never really jumped out to me.  Sorcerer- Coolest sounding track on the album, hands down.  Planets Of The Universe- An edited version, but still retains the raging scorn. It's what attracted me to the album.  Every Day- A slower song that's good, but there is a much better slow song. This is good, though.  Too Far From Texas- The country song, duet with one of the Dixie Chicks. Sorry, I can't remember, and I'm not very acquainted with them at all. The song is nice.  That Made Me Stronger- The chorus of this song is what really jumps out at me. Other than that, not much to say.  It's Only Love- An acoustic song that's actually kind of nice.  Love Changes- Arguably the pop-iest song on the album, it's one of my favorites. Very nice.  I Miss You- Also one of my favorites, and one of Stevie's best love songs. It really captures the essence of missing someone, especially someone you really love. Heart wrenching.  Bombay Sapphires- One of the most interesting songs, it's good, too.  Fall From Grace- Arguably meaner and madder than Planets Of The Universe, Stevie really captures that essence.  Love Is- A collaborative effort with Sarah MacLachlan that sounds like her style as well, appropriately. Great closing song.    So yeah, this is a really goodalbum. The only reservation I have about this, and the only criticism is that she waited too long (7 years) between albums. I'm certain that she had her reasons, but that is probably what led this album to be underrated. I suppose that's her right as an artist, but it does her career no favors whatsoever.   Regardless, it's a great album, and highly recommended.
1591843790|5.0|I enjoy Guy Kawasaki's 'Enchantment' very much as it is written in a lighthearted & assertive manner. Kawasaki's insight is straightforward & particularly practical in the current digital era. The book can actually be viewed as 'How to win friends & influence people' for the digital era. I also adore the personal stories in the end of each chapter, which nicely recap the insight of the chapter in humane way.

1594484805|4.0|I enjoy books that challenge conventional wisdom coherently; Daniel Pink's 'Drive' is such a book. It is written in an entertaining & assertive manner. It is an easy read that is stocked with research & examples that illustrate how the theories are relevant to work place. I particularly enjoy the 'toolkit' section, which comprises of strategy & tactics to awake one's motivation, as well as to drive greater business performance. I also like the ideas regarding how parents & teachers can motivate & educate young kids more effectively.
B00004YTIQ|3.0|Well it fits just fine if you get this pool:  [...]    which I believe is the pool it was designed for.  I just put it on tonight and it covers just like the photo, it is not dark solid blue though, it is see through blue so I wonder if that will affect the algea or warmth of the water or anything.  I don't know how good it is to keep bugs out just yet because today is the first day of using it.  I have a skimmer though so I can skim those out, I mainly bought the cover to keep out leaves and bird droppings which I am hoping it does.  The material is thin but it's $9 so not like I had high expectations, the kiddie pool cost me less than $30 so didn't want to spend more than $10 on a cover for it. So far for the price I am happy with it.  I will update the review to let you know if it keeps stuff out of the pool.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game is great. A word of caution though, it's very addicting. However, this version doesn't look as good as it should. I'm disappointed in Popcap for using such low resolution graphics for the Android version.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I was flipping through the channels when I came across this, at first I was confused because Nick Jonas was on screen to what looked like a musical. We kept watching when I realized that it was Les Miserables. I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the performance of ALL the characters. I don't understand why people are being so harsh towards poor Nick Jonas. Yes, he might not have such a strong voice, but come on, he's only eighteen and he has plenty of room to grow in his voice, so sue him if he wants to break out of being a glorified pop star for Disney and branch out into something more substantial. It's not like he was out of tune, there were no parts where my ears started to bleed. He did a good job. I just think some people are snobby and don't want to see popular faces in such classic performances such as Les  Miserables. I believe that if people were just listening to the recording of the performance and not watching they would not be so harsh towards him. Overall I really enjoyed this production and it was a pleasant surprise for the evening.
B004RKXN44|5.0|If you are a fan of Nalini Singh then like me you've waited for Hawk and Sienna's story since you learned there was something between them. This story was both a joy and somewhat of a letdown. As another reviewer said, the book could have used a better editor 'cause the middle section was around 150 pages too long. By the time they finally got together i was over it. Hawks continued insistance that Sienna was too young and NOT his mate was fine the first 10-15 times but the 40th?! Hawk is a smart man the fact that he and everyone around him are so blindingly oblivious to the FACTS is but just one of the things that bring this book down for me. It's still one of the best series out there so i look forward to the next one, but this was not one of her best.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Wasn't sure about this product when I saw it on-line. Bought it anyways.Tried it as some as I recieved it. It did a great job on a pocket knife I treasured for years. I recommend this sharpener.
B004EC5IUW|4.0|I first saw this in the subbed version, and eagerly awaited the dubbed version.    Sadly, only about half the voice actors came back to do this release, and its not being produced by the same people who did the original dubbing for the series and all interations of it. It does take away from what I knew Eva to be... With Rei and Fuyutski and Gendo all being voiced by someone else... it threw me off. Even some parts from the series got reworded... One of the prime examples is the graveyard scene, where Gendo says \\"Burying memories is man's way of survival, but there are some things man should never forget.\\" It got reworded to something completely not as powerful or as structured, and Gendo comes off less powerful and more like an average person.    Since they've recreated the series and added a new character and tossed the story around a bit, there seems to be a total lack of character development, and the majority of the new voice actors dont have the same tone that made the dubbed version so good. The story, however, is amazing, and the effects are great. The direction Anno took with this is for sure different, and I cannot wait for the last two movies.     If you liked the old series, this is definately a rebuild. The first movie didnt show much of a change, but this movie does. If you want to get someone into Eva, this is not the way to do it. But its a great follow up after seeing the original, and this expands on the universe.

0143117564|4.0|Did you miss the whole '60's scene? The hippie, wanna-be-free feeling of beachfront California? Fear not. Readers can revisit this environment in Thomas Pynchon's book, Inherent Vice. Pynchon fans will recognize his style here; a rambling story that meanders from cultural icon to cultural icon, taking the reader along to whatever destination Pynchon has in mind, entertaining them along the way.<br /><br />Inherent Vice is the story of Doc Sportello, a private investigator who spends as little time working as he can get by on. He is visited by his ex-girlfriend, Shasta, who wants Doc to find her new boyfriend who seems to have disappeared. In the process of unraveling this mystery, Doc leads the reader through the discovery of the Internet, beach/surf music, a diabolical Eastern drug cartel, various right-wing thugs working for governmental or police agencies, Las Vegas before it was turned into Disneyland West, tons of marijuana smoking, lots of sex, and plenty of dubious characters. The whole chaotic journey devolves into a satisfactory conclusion where all the puzzles are solved and the good guys prevail.<br /><br />This book is recommended for all readers. Pynchon is an American treasure, one of the authors whose work will be read far into the future. His keen eye notes the details that make up a culture while his style entertains. Pynchon fans will be pleased with this book, and those who haven't yet discovered this author will be pleasantly surprised.

B00005NKKZ|3.0|I had a vinyl album and wanted to replace it with a CD.  This CD has stuff on it not on the original that I don't like, and some songs are not the same recording as the original and I don't like them either.  I assumed (I should remember what they say about doing that) that the CD was the same as my old album.  Ick.  However, the seller did a perfect job of filling my order; no complaints there!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Embarrassing, here's my play counts in iTunes for the entire album:  Sign No More: 99, The Cave: 122, Winter Winds: 23, Roll Away Your Stone: 31, White Blank Page: 30, I Gave You All: 14, Little Lion Man: 184, Timshel: 24, Thistle and Weeds: 10, Awake My Soul: 84, Dust Bowl Dance: 90. After the Storm: 116.  You'd think it will get a little stale after that many listens but I still find the whole Album excellent.    Some songs take a while to build, like Sigh No More or Dust Bowl Dance  - so put on a pair of headphones and lie down fully awake and immerse yourself in the lyrics.  Feel the tears of joy pour.  Just buying Little Lion Man / The Cave would be a horrible mistake.  I do hate the name, when I tell people about them I feel like I am talking about circus performers.

0393338827|5.0|I can't say this book is \\"the 2008 Crash Made Simple\\"- that would be impossible. And my own experience researching and explaining land, mining and oil well swindles with attendant political corruption in the American West was of far less help understanding the complex elements of the mortgage morass than I had hoped.    So I was relieved to see that the author used three key techniques (among others) to make the nearly indecipherable financial strategies and tactics behind the crash comprehensible. Lewis puts the reader in the room with players on both sides of complex transactions and uses clever metaphors to explain the levels of financial risk assumed by different classes of investors. Most helpfully of all, from time to time, he gently reminds the reader of key elements, such as the \\"towers of debt\\" behind thousands of mortgage transactions to sharpen the saw as the reader works  through this otherwise confusing, mind-numbing story.     Since these events were so recent, The Big Short leaves one fundamental question unanswered: how can it be that not a single notable player in this debacle was sent to jail? Historians many not fully answer that one for decades.
0142418471|1.0|I read the reviews on this and chose this book as a gift for my 13 year old daughter at Christmas. She is nearly 14 now and just started the book.  Within the first few pages there is very bad language and while I'm guilty of using this language (the F word) at times myself, my daughter hates it.  She (and we) found the book completely unacceptable and she won't be reading.  It was unfortunate that in the first few reviews that appear there was no mention of significant bad language.  She's heard the word before, and yes...many teens use this language...but actually, many do not and it isn't appropriate in young literature in my opinion.
0446691437|5.0|I loved this book because it gave me a tangible enemy. Resistance. Seems like common sense, but Pressfield puts it in such a way that I can fight procrastination confidently, more able to realize its shapeshifting forms. Like writing this review when I'm supposed to be writing something else... bye. Thanks Pressfield.
0156027321|5.0|After getting through a dry start (first 70 or so pages),  this turned into an engaging, beautifully detailed story.  Heart wrenching at times, and light hearted at others (surprisingly so, considering it takes place in the middle of an ocean in Pacific nowhere...) It is a story with an important message about being in the present moment.  An overall lesson on awareness and appreciating stillness.
0307593495|4.0|Since I am way older than Wallender is in this novel, supposedly Mankell's last with the detective, I found much of the moodiness and health worries believable but did sympathize with how Wallender dealt with them all--constantly brooding, imagining the worst, refusing to discipline himself consistently enough.  But his daughter Linda behaved pretty much as my own daughters do when they find how I carry on objectionable.  All in all, the way Wallander behaved made sense and was interesting, even if just too Scandinavian (bleak) for me.  My trouble was with Mankell's moral/political equivalence position about the Cold War.  He appears to fabricate some history to back it up, I believe, but for anyone like me who has lived under both major powers, USSR and USA, he is not believable and seems blinded by a sentimental welfare statist ideology.

Once the folders are set up, you can configure their appearance and sort then manually, or in a variety of automatic ways. You can also customize icons and create icons for special actions, such as dialing a phone number. This is one of my favorite apps--outstanding.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I am curious how the people that are disappointed with the end to this book would have had it end?  A happy ending with the hero as a benevolent queen and her circle of compatriots advising?  I really thought the end was very realistic on the whole considering all that had happened.  Really liked the series and I respect the ending that the author gave the trilogy.  All and all well worth the read!
B0052U59F4|5.0|This story is so complex and well done, I hate calling it erotica. There is so much more to it. There is drama, mystery, suspense, action, and humor. I am one of the multitude of fans that begged Icy to publish her work. It IS original. Her fanfic only used names and faces, and that has been changed for the publishing.<br />I wish the editing had been more thorough, like other reviewers. It is a pet peeve of mine. I cannot fault the author, however. The story is so good that it is easy to look past the errors.<br />I will be waiting anxiously for the next book.
0439023483|4.0|Hunger Games was an interesting read. There were some good points, and it did get an emotional reaction from me at certain points, but I felt that the author was focused to much on telling me things, rather than letting me experience them. Apart from Katniss, I had no interest in the other characters, although by the end I did like Peeta, mainly because there's such little dialogue. Katniss herself wasn't very likable. She became whiny and jumped to conclusions that were just to obviously wrong. She wasn't the strong female character that I thought she was supposed to be (according to reviews I'd read). She survives, but only because everyone else pretty much kills each other. Peeta was just too love stuck with Katniss, and I'm not sure why he's willing to die for this girl. Gale isn't even a main character as far as I'm concerned, kind of like Jacob in the Twilight. The idea of him as a love interest seemed forced at the end, and I just couldn't buy into it.<br /><br />The idea of the games is nothing new. I actually just watched Death Race and Death Race 2, and I'm pretty sure there are a few books with the same concept. I just wish that this had gone further.<br /><br />** I've edited my rating, as the longer I've thought on it, and after reading it through a second time it grew on me.

0307887960|4.0|If you are used to the American style of diet book that is long on stories, but short on detail, you'll be surprised by Dr. Dukan's book. While his diet is a variation of the many high protein diets out there, he doesn't tell you dozens of stories of people losing weight, but instead focuses on why the diet works.<br /><br />Although the diet sounds good, I do wish that one of the main parts of the diet, the Oat Bran, had specific recommendations for what to buy, instead of, basically, visit my website. But this is a minor quibble.<br /><br />About half the book is taken up with explaining the four phases of the diet and introducing it and his approach to weight loss. The remainder of the book is taken up with slight, and optional, refinements, talking about specific problems and with recipes.<br /><br />It's in the recipes where I see most clearly that he is French. As a Frenchman, he takes food more seriously than Americans do and the recipes reflect that. There are sauces, including some great vinegrettes, an emphasis on real ingredients, instead of fake diet food (a failing in many diet cookbooks), and on taste and texture. In fact, I saw many that should become regular parts of my collection, even when not dieting.<br /><br />But, even so, I still find there are things missing. First off, while he talks about weight loss during menopause, he does not discuss, even once, problems for post-menopausal women. He also places a great emphasis on walking. And, while walking is the easiest form of exercise I wish he would have acknowledged alternatives to eat.<br /><br />All in all, it's an excellent book.
B004RKXN44|4.0|I have a MAJOR complaint about Nalini Singh. She doesn't write fast enough & when I FINALLY get a book after waiting months - I devour it in 2 days!<br /><br />I always read the other reviews first before starting mine. I have to say I get where the 2 & 3 star reviewers are coming from. Saying that, I LOVED this story! I admit the sexual teasing was getting to me & at times seemed a little contrived. It was worth it though. I have to re-read the last few chapters. The battle scene was kind of chaotic. It seemed that Sienna killed her packmates & the feral wolves, but then she didn't? Can I get someone elses take?<br /><br />I read a review once that criticized Nalini for not letting any of the Dark River or Snow Dancers die, & at times it does seem unrealistic that everyone always makes it out alive & frisky. However, I'd be REALLY upset if they did die, so I guess I'm not very realistic either!<br /><br /> The story of Lara & Walker was sweet. I thought they would get their own short story, but wow! Great story line. Good revelations on Walker's character too.<br /><br /> Sascha & Luc finally have their baby - LOVE them!<br /><br /> Actually, I really enjoy seeing the characters from the previous stories. Nalini weaves them in well. I've always loved that about her stories. You can count on her adding an appropriate addition to her story with a character (or 20) you already know & love.<br /><br /> So, where to from here? Kaleb & his \\"mystery\\" swan? Will she be his redemption? How about the Ghost? Will he turn out to be a better person or totally cold? I had a weird thought about Nikita & Anthony, but somehow I don't think it'd work out. :)<br /><br /> Nalini  - WRITE QUICKER!!!!!

Way past their primes, Duke demonstrates his keyboard mastery,often overlooked by the critics who concentrate on his compositions and ability to maintain the greatest Big Band for over 50 years.  Louis is Satchmo, Pops, whatever you call him, simply the most outstanding individual performer in jazz history, the guy all soloists credit as an influence.  it doesn't get any better than this.

B004PV3M5A|1.0|This really sounds like a mish-mash of '80s alt pop like New Order, poppy Cure, and a dash of drone bands like JaMC, Loop, MBV, etc., mixed with '90s I'm-so-sedated vocals of bands like Lush, Lemonheads, Dinosaur Jr. and then some limp-wristed '90s alt pop like the La's or Toad the Wet Sprocket.<br /><br />There's been a lot of this retro stuff going around the last 5 years.  The problem is, it just doesn't seem to have any substance.  It strikes the pose but doesn't draw blood.  Stick with the originals.  This makes me feel like a bored, androgynous teenager from 1995, when the world outside my bedroom didn't exist.  Lame.

0553805371|5.0|This is a very interesting book that gives you a general overview of modern physics. It answers to a lot of questions regarding the creation of the world, and the roots of physics laws. It's not an advanced physics book with complicated math, it's a very easy to read book written for those without any eduction in physics.     I know some people were disappointed that Hawking doesn't give an absolute answer to a lot of questions. But you have to understand we are not there yet! If we knew everything that would have been the end of Physics, and a lot of other sciences... so don't expect to get all clear answers at the end!

The sync options works flawlessly (I have a PC and did NOT have to install/use Apple's Bonjour service to sync them wirelessly, contrary to at least one other review). Has all the features I need - customizable fields, search, intuitive UI on the desktop, wireless sync between desktop/handheld (I actually sync the desktop with two handhelds and it works great), encrypted backup on my PC.     Not sure what's up with the negative reviews. This is a great product.
B004SIP6N6|5.0|I was happy to see this finally hit blu-ray and for such a cheap price ($12.99 when I purchased it), I couldn't pass it up!<br />I don't need to gush about Kevin Smith or talk about how much I love Clerks or any of his other work. His work speaks for itself.<br />Having never purchased Clerks X, which I've wanted to do for so very long (for the funeral scene alone) I was happy to pick this up and see that added scene and much, much more. There are more special features than you can shake a stick at, including the F-bomb counter (way more than 37) or tidbits of facts that pop up as you re-watch this classic tale of jockeying a register.<br /><br />Buy it, watch it, add it to your collection. You will not be disappointed. I know I'm not.

B000001F6T|4.0|I was told by a very reliable friend to avoid Stonedhenge because, according to him, I'd only end up extremely disappointed with it.  Well... not really.  While it's true I find some portions of it lacking (especially concerning some of the guitar solos which definitely feel a tad underwhelming to me, with a few exceptions) I can't really find any serious complaints.  It's another decent album by Ten Years After.    If I try hard enough to find a few complaints, maybe *maybe* a lack of speed is a noticeable tiny flaw (and no, \\"Speed Kills\\" isn't *that* fast, contrary to one assuming it would be judging by the song title) but truthfully, I really don't care a whole lot about speed when the guitar work is good enough to get the job done.      Let's mention the high points- \\"Hear Me Calling\\" is a *fantastic* song.  I love the vocal melody (which reminds me of the one from the Grateful Dead's \\"Truckin\\" whether this is a coincidence or not) but the guitar work is truly astounding.  It's an example where every single note just clicks and feels right.       The song that goes by the name \\"No Title\\" is 8 minutes long, and perhaps in this case the vocal melody is a distraction because it never picks up- it just drags on quietly and predictably (and blandly).  Some of the guitar and keyboard work doesn't feel quite right either, like it was sloppily thrown together.  Still, when we consider Ten Years After are the masters of blues rock, it's melodic enough to qualify as decent.  Perhaps I'm being biased because I probably should find it more flawed than I currently am.    \\"Going to Try\\" might initially seem unappealing because of the relatively clumsy way the verse melody just speeds up all of a sudden, but keep listening because there's other segments of the song bound to tickle your fancy instead.  For instance, the dreamy, slow dance-like break in the middle which contains a gorgeous vocal melody, and the organ solo (or keyboard?) leaves me wanting more.  It reminds me ofsome of Deep Purple's early 70's work.      \\"A Sad Song\\" isn't really sad because it's based around a fairly basic blues pattern.  Perhaps the band was being ironic with the song title.  Either way, it's an okay song.  Nothing particularly interesting stands out about it though.  \\"Woman Trouble\\" is one of those sneaky-paced late night part-jazz, part-blues type songs.  I'll give it a pass since it's different from most of Ten Years After's discography, at least.  Actually on repeated listens, some of the guitar jamming feels pretty inspired and interesting, so it's a cool song after all.      No, I don't feel this is a weak effort.  Stonedhenge is probably not a classic like Ssssh is, though.  That's about the only negative I have with it.

0756405890|4.0|I only skimmed some of the reviews so it is likely that others have memtioned the connection as well, but I feel that Patrick Rothfuss has taken the same kernel of a story (boy is loved and happy, boy's parents are killed horrible by a dark master, boy goes to magic school, hijinx, emotional growth, love interests, etc.) that snowballed for J.K. Rowling and turned it into something brilliant with a realized potential Rowling could never hope to achieve.   Diana Wynne Jones told it in the sweetest and most humorous way, but Rothfuss's novel contains coming-of-age from an adolescent point of view and tempers it with the wisdom of adult retrospection. He has a knack for description and emotional nuance that brings his settings and characters to life. While many fantasy novels are schmaltzy and filled to the brim with stilted language and cheezy Ren-Fair dialogue, this book is deep and keeps you involved. I have missed my stop on the train at least twice because of it.  It will capture your imagination and leave you wanting more.  Thank you.
1591844096|2.0|I follow Seth's blog and have heard a great deal about his books. He's a pretty renown figure in the marketing world, after all.<br /><br />Although I hadn't read any of his books myself, when a friend expressed interest in this area, I immediately bought this book for her after briefly scanning the great reviews. Knew it had to be good.<br /><br />So when I decided to flip through it and read it myself before giving it away, I was surprised to find how repetitive and fluffy it was. Perhaps for those who have never considered being more than a cog in the workplace might find Linchpin enlightening, but I read a lot of entrepreneurial/lifestyle design blogs that go into the topic much more thoroughly (for free too), so I guess I had already heard everything the book had to say.<br /><br />The book in a nutshell: We've been taught to obey the rules, follow orders, do what the boss says. Not the way to succeed anymore - you have to be creative, overcome your fear/resistance for taking an untraditional path.<br /><br />I recommend Tina Seelig's \\"[[ASIN:0061735191 What I Wish I Knew When I Was 20: A Crash Course on Making Your Place in the World]]\\" for something with more substance.<br /><br />Sorry, Seth :( I'll still check out your other books, but perhaps with more caution now.

1594744769|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs is a very inventive novel. Part coming of age, part murder mystery, and part monster story with a touch of time travel and love, it is very unique and provides a showcase for this interesting author.<br /><br />In this story we meet Jacob who has grown up listening to his grandfather's fantastical tales of his youth. Jacob heard his grandfather speak of leaving his family as a boy and going off alone to a small island where he went to live with strange children in a large house and not without a bit of danger. In his old age, however, Jacob and his family believe the old fellow to be a bit on the crazy side and never really trust his tales of the danger that lurks in the shadows, that is, until something bad happens to him out of the blue. Jacob is left to find clues regarding his Grandfather's past and with a little rousting of his orinthologist father, they go to the island where Jacob presumes his grandfather had grown up and left his secrets long ago when he may have escaped a very special orphanage.<br /><br />Black and white photos help tell the story and add a bit more substance to the story as we can actually see the strange characters in the book. They are peculiar indeed. When Jacob finds the orphanage that his Grandfather grew up in things get stranger and stranger when he learns the truth about the children from the pictures and their caretaker, Miss Peregrine.<br /><br />Twists and turns abound in this book and by the ending you'll find yourself enthralled by what Jacob has discovered. I enjoyed this book with the odd photos. The story was fresh and original and like I said, it's full of twists and turns. Jacob starts out as a kind of unlikeable boy but as the book continues he becomes an odd hero who has to make some peculiar choices as his Grandfather did before him.
B004IQMXD4|4.0|After a ten-year hiatus,  Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks releases her latest effort, [[ASIN:B004IQMXD4 In Your Dreams]].  Coming alongside her ten-year hiatus, Nicks stacks on ten years in age (she's now 63). Despite this, vocally, Nicks remains a viable, worthwhile vocalist, retaining the timbre of voice that made her so captivating in her heyday.  In Your Dreams is a fine return effort, sounding much different from many of the albums gracing the Billboard 200 Album Charts these days.  And face, a number six bow for a sixty-three year old vet ain't to shabby!<br /><br />\\"Secret Love,\\" one of the album's highlights, opens up the effort superbly.  The production and style is distinctly in a soft-rock vibe, which suits Nicks's pipes.  The chorus is both  memorable and effective: \\"But you need some rest, my darlin', it's best/But we already passed it, I cried/Oooh wee, listen to me, Must secret loves secretly die.\\"  \\"For What It's Worth,\\" another solid cut features a nice mysterious, almost ominous opening about it that transitions into a rhythmic groove.  The production is solid, and the harmonized background vocals that materialize on the second iteration of the chorus are superb.  Again, the chorus shapes the selection: \\"You said, even if I/left my girlfriend/packed up my stuff/loaded up my car/drove down to your house/with good intentions/came thru your door/for what it's worth...\\"<br /><br />\\"In Your Dreams\\" begins a bit off-putting, but once the listeners keys in, it is another worthwhile listen.  The organ is a nice touch within the production.  \\"Wide Sargasso Sea\\" finds a nice low-key vibe about the chorus initially, before the track erupts and evolves grandly.  The folksy-rock edge is superb for this cut and for Nicks.  The timbre throughout is perfect.  \\"New Orleans\\" finds Nicks slowing the tempo, contrasting \\"Wide Sargasso Seas\\" ferociousness.  The synthesized pad (organ) and acoustic guitars are beautiful when coupled together.  \\"Moonlight (A Vampire's Dream)\\" maybe the most inspired cut since the fine \\"For What It's Worth,\\" opening with acoustic piano ostinato that eventually evolves into a more driving, overt rock and roll cut.  The songwriting is impeccable, aiding in this track's `hit' status.<br /><br />\\"Annabel Lee,\\"  an adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe's famed poem is enjoyable with a nice straight-ahead rock feel.  The quibble? It is a bit too long and too drawn out.  \\"Soldier's Angel,\\" another lengthy cut is more well rounded than \\"Annabel Lee.\\"  The track, much like many of the others, evolves over time and turns into yet another Nicks gem.  \\"Everybody Loves You\\" is solid, and does feature some slight changes of pace given the use of some synths.  The production returns back to earth (or rock, whichever comes first) when guitars layer atop the synthetic texture.  The cut turns out to be pleasant, but not revolutionary.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Are Gone\\" opens with solid, bluesy guitars.  \\"You May Be The One,\\" more notable than its predecessor, features a great six-feel as well as smart use of piano, guitar, and organ.  The vocal production is excellent as is the smart use of background vocals to support Nicks's distinct lead vocals.  Penultimate cut \\"Italian Summer\\" makes beautiful use of strings and harmonic progression, while closer \\"Cheaper than Free,\\" featuring producer Dave Stewart, features grand chemistry between the pair vocally.  The pedal steel and electric guitar give this cut a beautiful country-rock feel.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004IQMXD4 In Your Dreams]] is a superb album.

B004K4AUZW|4.0|Lady Gaga has become a household name by all means.  When her debut effort [[ASIN:B001GM28HO The Fame]] materialized in 2008, no one knew who Lady Gaga was.  After The Fame launched mega hits including \\"Just Dance,\\" \\"Poker Face,\\" \\"Love Game,\\" and \\"Paparazzi,\\" Lady Gaga became something of a more daring, bold Madonna.  \\"Bad Romance\\" cemented the iconic status, finding Lady Gaga to be something of a spokesperson for the `everyman' who may normally be viewed as `weird' or a `loser.' Gaga's second full length album [[ASIN:B004K4AUZW Born This Way (Special Edition)]] (excluding the Grammy-award winning EP [[ASIN:B002W6Z0UK The Fame Monster]] which is arguably just an expansion of her first effort) continues Gaga's ascent into pop culture stardom (She's definitely a queen).  An album that is as vivacious and ambitious as her first,  Born This Way is a fine follow-up filled with a fine mixture of dance cuts as well as a couple pop and singer-songwriter driven numbers.  And face it, who would have ever thought a dance album would have blown through 1.1 million copies its first week? Born This Way worth the hype? I think so.<br /><br />\\"Marry The Night\\" starts of the album strongly with a grand opening by the dance-pop chanteuse while the verses carry an 80's sensibility that highlights Gaga's vocals.  The refrain is cutting edge, finding Gaga belting: \\"I'm gonna marry the night/I'm not gonna cry anymore/I'm gonna marry the night/leave nothin' on these streets to explore...\\"  \\"Born This Way,\\" The #1 promo single loses no momentum,  if for nothing more than Gaga's spoken word intro: \\"It doesn't matter if you love him, or capital H-I-M/just put your paws up/`cause you were born this way baby...\\" The songwriting is clever and tasteful, despite its liberated tone and the best line just might be \\"don't be a drag, just be a queen...\\", which is chanted constantly throughout the number.  \\"Government Hooker\\" doesn't miss a beat, thanks to solid production work from Gaga, DJ White Shadow, Fernando Garibay, and DJ Snake.  The conceptual nature of \\"Government Hooker\\" (well, for lack of better phrasing) sells it.<br /><br />\\"Judas,\\" one of Gaga's many biblical references throughout the effort, is as solid all else, notably for its driven production work and catchy hook: \\"I'm just a holy fool/oh baby it's so cruel but/I'm still in love with Judas...\\"  \\"Americano\\" changes pace with multicultural (Spanish) influenced production, much like one might hear on say a Gogol Bordello album.  The use of a mariachi band is certainly off-beat and clever.  \\"Hair,\\" one of several valedictory moments, clearly is a show stopper with inherent Madonna's influence.  The quality of the cut is more of pop-urban sound and the incorporation of saxophone cements it's neo-80's sound.  The hook is to die-for (Madonna would've killed for this cut): \\"I've had enough, this is my prayer, that I'll die living just as free as my hair...\\" German-gibberish cut \\"Schei&szlig;e\\" is another moment of brilliance, if for nothing more than another ridiculous, than catchy spoken word introduction:  \\"I don't speak German, but I can if you like...\\"  The hook also sells this cut: \\"I wish that I could dance on a single prayer/I wish I could be stronger without somebody there...\\"<br /><br />\\"Bloody Mary\\" changes paces, smart considering the driving, dance-feel of both \\"Hair\\" and \\"Schei&szlig;e.\\"  \\"Black Jesus  Amen Fashion\\" is one of several bonus cuts on the Special Edition which is enjoyable, but not necessarily a standout.  \\"Bad Kids,\\" featured on all editions,  is solid, again finding Gaga honing in on her songwriting talents.  \\"Fashion of HIs Love,\\" another Madonna-esque cut is just as effective, with \\"Vogue\\" written all over it: \\"Oh I'm seeing all the signs from above, I'm gonna be the one that he loves, I was made for loving him, the fashion of his love...\\" Vocally, \\"Fashion\\" is one of Gaga's most enthused vocal performances.<br /><br />\\"Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)\\" lays well, particularly given the use of organ.  \\"Heavy Metal Lover\\" is a B+ cut, but enjoyable.  \\"Electric Chapel\\"  and \\"The Queen\\" (\\"The Queen\\" only appears on the special edition) are OK, but not the best.  \\"Yo&uuml; and I\\" restores accelerating momentum with superb songwriting by Gaga and exceptional vocals.  \\"The Edge of Glory\\" closes the album (the standard edition that is) with pep and a memorable, inspiring refrain.  The Special Edition features five remixes:  \\"Born This Way Country Road Version,\\" \\"Judas DJ White Shadow Remix,\\" \\"Marry the Night Zedd Remix,\\" \\"Shei&szlig;e DJ White Shadow Mugler,\\" and \\"Fashion of his Love Fernando Garibay Remix.\\"<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004K4AUZW Born This Way (Special Edition)]] is as interesting as The Fame was.

B003L20IFQ|1.0|This was compared to Hitchcock by more than a few people at the time of its release. Alfred Hitchcock. Master of suspense.     Ryan Reynolds is in a box. That's the whole movie. In fact, it's technically a spoiler, I suppose. He's in a box and he's Ryan Reynolds (which is to say, he effectively plays himself). What about that qualifies as psychological thriller, exactly? Is there anything about Ryan Reynolds' psychology that you didn't pick up fifteen years ago by watching half an episode of \\"Two Guys, a Girl, and a Pizza Place\\"? Was there anything about that experience that made you feel that watching him lay in a box for 90 minutes would be \\"thrilling\\"? If not, then you will not find this to be a psychological thriller.    Don't worry, there's a subplot. It's a scathing critique of the failures of automated telephone systems. I swear to God... that's the subplot.     Oh, and there's a theme, too. Something about corruption of modern government and corporate interests blah, blah, blah. I guess some people like movies that carry a big political message for no apparent reason. Some people like \\"Lone Wolf McQuade\\". Some people have bad taste.    And it's those people, the ones who have bad taste, who are the target with the title of my review. I take no issue with Rodrigo Cortes, the director of this dud. I believe in free art and welcome anyone who wants to make a movie, irrespective of what quality of film they make.    Critics, however, which is to say anyone who offered an opinion on this bad boy, should generally just feel ashamed of themselves. Comparisons got made to Hitchcock, and those people are out of their mind. And anyone who heard those comparisons and didn't make sure to redact them are accomplices to insanity. This isn't similar to Alfred Hitchcock. At all. Hitchcock was first and foremost a master of cinematography. This movie takes place in a damn box. There isn't any cinematography. Hitchcock was also a crafter of wild characters, men so outside ofour narrow archetypal view of characters that the juxtaposition of the two often taught us something about human behavior. What does Ryan Reynolds teach us, exactly? Don't date Alanis Morisette? I already knew that.     My point is just that making such a weak comparison is bad criticism. Critics, good critics, can act as guardians of history in a way. They help us as a culture retain a high standard for greatness, because they appreciate what was great in that which was, and take time to understand why it was great. Without this, culture would be forced to reset every five years. If all you can remember about Hitchcock films are that they were sort of creepy and often based on semi-universal human fears (the only two analogies that can be drawn between \\"Buried\\" and anything Hitchcock ever did) then go watch them again. It would CERTAINLY be much better time spent than any time pumped into \\"Buried\\".
B001K3ENEA|4.0|I have the higher end k240's which are noticeably crisper and better sounding than these. But for the price, these are not a bad headphone...maybe for a client to use or for the VO booth. Not for main mixing but definitely a good secondary set. Also for me akg headphones are the most comfortable for extended wearing times. These k44's are pretty comfortable. I also have a really nice set of Sony's but I can never wear them very long before they get extremely uncomfortable.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|I had an open mind with no expectations going into the movie.  The first few sequences were very good, but then it fell into a repetive trap and I thought it was a mistake.  But then \\"I got it\\" once one of the superwomen died.  After that, it all started to make (some) sense and I loved it.     Great to see that the modern graphic novel adaption doesn't try to water it down for the masses.   The \\"dispatcher/bus driver\\" is still a bit confusing but I'm waiting to buy it so I can fill in that piece of the puzzle. ;)
0061766089|5.0|Whether we like it or not, today's business leaders find themselves in a completely different world with a completely different set of rules. They are rapidly discovering that a 19th-century management model is ill equipped to handle the complex challenges of a 21st-century post-digital world.  Tim Brown's Change By Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation is a timely guide for business leaders who are ready to accept that managing at today's speed of change is only possible if they change how they manage.<br /><br />For the past hundred years, management practices have been shaped and guided by the tenets of analytical thinking.  In this context, the fundamental work of management has been defined as problem solving and the pursuit of the \\"one best way.\\" Accordingly, managers have been \\"taught to take a series of inputs, analyze them, and then converge upon a single answer.\\" This brand of convergent thinking has reinforced the notion that organizational intelligence is essentially a function of individual smarts, which explains why traditional management reveres the heroic leader, the star performer, and the lone genius.<br /><br />However, Brown points out an overdependence on convergent thinking could be hazardous, if not fatal, in today's fast changing times. That's because convergent thinking is not good at discerning the future or exploring new possibilities. When the pace of change is accelerating, the business leader's central challenge is to create the future when the past is no longer an indicator of what tomorrow will bring. According to Brown, meeting this central challenge requires complementing convergent thinking with divergent thinking.  Divergent thinking is the capacity to identify options and hold multiple, sometimes paradoxical, ideas in tension to produce breakthrough solutions. Brown refers to this integration of the divergent and the convergent as \\"design thinking.\\"<br /><br />Design thinking is an iterative dance between the nonlinear and the linear, between exploring options and narrowing choices, and between making discoveries and making decisions. Accordingly, design thinking recognizes that our best intelligence comes from the blending of analysis and synthesis, and that each of these processes are equally important. This means that business leaders have to get comfortable with the messiness of the creative process, and they have to learn embrace the chaos that usually precedes the unexpected discovery. In fast changing times, it is the unexpected discovery that often reshapes a market.<br /><br />Brown correctly counsels leaders that reaping the benefits of design thinking will require a shift from the hierarchical cultures that dominate most of our businesses. Both fast changing times and design thinking call for organizations that are built for speed, innovation, and collaboration. Hierarchies are not designed to support any of these needs because they are inherently slow, incremental, and compartmentalized. However, Brown advises that those leaders who successfully make the transition to a design thinking culture \\"are likely to become more deeply engaged, more highly motivated, and more wildly productive than they have ever been before.\\"<br /><br />When business leaders adopt the disciplines of design thinking, their day-to-day business processes create space for everyone's voice because they come to understand that nobody is smarter than everybody. They recognize that the key to unlocking extraordinary performance is the capacity to leverage their collective knowledge through the iteration of synthesis and analysis, the integration of the divergent and convergent, and the blending of bottom-up exploration and wise guidance from above.<br /><br />If business leaders want to be fully prepared to manage at the pace of change and are ready to redesign their management architecture for speed, innovation, and collaboration, Brown's book is an excellent place to start.
B0051QIGP4|2.0|Madonna redux but with less interesting music.  I downloaded this for 99 cents and well, that's about how much it's worth in my music rotation.  Gaga uses the term disenfranchised a lot.  Right.  She is a franchise.  She needs to enjoy it and capitalize on it as best she can.  If she continues this derivative, mediocre club music for the masses sound, she will fizzle a bit faster than Madonna and Brittany did.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|This is a story which tells us that even when one has been deceived and wounded to the core, one still has the option to react and behave with kindness, understanding and empathy. A rare and raw look at some remarkably wise and talented people. Beautifully constructed and compelling in every way. Sit back and drink up the truth.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This is one of those movies that is not for everyone. It is really guttural base plot line. The music plays a constant role in setting mood and is louder than in many story based movies. The special effects and camera shoots are spectacular and if nothing more are worth seeing the movie for them alone. There is a necessity on the veiwers part to stop veiwing it as a movie and start thinking of it as more of chaotic dark dream. So if you are unimaginative, not a fan of blending cgi into reality or just do not like dark movies, this is not a film for you. I personally loved it. I think it is the future of film (at least part of the future) the special effects come effortlessly and look realistic. This is quite simply put a movie that would have been impossible to make 20 years ago. Even if someone one could have wrote the screenplay. Also I really enjoyed the writing (both in dialogue and plot progression) I will be fair and admit there are moments that felt slightly rushed and there was a time or two the writing did not hold its own. Over all though this is easily the best movie of the year I have seen. Probably the best \\"new\\" movie I have seen in a couple years. (yes I did like it more than Avatar, which has been the first question asked when I have made my previous statement) As I have said though, THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. Still, I would recommend it for anyone that loves special effects, use of music in non-musical movies, loves dark plot lines, strong female leads or just a general mind trip. So if you have liked what you heard, I would say check it out. Take care.

B0019HYTEQ|5.0|I love this album!  It'll stay in the CD player for days at a time.  There's something about his voice that soothes me--and the tone of it now that he's older is even more so.  I'd be hard-pressed to name a favorite from this album because all the songs are fantastic!  If you are a fan of Bryan Adams, this is a MUST.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I picked this up because as a writer, I just want to know what makes those \\"hits.\\" Even though it's a teen book, this thing will appeal to adults just as easily. I'm a 46 year old man and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The concept was very fascinating and the action satisfying. She creates a world that will transfer very well to the movie screen. I gave the book to my daughter and she devoured it. Congrats to Mrs. Collins on creating a crossover book that doesn't involve vampires! Book two seemed to be too much of a re-do of book one. But book three is a good finale to the story. Once you read this, you'll be hooked to go the rest of the way.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|The Troll Hunter or Trolljegeren is a Norwegian monster movie portrayed as if it is real recovered footage of a man who hunts trolls and the student journalists who follow him.  It is written and directed by Andr&eacute; Øvredal, a name to keep an eye on for sure.  Here is a film that works with a modest budget and takes an absolutely absurd concept and somehow forces it through as realistic a lens as possible.  Sure, it's easy now to just brush off these mokumentary movies as gimmicks, because there have been quite a few of them from [[ASIN:B00006FMCS Man Bites Dog]] to [[ASIN:B003Y5H59M The Blair Witch Project]] and to the more recent [[ASIN:B001MVYUR0 Quarantine]] (or the superior movie [[ASIN:B0028DRGDQ [Rec]]] that it was based on).  There have been misses of course with this method but more often than not its use has been effective in making a scenario seem more authentic and the horror of it all the more compelling and enjoyable.  I'm past believing the mokumentary set-up is hackneyed now.  It seems to me a very legitimate way of making movies seem more real, especially in an age where computerized images dominate big budget Hollywood pictures and unwittingly request that real cinephiles stretch our suspension of disbelief well beyond at least my own comfort zone.  So I'm a proponent of the possibilities of the mokumentary horror film after watching this little gem that contains all the elements to make every frame fun and believable.  It is particularly highlighted by Otto Jespersen's Hans; the film's title role.  His dead pan demeanor and casual actions in bizarrely twisted situations bring a welcome dry humor that had me chuckling regularly as I enjoyed The Troll Hunter.  Jespersen offers up a Bill Murray-like performance in a role that is clearly not written for a comedian, but is most definitely and quite potently delivered by one.  He is terrific in this movie.<br /><br />A group of naive student journalists sets out to track down and document a supposed bear poacher.  This is Hans (Jespersen) and he is very reluctant to respond to their inquiries about his activities.  They follow Hans all over Western Norway until they finally discover what he is really doing.  After they figure this out he lets them follow and film him as he goes about his unique occupation.  The moment when the students know for sure what Hans is really up to will test your imagination or make you laugh hysterically, or maybe even a little bit of both.  At that moment I wasn't really sure what I was watching but I knew one thing; I loved it.<br /><br />The natural performances by the rest of the cast are not to be overlooked.  These are talented young actors that help make the film much more than a simple one trick monster movie.  The Troll Hunter should also be commended for being shot on location in the mountains of Western Norway.  It couldn't have been an easy shoot for anyone but again it lends itself in an attempt to make an off-the-wall concept filmmable and compelling.  I suspect massive international attention for The Troll Hunter soon enough, and it deserves it.  This has cult classic written all over it.er.

1594202842|3.0|So, I finally picked up and finished this book after hearing and reading about it.  It was of particular interest to me because I am caucasian and married to an Asian man and we are trying to raise two beautiful children with the best traditions of both cultures. We will most likely parent a bit differently than Ms. Chua.    The 478 reviews already posted have it right:  Chua's book does compare western and eastern parenting philosophies and yes, you will either understand or condemn Chua's position.  There is little room for a middle ground.       I wonder, though, after reading the book and getting past all the media hype, if this book isn't really an attempt on Chua's part to \\"process\\"/ reflect on her own parental mismanagement.  For all its bravado regarding the Chinese parenting philosophy, this book has a subtle tone of regret.    I am not so sure that a published book is really the appropriate venue for one to \\"work through\\"/ confess a very personal matter like parenting successes and failures ... perhaps an indication that the Yale professor is smart (she'll make a lot of money with a controversial/sensationalist book like this), but not wise (a private apology with admission of regret and shortcoming might go a lot further with Lulu than a public one).
0440419514|4.0|Still busy and still enjoying it. have to admit my main reason for reading it is to try and find out (for myself) why christians criticize this book so much.<br /><br />Its a great fantasy, and i really think its only controlling parents that need to be concerned. Or in cases where you think the reader cant differentiate between fiction and reality, as in too young a reader, and only in households where the parents want to enforce the \\"there is only one true faith and its the christian faith\\" ideal, or where you dont trust your kids to be able to make up their own minds. My reason's for this is that the book is very close to home, but with a twist. Not like a completely otherworldly fantasy that is \\"obviously\\" fiction. I suppose it cant plant ideas and doubts in maybe a tiny percentage of youngsters , the kinds of ideas and doubts very conservative christian parents would dislike. I'd recommend that those parents read the books themselves first and make an informed decision about what age a child/youngster should be before they read it.<br /><br />For all the open minded people out there - enjoy!!!!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The following paragraph(s) is full of spoilers. So do not read if you have not read the book.       War is hell.     This stunning conclusion of Ms. Collins is written so well that it describes the terrors of war and suffering. Never have I read a book that truly describes in detail of war. The suffering Katniss goes through is completely unnerving because you can feel those emotions coursing through you. The realization that the human race is not perfect. Its worked upon. Its acceptable. How Katniss chooses at the last minute to assassinate Coin was unexpected. Seriously! But, reading along i felt that it was a just decision. The reason rebelling started was because of the Hunger Games and the after effects it caused. Katniss struggles through it all. Barely holding herself together. She manages though losing all of the people that matter to her.     Being pushed around and manipulated to perform and act is a part of revolution. You saw it just a couple months ago during Egypt's crisis. Murdered individuals became Martyr's with their faces on posters. They became the symbol of revenge, unity, strength, and the need to change. Three words come to mind when i have typed this, its \\"Sacrifice is needed.\\" Katniss battles each and every person to object to this. But, during this book. She never realizes it. I think when she takes place in her first Hunger Games is what really starts to weigh her down. Her will is tested. Her beliefs challenged. She has seen people, not many of them pure adults, slaughtered all for the fun of it. That's what really eats at her when she tries to protect her loved ones. She would rather sacrifice herself than watch other innocent people be killed. Her part in the Hunger Games creates this character that was born in district 12 and raised on harsh opinions of the Capitol. Then volunteering for Prim and taking part in the Hunger Games which ultimately started tearing at her. Then finally the decision of taking part as the Mockingjay which intruth broke her.     The war and suffering is a solid truth of our every day lives. Now days we have little concern for others and their safety. I believe this book teaches us that when we feel as if something is not right. We do something about it. But their are times when our change is not better. But worse. So we change it again and make it to where we can make it acceptable and perfect it along the way.

B002OB9KPE|2.0|When I had the first Transatlantic album I was in awe, the music was fantastic and lyrics charged, meshing to an overall sound-scape that was brilliant and satisfying as a long time progressive rock fan.  The second album didn't disappoint me either - met again with high energy, complex rhythms, and a composition that dared you to try to follow each musical phrase as it was interwoven with the next.    However, the third album is a let down.  Musically it repeats the styling of the former two, and stays within its well established comfort zone.. becoming in turn somewhat less progressive in and of itself. What's worse is that lyrically it falls flat on its face.  The songs are often trite and burdened with saccharine spiritual cliché's that should move this album from progressive rock to Christian rock.  Neil Morse has, singularly, ruined this band with his over-the-top God Praise laden lyrics.     I'm not against spirituality, to each their own, but when the broader message of any spiritual path becomes so \\"preachy\\" and faith worshiping as this does, it risks alienating anyone that isn't the most devout.  The one thing I had always enjoyed about progressive rock was its accessibility, its \\"worldliness\\" that would not allow itself to be defined by a singular faith or culture.    This one, however, not only over indulgences in a self-satisfying and smug ego driven spirituality that it forgets to acknowledge much else..  and as a result is a complete fail.
B0040JHWKS|1.0|Since Bruce signed a 7 album $110 million deal with Sony in 2005, he has just been mailing it in to fulfill the terms of the contract.  Not only does Bruce's contract allow Sony to recoup payment from sales of new material, it allows Sony to recoup its investment from sales of older material giving Sony and Bruce an incentive to both repackage old material and release rather mediocre new material, of which this is an excellent example!  Yes, I'll continue to buy Bruce's music but my admiration for him as a principled artist has been greatly diminished.  If you want a great album of previously released material that bears little resemblance to what originally came out on various albums, buy Warren Zevon's wonderful \\"Preludes\\" which was released after his untimely death.

This is how it has been for much of the 20th century.<br />The alternative idea is shaking up the industry, doing something completely different, evolving or revolutionizing a business in some way.  Adapting to the new needs of customers, having a deep understanding of the core of your business, and continually building a culture of bettering ones' own efforts in strategy and execution.  Ideas like these seem to be surfacing in many successful business models recently as a part of the strategy, slowly approaching the point where there is no competition, welcome to the blue ocean.<br /><br />Definitely worth a purchase.

0425241505|3.0|Pia Giovanni has a special talent.  It is one that she shared with her loser (now) ex-boyfriend in a moment of weakness that he chose to exploit.  Because of it she is blackmailed into stealing something from a very powerful being.    That theft sets off a chain of events that brings Pia to the attention of a lot of other-worldly beings, much to her dismay.  Being a halfling (half human, half wyr) is a dicey proposition in Pia's world.  All of her life her mother had impressed upon her the absolute necessity of keeping her head down, making no attachments, and learning how to pick up and run at the drop of a hat.  Pia had forgotten all of this until it was too late.    Dragos is a Dragon Wyr.  When Pia steals from his hoarde, his anger is felt all over Manhattan.  But when he finally finds her, instead of killing her he instead decides to keep her for himself.    I was very excited to read this because it had gotten a couple write-ups in review blogs that made it sound like it had a very new, fresh take on PNR.  I tend to get a little weary of the sub-genre because it feels sometimes like it is just very...done.  A few authors have created such complete, immersive worlds that they are still my go-tos (Nalini Singh,Ilona Andrews,Patricia Briggs).  But by and large I tend to shy away from new entries into the field unless they are bringing something new to the table.    That didn't happen here.  Don't get me wrong...this was a fun and quick read with lots of snappy dialogue and witty characters.  but in the end of the day there really wasn't much that felt new.     Dragos is the head of the Wyr -- which is basically another way of saying shapeshifters.  He has created a corporation that on one level works as a multi-national business  that employs the various Wyrfolk and builds his immense wealth and on another level works as a feudal system where he is the undisputed king and the rest of the wyrfolk tend to be his minions.  It is also a collective because they are inopposition to the Dark Fae and the Elves.    So there is some world building there that sets the scene, but again it didn't wow we over with something that felt really different.    What was really cool was the type of shifter that Pia was.  I thought that was great and explained a lot why her mother had drummed all the stuff into Pia's head. All the mythology surrounding Pia herself was well done.    Dragos, otoh, was a run of the mill Alpha Dragon male shifter who meets the One Woman who matters after millenia of living and not having anyone to love.  All the aggression with mating, possessiveness, protectiveness etc. etc. is all there.  Again not a bad thing, but fairly typical.    Normally this might have even been a 4-star read for me because like I said it was fun and I do like PNR that falls on the lighter side of things because so many are so angsty.  But there were a few things that bugged.    Firstly, I tend to dislike the idea of a long lived creature like Dragos having lived milennia and having had not a single meaningful relationship with a female until Pia.  Especially since it seems he's absolute magic in the sack! I know it is fantasy and it is romance but that always seems implausible to me.    Secondly, I just had to roll my eyes with how quickly and easily she was accepted as part of his inner sanctum.  He has these guards called Sentinels who watch his back and have been with him for centuries.  They are stone cold bad-asses!  Within, like, 3 days, Pia has won them over completely.  They thawed out when she rejected Dragos' Black American Express card.  See?  She's good people!  Not a gold-digger.  She must be ok!  I could sort of accept it because like I said the story is on the lighter side, but it just yanks a few of my 'gimme a break' chains.    Thirdly, Pia has a stupid heroine moment which I saw a coming from a mile away because she had to do something to get her kidnapped by the bad guy.  The minute the scene started  I knew exactly whereit was gonna go.  And it did.    and Finally, the main villain was kinda lame.  Ok very lame. In the end it pretty anti-climactic.    So yeah, not a 5-star read for me.  Not even close.  But still fun enough hat I will most likely read any follow up books.
B004UBM4TA|4.0|Like the Last Airbender, this Blu Ray 3D disc is, at least initially, an exclusive of another large electronics retailer. As with many Blu Ray 3D discs, the package includes a 3D BD, 2D BD, DVD and digital copy. (All of this could be provided on a 2-sided, single disc, with 3D/2D BD on one side and DVD/digital copy on the other, but that is obviously not as fiscally advantageous to the distributor.)<br /><br />The 3D images in space were shot using an IMAX 3D film camera to document the final repairs to the Hubble Space Telescope in particular, but also the NASA Space Shuttle program in general, which will come to an end in July, 2011, for future generations. No future Hubble repairs will be possible as our ability to do heavy lifting for space delivery will end with the last shuttle unless private space companies rise to fill the gap. As such this 3D Blu Ray disc gets the job done well in 40 minutes. There are also many additional 2D segments which are all worth watching.<br /><br />The 3D image is spectacular, as might be expected from IMAX. The camera is in a static position on the shuttle with the astronauts moving around in front of it for a given sequence. Presumably the camera was too big to hand hold. There are no trick shots, just documentary-type 3D, and it is very nice.<br /><br />Of additional interest are the 3D images created from Hubble 2D images of distant, distant galaxies -- the thing Hubble was created to do. So the observer gets to \\"fly\\" through the cloud-like cosmic cradles where stars are born. This part of the disc was, to me, jaw-droppingly unexpected, and a very real reason to buy this 3D BD.<br /><br />I dropped one star from the rating because of the number of 2D extras on the disc. 3D digital cameras are now small enough that many extras could have been shot in 3D. The quality would not have matched the IMAX 3D image, but would have made the cost of this short 3D Blu Ray disc more justifiable.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been playing for a little over a year on my iPad 1 and more recently iPad 2 and beat the game several times.  I was eagerly awaiting the Android port because I'd rather play on my phone while on the go than lug a tablet.<br /><br />Overall, its not bad.  Not awesome because there are a few quirks (slow loads, down scaled graphics, etc.) but some of that is probably because of the platform.  iOS doesn't have umpteen different resolutions, processors to contend with and stuff stored on an SD card won't load as quickly or smoothly as they do from solid state RAM.<br /><br />People have said this was rushed, I beg to differ.  Pop Cap has had quite a while to port this over to Android.  Could that have done a better job?  Maybe.  In spite of the aforementioned, the game is very playable and a lot of fun.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Get the game; even with the minor issues, it is worth every penny.
0596805527|5.0|It's not step-by-step manual for learning Javascript but it is definitely the most comprehensive and complete book on Javascript you will ever find. Everything you need to know about the language is there and with a good amount of examples too. How can you be without it? It is a given that an intermediate, and advanced user would benefit from this book, but I would dare say that even a beginner would greatly benefit. If your new to Javascript, or never programmed before then I would suggest the learning series for javascript, or the Head First series(for visual learners), to get you started (I chose the Head First series). But soon enough, you will quickly find as you hunger for more, you will need this book as well. Especially when you are learning a new language, you need to have a good reference on hand so you can practice and experiment beyond that of the simple examples. It helps you comprehend and better understand what going on. It also helps you to see all that is possible with the language. Simply put, this book is a necessity to mastering the Javascript language.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This is my favorite of the books-to-movie adaptations.  It might have been her quietest work, but it is so powerful!  The idea of love lasting through a long time apart after a difficult split is timeless.    Wonderful actors bring the characters to life and the screenwriter stuck closely to the novel.
B000TETD9Q|5.0|The Very Best of The Beach Boys: Sounds of Summer gives us an incredible 30 tracks spanning literally decades of the awesome career of The Beach Boys. Any of these 30 tracks would be perfect for the casual fan or for people just discovering the magical artistry of The Beach Boys.<br /><br />The track set begins with \\"California Girls.\\" They harmonize to perfection and the guitars work well for this number. \\"California Girls\\" celebrates the joys of young love and the band never misses a beat! \\"I Get Around\\" features the band singing really well with a terrific melody boasting key and tempo changes that show they're truly pros! \\"Surfin' Safari\\" also works well as The Beach Boys happily sing of going surfing with their girlfriends just off the sandy beach--great!<br /><br />\\"Fun, Fun, Fun\\" showcases the joy we all feel when we're young and get our first taste of real freedom. \\"Fun, Fun Fun\\" has a great guitar arrangement; and they sing and harmonize flawlessly throughout this fine number. Love that organ, too! \\"Little Deuce Coupe\\" gives us a great tune about a young man's love for his car; and of course The Beach Boys deliver this without missing a beat! I like the percussion on \\"Little Deuce Coupe,\\" too. Moreover, \\"Be True To Your School\\" really brings back fond memories of junior high school dances. \\"Be True To Your School\\" sports a great melody with an upbeat melody to celebrate school pride and a sense of community we all felt with our classmates.<br /><br />\\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" highlights The Beach Boys singing of the universal human experience of longing for true freedom when we can live with our lovers without parental interference. This fine ballad gives us the band harmonizing as well as they ever did; and the drums enhance the natural beauty of \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice,\\" too. \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" picks up the tempo just a bit as the boys sings of how they want to dance with their girlfriends to some gold old fashioned rock and roll music. The backup chorus works well for \\"Rock And Roll Music;\\" and the band delivers this very well! I predict that you will enjoy \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" very, very much.<br /><br />\\"Barbara Ann\\" uses the name of a woman to evoke an image in each man's mind of the perfect girl for him; and this tune lacks nothing--this music is all THAT good. The \\"chatter\\" on this number conjures up images of a typical high school dance--great! In addition, \\"Heroes and Villains\\" really rocks well as The Beach Boys bat this one straight out of the ballpark! Listen also for \\"Kokomo,\\" a ballad dedicated to that perfect remote little island resort where we can all go with our lovers to have the ultimate romantic experience. \\"Kokomo\\" is a more recent hit for The Beach Boys; and this more than proves they never lost their style!<br /><br />\\"I Can Hear Music\\" again features great harmonizing and guitar; and the tracks available for download end beautifully with their classic hit entitled \\"Good Vibrations.\\" The various tempo and key changes on \\"Good Vibrations\\" makes this number very, very special; and the passion a man feels for his woman gets expressed clearly with a stupendous musical arrangement. I again predict that you will like \\"Good Vibrations\\" very, very much. This is classic rock at its best!<br /><br />The Beach Boys will always be remembered fondly for their excellent music; and their ballads dealt with so many universal emotions and experiences that their music remains timeless. These songs will always be brilliant!oll Music;\\" and the band delivers this very well!

B0052UZIFA|4.0|Game is fun and in the beginning can waste a ton of time. Eventually, like with all games it gets old and that happened to me within the first week that I had gotten the game. Glad it was free but like almost all games I don't think I'd buy it...
0545128285|5.0|I bought this book once it was available to the public. I love it. The stories are creative and full of magic. I think I have read the book cover to cover about 20 times for myself and more times than I can count for the children that I babysit. It's a great book for adults and children and a wonderful addition to any Harry Potter book collection.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|An excellent port of the iphone /ps3/360 game of the same name. This has all the bells and whistles of its iphone cousin.    The title has great animations, great sound effects and good music.  This game has an excellent game play style and a certain comical charm that makes this one stick in your head long after its back in your pocket.    This is classified as a tower defense/strategy game. However don't let this scare you away. I don't usually play those types of games  either, however after giving this game a chance I couldn't quit playing !!! It makes the difference with it's easy to pick up game play, great touch screen controls (that are better then it's console cousins button controls) and great style.    The downsides of it are very small.  When your phone goes to sleep/screen locks due to no input, upon resuming the game must load again to place you where you were which can take a min or two. Some users have reported the game crashing instead of reloading. If so disable the screen timeout in settings>display from the handsets main screen.    Overall a great game and well recommended.
