B004FGMDOQ|2.0|I really was hooked on this book from the cover and the initial story, but as it wore on, I began to realize this must be a young adult book or something.  I really enjoyed the photos, especially how the author wove them into the story.  I kept expecting a hook to explain all the happenings, but then it abruptly ended, while my kindle suggested I had 30 pages more.  I'm guessing there must be a sequel?
B00271DNP4|5.0|Watching this again, and with my daughter (reading the books now), and answering her questions, seeing her face marvel at some of the effects, it was awesome! Alfonzo got the story right, caught the many moments of humer within the growing darkness of Harry's world, and his continued exposure to new and sometimes dangerous magic.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I enjoyed the 1st season a lot and  was glad that we also had season 2 on our Amazon streaming. These characters are serious but still have a fun side  to them. I can't wait for the 3rd season to be available to us .I have never seen any of the actors in any thing else on T.V or movies, but the acting is first rate. Harvey is awesome and of course Mike is also, I love Donna and wish her and Harvey would have a story line, what  a twosome.
1579129129|5.0|Great illustrations.  I bought this book for my son who draws.  The pictures are both fascinating and clear on anatomical details.
B00D6QUJ6U|3.0|The concert is great and I'm glad I purchased it except... the sound only comes through in PCM stereo and not DTS! Also, the video portion is OK, but nowhere near Blu-Ray quality. Save some money and just buy the regular DVD.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Suspenseful and unpredictable as always! Introduction of several new characters create an even more in-depth view into the story. My only complaint is that with so many characters as it is it can get a little confusing. Can't wait for book six!
B00D6QUJ6U|5.0|every song you would wish for - and not in an specific order so it jumps from the disco to the UK hits - great album
B000VSAEYI|3.0|pool came without any spare patches also had 1 hole on the flooring<br />which was a disappointment since the kids couldn't used it for 2 days while i get the necessary<br />repairs
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|don't like the start up menu and the choice of tiles... was looking for an 'old school' mahjong game... don't need all the extras
B00BLRXDTQ|4.0|Great picture quality compared to DVD. It would be nice if there were more special features included. Also because of the resolution it is a wide screen blue ray , but that's just because of the age of the original film.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love playing hidden object games... this Game is good, kinda slow running on the kindle fire. If you like hidden object games play this one it's not bad.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Glad it's finally free! Best racing game on here! It's pretty addicting<br />The nitrogen is awsome! This is a must have game and I bet you will enjoy it!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this game! It goes fast, it's easy, and I don't have to spend a fortune for extras if I don't want to! What more could you ask for?
B006O6F4O6|3.0|Anyone have idea how to remove the armor once attached to the batpod?think to make it various style to put on dashboard.
1419702238|5.0|My son is a big fan of the book series and loves each one. Highly recommend for kids with a sense of humor and middle/high school blues
0385349947|2.0|What summed this book up for me is that she didn't realize that her two chldren had lice until they got on a plane - which tells me, she wasn't paying much attention to her children.<br /><br />I'm not a \\"working mother\\" - but I found myself becoming every more irritated with her ideas.  Most women have to balance several needs in choosing and maintaining a career - not just children/spouse but often parents, as well - remember the old saying - a son is a son until he takes a wife, a daughter is a daughter for the rest of her life.  Not choosing to aspire to the height of one's profession isn't a cop out, it is making a choice, often a painful choice.
1419705849|5.0|My son really loves the book series, he has read them all. Very appropriately funny for kids. review has minimum word requirement, how funny.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My little boy loves to do these puzzles and especially likes the balloons that come out at the end when the puzzle is completed. Cute app to keep little ones entertain, especially when there is no internet connection!
0446672653|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! I just finished his other book &#34;Many lives, Many master&#34;. It truly changed my life & how I perceive death & the after life.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|If your looking for some action entertainment with fairly low expectations this movie will do.  It wasn't horrible, but once you have to say that about a movie, well, that's certainly not an endorsement.  Usually Bruce Willis can carry a movie but the whole thing was uninspired. I was torn between 2 and 3 stars.  If they let you choose halves, it would have 2 /12.  The Last Stand - Arnold's newest movie of this same genre was much better, and Karl Urban was much better in Dredd, also same genre, so I recommend this only as a last resort.
B003CBVU30|1.0|Really wanted this to be funny, but was very disappointed. Wouldn't recommend, also lots of foul language. Not family friendly.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I saw this at the theater and then a few times on TV.  I decided to buy it. I love the music!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|mcEwan can write.  He has plot and characters.  This book starts off a page-turner but slows down to a crawl when Tom becomes the center of our heroine's interest.  The ending is clever but over-written.  That being said, I'm not sorry I read this.  Ian McEwan knows how to craft a story and even when it's less than his best it's better than most.
0694013013|4.0|I'm happy with this purchase, my 6 year old loves reading and this is one of his favorites books, great price.
B0055D3EFU|4.0|This movie starts out fairly mundane. Kid, family, new home. I couldn't help but think that this was going to be another Poltergeist or Paranormal activity. I half expected to have a jump scare within the first few minutes. Nope, didn't happen.<br /><br />However, the opening was more about you identifying with the characters and getting to know them better. I was really rather bored about 15-20 minutes into it. There's quite a bit of foreshadowing in the beginning, however.<br /><br />Then things start getting creepy. Typical poltergeist happenings, followed by several other scaries and a whole lot of creepy. Some awkward long dialogue scenes later in the movie with extreme close-ups on the actors faces really killed the mood. Still, the creepy factor really added up and startled everyone who was watching it with me, including myself. A for effort.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book!  From start to finish, it was hard to put down.  The story is told wonderfully to reel you in.
B008VLWE5E|1.0|This is by far the worst 99 cents I have ever spent on any Kindle book.<br />The digital translation is just horrid. Punctuation/spelling are completely absent and the overall verbage is nonsensical at best.<br />The illustration examples are barely above an intro to drawing or intro to anatomy class text.<br />Wish I had never purchased it.  Oh well, you get what you pay for.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|This was a nice read. Another college story but good enough to hold an adults attention. Would now like to read Walking Diaster and see the guys side.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Gene Roddenberry would be so PROUD!!!  I am a first generation trekker and my son  even more so. We always watch the movies and critique them afterwards. After this movie he sent a voicemail that stated he had just watched the &#34;second greatest STAR TREK movie ever!&#34; ( can you guess what his choice for #1 must be?!) Keep them coming,PLEASE!  a trekkie from Nebraka
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|I think Tina Fey is hilarious so I bought this book. But I thought the book was boring. I couldn't finish it. Good for those who really want to know all about her life etc.
B000FBFN1U|2.0|Did not like all the nasty language in all this series.  It did not add nothing to the story. Just made a good novel become trash.
B007SGM084|5.0|After reading the first book I didn't think it was for me but &#34;SURPRISE&#34; it left you with so many questions that you had to continue reading into the second book.  It evokes all emotions which is right up my alley to keep me going on to the next.  Great beach reading.
0307271080|4.0|Smooth, lovely writing but too long!  Full of the politics and corruption of the country.  Every country has many stories.
B00002N9ER|5.0|I bought these for use on my sailboat--I use maglites because they are so durable and storing them on a sailboat is rought because they roll all around.  But these mounting brackets solve that problem and provide a very secure mount for the 3-cell maglites flashlights!
081297381X|2.0|I was delighted to find this book at such a reasonable price for one of my elderly clients but was horrified that she had to pay 3 times more for the postage!  This was only shown to me at the end of paying for the book - and by the time I contacted her to ask if she wanted me to go ahead it was too late to cancel the order!!<br />I will think twice before ordering again!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I'm watching all the seasons..the characters are developing and growing more endearing.  I like how I see the same actors/tresses whenever I watch British stuff - it makes watching british tv so much more fun.
0345525558|5.0|How could flowers tell a story?  The use of flowers names to tell a story drew my attention.<br />Once hooked the story just flowed and I could not stop reading.  A gem of writing.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Nothing special: An alarm clock app that does what it says it will, with no problems. Easy to set.  I like the old fashioned alarm it comes with (along with other options).
B002KGKH5A|4.0|If you like the White Stripes then your probably not reading this as you already added it to your cart-  You will not be disappointed.  If you not a fan of the White Stripes then there is still a good chance you will like this.  But I enjoy the music and some of the best songs are not full live versions which is why i gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  Video and Audio quality are great!
B00BQ1D7BQ|5.0|A great album both artistically and in song variety--songs written by Neil Young during CSN&Y days, Elmore James, & even Iggy Pop!  Amazon delivered right on release day, as promissed when I advance ordered
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I'm still playing with this app and figuring it out but seems like a good way to keep random notes organized
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Lots of violence but also funny. The movie does not take itself too seriously. I liked it and recomment it.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I have tried them all and keep coming back to Tubemate.  This is the most complete one.  It also gives you the option of what video size you want to download in (720, 1080) which I really like.<br /><br />Great way to snag videos that you like on Youtube.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|I won't comment on the content of the movie since the material speaks for itself. It is just as much fun as a Star Trek movie can be. I will however comment of the release itself... there are NO EXTRAS on the DVD version AT ALL which really makes the purchase of said disk (and in a crushed box sent from Amazon to boot). In this case, the franchise has taken a total dive when really being concerned about the people who have loved and watched Star Trek since the mid-1960's.<br /><br />Shame on you Paramount. Stop trying to sell crap for too much money. Very very, very, disappointed.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Love these controllers.  I have two of them, and they work fantastic.  Battery life is really good, especially if you set them to turn off after 5-10 minutes of no use via the PS3 accessory menu.<br /><br />I also love the ergonomics of the controller.  Its fits nice and secure in your hand.  Cant go wrong with black.  Mine still look new!
1451696191|5.0|What a great book about growing up.  Loved the movie, now love the way the book was written. Look forward to reading more of his books.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Its not the best. Its a little bit old so the effects may not be very good, BUT, two things:<br /><br />-The plot is so epic<br /><br />AND (read this) believe me,<br /><br />-This show only goes better and better. On the second or third season its the best show EVEEEEEER.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|fun, action, great stars.... what else could you want? rent it - you'll enjoy it!<br />then see the sequel - it is great too!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest has some REALLY great ideas for DIY projects and for just about anything you could want... great recipes, super decorating ideas, etcl.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Just couldn't put the book down.  It was a rollercoaster of emotions.  This is an absolute must read and going down on my list of favorites.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Very fun game.  Wish there were more free coins so I could play more often.  I would recommend this game to all.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|Marginal movie at best. Had higher expectations. Most of my disappointment rests with the lack of imagination. The script seems like it was taken from an 80's action movie (Cobra 2?). Characters and set seem like they were recycled from another movie. Even the action sequences seem either remarkably bland or familiar from some 80s movie.<br />Not surprisingly the movie doesn't address at all the moral ambiguity of the original comic - but that wasn't to be expected.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|i thoroughly enjoy the lovely graphics and soothing music. as long as you are patient, game gives you plenty of opportunities to earn pearls.
1476733953|5.0|Having just had surgery on my arm, I've had nothing to do but read and write for the last week. I decided to give \\"Wool\\" a try and got lost in it. Eight hours later, I finished it. This is an incredible story told by a very talented author. I have already purchased \\"Shift\\" and \\"Dust\\" and can't wait to begin them later on tonight. I am an independent author also, and you are an inspiration for all of us hoping to tell a story that captures the interest of so many readers. Great Jog, Hugh!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Get this game it's awesome  I say it's to awesome for words<br />RACEING WAS NEVER THIS AWESOME before just get the app
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The first two books were good!  Had a really hard time getting through this one. Did not hold my interest and a whole lot of nothing happened throughout this book.  Probably will not finish the series.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Very enlightening. It's interesting to get information about what really went on in those early Christian years. I'm looking forward to the rest of the episodes.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This a good app to have beautiful background it moves and the live weather is accurate. I recommend people to buy this app.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|A lot of people that I would love to personally remove from this saga. Hopefully someone will take care that king henry 8 will pay for his egotism.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept me interested the entire time! I could not put this book down. This was an excellent choice for book club.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is addictive! I have played hundreds of times! It is excellent and the ads are not that annoying. I hardly notice them anymore
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I liked the book, but there are lots of open ended stories that have not been answered. So, of course, I cannot wait until the next book comes out. I nope nothing happens to Tom Clancy.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|One thing that Clancy's always done is his homework...how it works...how it fits in with his plot and characters and this book is no exception. It's what I've come to expect and appreciate about Tom Clancy!
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|Captain Vorpatril meets his match in more ways than one and accidentally is connected to a mysterious and beautiful young lady. His heart is kind and cannot turn down a damsel in distress. There are many references to his cousin, Miles, and even a cameo appearance in the book. It is full of humor, in-laws, and family. I really liked this book. I would read another book about Ivan. Especially if she can match the humor in this book.
B000067FP8|5.0|I loved the first one, the music, the feel and the little animatronics were cute and easy to suspend belief on and the magic of buying a pet that has a monstrous dark side.  The only part I didn’t like about the first one was the two main actors and they managed to make it to the second.  At the time this was released I was a bit bummed it didn’t have the feel of the first one, felt more campy and the attempt the first one made at being a bit creepy.  Now, after years of reviewing this one is my favorite of the two, all the crazy variations on gremlins, the super smart one really makes the last half of the film.  I make sure to get this one in the rotation around the holidays, it is a lot of fun.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|This isn't even worth my time to write this review. a complete waist of time. why am I doing it?
B0010T0OCY|4.0|This is science fiction bordering on science fantasy with a heavy dose of a noir mystery. It feels like watching a gumshoe who's best leads are in the shadows, most of which are in his own head. The story is good but told in a whispered way that you will have to pay attention to else you will easily get lost. I did the first go round, so much so I was bummed I purchased the movie. Don't get me wrong, I liked the premise, a city that changes shape and personality every night.<br />Rufus and Kiefer as actors and their characters were interesting and they seemed to have a good time playing them or at least do a great job doing it. I have seen it a few times and I don't think I understand the urgency of their characters, seems like time isn't a thing as the aliens have control over a lot of the things going on.<br />If Sci-fi is you thing and you haven't seen this under rated movie check it out, it is worth the time.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|Program says can't Parse the program.  I have no idea what to do from here, I've tried to download it several times.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|This movie had a strong feel of Van Helsing from a few years back (04) but it was a lot more into embracing the campy feel of it.  The weapons, the language and the feel wasn’t so much the “days of old” but more like an alternate universe but I thought it worked.  The actors were all pretty on some level, the monster type witches still had a good style and not to spooky and even things that should have been dirty still looked like they were brand new.  The action was fun and I had a good time for the run time, the twists didn’t feel too surprising though and only one of the deaths near the end was a bit sadder than I expected it to be.
B00914JWSW|4.0|This album is one every Streisand fan must have. It does have a couple of songs that I personally do not care for, but, hey, she can make any song sound good!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app has everything I need and I use it everyday. I cannot think of anything I'd add or change.
B000I9U9X6|5.0|This movie is probably Audrey Hepburn's best. It is the story of a marriage, and through the brilliant script of Frederic Raphael it gives unique emotional glimpses into all of us. The chronology of the film is brilliant, as is the direction, photography, and certainly the acting. Albert Finney is great opposite Hepburn. You should see it twice to get the full impact of this story. But when you have watched it once, you're bound to watch it the second time, and the third, and again and again.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|I love history of religions, particularly the near eastern religions, and I usually love Reza Aslan's writing style.  However, while this book was certainly readable and the material was interesting, I was a little side-tracked by Aslan's narrative.  I found many parts to be redundant, and it really felt like the book could have been a lot shorter.  If you have an interest in learning about early Christian history, this book is very informative, particularly with respect to the cultural and socio-economic details.  However, there is a little bit of unnecessary repetition.
0767827791|5.0|This beautiful film is one that everybody should see. Set in a small Kansas town, it spans only 24 hours in the lives of Hal and Madge, who meet by accident and fall in love by magnificent design of destiny. Their story electrifies the screen, and will live in your heart always as a token of the beauty of youth, and the miracle of true love.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It is habit forming, way too much fun.  I hope you have time on your hands when you start this game.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its fun and random I love to play it when I'm not doing anything. and the little girl I watch loves it to she wants to play it allthe time
1583334386|3.0|The book, using an assortment of studies from psychology and neuroscience, makes a case for strengthening pause-and-plan which enhances willpower to help modulate one's impulses. Unlike many self-help books, the author does focus on lessons gleaned from meaningful studies (she calls it \\"science-help\\") and, as such, the message conveyed is overall sound.<br /><br />Two remarks:<br /><br />1. The book's writing could be improved. It also follows a self-help formulaic messaging format. She gave a lecture at Google (also on youtube) where she makes an effective case.<br /><br />2. The part where this book is weak: how to improve willpower in the long run. The author goes through a laundry list that includes slow breathing, meditation, exercise, getting sufficient sleep, relaxing, etc.<br /><br />Many of the studies she mentions are interesting, but of mixed value as the behavior modification results are related to the short-term, at the time scale of months. Meaningful changes are measured in years. Dieters know this very well. And the long-term failure rate high.<br /><br />Bottom line: what the author recommends -- being more aware of one's impulsive tendencies and training oneself to be less susceptible -- is well-intentioned and useful. However, it is the difficulty implementing them in daily life, under real-life conditions, in the long run, that is the vexing problem. And on this front, the book falls short.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I loved this book/story.  I wanted to read it since the movie is on the horizon.  I'd met the author years ago but never got around to reading his books.  This story is very creative and vivid.  It was one of those books you just don't want to put down.  Hopefully the movie will do it justice!  I am not a big reader per se so I don't have a comparison really.  The few books I do read - I make sure they'll be good! Anyway - another book I recommend is The Host, awesome story (the movie didn't quite capture it all unfortunately).
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle Monae just keeps getting better with time. A nice continuation in her oeuvre. It's been playing almost non-stop in my house for the past few days. I know this isn't a very substantive review, but I wanted to add my 5 stars to her recent musical effort.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|This is a book you will enjoy reading several times because it's content is interesting and extremely helpful.  If you struggle with memory or just want to improve your recall, this is a must read.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|I have enjoyed playing this game but recently it was updated to include a video ad for Microsoft's new tablet. The video interrupts play and causes numerous problems. Additionally the game seems to have more difficulty connecting to its server.  Overall the updates instead of improving the game have actually degraded it. This is indicative of the level of suuport provided for this game by the designer.
B00AQMSJI2|3.0|The game is fun but I'm a little lost on how to get more rubies you don't get a lot of help on how to protect your ship and most of the time the pirates kill your ship right away. I stopped fixing my boat because I got tired of trying to repair it and to beef up my protection and it not working and now  needing to beef up my boat but not having enough rubies. I hope it gets better soon or I think I will give up this game to.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Denzel Washington does an outstanding job in this movie however the writing left him little to work with. The substance abuse themes run throughout the story and the director does a good job of making you root for, or hate the characters as needed. The problem is Hollywood gets in the way. You can see the ending coming about 30 minutes before it does and despite Washington's best efforts, the excellent acting is just not enough to save this film. It's almost as if you're watching Shawshank Redemption in reverse, right down to the last scene. The dangerous and self destructive alcoholic theme has been explored in movies like Leaving Los Vegas. This movie incorporates the danger to others into that familiar plot. I almost gave this movie two stars but the strength of Denzel's acting pulled it up to an OK. If I had paid $10.00 to see it I'd want my money back.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|This game is an amazing game. It works your brain by showing you pictures and you have to figure out how they are similar to each other or what the words are
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Lee Child did it right on this one! He kept me in suspense almost to the very end and some well placed twists to boot! Plenty of action and lots of deducing going on! So far one of the best in the Reacher series with a plot that twists & turns and keeps you guessing and hanging on. Sometimes I couldn't put it down. Just read it & you'll love it!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It is amazing but lacks the realistic driving that real racing 3 has. Otherwise great in all departments. The textures and arcade style are put together masterfully.
B002KVCA1O|4.0|My first stones album I've been happy with this I'll the cool tunes are on this album and the price is right also
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It works very well, and has nice features that are very easy to use. It can be used by all ages and is very easy to set. Also provides a very nice night light.
B003QSPTAY|4.0|Good movie for more than one generation to watch together.  Younger girls like the (mild) romance and the story is interesting enough for even the grownups.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|This is the first review I wrote on Amazon, this movie is very good, both my boyfriend and I like it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved the show. Missed the season when it aired on tv. Was able to watch it for a reasonable price on amazon.
B00BT8Y774|5.0|Oh my awesome movie. I had to replace ours. It was lost. Kids were very upset. The seller had a few copies and it was a great price. Fast shipping as well. Kids are happy again and so am I. even I watched it with them
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Huh!?  I do not get the purpose of this.  Anyone with thumbs can master the game without this useless app.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is an awesome show! I was introduced to it by my sister and we couldn't stop watching!! I am re-watching the show from Season 1 and am halfway through Season 3. The story line is so interesting (twists and turns!) and the actors are wonderful! Everytime I watch it, I get the urge to drink tea out of fancy teacups LOL!!
B00C7NKPPS|3.0|Thought the sound quality should be better but it's not for my taste - yet love Wings and their music so gave it three stars
B00466HN6S|5.0|My Grandson Issic, loves this movie. He calls it the Bunny Movie.. :-) He kept asking for the movie, so we struck a deal, I buy you the Bunny Movie, and you have to start going potty in the toilet. He did it, so he got the movie.
B001RCD2DW|1.0|I bought ,as described, a &#34;made in austria&#34; item, and I have recieved a chinese one!! I feel cheated! !
B007IXWL2C|3.0|First, the author uses the word \\"murmur\\" far too often!  It's hard to believe that an over controlling, temperamental, childish billionaire and a simple, desperate to keep her man happy girl truly love each other. Besides fighting, the only thing this pair have in common is their unrealistic sex life. I honestly got fed up with the sex  scenes and skimmed over them after a while. The storyline could have been summed up in one book leaving plenty of room for sex too.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is the best racing game ever. because this is fun to play. Gta vc and gangstar Vegas and this game is all my favourite games.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|Wife is a fan club member and anxiously awaited the blu-ray release. From a reference standpoint, the blu-ray version of the Sticky and Sweet tour makes this defective \\"festival of audio and video mishaps\\" even more apparent.<br /> We rec'd it and first obstacle is the poorly authored menu set-up. Unless you hit left curser, you can't get into the set-up menu.<br />Next curious authoring decision. Audio defaults to DTS 2.0 {Have not seen this in a long, long time.}<br /> Select DTS HD 5.1 audio and all you get are left front and rear, and muffled bass with no right channel info. Confermed this with 5 other properly mastered blu-rays. Obviously, the blu-ray house that issued this never QC'd the final mixes / product.<br />  This is the masterpiece that Madonna and Guy and crew spent months mixing and editing ?<br /> I personally think this was a \\"quicky\\" done by an \\"MTV wannabee video editor\\" with the most annoying jump cuts, 40% low def camera shots edited in, bizarre filtering, washed out color. What the heck where they thinking ?<br /> Honestly, there are few youtube hand held camera videos of this tour that have 90% more \\"be there\\" quality, and somewhat passable audio quality.<br /> If this is what Mizz M and crew think is a hi-def blu-ray experience then I guess her day has come and gone.<br /> This is bizarre beyond belief. Sad, sad, sad.<br />Epic failure IMHO.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|I like transformers, but this one was just too much CGI, and not all that good CGI at that.  It was kind of like setting off a 5000 pack of  Black Cat firecrackers, the first 10 seconds is exciting, after that it just becomes a bunch of loud popping noise.  Adding a super model to the mix just shows that they director knew the film could not stand on CGI and story line alone.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This is one of my favorites of all time.<br /><br />Steven King wrote this book a while back now but it is in my opinion a classical scary book. OK no I have not read the book yet but intend on getting the book. The movie though is one of my favorites for a good scare in a orderly fashion. I am not sure how to re-state that but it is a good one by Mr. King. Oh yeah I like the car.
B001H1UQRI|5.0|This movie is great! It came out when I was in high school, its got amazing rewatch value and is ultra quotable.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Very happy. Product was as described. Shipped fast and was in new condition. I was kept informed from billing to shipping.  Highly recommend using as I will be in the future.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was amazing. I couldn't stop turning the pages and I would love to see more books like this
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|Easy to adjust treble or bass to your liking and once you get it set up not to much more to do. For me added more depth in the sound the way i like it
1574214276|5.0|Great book-lots of ideas and patterns as to how to make a particular zentangle. Inspiring. I used some of the information as a projcct.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Purchased this with the powerfast  charger and it is a huge improvement over the original charger. Fully charged in about three hours. Cable is sturdy, fits good and works well.
1878424319|4.0|Short book, good read. Four very simple things that are not so simple to put into practice. The beginning and the end were kind of silly but the chapters on the 4 actual agreements I enjoyed.
B0065RIJ3W|5.0|If you want food security read this book. You can start small and cheap, then expand.Wonderful book.<br />Dr George Tomes

B00C061I3K|5.0|Not what I expected from Daft Punk, but after few listenings, you just can't stop having it in loops :)
B008ZCWFEE|2.0|The steps are so simple and incremental. My son was enjoying the challenge of figuring it out and moving to the next level. However, on Kindle, we very quickly hit a glitch in the program and could go no farther in the game than the second level. Dragon Box customer service has refused to respond.
B000BNI90O|5.0|I absolutely love these recordings!  I saw all of the movies and thoroughly enjoyed them all!!  It was nice to be able to buy these recordings as 'keepsakes' and they were in perfect condition.  I would recommend this purchase and let them know where I got it.<br />- from Amazon - LJ
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|This is another movie where the vast majority of it's success rests on the shoulders of a young boy's talent.  Thomas Horn carried the load with exquisite acting abilities.  He captured my heart and brought me to tears several times.  Great movie that handles a tragedy with behind the scenes truth and tenderness.  Don't miss it.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I enjoy using this app because it helps me know how low my Kindle Fire's battery is,  &amp; how much longer I can use it until it needs recharging.
B005LJK3AC|1.0|This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. The only thing that could save this movie is about 30 minutes of Jennifer Anniston being fully nude
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|This is an entertaining couple of hours. There is a twist you don't see coming till it's on you. Sure there are some Planet of the Apes moments ...but all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it even in SD and wish I'd seen it on the big screen, that would have been awesome. (note to self, get bigger TV) I'm not going to delve into character development or cinematography those things are really not what I'm looking at. I'm looking at was I able to reasonably suspend disbelief and did I get drawn in by the characters and the plot. This movie ticked all those boxes.<br /><br />122 people gave it 1 star - that must just be a lot of people who hate Tom Cruise. There is no way this is a one star movie ...I mean I don't think I even gave Prometheus one star and that movie was truly stupendously awful...oh wait, yes I did give it one star. :)<br /><br />Watch this movie, I enjoyed it, I think you will, too.<br /><br />1 star off because it's not the best movie I ever saw.<br /><br />Oh and Amazon really really needs to up it's streaming game. I want to be able to stream on my computer in HD and I want it to not constantly need to buffer even in SD (I'm running a consistent 17+ in mbps.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|What impressed me most about this movie was the attention to detail when it came to the special effects- and at this point in my life, it's very hard to impress me with special effects. But JJ Abrams and friends really nailed it with this one, creating a universe that is at times ridiculously colorful and at others convincingly dark, with CGI so seamless that you don't even think of it as CGI- it just blends in with everything else. It's a fantastic, fun thrill ride. I wasn't particularly impressed with the characters' personalities or their dramas, but I suspect those are tailored to appeal to the old school fans, so I'm indifferent on those matters. I will, however, give credit where credit is due, and the producers and director of this movie certainly deserve it. I watched it on Blu-ray from Redbox for $1.00, and I certainly got my money's worth! The video and audio transfer is superb, and those colors (and sounds!) really pop.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this a lot. Very fun and addicting. Like temple run but much better and more entertaining. I love minions
B008U3NU38|5.0|ATTENTION CLASH FANS. RUN don't walk. RUN and get the new Clash box! All the studio albums (other than \\"Cut the Crap\\" and the American version of the first LP) have been newly Remastered. And they are miles above the last edition. It's night and day. The sound is STELLAR. All the albums have LYRIC SHEETS!!!!! There's several CD's of out-takes and singles, a DVD, and some cool swag. Completely worth the substantial investment.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Watched movie one and two and they were both great.  They are exciting, believable and my significant other and I loved every minute.
B00DHHWY9I|5.0|I really like this rendition of The Great Gatsby. I would watch it every day if I had time! The musical score is perfectly aligned with the scene setting. Brilliant!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|These two together is quite a duo.  Love the movie and the concept.  It is twisted and unpredictable.  The flashes of things on the screen is interesting also.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I bought this to go with the PoweFast Kindle charger. I am very pleased. it obviously works fine, but I am loving the length. I can charge and read now (at the same time) without having to be closer to the outlet and accidently unplugging it from the Kindle.
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Mark Wahlberg always seems to put out a watchable movie.  I liked it and would rent anything from him.  Thumbs up
B003G4W49C|5.0|Reading Ender's Game the first time was certainly the best, but it's hard not to read it over and over again. Hopefully the movie does it justice because the story is exciting and special.
B008R14YBK|4.0|I like the songs very much but I like the acoustic versions better, too bad they aren't on this cd.<br />Especially 'Blonde' and '5:15' are my favourites, but the other songs are great songs as well :-)
B00F35BV64|5.0|Not many movies can top their first one when it comes to a series. Nicely done! And having my favorite actors in it wasn't a bad thing either! XD
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics and tons of options.  I like the competition element of the game and the sound effects are spot on.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Loved it!  It was a great and meaningful move with a great deal of history.  It is an important movie.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I contacted Amazon because my kindle fire that I bought charging port seemed to be starting to falter. Agent on the line asked about the charger and believed it was an issue with the old charger since they went away from the style I had to this one. They sent me this new style of charger and as soon as I plugged it in it immediately started charging. I didn't have to position the kindle a certain way or wiggle the connection at the port. It fit more snug in the port than the old charger did. I have only had to charge it twice so far but so far so good. If you have an older fire and the original charger that is a wired connected AC to micro USB and are having connection problems give this a try and hopefully it helps you like it has me thus far. The agent I spoke to when I called listened to my description of what I was experiencing and I was outside my 1 year standard warranty so was trying to find out options. The agent suggested to try this new charger as it was a different style so it might be a known issue but they shipped it out to me at no charge to see if it would work. Very happy customer and a very nice and polite yet helpful agent. Even if it hadn't worked the experience of the situation would have earned a good rating but since it seems to have fixed my problem 5 stars for sure! Keep up the great work Amazon!!!
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|It has been a long time since a book captivated me as much as Americanah. This is a topic that I have often thought about, but had zero insight into: being black in America as a non-American. Adichie's writing is moving - and brings out these hard-to-discuss topics all while building an amazing story capturing the power of love over time.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|This was a great movie.  They need to make more movies like this.  This movie is an action pack movie with some comedy.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|I don't know - people love a happy ending yet this left me a bit of a blah feeling at the end.  It's not a bad movie, it's just not awesome.
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing book! Loved the story and enjoyed the read. I would recommend to a friend for sure. I plan to continue with the next book.
B008LH4YYC|5.0|This program is more then usefull and essential when you want to root your kindle, which I did through a process provided by Amazon.
B0096BIENY|5.0|I enjoy listening to this group. Even though they are from four different countries and have not been singing very long together, they sound as if they have sung together since childhood. Their are voices are rich and blend together perfectly. As you listen to them, you feel you are drinking a fine wine. Their voices are beautiful!! I recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys listening to a well-blended sound of voices that make you smile!!
B00CH87HF4|3.0|This deserving of the dungeon hunter name the quest are fun the areas diverse blah blah. Although some dungeons might be too long. I swear enemies just kept coming and coming! And it honestly got really annoying dying because I didn't have the right equipment. One last thing tough is the graphics, a a huge pet peeve of mine the kindle fire has wayyyy better capabilities than that. I swear every game I get from you guys never look as good as it can be. Oh and don't give me that..Oh the kindle core doesn't have these capabilities bull look at some gAmes in our Appstore some made by unity look realistic and awesome with the lighting a d close attention to detail. Although the your gAmes like cough cough asphalt t.8 and blitz brigade are a slightly better looking than your past gAmes you can still do loads better. In fact I'm going to your homepage and complain about this..... for all the other people who have some experience making gAmes  and know why the gAmes grAphics are toned down. Wether it's the length of the game or something.... please tell so I know I have a right to complain about this.
B004WR125O|4.0|I bought this item for the ONKYO TX-NR616 tunner, after reading some of the reviews I was leery but figured for the price I would give it a try. Plugged it in and was on the network with in a min, works great no issues. Worth the prices..
0812968255|5.0|Great book- very neat and crisp. Brand new! Saved a bunch of money! I am very happy with my purchase!
B00005OKSJ|4.0|This is a fine representation of Bernstein's touch.  However, his performances of works by Barber and Delius, just to mention a couple, seem superior to me.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Excellent game very addictive.Have had a few minor glitches 're buying bingo credits but nevertheless the game is great.Bingo Blitz has to be the best in its field at this time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really loved this game it takes me to different worlds. My Daughter started on this game and I loved the experience it gives me.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I am happier with this weather application than the previous application I had chosen.  This loads fairly quickly.  The only issue I have is the quantity of information takes a while to load.
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|This is a great album; it's a wonderful combination of fun, catchy and heartfelt songs.  Her vocals are flawless; it's a joy to listen to her sing.  I've been a fan of hers since the beginning, and I feel this is one of her best.  I have my favorites, but I like every single song on this album, and that doesn't happen very often for me.<br /><br />Buy this and enjoy it thoroughly, like I'm doing.  Great job, Sheryl!
B00DNLXDUW|3.0|Seems to work effectively with gmail and others but there a few issues. Search function is disabled even though there is a button for it.  Also, the program freezes occasionally requiring it to be closed.
B00D5LC4GY|2.0|Every time I've seen a game with \\"Tris\\" tacked on to the end, it's been a Tetris clone. I don't know what these guys were thinking, but this is NOT a Tetris clone.<br /><br />What is it? It's a VERY simple jigsaw puzzle game without a picture. They merely create a grid of squares, cut the squares into pieces, stick the pieces around the edge, and you put them into place. They award more \\"stars\\" for a solution if you use fewer placements. The pieces aren't stuck in place once you position them on the game board, you can move them around if you need to.<br /><br />Other reviewers mentioned interface issues and typos, but frankly I didn't get that far. I wasn't looking for a toddler level jigsaw puzzle game, and as soon as it became apparent that's what this is, I was done with it.<br /><br />If you happen to enjoy doing simple jigsaws of random blocky shapes more than I do, you might enjoy this. It just wasn't for me. I thought it was misleadingly named and showed virtually no imagination as a game.<br /><br />I'll go back to yesterday's FAotD and herd sugar granules around. That was fun.
B00C7JG0KG|4.0|In 2D this movie is 3 stars.<br />In 3D this movie is 5 stars.<br /><br />The main star of this film, is indeed the 3D presentation itself. Utterly fantastic! This is one (of only a handful) of movies that is actually better in its 3D format. You can use this movie to showcase your home 3D system to friends - they will be suitably impressed!<br /><br />Is it worth a view in 2D? Yes. However, it will seem a little over-long. The actors are fine, the story is fine, the visual effects are very good (but will seem \\"over done\\"). One of the best sequences are the singing munchkins, which is cut off mid-song as a joke. Makes me think this movie would have been better served as an all-out musical...<br /><br />Bottom line: a good movie, that is a must-see in 3D.
1423124960|5.0|She loves to listen to these stories and because there are many, it's nice to mix it up every once in awhile.<br />Great books for the little ones. Very fast shipping too!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Doesn't ask for your money 10x a minute! :)<br />Spend earned credits to upgrade vehicles, buy new ones or buy new tracks.<br />It's versatile and some skill is involved which is rewarding. Tracks are dynamic and feel different. Each track has special characteristics that make it unique. For example &#34;Highway&#34; is a smoother track with less technical climbing where you can reach higher speeds. &#34;Moon&#34; has low gravity. Good stuff.
B001JNNDDI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie despite the fact that it is not particularly my type.  It's quirky, its fun, it's charming.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|It was not that bad, better than the first one. It's nice to see all those actors together in one movie
B0068THAGY|4.0|I grew up across the river from Where the movie was shot, which is what led me to be interested in the movie. I found it to have a unique plot and enjoyed seeing the landscape of Weirton, WV displayed in the movie.
159413586X|5.0|Great series for adolescents to adults. Great adventure that is thoroughly entertaining and keeps you reading. Despite the predictableness of the ending, it keeps you reading.
B007SGM084|1.0|I felt like I was reading a book written for and by a teenager. It just didn't meet up with all the reviews.
034580404X|5.0|Steamy and disturbing at the same time.  Very sexy but I found the violent sex to be rather disturbing but the books were, nonetheless hard to put down.
B00594XOZU|3.0|All of a sudden it kept crashing :( mane I love this app but I don't know why it keep.crashing
B009VA1FN6|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in ages.  Had me guessing and then with the real sting at the end, never saw it coming, thoroughly recommend this one.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|of great use in refinding  former associates and people for networking in yourchosen  field of employment.great for laughs and recalling memories
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I have found everything that Amazon offers with their Kindle line of products to be excellent. This cable is well made, perfectly suited for the Kindle fast charger.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I liked the mystery, the twist's and turns in the story! I liked the surprise ending. The special effects were great. I also liked that it was NOT all about blood and gore! This proves that non stop violence is not necessary for an exciting movie! I can't think of another movie to compare it to.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Awesome app but you can't keep up with tokens unless you're on an iPhone or iPad where you can watch ads for more free tokens.
B000SVZIDA|5.0|This movie is LOVE and Music in one, and its great for romantics, as also does musical movies lover, like myself
B0071LLHO4|5.0|Already had Dare. Wanted it for the second disc. Fasination. Love the Human League. So I wasn't disappointed. Must have for any fan.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|On update, there is a recurrent parsing error that effectively makes the game unplayable at this time as you must update to play it.<br /><br />Otherwise..<br /><br />Enjoying the game. You do not have to purchase pearls if you do not wish to - it just then takes time and patience to grow plants.
B00DM12ANO|3.0|A magical styled love story. Smooth silky visuals. Dream like.  A fun escape from the usual blah clich&eacute;s.<br />A good date movie.
B00AS1Q93S|4.0|Actually, have not viewed yet; Cannot provide a comment at this time to reflect the quality of the DVD; Response about the actual movie would be a personal like or dislike.
1426308469|5.0|My son loves dinosaurs and this book is so full of informations and pictures of categorized dinosaurs from small ones to gigantic ones.  Each dinosaur is well explained and there are even pronunciation guides.  Well recommended!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I expected much of the book as Hosseini is a story teller who makes a foreign world seem present.  The family connections are both modern and exotic. I highly suggest a novel that educates the reader on the importance of seeing the larger world of family.
B00CE2G3AS|5.0|This is one of my old favorites, the transfer is really splendid, picture and color excellent the sound is really impresive, for a 80's movie. Highly recommended.
B00DWZHTRW|2.0|I realize this movie made a lot of money and is highly rated here on Amazon. Maybe I expect more from a film than most. I thought this movie was poorly written and just cheesy overall. Yes, some of the illusions was rather entertaining but enough to carry the movie? Not even close. The bar from Hollywood lowers yet again.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I find this to be another match-up game. There are a lot like this. It does have a few new set-ups, but it is basically the same as other Mahjong games.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Excellent book!! The first experiment still Has me in awe..! Wholly recommended and you must do the experiments they work!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Kids love it and I love it. Fun for the family. Cute and sweet for the little ones. Fun fun.

B004TI5N38|5.0|My first David Baldacci book!! And won't be my last. Great book! David Doesn't need to use foul language...he writes with tact and as a gentleman.  Thank you.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|The thing I didn't like was the stories were too short.  I love my Harry Bosch books.  Michael Connelly writes the absolute best crime dramas ever.  I never read one I did not like.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|Its a great movie! Great story line and you will love the ending!<br />buy this movie now what are you waiting for!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|If you a beginner Evermore is a good app to start using. After you get more experience then you may want to try something else.
B002BI6SMI|2.0|The story line and the characters were predictable. The bad guys were straw men. The dialog was halting. I give this movie a solid &#34;meh&#34;
B005PK56TA|5.0|One of my favorite tv series, love it. Can't wait to get caught up on series 2 shows that I have missed.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun, quirky game. Like much better than temple run. Must have if you like such games. Has game buy ins though.
148258798X|4.0|My son read this for his school and it gave him a new look about what happened back then and how it affected people.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|Had a pretty good story line to follow and the acting was okay. Makes you think how much of this could really be true for some folks??
B002ZG976U|3.0|The singing is great but the plot is very predictable and kind of silly.  It was just OK for me.
B00A8KJK7G|4.0|Was good and sad. The poor boy had no real friends but his dog that he loved more than anything. Then its gone. Enough watch and find out.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The novel was O.K. not sure I would read another novel written by this author.  I felt the characters were not very well developed.
B00AG51V8E|5.0|What can you say when an actor as good as Bruce Willis plays in it! He is still one of the greatest actors there is. Movie was great all the way to the end. Want more!!
B00AECGQF2|4.0|My daughter is five and she loves this app. She always watched television for twenty minutes before going to bed. She asked me if she could play this app now instead of watching television. I am so happy that I get a break from SpongeBob. Now she tries to do things with her own hair. I now have to hide the scissors.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I got into MTG 2012 and 2013 on the pc. Android version of 2014 feels just as awesome to play.
B0050DIWHU|5.0|informative, persuasive, and to the point. Great use of real examples and suggestions for how to improve the way you think about your career.
B002GTZSZU|5.0|I have owned this before. Beautiful period piece about Mozart. Acting is superb, especially F. Murray Abraham. A musty see, if you haven't.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Everybody is complaining about the ads... turn off wifi and data and ads won't show up! It's really that simple...<br /><br />Apart from that, the game it's extremely clever with superb cartoon style graphics.
B0036UMM84|5.0|Did not do well in box office, but this is a fab of mine. A rare opportunity to see Kris Kristofferson sing!...and with Barbra Streisand. Saw this when I was in high school so holds memories for My friends and I.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|The game itself is awesome....but the ads have hijacked my game at least thirty times this weekend.  Between the ad for Windows and the fish that take over causing you to lose your harvest, I am really disgusted.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This little app gives me piece of mind when I travel. I have faith that it will always wake me when at times the motel forgets to make the wake-up call. The well-lighted display is easy to see if one wants to check the time during the night.  It is easy to set, and one can choose the music that greets you in the morning.<br /><br />After it is set it runs while my Kindle Fire HD is closed and will not run down the battery.  If the unit is on a charger, it can be opened and viewed as a bedside clock.<br /><br />It's a great and useful app.
B00B78AIV0|5.0|This was a great read. I am glad that I bought it, I am sure I will be reading it again very soon.
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|What a lovely, timeless film.  The screenplay, the performances, the stunning location work in the Grand Tetons, Victor Young's memorable score; all tops.  I have always found Brandon de Wilde almost as hard to take as I later found Jar Jar Binks, but he is not so bad as to ruin such a great film.  The Blu Ray edition is nothing short of breathtaking.  Although originally photographed in the (full frame) aspect-ratio of 4x3, Paramount ruthlessly chopped off the top and bottom of the 35mm image to release it in the then-new widescreen format in 1953.  Incredibly, this cropped theatrical version earned cinematographer Loyal Griggs an Oscar!  If I had one complaint, it would be that the Blu Ray doesn't offer both aspect-ratio versions, like Criterion did when offering their magnificent Blu Ray release of \\"On the Waterfront.\\"
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|An amazing movie! I would recommend this to anyone! And the quality was amazing. Literally the best movie I've ever seen, it was just a rollercoastwr of emotions!
B000LL01N4|5.0|There is nothing better on a crisp fall day than a great cup of coffee, windows down, and this cd playing in my car. It's a great mix of classics.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It took awhile to get into the book, but once I did, I had a hard time putting it down.  Quite a psychological thriller.  Reactions in my book club were mixed only because of the nature of the characters themselves and not the book per se.
B00DHKKN6Q|1.0|I just didn 't find this game fun and felt that it really didn't do all I personally hoped for.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|What a great song! I never get sick of it. It is perfect for working out or cooking dinner or what ever. I love upbeat fun and slightly &#34;sexy&#34; music. This is a great one for my collection. ~ Jenny
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|All the complaints on the extras is pathetic. Lets talk about the movie itself. (MAYBE SOME SPOILERS). I am a die hard fan of all the movies and shows including TOS. The movie was great entertainment, great special affects, all actors did a well as expected job.<br />  Story direction: I am a little disappointed in the direction this story went or is going. I know there are dozens of storys to be used even from TOS that were never made into shows. Why remake a whole movie? Especially one that was probably the most successful? Its one thing to tweak threads from different storys but to rearrange and retell an entire movie and story line....I really expected more from Abrams. The movie was extremely fast paced and barely any time for any substantial dialogue. It teetered on the edge of lacking substance. The growing bond with Kirk/Spock/McCoy. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie but it seems they tried to pack so much into the movie it was busting at the seams with any and every tid bit of information of TOS history, including using old lines (some re-worded) from the original series or previous movies from the old cast. I think its ok to resemble some lines etc but don't just throw them in there just to have them in there. I do like the way Marcus and Nurse Chapel were brought into the story, very clever.<br />  Characters: Dr. McCoy--What was bothersome were the amount of cliched analogy's they had Dr. McCoy spouting off. At one point in the movie Spock said, \\"enough already with the analogy's\\". That was amusing but it was no longer amusing when they had McCoy continue doing these analogy's, in fact I would say JJ Abrams was on the edge of \\"SPOOFING\\" the good doctor. McCoy had very little insightful or useful dialogue throughout the whole movie. That was disappointing. We all love McCoy's attitude and sarcasm with Kirk and Spock, but they really wore it to death with every one liner cliche they could pack in there. McCoy deserves better than that.<br />  Spock: Although Zachary Quinto does a great job with Spock, the Spock character it seems has been softened for lack of better words. And what about this fling he has with Uhura? Pryor story? Originally written? I don't know, but it makes Spock a bit of a pansy, instead of a level headed Vulcan always in control. And what about \\"PON FAR\\"? I guess that's out the window now? I'm just not buyng this fling with Uhura. This movie had moments where he was indecisive and unsure of himself. That's not the Spock we know from past, even the young Spock from past. True he was young and still learning to cope with his human side. But if he wasn't in control as a Vulcan should be then he probably wasn't ready for life in general much less being a Star Fleet officer.<br />  Uhura: Great job by the actress but they have her character very lax & emotional, its not complimentary of a StarFleet officer nor to the original Uhura character. Scotty, Chekov and Sulu all do well and their characters flow well in these new movies.<br />  Kirk: Chris Pine does as well as expected on Kirk. Maybe just a little bit too lax in his command. I realize this is young Kirk and he is learning who he is. But even a young Kirk would actually command more respect than an older Kirk who's been around the block.<br />  Kahn: This guy did OK job, but he lacked the strong screen presence even the older Kahn gave us. Obviously no one can match Ricardo Montalban but if you cant find someone with equally or more  powerful substance on the screen, then dont do it at all. Even Kahn's character deserved some one better.<br />  Bottom Line: The movie is entertaining and very watchable. Although it is a remake of an older one, they did change it up enough to keep you guessing. But it wasn't enough to cover my disappointment of trying to do the remake in the first place. I am concerned on where Abrams is going with these characters. My other concern is ending up with a bunch of remakes of movies from the 80\\"s. These movies will stand the test of time, leave them alone. So far every single Star Trek Big Picture has been with an original story, even TNG movies never remade from an old old movie.<br />  The first Star Trek movie Abrams did offered us a great perspective of the whole crew and how they came to be, this movie although is entertaining, was not nearly as fresh and exciting as the previous one.<br />  Lets get some new material. There are literally dozens of books out there written over the years. For God sake, make a movie from one of them, stop trying to remake an old movie from the 80's that is already great. Whats next, \\"The Search for Kirk\\"..Lets just remake all the Star Trek movies and re-arrange the story's........JJ find some thing original and run with it.ill stand the test of time, leave them alone.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi is a beautifully written tale of love and loss, adventure and fantasy, that is truly a brilliant and thought-provoking read. It was a little slow starting, but keep reading! The adventure builds when Pi is left stranded on a lifeboat in the Pacific ocean with a tiger named Richard Parker. Rich in detail and description, this story had my rapt attention until the very end. Excellent! Will surely be a modern classic.
B005V1WYZC|5.0|This is one of those wonderful movies where you really care for all the characters. There are poignant touching moments as well as classic farce rivaling Blake Edwards at his best.  No matter the size of the role everyone shines in this movie. My wife and I have watched it several times and it never fails to leave us with a smile on our face and in our hearts. For anyone who enjoys the oft under rated RomCom genre here is one of those classics that totally validates the genre.  Feel good and funny.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I really liked this book.  As soon as I bought it I couldn't put it down.  I like how the author describes everything.  It seems so real.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love this show - It has drama, romance & action in each episode.  Must watch DVDs.  Nathan Fillion is great playing Castle!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a movie everyone should see. Ms. Danes did a marvelous job depicting Temple.<br />I highly recommend this movie. It is heart-warming and will increase your understanding of others.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|Castle is a great show - Everyone should get the DVDs of all the seasons of this show.  A must see!!
B005J0VPNC|5.0|Funny and interesting app, very good for taking unusual pictures. Adds a nice quirky touch to regular photos. Recommended to all.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This version of Dredd is like the evil step-brother of the Stallone version. Much more enjoyable this time around, no shtick or comedy needed.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|Get the sugar in the cup! It's a simple concept and well executed. Each level makes you think a little more. Well worth the money!
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I read the book, and it the movie was very close to the book. I liked the fact that they tried to mix in modern music to try to help let the audience understand how it was then!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|A quick read. Soooo good. Sooooo entertaining. Soooo sexy. Transports me into their lives, exciting, scarey, dark, and very possible. Great second book!
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|it was a great deal love the steelbook  that the movies come in  if you are a Mad Max fan definitely buy this item  sound and picture are great as well as the price  a very wise choice.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It delivers. Season six will not disappoint, and the viewing experience on amazon is excellent.<br /><br />Just make sure you move your cursor to the top of the screen or the bar at the bottom will not disappear throughout the entire episode!
B00004THAY|5.0|Delivered in perfect condition and timeously. No-one does the Blues better than Eric and the King. Such a cool album, What a combination.
0767919408|5.0|There is a saying to the effect that a good writer/storyteller will make the most prosaic topic entertaining - and that a bad one will make the most fascinating topic surpassingly dull and uninteresting. Bill Bryson is definitely one of the good ones, as a producer of readable popular history goes. The four months of the summer of 1927 does not, at first glance appear to have much else besides Charles Lindbergh's successful transatlantic airplane flight going for it, but Bill Bryson goes in for a joyous romp through the rich banquet that was on offer in events and personalities of that particular summer.<br /><br />And a surpassingly rich banquet it is; with personages and incidents once famous and now relatively obscure, adorned with incisive word-portraits of the dramatis personae. That summer encompassed the verdict in a titillating murder trial, the making of a classic air-war movie (directed by a man who had participated in WWI as an aviator), the woes of Prohibition, the character of President `Silent Cal' Coolidge who succeeded the mediocre but Presidential-appearing Harding, (in the words of the author, Harding \\"had charm but no brains, Coolidge had brains but little charm\\"), Henry Ford's attempt to build a company rubber plantation in South America, and the rise and fall of the KKK ... a magical season for Babe Ruth, and a season in celebrity hell for the preposterously wholesome Charles Lindbergh. Never was there a man so temperamentally unprepared for celebrity or who got less joy out of a nationwide barnstorming tour to the acclaim of thousands of fans. One Summer is all this and much, much more, relayed with Bryson's wry wit. I had an advanced readers edition, without acknowledgements, notes, bibliography or an index, but there are fifty blank pages set aside for them, which will add enormous interest to those seeking more information about events and people.
B000AMUU94|5.0|Delivered in perfect condition and timeously. Waited twenty years to get this album, memories of my youth. Shoooo wow man....<br />Such a cool album, What an artist.
B000FA675C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this book and was intrigued through out the entire read. This book also gave me a new incite into Christianity; it's good points and it contradictory bad points. I gave this book 5 stars because I found it entertaining and thought provoking.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Amazing book. Be careful though George R.R. Martin will kill everyone you love! George R.R. Martin does not use twitter because he killed all 140 characters!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Fun, easy to play, good time waster! Would definitely recommend and vote this as one of the best free games out there!
B001ER4CTI|3.0|Perhaps one of the re-interpretations more reliable for a comic book. Zack Snyder atina in translating the language of Frank Miller film the spectrum. Perhaps would require more special features this edition
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great way to get ideas for crafts, home improvements, etc. Even a good way to just pass time. This has helped me with household improvement ideas.
0857685848|5.0|A guide to great interpretations of prehistoric life, by an amount of talent around the world..this is a book that any lover of the history of life (and of course the dinosaurs) love in its entirety!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|By far the best PVP games I ever played!!!Absolutely Addictive and would love for the 5th game to come out...if it's in the future...GREAT GAME OVERALL!!!!
B005COO1X6|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The description of the situation ,characters and the storyline are great. You can´t imagine the final.
B00CPLGGWS|5.0|Works great  I Had no problem with the apu it runs game really good installing the apu was very easy
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I used to be a Swype die-hard,  downloading it on every device I took home.  Now I am officially converted to SwiftKey. The predictions are actually helpful, the Swype is clean,  and the stats are very interesting!
B00B2166BS|5.0|Like it,  but price for me... too much. But it works good, really fast charge for nexus 10 . .
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife has everything going for it. Some people complain about the weight of the knife but in my opinion it is almost a bonus. This is a survival knife, not a scout knife. It's good to know that if I am caught in a pinch this knife can work like a small hatchet or mini machete. Its TPE handle is comfortable and grippy. In a survival situation I know that I'll be able to put this knife through hell without having to worry about it breaking. The sheath is very high quality, and the pouch is an awesome add-on. I was able to fit quite a bit of handy gear in the pouch. This included: a full sized leatherman multitool, the Bear Gylls priorities of survival guide that came with his canteen, the Bear Grylls whistle, about two feet squared of foil, a small fishing kit, a small sewing kit (both homemade), about 20 feet or more of fishing line, a couple of band-aids, a couple of cotton balls, a small plastic bag, a small sharpener/flint, a small flashlight, and in the elastic around the pouch I hooked another folding knife with half serrations and a roll of duct tape. I almost took off a star because the blade steel is not stainless, which is less than ideal for survival situations, but the price and other pros far outweighed that. An overall robust and handy survival knife that hits almost every category you can throw at it.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|I've read this book many times since I was about 12 years old and now I'm 64 and I still feel the same when I read Jane.
B004SBQAN8|4.0|I like this movie, it was original thought out well done special effects and not to bad acting.  Classic story line thought it was well done.
B0076Q1I98|4.0|Interestingly, The Shop on Blossom Street is the first in the Blossom Street series and it deals with knitting. It also deals with a woman who is surviving cancer and striving with her life after her father's death. She gets a scare when the cancer may have come back and she finds out who is truly there for her. The development of her relationship with her sister's characters had a great impact on me. There are 4 women, thus four stories, with Lydia and her yarn shop (the tie that binds the stories together) at the center. Each woman has their own crisis and are very different from each other. Yet, they all become friends and learn to support and receive support from each other.<br /><br />It was awesome for a feel good story. It's a romance book, but not a bodice ripper. The women are complex, have issues, and you can see why they made the choices that landed them in the position. Somehow, I got into the lives of the 4 main characters. I look forward to reading the next book and learning more about these 4 women.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|This is just what I needed to store my Kindle Fire in and it is the correct color. Thanks lots!

B00BWRKVVS|5.0|Can't go wrong with two for one.  My kids love Disney animation and frankly so do I.  Very colorful.  Great
0060899220|5.0|I'm a big fan of Anthony Bourdain and everything he does in print and tv, so maybe I'm biased, but I really enjoyed this book. It's candid, detailed and engaging throughout. Great read for anyone regardless of whether you'rea culinary professional or not.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Well I already have the first movie so I had to get the second one.  I love these types of movies.
140006922X|5.0|Fascinating and logical interpretation of a very illogical book!<br />This is one of the first explanations of the New Testament that<br />I can understand!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I love these kinds of movies.  I also like Tom Cruise and Morgan Freedman.  Didn't know what to expect and I like that
B005C9YZIW|1.0|The original documentary on Discovery was fantastic.  This is not the original documentary but something called Planet Earth Diaries. But the outer packaging fails to differentiate between the two. Interesting maybe, but not something I would spend $40 on. But it's opened and I'm stuck with it.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I just went to see Boz Scaggs last week at the Royce Hall in LA and it was the first time I heard his new songs.  I liked it so I thought I'ld buy his new CD
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Great entertainment in 30 minutes, but it ended too soon! Wanted to continue without having to be interrupted by having to rate game.
B009IN3AOS|5.0|There is not one bad track on this entire album.  It's one of my favorite albums of the year.  I simply can't stop listening to it.  The only downfall is that it had to end.  :)  I look forward to their follow-up!
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|I've been eyeing this game since it came out and suddenly it's free! This is easily one of the funniest racing game on tablet. My only complaint is that multiplayer servers keep closing on me. Other than that this is a fun game.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I liked this book but it was not that funny like I don't get the purpose  of it it isn't Jeff Kinney's best book he ever wrote
B003F9E5D6|5.0|I've seen Invictus before and will see it again. This is a story of the tensions between blacks and whites as South<br />Africa began the process of dismantling the system of apartheid following Nelson Mandela's inauguration as president. The monumental task is told through the microcosm of the success of the national rugby team which had previously been perceived as representing only the white population and it's acceptance by the black community. The story is presented on personal, political, and national levels. This movie is excellent for children, teens, schools, adults... anyone.
0306812835|5.0|After [[ASIN:0691125481 The New Science of Strong Materials or Why You Don't Fall through the Floor]] (which you should read first for fullest enjoyment) Prof. J. E. Gordon does it again, this time with structures and not materials.<br />Again his style is very accessible, and quite entertaining too !
B000I9YWDO|3.0|This is a good movie for anyone feeling frustration with poorly organized bosses in an office. The production is low buget and low key. The writing could have been more biting and the characters could have had more depth.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read in a while. I may be purchasing a couple of them to give as gifts.
1594746036|4.0|This book gripped my imagination from the first page.  The story line and the work in with the photos was ingenious.  I look forward to sequels.  I feel this is a book thar can be read on many levels, adult and teen.  I sent a copy to my goddaughter, but her mother read it first and also loved it. ,
B000I9YWDO|3.0|should be a prime instant video, i don't like paying for older movies when i pay a whole bunch of money for a year prime membership, its outrageous to pay for them
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I love the combination of science and spirituality/theology. Lots of food for thought. Feels new age-y, though, so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not open to new ways of thinking or seeing the world in a non-mainstream way.
B0012TWRAO|5.0|This RAM mount fit perfectly on my Suzuki DR250 handle bar. It come in two different lent. I'm using the short one.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I am really into hidden objects games. This is really addicting . I just wish that I could ask for items from other users.
B00DLKXF3A|1.0|I can't believe this is what they put out....coming home is the only good song on the whole album.  Its good prob because you would swear its an iron maiden song.  Ugh so bland.  Is that a drum machine?  I know its impossible to replace the rev (rip) but.... The lyrics are ridiculous after they had albums with so much lyrical genius.  I guess rock's beethoven has lost the way.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|One of the films that leaves it viewers with hope and an positive twist in both our possible past and a hopeful future. One of the best performances by Jodie Foster I can remember.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I think this is one of the greatest albums of all time.....The complexity and the many changes are so genius.  I think there are 3 seconds of the whole album I don't like and its a filler noise (jet engine maybe?) between part1 and part 2 of the awesome \\"i won't see you tonight.\\"  wow...seriously listened 100 times over and never became bored the music is so rich and inventive.
B0065IBZI2|5.0|This is a difficult review for me to write. I have a very large library of music and am OCD and therefore feel compelled to try and categorise it... but that's my problem. Before this I'd always categorised Kate under \\"Progressive\\", as I have Dave Gilmour, Peter Gabriel, Yes et al... but this album is something of a different order. This album is deep beyond deep, without any commerciality. What I mean is that I sometimes still share my Pink Floyd, Camel or Focus albums with someone else (I still have a few sad, patient friends), but this one isn't for sharing at all. This is Kate beyond 'Kate'; it taps in to a far deeper-level, a hypnotic, meditational one... though one where you know that everything is safe and secure. I realise that this could sound like an absolute load of rubbish, but I'd challenge anyone to listen to this album on their own - may be watching the trees or landscape - and not be transported to a deeper place. I have to file this somewhere... so 'Sublime' is the only categorisation that I can come up with. Please don't call for the men in the white coats !
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It's fun when you win and get items. It's bad when you spend hundreds of credits and don't get a thing.
0525478817|5.0|My high school daughter just started reading this book for school.  She loves the book.  Great read.  She would highly recommend.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Defending Jacob is an unbelievable novel.  Emotions don't run true to form.  The police are blind to Jacob and his nearness to &#34;accidents.&#34;  According to TV portraits of the servants of the people today, there are ingenious ways to finds facts to convict criminals; these policemen in Defending Jacob are a little backward.  There is no defence for Jacob.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|EQ is easy. Basic. I use this app for all my music.. Well worth looking into,if your looking for improvement. This is the One
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It was easy to connect up, download the app and register my android phone as a controller. Once that's done, the YouTube app has a Chromecast icon at the screen top which becomes active when you have selected a video and started it playing (the Chromecast app is only for setup, so it's not running with YouTube app). The first time (each session) you have to wait for the video to actually start playing on your phone (pc, whatever) before clicking the icon on the YouTube screen, but succeeding videos in the same session automatically chromecast to the tv. In other words, when the first video finishes or you pause, etc, you can just use the YouTube app as normal and find another video to play, start it playing, then just watch on the tv. The phone and app are only in the loop when you decide to pause or whatever. Otherwise the Chromecast works directly thru the wi-fi.<br /><br />I'm not presently a Netflix subscriber and didn't start a free month just to see it play, but if the YouTube experience is an indication, it should work fine.<br /><br />The quality of the picture will depend on your broadband connection including how well your wi-fi works. I have DSL 8-10 mi from the rural phone center and wi-fi router that is very recent and uses two channels (different carrier frequencies) of wi-fi.<br /><br />Before getting the Chromecast I used Chrome and Firefox on my fast laptop to stream some YouTube and some Amazon movies and another device to send it from pc to tv. That method sometimes had some speed problems and pauses would occur now and then. I think it was dependent on the day and time (broadband competition) and probably going thru my pc and browser were slowing things. I haven't yet tried the Chromecast in the evening when the DSL usually gets busy. I'll update this review if it hiccups. So far it's very good.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|Makes all other calendars sync with no Problem ... Highlighted important things. Reminder feature.  A Plus.. Great little app for my Kindle.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|close up on Secretariat when racing, good emotional scenes and all around a good movie considering the year they were working with
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The beginning of this book was intriguing, heartbreaking, and setup a hope that never quite panned out...too many characters got in its way. I'm usually a fan of tapestry writing, but this one felt not fully fleshed out.
B001H1UQZU|5.0|Having heard of this movie as one of Hilary Swank's best, I was eager to see it.  It was very different than I had expected but was not totally disappointed in watching it.  I enjoyed the &#34;topic&#34; but was disappointed in the setting and characters it centered around.  It is about her cross sexual identity ---- which is interesting ---- but I don't know why it had to take place in a small town with characters who were so totally disfunctional.  I believe the focus of the movie could have been more emphasized if the other characters weren't so complicated themselves.  It is, however, based on a true story so I had to keep this in mind.  Definitely adult film.
B00BSTVEDE|4.0|music from the movie. the movie i love so wanted some vinyl for some ambient playings and vangelis sure delivers
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I bought the digital version through iTunes a couple weeks before the actual release date because I couldn't wait. This movie was better than the first by far. So much excitement and drama. It can be hard to make the nerds happy and make it a blockbuster but JJ finds a way again. They do a nice spin on the original by keeping it fresh but still sticking with some of the old stuff. If you liked the first one from 2009, you'll love this. I know some people want to compare to the original Star Trek II but that's not fair. You have to look at it as it's own entity. Benedict Cumberbatch did a remarkable job as the villain.
B00F35BV64|2.0|I just watched &#34;Star Trek into Darkness&#34;.  What a disappointment!  I didn't see the first movie, thank goodness, for this was certainly &#34;a trek into Darkness&#34;. The Star Trek I grew up with used diplomacy over violence.  The violent scenes in this movie took the beloved characters of Spock and Captain Kirk and destroyed every sense of self control and decency they had.  The only moment of real meaning was when Lenard Nimoy came on the screen.  It is evident that Chris Pine has no intent on preserving the thought provoking saga that has existed through the years.  So sad!
B00114RKT8|5.0|Very convicting. Great history lesson for my children.  Very inspiring for me.  Show poer of perserverance.  Would highly recommend it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Got this for the kids but I have been playing it more then them. Really good graphics. It  temple run but just the Iron man version.
0024181900|5.0|Strunk and White is not only the best, but almost the only resource one needs for understanding good English prose style. A timeless resource for the student and professor, the amateur and the professional writer.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I've seen this movie three times and enjoyed it more each time.  Three of my favorite actors, Theron, Southerland, and Statham, were right on the Mark (Wahlberg, that is).  The action was great, and the bad guy really got what he deserved in the end.
B00ET7ICEQ|5.0|I listened to the album and Sheryl's interview on XM radio.  After hearing that, I bought the album and I really enjoy it.  Great lyrics, lots of variety in the types of music.
B008QZ1ZYQ|5.0|An addictive game for in between. Currently I am hooked.the graphics are also nice. The sorry did with the idea.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This product was exactly what I needed, although I may be in a small niche because I write / edit exclusively with .rtf files (Rich Text Format). I tried Kingsoft, but that product says .rtf files are incompatible. The reason I use RTF is because it's compatible with Wordpad  (I don't need the power of Word).<br /><br />I'm using a Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with an Apple bluetooth keyboard. Thanks to OfficeSuite Pro 7, this device has completely replaced my laptop for writing.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, OfficeSuite is great for .rtf files. Also, it has internal access to Dropbox, where my files live. Of course, I need to be near WiFi for this to work, so I'll manually copy Dropbox files to the Kindle to write when I'm away from WiFi.<br /><br />Generally, the fit and finish of the product is good. It works well for all of my needs.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is because they didn't respond to a tech request. I asked them if it support .rtf before buying. No response! I took a chance and got lucky, but this company needs to improve.
1932100660|5.0|After reading this book I don't see how anyone would want to continue eating animal based products.  Dr. Campbell beats the reader over the head with facts based on statistically based data.  He goes on to explain what is wrong with several of America's systems which allows the public to be manipulated for the wealth of a select few!!  Best investment I've ever made.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I enjoyed the authors writing and found his historical research I interesting. I appreciated the emphasis on strength and diversity in training.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I have to say that this purchase was really something I didn't need.  I got advice on Amazon help from a very helpful person...I was having trouble downloading a book from the library so I bought this thinking that it was needed.  All books that I borrowed previously were downloaded wirelessly but for some reason I just had trouble that day and have never had an issue since..so I thought this was something I'd never use again...but I did decide to download some pictures on my Kindle Fire and it works perfectly...I'm glad I found another use for this cable.

B00BJNHACS|5.0|Fun game.  Good graphics and addictive.  not always the most challenging but always fun.  Good time filler. I play it a lot.

B004Z2TUGE|3.0|This was an entertaining movie.  It wasn't a big block buster but I did enjoy watching the whole thing.  You have to like SyFy to enjoy it though.

B00BSZZA3I|4.0|Awesome I am glad that I bought it. Especially as I work on the road and in office sometimes I can not have my volume on on my phone I can now see it ring easier. Equally as cool for watching various things on the phone.

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|The banter has zip, the effects are fun, the climactic battle is decently spectacular, and if the 3-D is mostly expendable, there are a few scenes where it adds a nice kick.
B009K0OL06|5.0|I missed some of the show, so there I am with the full season and I love it, I recommend.
B00E3VTR1K|4.0|I give this 4 stars. An absorbing, wonderful collection of short stories that takes you into an alternative time and place and yet, you think, the situations could so easily apply to our everyday lives - if it isn't happening already! The best part for me was the author's writing style - simple and elegant, it commands your attention easily and there is absolutely no need to read things twice or thrice to make sure you understood.<br /><br />Galactic Energies opens up with Rewind and I'm intrigued from the very beginning, wondering why the protagonist is so enchanted by the actress. From rags to riches combined with an extraordinary run of good luck, I follow the protagonist's progress over the years, how he and his partner, Alessio, apply their business acumen in the heart of Europe, coping and planning against corruption which is pretty much the angst of nearly all ordinary citizens living in Europe. The author relays the frustration of the people well and I found myself cheering on the protagonist. The ending was a surprise, albeit a good one, in form with the sci-fi theme. This was my favourite story from the entire collection and I would give it a 5.<br /><br />The Kingdom of Turlis started well and once again, Lucas Rossi has a wonderful, engaging style and I kept turning the pages to find out what would happen. The story wanders into the realms of fantasy and while interesting, it's also where the frustration begins because there is not enough background on the characters. I understand it is a short story and even though there is a conclusion, I felt unsatisfied. 4.<br /><br />Life in Prison was the most interesting, absorbing and frustrating story in this entire collection. At the end of this story, I felt robbed of any proper explanation as to why the main character ended up in prison. I felt the author should have taken the time to explain or given some clues, and the reasoning that a futuristic society could deny telling a person why they are in prison israther hard to swallow. True, there were obstacles in the way but, even at the end, some sort of explanation would have been nice. It left me very frustrated and because of this, my rating dropped to 3.<br /><br />Forms of Love was absorbing and it was amusing to read about the alien female attempting to seduce the hard, unshakable detective who had been chasing her throughout the galaxy for many years. I didn't like the ending however; I didn’t think it was necessary that the detective found it necessary to do what he did, particularly where there was another, easier solution that could have guaranteed a happy life for him. But that may be due to the title of the story - perhaps it was a form of love indeed. It just defied logic to me. 4<br /><br />Latrodactus Mactans was an excellent idea for a video game and oh boy, if someone could really create something like that, then I foresee major protests regarding animal, moral, and religious issues. 5 for ingenuity, but despite the cool idea, I found this the hardest to read. Also, I was also left a little confused at the ending and I'm not sure if it was deliberate. I get that the character got stuck in an endless loop caused by hackers but then it ended with two spiders approaching and I wondered ... who were the spiders? 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Arcot and the Queen was okay for me. While the writing is engaging and the story is not boring, it was the most normal one for me, despite it being about vampires. 3.5<br /><br />The Perfect Family is set in a futuristic society where robots have begun to replace men as the perfect husbands and fathers. However, there is a catch. What happens when perfection takes a hold of family life and what does it mean for the substituted sex? 5 stars.<br /><br />Maciste - when I think of what happened to poor Maciste, I get angry. A sad tale and not enough payback I think. But other readers may think otherwise and that Maciste was sufficiently rewarded. 4.5<br /><br />Clouded Emotions is another well written, absorbing story and a little longer than the usual short story I think. But that worked to its benefit and while the concept is not new, it had enough twists and turns to keep me guessing. It still had the kind of ending I didn't like though but not too bad. I can sort of imagine what happened to the characters so it wasn't a complete hanger. 4.5<br /><br />I've not yet looked at the interactive story but I plan to do that shortly. Overall, I really enjoyed Galactic Energies and it has been a while since I've come across a writer with a simple yet engaging style. Lucas Rossi could make a terrible story into a best selling novel just with his distinctive style. I would never say no to reading any of his work.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I couldn't wait to read this book after reading 50 Shades of Grey, but it was a bit of a let down. I got bored with the &#34;I love you - I love you more.&#34; and &#34;Don't ever leave me - I won't  ever leave you.&#34;  I reached a point where I was just skimming pages to get past the redundancy.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Interesting and moving from start to finish.  I knew of the Orphan Trains but hadn't heard much about the specific stories of the children.  Often I was moved to tears by the seeming hopelessness of their situations.  Given her rocky first years it was miraculous that Vivian was able to eventually live a happy life.
0345529057|5.0|I have only read the first book, and I am already hooked. Can't wait to get through them all!! Great purchase!
B00EEDJHXA|4.0|Nice logic game. Even gets a little frustrating at times, which I love. If it weren't too easy, I would remove it. Really enjoy playing. It's addictive.
B004HHKFIY|4.0|Very cute. Would have given five stars if the whole train part was wooden but part was plastic. My daughter loves them!
B000URDE2Y|5.0|One of the best albums of the seventies. Yeah album, something you millennial brats never experienced. Robin is a Strat master.
B004Q0R7FG|4.0|Very cute. Would have given five stars if the whole train part was wooden but part was plastic. My daughter loves them!
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Start watching from season one you will get hooked. One of my favorite shows of all time. Just start watching you will see.
B001E45XT4|3.0|Well, It was a pretty good headset.. Fit me very comfortably, could wear it for any number of hours and never feel any fatigue or pain.. Sound quality wasn't bad, Mic quality wasn't great, but it did it's job.. I'd rate it higher, but this is the 2nd Plantronics GameCom headset I've had and it broke in the exact same spot, in around the same amount of time.. I put gorilla tape on it when I noticed it starting to crack, which kept it going a few more months, but it finally gave way a week ago and the left side broke off.
B004F5GLJ0|5.0|Start with watching the first of the series and you will get hooked. One of my favorite movies of all time. Just start watching you will see.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I have played this game for months but the ads that have started to play every single time you switch screens is too much. The game itself is awesome and I loved playing it. I was even ok with the numerous in app purchases of pearls. I am going to have to stop playing because being bombarded by ads is ruining the fun.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Start watching from season one you will get hooked. One of my favorite shows of all time. Just start watching you will see.
B007WPM4P0|4.0|A good film, well acted, and decent script, combining romance and action.  The lead couple don't have quite the chemistry one might want, given the story line, but If you like WWI and English actors, you'll find this enjoyable.
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|Start with watching the first of the series and you will get hooked. One of my favorite movies of all time. Just start watching you will see.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|At last an app that's easy to use, works like it is supposed to....I'm keeping this one. I am a fan!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Tightly written murder mystery played out on a winding, whiplash road of dead ends and one-ways to the darkest places of humanity. Another Flynn book that I couldn't put down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was having some Downton withdraw so I decided to watch the last show in season 3.  Stopped it about 2 min. b4 the end, didn't want to live through that part again!  Being able to watch shows like this whenever I want makes having Amazon Prime worth it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love downloading books and reading them on this app.  It is very easy to use and adjust to what I need
B00C59AVCG|5.0|Great watch for the money.To me great watch period.<br />Large and for some maybe a little heavy.For me perfect. Once again it is different that I like.<br />I plan on buying its brother the silver with white face.
B008Q0D32S|1.0|Very boring from the beginning. I could not keep focused  for more than 15 minutes. Also did not like the looks of the lead characters. They were disgustingly dirty.
B000J2BRQU|4.0|Great car action with good lessons from Japanese culture.<br /><br />My favorite quote:<br />&#34; I have money, it's trust and character I need around me. You know, who you choose to be around you lets you know who you are. One car in exchange for knowing what a man's made of? That's a price I can live with.&#34;
B002QYSZBO|5.0|The movie was fast paced and had witty humor. Robert Downey Jr and Val Kilmer are great together. Very fun!
B005COO1X6|4.0|If  you enjoyed his earlier work: Carrie, Cujo, The Shinning, you'll love this.  It keeps your attention start to finish.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I love both Samurai vs Zombies 1 and 2. There isn't enough time in the day to play them both after work. Thanks for the challenge.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I liked the content of this book, although, I'm not sure that the continual references to movies and modern day antics were absolutely necessary all the time. I have tried two of the experiments in  this book which have had successful outcomes. It is a good philosophy on how to live in a positive frame of mind.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|A great kids movie.  I bought this for a little girls birthday present because my 29 year old daughter loved it so much when she was little.  Funny, suspenseful, will keep your attention to the very end.  I highly recommend it.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This is a drawing app that doesn't just draw lines, it creates beautiful swirls.  If you are patient, you can make some really beautiful drawings with it.  I suspect a really skilled artist could make something amazing.  It's a fun way to waste a few minutes and try your creative skills.
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|Great game, but MAKE SURE you actually end the game officially before you go back to the home screen. If not the game will continue to run, draining your battery.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This is a puzzle game where blocks fall from the top and you have to slide them left and right to fill in the rows.  You can move them before or after they fall.  At first I wondered if you could actually get better at it, and the answer is yes.  After a few weeks, you start to see things that weren't there before.  It does reach a level where it is just impossible to go any further, but I guess that's OK, because who wants to play forever?
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is as good as they come<br />I don't want to say 13 more words so I wont be writing any more reviews if you gotta tell me how many words I gotta use
B00CDY6HW6|4.0|I was wondering where all the Lemmings-like games for Android are.  This one is a decent start.  You can play just to get through the level, which is generally a moderate challenge, or you can play to get all the stars for the level, which is very challenging.  My only problem with this game is that the characters are so tiny, and you can't zoom in and out.  These are minor complaints in an otherwise good game, though, so if you liked Lemmings, you'll like this.
B0014JKJHK|5.0|These are excellent shoes to work in especially if you have problem with your feet and need them for comfort!
B00640UICA|4.0|Another creative puzzle game.  The idea is that there are these little guys with various numbers of hands that rotate around their bodies.  You have to arrange them so that every hand is holding another hand.  Simple rules, but it can become complicated.  My kids love it, and I think it is a fun game to fill those minutes between appointments.  Fun for the whole family.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book was so go I pulled an all nighter. I matter as well buy the third book & become lost for one final time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am so very happy with Pinterest on my new Kindle.  It is easy and fun to pin and just browse other peoples Pinterest Pages.  Nice to be able to use Pinterest when away from home, when travelling.  Navigating Pinterest works great!
B0000047CX|5.0|I had the LP many years ago and just recently heard The Girl From Ipanema and knew I had to find the CD.  This is a masterpiece and is great listening with a glass of wine.  What a way to relax!
B003U6BE8I|4.0|After reading the book first then watching the movie I actually think they did a great job with the movie. The characters fit their roles and it was interesting how they modernized the story for this time as well as in the History.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|We always look forward to the episodes of The Good Wife.  Maybe because we love Chris Noth and also are from Chicago, lol.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is perfection!!! I want to be an Author and I'm writing a zombie apocalypse story in there as well as a short story for a contest :D SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY GET THIS APP!!!!
1451648545|5.0|This book is so incredibly fascinating. I have only read a handful of biographies and this has been by far - the best.<br /><br />It is agreed that Steve Jobs was intense, a perfectionist, and an extremely difficult person to work with or for. However, he seemed to get more out of his employees and company than anyone ever has. Through his intensity and dedication this one man changed the world and touched millions of lives. He truly is a visionary and a genius even if he was a a butthole in the process. Love him or hate him he was a truly brilliant person who changed the way we currently live and revolutionized entire industries.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story. You don't need to be a techy, computer guru, or entreprenuer to appreciate this book. The writing is done well and the story flowed smoothly. If I have one complaint it is the use of the term \\"reality distortion field.\\"  After a while I'm thinking yes yes we get it... the distortion field... stop saying that please.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is great! It's just awesome, I have lots of things in there :) including checklists and stuff and they are kept safe
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|overall I thought the movie was good. the movie followed the book pretty well.<br />scene is the arena were action packed.
B000VZX8J4|5.0|It is Soundgarden...Badmotorfinger....enough said. Just an amazing album....I love this Genre of music...I came of age in this era of music....Thank God....
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Lots of twist. Kept you guessing until the very end. Good cast of charactors. I would reccommend seeing this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this app for the kids but it's so addictive I have trouble sharing with the kids!! Lol it's so much fun and I love trying to beat my high score and my husband's--  enjoy :)
B002PEP4SC|3.0|Well written with all the antics of most cop/crime stories. Makes for better reading when the lead detective is a woman.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|After spending quite a bit of time with this, I found out, because I have AT&T U-Verse, I had to pay them to get it to work or buy an extra router and hook that up. would like to have know ahead of time that it did't work with 2wire routers. Also, the help for troubleshooting would give me choices of 3 different error messages on set up, none of which was the error message displayed on the screen.
B008JFUN6E|3.0|This movie is beautifully shot with potential for a great, deeper storyline.  But it falls flat into the typical sci-fi action thriller.  Disappointing that the movie was not even 2 hours as I felt more history and storyline could have been developed.  Jodi Foster's character for sure was slighted on development.  So much potential wasted.  Rent do not buy!
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|Looking for help playing the game.  Opening and understanding this useless application was a waste of time.  Do not bother!
B00DDUIW18|5.0|I has all the content, you only need to read about how to get the additional donwloads, and start working.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is the best alarm clock ever. this is better than any non virtual clock I have ever owned. it wakes me up without irritating me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the relationship the Crawley's and the servants.  Both are caring and respectful of each other. Each episode brings a new problem or happy ending. Looking forward to seeing Season 4 on PBS.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|my main gripe with this movie is the idea that artwork and human emotion are resolutely tied together.  That sounds like an idea from some dusty old elitist who never leaves the cultural district of New York.  But if you can ignore that one ridiculous piece of the story it comes off pretty well.  The premise of the movie is that human kind decided to medicate itself into oblivion to bring about peace and finds that it's lost its soul.  Lots of story twists and well done violence, kung fu fighting and gun play.  The story line was well thought out once you get beyond the ignorant moral lesson they so badly attempted to make about the value of artwork.  Special note to Christian Bale.  His role in this movie was light years more demanding than some of his other recent stuff and he pulled it off like a champ.
B00EDF43MY|1.0|All the apps that are from amazon on my phone and tablets force me to log in every time I use it.  Why now?
B00000JZI9|5.0|I ordered for my dad and it arrived in excellent condition as described and he is very happy with it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This program reveals the very best in Human Nature and relationships.  They always end each episode on a positive nature, leaving me wanting to see what happens next.<br />It is a joy both my wife and I watch together.
B005F9TQ9C|5.0|He was in between new albums at the time, but Self Portrait showed a more relaxed Dylan, hanging in New York and Nashville and cutting such great tracks as The Mighty Quinn and I've Forgotten More.......
B005HEVIJQ|5.0|What can I say, I am a star trek fan -- of course I love this show!  Not as &#34;original&#34; as TNG, but still, great story lines and plots.
B00DJYJFH8|5.0|From the late 80's TRASH was the sonic return of Alice Cooper.  Poison was absolutely one of the finest songs from the era and made this an impeccable track from this awesome release.  Now back on vinyl, gatefold cover, lyrics, photos.....great sounding album from this legend.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|My Boyfriend absolutely loved it.. Thank you amazon. One happy Guy.  Please continue to make more great products with low prices.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Mike,Brian, Al, Bruce and Dave really rocked out last year.....Wouldn't Be Nice, Sloop John B, That's Why God Made The Radio are just brilliant....wish it would keep going on .....
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Super fun.  GREAT DETAILS. Love Big Fish Games. Interesting storyline. Graphics are so good my husband thought I was watching a movie!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is a great game but it did have a glitch at the beginning it didn't download but once it did it was awesome and now I play all a the time
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I've been a Holmes fan since forever. Problem is you can only read a mystery for the first time once. When I first saw this I thought it might be interesting only because it would be the famouse stories told in now a days ways. Which it is. But it's so much more! Best dialog, best stories, best character development, best actors and London as the back drop. Like i said, best stuff ever. If you don't like Sherlock - Congrats, your unique!
B005DOKL3E|5.0|This case fits my Kindle Fire perfectly.  It seems to have some padding which is good in case the tablet is dropped.
0765348780|3.0|So far I've read the first 2 books in the series and I'm working on the 3rd. And when I say \\"working\\", I mean it literally - I find these books exhausting to read. Here are a few reasons:<br />1) Every paragraph ends with someone's heart being \\"laden with sorrow\\", or some offhand remark \\"cutting him to the heart\\", or someone's head \\"bowing with grief\\" or some such. For heaven's sake, getting stabbed in the thigh with a knife makes \\"a sobbing sound\\".<br />2) The dialogue is really hard to follow. Characters keep making remarks that are obviously meant to express how they feel, or foreshadow something, or reference something in the past, or reveal part of their character, but it comes off as just really randomized and jarring. I'm sure if I had a PhD in psychology/sociology and spent hours flipping back and forth I'd be able to decode what's *actually* going on, but I don't have the energy or inclination to do so. Maybe I'm just socially inept.<br />3) As an engineer, I feel a strong need for magic to follow \\"rules\\". Here, magic is... well, magic. Overly mystical and without any suggestion that we'll learn more about 'how it works' in the future. In terms of sophistication of the magic system, I feel like I've been tossed into the dark ages.<br /><br />I'm told that the books \\"make more sense\\" later, but so far I see none of it. I like some of the characters, and I suppose it's possible for things to evolve into something more systematic/well developed in the later books (a la Wheel of Time), but so far I'm 2000 pages in and still haven't worked up any enthusiasm.<br /><br />I will make this concession: If you happen to read and enjoy Guy Gavriel Kay's books, this is essentially that with more magic.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Very well written, very informative, very clear book. A good place to start if you are new to social media marketing. It also has great tips for those who are familiar with it. The clear structure of the book is easy to follow. Each chapter has a list of action items with direct suggestion of what needs to be done to follow the chapter's general advice. I will definitely reread its parts and follow the suggestions in my work.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great movie for the family, the classroom, anyone anywhere!  I am currently using it as my Senior English class has been reading various narratives, writing theirs, and are now watching a narrative in a third form of media.  I use as many examples as I can to show them great narrative writing, which in turn helps them create their own.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|It has a very interesting twist.  The acting was not stellar but lent credibility to the story.  Would watch it again!
B0009RCPY8|5.0|My husband absolutely loves Ghost Busters. So when I saw that I could get both movies on the cheap. Can't explain how happy I was.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series - have bought all three - but the thrill was having streaming video included - have watched them on my big screen computer---:)
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is the best, and her book doesn't dissapoint.<br /><br />Bossypants is full of funny little stories about Tina's upbringing, career, and family life.  An easy read, and so funny it literally makes you laugh out loud. My husband banned me from reading it in bed since my laughter woke him up more than once.  It became my reading material for my commute to work and it made the disgusting Metro ride much more enjoyable for the week.<br /><br />Her musings about motherhood really made me admire Tina Fey in a whole new way.  This was a great book!
B000S1M9LY|2.0|Hardest book of contemporary fiction I've read.  Still struggling through it.  Hints of genius or great reward.  What's certain is the investment it'll take to find out.  Switched back to GOT for light and easy break from this...
6305128952|5.0|The quality was very good, DVD had no scratches and played well. The story differs from the book, but that was OK.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|I am so sad to write a review like this.  MDNA was an AMAZING show and I was so excited to get my BD.  But the picture quality is hopelessly flawed and must be rectified.  There is clearly and error in the production of the BD around the world.  This much be fixed ASAP.  I am now on my second defective copy from Amazon.  There are tons of reviews that discuss this issue yet it seems Amazon isn't doing anything about it except exchanging defective discs with other defective discs.  Huge disappointment.
B0000T70K4|3.0|I think the easiest way to read this novel is to see its central chracter, Eric Packer, as the personification of capitalism -- or 'market forces', anyway, since Packer seems to be a currency manipulator who doesn't make anything or provide any sort of useful service.  Not a representative capitalist, then, but a figure representing the relentless appetite (in which there is no goal beyond satisfying the appetite -- a wish, a desire, even a whim -- and nothing determining the goal beyond the drive to link 'I want' with 'I have'), the inhuman, virus-like amorality and the inevitable self-destructiveness of the capitalist force itself.  I'd have to read it through a second time in order to decide whether that is really right, and I'm not sure I ever will read it again.  There's a deliciously arid, spare, desert-scape quality to the prose that recalls some of the earlier short novels (\\"The Names\\" stands out in my memory), and there's a nice tension between that and the chaotic jumble and disorder of the city. \\"Cosmopolis\\" offers many wonderfully bizarre, funny, disturbing, occasionally beautiful touches, as you would expect if you know DeLillo's work -- including a very deft evocation of Ebenezer Scrooge, the iconic evil capitalist, and an equally clever way of illustrating the idea that capitalism contains, *within itself*, the seeds of its own destruction.  But there's not enough, overall, to make me really curious about whether I've got it right or not.
B000OLRH10|5.0|An excellent rendition to help people understand the psychology behind all parties involved/effected by the diamond industry & it's ugly secrets.
B008IBP24C|5.0|What a wonderful insight into the lives of the rich in England during the early part of the 20th century!  I am hooked! Love this show!
0307591549|5.0|Great advise for not only improving team performance and moral, but.. In a nutshell, I was sad, and this worked better than any perscription! Loved it, found it fun and easy to read! HIGHLY recoomend!
B00CEK9OTM|4.0|I would enjoy this game a lot more if there was a calibration setting that can let me play it at any angle I want instead of just face up. Other than that it's a great game.
B002KEDQJQ|5.0|I actually haven't watched the director's cut yet, but Watchmen is one of the most poignant movies about American Society, human nature, and the powers that be that I have seen.  It's also extremely stylistic and fairly action filled for those who don't want to think much while watching a movie.
B0012QRPU4|4.0|breaking bad came recommended to me from a friend that has prime amazon. I have only watch the pilot  so far and would recommended.
B00EY8A6BC|2.0|Not a complete waste of time... but not a very good movie. Pretty predictable plot line, and not much excitement.
B00C5R8364|5.0|This newest by Forsyth grabs you right away. Excellent writing . Too good to put down. Get it as fast as you can..
B008BU75IQ|4.0|There was a brief period of time when I became disillusioned and thought the book was going nowhere.  Glad I stuck with it.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|The book highlights with scientific research the extent that all human beings become what we have trained ourselves to become.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Bought this for my adult son. He says the surround sound is great, but complains that the battery ruins out quickly.
B0035JNTA6|5.0|What is there to say? It's a classic and if you haven't seen it then watch it and you probably won't be disappointed, unless you don't have a very good sense of humor  : )
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Superb writing! As always, he keeps you engaged and interested. I'm always on the lookout for his most recent book.This was a great read.
B00915G6MG|5.0|I missed most of Season 10 because of being in a homeless shelter.  Getting to watch all the episodes one after the other made the season that much better.  The special features were better than ever-especially Tony's apartment.  I can't wait for season 11!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I would highly recommend Downtown Abbey! It's well written, very engaging and has an awesome cast. Also, it's been very interesting learning about the class and culture of that time era.<br /><br />I can't get enough!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read.  Enjoyed the ending.  Can't wait to see its portrayal on the big screen.  Looking forward to Hunger games 2!!!
B0083GBMFU|4.0|Kravitz for king!  This is a full body album.  Very happy with it.  Wish he'd come out with a knew album soon.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This game is addictive and fun. It's tempting not to spend money but it's easy to play without. Over all its good
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have been playing this game for a while now on my Kindle Fire HD and I Love it!  Get it, you won't be sorry! The graphics are superb for a free game  and I haven't experienced any crashes!
B00A757EFW|3.0|It's a little too slow paced for me, but I've always liked Pac Man.  Played it on TV years ago.
B003O86FMW|3.0|The end makes you need to read the next book.  I gave it 3 stars because, I felt as cheated as katniss.
B005HEDL8M|5.0|The episodes transfered well to DVD. The sound and images are clear and no obvious changes were made to anything.
B004EPZ06G|4.0|This is a very funny movie.  I got this for my son for his birthday.  It is great fun to watch.
B00E5Q1LTY|1.0|I really don't think that a starship case scene is anything worth watching. Not funny. Not engaging. Not worth the money for the electrons. Please do not waste yours and perpetuate these Hollywood cartoons.
B008K7WCJM|5.0|This album changed me.  This album is unlike no other.  The cover mentioned that it was \\"oblivion through sound,\\" which is by no means inaccurate.  Whether you can withstand two hours of this blinding, mesmerizing, elaborately enveloping devilishness is up to you, but even if you consider yourself musically adventurous, be very, very ready.  This was all I would allow myself to listen to for at least two weeks, as I knew its influence would be unmatched for the rest of my musically exploratory life.  Every one of my roots were shaken to their raw, dark, cores and lifted to a state of being that nothing else has brought me to.  If you are willing to let this album take you in, it may be all too rewarding.  If you are not, then don't even spend the money.  This is not entirely safe stuff to expose yourself to.  It is beyond all else.  Again, if you buy it, do not brace yourself, but be ready for an all-consuming cherishing of the darker side of every one of us.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Great app for file management, as long as you can figure out how to do what you need it to do.
0307352153|5.0|I used to try and hide my introvertness and pretend to be an extrovert, but this book really opened my eyes to how being an introvert is not a &#34;condition&#34; but a great way to live.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|a nice twist on a dystopian future theme.  liked the way the story folds into itself and resolves at the end.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Interesting plot, intriguing enough that I want to read another book in the series.  It was a pretty good book.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|Did not come with a remote control as stated and could not pair it with my hearing aids which are blue tooth capable and which work with my phone so I know problem was not with the hearing aids.
0062218867|5.0|This book is like Terry Pratchett in his prime.  He has been my favorite laugh-out-loud author.  Vimes is a great character.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I've seen and tried other apps that calculates and this one is simple and straight forward. Worth the time to try it out.
0684857219|4.0|I wouldn't use this as my only source for programming ideas and some of the nutritional / supporting info is a little outdated. But you can't argue with results, Arnold knows how to work your muscles and this book is very thorough in presenting his knowledge.<br /><br />Tons of pictures and good descriptions.
B00006RAKP|5.0|I am really getting to appreciate Elton John, I did not lesson to his music years ago.  Now Elton has brought back the past to me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is awesome and I read it really fast, can't wait to read the sequel. I want to read it before the movie comes out
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Action packed, Scarlett J rocks.  Iron Man, Thor and Hulk have great chemistry.....sort of? Would like to see more marvel comic books come to the big screen.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|It's a big beauty watch attract lots of eyes<br />I love it<br />The big size of it surprised me but after 1 week I just couldn't take my eyes of it....<br />:-)
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows on TV.  I love the acting and the storyline.  The writers are fantastic and so are the characters.  I never know what is going to happen next and look forward to each week's surprise.  Great GREAT series.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app it helps me wake up in the morning, know the temperature outside, and adjust the brightness just by touching the screen up for bright and down for low.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I really enjoyed it. A lot of times its hard to find a movie that my husband and I will both enjoy. I like comedies and he loves action. This movie has both. It was a lot of fun and I would watch Red II which came out recently.
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|The movie was good , but it left you hanging as not being complete. The scenery was good and the color
B00000JZC4|5.0|Missed this when it was released. Backfilled my library and am very happy with it. Already listened to it through seven times.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I really thought that if I played the weekly goals, and when I surpassed the top 1000....I'd get coins....but I thought wrong.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those books that you can't put down except to sleep. I look forward to more silo related stories.
B00D0Z2JR4|1.0|I watch allot of anime subbed but I still can't understand and read it same thing with the new OP film if its in Japanese and has Japanese subtitle then I CAN'T buy it because I wont be able to watch it. The only reason I give it such a bad star rating is because someone like me who's not bilingual wont be able to watch it.
030789701X|5.0|This guide is amazingly thorough! It has everything you need. You will endlessly refer to it. Very well put together.
B00EQ0CKRQ|4.0|I like this game a lot it's free and its really cool awesome graphics sound and feel. The only thing that I don't like is that you don't get a lot of money win you win a race
B00336HOU2|1.0|Possibly the worst movie my family has ever watched.<br />Confusing storyline, disjointed plot.  The movie was ridiculous and didn't make sense.<br />My husband said it was a waste of two hours, I fell asleep and my kids were completely confused throughout the movie.<br />We all wished we didn't waste out time watching it.  The best part is the first 15 minutes of the movie when a family receives 'the box' at their doorstep.  After that, it is a mess of a movie.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|great movie and Johnnie Depp was awsum as barnaby Collins  wife and i se to watch the original show on tv  would reccomend this to family and friends
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I really enjoy this app it works really well I can fall asleep soundly and it wakes you up with soothing sounds good job
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Clever writing. Interesting plot with added mystery. Mixes &#34;traditional&#34;  and modern. Relatable characters. So different from run of the mill novels.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I really liked the first movie more than this but this is great too with the continued character development as well reintroducing new iterations of familiar characters within the Star Trek universe.  A recommended watch, and not just for Trekkies but for regular movie watchers as well.
B009IF6YRQ|4.0|If you like Will Ferrel and a good laugh - it was a good movie.  I didn't really get the whole &#34;having to set up a fraternity&#34; thing when they're not even a student - but it didn't make it any less funny...
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This app is fun but hard almost all the levels are hard and fun there are bosses and gangs with lizards!!!!!! Best app ever you will like this app
B00000251N|5.0|if your a Neil Diamond fan it's a must have - if you haven't seen Jonathan Livingston Seagull you must see it...
B003O86FMW|5.0|People can say what they want but this is nothing more but a good book that keeps you on edge
B00ESY77LO|2.0|This movie made no sense.  It assumes you know the plot of the book and it's shot like the director is on hard drugs.  What is up with the ghetto music interspersed throughout too?  No character development either...I felt like I was watching a really long music video.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Loving pocket editor I got all diamond stuff thanks Mojang I have<br />The Xbox edition it's awesome best company ever
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Pathos, poignancy, laugh-out-loud belly laughs, tears, amazing character development, it's all here. Truly great film, no wonder it got the Oscars/noms it did !
1452105111|4.0|I think that this was the perfect addition to my son's first birthday party. It looked great across the tables.
B0026IUXO2|5.0|Truly wonderful film, gorgeous costuming, historical accuracy, shows what really went on in Elizabeth's lifetime, just wish there'd been a sequel! Highly recommended for a cold night with a good glass of red and excellent company~
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Product downloaded immediately and was really interesting.  I have been able to start loosing again as this diet plan really works, albeit hard on the fast days, it still gets the rest of my digestive system finally working towards the right direction  Thankful for the seller and having the opportunity to buy from Amazon.<br />Fred Pauer<br />Augusta Ga
B009GEFXLC|5.0|My husband and I love the drama of Castle great acting and we are not completed yet but very happy with the video
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|Great for a long lasting experience. Fun boards that change each time and your not just playing the same level each time
B000FBJF78|5.0|All McCall's books are good. This whole series is a delight. You will want to get the PBS series once you have read one. I can't give it higher marks.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I know how the game works, but it's still super entertaining to play, especially while bored or with boring people.
B004L3AQLU|4.0|Jake and Anne perfect together. Fun, sexy, charming... Sentimental without being cloying. I will watch it again when I get depressed.
B0058VW36U|3.0|Not entertaining enough to keep my attention more than a few minutes, but I see the appeal of this game.
B00873GRU4|3.0|I only found it to be an average read. I actually chose it for an August reading challenge. And most of the time it felt like a challenge just to keep going. The characters were so-so and I never really felt that attached to them. I did however love the idea of the silo. Overall I wasn't really moved by the story and probably won't be reading the rest of the set.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I enjoy swiping instead of typing, but the detection in this is lacking and the stock keyboard on my Galaxy S3 works much better than this.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|The Eagles has always been my favorite musical group.  Over the years I have the band and the members individual careers.  I saw the documentary on TV and I knew I wantd a copy for myself.  As far as the CD content goes...same beautiful music I have loved since the beginning.  I am very satisfied.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It took me a while to get through this, and as with most multiple perspective books, I found certain characters' parts more interesting than others. I'm glad I stuck with it though - ended up being one of my faves from 2013.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Saw the presentation on TV and knew I had to have my own copy.  Both of my sons know that I have followed the Eagles since the beginning.  My favorite gift this birthday was the DVD and CD.  I plan to watch it with both my sons.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love that this book brought out many differing opinions at my book club meeting. Great for discussion. I couldn't put it down.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Great album and even better sound quality. For convenience, a link and serial number to download the digital version is included.
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|Incredible suspense with an unsuspected ending. Great movie with a lot of action.<br />Amazing cast and a decent screenplay makes this movie very enjoyable and entertained.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|makes me LOL, great pass time. Love Despicable Me: Minion Rush.  I want to get it for my Grandsons for Christmas.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Awesome little sharpener. I keep it in a pouch that is attached to my sheath so it's always around when I need it. Love it! Brings knives back to life. I use it on my camping knives, kitchen knives, scissors, everything!
B00275EHJG|2.0|My son loves this movie, but it skips way more than expected. I understand I bought a used DVD, but it should be in working order.
B003UBTX72|5.0|I enjoyed reading the tales of the band that I grew up with.  Keith is really something and fantastic insights into the band and his life experiences. Didn't realize all the musicians that he has collaborated with, want to get some of these albums! Also am going to try his bangers and mash recipe!  Keith is really amazing, beautiful family and still standing!
B0098460O4|4.0|I thought they would sound as good or even better than on t.v., so I was disappointed. i have heard them in concert and they are great, I expected to hear the same on the cd.
B005544TRQ|5.0|No idea where this gem of a series was hidden, but I never heard about it until my sister told me it's one of her favorites.  Thank you Amazon Prime for making this available for free!  I loved the series, got quickly hooked, and am now making my way thru all the episodes of each season.  Love it!
B00915G6MG|5.0|NCIS has always been my favorite show since the very beginning. Mark Harmon and the rest of the cast are very good. These agents are excellent at what do in order to catch the bad guys.
B000BYCAJE|2.0|The rating is for the sound in standard definition, not the five star music. There is too much bass, especially on Suite:Judy Blue Eyes.Bernie Grundman really screwed this one up.
B00915G6NK|4.0|This show is one of my favorites on Tuesday nights. Chris O'Donnell and LL Cool J are both excellent actors. The rest of the cast is very good too. What I like about this show is that they always get the bad guys.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|I kept getting a static noise on my app when I started a sleep timer. It's not my Kindle that's wrong. All it must be the app.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|At times the book was a little too slow, but it was a nice change of pace.  It was well written.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Love this movie I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it and it keeps my 3 year old son happy and entertained
0761536434|5.0|This book is amazing and I still have it.  It is very thorough and concise.  I really love how they start explaining the history seriously back in the early 20th century.  The only complaint I have is that it stops pre PS2, XBOX, and GAMECUBE.  Of course that can be avoided I suppose. But I must know more! More input, more input!
B002VRZEYM|5.0|If you live in the US and you eat, you must see this eye-opening documentary about what really goes on behind the scenes in today's food and meat processing industries. The film reveals how today's farmer is nothing more than a pawn under the thumb of powerful corporations and governmental dictates. Even more disturbing, you will learn who occupy the highest level government positions that control the agricultural industry. If there was any good news, it is the fact that the American consumer can vote for change in the shopping aisles buy making informed decisions about what they will put on their table and what they will not. Highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is great!  Fun way to occupy time. while waiting. Too many ads.  But it is fee so have to pay to play and ads aren't too bad.
0307352153|5.0|I am hopeful this book starts the pendulum swinging back to end the insanity of overly open office space designs and the valuing true diversity found in introverts and extroverts. Nicely written and researched.  Well worth the read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've had this app for a long, long time.  I play solitaire with it every day!  It is one of my favorite games - along with Bejeweled.<br />It's not action, but a great escape from the everyday grind.
B002O2THVA|5.0|I watched this film because director, actor and scholar Peter Bogdanovich considers this to be among John Ford's best.  It contains a strong undercurrent of the force of U.S. history, and the conflict between rugged individualism vs. government and community order.  Ultimately, it is a love story, but unfolds unexpectedly. This film is a national treasure, featuring great performances by American icons Jimmy Stewart and John Wayne.
B00COGZ8FU|3.0|The story line was good but a couple of scenes didn't make sense...  Not as action packed as I was expecting.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Richard Castle and Kate Becket at their best. I bought the dvd for the extras and I was not disappointed.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This is a most amazing app to use to identify and then buy a song, if you desire it.  It is quick and accurate.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is such a AWESOME game, it is really addictive. Very kid friendly game also, keeps them busy on a road trip.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|At first I didn't understand the game. Then my wife told me to fix the horse picture,from there I started getting the concept and went thru three rooms in a couple of minutes.REALLY IS FUN!
B000GCFBQU|4.0|Not my favorite Strout novel as the content has too much religion in it for my taste.  I wish the main character had been more assertive
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|This film, directed by David Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters) tells the story of a small, not glitzy recording studio at which some of the most famous rock legends put their music on tape. It is also the story of the Neve sound board itself, which Grohl purchased when Sound City was forced to close down with the advent of digital recording. Cameos include Tom Petty, Lindsey Buckingham, Stevie Nicks, Neil Young and members of the bands, REO Speedwagon, Fear,and Rick Springfield, whose connection to the studio is profound.
B0081JFGQU|5.0|This is a band that excels in live concert experiences. Susan's pipes revert to her pre-mom days with snarls, groans and whispers like only she can do. Papa Trucks seems to come out of his shell here, and he beats on that slide guitar like it was a $3 whore. Modern Blues Classic may sound like an oxymoron, but that's what you got here. folks. Thank goodness these two got together and birthed this album.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Cute,fun,and the grandkids and their parents loved it.It was a great hit on movie night with the neighborhood kids laughter and dancing,it was an  awesome night.
B00533CLE2|5.0|Susan broke my heart when she became Mrs. Trucks, but the flip side of the coin has been the emergence of the Tedeschi Trucks Band. A match made in heaven in my book. There's some great song writing here, excellent musicianship, and some top quality production. If you are looking for some good old blues to rekindle your spirit, check out Revelator. It'll drive you home.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome game for children and adults....but wish there were more levels / different scenes in this game...but my daughter and I love it
B007SUW24W|5.0|All the songs are great.  Buy....Listen...Enjoy....Small Bump is may favorite since I have a lot of friends having babies right now.  So quirky but easy to listen to.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I feel sorry for you guys who aren't interested in this game lol. This is like temple run and subway surfers all over again. You won't regret playing this game. :)
0062255657|1.0|Bought it for my husband because he wanted to read it very badly and tossed it aside after the first 2 chapters and commented it was too weird for his taste.  I have not read it so not sure.  Some may like it.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|When it first came out first I did not know if wanted it so than I just  got it now I'm a pro at iron man 3
1476719071|5.0|I bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loved it.  She wants additional books in this series if there are any.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The book was a little slow in the beginning but quickly picked up, giving a fairly accurate portrayal of issues that quadriplegics face with the loss of meaningful employment, independence, major family shifts, & developing new relationships.  I was held in hopes of a happy ending but even that is relative.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|excellent product, very handy sharpener for when your on the go,it is built out of hard plastic and is very rigid i well use this for years to come......
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book captured my interest right from the start. However, I gave it 4 stars because some of it didn't seem believable.  I know there are a lot of people blind to their children's faults, but this was so obvious that his dad should not be on the case. I still found it to be very interesting and the end was quite unexpected.  Brings up a lot of issues about our family values.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It was a good movie. It was entertaining just very predictable. I saw the twist at the end coming from almost the beginning.
B008MM9630|4.0|I would like it better if there was no energy bar and you could just continue playing. Other then that I like the game.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I'm glad to have another Star Trek movie out. I'm a fan, no doubt. This movie doesn't reach the level of greatness but it is another nice addition to my home collection.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|this is a great star trek movie, wish they could come out with the series on tv like the first star trek with shatner
B008JFUO36|4.0|This is a fairly decent movie. Not great by any means but a good addition to the collection. I'm a sci-fi fan so I liked it.
B000SEGTI0|4.0|In a world of artificial feelings, things and hopes, Rick Deckard tries to find a meaning to what he does: retiring (killing) androids.<br /><br />This is a great story, full of insight and longing, interesting view on human loneliness and artificial substitutes, written long before Facebook and it's idea of what &#34;friends&#34; mean, it will get you thinking about where we're heading as humans.<br /><br />&#34;Blade Runner&#34; is one of my favorite movies, but it only resembles the book on the character's names. This is a deeper story, in a sadder tone, with complex characters and set in a lonely, dry and decadent San Francisco, not L.A. So it will be a whole new experience for you.
B000SC245E|4.0|Thought I was going to have to call the repair company, but it came with instructions for replacement.  Took all of 5 minutes to get my printer up and going again.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|This certainly doesn't give you information on all the levels.  At least it was free but still wasn't worth the time to download it.
B001P3SA94|2.0|I wanted to see this movie again however it is dark and blurry<br /><br />Not a quality tape at all<br />and I was so disappointed
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Those Swedes sure can spin a tale. Book has it all: humor,mystery and quite a bit of history. Author weaves quite an interesting story using fiction and historical characters. Really enjoyed it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Very convenient and easy to use.  It's easy to navigate through the different pages or selling, sold, payments, et cetera.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|If you love geeks, video games, and the 80's this is an absolute must read tale. It is well written, well edited and worth your money. Read it!
0345529057|5.0|You will start the first book, and suddenly lose hours and days while obsessively reading this series.  Loved ones and work and other life activities will fail to capture your attention - as you will be lost in the world of Westeros until the end of book 5 at which point you will lament the fact that book 6 is not yet published.<br /><br />Seriously though, I am not a fantasy fiction person - and I LOVED this series - way before I knew of the HBO show.  :)
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Just the right amount of tension (intelectual & emotional)  between Holmes & Watson.  So far, very decent crime puzzles to boot!
0143119680|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and could barely put it down.  It really takes you through the rabbit hole of mysticism.  Recommended.  :)
B00F35BV64|5.0|Love this movie.  The correlation with the older movies is impeccable and the new cast is superb. Lots of action, yet great storyline.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I purchased this CD as a gift for my mom on her birthday and she really enjoys it.  Buble always delivers.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Tesla is not widely known.  This was very informative.  He had dealings with famous people, but isn't that well known himself.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|adele is amazing.  what more is there to say really?  she's young, beautiful and talented.  I love this CD so much.
B00CLIJ9A6|3.0|I thought this film would be more charming and funny....not planning to watch it again.  If you are looking for light comedy, buy something else!
0385504225|3.0|Not nearly as good as his earlier books.  Don't waste your money - if you MUST read - get it from the library.  Trust me, it can wait and does NOT need to be a part of your personal library.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I must say that I am a minecraft and mojang member but I love survival but creative sucks I mean you don't get a pick axe only a hoe and a sword other blocks are chosen by the game ok I'm not trying to make minecraft look bad I love it but please put every thing that's in survival in creative I am an awesomely good at minecraft pe and pc edition ps buy but please add items to creative thank you if you are reading this ok goodbye and have a great rest of the day
1250030951|5.0|My name is Heather and I am a huge Rainbow Rowell fan. One could say I am a fangirl for her books. I loved Attachments, I wanted to be friends with Eleanor and Park and read comics with them, and I want to hang out with Cather and Levi and read her fanfiction. Rainbow has a way of not only bring characters to life but making them feel so real that you miss them when their story is over. I loved every little thing about this book. I remember the great Facebook debate over the name Cath. I was not a fan of the name and I was a little sad when Rainbow said she was going to use it in her next book. However, it totally works. Cath/Cather (I like the nickname) is a great diverse character with flaws that make you like her even more. I love Levi and his overly nice personality. I also like how he is slightly less than perfect. It is very refreshing to read about a couple who has physical flaws. The only issue I had with this novel is that it ended. I thought I had a few pages left and then I turned the page and was face to face with the acknowledgments page. Very sad...<br /><br />So here is just a list of my favorite things... (Because I like list)<br /><br />1. The word \\"rapey\\" I laughed and then read the passage to three different people<br />2. The similarities between Simon and Harry. I keep thinking of a gay Harry with Malfoy.<br />3. The scene with The Outsiders. Every single word...<br />4. Reagan.<br />5. Reagan and Cath people watching while they eat. Super fun!<br />6. Cath reading her fanfiction to Levi. It was just so sweet<br />7. Levi's manners, I know I already said this but he is so sweet.<br />8. The way Cath dresses.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Riggs wrote with such conviction that I am left wondering if this is truly a book of fiction.  Within the first chapter of the book I was drawn away from it's pages and directly into a fabulous world spun by imagination.

B009HOU672|5.0|I found this recompose from one of the forums regarding the best version of four seasons. I listened to the preview here. Not very impressive at the time because I am very used to the traditional way of performance of Four Seasons. But I still decided to give it a try. You have to listen to the full CD to be able to enjoy it. I fall in love with this CD immediately after finished listening the CD. Yes, it is different with the traditional performance, but in a very great way. You will not regret buying this CD. Strongly recommend to Vivaldi fans.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Its good. does what's promised. Amazon says I need more words, so, &#34;Do not let the hero in your soul parish, in lonely frustration, for the life you deserved but never have been able to reach. Check your road and the nature of your battle. The world you desired can be won. It exists, it is real, it is possible, it is yours.&#34;

B0040I09RM|5.0|great show and the cast is really good. The plot and setting is really great in this series on fx.
B005JZBPHS|4.0|It came on time, it looked so great and the package It came in was OK. The two problems I had was the disc would be easily scratched in its casing and SOME OF THE DISC SKIP! Its not terrible but some of the episodes in season 3 to 6 six skip towards the end where you can finish the episode. Its not a deal breaker because the series is cheap here so its worth the price, but if you don't want them to skip your best bet is going to the store.
0399159347|5.0|I super enjoyed this book. I managed to finish it in 24 hours, mostly because I was very curious to know what would happen next. *Minor Spoilers* The story followed three different women whose lives were destined to collide. Cecilia and Rachel in a fairly obvious way and Tess in a more tangential manner that I found to be particularly clever. I figured out where it was going fairly fast (it was hardly a big secret once you were fully introduced to all characters), but the more sinister angle that things took was not as clear to me until I realized what a short time frame the book occurs in. I found the characters to be incredibly well drawn and very realistic. The storylines were weaved together beautifully. I especially loved the epilogue. It definitely makes you think and I imagine it would be a good book for a book club. It blurs the lines between right and wrong, and really pushes you to imagine what type of behavior is justified and under what circumstances. When is the unforgiveable forgivable? I can't wait to read some of the author's other books! I would definitely recommend this book for an engaging book that is slightly off the beaten path.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awsome i loved the graphics and the stagez especially the beach dispicable me minion rush is an amazing game
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This is the story of a young boy with a deformity and what he went through growing up in a public school.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Like all Summer popcorn movies, this movie's is short on plot, but heavy on action. Much better than the Stallone version a few years back and much closer to the comic. The action and effects are top notch! Should have done better than it did at the box office.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|I did not have the highest expectations for this book. I know that may make me sounds dreadful, but I'm really just not a big fan of mystery novels, or \\"clean\\" books.  I am an erotic junkie, and the books that usually appeal to me are rough around the edges and contain quite a bit of profanity, sex, etc. That being said though, I LOVED THIS BOOK. I don't think there was any sex or profanity, and yet I never missed it once. It was such a fun read! It had a quirky cuteness unlike anything I've read in the past. Often times I come across \\"cleaner\\" books, and they just seem lame, overly predictable etc. Not this one! This book had me laughing so hard. The humor and whit were one of a kind! The personalities portrayed in this read were so loveable and relatable and the character developement was off the charts.  I can't wait to read more in this series. I also, very much appreciate, this not ending on a cliffhanger! Well done Ms. Swank. This book had it all!
B00985E3UG|5.0|I really liked this book.  It's informative and opens your eyes to the practices of the large food processing companies.<br />It helped me understand why the US has an obesity problem.

B0082RHRHC|5.0|I find myself coming back to the romantic era when things seemed so much simpler. I know they weren't but time slows down and people are allowed to appreciate the sky, trees, woods, meadows, green grass and even their eating schedules. Trying to compare their financial independence in their terms, to me, is astonishing. I also find myself grateful for the ways orphans are taken care of since their time. I'm going on...I just love stepping back into time and relishing the things we all take for granted today. It humbles me…

0385349947|5.0|This book made me think.<br />Just like a lot of other reviewers, I have experienced the scenarios mentioned by the author. I would certainly be able to improve many aspects of my work place behaviour as well as thinking based on her point of view.<br />Author has had financial backing that many women/men dont but that does not change what she explains about behaviour or culture. Even if you are not aiming to be COO of the next big thing in corporate world, this book will be helpful.<br />For that matter, even for a women not trying to climb the corporate ladder, this book helps put in perspective a lot of aspects of working in male dominated world, and provides tips on dealing with it.<br /><br />Some critical reviews say that the author does not tell you how to start a business even though she has worked for many such sucessful start ups, which in my opinion is irrelevent in the context of this book. The concepts explains by this book are applicable to all women in any type of career. Even if you are a start up, you do need to overcome the gender bias, or the biased perseption. You also need to divide your time effectively between work and family. You do need to think about mentoring other women. All these points are still valid!<br /><br />If you are a working woman, in any field and at any post, I reccomend this book.

0061122416|5.0|This has become one of my favorite books by means of meaning. The story is a little far fetched but the author did that to add lots of stuff that will last a life time.

B00AOG6P86|4.0|The first time I ever heard Don Giovanni decades ago, I thought it was boring, tedious and too long. The next time I heard it I fell head over heels in love with it and couldn't stop playing it. The difference? The first time was the Klemperer recording on Angel, reissued in this box. The second time was the earlier Giulini recording on the same label. Night and day.<br />EMI gave Klemperer some wonderful casts for these performances and it irks me that the other two da Ponte operas, Nozze and Cosi, couldn't have had Giulini or virtually any other conductor on their roster at the time.<br /><br />That said, the Magic Flute recording is very successful even without the spoken dialogue, Klemperer's approach is devoted and serves the music well, superbly cast and altogether absorbing. It's probably the best Flute recording of its era, though I wouldn't be without the Boehm DG set either.<br /><br />Now if I could speed up the da Ponte sets without altering pitch and vocal timbre, digitally feasible, they might finally be accessible to me! Might be worth a try...
B00B9366VO|4.0|This is a mostly satisfying description of how some great music was recorded in an unlikely location. It is chock-full of some of your favorite musicians (and perhaps a few that you could live without hearing). It is also a great tutorial on the difference between recorded music as craft and recorded music as crap. Drags near the end once the Neve console is removed from its original home but this production makes overall for some mighty fine viewing.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Absolutely love this version, it delves deeply into the relationship between Jane and Rochester. Stays relatively true to the book, so if you want it to be EXACTLY like the book, it isn't. This gives us a much deeper understanding of Jane, and Rochester, and their personalities. It doesn't go into her childhood much. Acting is SUPERB, LOVE IT! though the other versions are wonderfully done as well, this one is my favorite.

B000VSAEYI|4.0|After reading about all the pools that had holes in them, I decided it was still worth a try.  We got lucky, it came in perfect condition and we have been using it almost every day during the summer.  Our neighbor liked it so much that she bought one as well.  She got one with a hole, which she sent back.  The next one had hole too, but it was small enough that she decided to keep it.  It deflates after a few hours.  Ours have been keeping up great.  We've only had to put more air in it about 3 times the whole summer.  The palm tree is a bit of a waste in my opinion, as it doesn't stay up well and just gets in the way.  Because of that, I have not really used the small pool area behind the slide.  This pool holds up fantastically well, as my niece and nephew &#34;abused&#34; it one day while over at our place.  They are 6 and 8, and were literally jumping on the slide at the same time.  I thought for sure that was going to be the end of our little pool, but it didn't even deflate a bit.  It's quick and easy to set up and fill and the toys are a great addition.  I (as well as my toddler) love this pool and would buy another one in a heartbeat.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|Have you ever wondered what life was like for the ordinary people of North Korea? We hear a lot about their politics and military, but very little about what life is really like there for people like you and me. This book takes a close look at a half dozen lives of ordinary North Korean citizens. The author  interviews the (now) defectors and relays their stories to us as she peppers them with bits of Korean landscape and history. It's all compelling, but maddening at the same time.<br /><br />Demick's sole purpose of writing this book is to tell us in the masses what every day life is like in North Korea. She does exactly that in a clear, concise narrative of her subjects' lives over the course of a 15 year time period that includes the reign of Kim Il Sung and that of his son, Kim Jong Il. She is simply telling the stories of these families without any judgment at all. Just the facts are presented. As a reader though, you will judge. You will feel pity, you will be upset. I wanted to scream. But I hope the masses read it anyway.<br /><br />Many of the stories in this book take place in the 1990s. The 1990s! (I'm still shocked) This was a time when I was living in Chicago and living my version of the dream. It still astounds me that while I was living it up, people were living like this and not questioning it. In my lifetime. On our planet. It disgusts me.<br /><br />I knew nothing about North Korea before this book, other than what the news tells us. Lives there are horrific and people there are brainwashed into thinking their conditions are better than anyone else's in the world. Speaking of the world, there is no contact with it for a regular North Korean citizen. TVs and radios have all had their channel selectors welded to make only the government run channels available to residents. There is almost no electricity, very little running water and famine. Widespread famine. People do not have the luxury of meals, let alone access to the necessary food they need to live. You wouldn't believe what people there have had to do just to eat something.<br /><br />Adults are dying, children are dying.<br /><br />Demick thoughtfully interviews people of different ages, romances and education. Things that are normal to everyone, right? But, they happen in a world that is very much like Nazi Germany. With many, many rules. The maddening part of this is that many of the people of North Korea still worship \\"The Great Leader\\" or \\"The Marshal,\\" as they're known, anyway. They don't know any different. They're told how evil the rest of the world is. They're constantly reminded of how poor the rest of the world is. They're even forced to keep and clean portraits of these men in their homes. (The government checks to make sure they're up and clean). At the least, their lives are a case study for brainwashing. The Great Leader forces them to work, without pay, because it's their \\"duty\\" to the Worker's party (that many of them can't be a member of anyway). He makes them wear certain types of clothes or hairstyles to make their \\"class\\" obvious to others. Class is a big thing to the North Korean leaders, and they use it to play against people constantly.<br /><br />It's an insane story, one that you might see in an apocalyptic movie. It is heartbreaking. It is maddening. But read it anyway.<br /><br />If there is any kind of happy ending to this book it's that the people Demick interviewed for it got out.  Somehow they started thinking for themselves. They saw the hypocrisy. It took a lot of courage, bravery and sometimes quick thinking to literally save their lives and get out. Oh, and corrupt government \\"party workers\\" too. This might be the one time corruption may be helpful - hunger pains win over party loyalty I guess.<br /><br />The sad part for me is that this is all still going on for people who can't change (or don't see a reason to) their situation.<br /><br />I can't recommend this book enough. It's for anyone who is interested in North Korean life, international sociology, international politics or communism. This is the first book I've read on the subject, but it will not be the last. I appreciate how well this book has been written. Demick, an award winning writer AND reporter who now leads the Beijing Bureau of the Los Angeles Times, is an intelligent, gifted writer. She writes for us - the ordinary people who want to learn more. It's one of the best books I've read in 2013. But, warning: the story is horrific.h Korean life, international sociology, international politics or communism. This is the first book I've read on the subject, but it will not be the last.

B00EH6SK78|5.0|It can sometimes take me more than the intial listen of an album for me to take to it. Such was the case with this release from DevilDriver. Upon hearing the track Ruthless, I was instantly excited. Beast, I thought, was their best and that the band hand reached the top of the mountain with that album. At first, I thought Winter Kills was a little generic, with the exception of tracks like Ruthless and Gutted. But, like I said, after listening to it every day, nearly non-stop, I really started to notice what the band did here. I feel DevilDriver is a band who has been around long enough that they really don't have to change it up too much from album to album anymore. In my opinion, Winter Kills is just as good as Beast and shows that the band can keep going and create something new without having to change the recipe drastically, like most bands make the mistake of doing. The band seemed to have a hit-and-miss streak with their albums where Fury of Our Maker's Hand and Pray For Villains were, I feel, weaker than those albums that came before and after them. So, with that, I feared the follow-up to Beast would be another weak effort, but I was surely wrong. DevilDriver is definitely a band who keeps on on rollin' and doesn't stop impressing.

B009AOFNU4|1.0|I badly wanted to love this controller. It seemed like a simple mobile solution for gaming, and was even kinda comfortable in my big hands. Android paired no problem, but offered limited games to play. I love RPGs, Square Enix in particular, but no SE titles are compatible. Kemco titles worked OK, but felt jerky. FPS games like Dead Trigger worked with few problems (super high sensitivity, button mapping), but overall did not gain much over the touch screen interface.<br /><br />Windows was a frustrating mess. After pairing (and repairing), I was able to try a few platformers from Steam (Mark of the Ninja, Deadlight, and Super Meat Boy), and they worked just fine with mild delay. Compared to my wired Logitech controller, though, the lag was ridiculous.<br /><br />I did not try any iOS devices with this product.<br /><br />This controller is slick, comfy, and frustrating. I wanted to love this so badly, but the pieces didn't fall into place.

B00CA4S3UI|5.0|To put it simply, Magnus Karlsson's 'Freefall' is an exquisite work of melodic metal. I really can't emphasize that enough. The songs are satisfyingly heavy, with plenty of guitar pyrotechnics and double-bass drumming, but they have a sense of melody that is stunning. Honestly, I don't know how the man does it, but he seems incapable of writing a bad song.<br /><br />Each song is perfectly crafted to match the vocals of the various singers, and he always seems to bring the best out of them, including the three on which he sings.<br /><br />\\"Free Fall\\" features Russell Allen of Symphony X and Adrenaline Mob. Allen has worked with Karlsson on the three Allen/Lande projects (with Jorn Lande). Allen's vocals here fall somewhere between the ultra-clear operatic vocals he used on early Symphony X albums and the gruff \\"metal\\" voice he's cultivated lately. It's a nice touch.<br /><br />\\"Higher\\" features Karlsson's Primal Fear band mate, Ralf Scheepers. They also worked together on Scheepers's solo album. Scheepers turns in a powerful, melodic vocal here. Possibly one of the best I've ever heard from him. Strong and clear, with some soaring notes.<br /><br />\\"Heading Out\\" is Karlsson's first vocal performance here, and he proves to have a pretty stellar voice himself. He's not just \\"carrying a tune\\" here, he sounds great. If I hadn't already looked at the vocal lineup before listening to this song, I would never have guessed it was him.<br /><br />\\"Stronger\\" features Tony Harnell of TNT. Harnell and Karlsson worked together on two Starbreaker albums, which introduced me to Harnell, who has become one of my favorite vocalists. This might be my favorite song on the album, although it's also the mellowest. It's a heartbreaking ballad, and Harnell goes all out, hitting seemingly every note in his incredible range. Please, let there be another Starbreaker album. These two make magic together.<br /><br />\\"Not My Savior\\" features Rick Altzi of Masterplan. This was my introduction to his vocals, as the new Masterplan (his debut with the band) came out a week after 'Freefall.' This is one of the more aggressive songs on here, and Altzi has a nicely gruff voice that fits it well. His performance made me look forward to what he would do with Masterplan (he did not disappoint). I'm not aware of Karlsson and Altzi working together before, but I hope they do so in the future.<br /><br />\\"Us Against the World\\" features David Readman of Pink Cream 69 and Voodoo Circle. I'm fairly new to Readman, having heard him for the first time on the latest Voodoo Circle album earlier this year, but I have quickly become a big fan. He has an incredibly rich, bluesy voice Karlsson takes full advantage of. Again, I'm not sure if Karlsson and Readman have worked together before, but since two of Karlsson's Primal Fear band mates (Alex Beyrodt and Mat Sinner) are also in Voodoo Circle with Readman, it's not hard to imagine one or both of them suggesting Readman.<br /><br />\\"Our Time Has Come\\" features journeyman Mark Boals, currently of Iron Mask, formerly of Royal Hunt and Yngwie Malmsteen, and a ton of other guest appearances. Boals and Karlsson collaborated on The Codex in 2007, and it's nice to hear his voice here. I've listened to a lot of his work in the last year, and while I think he has an incredible voice, it's not always utilized to the fullest. Karlsson knows how to make anyone shine, and when that vocalist is already powerful, you have the makings of a great song. Any chance of The Codex 2?<br /><br />\\"Ready or Not\\" is Karlsson's second vocal performance. Ditto my previous comments.<br /><br />\\"Last Tribe\\" features Rickard Bengtsson, who was the lead vocalist of one of Karlsson's first bands, Last Tribe. They disbanded after their third album in 2003, and I don't know if Bengtsson has done anything since. If he hasn't, it's a shame, because he is a fantastic vocalist, and it doesn't sound like he's lost anything in those 10 years. Here's hoping he gets back into music.<br /><br />\\"Fighting\\" features Herman Saming of A.C.T., formerly of Locomotive Breath. I've not heard either of these bands, and I don't know the connection between him and Karlsson, but I'll have to check his other stuff out. Can I figure out another adjective to describe a great vocal performance? No? Okay, I'll just go with that.<br /><br />\\"Dreamers & Hunters\\" features Mike Andersson of Cloudscape. Karlsson and Andersson collaborated on the Planet Alliance project, where Andersson provided all lead vocals. I've since been listening to the Cloudscape albums and have added them to my wish list. I like his voice a lot. Very expressive and melodic, but with a slight gruffness to it.<br /><br />\\"On Fire\\" is Karlsson's third vocal performance. Again, he proves he can do it all.<br /><br />I sincerely hope Karlsson has a follow-up because there are some curious absences on here. Where's Jorn Lande (the other voice of the Allen/Lande projects)? Where's Bob Catley (for whom Karlsson wrote all the songs on 'Immortal,' Catley's last solo album)? Where's Tony O'Hora (for whom Karlsson wrote all the songs on 'Escape Into the Sun,' O'Hora's first solo album)? Where's Michael Kiske (for whom Karlsson wrote songs on the Kiske/Somerville and Place Vendome projects)? Where's Amanda Somerville (of Kiske/Somerville)?<br /><br />These questions aside, have I made it clear that I love this album? If you enjoy any of the artists I've mentioned in this review, or if you just like melodic metal with lots (and I mean, LOTS) of excellent guitar work, I think you will, too.
B00DNLXDUW|2.0|I found the app Harder to configure than the out of the box Kindle email app, when accessing a private label gmail instance.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Even better than Abram's 2009 first effort. The post conversion process to 3d has come a long way since the abysmal CLASH OF THE TITANS. The cast with the additions of Benedict Cumberbatch, Peter Weller and Alice Eve give excellent performances. The pace is breathless and I consider this the best popcorn movie of the year
B0093WVND4|5.0|I like this book and I recommend this book for  Jacob!  It is great for the big wide good world.
B008QZ1ZYQ|3.0|Works to kill some time, kept me going for a good half an hour before i was bored of the repetitiveness
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This this is a little powerhouse. Built very well. Nice tough hard shell plastic exterior with very serious metal contacts on the outside. It feels like it will never break. Two USB ports that can work with just about anything, but with the added bonus of adding quick charging for iPhones and Androids if you use the ports that are labeled to accordingly. Anker has been really surprising me ever since I bought one of their external battery chargers which blew me away with it's built quality. I'm sticking with them from now on since everything they put out is built very dependably as well as being very well thought out.
1444710338|5.0|Very easy to read and follow.  Finally a diet you can follow for life that is enjoyable and very sound.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|We loved this movie. Had a great story and kept you interested the whole time. I was not usually into zombies, but this one was good.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|after three seasons drudgery set in and nothing really new and exciting happening. My opinion is very iimportant to me.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Who cannot help but love any movie with Hugh Jackman??  I enjoyed this movie when it was in theaters and I am so happy to be able to watch it over and over at home with my family!
B00EMJBVAI|3.0|I will watch movies that I really like two or three times over the course of a few years. This is not the case here. I was really excited to see this movie but was somewhat disappointed. But be your own judge. 3 Stars.
B00EI6E17A|4.0|Can't wait for the full album. Another in a long line of hits... and yes, ever 50+ granddads can be little monsters.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|The not knowing keeps the mind wandering what will happen could've happened this is a great book. Secrets aren't always meant to be known
B009NNG202|3.0|Interesting casting made this movie more interesting than it should have been.  I enjoyed reading the book some years ago, but this movie left me cold.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I really like Margaret Atwood's futuristic stories.  This is the third in a trilogy in which man has done much tinkering and slicing of DNA, mostly to our detriment.  This third book continues the story of Toby and finally connects it with Jimmy's.  What was really fascinating was to see how a new creation myth was coming into being.
6301792734|1.0|Not happy with this item. I have no vhs  player! Did<br />not notice that it wasn't a dvd when I was ordering it.<br />.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I bought the case to go to Cancun, I used it fine for a few days but once it suddendly opened and my iphone got wrecked.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book has changed the way I look at the world and how I treat people. I read the book a long time ago but I still remember the whole story. It makes you think. You get to know the main character and start to feel for. The story takes you to places that you would expect and sometimes shock you, but it is one of the best books I have read!!! You wont regret reading this book!
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very addictive. I love it the higher you go in levels the more energy you gain. I look forward to unlocking rooms.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Major manufacturing/quality control defect in the 3D version of this film: no main menu selections are displayed (just the background for the menu options), and so the movie cannot be played.  I sent the disk back to Amazon, but the replacement disk had the same problem.  Once or twice I was able to get the main menu onscreen (Play/Settings/Scenes,) and then the film could be played, but on these rare occasions, the disk had been loaded in the same way as the numerous other times when the menu would not come up, and so it was not clear what could be done--if anything--to get it to work correctly. (The Blu-ray version does not have this problem.)  Buyer beware!<br /><br />Update: The movie can be played if you assume that the \\"Play\\" option is displayed on the home screen (even though it isn't) and if you hit the \\"select\\" button on your remote.  But the \\"scenes\\" selection option will not get you past the first group of scenes, past scene #5.  In any case, this is a significant technical glitch that should have been caught.
B00931JMRE|5.0|I was a halfway fan of their old stuff, but this album has me all in, and has made me more of a fan of their music. Neat to see an old band not lose a step and actually improve.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|One of the best shows on TV.  Keeping track of the many charecters is a bit of a challenge, but look forward to the next season
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This is really an enjoyable movie. It has a really good mix of action and dialogue. Of course, the CGI is very good.
1591843065|3.0|Not so much to take out of the book but interesting and somewhat inspiring on how graphics can enhance business language.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I loved this show!!! So nice to watch something wholesome, you don't have to worry if something is going to be inappropriate, or crude. Super refreshing.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I attended one of the concerts on the tour and the album is like reliving the experience.  I only wish they had included all 50 songs!
B00594XOZU|3.0|i have kik on my phone and its the best app on my phone but i found kik for my kindle and i cant download it for some reason so please let me download it......please
159463176X|5.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down. I loved the way each story intertwined and was told from a different perspective. I think this was as good as kite runner.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really love this game. I play it every day. I am addicted to it. I hate when it freezes in the middle of the game and I have bingos that I cant collect on. I wish you would correct this problem. I have played other bingo apps and none of them ever freeze.
2839905809|4.0|very cool theory and approach. Needs some refinement in reality but absolutely to be recommended if you want to know how to build a meaningful business model.<br />Tested it in many cases and always a surprise to people not knowing this method. Fosters structured discussions and is a great method to explain your business (thoughts) to any outsider.<br />A word of critics... in some aspects somewhat outdated.. would need a 2nd edition to keep touch with the turns of the economy
006178480X|5.0|You can pick up the sigma force series at any point. Fast paced, action packed with current science thrown in.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|I have seen their strategy skills improve while playing this game.  They are 6.5 and 8. Great gameplay on Kindle Fire HD.
B001NLL93W|4.0|This is a great series, quick easy read.  Even though the plot is simple the author does a great job of making all the characters very likeable.  Also a cliff hanging ending that makes you want to get into the next book.
B00CH87HF4|2.0|great little game but I don't have the money it takes to win the game. like most of the item shop games this one sells the best gear for acctual money. I love the game but, I bate games were you pay to win....
B00B7I8HZ4|5.0|I have been waiting many years for a box just like this to replace my aging single core HTPC.  My HTPC plays an integral role in my household, so I needed a device that is easy enough to operate that grandma can use it and that it &#34;just works&#34; like a DVD player or TV.  This is the second try at replacing my old system.  The first try was purchasing a Pivos XIOS, however the XIOS was way underpowered for XBMC and I returned it.  The Intel NUC stepped up to the plate and really hit a home run for me, although it is roughly double the cost.  Much like another reviewer, i am running my setup off a 16gb USB thumb drive and 2gb of memory, which if you are running OpenELEC, is more than sufficient.  I didn't bother purchasing a real solid state drive because i am streaming all my files from a Synology NAS via 100mb UTP.  This box plays my largest mkv files in full 1080p without any stuttering what so ever, even on complex scenes.  It also integrated seamlessly with my harmony remote, which I might add not only wakes the system up when you press the activity button, but also automatically puts it to sleep when you change activities back to normal TV watching.  I'm not even sure how much that matters though because the device only uses between 10 and 13 watts when it's on and playing movies (less than 1 watt in standby), so you could in theory just leave it on all the time without much impact.  Boot up time is equally impressive, typically being ready to use in about 10-15 seconds from the time you push the power button.  I can't wait to buy another one of these for the car, as well as more for the kids rooms.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was skeptical about how this would work. Such a little gadget but it works perfectly. Very happy after using it for the past few weeks
0525425772|5.0|Quick read but captivating from first word to the last.  Love Theodore Boone and his adventures and cases in each book.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|its really fun I bet you will like it this app is free today so hurry and get it its fun you have to find a way to get the sugar in the cup
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game have slot of fun playing it .the game is easy to play and the replay value keeps you coming back for more.
B002TLSSXO|3.0|I have owned my set now for quite some time and it has held the color and such well from being used quite often. It is quite overpriced, but the standoffs on the bottom of each piece were a selling point, but after quite awhile you learn that is all they were. You end up using a spoon rest/holder, paper towels underneath...etc...just like was used with the old set these replaced.  These were a colorful gift and with me I put them to use, but personally I would not have bought these, just way overpriced for the functions they perform in the kitchen and while the standoff is a selling point, it does not really function all that great.  So it that doesn't bother you and you are looking for some colorful, expensive additions to your kitchen then this set just might be for you...I have to honestly admit..I do like the colors, it brightens up my kitchen.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I dont usually read books but I could not put this one down and read the whole thing in one night. You wont be disappointed with this one.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|This is a great show and it came with the digital version also.  I'm glad that anyone can buy the previous seasons to catch up on their favorites
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|She saved her money to purchase both of the 1D cd's. Very fast shipping, and love the auto rip feature. We were able to have it on our kindle's right after the purchase. She was very excited to listen to the songs, before the cd even got here.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Again another true artist.  I love &#34;I Didn't Know My Own Strength&#34;.  She too will be missed and I will always cherish her music.  ~RIP~
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Very well written and entertaining.  Nice description of entire life, hike, and everything along the way.  Glad she took the time to write and share her experience!
B00D82BNLC|5.0|COAST TO COAST PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION: THE JOURNEY UNDERNEATH is probably one of the more thrilling paranormal adventures I've read. A deep, suspenseful story of a group of investigators who were led into a notorious Greenhurst Hospital that had been shut down and abandoned for many years. In a bid to unravel one of the oldest mysteries of Greenhurst, they are led into a dangerous world of oddities and phantom-like creatures.<br /><br />Carolyn writes with the skill of a professional. A deep, insightful read that will only leave you clamouring for more of her works.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Thought they did a good job closing off as many of the plot lines as possible. Probably could have just been titled &#34;The Last Battle&#34; since that was the whole book.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|i love it. this is what music is. (sorry about this park, i needed twelve more words) word word word

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I am a big fan of the fifty shades of gray trilogy, but I would say I am a bigger fan of the crossover novels and can't wait for her next one. A great read!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It's an interesting game, however, it would be nice to have a &quot;hint&quot; button or something. Looking for the clues and figuring out the order they go in is challenging and a hint button would really come in handy.
0399165274|5.0|Loosely following  a formula that made him famous in \\"Day of the Jackal\\"  Forsyth sets up a manhunt moving around the world to apprehend or kill a terrorist known as the Preacher.  The Preacher is hunted by a star of one of the U.S. government's unknown  organizations tasked with doing whatever is necessary to put down enemies of our country, and is known as the Tracker.<br /> The Preacher is an English speaker that through the computer  reaches Muslim youths living in the U.S and England and through lectures converts them into killers willing to die to inflict horrors on innocent people.  Forsyth introduces a myriad of details about the operating world on both sides, all of which supply an insight into the behind the scenes planning going into<br />keeping terrorists from completing their work of killing others via their own suicide.<br />  The book is vintage Forsyth returning to his original form in keeping his readers absolutely glued to the pages.  Both protagonists are very well fleshed out.  We get to understand the motivation of the Preacher in wanting to kill innocent people even though his reasons are murky at best.  The Tracker is handed a personal reason to get his enemy and put finish to him doing the work and extra devotion he puts into it.  The agency the Tracker works for could prove a good basis for future novels even if the Tracker himself is not included
B004J09ONG|5.0|I liked the story of how the lioness Elsa bonds with Joy. The plot was was enjoyable and the mood through out the movie<br />was lighthearted.
B000001FYL|1.0|About 20 seconds of the first song played and that was all that was on the CD.  Very disappointed.  Lesson learned.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|I think there is just one cut on here that I would not endorse.  Aside from that the cd is solid and I love the mix of talent of Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Chrisette Michelle, Music Soulchild and Ledesi to name a few in addition to the musicology perpetuated in this compilation. I give it a solid 10+ and am looking forward to more music from this genre! Oh by the way...my girl is on this cd...Ms. Lalah Hathaway!
0385737955|5.0|The Maze Runner was an amazing book that I couldn't put down. The book had great pacing, taking you day by day into the life of Thomas. I extremely excited for the movie and I hope they create the same suspense that the book put me through. This book is rated 5 stars for a reason, and I suggest it to anyone who enjoys dystopian novels.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game.  Looking forward to more levels.<br />Loved the challenge.<br />Lots of fun to play.  Give it a try.<br />Liked the hidden items.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|Excellent movie! Funny, great action and sinister villains. The movie is so well casted! The witty banter is spot on and even the sad parts you can't help but shed a tear. See this movie!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Yes it did wake me up but I am a light sleeper, I don't think it would get my son out of bed.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is awesome me and my sister love it I think people who all ways wanted a horse and never got one realy like this game like me and my sister don't have a horse yet but my beaver down the road has one and we go vist it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The thought of reading a book about kids with cancer is depressing before you even open the cover but this book was very different.  The perspective from which it was written was excellent and you feel as though you really know these kids.  I would read this again, just wonderful!
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Lousy upgrade. Too busy and not user friendly. Too many places to look for info. Old app much easier to use and see.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I RARELY don't finish a book. In my entire life I have only not finished 3 books before. One, because I lost it and 2 because they were THAT bad and THAT boring. This book is one of the latter. I read the first of this series and it was a laugh. I struggled through it because I kind of wanted to know how it ended.<br /><br />It was also the reason I purchases this second book. But when I discovered that it picks up not 2 weeks later, I remembered why I thought this was such a joke in the first place and I gave up.<br /><br />Honestly, good for the author for being able to rope in so many people, but I just don't get the hype over these books!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Youtube app is ok. It does not work as fast as I thought. It is better than just going to YouTube.com
B00000DGUY|5.0|Love every song! Such a brilliant Dire Straits album full of great tunes! Would make a great gift for any fan!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|As with most games that support in game purchasing, I wish there were more ways to earn &quot;in game cash&quot; but otherwise it's an outstanding way to experience the life of an early American settler!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|A very fun film with a lot of clever &#34;magic&#34; in it that keeps you guessing till the very end.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|it is a great game to pass the time to and is challenging in some rooms . it's a fun game.
B008Y6YCB0|5.0|This is a wonderful story.  Gwyneth Paltrow is sweet and funny as Emma, the girl trying to play matchmaker to all her friends.  And Jeremy Northam is charming as Mr. Knightley, her patient family friend.  Supporting actors are good, too.  I love the dancing.
B00000IQMT|4.0|I have the DVDs of all six episodes and decided that I would also like to have the soundtracks. I chose this rating because the music on this particular soundtrack is fantastic! John Williams is also a great composer and conductor. When one watches the DVD, you tend to concentrate on the action and not the music - therefore it is a great opportunity to listen to the music on its own. I can certainly recommend the CD to Star Wars fans and people who like good music.
B000I62JBE|4.0|I always enjoy DeNiro's acting, but Brando was absolutely fabulous here.  The true-life friendship these two actors shared shined through as they played off of each other.  Edward Norton took his role and ran with it.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|my grandchildren loved watching this movie.i been told by them this was a great gift, that i gave them. thanks
B00DNLXDUW|3.0|I really like this app.  Is a nice addition to Kindle interface.  Clean.  Easy to read.  My only complaint,and this is a significant complaint, is that I can't get the search feature to work.  Neither the Kindle magnifying glass on the bottom task bar nor the Gmail magnifying glass included in the app give me a search box.  This, in my opinion, is a major functional issue that impedes it's usefulness to some degree.  Hopefully it will be corrected in an update.  Other than that, very nice app.
B002KKCVUA|5.0|My husband love it! He told me that it is very comfortable and fits very well. It is hard to find a comfortable tennis shoes. So when i saw this sandals, I thought maybe this is the one the will give him comfort just walking around.  I notice that his been using it everyday. The sandals exceed all expectations.the quality construction also is superpb. I will recomend this product for those people that is tired of using uncomfortable tennis shoes.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Really fun game. I play tournament mode a lot and I like the many options for upgrading units. Not easy and very addicting. Highly recommended!
B0031RS8NK|5.0|I really loved this book. It had everything a person needs. A little supernatural among with romance and a lot of realistic staff.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Very imaginative and thrilling couldn't wait to read each book.  Great character development. Right up there with hunger games. Brilliant.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I don't love it as I did her previous albums, but it's still pretty good and nice to listen to.
B00005JNX0|4.0|I ordered this copy used from GoHastings and I have yet to be disappointed by them so far!<br /><br />The movie itself is a good movie and has a good story line about the pampered zoo animals that have to adapt to the wild and their own wild natures.  It has a lot of quotable moments and injects a lot of humor while still keeping the sentiment of friendship and working together as the main focus of the story.  Good family movie and has a lot of entertainment for everyone in the family.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|I NEVER write reviews, but I had to for this game!  At first I thought this would be a simple, mindless game to just pass the time here and there.  I couldn't have been more wrong!  This game is challenging and requires quick thinking, patience, and creativity.  Each level challenges you even further, which in turn leads to an addiction to this crazy, wonderful game.  I am currently on level 23, and I just downloaded it a couple of hours ago.  My biggest concern is that I won't be able to put it down tonight, and I will have to figure out a path for the sugar which leads directly to a large pot of coffee tomorrow morning!
B0040UAYI4|5.0|Being an avid pc gamer I do not handle controllers well. I needed something to play those can't miss console exclusives. I got this primarily for The Last of Us. Let me start by saying that this device turns the inputs of a controller into keyboard and mouse movements. It does not &#34;add&#34; new controls. That being said this device really shines when you take the time to tweak the dead zones. If you plug this in straight out of the box you will be disappointed. It took me several tries to get the Last of Us to where it felt like I was playing a pc game. That game was never designed for the precision of mouse movements so tweaking the device was a bit of a challenge. Now that I have it where I want it the game is just that much better. I have also purchased a few other games to try this out on, like the Uncharted and Killzone series. Getting Last of Us dialed down was a learning curve, but I'm confident I can get those other games to where I want them as well. My kid is really getting a kick out of being able to play better due to the mouse.  Only complain I have is that it will only remember 2 key mappings at a time but that is a moot point considering price vs. functionality. If you take your time and give it some trial and error this device is fantastic and well worth the money. If your a pc gamer but don't want to miss those console exclusives (or just can't stand a controller) this here is your baby.
B003SHDP4K|4.0|I read this book in 2 weeks or so, reading during the evenings before going to sleep. The story was something very refreshing at the time it came out the first time, different to other books in the genre.  It kept me turning page after page. If you are a devoted christian you may hate it, since it claims Jesus was married and had children, but still I don't see what is wrong with that, any way, remember that it is just a piece of literature.<br /><br />I read it because all the media hype caused by the religious controversy. It is an enjoyable reading though, but not the best in the genre, however it has become a classic, a must read, so go for it.<br /><br />Things I didn't like, is it that at the beginning it seems to put all the blame for the crimes on the Opus Dei creating a lot of controversy and high expectations for a great conspiracy theory, but at the end of the book, he sets them clear by saying that it was only a few rotten apples within them. I believe this was more a political move from the author in order to avoid confrontation with this powerful religious organization.<br /><br />Some parts of the book are very clever and the book keeps you really interested, some other are a bit dumb, for example, Landon is a genius and an expert deciphering secret codes, but he struggles to read a mirrored text, common, even I was able to  decipher it at a first look, and I'm no expert. But anyway, the other secrets codes are more believable and convincing.<br /><br />I've read first the book and I saw the movie months later. I must say that I enjoyed the book much more, many details were omitted in the movie, possibly for time constraints.<br /><br />Conspiracy theories, secret codes, mysteries and extraordinary claims without any evidence at all, but still a fun read, this is\\"The Da Vinci Code\\". Give it a try, my score 3.6 starts rounded to 4.
B0051SDM5Q|5.0|Very easy read, with interesting ideas about how to best negotiate any type of contract, etc.  Highly recommend it to anyone.
B0018XSU3W|5.0|Everyone should read this book before having a relationship.  It makes so much sense in understanding man and woman thinking and behavior.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|i really love this CD, for all you Skrillex and Dubstep fans this is a must have!!! great condition! and Sound!!
B001AZFO14|5.0|Kurt Russell has matured as an actor since his Disney movies ( the computer wore tennis shoes).  The understated emotional byplay between main characters with the simple main plot make an interesting blend that keep you entertained.
1451695195|5.0|This book is very convincing about after life.  It is Interesting and well-written and I recommend it to anyone. While deep and thorough, it is easy to read..
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Bought both CDs of these performers after viewing them on my local PBS station. Great classical interpretation of popular music.
0061900656|5.0|Great book.  Shows new big brothers how life will change once the new baby arrives.  Illustrations are cute and the book is short enough that the big brother isn't overwhelmed.
B009WUBERW|1.0|I can't believe they thought this was worthing making. I'm not sure who decided all the action heros of the 80's early 90's should of pulled off a sequel to what was barely a movie to begin with. I feel asleep both times I attempted to watch the wreck.
B0064W639K|5.0|Awesome. Up there with The Dark Knight Returns for me. Basis for the Dark Knight movie. Really long too, worth the money.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Best book I have read in awhile.  Well written. I  couldn't put it down. Read it in one day and did nothing else.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I listen to this CD a lot and the DVD that came with was very entertaining. Look forward to more from these guys.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Again, the questions just disappeared as I was about to answer them.  Why are you asking for reviews without offering to reimburse me for my intellectual input?
B00F35B8F8|4.0|Nice sequel. Some very good fight scenes and special effects. The plot was obviously predictable but good to see teh evolving relationship of Spock and Kirk.
B004GKMV16|5.0|I have read many of Edward Rutherford's books, and always enjoy them, but I think this one is his best. He brings the rich history of London to life. I love the way that the characters and families that have a thread throughout the book have surprises. It would be easy to make an entire bloodline bad or good, but instead each generation although it builds on the previous one, is unique. Bad parents have good kids, good parents have bad kids. The rich become poor, the poor become rich, and not always in the most deserving ways.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun to play!  Medium level difficulty!  More enjoyment than challenge!  Lots of fun to use on my new Kindle Fire HD!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|When I got this, I could play my home movies and such. Now, Google has done something and I cannot do it anymore!! I guess I will have to return the Google Cast units I bought for me and for xmas and return them. Buy Apple TV instead as they do not limit playing your home movies. REALLY SUCKS!!!!!!!!!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Videocameras don't usually have a headphone jack but they usually do have a Composite + Sound channels output. Plug a shotgun microphone into to your camcorder and then plug your camcorder's audio output to this FiiO E06 and then plug a set of good headphones into the E06 and you can make great sound with your little camcorder. The small size of the E06 that will make any videographer happy. The E06 let's you hear live what you're recording so you can adjust the aim of your microphone or camera for the best possible sound.<br />Good sound is important to your video and the E06 lets you hear what you're recording The size of the E06 makes it easy to use with any video camera.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Purchased for my sons new kindle. Very surprised with this case. Its very sturdy, light weight and compact. My other kids want their cases replaced with this same one. It arrived quickly, too.
B00CE0BJQ8|4.0|Like it. Has a good beat and rhythm<br />Plan to give a copy to my sons.  I will enjoy theses CDs
B000JMKQX0|5.0|First of all, I can't stand people that compare books and movies (and honestly think that movies/books that inspire any other medium should have a disclaimer stating that the other medium was inspired by and not based on it). That being said, I love both the book and the movie. The vignette style of documenting the Zeke attack was just brilliant. There doesn't seem to be a particular time line but the stories &#34;collected&#34; follow about the same time line anyway, without any overlapping or back tracking to something that happened in the past that is the norm with vignettes (that I've noticed at least). Overall, a terrific read over and over again.
B00CL151G4|5.0|THe show is very well written. The characters are well thought out. They work well together. It seems like a natural progression. The episodes don't have too much fluff. There is a certain sarcasm in the shows that keeps the humor intact.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|the game numbers when you it gave lower numbers than I should have it great for you directions<br />it was a great game hope you enjoy it
B00C061I3K|4.0|Turn on the radio, and its like a trip on a traffic clogged freeway. The same noise, the same mindless tones , and the same empty lyrics over and over . The names in front of the pop track of the moment fade in and out like the morning fog, leaving your ears searching for something concrete-more to the point , something REAL to listen to that doesn't sound like remixed ,wack garbage.<br /><br />Look no further.<br /><br />Get this album, crank it from your car on the way to work, dump your radio presets and don't look back. Bravo to Daft Punk for doing something few today bother- that is, make a daring album of real music for real ears.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I first bought another stylus for my daughter in pink for 9.99 it lasted less than 24 hours before the rubber tip broke.  I then bought this one thinking at least there are 3 different tips.  She has had it for more than a couple of weeks and it still is like new!  I loved it so much I bought one for me and one for my son!<br /><br />I originally thought that the different size tips was overkill until I started surfing the net on my kindle fire hd and I found that on shopping websites the smaller tip made it easier to make selections from a typical left screen menu.  I found that I didn't have to blow up the menu in order to pick the right category.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My grandson and I are reading this series for school. (He is home schooled)  We are half way through this first book.  We are both enjoying it  immensely.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|Great album !! There are enough differences to make it worth rebuying. Although it only available in cd format. Great album packaging too!
B00CTT9646|1.0|The item showed up broken and amazon was unable to replace it because it was out of stock!  We ordered this from amazon because of the phaser, which was broke upon arrival of this product.  I will get future movies with promotions from the stores so that I can see that the item is not broken!
B001NLL93W|5.0|At first, I thought this would be my least favorite but by half way through it is definitely my favorite of the series so far! I could not put this one down either! I freaking love this series!!!!!
0316056898|5.0|My wife asked me to order this book when I picked up a couple for myself.  As I was studying, I was continually being interrupted by fits of laughter and you've got to hear this.  She read it front to back and I think she read most of it to me.  Truly a classic Tina Fey.
B009X01FJS|5.0|I have a kindle fire hd 8.9 and because covers are expensive I did my research!  In the store I looked at the Kindle brand cases and they didn't have anything that kept it closed.  I was afraid that despite the hard shell it would open if I dropped it and break anyway!  I also didn't want a huge heavy case like an Otterbox.  I am super happy with this one!  I LOVE the fact that it rotates making it easy to charge while using or while it's closed.  I even find myself using the hand strap!  The elastic closure strap is good quality and keeps it secure without being a pain to open and close! Plus it gives me something to clip my stylus to!  I is even cute!<br /><br />To sum it up, It stuck a great balance between secure without being bulky.  It is super durable and made with high quality materials.  It also has all the features you could possibly want while not looking like junky plastic!
B006PZBRCY|5.0|We had seen it already but it's an interesting twist.  The boxing robots are cool and to me less violent  than people beating up on each other. There is some violence. But for my twelve year old and myself and my husband we all liked it. There aren't alot of those!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|At first I thought that it would not be my kind of reading,but........was I wrong,I could not put it down. I loved the fact that the writer gets inside the character's head. I absolutely love it. I love how all the characters come together ,how they  are woven to come to a full story.  Wonderful.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Movie could have been 90 minutes and still would have worked.  The version with Redford was still better in my opinion...
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|This has it all--sex, intrigue, murder, mayhem.  All in that adroit, British style--with clever apophthegms throughout.  Have yet to see the American version but this is not to be missed.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Once Steve Jobs knew of his cancer diagnosis, he sought out respected biographer Walter Isaacson to author his biography.  He did not reveal this to Isaacson at the time, who at first declined Job's offer.  Jobs' wife Laurene finally made Isaacson realize that time was of the essence in accepting this offer.  Jobs sat for over forty interviews and Isaacson was given free reign to write an honest account of this entrepreneurial icon's life. All the major and minor players were interviewed in this no holds barred triumph of a biography.  Just like one of Job's elaborate and well-planned product presentations, the book was released just a few short weeks after Steve died.  He knew that there would be things in it that wouldn't be pleasant, but wanted his kids to know all about his life and that he was once young.  My favorite genre of book is a biography, and I never thought I would have read this one.  However, it was one of the most fascinating bios I've ever read.  Even if you are not a technological junkie, you will enjoy reading this masterfully written biography of a multi-faceted human being.
0395389496|5.0|The book is beautiful!  I love the fact that it came with a Christmas ornament and a CD.  I purchased this book for my new grandson that is due in October, I know that my daughter will just love adding it to his little library since it is her favorite book!
0307895475|5.0|It does help alot when you get stuck or can't figure something out. Alot better than googleing it. lots of maps and hints.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is the greatest book ever! Once I started reading I couldn't stop it had me hooked, I ended up finishing the book in 1 day. Can't wait to read the second one!!!!
B000VDDDY6|1.0|I'm not sure why this set was made. Honestly I can't think of anyone who wanted updated CGI added into the original Star Trek. Look at Star Wars, no one really wanted the SE but they came and now there's only one crappy DVD copy of the originals. Now Star trek TOS has been released on DVD twice already without being tampered with, so that's good BUT these are now harder to find. I hope that the original versions won't stop being produced on DVD leaving us only this monstrosity.<br /><br />Back to the remastered versions. I saw several episodes of it on TV, it looked terrible. The original models looked much more realistic (because they were real). The CGI models look like they were meant for an N64 game. They don't fit in and stand out. The 60s charm of the show is completely destroyed. Skip this set, its expensive, odd and lets be honest nobody wanted it.
0859537978|5.0|My baby loves this book! It was Very colorful.  the cardboard is sturdy so she can turn the pages. Received quickly too!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very interesting. Nothing like the movie. Would recommend to those who like more &#34;realistic&#34; zombie stories...lol. Liked it a lot.
B008JH5FZ6|2.0|Pretty much is a B movie,  A truly Syfy program / movie  material, I really wonder how this movie made it to the theaters.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good science fiction, but not really an original enough story... Visual effects are worth seeing,  More originality and depth please.
1572814136|3.0|Bright colours. Sometimes i can do a read and interprete and sometimes i find it difficult to learn or understand a reading. Nice looking cards. I hope that i can learn more and grow and advance. Hopefully develop my pshychic abilities too.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. For those looking to compare it to the original cast movies, you really have to not think of it as a remake but a parallel version of it. Either way it's a fun action movie.
0307592731|5.0|This was quite an interesting read. The author was very candid so that you felt you got to know her. It was fascinating to know that she went on this long, potentially dangerous, hike by herself. The people she met along the way and the experiences she had were amazing. I didn't want the book to end.....I was ready to read of more adventures.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I love this game. Still trying to get 3 stars on all challenge levels. I play a lot of Big Fish games and this is one of my favorites.
B00CX7TOTQ|4.0|I would recommend this movie to the military, Don't try to over analyze and pretty much see it wit a open mind
B00E8B1P9M|4.0|I liked watching it for the visuals and action and gadgetry.  Not the best sequel.  Renting it once is good for an afternoon. Still like Bruce Willis. The Rock puts on some great action scenes. Don't look for real depth here, just entertainment.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|From the story to the acting Downton Abbey is exceptional. The opportunity to watch it on my Kindle is also exceptional.
B00164GDD2|5.0|I'm actually surprised how well this movie stands up to time, some of the special effects in this movie look better than some of the CG they use now.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Loved this book, as it is one of Ken Folletts best.  As usual he weaves a story around the lives of several people, using history as a base for the characters and the story
B007J4T2G8|3.0|i heard all the hype about the book so had to read it was really not my type of story i was alittle dissapointed
B008602KQI|3.0|too slow and violent in the first half -- second half makes more sense and a  very good ending saves the film
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|Not a bad story. I can see why this was in 3D. Even on your home screen visuals are pretty cool. OK for most kids too.
B000IFQLSW|4.0|Nice back road blues. Great way to get to the heart of Kenny Wayne Shepherd. He is the heart and soul of the blues. Nice direction to take with regards of the music for this cd.
B004LWZW88|4.0|It's really enjoyable, the voice acting is great, and pretty funny. It's better than the last Shrek movie that's for sure.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't expect to enjoy this book as much as I did! The story started off slowly, but by the time games began I was hooked.  I can't wait to dive into the next book to see how Katniss handles her feelings for Peers and Gale.  Great book!!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Def my top 5 movies of all time. Watched it 3 times in a row, saw something new each time and never got bored!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love, love , love this show! However, I would recommend watching it when you are pregnant due to my frequent zombie stress dreams!!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This movie was somewhat panned by the critics and it made me suspicious that the best part of the movie was in the previews, as it happens sometimes.<br />Now You see ME is a GREAT movie. A concept and story and characters and special effects.<br />NOW, how do you end this? Or how do you wrap it up, explain so we can all go home.<br />Endings are important and I was not entirely on board with this ending, BUT, I still saw it twice, liked it THAT much.
B008AWBQGW|4.0|Nice to hear some new songs. Wish radio channels and concerts would reflect how refreshing they are. ( no complaints from the Skynyrd peanut gallery on the oldies but goodies ) Maybe more people will get interested in who they have become.
B000AARKOO|5.0|I have seen this movie several times on TV.  In doing so I developed the need to view it more slowly and intently so I purchased this special edition for that reason.  It has turned out to be a treasure for me in my study of the characters and I have been led to learn much by doing further research and meditation.  I am a serious student of people and of Ancient Warfare so this was truly a prize for me to find and purchase.  The film was very well done.  The main actors were superb and very convincing.  I will probably wear it out over a long period of time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy this game! It kinda sucked when I had  to re-download it as I lost all my coins, but I still enjoy playing it.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|all I can say is you have to sit down glass of wine and watch this movie it's pretty interesting
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app, it is fun, challenging and really gets you thinking. My girls and I make a game of each room to see who can get out the fastest.  What a great way to spend a little bit of quality time while sitting in a doctors waiting room or riding on a city bus, passing the time.
B000001ESF|5.0|I always liked this CD. This was a replacement for one that got scratched. I would but again if needed.
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Its good to work on cell phone, I have just started Excel in which I m still searching some format options like making borders and column lining etc.
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a story! This man was cheated out of everything by the biggest crooks in America but he was true to himself an continued to work on his inventions, An amazing man.
B003B02OOG|4.0|John Grisham's narrative always allows the reader to feel as if you are &#34;in&#34; the story setting, smell the aromas, feel the emotion, and have a very definite opinion as to how the situation needs to be resolved. However, in Grisham's stories, you can never be sure of the ending.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is my favorite angry birds game!  I can't wait for. the new one every week!! I love the way they have changed the back grounds too!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|You need to shut up because the update is here and this game is AWESOME. Shut up because you are people who play the game for 2 FREAKING DAYS AND RATE IT. I HATE YOU PEOPLE. SHUT UP AND ACTUALLY PLAY THE GAME
1934030198|5.0|This book is full of great information and insight to the inner workings of endurance training.  I got this book to improve my understanding of things like heart rate zone training, periodization and all the rest that comes with multisport training. Once I got started with the book I realized how much I didn't know and how truly complex this sport is.  Very humbling but I expect to improve my results with what I learn.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|So the first time I read this, I agreed with a lot of the other reviewers.  Too much skipping around, not enough of my favorite characters, no resolution of anything . . . Second time around I can't remember why I thought those things.  I loved it, I don't want to give anything away, but going back a second time and really reading all the chapters instead of skimming the ones I wasn't as interested in really added a whole new dimension and level of appreciation.
B00C061I1M|5.0|Love it. Heard her on PBS 'This American Life' and immediately checked on Amazon. Can't wait for her next album.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|After using both items and finding they work, my Kindle still will not work.  What do I do with it?<br />Where do I get a new battery?
B00AF46Q5Y|5.0|This book is part of a series. If you read one, you will read them all so start at the beginning.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Funny, witty, very well written. Great cast too!! Really enjoyed!! Will watch all other following episodes.ugh four more words - REALLY
0307341550|4.0|Because I loved \\"Gone Girl\\" and yet was not that enamoured of \\"Dark Places\\" I had been putting off getting around to Gillian Flynn's debut novel - so thank you to Erin Kelly for giving me the push... (Purchased in the UK)<br /><br />Camille Preaker returns to her hometown on behalf of the newspaper she works for,  to cover the murder of one child and the disappearance of another. As she becomes embedded once more into the places of her childhood some dark truths begin to emerge...<br /><br />I really am in two minds about this one - there is no doubt whatsoever that it is brilliantly written - and its not often that you get a single novel that has so many perfectly drawn, haunted characters. And I would imagine that critics (by critics I mean those people that are paid to read and review novels for some kind of media outlet) loved it for the most part. I loved it for the most part....<br /><br />Certainly it was compelling - the subject matter was terrifying, fascinating and complex and Ms Flynn creates a shadowy atmosphere that gives you a feeling of uneasiness throughout. The way she uses a sense of place to put you right in the story is dazzling - here we have a most terrific writer indeed.<br /><br />So you would think I would be putting this on my list of top reads. And yet, no, not quite. Whilst the matter of mental illness was obviously well researched and gave the whole story a depth that a standard mystery thriller would have lacked, I felt in places it was overdone. Thats not to say its not accurate - I would imagine without any actual medical knowledge that it is - but it seemed as if everyone who lived in that place suffered some form of it. There was not, as far as I found, a single character who was in any way normal, with the possible exception of the town's Police Chief, a man we find out very little about. For me this made it less authentic than it could have been - and sometimes removed me from the tale. I think you need some yin and yang personally....<br /><br />Still, its a 4* review for me because despite having said all that I cannot fault the writing or the flow. And the resolution will surprise the majority of readers I would imagine. The fact that I knew exactly where it was going quite early on is neither here nor there when it comes to my recommendation. If you love a great story, with an intriguing mystery and prefer that they are brilliantly written without cliche then you will love this. And you will never look at teeth in the same way again...<br /><br />Happy Reading Folks!y....<br /><br />Still, its a 4* review for me because despite having said all that I cannot fault the writing or the flow.

B000OLTMQ8|4.0|This was a much better closing to the Rocky series than the previous one. There are at least two great motivational speeches given in here. Those really add value to the movie.
B0084B5TK8|3.0|Great story, but lots of story gaps.<br />Wish there was an update that filled the gaps<br />Still the original version is great.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I absolutely love this game, the only thing I dont like is that it glitches sometimes then freezes. Then I have to wait for my Kindle fire to die, then recharge it. But it hasnt happened very much, so the odds are with you.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My son loved this book. This was his 1st chapter book and after finishing it he went on to read many others. Great starter chapter book.
B000062XFG|4.0|Overall this was a good purchase. However, I have seen one concern. On several of the episodes the video will freeze up for no known reason and after a few seconds it will start up again. Once it was frozen for 10 seconds.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|great series<br />refreshing approach to mystery<br />everybody 'did it' until true character of suspects revealed<br />subtle humor<br />leaves you with a 'what's next?' thought and builds on that
B000QCQ8XA|4.0|How does somebody endure such a difficult event as the death of a spouse, and live to laugh about it?  Tropper takes event after event and turns it into an avenue for introspection and laughter, pain and joy.  As with his other books, I laughed out loud and within a page or two I was marveling at his ability to explore the hurt he was enduring.<br /><br />With Tropper's books, the thing I find difficult is that when the book is over, I want to read more.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great story! Kept me reading, was hard to put down at times, and all falls together wonderfully... Glad I read it :-) Highly recommended
B00AYE8C70|1.0|I did not like viber as I got the app to text wit a relative and every time I intended to comunicate it give a message the the other party didn't have Viber , I tryany times and I finally desinstole it . I don't recommend this app
B001MSMULG|5.0|Daniel Silva breathes new life to Gabriel Allon again. New circumstances, but the same old Gabriel, told by the master of action novels.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Very exciting and well written. Got very involved with the characters. Hard to put it down to go to bed.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|It's really amazing to watch an object that appears in front of the screen appear to fall into to it, and<br />as it does see another object coming out of the screen going right past the object that is falling into the screen.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is a game that my 8 year old downloaded and I don't know if she likes it or not because she gets board with games very quickly. Sorry!
1401938906|4.0|Haven't finished reading the book yet, so far, so good. What I found so far is it is well written with a good sense of humor
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I like the way the characters interact with each other. A lot of great action. I enjoyed it, very much. The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the language. Although there wasn't much foul language, they could have done without it altogether, and we wouldn't have missed it.<br />If not for the language, this would have been a PERFECT movie, and certainly one of my favorites!
B008469DGY|4.0|The interface is really nice and work for that amount. I would recommend this app to users who wants the app to be simple.<br />Dev team has done good job.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I've never been a Swift fan -- I'm older than her and up until recently, I just didn't 'connect' with her music.  But this album is GOOD.  There are fun songs, serious songs, mature and young.  It's a good mix and blend of different sounds and styles.  So, I've really enjoyed it.  Best of all, it's been something my whole family can listen to and I don't have to change tracks when a certain song comes on.  I hope she continues this blend and keeps the mix of fun and serious.  It makes for a fun album that can really suit any mood.
0307477479|5.0|I didn't know anything about this book before I got it, it was an awesome read! It is like nothing else I've ever read before, leaves you really thinking at the end.
B00BKTFABE|3.0|This is a game that my 8 year old downloaded and I don't know if she likes it or not because she gets board with games very quickly. Sorry!
B00932A4XE|3.0|This is a really fun movie to watch with the hubby while expecting. (As long as it doesn't provoke any hormone-induced arguments! LOL)
B001DHXT6G|4.0|I didn't feel I could give it a 5 star rating because the set I bought had glue on some of the discs  By the time I realized there was glue on some of the discs it was too late to return them.  Guess I should have opened them and inspected them even though I didn't have time to sit and watch them at that time.  I didn't buy them through Amazon bought them at a big box store.  As far as the series I still enjoy watching this show.  If the quality of the discs had been A-OK I would have given this a 5 star rating.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|My daughter is 3 and loves this.  I'm not sure how much of it she understands, but she really enjoys it.
B0049J2CKE|4.0|My husband and I loved this movie, however it was too slow for my 3 and 2 year old sons :( maybe when they are a little older.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Very believable. Reccommended by friends who are Marines. Watched this movie completely in one setting which I can't typically do.
B00DYTKKGI|3.0|This is a game that my 8 year old downloaded and I don't know if she likes it or not because she gets board with games very quickly. Sorry!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|really cute game. I like that you don't have to wait hrs to get money and that you get quite a lot by collecting from everything. you find a lot of nuts too
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good book for light reading.  Kept my interest.  Good for discussion as in &#34;what would you do&#34;?  I would recommend it.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Addictive! George R.R. Martin has created a fantasy world that just draws you in and won't let you go. Get it.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|the book was difficult to follow. the timeline of the story was very confusing. You did not know if you were in the past, distant past of today. it was difficult to figure out who was narrating each chapter.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|I LOVE IT!!!! It helps me have information about English. Wolf 29/Thunderstorm !!!!<br />COMING SOON The Ledgen Of Thunderstorm is coming to YouTube.
B0091QS88K|3.0|This is a game that my 8 year old downloaded and I don't know if she likes it or not because she gets board with games very quickly. Sorry!
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|My husband & I enjoyed the movie, especially the magic tricks and the CGI. However, the big twist at the end is so huge it's just too unbelievable. Also, once the twist is revealed and you think back through the movie, there are a lot of inconsistencies and holes in the story. It's a good movie and very entertaining but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater.
B00E8JTSVG|5.0|With Beyond Bridalveil Fall (Dwellers Of Ahwahnee) being a fast pace excellent read I couldn't wait to jump into the second book Beyond Oria Falls (Dwellers of Ahwahnee) and I wasn't disappointed by this page turner. The ongoing adventure of Oria and her tribe members was very creative and had no problem keeping my attention. The story had me rooting for the golden Queen of the Ahwahneechees and all of her magical friends that try to help her along the way. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves Fantasy and Young Adult books. I really enjoyed the read.<br /><br />**I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review and I am giving one**
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|My son loves this app. But it won't let us play. It says it has a new update and to update it. But when we go to the app store to update there is nothing that says update it just says open. We hit it and again. It says to update. So now he is unable to play. Also I understand it needs ads to be able to be a free,app but the amount of ads are ridiculous and frustrated my 6 year old. Something needs to be done or I will have to uninstall it :-(

B000006NXP|5.0|Readers will note that I give the date for this recording at the commencement of my review. Those who have problems with the technical excellence of the presentation may have a point. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that some of the finest interpretations of music on record date from a period of the old 78-rpm discs and that no amount of restoration can overcome defects in early recording techniques. That said, I should not like to miss Artur Schnabel's Beethoven piano works simply because the bulk of his recordings were made pre-WW2 on a Bechstein pianoforte!<br /><br />This recording from 1981 by Carlos Kleiber with the Vienna Philharmonic is rightly judged as one of the truly great performances of the Brahms E minor. As I point out in a comment after GlynLuke's review (Amazon UK), I have probably listened to more performances of this symphony than to any other; Kleiber's interpretation must rank amongst the finest of these.<br /><br />In consideration of this I would have to include some live performances made in the early post-WW2 years at the London Henry Wood Promenade Concerts. Then the conductors Malcolm Sergent and Basil Cameron used to carry the burden of the performances, unlike the many contributions of today. There was then a traditional Bach/Brahms concert (usually on a Wednesday) conducted by Cameron that always featured the Brahms E minor. Of course, there are no recordings of these memorable evenings, nor was Cameron \\"honoured\\" or regarded as a celebrity. What he did have was an intimate knowledge of the work that no doubt benefited from his studies with the violinist Joseph Joachim, a close, lifelong friend of Brahms.<br /><br />To my understanding the notion of a definitive performance for any musical work is a misnomer. Whilst I would rank Kleiber here along with Toscanni, Furtwangler, Kubelik, Walter, and others, all give us a slightly differing experience of the symphony. In fact I would go further and say that as presented on this CD Kleiber is unmatched.<br /><br />One thing I do not wish to do with this revue is to dissect the performance into its constituent parts and to thereby detract from the point that this symphony is a supreme masterpiece of musical construction. Instead, I shall make just a few comments on the performance and then go on to give some background that listeners may find of interest when considering this recording.<br /><br />Overall, Kleiber does not indulge in rubato as was typical of Furtwangler, for example. His choice of tempo for the first movement is perfect thus enabling the music to breathe and develop. (I first became aware of this symphony's stature as a schoolboy in my mid-teens on hearing a fine performance in which the coda to the first movement realized all the energy this remarkable Allegro non troppo generates. This too is fully achieved in this performance with Kleiber.)<br /><br />Likewise in the second movement (Andante moderato) Kleiber brings out beautiful clarity from the orchestra. Brahms's use of the wind in particular fully justifies the adage that \\"with Bach one hears the organ, with Beethoven the orchestra, but with Brahms we hear both the organ and the orchestra\\".<br /><br />In the third movement the pace is lively but not so much as to blur the massive sound that frequently rises to a double fortissimo. In Brahms's day the tympani may have cut through more effectively than we can expect from its modern equivalent.<br /><br />In performance the finale should follow with as short a break between movements as is feasible (see below). In a recording this could only be achieved by running the two movements consecutively on the same track, something I have yet to come across. Brahms may have had in mind the raucous ending to his \\"scherzo\\" as a means of giving the three trombones the opportunity to \\"feel\\" their way into into the finale, their first sounding in the entire work (see below).<br /><br />There are so many points to listen out for, far too many to mention in a review but one would have to draw attention to the flute solo variation close to the middle of the movement. This is often given as a test piece to flautists auditioning for a place in an orchestra, And before that, the sawing string rhythm typical of Bach is unmistakable.<br /><br />***<br /><br />The Fourth Symphony was committed to manuscript during the summer of 1885 (first published 1886) when the composer was aged 52 and staying at M&uuml;rzzuschlag, Austria. (Brahms was a dedicated walker and often chose venues for his physical exercise as well as for composition.) He had obviously been sketching out ideas for the work some time before 1885.<br /><br />To many commentators the choice of the tonality (or key) of E minor appeared at the time both brave and controversial. Edwin Evans in his extensive analysis of Brahms's compositions writes as follows: There has been much comment on Brahms's choice of E minor for his Fourth Symphony, this key having been generally avoided by Symphonists. Berlioz was especially severe upon it, declaring openly that it was \\"criard\\" and of vulgar tendency. Riemann also remarks upon its rarity as a symphony key and can only recall J Raff's No. 9, entitled \\"Im Sommer\\"--which by the way he evidently does not think much of-- since Haydn's \\"Trauer\\" Symphony in 1772.<br /><br />Evans then goes on to \\"defend\\" the tonality of E minor which would seem superfluous for us today since there followed closely on the heels of the Brahms Symphony in that key symphonies by Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, and later Sibelius, Vaughan Williams and Rachmaninoff.<br /><br />It is interesting that Haydn should have seen E minor as appropriate for his \\"Trauersinfonie\\" or \\"Mourning\\" Symphony (No. 44). The Brahms, although hardly a funeral dirge, is not a work of jubilation either (unless one attributes an exhibition of high craftsmanship as a celebration of a certain kind).<br /><br />That Brahms was conscious of a sense of pioneering with this symphony is evident from the correspondence at the time. Among his chosen confidants was Elisabet von Herzogenberg (wife of the composer Professor Heinrich von Herzogenberg) to whom he wrote on August 29 1885: `Might I venture to send you a piece of a piece of mine, and should you have time to look at it, tell me what you think of it? The trouble is that, on the whole, pieces by me are nicer than I am myself, and need less setting to right! But cherries seldom ripen fit to eat in these parts and so do not hesitate to say if you do not enjoy the taste--I am not wanting to write a bad No.4.'<br /><br />A similar sentiment was conveyed to the conductor Hans von Bulow who was closely involved in presenting the Symphony to the public. In fact, Brahms himself was involved in rehearsals for the first performance to be given by Bulow on October 25, 1885, after which Bulow is reported to have said (here in translation of course): \\"Number Four is stupendous, quite original, individual and rocklike; incomparable strength from start to finish.\\" And to my ears and brain this is as reasonable a description in one sentence that you might seek for this enduring masterpiece. (Richard Osborne in his admirable notice for the recording under review quotes from the philosopher Susanne Langer in somewhat more lengthy prose.)<br /><br />And so to the Fourth Symphony itself. It followed hard on the heels of the Third, as did the Second follow the First. And, as with the first pairing, these two works are sharply contrasted. Originally Brahms had two opening chords for the commencement of the work but discarded them later. As others have noted, the manner in which the work begins has a sense of having already been upon a journey, or, as Hans Keller often remarks in respect of the Haydn Quartets \\"The beginning before the beginning\\".<br /><br />This allegro non troppo (a favoured tempo marking with Brahms), in common time, opens with the first and second violins alone--a single crotchet one octave apart and spanning the octave above \\"middle C\\". They drop in the next bar the interval of a major third from where they are joined by the rest of the orchestra, excepting brass, and thus we are launched upon a journey that, if we were to follow it in detail here, would take up volumes. Let the music speak for itself! The \\"seesaw\\" effect of this opening theme is clearly related to an episode in the slow movement from Beethoven's late Piano Sonata in B flat (Opus 106) known popularly as the \\"Hammerklavia\\" and with which Brahms was intimately acquainted as a pianist.<br /><br />The movement progresses with seeming effortless invention until we come to a point, so often present in Brahms's music, where the \\"dreaming\\" has to stop, so to speak. This is achieved by a change of rhythm and is usually accompanied by upping the volume a little, usually to fortissimo. Shortly after this mood change we are made aware of the opening theme that is now put across with some emphasis. In contrast to the earlier symphonies, there is no exposition repeat; instead one may think of the entire first movement an exposition in its own right that leads on inevitably to the powerful coda.<br /><br />The conclusion to the first movement is scored for full orchestra upon a semibreve with tympani roll on the tonic E. This is wholly appropriate and makes an interesting comparison with other great symphonists, notably Haydn and Beethoven both of whom tended to end their works with a fortissimo, brief crotchet across the orchestra.<br /><br />The second movement (Andante moderato) commences with the core motif announced by two horns fortissimo apparently in the key of C major, but this is illusory when we quickly realise the tonality is that of E major. (Again with an ear to history and knowing of Brahms's great respect for the chamber music of Haydn, it may not be beyond the bounds of possibility that he had the idea for this slow movement from the older composer's Piano Trio in D, Hob. XV:24.)<br /><br />Continuing, the horns are soon joined by the rest of the wind band to expand this statement before the introduction of pizzicato strings at bar 5, by which time the sound has dropped to double pianissimo. The strings continue their pizzicato to bar 29, after which the score is marked arco with the orchestra working towards a typical Brahms dynamic interjection (refer to the first movement) at bar 36 that is to play a major role in the movement's climax.<br /><br />A master touch has to do with the theme that follows this interjection at bar 41 where the strings sing a theme that can only be described as a mixture of calm tinged with pathos. This theme is to appear later when it is proclaimed with bold affirmation by strings fortissimo (Elgar would have notated this Noblemente) following the repeat of the \\"interjection\\" then played double fortissimo by the entire orchestra. Thereafter we have the main opening theme of the movement displayed in all its glory eventually winding down to the quiet, tranquil close to the movement on E major.<br /><br />In the boisterous third movement (Allegro giocoso in C major), to which a single triangle is modestly added to the orchestral forces, we have for the first time in a Brahms symphony something approaching a scherzo (hitherto he had favoured a gentler approach with a concoction all his own, neither a minuet nor a scherzo in fact). But, unlike the third movement scherzi of Beethoven and Schubert, there is no \\"trio section\\"; instead we have a short reprieve from the high spirits in a poco meno presto played quietly and lasting a mere 18 bars before returning to a repeat of the high spirits which in keeping with the work so far has a substantial developmental coda leading to an abrupt ending on fortissimo quavers across the orchestra.<br /><br />Finale (Allegro energico e passionate):<br /><br />Although Brahms does not indicate in the score an attacca link to the finale, the interval of time between the ending of the \\"scherzo\\" and the trombones' entry should be kept to a minimum. The transition from tonality of C major to that of E minor should come as a revelation, with the trombones sounding in the symphony for the first time. Moreover, retaining the dynamic at fortissimo also gives a sense of continuity towards progressive evolvement of the eight-bar \\"theme\\", upon which the entire movement is built.<br /><br />Brahms, as is well documented, was steeped in the music of Bach so that it is not surprising to find him gaining inspiration for this finale from a Bach Chaconne presented in passacaglia form. (Passacaglia in fact permeates the entire Symphony, but that is another story!)<br /><br />Of course other composers have used variation form in the finale to their works, notably Beethoven in the finale to the \\"Eroica\\" Symphony (No. 3 in E flat) and in two of his string quartets. It is interesting to note that although Haydn made use of variation form a good deal, in only two works does this occur in a fourth movement, and both in an early keyboard trio and a symphony. (Brahms throughout his entire corpus followed Haydn more closely than he did Mozart in the use of variations.)<br /><br />Brahms's use of the theme is strictly measured and only becomes \\"freed-up\\" as we approach the end. To analyse these variations would require another volume to do them justice. Let it suffice to say that the rendering of this finale is the greatest challenge for any interpreter; one may judge the measure of their success by the impression one has when the music has stopped.<br /><br />The final pages are telling. Brahms at bar 249 writes Poco ritard, then four bars later Piu Allegro. Then to the end at bar 313, it is left to the judgement of the conductor: to inject a slight accelerando so as to bring the work to an abrupt end, or to linger a little? You, the listener, must decide which best suits your understanding of this monumental work.<br /><br />In conclusion I should like to quote from my review of a recording of Sergie Rachmaninoff's 2nd Symphony in E minor for the Rachmaninoff Society:<br /><br />By Rachmaninoff's day it was incumbent upon a composer to make a strong personal statement through the symphony. At least, this is what we are led to believe. But were Haydn and Mozart (and composers before them) less concerned with personal expression through music than were the so-called romantics? Are we not sometimes shocked to find universal human emotion spread out through both time and race? Mozart achieved something obviously tragic in his late G minor Symphony.<br /><br />But Haydn, who had a different perspective from Mozart where minor keys were concerned, could achieve deep pathos within the confines of a major key work as is obvious in many of his slow movements. Take just three examples: the beautiful largo from Symphony No. 64, the contrasting moods in the capriccio from Symphony No. 86. In the case of Symphony No 99 we even have reason to believe that he was mourning the loss of his dear friend Marianna von Genzinger.<br /><br />Beethoven in his two minor key symphonies, the fifth and ninth, seems to be expressing a mood of defiance rather than pathos. It is only when we reach Schubert's B minor Symphony (Unfinished) that we find anything suggestive of what Tchaikovsky was to achieve in his two late symphonies. But whereas in the Schubert B minor we have something sensibly cosmic in its grief (to my senses, at any rate) the Tchaikovsky B minor (Pathetique) comes across as a deeply personal utterance. Rachmaninoff never comes close to Tchaikovsky's Pathetique in this sense. The first symphony, for all the personal anguish its composer experienced as a result of a bad first performance, is more a heroic work than a pathetic one. (\\"Vengeance is mine, I will repay\\" Rachmaninoff is said to have written on the original score.) The Second Symphony is hardly a pathetic symphony either, and the Third is unique in its blend of reminiscing and bittersweet power.<br /><br />The tonality of E has never been a popular one with composers. Whilst there is no shortage from all the great symphonists of works in E flat major, few had touched E or E minor (Joseph Haydn wrote one in E minor - the Trauer - and two in E major; Schubert sketched a symphony in E). But it was Brahms who opened the floodgates with his Fourth Symphony./><br />Continuing, the horns are soon joined by the rest of the wind band to expand this statement before the introduction of pizzicato strings at bar 5, by which time the sound has dropped to double pianissimo.

B00EY8BRGU|3.0|It was fun to view this, twice, with my 20 year-old daughter who relished it.  Interesting plot, attractive young protagonists, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman along with a fully adult love-interest pair, a rumpled Columbo sort and the exotic, to American tastes, Interpol novice agent.  The plot seemed stitched together from the elaborate plans of massive magical enterprise where the execution includes the wiring diagrams for the effect.  You are left with less of a sense of wonder than bewilderment and a feeling of somehow having been duped by technology in an attempt to coerce you into believing in Magic.  Hmmm . . . Yet, although not quite an action packed thrill-ride, it was entertaining with Woody Harrelson's skepticism at least giving the viewer a voice.  This is why I gave it three stars.

B0000041LO|5.0|Haydn Complete Piano Trios Beaux Arts Trio<br /><br />Meneham Pressler (pianoforte)<br />Isidore Cohen (violin)<br />Bernard Greenhouse (violincello)<br /><br />The recordings were made in Switzerland between 1971 and 1976. This Philips compilation was released in 1991.<br /><br />The fact that these discs are still available speaks for itself.<br /><br />On Amazon UK the opinion is unanimous--all ten reviews have 5 star rating and I would wholeheartedly endorse this assessment. The picture is slightly different on Amazo.com with one dissenting voice giving a single star. (See my note in the comments section.)<br /><br />Amazon themselves do a great job here too by giving a comprehensive listing of the trios featured, a luxury not always afforded their product data.<br /><br />The discs are neatly packaged in 9 paper sleeves with an accompanying, informative 70 page booklet in four languages.<br /><br />The title \\"Complete Piano Trios\\" is comprehensive rather than strictly accurate for two main reasons. First, the authenticity of some of the earlier works is open to debate. Second, the earlier works were written for harpsichord, the transition to piano (more accurately foretpiano) coming at around Hb XV11 within the mid-1780s.<br /><br />In my review of the Joseph Haydn Piano Trios Vols. 1 & 2 Florestan Trio, 22 Dec 2011 I remark: With all this in mind one often senses a lack of adventure when groups come to record the Haydn Trios--after all, they have only to step back a few paces from \\"Gypsy Rondo et al\\" to confront some of the finest of Haydn, as in the D minor No.23 and E flat No.22.<br /><br />The Beaux was the only collection of the trios that addresses this salient point. In more recent years we have a notable contribution from the Haydn Trio Eisenstadt who record 39 trios in two box sets each containing four discs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is no comparable collection of the trios on so-called period instruments.<br /><br />In his The Piano Trio (O.U.P. 1990, Cahp. 5, page 97) Basil Smallman writes: The repertoire gained by the piano trio during the Viennese classical period up to the death of Schubert, though high in quality, is relatively modest in size. As a result largely of the genre's delayed origins, no more than two dozen first-rate trios produced (half of them Haydn's last works in the form) etc. . .<br /><br />An earlier reviewer (Marcolorenzo) remarked on Robert Schuman's negative comment in respect of Haydn, which went something on the lines that the older composer had little or nothing to offer cotemporary composers of the Schuman era. This is quite extraordinary from the writer (Schuman) who quickly noted Johannes Brahms as a flowering genius. Brahms had a more enlightened view of Haydn who could be said to have informed the younger man in many aspects of composition not least the piano trio itself. (Sample the fine Haydn Hb.,XV.22 in E flat to get a whiff of Brahms!).<br /><br />One would need many pages to do full justice both to the trios and to the Beaux Art Trio's rendering of them. As it is these recordings may be seen as one of the greatest landmarks in music's recording history.

I love movies that keep you guessing, it might not have been as intense as \\"Six Sense\\" but it keeps you entertained and I hate to admit it but I didn't guess the person running the show (maybe I too was pulled into the illusions of the magicians).  Usually within the first 30 minutes of a suspense type movie I can figure out where the story is going and who did it, so to speak.  So when a movie stumps me, I really enjoy it.  The good thing about this movie it was a light hearted suspense movie, you could relax and enjoy it at the same time you are constantly thinking, \\"ok what's next, what's really happening\\". So if you like movies that keep your mind thinking, keep your attention but in a less violent (no killer on the lose), more entertaining kind of way you will like this movie.

B000NY12LO|3.0|The writing took many &#34;detours&#34; from the main thread of the story making me lose interest at times. Unlike some of her other books, I put this one down a few times.
B009LDD1X0|2.0|What on Earth happened to you BBT? This show has officially been reduced to a sitcom focusing on the ups and downs of being in a relationship. No longer is it about 4 nerds and 1 girl learning each others ways. Slowly over the years, 2 nuisances have infiltrated a show that was once gold and that is when many people agree the show took a nose dive. Bernadette and Amy add nothing to the show except maybe to garner female viewers? They certainly do NOT belong as full time cast members. Juggling 7 people that have equal amounts of screen time and equal amounts of script into 20 minutes is overwhelming. It also takes away from the Sheldon and Penny moments which in my opinion made some of the greatest episodes. Now, unfortunately, Penny is almost always accompanied by either Leonard or Bernadette and Amy.<br /><br />Speaking of Sheldon, he is so amazingly out of character in this season it's baffling. This isn't about me wanting everyone to stay the same but I strongly believe Amy constantly being around has caused his character to change drastically. He is no longer quirky, in many cases now he is just a jerk. It has gone beyond just maturing the character to flat out destroying what made him unique.<br /><br />**spoiler**<br /><br />Let's not forget the original Sheldon would never be seen in public naked (Howard's car), spank someone, nor would he have role played sex 'D&D style.' It's a twist on his character that I only expected to see in the worst OOC offenders in Fanficion. Sheldon's asexuality was one aspect which made him a very unique character, why take that away? Now he's just turning into another Leonard at this rate.<br /><br />**end spoiler**<br /><br />Also, they have taken the complexities of certain science talk and replaced it with things more easily understood to cater to the lowest common denominator. I have a suspicion that in the upcoming seasons, what's left of the so called science discussions will devolve into the cast joking about fecal matterand/or passing gas.<br /><br />How this season got such good ratings eludes me but I know I'm not alone in how I feel about it. I feel that in the quest to gain more viewers, they took a dump on the original fanbase of this series. I will not stand for it and will no longer be watching the next season unless they somehow decide to get rid of (or strongly reduce) Amy and Bernadette's appearances in the show. Good riddance, BBT.
B00BMEF6IO|5.0|I've been a long time fan of Bring Me The Horizon and there newest album proves to me that there continuing to progress and it makes me happy how their music has progressed.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|I love the show and have been addicted since the first episode that I saw on Netflix.  I purchased season 8 because it isn't available on Netflix yet and season 9 begins in October so I wanted to be caught up on all the episodes.  The final episode of season 8 was the best episode of the whole season.  I can't wait for season 9 to begin.  The video quality was outstanding.  I downloaded it on my blu-ray and it was extremely clear even though I only purchased the SD version.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book keeps you on your toes and gives you an occasional gasp. My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this book!

B000I0XLYO|2.0|About as dumb as dumb comedies can get, Zoolander suffers from a weak plot and even weaker characters, yet the performances by Stiller, Wilson and the extremely funny Will Ferrell more than make up for it.
B004QSQML8|4.0|I love this movie, but it loses one hard star for the terrible bluray edition. Noise everywhere in the video, everything had a terrible texture to it. I'm wondering if there is a better release of this movie overseas from a different company.<br /><br />But the movie itself is awesome. So much iconic imagery and characters. Tom Cruise as Jack? Ok, whatever. Tim Curry as Darkness? Oh, there we go, set that bar high.<br /><br />With the advent of Bluray, I've been far more discerning in my video purchases, replacing and adding only key movies and tv shows in my collection. This is one of them.

B00B2166BS|4.0|I love the quick disconnect of the magnetic connector. The only issue I have is that the magnets could be a bit stronger. Charges well, and saves my USB connector.
B001XUT6AG|5.0|In 2009 JJ Abrams rejuvinated the Star Trek motion picture franchise. Star Trek Into Darkness is a worthy follow up to the previous films re imagining of the original Star Trek television series with an alternate timeline and young stellar cast playing the iconic original series characters. Star Trek Into Darkness is a well written well directed, well produced, and well acted sci fi action adventure that starts with a bang and masterfully mixes action adventure with intricate story telling and character development.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just finished Wool & am now starting Shift. Hugh Howey is the type of author I love. His characters seem so real - so flesh & blood. The story unfolds gradually but still has hidden mysteries. The Wool omnibus kept me reading & interested until the end. Can't wait to finish Shift & I just ordered Dust to be sure there is something worthwhile reading after I have finished Shift.<br /><br />If you are interested in reading a book that is well written, professionally edited & which has a real plot, I recommend Wool.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Very interesting and unique plot that spins a web that entangled very intriguing characters that were ordinary everyday people.  It really portrayed how one never truly knows the full impact and  reach our choices make.

B001993Y3G|4.0|There are some films that I can seem to watch over and over, this is one of them. Some fun can be made of Kevin Costner's lack of accent, or whatever - but this remains a good, entertaining, action-filled film that I am happy to have in my Bluray collection.<br /><br />With the advent of Bluray, I've been far more discerning in my video purchases, replacing and adding only key movies and tv shows in my collection. This is one of them.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Hello,<br />It's a fine sharpener, plastic bits are much cheaper then I thought they would be, but sharpening bits do their thing very well.<br />It's quite small.<br />The long pointy bit is a great thing as not all knives will fit into the grooves they have.<br />Recommended.
0800141601|5.0|Absolutely the best movie. Eye candy for us ladies! Great story line. Can't help but love Connery & Gere. Bought this from Amazon & have watched so many times - & turned on many friends to this lovely movie.
0740748475|5.0|Really like the way it looks from the outside. The pages and picture quality of the actual books is also really good.<br /><br />The only thing negative I have to say about it is that it can be a little difficult to get the books to slide out of the box they are displayed in.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|Like all of Dan Brown's stories, he writes in a lot of detail.  In the beginning it seemed like a lot of detail could have been eliminated for the average person.  There is a lot of action and that is why I entitled 'it should be a movie' to enhance the action.  It gets better reading as you go farther into the book.  It didn't hold my interest in the beginning thus I was putting off in reading but knowing his books like I do I proceeded on.  I truly reccommend this book but if you want something light don't bother.  Dan Brown goes into depth in all of his writing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a great book i love it<br /><br />And i think you will like it to . Good book after all
B00AEBB9K0|5.0|My wife and I love this movie, and wanted to get a copy for our collection. This fit the bill!
B00CTT9646|5.0|Let me start by saying that the wife and I are fanatics about Star Trek and Star wars! I have been a Gene Roddenberry fan and she a George Lucas one. However, this movie has (and she says this with a smile) brought her to the &#34;dark side&#34;. At first I could not believe my ears but after seeing it twice in the theaters, twice on pay-per-view and once now on DVD...my wife will get ME the popcorn and settle next to me in the couch.<br /><br />This movie (as corny as it sounds) has brought us together! Now for the third installment, let's get Kirk sick as a result of Khan's blood transfusion leaving the Enterprise to eradicate the Klingons and ensue all out war.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow I definitely didn't expect everything that went on in this book but can't wait to read the third book!!! A must read
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|I'm a big Sopranos fan, but even the Sopranos had episodes that were not up to par, but so far not Breaking Bad. Every episode builds on top of the other with no let down.
1250030951|5.0|I was worried about this book when I first got it. Anyone who's involved in fandom has heard it be made fun of. I was afraid of buying a book that would just end up mocking something that's been near and dear to me for ten years now.<br /><br />Those fears, I'm happy to say, were completely unfounded.<br /><br />Cather (Cath), the main character, is someone I could definitely relate to. Awkward, anxious, and more at home online and in the fictional world than anywhere in real life. Not all of her problems were mine - she can't talk to boys and I don't care about talking to them as a lesbian, she feels pressure as a BNF that I've never felt - but even those still felt like something I could understand. She feels isolated at college, especially when her twin sister decides she wants to branch out of the fictional world and find out who she is without Cath by her side.<br /><br />The series Cath and Wren fell in love with, the Simon Snow books, are kind of a stand in Harry Potter in a world that already has Potter. (Though personally the Simon Snow villain actually disturbed me way more than Voldemort.) As much as I wanted Cath to branch out and be happy at school I was scared that doing so would mean accepting that writing fanfiction was stupid and she should abandon something that made her incredibly happy. Happily what it actually meant was finding people who didn't care if she wrote Simon Snow fanfiction or not, even if they didn't understand why she loved it so much.<br /><br />Cath's issues with her fiction-writing teacher over whether fanfiction was a form of plagiarism or not was interesting and Rowell does a great job of describing how so many of us feel about it. That said I loved how she still pushed Cath to write her own original stories and how Cath's fiction-writing final turned out.<br /><br />The romance of the story was very well-written with both sides making mistakes and still accepting the faults in one another and striving to move on. Rowell avoided the dreaded cliche of making another potential or past love interest of the desired boy in question into an enemy. Instead two friends who both have liked (be it at different times) the same guy dealt with it as friends first and foremost, without dragging it in to some awful \\"she's such a backstabbing whore\\" angst-fest.<br /><br />Cath's issues with her mom (and with Wren because of their mom) were incredibly well-written as was her fear for her bipolar father, on his own for the first time now that his girls are off to college.<br /><br />Overall I think that Rowell did an amazing job of highlighting why so many fans, especially young women, turn to fandom and specifically fanfiction, as a way to escape and deal with the lives going on around them. The book showed that there can be a happy balance between the two, neither having to be sacrificed for the other.<br /><br />I highly recommend Fangirl as well as other books by this author.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Just a great story of survival, trust and love.  The unconditional love of an animal is truly a remarkable gift.
1451695195|1.0|Very disappointed.  The title &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; did not go with the contents of book.  Felt I knew less at end of book than when I started.

B008QZ1ZYQ|4.0|We played for hours.  Switching between our younger kids, college kids and adults.  Everyone enjoyed the game.  Great family game.  Challenging and entertaining at the same time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game gives you a touch of the experience of owning a horse. I own my own horse and am a jumper so I find this game very authentic and fun!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A FUN READ.  A LITTLE OVER THE TOP, BUT THAT'S WHAT FICTION IS FOR RIGHT???  IF YOU WANT A FUN READ, GET IT.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I think it must have taken a lot of courage to make this movie, as there are history revisionists today who don't even mention the incident protrayed.  I wasn't aware of it till the movie came out.
B007HVBW2A|5.0|This will make you think.  Scarry and strange to follow it to the end.  I liked its musical background.  This is only the second time I saw it.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It took only five minutes to configure my tv, computer, and phone to the device. Being able to stream videos and movies while being able to check my email is great.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I downloaded the game not expecting much but it really is a great. Fun to play. Liked the control and how you generate money.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|It wasn't enjoyable watching the main character's life slowly fall apart thru the movie.  I wish a smaller portion of the movie was spent on this.  In the end, it left a bad taste in my mouth.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|Very entertaining and fun.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Emma Stone was great as well as an amazing cast of characters.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Fantastic book, but I was confused and disappointed with the ending. I feel it needed more of a cliff hanger if it was going to end the way it did.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Just joking I love it it is fast and fun I am on it all the time you should get it it is soooo addicting I have lost WAIT be cause of it I would keep it up stairs on my bed and I would run a fast as I could up the stairs and see if I got a text I love kik messenger if I were u I would download it NOW!!!!!!
0307279189|5.0|Good read for all running enthusiasts.  Very &#34;now&#34; with all the new five toe, bare-foot-like running shoes being the hot new thing.  Inspirational and informative. A fantastic read.
B004SBQTHU|4.0|I bought it only really having heard three of the songs and that was years ago. I really liked them so I figured why not snag the whole album for a few dollars more. Unfortunately I'm really not in love with the rest of the tracks, that isn't to say they are bad and of course that is entirely subjective.
144233620X|5.0|An absolutely amazing book. It takes you into the mind of someone with Alzheimer's, and gets you to appreciate someone with the disease even more. You understand the step by step deteriation of the mind. A truly emotional story.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Awesome can't wait for the house of Hades fantastic keep it up also the mark of Athena is good to have fun peeps
B00CUHMUZ4|5.0|I love the show... Rieu's performances are enjoyable. However, I must tell you,  there is one distraction in the DVD where it seems something was skipped (bleeped?) and the result is a momentary break in the presentation.
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Spectacular show. Acting it's great keeps you wanting to see the next episode. Can recommend enough a must watch !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby is the bees knees.  I got hooked on it from the 1st episode. I worked in England for 4 years so it was easy for me to follow.  Two thumbs up.
B0046B8GEQ|1.0|The problem was that the movie would not play video through airplay.<br />I wouldn't recommend playing this movie through amazon.
B00004YA66|5.0|I resisted watching &#34;Frequency&#34; for years, but once I took a chance on the film I was hooked for the entire roller-coaster ride. It's a must-own movie.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|This was such an amusing (and quick) read that I didn't notice how long it was until I recommended it to an intermediate level English student.<br /><br />The protagonist is one of those that just happens to be there in key moments of history all over the world due to unlikely circumstances that are artfully woven together into a fun tale. I recommend it if you're looking for a fun read.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Hooked! You just have to know what happens with Jace & Clary (& Simon). I'm 33 years old .....not just an adolescent story.
B006OAB3ME|1.0|The bottom is where this album belongs. If it didn't have McCartney's Name on it no would by it. Great artist proving he can no longer sing.  Don't waist your money
B000PMG16U|5.0|Excellent, now my daughter is a follower too. She started watching and wanted to watch all three the same night.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I think that this is the sort of book best approached with little to no idea what it's about. It's one of, if not Gaiman's most polished book. It's short, yet exactly the length that it needs to be, no more, no less. It's beautiful. Read it.
0375842209|5.0|There are some books that I read and think how fortuitous that this particular piece of literature was recommended by a respected friend.  This is one such book. I'd put it on a list of my favorites.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this calculator a lot, especially during the week. I use it when checking my daughter's homework and also when cooking dinner. We count all our calories and it is super easy to use while doing multiple things.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I loved the movie, it was a 5 star experience. The reason that I'm rating this 1star is because of the poor extra features content on what should be the complete definitive Star Trek Into Darkness experience. What I got isn't worth the premium that I paid to purchase the 3D Blu-ray, pure and simple. Retailers had the opportunity to give incentives to a consumer by offering the Phaser, the Vengeance model, etc., but my expectation is that I would own all of the video content extras by purchasing this set. Not even a commentary??? And no feature on the Vengeance??? This is the type of nonsense that prompts folks to just buy a copy from the guy who comes into the barbershop...
B0063IH60K|4.0|never played solitaire before. It has helped me learn the game. It is nice that I can check on all my options which i miss frequently.<br />I use it as one of my brain exercises.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|Title explains it all. I wished it did work better as I would use my Kindle Fire more, but what's the point if it cant do what it is supposed to?
B004ODLUF8|5.0|I ordered this DVD because I was impressed by it when I first saw it.  I have no doubt that my appreciation for what NASA does will be reinforced each time I view the video, and my ultimate appreciation for God's wonderful creation will only grow with the awesome images.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is more like a movie you must see, but probably only once so I'd recommend a rental.<br />With that said, you will be moved by this film and recommending it left and right to everyone you know!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I'm a light sleeper married to a snider.  The sound mixes are totally relaxing and I now sleep with little trouble.  It also helps me when I have nerve pain from MS.  I put on some beloved sounds from childhood (train, wind chimes, rain on roof) and I can relax.
B005544V6A|5.0|I've watched the entire series on USA and watched the pilot episode here to find out how Mike Ross had passed the bar exam.  Again, I loved it.  This show is original, engaging, and very entertaining.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderfully quirky and believable characters. Falling in love while being terminally ill with the big C  were handled so beautifully by the author! This book will make you laugh and cry.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Google has locked it down so tight at the moment that it just isn't very useful.  Google really wants one to use things like Netflix or Youtube and then stream/cast them not from your tablet or laptop but directly from the internet.  That is ok.  They took away the ability to use sideloaded music (ie music not on google's system or from their store) and took away the ability to cast/stream video from your laptop to the chrome device.  I have Netflix on my devices, I really got Chromecast because it was cheap and for the ability to cast music and video to my television.  Really disappointed, though there is a work around.  If you use the Chrome browser, you can get the google cast extension and simply drag your media to a tap on Google Chrome and hit Cast.  Ok for long local video/movies, not so good as I haven't figured out how to do a play list for music (ie one song at a time is all I can cast).  Also, if you think you can Cast Hulu or Redbox...that won't happen using the work around...google disables casting of stuff that has silverlight and of course there is no Chromecast apps for these and most other services.  Ultimately, it could be a neat thing if Google decides to unlock its potential and/or more apps come out.  Now, it is only 30 bucks but unless you lack the ability to get Netflix any other way or you are a huge user of the Google store for Google Music or Video...I might wait a bit.  The fact I can't cast my itunes or amazon content just turned into a bit of a downer for me.  In addition to no hulu, redbox and other types of movie support.<br /><br />UPDATE - Using google play if I delete all the songs off of my Kindle from the amazon store and then upload them to google play (their cloud) I can then cast them without a problem.  Failing to delete them I get an error (can't play side loaded content).  It kind of stinks that I have to erase the songs from the device for amazon to do this, can't help but think google did this on purpose.<br /><br />Also,someone commented about uninstalling Silverlight.  I will definitely give that a try and see if Hulu and maybe redbox will then cast using flash as opposed to Silverlight.  I would much prefer Hulu and Redbox simply have a cast icon like Netflix and I have heard rumors that this might be coming.  The device really has a lot of potential though I feel like I am being pushed more to the google store and away from the Amazon kindle type store in order to use it.
044042321X|5.0|I will be buying the entire series of the Graphic novels.  I love the books and the TV series and I love this unique perspective an look at the characters and the events happening in the series.  I will probably wait until the whole things catches up and buy them all at once because they're really right RIGHT at the beginning but I can't wait until my shelves are packed with however many of these things they are planning to release.  I probably won't even read them, I will buy them on my iPad to read them I just have to own the hard copies.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|It has some minor compatibility issues, especially if you are using things like automatic number or table of contents for your documents.  However, if you are using it for some light document editing on the road it sure as heck beats lugging around the laptop.  I am a bit of a writer and the book I am finishing is hundreds of pages long.  It is a bit annoying that the TOC doesn't work right and takes some time to get to where I am working on (I write all over the place in the story till it is done, just how I do it).  My solution to the draw back of the saved documents screwing up the Table of Contents (&#34;TOC&#34;) is to start a new separate file and write in that and simply merge the file into the document on my laptop at a later date.  Ultimately, while not perfect it is a great little suite for a tablet and with the Amazon Basic Keyboard and a Kindle Fire HD it is downright almost like having your laptop with you for office projects.  Anyway, it really helps me avoid lugging around the lap top.  I also use Excel quite a bit to keep track of financial information, and this comes in really handy for that as well.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|I was not disappointed.  What a book - I can't believe this was written so long ago.  You will not be disappointed.
0143037757|3.0|I managed to get a used library copy  (cheap). I just finished reading this massive account of Europe from 1945 to 2005. I found two clear errors: The plane captured in Entebbe with a Lufthansa plane, not form Air France. Number two was the name \\"Krenze\\" which should be \\"Krenz\\". Other than these, I am very impressed, but I am made aware that Judt was a Zionist, worked on behalf of Israel,was a communist sympathizer and then a socialist. He turned against all of these, so I conclude that what Judt knows best he is very critical of. However, my memory of Europe agrees with his version of history (more or less)
B006W0QR1S|1.0|Watching this movie was like watching a motionless picture of its two main characters for an hr.  The number of dramatic pauses where nothing was said, and nothing happened, was painful.  The characters had about as much depth to them as a kiddie pool.  For the love of all that is good in this world, please do not waste your time on this movie!!!!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It is a must to get the most out of your Kindle Fire HD.  I use it to explore the file system and it has been an invaluable tool for helping to get the most out of my Kindle Fire HD.  In addition, it makes moving files from my PC to my Kindle easy, the video player and such is helpful, but ultimately it is sort of like a working version of windows explorer for your adroid based device.  The full version is great.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Believable, even the bad guys are human, with a few redeeming qualities, no gore, very little sex, but intelligent, tightly directed, sets done to the last detail. Love this show....
B005UG542S|5.0|The movie was great, good quality picture too. Loved the books and I loved that the movies are are so close to the books.
B00B1LRBPO|3.0|This is a soundtrack, so what you get are some relatively short mood-evoking pieces that don't go anywhere.  I like Mogwai a lot and have several of their previous recordings but this doesn't compare.  Skip this one and wait for their next real recording.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Thought this book series was great!  Cant wait for book number 4 to come out!<br />LOVE LOVE LOVE it !

1416955070|5.0|Loved the book and the surprise ending. The book was in good condition as well. I will definitely be reading the rest of the series.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love this game but it is full of glitches,that really frustrate you. Twice I have been quite high up the leadership board and,with only 24 hours to go, all my rank points disappear and instead of winning 3000 tokens, I`m lucky if I get 10. The game freezes a lot saying I have lost server connection but my internet is fine. That loses you tokens. However, being competitive, I persevere and have complained to game loft about issues. Hope they get resolved soon. My advice? Only play using free scratch tokens. That way when your game freezes you haven`t lost money.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Dark and disturbing but somehow great fun like the rest of her books. The only bad news is that I'm out of Gillian Flynn novels.<br />Hope she comes out with another one soon!
B004IPPINW|4.0|I liked the writer's style of writing everything from the protagonist's perspective.  It fit the theme of the book.  The ending was a bit of a surprise.  This book gives you some things to think about.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Don't know why kept reading.  Knew what final chapter was going to be, but continued to read.  Started out exciting but finished just the way I feared.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Love this drama with David Tennet and all the other actors doing a fantastic job!  The story covers one investigation of a murder and so is a true serial.  I'm always disappointed with the end of each episode because I want to know more.  If you never watched British TV, this is a great one to try.  I find that the British treat their audiences as if they actually can think.  Very refreshing point of view compared to US TV.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|I like it too much, It's very interesantig, I recomendad it for all of you that are looking for some differente pointdocuments of view.
030758836X|2.0|But I did finish it to see the ending, which was not a surprise.  This book will make a good movie, however.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|...but too much of a jump between. 9500 and 35000 in the shop...like the power ups...fluffy. very fluffy. need more though...
B00D3LA5WG|1.0|I didn't watch MUD completely through.  Lost interested and hated the graphic violence.  Wished I had not spent the money to own this.  Bought based on stardom.  Poor choice.
B000FC0ZAI|5.0|I think I will remember this book for a long time. It is beautifully written, sometimes the writing makes me yell out loud, and I just love it. I stopped reading at one point because it seemed to go on and on with too much Alaska, and I'm so glad I picked it up again. It's weird and quirky and it's hard to really like the main characters, especially the male ones, but I have to give it four and a half stars because I can't think of any book more deserving.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Really great movie would be Tarantinos best since pulp fiction would recommend as one of the best of the year
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is addicting and fun! its good for children and adults. I cant help. but to play everyday . great great game!
B00AQF8CJ0|4.0|The &quot;please review&quot; box popped up after playing the first world, so this review is from a lesser perspective.<br /><br />First, this game is alot like sokoban without edges, but more fun because it has pudding with special properties, like green slime that stops your standard red pudding from going off the edge of the board. So it's like a combo of CTR and sokoban.<br /><br />Second, I like how the game worlds are organized, from the refridgerator to the world outside. Not as random as CTR (experiments) and adds a story type element to an otherwise puzzle only game.<br /><br />Third, this game is fun.  That is all.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|I had a blood pressure of 150/80 and my doctor advised me to take medication to reduce it. I resisted taking medication and instead told him I will exercise to bring the blood pressure down. After a year of regular exercise, the blood pressure was still elevated. So I decided to follow his advise to take medication. Taking medication brought side effects such as dry cough and allergies. So my doctor advised me to take other medications for the cough and allergies. After five years of medications and coughing, I bought this book and decided to use apple/celery/carrot/ mint combination juice every day. Amazingly my blood pressure drop to 120/70 after two weeks. I stopped all medications and kept monitoring my blood pressure at the same time. Somehow my blood pressure stabilized at 120/70. My allergies and cough greatly diminished. In fact I can honestly say I am free from allergies after a month of drinking prepared juices.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The Chromecast is perfect for a second TV where full cable not needed. Will only get better as more services are included.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I found I cared about and liked the characters. I do think this was the weaker book in the series and hope it gets better.
B0089LOG02|5.0|My grandmother was adopted, her story is much like those on the orphan train.<br />They also gave information on places to contact for more information, I have been trying<br />to research and locate her birth family and this helped with some leads.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|There are some movies everyone knows about and there are some very few know about so you want to show your friends.  This is the latter of the two.  While many have probably heard of it, fewer have actually seen it ...and the ones that have usually love it.<br /><br />While I found the ending to be exactly what I predicted the journey there was fresh and exhilarating.  Normaly the hero and bad guy of the story is well defined, and movies typically color within the lines.  But this movie paints a story of everyone who deserves to win for a change and by the end you wonder if anyone truly won what they were expecting to win.<br /><br />It's a great movie with great acting and characters that I liked.  I couldn't tell you who the hero or the bad guy was but I will say the fights are rough ...and I'm not just talking about the fight scenes.<br /><br />If you want a good movie to add a little more depth to your library, this is a good one.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|The book keeps you guessing and over all very satisfying ! I loved it and I know others will too!
B00D5LC4GY|3.0|This game is ok, the concept is good, but the execution needs polishing. spelling errors, mapping of controls, etc.<br /><br />The review above mentions bad permissions. I must have downloaded a different app because my permissions aren't as nefarious.<br /><br />I will say that the same app on google pl@y has a different author listed. Why? I have no idea. Seems odd. Foreign programmers.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This alarm clock is great I found it easy to set up and the first time it went off it was so enjoy able to wake to a tune thank you for sweet way to wake up the temperature feature is also a great way to start the day
B00BTYJYOE|5.0|\\"Actions speaking louder than words\\" is the benchmark of what Alfred Hitchcock would label pure cinema. THE HUNTED is a dramatic tour de force of pure cinema. Tommy Lee Jones as the \\"hunter\\" and Benicio Del Toro as the \\"hunted\\" are perfectly cast and deliver frightenedly realistic performances. William Friedkin's direction disposes any hint of a smooth narrative flow. Instead Friedkin relies on the strengths of his two leads to interpret the strange camaraderie that exists between the man who teaches to kill and the man who will not stop killing. The teacher and the viewer know that there is only one way to stop the pupil. The opening of the film suggests that Del Toro has become traumatized by the inhumanity he witnesses in Kosovo and an extermination we see him carry out in that war zone. Now Del Toro has started killing hunters in the northwest forests and Jones must reluctantly agree to stop him. I really liked Del Toro's performance because he does not seem to be a man traumatized by bloodshed but instead needs a purpose to continue practicing the skills that he is so ever proficient at. I equally liked Tommy Lee Jones' performance because he instinctively knows of this primal need that Del Toro must satisfy. The minimal plot and other characters in this film are only synergist elements to set the stage for Jones and Del Toro. Strangely the viewer identifies with Del Toro's character because we only see him kill those that extinguish life. They take life without really questioning the overall purpose of the system of right and wrong that has been created here on earth. Jones too is an instrument to that end which we can not truly fathom.
B00DI75SWM|5.0|Love this app-works really great and its really fun-good job people<br />lots and lots of fun<br />thanks so much! Thanks
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|It seems to be a well researched book. I have always been interested in religion even though I am not a person of faith. I feel the history of those turbulent times in the Middle East are not unlike the times we live in now; wars, religious intolerance, poverty and illiteracy, cruelty , occupation by powerful nations.
B00D2ZF3GQ|1.0|I thought that I would never see another movie as bad as \\"Battlefield Earth\\". Yet there it is, another movie that just had the word \\"Nepotism\\" written across the screen! It is hard to get past the fact that it was clearly made to launch an acting career for his son. It really is a tribute to just what money and power can truly do in Hollywood. I like Will Smith's acting, but there was very little of it here. His son was just awful to the point that you have to ask \\"Why is he there?\\" I will say this much for the movie, if you have trouble going to sleep. Watch this with some \\"Sleepytime Tea\\" and you will fall fast asleep in no time. As a movie to watch, I have to say \\"no\\"! As a Sleep-Aide I would say \\"yes\\"!
B001KEXEOE|5.0|MYSTIC RIVER is one of director Clint Eastwood's better films. The story told through unforgettable imagery is mesmerizing and leaves the viewer's mind in a subterfuge of disturbing what-if images. This is a downbeat yet powerful soul-searching parable of anyone who ever must face cryptic circumstances, memories and destiny. Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, and Kevin Bacon are truly extraordinary in their roles. Tim Robbins showed greater depth as an actor than I ever thought possible. He was entirely believable and convincing. His performance was just heartbreaking. Sean Penn's performance was brilliant. Under his tough-guy persona lurked a man of compassion yet one who could not give up his eye-for-an-eye upbringing. Kevin Bacon gave a stoic performance of a man who could not yet comprehend his past experiences and put them in perspective, nor could he admit to what was evident in his present challenge because he was blinded by the past. I believe that the performances really drive this film. There is a certain amount of reality in them that makes this film come down on a personal level. This is a very moving film and one that lingers with you.
B002GHIPYI|4.0|Yes, I've ordered more than one just so I can always have one at hand. The reason I started ordering these is because I grew tired of replacing other more expensive units that broke easily. I get these for my FoH sound people at church and are practically indestructible under light use. I don't know how well they sound in comparison with other more expensive ones. I don't know how well they isolate noise. I do not care. I've gotten these strictly because of their value and quality of construction.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|We have really enjoyed all the Resident Evil movies, it is a matter of what you enjoy.  But we did like this movie.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One word..................Beautiful................dialogue, costumes, location, story, characters, actors.  Initially had no interest in the series but watercooler talk made it irresistible to at least give it a try.  So glad I did.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I had high hopes for this device but resigned to the fact that its nowhere close to what I was looking for.<br /><br />1) It does not support 5Ghz N-network therefore I would have to switch between networks on my devices to get to it. (AppleTV supports it)<br />2) There is a mini-USB input to connect it to power sticking out from the back.  Apparently its not capable of powering from HDMI port on latest TVs.<br />3) Only supports 2 applications  (AppleTV has far more)<br />4) No remote (All other streaming devices do)
1400052181|5.0|Skloot takes you inside the characters of this excellent book.  All of her research has paid off in a most readable and rewarding book.  HOORAY FOR HELA!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Not a bad movie, it did entertain us for a couple of hours. Different not seeing Matt Damon in a Bourne movie. All in all pretty good.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a lovely light read, evocative of a time gone by. I enjoyed the light humour, but also as an ex Catholic recognised the truthfullness of the cruel and vindictive treatment dished out to the main character as a child.<br />The ending had a lovely twist that I did see coming, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment of this charming book. I have just purchased another by this author that promises to be just as good.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I found this book to be slow at times and couldn't wait for it to finally get to the action. I also found it hard to follow sometimes and was disappointed at how the final battle turned out. But, I loved how it all wrapped up and I got the happy ending I was waiting for.
0788858408|5.0|Each chapter, each game, each hole was better than the one before.  There is more than gold, here.  As a famous coach once said, &#34;giving your all, it seems to me, is no so far from victory!&#34;  Frost and Francis gave it their all!
B00AA7O22U|5.0|We love action movies and this one has all that and more. Love the characters too. Most times your disappointed with the 2nd, not so here, but I guess you need to like these kind of movies.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|i really was taking a chances with this cd.  when i was a little younger i would invest in artist and hope i would found something within their music that moved me.  this cd was cool and the music is nice!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book covers what happened after the games and but not in to much detail. It jumps into a few months after the games and the victory tour. I was eager to see how Katniss ended up back in the arena since I saw the previews for the 2nd movie. I loved to see her change to wanting to protect Peeta to realizing how she feels for him. It was the first time I was torn and wanting her to end up with Peeta.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Quality is good despite being old but the transfer is well done.  Can't compete with the video quality of a recent movie but definitely good enough
B009NQKPUW|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, although my daughter told us not to waste our money.  I guess it is all a matter of what you like or not.
B002BJGYU8|5.0|Condition as described, love this series just needed to replace an old dvd that was worn from too much watching of the show.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love love love the Crossfire series!! Very passionate and addictive! I can't wait for the last 2 books to be published!
B000NTPDSW|4.0|A must have in a great packaging saving space on your shelf and better quality than the regular DVDs Sound also much better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love to pin recipes, gardening ideas, DIY' s and other interests. It's a great way to share ideas, make new friends
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|So I TRIED to watch this item via online streaming and nothing showed up.  What is worse, trying to find a place to complain about this or ask for help is nearly impossible.  I am greatly reconsidering my prime account since I just wasted money on a movie I couldn't see.  Thanks a lot Amazon.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Loved it. - I've watched it over and over again, after seeing it at the movies first.  Yea.<br /><br />M (Denver)
B00F35BV64|3.0|Anymore I have found Hollywood repeating the same themes.  Hollywood seems to rely heavily on computer generated action scenes.  The plot of this movie is a typical plot development.  Did you know that in the past few years Hollywood has been relying on writing academies to write scripts.  The plots are so cookie cutter, losing originality, and constantly putting in the same plot elements repeatedly.  I do not like the movies coming out of Hollywood because they seem so dry in imagination.  Where are the days when movies were inspired by great authorship and imagination.  Has Hollywood dried up in truly imaginative films because their audience is willing to be entertained by simplistic stories.  We need a more thoughtful art form not a reliance on the easy, lazy content.  My favorite Science Fiction movie is the 'The Forbidden Planet'.  The technical sets may seem rather old fashion, but the plot is fascinating.  'The Forbidden Planet' is still rated for 5 stars.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|great graphics. time consuming. better than x box or play station. once started the game.hard to put down. a players must game
B005544V6A|4.0|As good as the two main characters (Gabriel Macht and Patrick J. Adams) are on &#34;Suits,&#34; the ensemble boosts this show to an even higher level. Gina Torres as the head of the law firm, Rick Hoffman playing a stereo-typical smarmy lawyer, hot para-legal Meghan Markle and Sarah Rafferty as a partner secretary make for very entertaining viewing.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It just needs some time to 'learn' from your type of writing.<br />Connect it with Facebook and other apps and it becomes a very good app with perfect next word prediction.<br />Not a very accurate swiping method though.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|sad story, that allows you to reflect on your own mortality, and what do you want to leave in this world?
B00846REIS|5.0|I enjoyed all 3 books and look forward to the 4th book. I felt the story line was much stronger than Fifty shades. You should read it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.
B00BL5YQKS|5.0|Some might call them dirty cops. I think of them as effective. With the exception of what happens to Terry, they walk a fine line.<br /><br />I don't typically watch cop shows but this one got me when it was on FX. Now I'm on my third time through the series.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|There is something about the Weather channel app.  I review the Weather daily, whether my weather changes or not. I can't get enough if it.  Yea, the changes/advertisement s take some getting use too, but it's worth it to get to this app
B00F35B8F8|3.0|thus was a decent movie but not great.  send to focus to much on special effects and not enough on plot.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|lacking in oroginality, boring, poorly written.<br />The characters actions and choies were not reasonable for professionals.  The dialogue was trite.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Loved the book. Saw the movie and felt intrigued. Good book. Takes you very far away and then very near.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|For me it was a very great read recommend to any and all who enjoys a page turner. I have enjoyed it tremendously.<br />Excited about the next one! So tell me readers, where should I go next?
B00EVU3S4U|4.0|\\"There's no backstabbing here, it's just business.\\" Christine (McAdams) and Isabelle (Rapace) are ad executives who have friendly relationship. After coming up with a great ad idea for jeans Isabelle is sent to London to pitch it. When it becomes a hit and is picked up Christine takes the credit. This event begins a chain reaction of trying to one up the other that quickly spirals out of control. I have been watching as many movies as I can without seeing the trailer first, that way I have no preconceived expectations. That said knowing Noomi Rapace was in this and Brian De Palma directed this I was excited. I was not disappointed at all. De Palma is the master of the erotic thriller and he again proves why with this movie. The beginning is a little slow but you will be glad you stuck with it. Because I watch so many movies I am getting very good at predicting how a movie will play out. This is one that was consistently one step ahead of me and as soon as I thought I knew what was going on I was proved wrong. To me that is what makes a good movie, being surprised with how it will go keeps you watching and wondering. I am very surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I highly recommend this. I give it an A-.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I believe that this is a very realistic portrayal of abuse and neglect in church sponsored institution. It makes me angry to think that this kind of abuse occurred by people who should have been more morally centered in their own religious lives. No wonder there is lack of trust and faith in church institutions.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I have bought several of the series, this is very colorful and very challenging. I'ts good they have the help on line
B0040I09RM|5.0|The best show ever, hands down! Can't wait to watch season 2! And 3! And 4! And 5! And 6!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Great cast, storyline, and direction. I didnt start watching until the middle of season 2. Now Im all caught up and it is the best tv show during the summer!
B006IND5M8|4.0|I picked this movie because I was in the mood for something silly. Cowboys & Aliens sounded silly. But I was really surprised by the movie. It wasn't silly to begin with, and they actually made it work. What I liked was they didn't go into too much detail on what the heck they were, because not too many people I would think, would believe in aliens in that time period. I don't want to say why the aliens were here or what happens ... so if you watch this, I think you will enjoy it. Not silly, very serious, and most of all, it works.
B00004WXAA|5.0|I had to have it on vinyl.<br />Ms. Hill is a lovely human being and this album illuminates that. The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill album carries so much weight in each track; her rhymes are powerful and meaningful and more real than 98 percent of female rappers in the spotlight today. I suggest it to any true music fan out there in the world. If you have not given it a solid listen you my friend are missing out.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great acting. Great action and wonderful suspense. Wonderful way of revitalizing the best of the old Star Trek series by bringing Khan back to life. Of course, the first and second movies have given us the back stories of our favorite characters and shows us the evolution of their friendships and hardships. Chris Pine's performance makes me forget William Shatner.
1405048018|2.0|I ordered this thinking I would get a cassette AND a book...basically a read-along book. All I received was a cassette tape!! I paid $30 for a TAPE. Not only is that a rip off but I have played it 4 times and the lady's voice is getting deeper and deeper. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? My $30 something tape is already worn out. OMG...I will NEVER order from this company again. Total rip off!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was hands down one of the best books I have read! It was powerful, hilarious, thought provoking, inspiring, romantic and heartbreaking. It was extremely well written and you felt a real connection to the characters. It was my first John Green novel and definitely won't be my last!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|One of the best action movies in a long time. Predictable? Sure.  Formulaic? Of course. But still a great piece of comic book entertainment for the big screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read the hunger games many times but Catching fire is the best one yet!! Praise Suzanne Collins for an incredible masterpiece...
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is amazing because this has a very nice educational system and it helped me a lot during my homework and it helps my sister
B004MYF4SS|5.0|i just can't get enough of this mans' work!  this is the first book of the lewis trilogy, so read it first - you won't be disappointed - the journey will be exciting and fulfilling - am about to embark on 'the chessmen', but i am putting it off because i don't know what i'll do afterwards, as i think that is all - after all, it is a 'trilogy'.  more please peter!!!!!!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very fun even on the first few rounds. Lots of different cars and tracks.  I am having fun with the tractor on the different tracks.<br /><br />Have Fun
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I got this book for my Kindle on a recommendation of the DJ Gatsby Book Club (DJGBC) on FB, and a book discussion that was coming up with the author.  I was very pleasantly surprised. This book will give you a new outlook on poetry.  The book is very sensual...romantic is not the right word for it.  It will show you that not all erotica is just raw sex.  The way The G.P.A. writes, it seems as though you get a good look into what he is like as a person.  When I was done with this book, it left me wanting to read more by The G.P.A.  I have a whole new view on poetry.  I look forward to reading more work by The G.P.A. and hope to see him read live one day.  Read on!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is a lot of fun. At first I thought it was stupid, but when I got to 7 by 7 it got more fun.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great account of the Osama bin Laden Raid. It was amazing to find the many details revealed that had been scrubbed and cleared by censors.  Thank you so much!
B003CH9PTU|5.0|We started watching season one on DVD after it had been on a few seasons.  My husband and I sat over a weekend and watched every episode.  Once we started, we could not stop.  There is 3 shows until the series finale right now, and we are so sad!  I've never been this addicted to a television show in my life.  The writing, acting, and plot are absolutely brilliant.  I am re-watching every episode!  And yes, I do have a life!  Start with season one, and don't miss an episode!
1874703485|1.0|The first half of the book looked like it might get somewhere. WRONG. Pretentious and academic double talk. Possibly if I were a stoned out beatnik of the 50's I could find some passaged to sound hip. Or some college professor assigning this as a sophomore book assignment to spend a semester exploring all the hidden meanings. As far as being of value, don't waste your time.[[ASIN:0553277472 Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry into Values]]
