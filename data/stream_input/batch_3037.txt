B00CATSONE|2.0|An interesting short read, but takes many stories of Tesla at face value, even those with little to no (or even negative) evidence.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|good game but i don't like the fact i have to rate the game just so i can keep playing it.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Simple notepad but very useful to make quick lists.  I am using right now to keep track of Christmas shoping.  You can change the background color and the type is quite large and easy to see.  I like it so far.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The plot thickens in season 2! I love the intense drama. Highly recommended for people who love law shows but don't take things too seriously.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|This CD is relatively short compared to others and has some of the good songs from season 1 on it but not all.  It does have the ones I was wanting the most and I've enjoyed listening to it.
B008220BP2|5.0|I typically don't care for zombie movies (unless they are a comedy like Shaun of the Dead) but this movie wasn't the typical zombie movie. The cast did an excellent job. The movie was funny as hell, had a good plot and the love story was one that even guys can enjoy.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It had been many years since the first time I read this and I enjoyed it and was just as entertained.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|I just love Emma Thompson, she is and will always be one of my most favorite actress's and since she wrote the screenplay for both the Nanny McPhee movies, I feel I know her alittle better than I did from just seeing her in Sense and Sensibility (which is another one of my favorite movies with her in it.. not to mention seeing her in Harry Potter, which I loved her in that too!)  She is a great actress and I will always think the best of her..
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|You gotta be kidding me! This writer intends to continue this story in another book? I think she is getting greedy. There is absolutely no reason why this story could not have been ended in book 3.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It was hard to put this book down!  I could never figure out what was going to happen---it really kept my interest!  I loved it!!
6305922756|1.0|The DVD did NOT work when we opened it.  It was for a corporate event and we were hugely disappointed since it didn't play at all and we had built a whole event around it.
080419257X|5.0|Just a great historical manuscript,  its quite unreal how ignorant I am of ancient history,  esp when it comes to its exponential brutality.  Am still wondering how the teachings of jesus became a Roman religion.  Humans are the cruelest of all species.  Just read that crucifixen is used in sudan.  No words for how ashamed i am to be human, at times.
1451695195|2.0|I was really excited about this book but sadly disappointed. I was expecting it to be more about his after life experience instead of his career.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It is fun, addictive, and easy to play. You rush along a railway track dodging trains and barriers, even running on top of the trains, to get away from the cop and his dog. You collect coins to buy upgrades and boosts, and there are daily missions and goals. The greatest thing I have discovered is that, unlike other similar games I have played, this one isn't the same pattern over and over. It changes each time you play it so that you don't just memorize the pattern. It keeps you on your toes and is a great game!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is the best game I have ever played! little monsters is 1 star; 0 stars if possible.<br />if u dislike dragonvale. boy/girl, u r craazy!
0060919760|5.0|I love this book. It really illuminates some of the behaviors we adopt as we age, that we may not ever be aware of. It gives you great suggestions on how to overcome negative thought traps and self damaging behavioral habits. It helped me realize and change the things about myself that were not desirable, and, more importantly, that were keeping me from living to my fullest, happiest potential. Straight forward, no BS style of writing really cuts to the core. Love it.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|The acting is great and some people I know really liked the political wrangling throughout, but other than the very good acting, I was bored to death.  Obviously the critics liked it a lot.  But not I.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have loved the series, and this was a fantastic read. You get a lot of resolution to some issues that went on in prior books. I highly recommend this one, and can't wait for the next.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This heart-wrenching story will stay with me for a long time!  The tragedy survived by Jamie would be insurmountable by most and made me love this character all the more!  Heartwarming people and events wove their way in and around Jamie's life, keeping my hopes up as I cheered him on. I will not spoil the ending - enjoy this author's gift of writing!  My only hesitation while reading the story was the horrible portrayal of the nuns in the orphanage. I know that the world has it's share of cruel and demented people, but it is hard to believe there weren't any loving caretakers in the orphanage.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for some time for candy crush to be available on my kindle fire. My friends have been raving about it. Now I can join them with the addiction of the crush.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This was a great book with a lot of action! Eeek, so much going on, I couldn't put it down!!
B000FBJAEG|5.0|I chose this book because I have read almost all his books.  It is always interesting to see how the book will end and see how close I can come to solving the mystery.
B001NLL93W|5.0|This book took a twist and was different from the first two. A lot of information was revealed and you learn even more about the characters. I should've stopped with this book and thought about my own plot, but I read book 4-bummer!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Went I go to place I can take photos easier and went something is happening I can just tap the app and then tap to take the photo and there you go
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|After the first couple of chapters it really started to pick up. The author had to establish the characters and plot, which took some time and I was a little bit impatient!
1573226521|4.0|I liked this book a lot and was not disappointed with the condition. I paid practically nothing for it and got to read an exciting story. Kudos!
B008GGA5EQ|5.0|True, the idea of bondage can be triggering or disturbing.<br />Her book \\"A Girl's Adventure\\" is resoundingly set in contemporary London. A young woman takes an erotic risk. In \\"GA\\", that risk is to speak to the stranger who has made eye-contact on a subway.<br />\\"A Girl's Trade\\" begins with another young woman vacationing in the Azores who takes a nude swim to a near-by island.<br />It's after that immersion (pun, yes) that worldly details like race and nation become purposefully vague or fanciful, bringing us to experience the frisson without risk.<br />The rest of the story is much like \\"GA\\" in structure: an initial fervid bang, a humiliation, then being brought into a brash culture of sensuality. The girl is a hostage, but like a daydream, that captivity presses without becoming fearful.<br />BUT you ask IS IT HOT?<br />Yes it is. The language is neither flowery nor overly profane. The sex is direct, to the point, and crotch tightening. Nice imagery is filed away for future personal use.<br /><br />I did this review with the understanding that the author would be similarly honest in reviewing a book which I edited.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|Great serie, this is the most emotive season of all. I loved it but you need to see all the previos seasons. The effects as allways are great.
B0029OYPLK|5.0|This would have been an amazing concert to be at, and this CD is second best to that.  Incredible musicians.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|It is sometimes comfortable to use this. The general situation that thus function is available everywhere makes it less a Kindle winner.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|This game is the best historic SIM I  ever played and I recommend it my self for u to play
B00BKTFABE|3.0|If this had a forward view it would be great. The back only view is awkward to use to take images of what you see.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|this season is the worst season of dexter. I am simply contemplating on even buying it. I own every season of dexter 1 through 7 and may purchase this simply to complete my collection. in my opinion this season is slow, boring, and doesn't make you feel like you are watching the original dexter. if you are not a big dexter fan I wouldn't purchase this season. I recommend seasons 1 through 4 if you are not big on dexter or just starting to watch.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|Love the movie, and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because There is No way they could bring back the series without the crew member that did not make it in this movie. Bad move! :(
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is the best movie I've seen in years.  The plot is complex yet has a lot of depth to it; the characters are solid; and the villain is smooth, intelligent and very manipulative.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of good i clips or J.J. Abrams' work.
1476727651|5.0|Love the new characters and villians. Rose the Hat is a great new character. Wished it would have focused on Danny a little more, but still an awesome read!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Everyone should see it!<br />I wish I had an HD tho.<br />the pic would have been that much better for sho.
034580709X|4.0|Great book, I've read al all of his  books so far, Jo Nesbo, and find them compelling. He is a different detective. That is what makes the stories so interesting. We started because we saw a movie of one of his stories.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|At first I wasn't sure I liked the format but once into it I liked it.  From reading accounts from survivors, both Jewish and German I think the account is accurate.  I loved the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The trilogy was a fantastic read. I can't wait for the movie!!<br />Great job E L James! :) And, cannot wait for your next book. I hope you have one in the works!
B004BSFSTA|5.0|works great, sound is very good for rock - punk music, nice design, proper quality for the price<br />great packaging<br />no issues
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I don't understand the negative reviews. This works great for me and I find it very useful to know the amount of time I have left for various applications, reading on my kindle and GPS on my phone in particular.  Maybe this app conflicts with some other apps, but not the kindle os (Android). I wonder if one or more of the negative reviews was written by a competitor who has a similar product.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|This app was realy fun.  My brother also enjoys this app.we both have to play this game at least ones a day for our sake.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love candy crush! some apps are fun to play but get boring after awhile. but this app has over 400 levels and get more difficult as you go. im always playing it where ever i go. if i flunk college i blame it on candy crush hehe ;)
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Glad this is finally available to Kindle users.  Really like the ability to interact with other players.  Fast paced and lots of action.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|OMG!!!  I just love Candy Crush Saga, I can spend hours playing this game.  Now that I have it on my Kindle Fire, I am be side myself.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon for finally  getting this game on Kindle Fire.<br />  Five stars !!!!!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Liked it the first time around. Had to read it again before the movie comes out. Can't wait for the screen version !!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Heard my young co-workers talking about this game so I thought I would give it a try. Addictive thank goodness not so much that I actually spend money!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game I am so happy it came to the kindle fire hd you should get this amazing game it looks so real
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|From previous reviews it seemed like the right choice. Just started but I am used to this type of game play and hopefully can play without spending any real cash. Look forward to the interesting levels.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addicting! But i love it so much. I can't ever get off . Bunches of levels. But can be aggravating.
B00AXOPK6W|5.0|Jane Austen was very good at what she did.  This is a really wonderful read. It is a \\"chick read\\" no doubt, but curl up in front of the fireplace and prepare to be to be captured.  Ms Austen does not indulge in words just to fill up a page, her stories are concise and move right along to keep you engrossed and involved and waiting eagerly for the next paragraph.  It may be from an historical era we thankfully did not have to be a part of but it is victorious.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game very addictive though,but I can't seem to connect to Facebook everyone I try to send a request to a friend for lives it says can't connect . I even called Amazon & they tried to help but it still won't work. Frustrated :(
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This works beautifully!  I am so glad that they finally have the Kindle Fire HD app for Candy Crush!!  Links seamlessly with Facebook!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app is good my mom took my phone because hers was about to be trim of so I used you app 're help me thanks
B00DBR8A60|2.0|Looks great in the pictures. In person looks cheap. I would have kept it if it was half the price.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|:) ready for updates so I can continue to escape. Love that it works my mind. Love love loved it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! Its addicting and defiantly five star worthy. Its even better that its free. My only complaint is that it takes a while for it to load when you update it but after that its really fast and amazing. I HIGHLY recommend buying this app!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|this app is not good. You must send your file to HP before it is printed and once you send it to the cloud it is there forever.  I don't care what the vendors say, you have no control once it goes to the cloud.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This program is absolutely addictive and just when you think things are going well misery strikes again.  I can't wait for the new season to start.
B008B11R1Q|4.0|Probably like most people here, I fell for The XX's debut album, intrigued by the mix of minimalism and suggested beats. I saw the band perform at Coachella when they were touring in support of the debut album, and I think that co-founders/singers Oliver Sims and Romy Madley Croft were as surprised with the massive crowd reaction as anyone. Now comes the band's highly anticipated second album.<br /><br />\\"Coexist\\" (11 tracks; 37 min.) starts off with \\"Angels\\", a very quiet and minimalist track, as if we were dropped straight halfway into an album. \\"Chained\\" is slightly more beat-oriented. The first song on here that truly peaks my interest is \\"Try\\", one-third into the album. \\"Sunset\\" is another intriguing tune. But let's be honest: most of the songs on here are introverted, pensive and moody. If that is what you are ready for, then this album is for you. For those that write that \\"Coexist\\" picks up where the debut album left off, I respectfully disagree. The XX had a choice to make with this second album: stick to the tried-and-true formula of the debut album, go for even more dance-oriented material, or make a left turn altogether and become more introspective. The band chose the latter direction, and that's fine. Sometimes I'm in the mood for something like this. But \\"Coexist\\" is NOT \\"The XX 2\\".<br /><br />Last weekend I saw The XX in concert at the Corona Capital music festival in Mexico City (the Mexican equivalent of Coachella). Once again., the live set was outstanding. The band divided their set evenly between the two albums (playing 8 tracks from each), and I must tell you that each one of the 8 tracks from \\"Coexist\\" sounded so much better (bigger, harder, more thrilling) live than it does on the album. If you have a chance to see The XX in concert, do not miss them!
B005LAIIMG|5.0|If you are looking for a good scary movie for Halloween, this might be the best choice.  You will be rivited to your seat in suspension for most of the movie.  The Z stands for Zombie, though they have another name for them in the movie.  Not as much blood and gore as you might expect, but the film doesn't need it.  Go Brad Pitt!!!
B009PLO2RW|4.0|\\"Haute Cuisine\\" (95 min.; 2012 release from France; original title \\"Les Saveurs du Palais\\" or \\"The Flavors of the Palace\\") brings the fictionalized story of Dani&egrave;le Delpeuch who served as the personal cook of President Mitterand in the late 80s/early 90s. As the movie opens, the Delpeuch character is portrayed as Hortense Laborie, a chef from the Perigord region in south-central France, who apparently is now stationed in the Crozet Islands near Antarctica, where she is cooking for a small community of scientific researchers. We then go back in time as we see how 4 years earlier, she had gotten a call out of the blue from a top French bureaucrat that a \\"senior French official\\" wanted to hire her as his personal cook. When she eventually finds out that the position is to cook for the President of France, she wonders how he had gotten her name. In a later meeting President Mitterrand tells her that she came highly recommended by a close friend of his who had seen her cooking at some point. The rest of the movie cuts back and forth between her days as the Elysee Palace and the Crozet Islands, but focuses mainly on the tensions between Laborie and the much larger Main Kitchen crew also operating at the Elysee palace. To tell you much more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: the movie mentions not once, but twice (both in the opening credit and the closing credits), that it is 'loosely' based on the life of Dani&egrave;le Delpeuch, probably the reason why the main character is named differently, and perhaps also why the President in the movie looks nothing like Francois Mitterand. If you can get beyond this, the movie becomes a light-hearted French foodie comedy-drama, where indeed the French cuisine becomes the star of the movie, and the interoffice politicking between the President's personal cook and the Main Kitchen are just minor things in the big picture (at one point the regular Desert Chef blows up because he feels threatened and insecure, imagine that!). I am not a foodie as such, yet I couldn't help but marvel at all these French regional dishes. The role of Dani&egrave;le Delpeuch/Hortense Laborie is played beautifully by Catherine Frot, who deservedly was nominated for a Best Actress Cezar (the French Oscars). At just an hour and a half, this movie flew by in no time.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when this movie showed up unannounced and without any prior hype or advertising at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati last weekend. I was traveling then and I suspected that it would be gone very quickly, but when I saw it was still playing a week later, I went right away to see it. The screening where I was this at today was quite well attended actually, another surprise. Maybe this movie appeals to a lot of foodies and/or people interested in French movies. While this is not an \\"important\\" movie and it is very light-hearted, I might still suggest you check this out in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray, if the topic seems to be of interest to you.e regular Desert Chef blows up because he feels threatened and insecure, imagine that!).

B005LAII12|4.0|Falls short of expectations and I fell asleep mid-movie because it didn't keep my interests too high. Funny, but kinda stoooopid - transaction with the seller was perfect, though.  Cheers!
B008HTQ28K|4.0|Think Jeffrey Archer's 'Not a Penny More', rather than some of John Grisham's earlier, serious legal offerings. Once again, though, Grisham uses his substantial legal knowledge to craft a highly entertaining story, leaving the reader wondering whether the FBI, and the US legal system, may have a lot to do with law, but less to do with justice. The Racketeer is peopled with interesting characters involved in audacious plots and, while the conclusion is not a complete surprise, it was a very rewarding one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I heard how addicting this game was but now I know. can't stop playing. I'm so glad this is finally on kindle.
B004TL0J5M|4.0|Michael Connelly just gets better and better. The engaging, and oh-so-human, Mickey Haller throws himself into defending another case in a novel peopled by convincingly crafted characters, seen through Haller's self-deprecating eyes. Connelly knows how to plot a good story, and keeps his readers spellbound... to the end.
B00E3IZIM0|4.0|I watch my 3D movies on a 65&#34; LED TV.  The 3D was done very well in this film.  The amount of CGI is amazing in Pacific Rim.  For me the story line is good but doesn't really bring much emotion or deep thinking.<br /><br />Will I watch it again, I probably will just because the graphics are great and the 3D was don well.<br /><br />Audio is great too.
080701429X|5.0|I HAVE READ MANY BOOKS ABOUT WORLD WAR TWO AND SOME THAT INCLUDED MATERIAL ON THE NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMPS. I THOUGHT I KNEW QUITE A BIT AND WHEN THIS BOOK WAS PUT ON MY LIST FOR MY BOOK CLUB TO READ, I WAS NOT EXCITED. BEING A GOOD STANDING MEMBER OF THE CLUB I BOUGHT IT AND READ IT. I CAN TELL YOU STRAIGHTFORWARDLY THAT IT IS HARD FOR ME TO THINK OF ANOTHER BOOK THAT IS AS POWERFUL AS THIS ONE. IT IS VERY SHORT, BUT WHAT IT TALkS ABOUT IS INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally kindle fire got with the program! I have been asking to add this app forever! I am a CC fan....Love the game, play it all the time. Highly recommend it for everyone.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|I purchased the Rainforest Jumperoo in 2012 for my first great grandson.  He loved it!  This year, I have a new great grandson so I bought one for him.  He loves it even more!!!  He's only five months old but he will jump for almost an hour in it if his mother lets him.  He's fascinated with the lights and music and already uses his hands to turn some of the rattle toys.  This jumperoo is easy to put together and folds for storage.  I researched these things to death before I bought this one and I think I made the best choice.
B006M4F67A|1.0|I couldn't get it on my kindle fire.  I didn't know it wasn't for a Kindle.  That is why I rated it a one.  I have no idea how it is.

B007QPFGJW|5.0|I have been following the Harry Hole stories for some time now. With each new book the character, Harry Hole, gets better and better. The author seems to understand, &#34;the more super the man becomes, the more he loses in his life&#34; A must read for all of us who have short comings and struggle to over come them
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This was bought so I had a cd of one of the best albums ever made, by one of the worlds unsung artists.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Glad you have produced a program for kindle. Just wish now there was a working flash drive!!!!<br />Also If linked to email why don't my extras show up from my phone.
B00FPH6A70|5.0|Love this movie.  It is so suspenseful that it even had me thinking every time I would put my feet out of the covers.  Seen this in the movie theater and feel in love with it so I just had to have it on my kindle.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|I loved the book!!! Yet, I had a deception: I had read the paper version in Spanish as  &#34;El Cumpleaños Secreto&#34;, front cover with a lady´s profile.<br />Then I bought &#34;The Secret Keeper&#34; Kindle version and it is the SAME book!  Still, I enjoyed it so much that I am reading it again  to find more interesting details I had skipped at the 1st reading.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I totally agree with miagooch. this game is spool additing to all ages. my mom, grandma, sister, and aunt (including me)  are playing this game always.wow!

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game has a lot of cool features that I have not seen before. the plot was really interesting and like a good mystery shroud, it had awesome moments that made me jump...literally. :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a challenge. I'm already stuck and to think there's 400 levels. YIKES!! But I'm really enjoying this game.
B000I62JAK|3.0|This movie is meant to be satire. Note something satirical can be good or very bad. Actually good satire is very hard to do, and too often the bad cheesy stuff is accepted as good when it truly isn’t because it’s such a challenging thing to do.<br /><br />Zoolander is mediocre satire at best. For a partial list of good satirical films enjoyed by me over the years see the following:<br />1. Trading Places (1983)<br />2. Chasing Amy (1997)<br />3.  There's Something About Mary (1998)<br />4. Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999)<br />5. Meet the Parents (2000)<br />6. Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004)<br />7. Wedding Crashers (2005)<br />8. Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)<br />9. Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby (2006)<br />10. The Hangover (2009)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the minute i seen it was available for download on kindle fire i was in the app store. i love this game its so addictive now i dont have to hassle my husband to get off the laptop now we can play together!
B00F35BV64|5.0|At some point I had to check the credits to make sure Tim Burton didn’t direct this movie. Compared to the first reboot it was pretty dark and depressing. I take it back, Tim isn’t this mean about his darkness, and he is whimsical and somehow makes it entertaining and not sadistic. This movie gets sadistic!!!<br /><br />If not for my love of the overall Star Trek universe I am not sure I would have enjoyed this film. Some of the violence went too far, and the story line felt contrived for the purpose of unleashing so much evil. Yes the original Khan Noonien Singh was evil and generally a bad guy, but I never interpreted him as sadistic. If anything, he was the bad guy you loved to hate. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Kahn is not lovable to me in the least bit.<br /><br />In essence “Star Trek Into Darkness” is the origins of Khan Noonien Singh, from the movie “Star Trek- The Wrath of Khan” and not the music band led by Chaka Kahn. The Wrath of Kahn was released in 1980 and Kahn was brilliantly played by Ricardo Montalban, and this film is possibly the best drama out of all the original Star Trek movies. Nice one to emulate, if you were to do a reboot- strong story line.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think this Re-boot went too far with the darkness and was not nuanced enough in telling the story of how someone can be driven to commit evil.  There was something missing. Then again it was a great film.

B00EUS9JF0|5.0|For me, this is the most consistently excellent album McCartney has made. The writing and arrangements are inspired and New. The songs are distinctively different from each other and yet all fit together for a terrific listening experience. At 71, McCartney is much younger than many artists half his age. It is hard to pick a favorite song on the CD and the 2 extra tracks hold their own with the rest. No filler here. Thank you Sir Paul !!
B002KF2HWM|1.0|One of my favorite movies.<br /><br />Sadly, the wife (who had not yet seen it) and I were forced to give up trying to watch it in HD on Amazon and use VUDU for $1.00 more which, incidentally, always has flawless quality and streaming service.  I wish that I could say the same here.  I probably do $2,000+ / year in overall business with Amazon... but I may have to abandon their Video On Demand service.  it is crap!<br /><br />Oh, and it is NOT my connection which is 100mb/s down and 10mb/s up.  Netflix and VUDU work flawlessly on my THX-certified LG Plasma.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|While it only has Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, and google play, there's a good chance it will get lots of other apps as well. Tab casting is great, but you need a strong computer and a healthy wireless network.
1401938906|5.0|The experiments are wonderful!  It's basically the same information as many other books, but the way Pam writes is so down to earth and understandable!  I just love it!  And the results I have had have been pretty amazing!! Thanks for this book Pam!!
0449011917|4.0|I didn't love it but I did like it a lot.  It filled in much of the empty spaces left in book four and got you ready for book five.  The back story the this book provided was very much needed.  I recommend this book as a must read.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Provides all the information one could wish regarding battery status and time remaining to perform any operation on the Kindle or Kindle HD. Highly recommended.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|This is a very addictive series to watch.  Each episode leaves you wanting more.  It's like a book you can't put down.  The acting is wonderful and the writing is outstanding.  I am moving on to season two..........
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Loved the movie, clever and well made.  A pleasure to watch, quite an interesting spin on the story. I recommend it highly. I might have a problem getting the film back from the friends I lent it to, it's that good.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|My wife and I finished season one and couldn't wait to move on to season two and when we did, again, it was like a book you can't put down.  The characters are getting better and better as the series goes on and the writing is still outstanding.  The last episode of season two is very explosive in many ways.  We have moved on to season three and are loving it also.
1596912863|5.0|A very bright take on the story.  A pleasure to read and pass on to friends, of course they have to give it back to be reread again in the future. I hope someday they remake the movie with better casting, although Darcy was spot on, some of the female roles needed to be recast.
B0036TGT2A|5.0|Wonderful value on this diamond edition. Was surprised to see that it came with a free soundtrack download also. Worth the price definitely to get the DVD, Blu Ray, 3-d Blu Ray, digital download and soundtrack!
031623480X|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read about the truth about what foods you eat and how they affect your brain, I could not put it down, until I finished it, I think everyone needs to read this amazing tell all book written by a neurologist Dr David Perlmutter
B008EL25LE|5.0|Excellent game app.  Not impossible, but you have to work at it to win.  Much improved over Azkend.  One of my favorites.  Would recommend it to all.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|If you love zoo's and animals. You will love this game. This game is very addictive and its fun for all ages.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|As long as you wait for your energy to reboot and complete tasks no real money has to be spent.  Interesting game. Love the quests. Will not uninstall this one. Can keep playing indefinitely.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|A fun history of a wild time in american history. Would love to read more histories like this one. Recommended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game with lots to do! Sure, you have to wait a few hours for some things, but that way your looking forward to it! Anyone who likes horses or wants horses should enjoy this game. You can pay if you want gems, but so far I'm getting along fine without using them! Hope you enjoy it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy crush! I was so happy to see that it was finally available for the kindle fire. I am addicted to this game and so is my son.thank you for adding it to the kindle fire
B00DUCXFUC|3.0|It's okay. I was kinda hoping for more. You can get the regular bluray trilogy and get the same value out of it. Kinda wish I had my 80$ back
B0083UUV12|5.0|I started reading this series after giving it to my goddaughter for her birthday... and it turns out I got way more obsessed with it than she did! Excellent plotline that pulls you in right away!
B008EL25LE|5.0|Played alot of popcap type games, and this one was a nice breath of fresh air! Beat the first one, thanks Amazon for the free app, and as soon as I beat it. They had this one on two days later, KICK ASS AMAZON!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this read.  It was such a page turner and I was so sad when it was over.  I would recommend this book to everybody
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Played alot of popcap style games, and this was a nice change to the norm. Just enough of the old, and enough of the new, to make me happy!
B003S6T62Q|4.0|Joe even though it's in Japan the music is in English and I felt as if I was there singing every song with my lady in my arm.
B00DW1WR14|4.0|&#34;Mature&#34; and &#34;edgy&#34; are not usually terms that go together, but Pearl Jam has maintained that juxtaposition through most of their career. 22 years in and they are still lyrically and musically strong. Produced again by Brendan O'Brien, the formula that has worked well for PJ is back, and the band produces rockers and acoustic bits with equal intensity. The singles &#34;Mind Your Manners&#34; and &#34;Sirens&#34; are fantastic, but all around the album is sound. Not on a level with &#34;Ten&#34; or &#34;Yield&#34;, but makes a nice follow-up to the terrific &#34;Backspacer&#34;
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Our whole family loved this movie, including my kids ages 9 and 7.  A very deep movie (with some humor), that gives much food for thought.  Easy to watch more than once!
B001HN6922|5.0|I babysit my 4-yr-old grandson one day a week.  He kept asking for Cars 2 and I got tired of paying for Pay per View.  He loves it; I love it!
B002VPE1XY|5.0|I wear this on my belt to keep my hands free.  When I need my camera, I can grab it and shoot.
B0010SEMP0|2.0|After finishing (and loving) the first book in this series, I was eager to read the next one.  Well...what a disappointment.  The story starts out well, and the plot is pretty good, but the same plot hole that bothered me in the first book remains.  I won't add any spoilers, but every time I thought of this hole, I was dragged from the story.<br /><br />Cat and Bones still have wonderful chemistry (a nice thing about the book), but what troubled me the most was the way the book goes from a PG-13 story to a rated XXX about midway through.  I don't mind reading steamy novels, providing that they set this tone from the beginning.  The Black Dagger Brotherhood is a prime example of this.  It starts and ends with intense 'romance'.  On the other hand, 'One Foot in the Grave' is very vanilla until that *one* chapter in which the author sees fit to explore beyond the ordinary (this was a very graphic chapter involving beyond the norm activity).  That, to me, is a cheap shot.  If that *one* chapter had been removed from the book, the story wouldn't have been impacted at all, and I would have upgraded my review to four stars.
B00BRUQ3PS|4.0|I can't say I enjoyed this trilogy...it was a tough  and thought provoking read and I'm relieved to be finished with the series.  Crazy plot, incredibly well developed characters and just magnificent writing - like all Margaret Atwood books.  Not for everyone but a series of novels I won't soon forget.  Thank you Margaret.
B002NV9AH8|2.0|Despite having much the same sound as albums like &#34;Wind and Wuthering&#34; and &#34;...and then there were three...&#34;, &#34;A Curious feeling&#34; is a very flawed album from Tony Banks.<br /><br />Trawling through the dozen minus one tracks on offer, while there is definitely promise, and an eerie aura, the main thing that lacks throughout is the vocals. I wouldn't blame Kim Beacon; rather, it seemed 'fashionable' at the time for Genesis solo albums to bury guest vocalists under layers and layers of instrumentation. That said, I don't think Kim's AOR vocals fit in with the Genesis sound at all.<br /><br />Secondly, there are hardly any hooks or memorable moments on the vocal tracks. While there are some good instrumentals, such as &#34;From The Undertow&#34;, &#34;Forever Morning&#34; and particularly &#34;The Waters of Lethe&#34;, the best song on the album, the lack of convincing vocal tracks and a lack of variety add to the sense of this being a poor album, and sometimes vene the best instrumental tracks here feel like a lot of noodling rather than any interesting song structure. For Genesis completists only.
B00F35BV64|3.0|Wasn't that entertained...just couldn't wait for it to be over.  Star Trek fans might enjoy it more but I'd say the movie was basically forgettable.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book is wonderfully written. Going through the book with the character, learning as he learned, kept me turning the pages.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I have recently become a fan of Ken Follett novels.  I read the first Pillars of the Earth series a while back,but I started reading other types of literature for some time, so it was a while before I got back to his novels.  I am also interested in Historical Fiction.  I know that most of the characters in this novel are fictional, they seemed very real.  I was especially captivated by the protagonist, Henry Faber.  (He is a great example of how the protagonist of a story does not need to be the \\"hero\\" or \\"good guy.\\") There were times when I nearly found myself rooting for Faber.  At the same time I was rooting for Bloggs.  I admit that I questioned who would \\"win the race\\" until the very end.  Faber's relationship with Lucy Rose was intriguing.  The internal conflicts that both had made it suspenseful right up to the very end.  I honestly did not know if one of them would make decisions just based on their feelings for each other.<br />The last couple of pages which showed Faber's final message to Hitler shocked me.  I loved the final twist.  I recommend this to anyone who enjoys WWII fiction or anyone who likes Follett but has not had the chance to read this book.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so simple but you can't put it down. It's so easy to play for hours. Great game. I'll enjoy for a while.
B0091TGWYE|3.0|Quality of material is good however the pouch itself is a bit stiff. You may need to place something of a telephone size to expand it first. Otherwise you might have your device stuck inside of pouch.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|LOVE this book...I lost a night of sleep finishing it!  I didn't read the first one, just saw the movie and still found it extremely good.
0375714839|2.0|The print is so small has to be read by a magnifying glass. I think the author or<br />The publisher could have spend a little more for more paper to make the book<br />Readable. I feel I have been taken
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I like this trilogy a lot. They are intense,passionate and at times delightful.<br />You can root for them to find happiness.<br />Can't wait to read the final novel.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My kids love this--all the kids that have ever played it really like it.  It is engaging and they love the &#34;marker&#34; settings!
B00E193TM2|4.0|Well , Worth the space on my HHD ! Just what you would expect from  Five Finger Death Punch, They didn't dis-point.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game..I love a challenge and if u do too than this is a MUST PLAY..u will be addicted for sure
B003G4W49C|5.0|What is there to say really when you read a mind-bending book? The absolute beauty of the writing just leaves you speechless. Well, I'll give it my best shot. This is an excellent starting novel to a series that I am certainly interested to keep pursuing. It presents itself quite clearly as a stand alone novel. You will only feel left wanting if you have an insatiable curiosity for what comes next. The plot has a nice conclusion, yet the story is clearly not over. There is a whole universe out there to explore and endless youth beckoning.<br /><br />Typically, I am not a fan of the science fiction genre; as I have always been more drawn to unicorns and elves than aliens. Surprisingly I can feel Sci-Fi diverges far more from reality than Fantasy ever does. (Perhaps I have completely misunderstood the genre.) Ender Wiggin drew me in from the start. While it is a story of war and personal struggle up in space, I felt the novel really got to the heart of the matter with an epic twist at the end. You connect with the characters and their motivations. You bleed for their sorrows. The addition of an alien race just reconfirms the struggle to understand the human condition instead of detracting into unreality. While written by a LDS author, it is not overly heavy in the religious propaganda but moral dilemmas and the human struggle to understand more than ourselves are presented. I think that is what I love about the LDS church the most. The overall acceptance that there is more to religion than the doctrine and rites presented at face value, but an understanding deep down inside each of us. Ender struggles to find himself in the face of terrifying circumstances and unreasonable pressures. Definitely look forward to this being a movie and a video game. This is definitely a series that holds a lot of promise from the first book. In the junk of pop culture and fly-by-night trends today, we need to focus on the intelligentsia with substance and moral backing to get our feet again.ain.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Restful puzzles are charming and fun, perfect for a moment of satisfaction in the day, or taken before bed. The story does not interfere with the level progression.though momento has the greatest beauty of all the games, the real fun is in the challenge, and this game delivers.
B003XYE7R2|4.0|I have never ready any Sherlock Holmes or any other books by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. I was hooked from page one. It was a really great book. I was surprised that it was told by Dr Watson. Well worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Glad I can get it now on my kindle, finally.  Easier to play on the kindle.like to be able to play any time easy.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|COUNTERPARTS is a great album from the Canadian Rock Metal legend Rush!!!! It´s a return to a more Heavy Metal sound after some more Pop full of keyboards albums like hold your fire and Presto....Some gems like Stick it Out, Cut to the Chase, Animate, Alien Shore, Leave that thing alone and Cold Fire!!!! I really like Counterparts and Test for Echo....If you like Rush you will enjoy it too...

B003OUXECE|5.0|Just like the game . It fills in a lot of the lore behind bioshock. Would recommend. Ten out of ten
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|this part is just what we ordered and needed would recommend and will be purchasing more of them for our business
B00AEFXKOO|5.0|MEL GIBSONS Best movie ever made, I used his wedding vows from the movie when I got married. I wish I had seen it on the big screen.
B008JFUORW|2.0|It really seems as if someone wanted to ruin the film on purpose......<br />Whole movie does not make sense as a hangover film and is not funny at all.<br />Then after credits they show what it should have been!<br />Just crazy..... Never seen a weaker ending of a movie franchise.....
B00C2IPB66|5.0|RUSSELL CROWS Best movie of all time, wish there would have been a 2nd movie made.I wish they made a 3D dvd.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This was a complete waste for me as I could not activate the unit. Two thirds the way through the process I am told that I cannot use this product in my area so at this point it is back in the packaging gathering dust on a shelf of the space saver that the TV is on. None of the information listed in the ads for this product says that there are some locations in the world where this cannot be used. If it is there, I am yet to find it!
B00ESY77LO|4.0|A story of humanity set in 1920's grandeur based on the classic novel &#34;The Great Gatsby&#34;. Great acting, costumes and sets makes it an interesting film to watch. Only gave 4 stars because it's not that uplifting of a story, but no fault of the makers. I just like uplifting movies.
B00785P2QC|4.0|May get boring later but  for now, it's okay. Basic time management game. No real complaint.<br />Not bad at all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a awesome game it challenge you to think and remember number shapes and find a unique items to get to the next room can't wait till they add more rooms&nbsp;I really enjoyed playing this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|glad it finally came down for the kindle.  Adducing game. Hate when I have to wait for more life. This game gets you hooked fast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game.  I have been playing on my phone for months.  I was very excited when I saw it in the app store for Kindle Fire.  I was even more excited when I found out that I could start on the same level as I was on on my phone!!!!!!!  Excellent and addictive game!
B00BR476TG|3.0|There isn't much to say except it just provides a look into what the film is about.  I might actually watch the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|fun and challenging ....and frustrating! '  gun fun fun. This is a brest game to challenge your mind. try it you'll love it
B005LJITS0|4.0|If you like super hero movies, this will fill the spot.  It's a bit more on the adult humor than kid humor.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS GAME TO HIT THE KINDLE HD WORLD AND NOW HERE IT IS!!! I FEEL COMPLETE NOW THAT MY MOST FAVORITE HAM  OF ALL TIME IS HERE!!!! THANX KING.COM!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I can't stop playing it the graphics are awesome about time it is available for the kindle, I'm very happy about to.
B00BU18U82|5.0|Tried it for fun but then I realized that this app is more then fun it's addictive! Had some loose change and bought some add ons and it was well worth it. It does get repetitive but hey it's farming not Grand Theft Auto V! Must try it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love candy crush saga!!! It's totally addictive and a great way to pass the time and although I find the limited lives EXTREMELY frustrating, I still would absolutely recommend it to a friend.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent book!  I enjoyed meeting the characters and seeing how their lives intertwine.  It is worth your time and your thoughts are bound to be stimulated.
B00FN8HS5O|5.0|You can feel the mystic nature of space in each track.  The pulse pounding tracks really get your heart going.
0756407915|5.0|cant wait for the next  one! This book is a great read I could not put the book down until I was finished
B00E0G5U4G|4.0|I first heard about carcass when a friend of mine bought 'Reek of Putrefaction' when it first came out in 1988 and I couldn't get over the front cover. He lent it to me right there and then without even hearing it himself so I took it home and started to listen. I think for the first time I became somewhat freaked out by an album. listening to the two vocalists in conjunction with looking at the front cover made me a little sick. i showed my brother and he too was slightly concerned. But i knew this was very different and very intriguing.<br />Years have passed and I ended up buying all of their albums and saw them twice live (1991 & 2008) and now have the latest in their catalogue &#34;Surgical Steel&#34;. I never thought I would see another album by Carcass but have to admit I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy and hear it. Carcass are my favorite heavy band by far because there is something different about them. There is no obvious devil worshipping or death songs, but the compositions (or decompositions if you like) study other subject matter that removes itself from many conscious considerations and delve into a dark, and at times more frightening realm.<br />I found the album a pretty good return for this talented band. I like the way the songs seem to progress as the albums did from their early in your face compositions through to their later, more structured work.<br /><br />highlights for me include:<br /><br />1985<br />Thrasher's Abattoir<br />Noncompliance to ASTM F 899-12 Standard<br />Captive Bolt Pistol<br />Mount of Execution - particularly the ending<br /><br />the playing is top standard as you would expect however some of the songs seem to drag in parts. Also i wasn't a huge fan of the drum sound and thought the bass drum could have been more pounding like in the earlier albums.<br />But these are small criticisms and overall it is a great addition to their already impressive discography. i hope they release more...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Find objects which will open cupboards and boxes to ultimately advance. Don't expect pictures of objects to locate. Not what I expected, but pretty fun.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The main thing I wanted it for was to play Vudu movies for my son but that service doesn't work with it,only Netflix and youtube which doesn't have the best kids movies. This sucks!!!
0345803493|5.0|This is the 2nd in the trilogy and I cannot put it down. Very easy reading. I listen to more books on CD's but this one I just started reading and could not stop reading and had to get the next in the trilogy right away to continue the story. This has a waiting list at the library.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|History and the movies is always a great combination, but whats really great with this blu ray is the extra documentary , it gives you extra insight on the movie.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I live for  this game..I love hidden games..it's very interesting and I would purchase the full version of the game..I would recommend it to all my friends..
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I am a huge fan of The Shining and was so excited for this book! I was hooked from the start and enjoyed the whole ride. Danny Torrence grew up hard but turned out to be a good man despite the Overlook Hotel and his demons. Abra is a great character too. Fantastic book!! Well worth the wait.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|I watched this with my grandson who has seen it a dozen times. I don't think I will, but it was good enough to see again.
B000001EL3|2.0|Without the elaborate make-up and expert marketing, KISS would be lucky to sellout a 100 seat bar, let alone a theater.  Produced by Bob Ezrin, one of hard rock's most capable producers, he helped lift the band from mediocrity.  This album produced \\"Beth\\", a smaltzy ballad that became KISS' only top 10 single. \\"Shout It Out Loud\\" was a dance floor favorite for junior high students.  To give the production some sizzle, Ezrin brought in outside support artists including guitar heavyweight Dick Wagner to punch up some of the tracks.  Ezrin played a major role in Alice Cooper's work.<br /><br />But even with the outside talent, KISS is really just a dressed up average joe band.  KISS fans don't mind, they are incredibly loyal.  And its hard to beat their costumes.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|The product description leads you to believe you can stream or &#34;cast&#34; your Chrome browser content from any device.  You cannot cast from Apple iPad (not browser content).  I was able to stream from the YouTube and Netflix apps.  Was disappointed as I hoped it was my solution to put my tablet web browser content onto the big screen.  Was able to cast Chrome content from my laptop, however.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 started out slow but finished with an unexpected &#34;bang&#34;.  Can't wait to watch season 4. Great show.  Enjoyed immensely.
0399255370|5.0|I admit it—I bought this charming and hilarious book strictly on the front cover alone as a gift for my five-year-old daughter, and we were not disappointed. This is a book to read to a child that young, and you are totally free to put on your exasperated-parent voice for effect. And, as she's a kid, the peach crayon's tale of woe is her favorite, but I won't say why. Just check it out for yourself. Five stars.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|A strong argument from a brave lady. I am ready to take my place at the table and often reflect on the content of this book when I need an extra dose of reassurance. A great read for any woman forging a new path.
B007PVHMCG|3.0|Once it was built it was put aside and<br />Minecraft on the screen was back in play.<br />There is limited play value for an 8 year old<br />in this cube.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I already have the first Castle DVD. And just bought the second year Castle DVD. My husband, myself and our oldest grandchild love this program. So I'll continue to purchase the other Castle DVD's  until we have the full set.<br /><br />All three of us are hooked on the Castle series. I'm happy that they renewed Castle for the 6th year.  I could continue to watch this program for several more years. We all enjoy this program. I think there is a huge number of people who would love to have it continue as well. Each year it gets better and better.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It really was done well.  Great acting, great cinematography, great storyline - Great Everything!  I highly recommend it to anyone who likes this type of movie.  I am usually pretty good at guessing or predicting movies and books, but this one had me guessing until the very end.  And even then - No dice.  I didn't see it coming.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the Castle TV program. I've been buying these DVD's one at a time for each years programs. My husband and I both enjoy Castle. I prefer to just be able to sit and watch it all the way through and not have the commercial interruptions.<br /><br />Both my husband and myself (and my oldest granddaughter) love to watch these DVD's too. So it's fun to sit with her and watch the programs with her.  If your a Castle fan then I suggest that you pick up a DVD or two and check them out. You won't be disappointed. I'm going to continune to purchase the DVD's until I have all of them in my collection.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a Star Trek fan and have been since I was a little girl watching  William Shatner play James T Kirk in the late 60's.  I think Chris Pine is a MUCH better Kirk, and Zachary Quinto is an OUTSTANDING Spock!  This movie was done well.  Great special effects, fun story, and beautiful pictures.  If you enjoy Star Trek at all, this should be a hit for you.
B004D1AIZ4|5.0|This movie is great. Considering when it was filmed, the cinematography alone was worth the watch. Long flick but highly involving.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I just love this game. its total fun for the whole family. Just when you think you cant pass a level you do.. the levels are amazing..
B000002MP2|4.0|Very happy with product. I've wanted this CD for years and finally got it. I was thrilled that Amazon sent me digital copy online so I tried to use their Cloud Player application. The only reason I gave it four instead of five stars? I can't download this application to my Windows phone. I will have to download to my computer and find someone to help download to my Windows phone because I am electronically challenged. My 15 year old son loves Green Day also which made the purchase so much sweeter except I probably will never see my CD again, therefore, I really need the digital download.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching after the first 3 seasons and watched day after day until the end.  Love the art direction, character development, costumes, plots and subplots.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|I bought this because I saw when I was younger. I loved the guitar duel between the main character and the Devil's lackey, played by Steve Vai. I wanted to see again and share with my son but apparently so much time had passed because I did not recall some of the language used that I find vulgar. I'm pretty open but one word in particular is used frequently in movie and it's one of the few I cannot stand. I recommend watching but not for the young ones. Took off a point for the language but gave more points than it probably deserved just for the duel and my fond though incomplete memory from my childhood.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The premise of this book sounded good, but it is so much more than I ever expected!  I loved how the lives of the 2 women intersect and it is very well written.  I loved this book and I think I loved it even more because I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed it.<br />I know that back in that era there really wasn't much else to do with the orphans, but the fact that just anybody could get a child and never even check up on them to see if they were ok, just seems appalling in this day and age, but it happened.  This book was so much better than I expected and was so pleasantly surprised by how good it was.  I highly reccomend this book.
B000002UAR|5.0|Purchased almost all of the Beatles albums for a class I took for an easy college credit. The Beatles are awesome. Some songs are great, some not so. Very subjective. Bought all albums used. I received an A in the class. I keep the albums to educate my children on music they otherwise might not listen to as much in this day.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I loved this book, don't get me wrong.  I understand why it ended how it did, it makes the most sense.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to spoil it, but I was left wanting more.  It was so hard to say goodbye.  I just got the books this year and lived in that world for around 6 months.  So sad it's over.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is a very nice little sharpener.  Granted you will not get a butter knife razor sharp with this it is just for a good dressing in the field.  And that it does.  Keeps your knife usable sharp while in the field until you can get back to bench.

B00AB65SVE|5.0|I would recommend this DVD to all fans of Modern Family. THe show is clever and funny and we enjoy watching the episodes again and again.
0061689246|5.0|A touching journey and an easy read.<br /><br />I admit, as much as I read books with hundreds of pages, I often find myself struggling to muster up the motivation to continue reading at some points.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman has NEVER caused me this trouble.<br /><br />This book is great for all ages (though there is a lightly-described sex scene) early teen and up. It is a fun story with such great description and a wonderfully flowing story line.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is the funnest most addicting bingo game ever!!!  Its exciting to have different quests to get through so you can earn more bongo chips for the compleation of all the quests.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game so glad it's finally available for kindle fire!<br />Love that it syncs with Facebook so I can continue where I was! Everyone should give this game a shot!
1623650003|5.0|This book constantly had me guessing. The characters are dynamic and fascinating. As soon as I felt like I had something figured out, another plot twist would come.
0321934962|4.0|This is a good start to figuring out how to work with the D7100.  It gives some good insights into the workings and at the same time shows how to make a good photo.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Fun and challenging game.  Only complaint is that I completed all the levels within two days.  Cute concept, good graphics, and very challenging.  I hope updated with more levels are introduced soon.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game so glad its on kindle now. I only miss having my extra lives and 3 more moves not on here.

B008EL25LE|5.0|Good game when u just killing a little.. time..lot of nice free apps they have to offer five stars game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice app to predict the weather. It's easy to use and pretty accurate most of the time. No problems using it either.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This game keeps you on your toes,just wish there were some clues. You have to figure out everything on your own.
B000GWE44U|4.0|This was a great movie, with lots of suspense and twists. I would recommend this movie as a must watch classic for Halloween.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I consider google because lot of time I cannot  find what I am looking for and I try to Google for quick info.Searching quality seem to be good.Have to have new password account on which none seem to work.It has proven to be a good site.Has heard lot of good report on this site.
B00DGGIXS6|4.0|I love Cher.  Who doesn't?  I am so excited she is still rocking after all these years...  There are some good songs on here...  I was a little disappointed at the Club Mixes..  Normally they rock out - but it seems like the original version of \\"Woman's World\\" is a lot better than the mixes..  \\"I Hope You Find It\\" is awesome.  And, I can't get enough of that song from Burlesque.  It is such a great song with a wonderful interpretation.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Not using this as I had perceived that I would. It okay and lot of interesting things to see.but do not think I am going to continue watching.
B003O86FMW|1.0|This was a good read but I guess you really have to give into the notion if this reality. Common sense would say why not just all tributes b and together and refuse t fight? Even if they start killing them off for not fighting the people of the capital will be revolted enough to stop it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This book was fantastastic, I've never read any thing by this author before but I would like to read some more of her books.  I don't know if this was a true story but it sure seemed  real if it ain't.
B00EC6VA98|5.0|I have this and her last release, and there is so much beauty in both it's hard to put into words.  I feel this one is slightly better than the last, which was excellent.  I love cello, and there's a lot of it and other stringed instruments in this album, as well as her beautiful piano playing and angelic voice. So it seems more diverse than the last, and it's so pretty it gives me chills.  Sometimes I'm reminded of Enya, but I think Ms. Obel is more talented.  This chick is a rare form of composer.  So impressive.  I like every song, and that's hard to come by.  Recommended.
0385486804|5.0|I'm just going to write about my opinion and understanding about this book. The author Jon Krakauer really completed a masterpiece. I think I understand  the journey of Christopher McCandless and the respect and ideas the author wanted to convey.<br /><br /> The timeline of the book is not so clear and regular and so is the movie \\"Into the Wild\\". Nevertheless, I think readers can still get the whole story by putting every pieces of \\" the jigsaw puzzle\\" together.<br /><br /> Moreover, the story of Chris McCandless is shown from varied perspectives of other people that Chris had met or lived with instead of recording the own experience of McCandless all the time. However, there's one thing that I'm a little disappointed with. When I read the title and the description of the book, I thought this book was mainly about how the young man lived in the wild. Actually the book talks more about his whole life. Nevertheless, this can help readers understand Chris' characters and thoughts better.<br /><br /> I recommend this book not because how interesting the wild story is, but for this book taught me something about nature, people's relationships and life. Chris didn't have a good relationship between he and his parents, but we can still see the love between them. For example, Chris once told his father that he really appreciated his hard working for his children and he bought an expensive telescope for him. Some may say that Chris was really stupid to abandon his good life and his family, and to travel around in spite of the danger in the wild. I agree that Chris was too idealistic and rebellious, but the dream and the attitude about life and people he had was really worth studying. He was a kind and optimistic young man. He had dreams, so he chased them instead of being changed by society and turned to be passive.<br /><br /> The most meaningful idea of this book for me is that people need to rely on each other, and there are many bright sides of life that we need to discover and enjoy. In the end of the movie of this book, Chris wrote, \\" Happiness real when shared.\\" When he was almost dead, he finally felt the love people gave him and the importance of depending on each other even one is not living in the wild. This is indeed a wonderful book for people especially those rebellious young men to read.
B000001FY5|1.0|This album is a pure classic and should be in every Bob Marley fan's collection.  However the vocals are so low that you can barely hear Bob over the music.  One of my favorite songs is Waiting in Vain.  It's ruined by this remaster.  Find a different version for a more balanced playback.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This movie is awesome... It's a classic! Everyone should purchase this movie!!! It's the greatest King of Pop movie... It shows all of his greatest hits and more...
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|I had not watched this show when it started but my Neice raved about it and gave me her DVD copies to watch and I just got hooked!!  Loved this season and am looking forward to the last although it will be bittersweet :-)
B00DYEBM3I|5.0|I had long since given up hope of ever seeing a new Mazzy Star release when I learned about &#34;Seasons of Your Day.&#34;  I've enjoyed Hope Sandoval's solo releases, but they have tread different sonic ground than Mazzy Star--not worse, not better, just different.  &#34;Seasons of Your Day&#34;, however, immediately evokes the classic Mazzy Star sound.  Some may bemoan the lack of significant evolution, but I am ecstatic to get more of the same.  It doesn't sound like 17 years have passed.  Hope's voice and David Roback's guitar sound as psychedelic and entrancing as ever.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the entire Mazzy Star catalog, then chances are good that you will enjoy this, too.  If, on the other hand, you only picked up Mazzy Star due to their brief &#34;Fade Into You&#34; flirtation with MTV fame then this album may not prove worth it for you.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This is a fairly easy game. Just a little thinking is all it takes. Good way to pass the time. Just wish you could earn lives faster.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I use this app on all my devices to track feeds I'm interested in.  This makes it easy to catch news bites or interest tidbits when waiting at various activities.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A ton of fun for all ages. I play with my children and my friends. I have never spent a penny and I am up to level 80. Love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Bought Downton Abbey at the behest of my wife.  Most of her girlfriends were already a season or two ahead of us, but when we started watching, we just couldn't stop!!  Very good characters and the story line moves along briskly (for a bunch of Brits)...  I love the old cars and my wife loves all the fine costumes (1920's).  Very well done indeed.
B008G3N71W|5.0|Once again I went for a wild ride reading the beautiful, erotic and often witty prose of Chloe Thurlow.<br /><br />Thurlow has an incredible ability to draw you into all sorts of different sexual experiences, whether you think you would enjoy them or not.<br /><br />A Girl's Adventure is aptly named because that's exactly what happens to our wonderful protagonist, Greta. She is an actress who is always cast as the beautiful doe-eyed girl that gets killed or abused. Why is that, she wonders. Then she meets a stranger on a train who sets out to liberate the real, wild Greta that's been hiding behind all those acting parts.<br /><br />When I finish reading something from Chloe Thurlow, I feel like I've had a delicious exotic meal. So get your glass of wine ready (Chloe's favorite is Cava) and settle down for a feast of words.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so glad amazon finally got this game on the kindle.  Ive been playing it for a long time on facebook and love it.  So thanks Amazon!!
B008AIGWVA|3.0|I got this and the giraffe. The grandkids all liked this one and disliked the giraffe. I don't like the fact that they can buy things without me knowing when they're playing with it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I bought it because it was a cheap gadget to try. But there is no really meaning for it. I still need either smartphone or a computer to connect to the internet. and if i have them, then i don't need this thing at all - there are many applications that allow you to do same things right from your phone or computer
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|I've read the reviews and question the lower ones since my gradkids loved this movie. If I were going to a movie by myself I would not have picked Cars. I always assumed it was a children's movie and as such it was a complete success. Even my 2 yr old grandson loved it and sat still through the entire movie. That's where the 5 star review comes from!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I love playing but when you get to a certain point you either pay real money or take three days to move on.  You can use facebook friends if you are on facebook.  It is fun and passes the time well.
B009F7OQ5Y|5.0|My granddaughter loves barbies and when i saw this i thought it would be great for her birthday. It is a very beautiful doll and it's very playable in the sense that it's not something that has to stay on the shelf.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This app works awesome!! So happy Candy Crush Saga is finally available for the Kindles!! The app works great on the kindle....no pausing or anything annoying!! :)
B003G4W49C|5.0|Nicely done.<br /><br />Enders Game comes to us as a finely written narrative told through the eyes of an eight year old who is bred from birth as a living weapon of destruction against an invading alien horde from space.<br /><br />This is not an ordinary tale. Orson Scott Card is a gifted writer.  Ultimately it brims with the moral struggle between compassion for living beings and the fight for survival.  I can't wait to see what they've done with the movie.
B0059QJ6HI|3.0|It is true what they say that different cultures have different approaches to life.  It was difficult for me to understand Danish approach to life and treatment of family.  I found it destracting
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is math in motion. You have to find the right formula. If you are lucky you will hit it right.
0345803493|2.0|Christian Grey is so unrealistic it's almost funny.  Here's this absurdly rich and handsome guy; a sadist, but willing to be vanilla because he's so in love.  Oh please.  And of course, the main character feels so sorry for him, with his gratutiously bad childhood.  This book would have appealed to me when I was a tween, but I'm an adult now.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|I use this App on my cell and have always had fun with it. It makes you laugh at the silliest of things that you say!
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Lacks solid foundation and real character connections (despite main actors are will and his son) , should have known better than to rent this after seeing who directed it. poor script or screen translation.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This was #2 in my quest to read all five.  I've seen all three seasons of the HBO show, but reading these has given me more appreciation of the overall story.  It's also made me rewatch the series, and I've picked so much more after having read the books.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent read! Loved how all the story lines intertwined throughout the story.  The ending really had you thinking about everyday secrets we all  Have.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I enjoyed these characters and this story.  As a retired Secret Service agent myself, I can assure you that Baldacci really did his homework here as to the banter that goes back and forth between agents.  Maybe fell a little short as to an agent letting a protectee go alone into a room that wasn't controlled in some way, but, overall, a good story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is not only a glimpse into the past, it's romantic, funny and beautifully written.  Highly recommend this show!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I really like this DVD it's a classic musical and it's a great thong to have. Really Love it !
B000I0XLYO|5.0|so funny and absolutely loved this movie, perfect for the family, with some classic one liners. Absolutely hilarious, and Ben Stiller really pulled this character off.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just downloaded this on my Kindle after having it on my phone for quite a while ... fun starting over after understanding the game more.  enjoying it and may not connect the two so I have all those levels to play again!
0525478817|5.0|PERFECT PERFECT PERFECT I CRIED AND I LAUGHED AND SOBBED AND LAUGHED SOME MORE.  Perfect story with perfect characters I could read it over and over again.  Best book I have ever read (beside Looking For Alaska also John Green).
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Most people that gave this game one star, did so because they were unable to enter words into the notepad. I too was unable to to enter words until I downloaded a free keyboard. I downloaded Hacker's Keyboard and I am able to enter words by using the &quot;alt&quot; key, then the &quot;return&quot; key. I am using a Galaxy Tab 2 7.0. FYI, this is also a free keyboard. Try my method first, then rate the game. I gave it a 3-star review because of having to use a workaround.
0316227706|5.0|I assume dogs have ALWAYS looked like this when they are diving & playing in the water.  Now, Seth Casteel has captured for us views that have never been seen before.  After a 1-page introduction, each turn of a page shows a photo of a dog looking into water or diving under the surface pursuing a toy.  Each dog is identified by name, breed, & age.  One looks like a shark, one looks like a donkey, others look like alligators.  Nearly all have their eyes wide open, the better to follow a ball or other toy.  Some appear goofy (like the dog on the cover), some appear scary, all are intensely focused.    A word about the layout of the book: of the 90 pictures, only 10 have the binding crease touching a dog's face.  I didn't feel this was bothersome.    I wondered what the dogs looked like when they were not under water. At the back are small b&w headshots taken when the dogs were sitting pretty for the camera on dry land.    I don't know whether I will look through this book over & over again.  But my life is richer now that I have seen these photos.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I watch the series and I was curious about the books so I decided to read them. Not disappointed at all. When I read the story, I can envision the characters from the series in my head. Great read and great twists throughout.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|Have continued with the series from the beginning. Overall, I like the series but think the subplots are getting to many which takes a little away as it jumps all over to different stories.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I really like that you can mix which sounds you like best. I like the frogs, bass, and guitar sounds mixed. I also like that there are multiple rain/water sounds. Very relaxing.
0062225790|5.0|[[ASIN:0062225790 An Appetite for Wonder: The Making of a Scientist]]I have all of Richard's previous books and this is a welcome addition. His childhood and the influence of his parents created an amazing adult who is one of the greatest biologists of our time. Richard is an eloquent writer and speaker. Find something of his on youtube, you will see what I mean!
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|This is a very insightful documentary of the music that was created in the Muscle Shoals area of Alabama during the 60's & 70's.  I grew up in that area during that time and had friends that were part of the music scene and personally new some of the early artists that were a part of the early \\"Muscle Shoals Sound.\\"  I found the documentary to be very factual and thought it did an outstanding job of telling the story of the development of the Muscle Shoals Sound and describing what went on behind the scenes.  I would highly recommend this documentary.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It was so fun. You will love it. All of the suits and you get to control them. One of the best games I have ever played
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was really excited to find out this game was available on the kindle.unfortunately if you don't have any money to spend you cant get very far in the game
B009C7JS14|5.0|Great app. It provides daily forecasts, time and temp.  I like the hourly forecasts because it helps me to plan my day.
B004G600A4|5.0|Bought for grandchildren to watch...have watched it 3 times with them, and enjoyed greatly each time.  Plus a Mandy Moore fan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy to have for Kindle Fire!  Seems to have free power ups on some levels.  Great graphics and super fun app.
B007DA2FHG|5.0|Had recently seen &#34;War Horse&#34; on stage at Smith Center in Las Vegas, so bought the movie DVD on Amazon.  Both stage & movie are GREAT
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun! A little annoyed that I can't choose where to start after I unlock a zone (for free) but it's a great game overall!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My wife and I, 64, watched this with some of our kids and grandchildren as young as six. Video rendition was great on Amazon Instant Video, including the sound.
B00DQVST76|5.0|one of the best buy it if you are a big Madonna fan.  fun sexy all song off her new cd
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|It's been a very long time since any new music has done for me what I feel its divine purpose is-- to inspire, motivate, soothe and enlighten.  &#34;Distant Relatives&#34; has done all of the above from the day I received it to the day that I am writing this review.  This isn't just an album--it's a call to arms.  It is demanding something of the listener, of the black man and woman, of all of HUMANITY.<br /><br />This album begs you to first look within your own soul (self-realization and self-actualization) to understand who YOU are.  Once you reach this level of &#34;overstanding&#34;, you can take the love for Self and spread it throughout the world--for we all are distant relatives.  Me, you, him and her.  ALL of us.  It's extremely hard for me to pick any favorites because whichever song I happen to be listening to from this album at the moment literally becomes my favorite at that moment.<br /><br />However, my standouts (in no particular order) are:<br /><br />&#34;Strong Will Continue&#34;<br />&#34;Leaders&#34;<br />&#34;Patience&#34;<br />&#34;Friends&#34;<br />&#34;Africa Must Wake Up&#34;<br /><br />I recently became an admirer of Damian Marley's work, and my love for his &#34;Welcome to Jamrock&#34; album is what brought me to this great work.  This is an outstanding album from start to finish, and I highly recommend it to anyone who, like me, has launched their own journey of self-discovery and is searching for new ways to fan the flames of knowledge that should burn within us all.<br /><br />Blessings!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It took me over three months to even want to read this third book. I now know why. It's now getting very repetitive and boring. We waited this long for that?  At this point could really care less what happens to them. The way this book ended was rubbish.  Save your money.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|If you loved the movie, you will love the Motion Picture Soundtrack.  It brings all of the emotions of the movie into your home, car, or anywhere else you may be.  I would recommend this purchase for anyone that cannot get enough of Les Miserables.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|This book was extremely interesting and held the readers attention to the end of each book.  I loved reading all the stories.
0345530578|5.0|This Grisham book has more of the twists and turns of The Firm and The Runaway Jury than some of the author's other books. This is the kind of Grisham book I like best.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|What can I say about &#34;The Crow&#34;?  One of the best films Brandon Lee every did?  Wonderful film in Blue-ray!
1781162646|4.0|Although I really enjoyed the character development and the way a vivid picture of fair life is painted, I would like to have seen more &#34;scary&#34; throughout more of the book.
B00C061I1M|5.0|This Album is a masterpiece of diverse music.  The individual songs have meaning with a great sound.  She cover bluegrass, blues, pop, rock and R&B. I personally never though I could relate to bluegrass, but this work swept me off of my feet.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I read this book for a book club, but it's not a genre I would have chosen myself. Once I got into it, the book was hard to put down and I definitely wanted to know what would happen next. However, the characters were pretty stereotypical masculine and feminine without a whole lot else going on. Though the situations were very high emotion, the book told from the point of view of the father who is stoic throughout, which was a little disconcerting. I wouldn't recommend it, but many others in my book club enjoyed it.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|This product is just as described and it was a  great price! I would definitely order again from this seller again! It was a gift and I was very happy with it
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|One of the things about Stephen King novels that I like, is that you get to know everyone so well, even the people you don't like you can at least understand and have some empathy for (i.e. Craigy Weggy from the Langoliers).  But these people, The True, I couldn't get emotionally invested in at all.  I loved the good guys, but the bad guys lacked something to be desired.  Fortunately, the good guys make this book worth reading.
0962477060|4.0|I purchased this book because I needed more information about my guitar fret board.  The book is straight forward and the price is reasonable and affordable.  I like it.
B006M9NJFG|3.0|I don't like Bear Grylls' name  on this thing, but aside from that I don't really have anything negative to say about the product itself.<br />Mine has served its purposes.  Just be aware....that if all you want is a cup/canteen....you could probably get it cheaper at your local Army/Navy surplus store, or one of the Rothcoe models.

B001LM1456|4.0|I think Ed did a really good job as the Hulk, but I made the mistake of watching The Avengers first, so I am more partial to Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I have had this headset for over a year.<br /><br />The sound on these is incredibly good - When the headset isn't attempting to reconnect... and it always, always tries to reconnect and cuts out - even when plugged in.<br /><br />This headset is one of several headsets I have had from Logitech that I have loved until they became worn out. But the thing is- those other headsets wore out after being used every day. (I use them for everything, all day long and for grueling conference calls.)<br /><br />This headset honestly just makes me sad. When I first got it and it started cutting out and resetting its connection constantly, I thought surely it was a fluke. It is not.<br /><br />The awesome customer service people did a replacement on that first headset - but the replacement does the same exact thing. All of my co-workers also use this headset and have the same problems.<br /><br /> The covering on the earpieces themselves is comfortable at first, but will cause sweating after a half hour or so, and the headset becomes very heavy and head squashy after prolonged use - but if there is a wireless gaming headset out there that doesn't, I haven't found it yet.<br /><br />Overall - if this headset did not have the reconnect issue, or if it would at least work without the reconnect issue when plugged in, I would recommend it.  The sound, when things work as they should, is beautiful.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what is going on with Logitech these days, quality seems to be going downhill a bit. I have been a loyal customer for years and have not yet given up on them. I want to continue to love you, Logitech, Let me love you!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Reminds me of the X-Files of yesteryear. Great series, fun stories, good writing. Definitely worth the time to watch it. Have fun!

My purpose was to use it from a Den and then use it outside Lanai to stream vids from my iDevice's.<br />Wrong . . . . . . . I was extremely disappointed with google and this lame product.<br />I am not goin to go into the reasons why, coz I see many reviews have written the limits, or lack of limits.<br /><br />Dont waste your money on this unless u want to youtube lol<br /><br />apple TV does so much more few a few extra bucks.
1451673442|5.0|This book is connected with the Secret book, I really like it. It is a little like a workbook. The idea is to read 1  chapter everyday for 28 days. I am enjoying my read. I haven't finished the book yet

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that this is now available on my kindle! I was very disappointed when it wasn't here but now it is and its great
B002MQYOFW|5.0|And amazing and creative book with lots of suspense-also if you have bought catching fire make sure you have mockingjay too, catching fire has a huge cliff hanger
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game I get lost playing it live the daily rewards you receive just by playing everyday great game to pass time!!
B004USLWVE|5.0|I gave this bag a 5 star rating as it totally deserves it, even though I had to return it.  The bag is 100% fabulous.  I could get my 20+ square filters, 1 DSLR w/105mm attached lens, 4 additional lenses, 1 flash and all incidentals packed nicely into this bag.  The reason I returned it is that I'm a &#34;shorter/smaller&#34; person and the straps could not be adjusted &#34;tight&#34; enough to hold the bag comfortably on my back (and I unfortunately have a not-so-good back)..  It really broke my heart having to return it as I totally loved the bag and how it is designed.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This is a pretty cool game umm you should play it it gets hard people you should really play this game
B007EC27QM|3.0|I honestly don't understand the five star reviews- it's just a basic calculator without parenthesis or anything.<br />Plus stars for stability and it can add. If you're in grade school, you don't need any more functions than this...and there are NO permissions!<br />Minus side is it stops at square root, squares, and pi, and there are no advanced operations such as grouping of formulas-- just two numbers at a time.<br />This should be free, most built-in calculators rival this app's functionality.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Not your average color match game. Their is actually some strategies involved by using different combinations to get various effects
B0036FYO12|4.0|This movie holds up well.  In light of recent news about the NSA, the story is just as relevant today as when it was made.  Great performances by Robert Redford and Faye Dunnaway.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I just installed kingsoft office in my Kindle and was really happy with the functionality but when I opened a power point 2007 presentation the display was not the same as the one I saw in my computer, unfortunately all the legends from the bar charts were gone so it was imposible to tell the chart meaning, that left me wondering if there were any other compatibility issues with office 2007/2010 files I hope not, I had to delete the file save it as office 2003 in my computer and then kingsoft was showing it correctly
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It's not like the average game it actually has a story line and it keeps you on edge wanting to know what happen next
B000ITF86E|5.0|If you like John Wayne, you will love this movie.  Not a complicated story line or deep, thought-provoking dialogue - just lots of laughs and a few touching moments to boot.  Great entertainment.
0143113100|5.0|If someone you love has a brain injury, I recommend this book. The stories in Dr. Doidge's book gave us more reason to hope and incredible incentive to work hard to help our daughter heal.
1449437524|5.0|I absolutley love this small story. It is hilarious (adult language throughout) well worth what I paid on here for it.
B00008Y3VA|5.0|A great collection of Heep tracks packed on 2CD's. Haveing heard them from the David Bron days it's an excellent collectors item.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Omg vary addictive I love this game I got it for IPod iPad and my phone<br />So much fun<br />&lt;3
B000OIZSVY|5.0|I laughed and laughed from preface where the author describes her reaction to producing a runaway best seller on punctuation to the final chapter describing how writing is changing from print to Internet medium leading to a flash on the Punctuation Murderer. Verily, I giggled, cackled, chortled, snickered, and tittered like a fiend: while she is not a disciple of the Oxford Comma, I will forgive her the heresy for the rest of her punctuation doctrine is sound.<br /><br />You should seek out and read this book. Discover how the words \\"best seller\\" can and should be bestowed on a grammar book.<br /><br />If the mene \\"I like cooking my family and my pets. - Use commas, don't be a psycho.\\" tickles your fancy, this is the book for you.<br /><br />Note: Uses British grammar rules, not American.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad this is finally on Kindle Fire.  Totally addictive. I have been playing on my IPhone. The graphics are beautiful on the Kindle
B001UG4VWQ|1.0|so this is in dutch- who'd have thought, no where did it say. =( not even sure it is worth it to send it back
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|You can't stop playing this game. I only wish you didn't have to wait so long for more lives. People of all ages can play as well.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Easiest and best convertion system ever designed.  A must for the baby boomer generation who still has thousands of feet of slides or negatives.  Fantastic system that converts slides and negatives to beautiful PC digital files that look GREAT!  You will love seeing all those old memories again, ex-girlfriend, ex-boyfriends and some of the best times when we were younger.  GREAT SYSTEM!!!  Well woth the price!!!
1593078684|4.0|I like the art and stuff, but it didn't include FFVII or FFVIII or any of the ones that I liked. It may have had FFVI in it, but I can't recall.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I didn't actully read the book but,i read a sample.I am in fith grade just like August.I am intrested in reading more of wonder because it is OUTSTANDING!! i could picture it in my mind as i read a few pages and has kept in suspense ever since then.one last thing is that ive read over and over each time thinking of something different and finding something new.:)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a fast read that will keep you guessing.  You want to keep reading to get the whole story.  Enjoyable, a quick page turner.  If only the real world had such justice.
055338466X|2.0|I found this to be a very irritating book - both in its content and its style of writing. Certainly hard to believe it came from the same mind as the genius who gave us A Brief History. The book is extremely short (I finished it in 3 sittings) and very uneven in its goals - swinging from some mind-bending science to a detailed explanation of what an ellipse is! Seriously?! It's also sneeringly patronizing, the \\"jokes\\" are rubbish, and it is far, far too sure of its conclusions. It's actually quite ironic that the books goes to great pains to show how science has evolved over the centuries, yet finishes in a manner that smacks of \\"that's it, we know everything, no more silly questions please\\". This could have been a great book. Instead it feels like the SUMMARY of a great book....narrated by a really annoying person.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|If you like Douglas Adams, you'll love Kurt.<br /><br />His views of the world are dry and hilarious, void of gutless writing. His prose is magical and witty.
B005UDD1R6|3.0|Good but needs work. I like it because I let me share picture to my kindle. I will warn you it does drain you battery and crash your kindle. But I think that with some work..and an up date ..I should come with your kindle.<br />Steven
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Can't believe it was 800+ pages. I tore through it in 2 weeks. Intriguingly factual storyline (to a point). Not typical King but loved it anyway.
055316791X|5.0|THEY SENT ME THE NOVEL INSTEAD OF THE PLAY PROBABLY HAD A BAD EFFECT ON MY ACTING THE PART OF LENNIE IN PLAY WE WERE DOING IN CLASS OH WELL NO HARM I GUESS
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I love the green face and sweeping second hand, and it's rather unobtrusive size.  I wear a brown blazer or suit alot, so I made my own brown leather watchband which matches the green face rather well in any situation - formal, business casual, and weekends casual.  Extremely versatile and always works.  If you miss a day or two wearing it, you'll have to shake it some to get it charged up again and fix the time a bit when you put it back on.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a great book thus far! It's a great way to reflect upon the miracles that continuously happen to us and around us daily. I am grateful that I chose this book and I look forward to reading it in it's entirety. THIS IS A MUST HAVE within your library collection.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A fun way to waste a few hours. Maybe a few 25 by 25 puzzles in the next pack would be nice.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I HAVE A LOVE HATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THIS GAME.  IT'S CHALLENGING AND FUN AND EXCITING.  I HATE THAT I STALK THE APP STORE CHECKING FOR UPDATES.  CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT!
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I love me some ccr. had this cd several years ago and it got scratched up and wore out. This cd has all of the best ccr songs on it... just buy it! You will not be disappointed!
B0000TB05A|5.0|I searched Amazon under the \\"U2 slane castle CD\\" and I bought this disc without realizing that the format is DVD NOT CD.<br />My fault not to verify, but you would think the search would populate the screen with what I searched for.<br /><br />Ironically, I found the CD version for $400 on Amazon prime.<br /><br />However, the DVD is AWESOME especially the version of \\"Elevation\\"... which is why the DVD gets 5 stars, the amazon search gets 1 star.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was a neat game.. wish there were more levels though. Game beat quickly. Easy but you do have to think a bit!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great with Netflix and YouTube apps! Still getting use to using it with Chrome.<br /><br />Set up is easy and fast!<br /><br />I definitely recommend this product!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great graphics and challenging scenes- good way to train your eye; really like the silhouette feature but earning more helps as you level would be nice
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|OK, the upside-down plane thing was cool, but the rest of the movie was just sad. It's mostly about a drug-addicted pilot and his half-hearted attempts to get off the drugs. My husband flies on business a lot, and I have to say that this movie really made me more nervous about him being in the air. Forget the terrorists; it's the pilots we have to worry about.<br />NOT a feel-good movie about a heroic pilot.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so excited they finally have the real app for the kindle fire. now its easier to play. very addictive game.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I haven't read the book, but I did like the movie.  Amazing acting by Suraj Sharma; I don't think I'd be so comfortable that close to a Bengal Tiger.  Great adventure story. My teenage grandsons really liked it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been playing this game way before it got so popular.  I stopped for a long time due to time restrictions.  Now that I have some more free time it is fun to get back into the game.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Beautifully simplistic story about the journey of life. Great read for anyone who is looking for meaning or something a little deeper.
B008Z7K7R6|5.0|Only draw back with down loads is no screen art that comes with a regular album/CD. Just a couple of slow spots but for not hearing it before down load worth the money.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I'm not sure why I even downloaded this to begin with.  As soon as I realized it was a boring guide to beating levels I deleted it.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|In my opinion the backpack is a necessary addition to the GoPro camera if you require accurate composition. When you are doing time-lapse photography the pack will drain the battery more quickly.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was searching online to learn how to make ebooks and the information online was so contradictory. Then I came upon this book and was amazed that it was free but was skeptical as well. I read the book and was very pleased. It was easy to understand and helped me a lot.<br /><br />Thanks!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad it's finally out for the Kindle Fire HD.  It's just like the icompetitor version and Facebook friendly. Addictive!
B006DGOV9Q|4.0|I did not really take notice of the charging or standby time but in general I think it performs as expected .
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This book is at its best when it describes the Damascus incident, which is in and off itself worthy of a book.  But this book goes way beyond that story and covers the entire scope of nuclear warfare strategy and its ruthless colorful cast of characters.  If that weren't enough you have the opportunity the learn the arcane intricacies of various thermonuclear bomb designs.  And as I was surprised to know, the term Megadeath was part of the military jargon during an era that in retrospect seemed insane.  My only beef with this book was precisely its scope.  I read the kindle version, and when I reached the end, I felt like I had read an 800 page book.  I'm probably way off but either way, it felt long.  But Schlosser  has a lot to tell because the road to Damascus Arkansas is a long and complicated one replete with geniuses, war-mongers, and at times hapless or helpless politicians trying to keep it all under control.  The book ends on an ambivalent note.  The countries that started it all and brought us to the precipice realized their folly and are slowly unraveling the dangerous nuclear machinery propagated by paranoid  ruthless characters like LeMay and Telfer.  But we wonder what good it will really do with the genie now in the hands of less experienced states like Pakistan and India.  That developing story would be good sequel to this book.  I recommend Command and Control because it offers a wealth of information that appears exhaustively and accurately researched.  The Damascus incident itself was for me  strongest point of the book, but one should know that the author takes one intimately close  to that spellbinding story,  and then  pulls us way back into Cold War history  for many pages.
B00FWLSLJ4|2.0|A grossly over-rated robots v. monsters flick.  I felt like I was watching an overly long Godzilla movie.  But the storyline in the original Godzilla movie made more sense than this piece of utter silliness.  I fast forwarded through much of the inane dialogue.  By the end, I was hoping the monsters would win.  Two stars only because the special effects were good.
B00CRGZMUI|4.0|I read a lot of reviews slashing this book to bits, but I loved it.<br /><br />The first part took a bit to get in to and really understand what was what, but once I had a hold on all the characters I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />This book had the perfect balance between humour, feel good moments, and yes, tears (be prepared).
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Friends and I saw this film because of the reputations of two of the leading ladies and enjoyed it more than we expected.  There are multiple sub-plots and a look at a culture that we don't see much of in our world.  We felt that we needed to see this film a few more times to get it all.  It is enjoyable to view more than once.  The performances by the cast are, as we would expect, stellar, and the overall film is truly enjoyable.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|I purchased this early on Amazon because you will not be able to find it closer to Christmas at a reasonable price. She is beautiful and detailed, the contrast between the hot pink and her skin color----stunning, love all the cat Monster High dolls. My daughter will be happy at Christmas.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really enjoyed it! Ready for more. Some levels are too easy, but some are quite hard! Can't beat the price!!!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Action adventure and excitement. Marvel needs to put me in the next few movies so I can show them I am Spiderman :-)
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|All is well that ends well. Good story. Kept my interest though out all three books. Sweden is very different than the US, interesting to learn about.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Watched this is my Batroom in my house and was done very well. Love the effects and director really created a great story.
B00E8G5H6Y|4.0|Receiving this last season as pre order I was visually puzzled at this blu-ray only having two discs instead of the usual three.  Then I noticed only eighteen episodes compared to twenty two or so from previous seasons.  Like the others season five does not disappoint and upon reaching the end I suspected that sale of Lucasfilm to Disney may have interfered with a final 4 part story arc involving the death of darth maul.  If the idea was to leave Aniken in a state of being similar to how we see him in Episode 3 ROTS then there has to be something missing in those unaired four episodes.<br /><br />Here's what I surmise would've happened in the final story arc after Asoka leaves the jedi order.  Episode 19-22 would've revolved around Palpatine testing the darkside potential of Skywalker using Darth Maul.  During the clone wars Aniken is held in high esteem and often treats Obiwan as an equal but then notice in the opening battle sequence of ROTS he refers to him as master.  This may elude to Aniken getting demoted in some way over the conflict with Maul.  Either way there is the incomplete feeling you get in season five.  Some of the most exciting moments of the entire clone wars animated series are in Five but it will certainly leave you asking questions and trying to play detective as to why it didn't get the full treatment past season sets did.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A riveting book. Exciting, sad, thoughtful.  Now I can  imagine what it feels like to be the parent of a child like Jacob.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|The game is a BLAST! I added this  game on the request of my  3 1/2  year old great nephew.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|A  great stalking experience. A true phenomenon. It had to be written by someone with great talent such as Sara Shepard. Best book ever.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|I love the DVD, there's nothing like it!..I'm a big fan of the Eagles and this box will be up there along with my other EAGLES collection..
B0053TMP24|5.0|The best book ever! If you love action and adventure you will love this book! This series keeps me up all night feeding. Get this book now!!!!!!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Excellent product, great seller!
B002ZG97RE|5.0|HAVE WATCHED MATT DAMON IN THE MOVIES HE MADE IN THE BOURNE SERIES.  THE GREEN ZONE SORT OF PICKS UP FROM THERE.
B000HF2NTE|5.0|Probably Sylvester Stallone's best movie<br />Somewhat violent, but if you want to see the bad guys really get it, this is your kinda movie!
B00DIMXTBO|5.0|Full marks to Brandt for achieving the remakable outcome of improving on his first novel, Outview. I absolutely love anything with a New Age bent so me loving this one was a given. But loving it this much? Yes I did and I can hardly wait until the third installment in the series.You have a fan in me Mr Legg and may your wonderful work carry on for a very long time.
B000I9YX06|5.0|A suspenseful who dun'it Sci-Fi movie with excellent animation combined with live acting and an original plot. Makes an excellent companion to Will Smith in Independence Day
B00AB7HESI|1.0|Ugh I was excited to finally be able to play it but it says I dont have enough space even when I do waste of money :(
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It sure is nice to be able to look at the forecast at a moment's notice.  The graphics are great and I love the videos.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I feel that king makes better games than most developers, and I am glad to finally be able to get this one on my kindle. I like playing this one better on my kindle than on the regular pc. Thanks for the game!
193700788X|3.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />After 13 books, Sookie doesn't seem to be any better off than she was originally.  She started out alone and ends alone. Eric becomes a shell of his former self.  Sigh
B008I34ZQG|5.0|I've loved Zappa since the early 1970's and Hot Rats.  These three albums, (Yebouti, Sensation and Apostrophe) show every facet of Zappa's musicianship, invention and arranging ability
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I like the effort that they put into this game.. it has a certain variety of things that you can do with it (for example the sparring or that you can cash in your achievement for rewards)
B008I34XUY|5.0|I've loved Zappa since the early 1970's and Hot Rats.  These three albums, (Yebouti, Sensation and Apostrophe) show every facet of Zappa's musicianship, invention and arranging ability
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was so much fun. Not only do you get to search for hidden objects, but you also get to accomplish goals while doing it. Definitely a game for mystery lover's.
B008I34ZG6|5.0|I've loved Zappa since the early 1970's and Hot Rats.  These three albums, (Yebouti, Sensation and Apostrophe) show every facet of Zappa's musicianship, invention and arranging ability
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I couldn't put it down. It makes you look at your life, the people around you and the puzzle picture it all forms.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Great family game and entertainment<br />And strategy moves. Fun for all<br />Challenging and a must buy!<br />Keeps family united and talking to each other instead of on electronics.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I have seen this movie several times online and liked it well enough to order my own copy.  Played it for several members of my family and they enjoyed it as well.  I tend to gravitate toward films in which a child carries the weight of the film and though everyone in the cast did a great job, it was Freddie Highmore's performance that captured my heart.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Does what it says flawlessly. Just needs a few more apps like HBO Go. Works great with my android phone. Highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for an inexpensive and very movie piece of electronics.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This is the best card game ever. my five year old loves counting the numbers. You cant go wrong down loading this game is great.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Read the first 11 Jack Reacher books. All good. I will look forward to # 12 . If you like mysteries, you won't be disappointed.
B00E687MWQ|2.0|Not my favorite Satyricon album. Althhough I consider myself both a huge fan og black metal and specially Satyricon.<br />It seems to me that there is an idea that keeps spinning on and on again, but never really lift of. I miss the agression that used to be. This time, the agressiveness seems to be more &#34;polite&#34; and does not give you that &#34;punch-in-your-face feeling.<br />But, that might just be me not getting the point.<br />Nice cover though<br /><br />I will still be playing my old Satyricon albums, and still hope that I might get the point.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I had been checking daily for candy crush to become available for kindle and it's finally here! I became addicted to it on my smartphone. It is possible to pass levels without spending a dime! I have done it:)
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this series other than I read all the books in less than one month! Amazing!
0486409511|5.0|I find myself going back to this book over and over again when I need a little refresher. It's the book I leaned on the MOST when I was learning Copperplate. I would recommend this book to anyone--from beginner to expert--who is interested in the ins and outs of Copperplate Calligraphy. Easy to read and understand, examples of correct vs incorrect, directional movement, how to line your paper for varying sizes of writing...and so on. It's fantastic. I appreciate that the writer took the time needed to create such an informative and useful tool!
1476734941|2.0|I read most of it but the way they tell to eat for so many days the cut back for two with very little calories don't seem healthy to me
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so glad when this game finally came out for the kindle fire. Love the bigger picture as it makes the game easier to play.
B00000331V|5.0|A reminder of how to enjoy yourself . A real band in the true sense , a very UP listening experience .
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This is a great action adventure to watch your kids. We watched it with our kids when they were growing up and now with our grand kids.
B000005RPX|5.0|3 gigs , each different , each classic , they could have just released 1 whole show and Made in Japan would be the landmark live album it is .
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Arrived in perfect shape, well protected.  As I said, for a sequel it is outstanding, most sequels I've seen don't live up to the original, but not in this case.
B000003CMB|5.0|Just how good is this ????????<br />Ranks with the best live albums because it is & deserves to .<br />Amen .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great for everyone. Very addictive.  Try so hard to only play in my spare time. Glad that it is finally on Kindle.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|STOLE MY HEART!!!<br /><br />heartheartheartheartheart<br /><br />All I can say is WOW!!! This book really took me by surprise. I’ve been a little frustrated with all the heroes and heroines in my fictional world being so young – BUT Layken and Will are a refreshing young pair! Both dealing with an unbelievable challenge, Colleen Hoover makes me root for both of them all the way through the entire story. I could not put this one down, and read it ONE day – ignoring all my responsibilities!  The poetry is OUTSTANDING, beautiful, emotional, and gut-wrenching. This IS the book that made me open my journal and begin writing again! SLAMMED gives you a little bit of everything – young love, death, responsibility, friendship, and pure romance. I want a REAL Will Cooper in my life!!! Colleen Hoover is quickly becoming my most favorite author!! MORE PLEASE!!<br /><br />Remember, BOYS are just BETTER in BOOKS!!!!<br /><br />And I’m in love with these fictional characters, Layken and Will!
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Very good book. Never read anything before by Sanderson. Had a very comic book, cartoon, movie flare to it. I liked it. I thought it was a bit over the top -- otherwise I wouldve give it 5 stars. I recommend it though.
0385732554|5.0|Great book I read it myself but was purchased for Son school work.  Would recommend it to other people. Thank you much
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally this app is on kindle! Been playing it on Facebook iPhone and android for awhile now and waiting for it to come to kindle!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Hands down way better than the movie. Starting the second on  now! It was so well-written and I could picture everything so perfectly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|now I don't. have to buy an Ipad! so excited.<br />I have waited patiently, and now, finally, I WILL GET NOTHING. DONE ANYMORE! SWEET!
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|If this book does nothing else, it certainly opens your mind.  You begin to look at everything in a different light!  Very good
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|It is an easy read, with an interesting approach to grit! Recommended to everyone in the education world. Thank you
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoy playing these hidden object point and click adventures. This is one of the best I have played.  The storyline was very good and fit well with the puzzles and mini games.  I found the game challenging but not overly so, it was a pleasure to play. I will definitely play another one of these type of games from Alawar.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is true love/hate. It makes you keeping fiending for more. I swore I wouldn't get into it but played 3 levels and never stopped. Excellent pass time
0385743564|2.0|Sometimes an author writes a terrific novella (The Emperor's Soul) and you wish it were longer and want more of the story.  Then there are books like Steelheart where it feels that it just never ends.  Steelheart for me was shallow and the characters were annoying and flat. The \\"bad metaphors\\" and jokes were so awful it became grating. A couple of reviewers that gave low reviews say it was like a comic book.  That is an insult to comic books.  Steelheart was more like a Scooby Doo episode.  I will not be reading the two additional books that will complete this series.  I understand there are Brandon Sanderson super fans that will read all of his works.  I get that, but in general his writing isn't for me.  If readers are interested in a fantastic superhero book, please look into \\"Vicious\\".  The writing is superb, you get the POV of all of the characters and you will be screaming for more.
B008Y70TMK|5.0|Not much to say here, but if you're reading this you should know that this is considered a classic. Roger Ebert's original review was right on point, which I'll quote here:<br /><br />&#34;The movie stars Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, and Harold Ramis, three graduates of the Second City/National Lampoon/&#34;Saturday Night Live&#34; tradition. They're funny, but they're not afraid to reveal that they're also quick-witted and intelligent; their dialogue puts nice little spins on American clichés, and it uses understatement, irony, in-jokes, vast cynicism, and cheerful goofiness. Rarely has a movie this expensive provided so many quotable lines.&#34;<br /><br />So many quotable lines from this movie. If you haven't seen it, keep in mind that the comedy *is* more understated than many comedies today, but no less funny, and much smarter.
B00E3IZIM0|2.0|This review is specifically for this blu ray 3d ultraviolet version. I was extremely disappointed when this had no digital copy to add to iTunes. I love the movie and give it 5 stars. The lack of a digital copy ruins it. You have to log in to flixter.com to get a streamable version. They ask for your birthday which I will not give. There is no iTunes version.
1848549245|3.0|I like this book. It has some good advice, but nothing earth-shattering. My favorite bit was their section on will power and mental resources, but you can get a better glimpse of that research in Daniel Kahneman's Thinking Fast and Slow.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game so far. It is easy to understand how to play while still being challenging. I'm glad I downloaded this game.
B003MVJG8Q|5.0|I was impressed with this product because it didn't require any more drivers to work on my hp desktop.<br />Economical and easy installation.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Loved how this item works with multiple devices! Very easy to use and very user friendly to set up. Great purchase.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Rarely can u find a story that is so interesting yet entertaining while being 100 percent true.  The Lord works in so many ways, this book does so much more then tell the life of Adam Brown, it reminds or teaches us all about what is most important.  Our family through Jesus Christ.  Thank you Adam and Thank you Lord
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THIS IS AN UPDATED REVIEW:  Okay, got the Candy Crush bug!!  At Level 178; I think sometimes it predicts your moves and let's you win if you've been stuck for a couple of weeks or more.  Just when you think it can't get more difficult, it does!!!  Then there are levels where you win on the first try.  Oh well.  At least I haven't paid a single cent on this game.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|THE NEW UPDATE SUCKS!!! WAY TO SLOW LOADING. PLEASE FIX OR I'M DELETING. AMONGST OTHER ISSUES. WHY DO U NEED TO KNOW MY AGE. IT'S FREAKIN UNO FOR CHIRST SAKE. USED TO BE MY FAV GAME.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Bad Piggies is an interesting game.  In it the point is to build vehicles that allow the pigs to get treats.  You are given materials to assemble and you can build and rebuild until you succeed.  It allows you to use your ingenuity.  I enjoy playing it.  The only trouble is. . . I love the birds and I miss them.  But this is a pleasant break when I get tired of hurling birds at the pigs or start to feel sorry for the little green creatures.
0744014956|5.0|What can u say about this book. It's great everythin u need to know to get a 100%. I like it buy it and u might like it too. And it show the location of the altruist cult place. Get guns and go over there and have fun doin it.
B008JFUR10|3.0|I can't stop from criticizing this film for it's originality due to borrow elements of Neon Genesis and Ultraman stuff like that.  I would definitely find more original if they would find a different term for kaiju.  Overall, the movie was good... the ending really lacked a punch tho.  I don't regret this purchase because it's the genre I'm into, I'm also glad that I didn't watch this in the theatre.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this app. The levels were fun and you really need to be creative and think as it challenges you.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I normally love my Kindle fire but there are certain apps that just don't work wel together on this device. For me two of those apps are Pintrest and Facebook. Maybe my tiny little fingers are just too big or maybe my screen is too sensitive but I spend half my time trying to correct something that got posted some where wrong.
1616550414|3.0|The Hyrule Historia spends a few short pages telling the epic story of the Hero of Time and the history of Hyrule. The rest of the book is dedicated to Skyward Sword concept art.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So happy that the real thing is now available....thank you!  My girls will be so happy to know they can finally play this on my Kindle Fire.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was doubting that it would be as good as everyone said..it was great! I did not read the book but I am now considering it. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing. I love Woody and Elizabeth Banks was perfect! I recommend this movie for all movie lovers
B0068MNO4S|4.0|Not sure how true to the facts this movie is. But it was well writen... Different slant on that time frame.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Really, really good finale. Like the other two books in the trio, this one was impossible to set down! I really enjoyed reading the trio.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Nice and it works well but it can use more apps, Some times using the computer it can hang up some so that can use a little work,
B004ADH1RI|5.0|This is one of the best children's movies of all time.  Fun for the adults too, it never gets old.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Crashing and blocked by my security. Not a good thing.<br />Unfair because my kids loved it, even though it teaches nothing.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like the game but don't get fooled by the &quot;400 levels&quot;.There are only 72.It's not the best app. If I New all the bad parts I would not get it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|To think that such young children had to endure such brokenness and heartache is sad. The book is well written.  You want to go get the children, give them a good meal, a warm bed and love. Great book!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This film changed my life. The messages is conveys are so needed.  I watch it at least every six months to help re-center myself and my focus.  I don't want to be a father who is &#34;just good enough.&#34;  This movie has helped me be the father I want to be and the one my children deserve.<br /><br />Even if you aren't looking for a movie on fatherhood, this movie is entertaining. The movie has humor, excitement, drama, tension, feeling.  These guys aren't professional actors, but they convey true emotions and feelings.<br /><br />&#34;Never let go of the steering wheel!&#34;
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Works great sound & picture, easy to set up and get it working. The only drawback is, it only works on few apps, does nor work on any third party apps not even to see your pictures from your on tablet or phone. I hope google will realize that and get it open to third party developers so you can use it on live streams and web pages other than Netflix, you tube  and few more apps.
B007SGM084|5.0|Once I started on the first book I was completely captivated and EL James kept me hooked to the very end!  I will definitely be rereading these books and count this purchase as a very enjoyable distraction.  Excited to hear about and read her next offering.  You wont regret this purchase!
B0044XUZ9K|5.0|Although I have read this book as a child. It gave me great pleasure reading this to my grand daughter, and even more watching my 11 year grandson read it and get all excited about pirates.
B00CW6DAKC|5.0|I have played many different farming games and find this game to be one of the best. The graphics are great, and the crops won't wilt or die from neglect. (Like I need that!)  After playing the game for a couple of weeks, I've advanced in levels quickly, and haven't spent any real money.  Please add me as a friend. My game id is FASGCOW. I give  daily  gifts!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game surprisingly. I was pretty sceptical at first but after playing it I really enjoy the gameplay and that it is not repetitive.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting forever for this to be available on the Kindle. It's such a fun game. Very excited I can play it again.
0143124544|4.0|This was our book discussion's chosen read and I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I liked it. It's the story of Will Traynor: adventure-seeker, successful corporate lawyer, fun-loving playboy, who is suddenly transformed to quadriplegic in a freak accident. Into his life comes Louisa &#34;Lou&#34; Clark, hired by Will's mother to be his caretaker but also to try and cheer him up, unbeknownst to Lou.<br />They are two completely different people with vastly different life experiences but they develop a remarkable relationship over the six month time frame of the story. This was a deceptively simple story, told really well, with quirky, lovable characters.<br />The one question that has occupied my thoughts since finishing this book is which character was the &#34;me&#34; and which the &#34;you&#34; of the title.<br />Best book I've read since &#34; Beautiful Ruins&#34; by Jess Walter!
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|It's very different and the stick is unwieldly. It's not a favorite...I tried to communicate with the guest player to no avail. I will keep trying to understand needed technique
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is now my new favorite game! I recommend it for even teens and younger. Have a blast with new upgrade and cool scenery and props!:)
B00F9040HU|1.0|This is just a teaser to get ppl to buy the entire game. The way you portray &#34;buying&#34; a free game is misleading and causes me to NOT want to attempt any of these games.

1780387105|5.0|This songbook is most helpful as you take his online course, but I'm sure it would be helpful even if you aren't.<br />When you get a good teacher like Justin, you realize how many mediocre-or even bad ones you have had to endure.<br />The book has the lyrics and music (guitar chords) along with suggested strumming patterns.  You also get his help online on his website, justinguitar.com, or on You tube.  He plays the songs on video where you can play along with him.<br />I get the feeling that I have a personal teacher who cares, (he has a friendly manner) is organized, never patronizing, doesn't skip steps, and has had years of musical training and experience.<br />It probably doesn't hurt that he lives and works in one of the musical capitals of the world-London.<br />Some of the songs I didn't know such as Lennon's \\"Working Class Hero\\" and \\"Common People\\" by the Pulp.  I enjoyed reading the lyrics which weren't the usual love songs.  They tell an interesting story and have social significance.  However, there are more \\"popular\\" songs too.  Enough songs to keep you going and interested.<br />If a beginner like me without a good musical education, your musical terminology will improve as you start each song.  For example,in the first songs you are introduced to the use of capos and what off-beats are.<br />The book is more than a book, it's a musical journey.  One that is just right-not too easy-or too hard.  You can do it, but you grow as you keep  learning and trying.<br />There is a forum on his site where he answers questions and other learners share their experiences playing the songs.  Also where he didn't play a song, I found a student of his playing the song on You tube, and it helped me a lot.  Where else do you get a songbook and a free forum (a community of people like yourself) asking questions, sharing difficulties and getting advice from Justin and the other guitar learners?
0440246318|4.0|This is the first (and so far, only) Jack Reacher novel that I have read. I was a bit worried that I wouldn't enjoy it, as I know pretty much nothing about the character. I haven't even seen the recent movie. I was pleasantly surprised to find that my ignorance of Reacher mattered not; the story works well on its own.<br /><br />Most of the story takes place inside cars, which isn't as boring as it might sound. The story centers around a mysterious murder in a small town, which also isn't as boring as it might sound. The chapters are short and Child's writing pulls you in; I found myself always wanting to read just one more chapter. And then just one more. Rinse, repeat.<br /><br />This book includes a \\"bonus\\" short story, which I also found enjoyable.<br /><br />After reading A Wanted Man, I'll definitely pick up another Jack Reacher novel when I get the chance. I found him to be a very enjoyable character to ride along with. One thing is for sure, the Reacher I met in this book was nothing like what I pictured thanks to the movie ads with Tom Cruise.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The first book I have read that has provided a meaningful and objective look at the historical person of Jesus and the roots of the modern Christian church.  I am not a scholar and until reading this book after hearing the author interviewed, I had pretty much given up ever getting past the mythical person presented by vocal conservative Christians.
6304711905|4.0|My girlfriend and I made a road trip to Tombstone, Arizona on September 20-22, 2013, so we immersed ourselves in the history and legend of Wyatt Earp and the whole saga of the Old West.  As Hollywood movies go, this one is pretty accurate, although there are a few instances of artistic license.  For example, both this movie and Costner's \\"Wyatt Earp\\" get the shootings of Virgil and Morgan Earp wrong (they were shot months apart although both movies show them being ambushed the same night).<br /><br />Comparisons to \\"Wyatt Earp\\" are inevitable.  Which movie is better?  Apples and oranges to a certain extent.  \\"Tombstone\\" is paced to be more of a \\"popcorn\\" movie.  \\"Wyatt Earp\\" is presented more as a historical epic.  I enjoyed both movies.  \\"Wyatt Earp\\" spends less time on the Tombstone Arizona aspect of Wyatt Earp's life since it's supposed to span his whole career.  \\"Tombstone\\" focuses almost solely on that period of time before, during, and after the Gunfight at the OK Corral.<br /><br />In summary, if you prefer a \\"fun\\" movie to pass an evening with, then watch \\"Tombstone\\".  If you prefer a more serious presentation of a historical epic, then watch \\"Wyatt Earp.\\"

I wish the filmakers had stuck to the stereotype of the black &#34;Boss of the Plains&#34; hat for Costner's movie Earp (as they did for Kurt Russell in the movie &#34;Tombstone&#34;).<br /><br />In summary, if you prefer a &#34;fun&#34; movie to pass an evening with, then watch &#34;Tombstone&#34;.

B00A2H9WW8|2.0|Theatrical Review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />Director, Kimberly Peirce (\\"Boys Don't Cry\\") is a friend of Brian DePalma, the director of the original 1976 thriller, so I'm sure he provided the proper encouragement to update this excellent Stephen King story.  And yes, the film is updated with picture-taking cell phones, music, cars and clothing.  Unfortunately the film is also pretty boring.  Chloe Grace Moretz (\\"Kick-Ass\\") is certainly more age-appropriate to the character of Carrie than the 20-something Sissy Spacek in the original.  This Carrie, while still withdrawn and insecure, is also a little quicker to \\"come-out\\" in terms of her kinetic powers.<br /><br />With a bone chilling opening scene, Margaret White (excellent Julianne Moore) is in the process of birthing baby Carrie and comes fractionally close to plunging a pair of scissors into the baby's skull thinking she is the offspring of the Devil himself.  Clearly mentally unstable, Margaret's motherly instincts override her original impulses.  But as Carrie grows, she is sheltered from the real world and is forced to spend time in a prayer closet for such improprieties as suffering the onset of menses.<br /><br />Carrie is the brunt of brutal bullying at school, which is led by Chris (Portia Doubleday).  When Chris refuses to repent, she is expelled and can't go to the prom.  Her revenge is centered back on poor Carrie who gets to go to the prom with Tommy (Ansel Elgort).  He's the boyfriend of Sue (Gabriella Wilde) who does feel guilty and is trying to make amends.  So if you're familiar with the story you know what comes next and I was admittedly anxious for it to start.  But even updated with new CGI special effects, I wasn't transfixed like I was with the '76 version.  In that film, the first thing that happens is all the doors to the high school shut down tight, keeping everyone enclosed in a big room where Carrie can do her damage.  Here, people are escaping (or not) through various exit opportunities.<br /><br />I will admit that Moore's portrayal of the deranged momma Margaret is very convincing and very good.  Moretz is fine, but everyone else is just eh.  This isn't a horrible remake, but it is certainly unnecessary.tunities.<br /><br />I will admit that Moore's portrayal of the deranged momma Margaret is very convincing and very good.

B0075LTOR2|1.0|I agree with the other reviewers who bemoan the sound of these discs.  I feel like I have been ripped off.  I have played some of the discs a couple of times as I thought maybe I was mistaken... surely it could not be that bad.  But it is!!!!  The sound is so thin, harsh and, as mentioned previously, at times painful.  Do not buy this set.
B00ARHAAZ6|1.0|Great concept and potential squandered by poor delivery.  Each time I was lured in by the plot, some weak attempt at humor derailed me.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|WOW! What a series! I got hooked on the 1st season and now this! It is entertaining!!! WOW! Great transaction.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|This is a review intended for fans of the Oz books. There are plenty of reviews for everyone else but I can't find any geared towards book fans.<br />First of all, I do like this movie and bought it. I've seen it multiple times and think the effects are wonderful, especially with China Girl. Though I'm complaining a lot, that comes from the Oz fan boy in me and as you see I gave the movie four stars. (Since it's a good film, just not a great one.)<br /><br />Is it worth watching? I'd say yes.<br />Is it everything an Oz fan could want? Hardly.<br />It's obvious from the start that the director and the others involved do NOT know Oz, and even if they did read a few Oz books here and there, they certainly didn't let the magic from Baum's stories carry over. In fact, I believe Sam Raimi said he didn't read the books until he was finished with the movie.<br />James Franco claims to have read the books since he was a kid, and maybe he did, he did a pretty good job and I can see his version of Oz growing up into the Oscar Diggs in the books.<br />The others not so much.<br />Glinda fell flat, though her actress did a good job with what was given her and though I think the Wicked Witches did a fine job at acting, I can't imagine the Wicked Witch of the West becoming the book's witch.<br />And that's the main problem with this new franchise Disney is working at.<br />They are leaning so heavily on the imagery and characters from the MGM musical I think they are seriously handicapping themselves for future Oz movies (which were pretty much confirmed).<br />As anyone who's read the books knows, the Wicked Witch of the West is not all that important, she's never described as green, doesn't seem able to fly and actually just seems like a very mean spirited old woman with some dirty magic tricks.<br />The one portrayed in Disney's film is supposed to be a younger version of Margaret Hamilton's witch, no question about it! She flies on a broomstick that leaves a trail behind her,has green skin, a black witchy costume and that cackle. I was so expecting her to do sky writing that I was surprised she didn't!<br />You see, WB holds the copyright to most of those things when it comes to Oz, as well as the famous Ruby Slippers, so Disney had to tread carefully...though they came close.<br />Giant Winkies? Check. Mini Munchkins? Check. Poppies growing right outside EC? Check. Horse of a different color and Glinda bubbles? check and check.<br />You see, those were all things not in the books and only seen in the MGM musical, which is why I believe Disney is ruining any further movies since they can't keep going this way and still claim it's original.<br /><br />What was like the books:<br /><br />As for fans of the books, there are a few nods to us included,<br />1. There is a map drawn by Professor Wogglebug (would he have even been alive during this time?) that shows Oz is divided into four countries like in the books...though they put the Munchkin's in the west and the Winkies in the East (explicitly shown on the compass rose).<br />This caused some major issues.<br />(Mainly the fact that when Dorothy arrives she lands on the Witch of the East...who in Disney's version will be living in the West and the WWW will be living in the East...)<br />2. The Wizard's full name is given as Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkel Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, like in the books,<br />3. Glinda is FINALLY stated to be the Witch of the South, just as she is in the books, and she is referred to as Glinda the Good.<br />4. There is the Dainty China Country, here called the China Town. (Though it's in the Munchkin Country instead of the Quadling Country.)<br />5. There were people called the Tinkers, which I suppose were a nod to Mr. Tinker.<br />6. If you look really closely you can see Baum's face on the coins in Emerald City and the circus the Wizard works at is &#34;Baum Bros.&#34;<br />7. There are green tinted glasses shown near the end.<br /><br />Whatwas not like the books at all:<br /><br />1.There is no reference made to Ozma or Mombi, or the Good Witch of the North, all of whom should be present I believe in this time line.<br />2.Instead, Glinda is the King of Oz's daughter. His name is not given as Pastoria and he was a Wizard.<br />3.Instead of being from Nebraska the Wizard is said to be a Kansas Man.<br />4.There is no color theme for each country present...While much of the movie is spent with Glinda in the Quadling Country everything seems more yellow and pastel shades than red (though the flowers seem predominantly red there)<br />5. The movie takes place in 1905...which is strange since the Wizard of Oz was written in 1899 and published a year later. By the time Dorothy arrived in Oz the Wizard had grown very old.<br />I guess that's another attempt to link it with MGM's movie.<br />6. Glinda is blonde...why was that even necessary?<br /><br />What was obviously borrowed from the famous MGM movie:<br />1.Singing, very short Munchkins.<br />2.Evil red powder (like in the hour glass)<br />3.Horses of a Different Color<br />4.Glinda travels by bubble and acts a bit ditzy (probably in reference to Wicked's Galinda)<br />5.The strange costumes based on the MGM movie worn by the Munchkins and even the Quadlings.<br />6.Glinda seems to have a double in Kansas and China Girl and Finley are obvious references to people from Kansas too.<br /><br />Other problems not reconcilable with either the books or the movie are there too. The poppy field is shown to be on the eastern side of the Emerald City, which would be fine if the Munchkins were in the East as they are in the books and the MGM movie. (They are so close to the city I wonder how they are not considered a hazard.)<br />Dorothy arrives from the eastern side in both versions, though the poppies are no where near the Emerald City in the book.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie, but it really slows down about half way in and it gets really boring before picking back up to a grand conclusion that I did have fun watching!<br />I honestly hope Disney makes more sequels as has been confirmed by the actresses, but I really hope they find their own identity and give us the real Oz fans of the books have been longing for.<br />I don't mind a twist and some Disney originality, but they need to stop being copycats. This just didn't feel like a Disney film to me.

1250030951|5.0|The one thing you need to know about a Rainbow Rowell book before going in is that you are about to experience something special. Eleanor & Park was my first experience with Rowell's books and set the bar rather high as to my expectations. As you can imagine, I went into Fangirl, Rowell's `New Adult' book with all sorts of hopes and ideas of what to expect. Thankfully, Rowell has this magical sort of way with words and was easily able to soar over my expectations with flying colors. I cannot praise Fangirl enough, in fact, I am about to say the same thing every other reviewer has said about this book -- I want to `fangirl' all over it. That is how much I love it, so much so that I have become a cliche.<br /><br />Cath is about to start her freshman year of college, living a few hours away from her Omaha home. Unfortunately, she is in for some bad news. Her twin sister Wren has announced that she will not be rooming with Cath. You see, Cath had imagined a freshman year filled with co-writing fics with her sister. After all, Cath is a BNF (big name fan) in the Simon Snow fandom. Her Simon Snow slash-fic received tens of thousands of views. However, to meet Cath you would not know that she is such a big deal. She suffers from crippling social anxiety, whereas her sister Wren is typically the life of the party. To make matters even worse, Cath's roommate Regean is really mean. Also? Her boyfriend Levi is there ALL OF THE TIME. Oh yeah, and Cath's creative writing professor thinks fanfiction is plagiarism. It is shaping up to be quite the rough semester for Fangirl`s main character.<br /><br />There is absolutely no way possible for me to NOT like Cather `Cath' Avery. She is such a nerd and quite unrepentant about her penchant for geeky t-shirts, cardigans, and glasses. Yet, she feels like more than a caricature. She carries around this anxiety that feels so very real. There's a scene where she talks about being afraid to go to the dining hall alone because she thinks people will be watching her and criticizing her. She gets nervous about going to class. She hasn't seen certain parts of campus because they are a bit off her beaten path. She doesn't make friends easily. Frankly, if you are an introvert, you might really relate to Rainbow Rowell's latest protagonist. The entire time though, instead of being irritated with Cath for having all these issues, I found myself rooting for her. She's just real and raw and written in a way that lets it all hang out.<br /><br />What I really and truly love about Rainbow Rowell's books is that she lets nice guys finish first. Instead of celebrating arrogance, outlaws, and borderline rude behavior, the love interests are often kind, considerate, and genuine people. Fangirl is definitely no exception. I won't tell you who the love interest is because it is kind of a surprise, or at least it was to me. Perhaps I am oblivious. However, I will say that you will find yourself shipping the two almost immediately. Cath's love interest does things like walk her home late at night. He drives her places at a moment's notice. He has his faults as well, and they are real faults. Just know that there is a lot of depth and development in Fangirl's romance. Think the definition of a slow burn or of carrying a torch for someone. Rowell has basically unlocked the perfection level with this book. Seriously Cath and her romantic interest might as well be my new OTP (one true pairing, FYI).<br /><br />Rowell excels not just at romantic intimacy but also at detailing familial relationships. First, there is Cath's relationship with her sister Wren. The two have always been close. Lately though, Wren makes Cath feel as though she is a burden. She seems to have no time for Cath and is spending all her free time with sorority girl Courtney or out drinking. Cath doesn't get it. She doesn't understand why Wren would rather drink than write Simon Snow and Baz fics with her. Fangirl does a superb job navigating the tenuousbond between sisters. This is not the only family layer in the book though. There is also the relationship between Cath and her ad executive father. You see, her father is the sole caretaker of the girls. Mom peaces out when they were kids. Yet, Dad is not quite perfect. He has very manic moments and well, there's some mental illness there. Yet, it's dealt with in such a respectful, realistic way. Then, of course, there are Cath's unresolved feelings over her mother. This will play an important role. Personally, I loved Rowell's exploration of the ties that bind, so to speak.<br /><br />I had planned to write a paragraph about Simon Snow, the fictitious magic wielder. However, I think I will just leave it at the fact that Snow is a fun tip of the hat to Harry Potter, but with vampires. Also? Rowell includes excerpts from the Simon Snow books and from Cath's fanfictions between chapters, adding to the overall authenticity and feel of the book.<br /><br />I feel like I could read books about the rest of Cath's college career, I was so riveted by Fangirl. Everything is wrapped up perfectly in this book though. There's the right amount of character growth and development. There are swoons. There is family drama. Rowell captures what it's like to be an anxious college freshman. Every character within the book has an interesting arc. Fangirl will certainly have you shipping your favorite characters and cheering for what is canon in Rowell's book.bond between sisters. This is not the only family layer in the book though.

In fact, I synced it to my Facebook account and I did not have to start all over again.  It picked up where I left off on Facebook.  I now have no reason to get on my desktop.  I can do everything on my Kindle Fire HD!!!  I have recommended this game to all of my co-workers who own a Kindle Fire.  You go AMAZON....
1478952733|5.0|After many years of  passionate reading, I found that my attention was trailing off; that I simply didn't have the desire or ability to push through an 800-page book any longer. Was thinking of getting a neurological workup actually, but it seems the fault lay not in my brain, but in my books. Donna Tartt's The Goldfinch has restored the thrill of reading to me-the kind of flashlight-under-the-covers reading we do when we are young and just discovering the amazing power of story. Despite feeling lukewarm about the subject matter...a stolen painting? a motherless boy?...in the first 10 pages I was completely hooked, and did not put the book down until I had finished it three days later. Must confess to an unfortunate after-effect; all books I've begun since Goldfinch just seem utterly pedestrian; reading anything else has been like walking through glue. Other reviewers will outline the story of Theo Decker more comprehensively: the tragedy of the museum attack that cost him his mother, his uneasy migration through a classmate's affluent and dysfunctional family, then a new and awful home in the hinterlands of Las Vegas with his appalling father, where he forms a deep friendship with  a Russian teenager who is more an explosive force of nature than a literary invention. Tartt then returns Theo to the compassionate oversight of master furniture restorer Hobie and the girl, Pippa, who was also in the museum, and who captured Theo's attention before their two worlds were simultaneously destroyed in the terrorists' blast. The locations are rendered richly, flawlessly; they take on the weight of characters, really-particularly Las Vegas in the recession and Amsterdam in December, chilly, festive, with all the city's splendors and idiosyncrasies on display. Then there is New York, one of Tartt's homes. So much has been written about the city, but Tartt captured  small flashes of visions that we all see in New York, but never articulate, much less preserve in text. Often, Ihad to stop reading through to reexamine a sentence that seemed to describe something both familiar and entirely new and fresh, in language that reduced me to blithering envy of her craft. What an eye she has! The writing is superlative. Since it is publication week, I read a New Yorker review I considered completely churlish, and a New York Times review that simply didn't seem to be treating the novel with the immense gravitas it deserves. The Goldfinch has been called Dickensian, and perhaps it is; but it is also Tartt's completely original and achingly splendid creation. I loved this novel and will remember it forever, something I haven't said since To Kill a Mockingbird.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am not normally a big game player but I heard that Candy Crush was fun and what I heard was certainly right. Once you start it's very hard to put the game down! I guess the fact that you have to buy &#34;more lives&#34; when you run out of retries on a certain level actually helps me to put my Kindle down while I wait for a new life. I can see how it could certainly get very costly if you keep buying &#34;lives&#34; when you run out. I do love it though!!

B001U3Y5XE|3.0|Unlike Lego Creator the board game which my family loves (ages 5,6,11), Lego Creationary is too difficult for them because their is not guidance on how to build a design to look like your clue. Most of our guesses are way off, and the younger kids will take forever to try to imagine a design. They don't mind just building with the pieces in the box, but it is a frustrating game for them.

B004G7UTXG|2.0|The acting and scenery was great, but the story is depressing.  Even though the Franciscan Fathers were faithful, they were killed and only a small remnant of the tribe survived.  Nothing about the film was uplifting to me.  I suppose it was a lesson in history, but not one I would want to watch again.  Also, I had great difficulty streaming it.  Many long breaks during the film.

B00FKQ38OE|5.0|I agree - a master craftsman songwriter.<br /><br />I remember, back in the 60s 70s, a new Beatle song would come on the radio, & it always had that peculiar novelty about it - something like, &#34;That was clever - I never heard that little twist before&#34;. But then you'd hear it a few more times & you'd be incapable of thinking it could be any other way.<br /><br />I had that experience again when I heard &#34;New&#34; - new Beatle songs - pop music has changed again.<br /><br />Especially liked the song about their younger days, & the last song on the album is a killer - &#34;Sir Paul&#34; indeed!
B004SIP6ZE|4.0|I saw this film in theaters when I was a kid. I bought the VHS when it was released, which included a short (and final) interview with Brandon Lee at the end of the tape. Recently I have transferred all of my VHS to DVD, with the exception of the copy inhibited tapes (embedded in the code; not cost effective to purchase the bypass-device relative to the how many tapes were like this), which I have elected to just re-purchase on Amazon. The Crow is one example. The DVD set does not contain that interview. I have now purchased this movie twice simply for retaining that last interview so I can donate all of the (now out-of-date) VHS format tapes. This is no fault of the seller or Amazon (who I always advocate for). The DVD arrived quickly and in perfect condition. This is a movie I would recommend. I would just like to express my displeasure with Miramax for not including such an important piece of the puzzle on the DVD. I suppose I will check YouTube and try to pull it from there, if it's available..

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Just like &#34;The Deadline&#34; by DeMarco, this book takes to examining IT process and procedure through the veil of a narrative. And just like that book, The Phoenix project is an easy read because of it, while still giving valuable insight to the theme of the book. This book put forth the notion that DevOps is a movement of Dev, Operations, IT, and Security personnel all talking to each other and coordinating efforts to make their business thrive. It also suggests that IT is more than a department; that in our technology-focused world, IT is the heart of your business, an integral piece from payroll to product. These are the revelations demonstrated throughout the plotline of this book, with a lot of details and examples you'll likely encounter in your own business.<br /><br />While less revolutionary, this book also touches on Kanban and work flow (Lean principles) and how they apply to IT, something you can find in a lot of other books, but it is put in an interesting light in here with respect to seeing IT as core and center to your business. Overall an enjoyable book, if at times a little heavy handed and idealistic. A great book to add to your IT collection.

B000NY12LO|5.0|Another great book by Jodi Picoult. Kept me engrossed page after page, and always with a little twist at the end I  never saw coming. I'm now on a mission to read all Ms. Picoult's books which is a lofty goal since she has been very productive in the past years. Read it, it will give you a huges insight into bullies and those they bully.
B000FC130E|2.0|I tried reading this book.  I read one book a week.  The first two - three chapters constantly switch around from group of characters to group and give us little to care about.  It is confusing without being intriguing.  For the first time in 2 years, I  just quit reading the book.  Little character development and there is no character I felt like rooting for.
B007RX32TY|3.0|With this album, Chromatics have made a case for themselves as the premier tragic romantic band of their generation. On their previous album [[ASIN:B009YSLVHA Night Drive]], they picked up the lonely, echoing guitars of [[ASIN:B000042O1H post-punk]] and the sensuous pulse of [[ASIN:B00B0NCSJW techno]], and sang tales of romantic isolation during secluded nocturnal drives. At a certain age, to a certain personality, this is dynamite, absolutely irresistible. The songs were mostly great, too, and they did a phenomenal [[ASIN:B004VPAXHU Kate Bush]] cover that completely eclipsed the original.<br /><br />Kill For Love follows a similar blueprint. For example, it also contains a cover of an indie icon, this time [[ASIN:B000002KDG Neil Young]]. And, just like with \\"Running Up The Hill,\\" Chromatics' take on \\"Hey Hey, My My\\" is fantastic, better than the original. Ruth Radelet's soft, slow monotone reveals the bitter and defeated irony under the surface of Young's simplistic lyrics. \\"They give you this, but you pay for that\\" suddenly connotes weariness, as if the narrator is too tired to provide specifics, and knows that in any case you understand them anyway. Radelet's reading of \\"Rock and roll will never die\\" turns this phrase into an admission of its own pointlessness.<br /><br />This profoundly moving opening sets the tone. The album lacks a tight concept like Night Drive (which was exactly what the title said), but several other songs echo the feeling of being lonely and helpless that permeates the Young cover. \\"Back From The Grave\\" is quite open about this: \\"When I look at the sky / well I wish I was gone / because mother you're gone, and father you're gone / lover you're gone and other you're gone.\\" But Radelet sings these lines in an almost light-hearted tone, sounding puzzled or absorbed in thought, rather than desperate. One review called her vocal style \\"blank,\\" but I think this quality creates interesting tonal contrasts with the openly emotional lyrics and sexy techno production. She sings a line like \\"our dreams have all vanished now\\" (in \\"At Your Door,\\" a belated peak close to the end of the album) so calmly and matter-of-factly that it actually gains a certain authority, which then gives emotional charge to the more optimistic follow-up.<br /><br />There is also room for some fun songs in the \\"danceable post-punk\\" vein, that don't necessarily involve the same kind of catharsis. On the title track, Radelet lists important pastimes of tragic romantics, such as \\"I took a pill on a Saturday night,\\" and then sweetly intones, \\"But I killed for love,\\" set to shimmering, starry-eyed synths. Make-out city, baby! \\"The Page\\" is a little more muted lyrically, but the upbeat tempo and more dissonant guitar give it a more optimistic cast. And, on the other end, \\"Candy\\" and \\"A Matter Of Time\\" are completely unsubtle nobody-understands-me laments. In the latter, \\"you cried yourself to sleep again\\" is sung completely straight by Radelet, as swollen-eyed self-pity (still echoing and ethereal, though). This is where her detachment on the other songs pays off -- next to \\"Into The Black\\" and \\"Back From The Grave,\\" the sudden burst of emotion doesn't feel cheap.<br /><br />So, why only three stars? Well, Kill For Love has the same problem as Night Drive -- it's just too damn long. There's another completely forgettable fourteen-minute instrumental (\\"No Escape\\"), though, to be fair, it's a bonus track this time. But the album proper also has plenty of seven- and eight-minute tracks that probably could have been cut in half (or entirely) without doing any harm. Two tracks feature a male vocalist, who attempts to replicate Radelet's style with some sensitive vocoder falsetto. He's not terrible, but since he's basically doing the same thing that she does better (but with more production tricks), it's hard to see the point. Another track, \\"There Is A Light Out On The Horizon,\\" is basically an instrumental interlude with a sample of a moody voicemail message -- again, not inappropriate for the album, but not strictly necessary either. The music on these isn't bad, but it develops very slowly. I like how the piano in \\"These Streets Will Never Look The Same\\" is subtly reinforced by a faint post-punk guitar, but I don't think it needed eight minutes to get going. \\"Broken Mirrors\\" starts with an interesting dark-ambient sound, but then transitions to a more conventional disco rhythm, which already appears throughout the whole album, and is not substantially varied here. Just a bit later, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\" does the exact same thing: it starts with some interesting ambient strings, which quickly disappear in favour of repetitive, barely-there bass chords.<br /><br />Thus, Kill For Love is an overlong, meandering mess with a handful of terrific songs. Despite its faults, I'll recommend it anyway -- when they're on, they are absolutely the best at what they do. Their brilliant and enigmatic vocalist, and their evocative atmosphere, bring out an existential undercurrent in the old rock cliches that casts them in a new light.mail message -- again, not inappropriate for the album, but not strictly necessary either.

B00EXVZW6E|3.0|I prefer the older style hidden object games with a bit of a story line and lots of change-up in the graphics.  This one is just one screen after another of finding hidden objects with no particular purpose.  One positive note is that you can chose which type of hints you would like to use, but that gets old pretty quickly too.  Not a bad free app if you have lots of time to waste, but I wouldn't pay for it.
B00ECR7KX2|5.0|if you are a fan of Shakespear ... and a fan of Joss Whedon you are in love ... if you like one you are now a fan of the other. This is a GREAT version of this story and feels almost foreign since it's spoken straight from the pages of Shakespear. It's a great way to introduce these characters to a new generation and would be perfect in an English classroom as you read along with the text!
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|This novel continues the 'fast' thread of all his previous Reacher adventures.<br /><br />If you have read previous Reacher novels, you may be wondering when the character or the author will burn out.  Neither possibility seems to be imminent after reading this recent offering from Mr Child.<br /><br />I enjoyed this novel as much as all previous.  Jack Reacher seems to have outlived his nine-lives many times over and I do not object in the least.<br /><br />There are many (recent past) promotions of this series that hype up the macho image of central Reacher character.  Ignore these.  Jack Reacher is mellowing with age but also continues to display the summary personal judgement over life and death that is his to command.  By my lights within context of the novel itself he does not err in his decisions.<br /><br />Another spotless (and successful) formula offering from one of the leading thriller writers of recent times.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|This movie tried to combine every aspect of any possible movie. This was too perplexed and therefore the movie was over saturated and not worth the time or money spent to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is a fun, adicting (in a good way) and challenging!! You can play, put it down and come back to it without being lost as to where you left off!
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|Wallander mysteries are superior.<br />&#34;Dragon Tattoo&#34; of course lead me to the Wallander mysteries on PBS-<br />and so it goes, one after another- pure satisfaction.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Hard to beat and challenging fun and more my mom has it I have it even my grandma plays candy crush
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting for this game on kindle it is very interesting and will have you playing it over and over again, only thing I do not like is you have to pay for different things throughout the game. It would be better to charge one price for the game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is fun and challenging,once in awhile one of the levels can be boring but not often. Wish I could play Farm Heroes and Pet Farm on my Kindle. Waited a long time to play Candy Crush.
B004GYY714|3.0|I downloaded Tune In in order to have radio access in the event of a power outage. Software works good on both my Kindle Fire HD and my Samsung Galaxy 3 phone. But some local stations (Primary weather alert/news stations) are not available. Yes, still nice to have and use on occasions.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|dont read it and dont buy it! the ending is horrible!i would not spend money to read this dissappointment at all...spolier following............ tris dies....
B005D63ICI|3.0|Season 4 was the best with John Lithgow. The story became predictable and rather lame in the later seasons. Seasons 1-4 are worth the price though.
B008D30K7E|3.0|Expect the unexpected and just relax and enjoy this charming book ! Great read on a grey rainy day to bring in a little sunshine.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Extremely dark in plces, but the show is a tremendous success.  Amazing that the Glee producer is part of this series.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This was an awewsome read and spot on with the commentary on the liberal midea.  I hope Marcus Luttrell is still with the Seals and serving our country.  My family and I are very appreciative of his service.
0316247545|5.0|If you are a My Little Pony fan, this is a must have. It is very detailed, very colorful, and quite endearing for MLP fans. You won't be disappointed
B00BD99JMW|1.0|SPOILER<br />How can ANYONE give this book 5 stars. And im not just talking about the ending go back and reread Divergent and tell me this book is writing half as good. The 2 POV's poorly done half the time you forget who POV yoir reading as. For me Tris and Four had different personalitys and it didnt come across at all. Then you have all the what the ____ just happened. I'm sposed to believe Tris's mom who died for her in Divergent knew she was in danger and wouldnt try get her out of the city. Yet i have to believe Fours mom who never shiwed the slightest sign of loving ger son would be just ok i give i wont fight for the controll ive killed so many before because now i want a relationship with my son. That Peter that had no problem attacking someone in their sleep hanging Tris over a chasum never showing any remorse felt bad and wanted to start over um ya right. There was so much wrong with this book in terms of closing up lose ends with people doing things they never would have done at best this is a 2 star book. But you throw in Tris dieing for no reason it didnt change how you thought of her. It didnt change her charactor. It makes this book 1 star. Not to mention that Four lets her go with her brother to his sposed death right then i new she was dead that there was no way she would let someone die for her. But Four who knows her best dosent think shell take his place. Only good thing is Four didnt take memory serum but I SURE WISH I COULD. This book ruined the series for me. While i read mocking jay i got to the point i hoped they would kill off kattniss it was so bad. Read this hoping against hope it would be better and it was worse form now on im stoping at 2 in trilogys
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is still the master storyteller he ever was.  Great story with plenty of twists I didn't see coming.  I didn't find it all that terrifying, but suspenseful nonetheless.  In a few years we will be asking what happened with Abra and how she turned out.  But if Mr. King has yet another sequel in mind (which is rare, I know) I would like him to go back to Derry and bring back `ole Pennywise.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I saw it in the movies and couldn't wait for the DVD.  This is an amazing film.  Add it to your library.
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|I did not like it deleted it from my kindle. The game might be good for very young. I did not really check it out before purchase.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|This was a great purchase and does exactly what I needed it to do. Now I'm able to connect my computer monitor and the TV to the computer using this adapter. Prongs are strong and everything screws in tight. Can't go wrong with this purchase if you need to connect two VGA's to your computer.
B001706I5I|5.0|Great Christmas Movie!! One the whole family can enjoy, although the grinch could be a bit frightening to small children.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John green you are a genius but what you do is cruel. Why is this sooo good. It's crazy-amazing. And though the end is perfect, realistic , and the way that I wish more stories would end, unhappily in some ways. I still wish they could've been together longer, forever?<br /><br />I want to find an Augustus
B00358ESI4|5.0|I love this movie! How close is it to real life? I don't know, but I like to think there is compassion in leadership. Mel Gibson was awesome in this movie.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|It was good. A lot of political stuff. Not enough about Elisabeth. But it summed up all her drama. I'm glad I finished the series.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|I would have given this movie 4 stars but my boys loved this so much they watch it again. The smiles on their face got this film 5 stars from me.
B000063V8U|5.0|I would recommend this series to anyone who likes SiFi.  The complete set is a must. I watch the series once a year just because I Iike to.
B0030MKGKY|5.0|A friend at work told me this was the closest movie out there to what really happened. I loved it!
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I had to say season 4 was leaps and bounds better than season 3. The the entire season was very solid unlike season 3 which was uneven with a lot of hit and misses. I almost didn't watch season 4 but I'm glad I did. Some may call my words blasphemous when I say I loved the character Donna Nobel from start to emotional  finish. I am not a whovian by any stretch but I would say this is the quintessential series of the David Tennant run to watch
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The movie was great,the DVD was high quality !! I would recommend getting this movie.If you don't you will regret it !
B000002JOF|5.0|Bought this CD mainly for the song &#34;Texas&#34; and was very pleasantly surprised that the rest of the CD was equally enjoyable.  Not disappointed in the least!  I went from being a Chris Rea &#34;Texas&#34; fan to being a Chris Rea fan.
B0036S4B6M|2.0|I was deeply disappointed with this story. Although I like her style of writing the story lacked accountability for her crime. Her prison complaints made her seem winey. Her complaints of terrible food, no hair dryer and people being vulgar was a non story. She mentioned her blonde hair more times than her crime. I sincerely hope she contributes part of her proceeds to help women getting out that need it.
B00CIVLZ3U|4.0|Really good addition to Sandersons catalogue. Would of liked it to be part of a series however! Maybe as part of a trilogy?
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It won't even download. It keeps starting over when it gets to 52%. Do not get it. Not worth the time and effort!
B004PYWRQC|5.0|Good acting, Johnny Depp plays this role well. good interesting story keeps you engaged. I really liked it. Would recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have this game on both my iPhone and my kindle fire, obviously i love it! Its frustrating because each level has goals you must reach before going on to the next one. And OF COURSE it doesn't give you what you need, so you get to keep on trying; you can also go back to previous levels any time to try and get three stars or just play.  HOWEVER: I had to connect with Facebook to open I think the 37th level by asking friends for help.  I do not like to bother my friends for level tickets and more lives! I got the game to play when i want for as long as I want without bugging others!! I refuse to put money into it to get to higher levels so the only way I can do that is to connect to Facebook and be a Game Botherer.  That's why I only gave 4 stars.
B001RJTFP4|5.0|Wesley is an excellent actor and gives a great performance in the movie Blade. Plenty of action mixed in with just the right amount of  drama and a story line.
0316239909|5.0|The story of the development of Amazon into the super-company that it is is essentially the story of one man, Jeff Bezos. It is Bezos long- term vision,tremendous determination, innovativeness and business guts which are at the heart of this book. Putting the customer first, going outside the box to find the non-conventional solution to problems,willing to pay less attention to short- term profit and more to long- term development are at the heart of this story.<br />Stone does not in a way give us a deep portrait of Bezos in a psychological sense.Erik Erikkson would not feel confirmed by Stone's approach. He does not tell us about Bezos' childhood, and do more than hint at his relation to the biological mother and step-father who raised him. He does throw in a surprise at the end having done the detective work and revealed Bezos' identity to his biological father. But this story is incidental to the main tale which again is about Amazon's business development, Bezos original vision , his taking it through many challenges, including the Tech downturn and collapse of the company's stock in 2000-2001. In this particular crisis and other's the reader cannot help but being impressed by Bezos cool sticking to his values, and vision, his not panicking his not giving in to large and threatening competitors who would buy him out.<br />There are other sides to the story less flattering. Bezos is a legendary tough- boss who demands long- hours, total dedication, high-performance including innovativeness from his workers. The 'customer-comes- first' rule is not balanced by a corresponding consideration of the conditions of Amazon workers.<br />Stone repeatedly makes the point that Amazon is really a reflection of the brain of Bezos. In one anecdote in which there is conflict between Amazon and Apple Stone explains that IPod's music supremacy and Amazon's relative failure came because Jobs was great music-lover and Bezos indifferent to Music. The other side of this is that Bezos according to Stone 'devours books' while they were not a great habit of Jobs. There is another parallel between the two super-entrepreneurs as both of them had tech-fiend friends responsible for the early innovations who later left the business. Stone does give portraits and tell stories of key Amazon employees through the years and show how Bezos could be especially generous to them.<br />I have touched upon in this review very few of the major questions and considerations raised by this book. Jeff Bezos is famous for his adversarial approach to problems and there certainly have been and are many questions raised by Amazon's present conduct of its business. As a long- time Amazon reviewer  I on the one hand believe they show consideration in ways many traditional publishers do not. Bezos idea of enabling all the creative work possible, of removing the gatekeepers has been of great help to many including myself. On the other hand there is the question of whether Amazon treats fairly content- providers who receive no compensation for their work. There are sites that pay for book- reviews while Amazon does not. On the other hand I can see the point that paying would rob the review of a certain integrity and objectivity.<br />PS<br />1) People who are interested in business and how business deals work and are made will love this book<br />2) As Bezos allowed Stone to interview the people around him but did not agree to being interviewed by Stone the book lacks a dimension of inwardness<br />3) The book reveals an overall grand-plan and strategy for Amazon to replace Waltons as the number one retailer in the world. To do this Bezos believes they must go into the Apparel and Food businesses.<br />4) The Kindle has changed the world and destroyed something of the book - world I and so many love. This is not raised as a moral issue, but it is quite clear that if it hadn't been the Kindle it would have been something else. The Technology simply was getting to the point, and people were working on this kind of development. One of the many interesting stories of the book is how the Riggios of Barnes and Noble got it wrong, and Bezos got it right  in regard to electronic reading devices.<br />5) Again this book is a well- worth- reading tribute to a remarkbly creative business figure who has in my opinion done much more good than harm.<br />PS I am a bit less enthusiastic about this book after Jeff Bezos' wife Mackenzie Bezsos  reviewed the book and claimed it is filled with factual inaccuracies. I am less convinced however by her total defense of her husband in regard to relations to workers.nd people were working on this kind of development. One of the many interesting stories of the book is how the Riggios of Barnes and Noble got it wrong, and Bezos got it right  in regard to electronic reading devices.<br />5) Again this book is a well- worth- reading tribute to a remarkbly creative business figure who has in my opinion done much more good than harm.<br />PS I am a bit less enthusiastic about this book after Jeff Bezos' wife Mackenzie Bezsos  reviewed the book and claimed it is filled with factual inaccuracies.

B003QS9WIE|2.0|generally into all the actors in it, like period too. but the movie was just boring. i wanted to like it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story was amazing, and I learned that it was based on a true story.  Very well written. I highly recommend it.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|This movie was not great, the special effects were cool, but the acting was not great and the storyline was terrible.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Another Team Lava game I just love. The more players you get to join you as your neighbors the better. For tips and gifts. I recommend this app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited about the best game finally being available!! I have been waiting for months and cant put it down!
1476734941|3.0|I was able to get through the book fairly quickly. Easy to understand. Sounds liek a realistic plan to follow. Cant wait to get results/
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was an easy read and a page turner.  The characters were well developed and realistic.  In the end, I still don't feel certain about Jacob's innocence or guilt - a powerful way to end the book.  I will definitely read other books by this author.
B005F96UNM|4.0|The DVD arrived quickly and because it's Blu-ray the picture was great.  The movie is also good.  Like another reviewer pointed out, the first part is a bit distracting but once you get past that the movie is enjoyable.  I liked it.  The actors are all good actors so that's probably why.
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|It has been my experience, not only with Sci-fi but with most shows, that it takes a couple seasons for them to find their legs, i.e, their strengths, weaknesses, what works, what doesn't.  Enterprise included.  The third season they finally figured it out and it is one of the finest seasons of star trek anywhere.  The overall one story arc kept things tense and interesting and the characters finally came into their own.  Unfortunately, it was too late and they got their pink slip the next season.
B009XIXVU6|1.0|I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Sun's. BUT I did not enjoy this book at all... I understand what role each character played to the other, but I didn't sense the importance in those relationships. This story was all about loss and pain and missed opportunities. It offered only a glimmer of the happiness each character could have had but never truly did. I don't feel that every book has to have a happily ever after ending but this book was a total drag. Add to that that each individual story was unnecessarily drawn out.  It actually hurts me to say it but I do not recommend this book at all,... unless you're looking to be depressed.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Mitchell is hugely entertaining.  He has a marvelous grip of the language. His literary talent is amazing  .Cloud Atlas was very ambitious.
B005S39YGU|5.0|I'm a recent Big Bang Theory fan and am going to thoroughly enjoy catching up on all the seasons!  And now I will own them, too!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I always loved my Kindle, but now I'm IN LOVE with my Kindle! Thank you for finally getting on the ball! Now all we need is Bitstrips to come aboard! WHOO HOO!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the first and only actual video game that I have played on my kindle, finally something worth my money!!
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Better than the sequel.  all these actors work together well.  It's nice to see a film where all the action heroes are not in their twenties or thirties.  this was a real joy to watch, even my kids liked it.
B0063M22QO|3.0|It could give you more games to play, instead they want you to unlock and buy more games, Need a little more fun in it.
0738711500|5.0|I wanted to learn Tarot Cards.. this is a great beginning! The cards are beautiful and easy to read. I would recommend this in a heartbeat.
B001TH16DI|5.0|For Star Trek-ies and nerds alike, you'll love this movie. It has great action (even for those who do not know the Star Trek saga) and special effects.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|We looked all over in stores for this movie, and couldn't find it.  Finally found it on the Internet.  Our whole family enjoys this movie.
B006INDGFE|2.0|I was disapointed in this one , Not as well done has the first 2 movies. I thought it dragged out.
B000UO338W|3.0|Suprising lack of almost anything industrial is my  big complaint. If you like the many different sounds of Ministry though you might like this album (and the other two that complete their Bush-era trilogy). For me I enjoy the more atmospheric & heavy industrial Ministry to this.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|The puzzles repeat after a few rounds of this game, which is good because you do have to read fast in order to figure out what you're supposed to do here.  game graphics have nice bold colors and cute drawings, but the speed of play made this NOT fun for me.  I uninstalled after a good 10 minutes of this.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Absolutely love this game! Only wish there were games for every character that you earn. Note: you can turn off the plane game in Settings if your device doesn't detect blowing.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is a lovely account of the coming to life of a girl, a boy, and a family because of a secret garden and its magic.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Sad that just when the show started hitting its stride that it ended, but the show was a really great show!
B00DW39B2K|4.0|It was a good movie worth the watch. I would not classify it as a great movie, but still had a good storyline.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|The other day I was placing an order for the new 3d movies and came across this. No, it's not in 3d (too bad) but it was shown with them and not knowing anything about it and given it's star power, I said \\"give it a try\\". Glad I did. What a surprise. At first I thought it was just a big and beautiful version of a movie I had seen about ten times, then something happened. It changed. It became a different movie. It might not be the most original Sci Fi (not the channel) movie I've seen, but, it's close. It's a shocker and it's haunting and will leave you thinking long after it's done. Think Waterworld meets Moon meets The Twilight Zone. It's so cool and what a music track! Buy it, rent it, see it. You'll be glad you did.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app it's easy for the whole family to use and we can set multiple alarms and it gives weather updates and it also looks cool.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|I was very surprised to discover that this was NOT filmed in 3d, but a conversion. It contained so many \\"in your face gimmicks\\" I had so many spears, rocks, laser beams, pieces of ships and even human bodies hauled at me I thought I might never get cleaned up. This is a ACTION movie first and foremost. After the first half an hour I begin to think the script was simply \\"RUN, SCREAM, RUN, RUN, SCREAM and KEEP RUNNING! Oh it did have a story (somewhere) but RUNNING seems to be the most important aspect of the movie. A very long time ago I wrote letters to Paramount to stop them from cancelling the original show after it's second season. I've been a Trekkie a looong time and I'm so glad that it has not died. BUT I don't like this movie or where it's headed and I'll give you three reasons why. Kirk, Spock and McCoy. Hard to believe since these were the reasons I loved the original. This new Kirk is a JERK, an a..h... and just down right ugly..he's a spoiled brat! Spock, he's just freaky looking and McCoy, well he seems just pointless. You have no idea how many times I wished this movie had been about Captain Pike, now there's a Starfleet member I could look up to, and they kill him! This new crew doesn't know if they're coming or going, just RUN! We'll think of something later. I do have to say I enjoyed the fight between Spock and Khan, but that's about it. Had a real problem with \\"just set outside the Neutral Zone, fire your torpedoes and get\\" Let's see, you fly a few thousand light years, stop and fire your weapons at a site a few million miles away even if you're not sure it's your real target. Sounds an awful lot like the Iraq War. But then Wood does seem to want revenge and a war very bad. No didn't like the movie, but the 3d is great, oh and Carol Marcus...she'd make a great Powergirl! Very disappointed in how things have changed, but I'm sure there will be another one, maybe this time they'll get a director who isn't so much into RUNNING!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Typically British movie of the repertory variety with well-known and highly talented actors. What makes the movie, among other things, is the inclusion of older musicians and singers who enjoyed remarkable careers in their respective fields.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Been waiting for this for awhile. Now they finally got it. So addictive and fun. I highly recommend it for anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really fun and keeps you thinking. I really enjoy this and so does my mom!!! I am still playing and every level is different and interesting.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Great characters. Good story line. I spent the summer watching all the seasons. I suggest it to anyone who is looking for a new show to watch.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|It took time to get into this book.  It was uplifting as I got into it. The subject matter could have been depressing ,however it was written in such a manner that  the author  handled it with a tremendous amount of  sensitivity and  surprisingly it was a beautiful, tender read.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|For the price this is where to go.  It is more anywhere else.  Perfect time to grab it for the second one just came out.
B00C1B28Y2|5.0|Looks awesome. It actually looks like Goku and is fairly cheap compared to some of the other ones located a Amazon.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I would have given this game 5 stars. It had fantastic graphics and an interesting story line that was totally original from any I've seen so far. No glitches at all. Challenging puzzles and scenes. My only problem was that at the cost of $4.99, the game is extremely short. It seems rushed at the end too. So, great game if you have money to burn and like to finish quickly.
B00F87ZUYG|4.0|Story is good but the walkers made more gross this season, little too bloody but like I said still like the story line.
B000VCLGBY|5.0|I have enjoyed Reese Witherspoon in her many antics in the funny movies she's done.  It is fun to watch the 'typical' blond get into Law School and do better then most.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this game is very addicting. once you start you can't stop. I like the different levels the game has. keep them coming.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is one of those books that kept me from doing anything.  I read it whenever I could and when I wasn't reading it, I was thinking about it.  I just LOVED it!  Nothing I would change, nothing I didn't like. Get it.....read it....obsess over it!
B000SC245E|5.0|After many thousands of sheets my belt unit was up for replacement.<br />This part was an identical part and the original and is performing up to standard!
B002RPK1P0|4.0|Undoubtably a good movie. It's a very early sci-fi flick so, needles to say, the effects don't come close to recent movies. The story is simple and well structured and the acting is solid. In my opinion one of this movie's strengths is the symbolism. Though the movie takes place in the future, it has many references to problems that are faced every day like conformism, deforestation, morality, and the struggle of humanity to hang on to their ideals in the face of adversity. I was actually recommended this movie by a friend and I'm satisfied but I wouldn't call it a &#34;must watch&#34;
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love it is filly fun you can make them houses and also baby animals.  you also can do any thing you want to do on that game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is about time king games!! Thank you for bringing magical candy land to the kindle! Now you just have work on pet rescue :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|All my peers and grandchildren love this game, they encouraged me to get it. When I go to the doctors office and have to wait, I play this game. You can become addicted.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|I have just finished this book and i'm starting on the next one and so far I love love love all of them I'm just wanting to get them all read as fast as I can just to see what happens next
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Measures your ability to project speed and location of the target, practice til you get it right, do not get angry, smile!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|awesome device for streaming movies and youtube and netflix if you don't have a dedicated box for your tv. hopefully google will add extra features soon
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I was totally in love with this trilogy, and completely psyched for Allegiant, but let me tell you, IT'S NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Obviously *SPOILER ALERT* I was heartbroken and have cried for hours on end for Tris's death, but let me just say, it was expected. Miss Roth has clued us in, seeing as she sent Tris to her death before, but I, personally, never believed that she would go to \\"that area\\" of writing. But let me just say, it was not a happy ending, with Tobias dying as well in the end, and they meet up in Heaven and live happily ever after the end. Oh no, he's alive, heartbroken, most likely to never love again. Yay! Not.<br /><br />Divergent was amazing and fresh. A new idea, a new discovery for the ages, something I expected to end up being a classic.<br /><br />I was severely disappointed in Insurgent. Tris was very bland, afraid, and naïve. But yet, I truly liked the book because it answered somethings key to the story's plot.<br /><br />Allegiant was the worst mistake ever. Tris AND Tobias's POV? Ok, Tris is dead. But let's just say I thought optimistically and had a spark of hope that Tris would be fine as fresh pie. And, and let's not forget that the way the book is devised just plainly, well... sucks. It is monotone, bleak, and if not for the captions that say Tris or Tobias then I would be like: ooh! Tris's POV! Wait... no... It's Tobias...<br /><br />Let's not forget how it all ends:<br /><br />\\"Be brave.\\"<br /><br />Even if Tris did die and Tobias survived, the ending could have been more assertive and powerful, filled with meaning and inspiration.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This is the funniest game I have ever had and it is challenging because it teaches you to act fast and use you're brain power!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|When I am at school it always has the word I need to be looking up. Works when I'm bored at home too. Has no flaw I have found yet. Comes free on kindle fire, and is very useful to have on your tablet.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Its a great hunting game<br />For any type of hunter young or old good or bad it still the best hunting game iv ever played
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Visual arts are great! But the end kind of stumps people. I like how the movie applied mystery with the Sci-Fi atmosphere
B00EUVG3P6|5.0|Very impressed with this processor! Currently testing it out for gaming and it performs decently well(paired with a msi radeon 7870 hawk). Its a good processor for the time being until your able to afford something better. I see this CPU as \\"The little CPU the could\\".
B007MB5OCE|5.0|A centenarian's life full of comedy-like coincidences,traverses de rwentieth century meetting on a personal basis the great leadrs.Full of philosophy and commedy.A book made to laugh and think.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so excited. this is a game I have been trying to play for months to see what was so good and I am on the band wagon!  I would recommend this over and over again! thank you for bringing it to amazon! You will be dreaming about this game in your sleep!
B00FPH6M82|1.0|This movie had a lot of potential.  However, it disappointed at every turn.  Not even good acting could save a poorly written and executed story line.  Could have been so much more.  Don't waste your money or time.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|It's a pretty good game for all ages.<br />I like this game because it's a sling shot game.<br />Trying to shot pig's is a blast
0316228583|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this well-written examination on life, politics, and relationships in small town England. Have never read J. K. Rowling before so no preconceived notions of old styles and content.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It's a nice little Brad Pitt vehicle. He's pretty to look at and there are a certain number of scary, fast-moving zombies.  But the book had a much more global perspective, the richness of India's docks, the battle of Yonkers, suburbia invaded, Japan's survival...There is just so much more in the book than one actor can carry. Read the book and wait for an excellent mini-series that reflects the book better.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|I've loved reading the books and it was hard for me to imagine that justice could be done to this gigantic story, but the authenticity and fidelity are truly beyond words.  Bravo to these wonderful people who, taking a page out of Peter Jackson's playbook, have surrounded this story with true lovers of the work; people who have poured their passion out into their work and created a world as real as that created by the author.  The casting is excellent and the set decoration is rich, detailed and authentic.  I am thoroughly enjoying this series and look forward to what comes next.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|Gaiman creates his usual spooky, gently menacing atmosphere, but his characters don't inspire the same level of sympathy as his other novels.<br /><br />I got the audio book, read by Neil himself, and found him to be pleasing to the ear, but slightly OTT in places.
B007EC27QM|2.0|I downloaded and tried it and it is not better than the calculator than came with my phone so I uninstall it.  I would use if it is free but I don't think it is worth if you have to pay for it.
B00571F26Y|2.0|I read it and even gave it a shot, it didn't work for me.  If it worked for others, God bless them.
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|Ah. The Black Eagle Inn really is the most beautiful book I've read in a long time. The third of The Three Nations Trilogy (and I can highly recommend the other two in the series, The Luck of the Weissensteiners and Sebstian) it is written just as engagingly, with wonderful characters, fabulous story, and a unique perspective.<br /><br />The Black Eagle Inn is set in Bavaria, at the end of World War II, and deals with a country that has been brought to its knees. How refreshing to read a different take on it all! And how well done the theme of redemption throughout the country and its citizens as a new way of being has to come into play for both country and populace to move on.<br /><br />Christoph Fischer is an excellent writer, and he chose to tell this marvellous story through the medium of a family saga (and boy, is he good at that). So we are introduced to the matriarch, Anna, and her relations, and her wealth - the inn itself, together with restaurant and large farm.<br /><br />Money, family, religion, politics, sexuality, forbidden love, scheming, plotting, hate and scandals engulf Anna, and all of these are mirrored in what is happening within the country too, a very clever thing to do for those readers (myself included) who wouldn't previously have known what life was like in Germany at the time.<br /><br />But it is not heavy-going, quite the opposite, as you are caught up in what is happening to the family - the book is quite the page-turner.<br /><br />And the redemption that I mentioned at the start of the review, of which the author has written so eloquently? Well, if you are willing to change, things will change around you and you can embrace those new things; if you don't, you are sure to be left behind. And I don't think there's much more you can say to make a case for humanity than that.<br /><br />An excellent read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Perfect little game that you can play here and there when you've got some dead time. Strangely addictive. Can get extra lives from face book friends as well.
B004132HZS|5.0|I gave this a 5 star rating because I am very pleased with the story adaptation, acting, and clever use of technology.  The DVD is a well done and has thoughtful commentary which was fun to hear.  I am pleased to have this in my Sherlock Holmes Collection and highly recommend it.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|This book is clearly timely and its content is no surprise given where Eggers' resides. He gives us an interesting protagonist who rather rapidly grows from being multidimensional, wide eyed, and someone with whom we can relate - as we learn about and take in the Google-like campus along with her - to someone who has drunk the kool-aid and reminds us of the not so paranoid reactions our current culture has engendered among the majority of us who have of course noticed the increasing social autism among our population and monopoly-like business models among our tech companies. The book is quick to draw you in and it is both frustrating that the protagonist isn't getting fairly obvious plot points that other characters seemingly shout at her at every turn, and also realistic as such concerns so often go unheard by those we know in real life re: the possible impacts of our tech-obsessed zeitgeist. Unfortunately the ending feels rushed and it seems as though there is quite a lot more Eggers could have done with the ending, but it does pack a 1984 conclusive punch that I'm sure few others will have a problem with.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|Loved this cd and all the tracks on it.  You just can't go wrong with ZZ Top.  If you're a fan, I'd recommend this cd.  Thank you to the seller for the fast delivery, too.
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Although very action packed, great plot and good special effects, I just feel it missed the boat somehow.<br />I thought it was a bit devious using constant rainy wet scenes which surely hide any imperfections in FX.<br />Perhaps the 3D version was more impressive but things got kind of repetitious.<br />wanted to like it more than I did.
B00E193Y36|5.0|One of my husbands favorite groups, he just saw them live in concert. This album has some live recordings as well and they are just as great as the recorded ones done in a studio.
B00EDG2LWC|2.0|First off, I didn't buy this book.  I rented it from the library.  Second, I wanted to like this book.  I really like JK Rowling as an author.  I think she is a good one.  But man was I disappointed in this book and in her.  She seemed to take every bad thing about humanity and put it into one book about one small town, and killed off the one &#34;good&#34; man in the whole story. (And no, that wasn't a spoiler.  You learn that he dies from the cover.)<br /><br />She used crude and lewd language and humor to portray the debauchery and frailties of humans.  I wish she would have used her talents and influence as an author to write something more uplifting, or at the very least left us with a good ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so glad Candy Crush Saga is finally available for the Kindle Fire!  The graphics are great, no glitches and it can be linked up with your FB play.  I like playing it on my kindle much more than the computer!
B002LVVCQM|5.0|A truly outstanding and interesting volume about how life on earth developed with clear and concise explanations. I strongly recommend it.
0143124544|5.0|What can i say that hasn't already been said? When I first heard about this book , I thought it sound like a cliche - let me tell you - there is nothing cliche about the writing, storylines or characters in this book. This book was fantastic - deeply moving and a powerful story . I am already looking forward to reading more by JoJo Moyes
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Noir-esque, Very tonal. Great acting. Well-paced. Rich plot. Wonderful camera work. Anyone who likes Inspector Foyle, Inspector Morse, Endeavor, Wallender, or Breaking Bad will like this.
006202406X|1.0|I have been eagerly anticipating this book for months! I even bought the hard cover so I could share with friends - After devouring it - I unfortunately have to say that it is going straight in the recycle bin ! It was SUCH a disappointment ! Divergent was excellent Insurgent held out promise for a fantastic ending to this exciting series - Allegiant was a complete letdown - was this the same author who had strong characters, and a strong, compelling story line in her first book?  If you loved the beginning of this series - then don't read this book- it left a bad taste in my mouth
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game already. I've heard so much about this game and was anxious for it to get to Amazon for my kindle and finally it's here. I tried the other games that were suppose to be like candy crush, but I grew bored quickly and they will now be uninstalled. Got to go play now lol .

B00C5R8364|5.0|This was my first Frederick Forsyth novel, and was recommended by a friend. The action never stops, and the hero Mitch Rapp was tops. It's unfortunate that Mr. Forsyth passed away, as I would be looking for more.

B0090SI582|1.0|just DO NOT BUY.... teach 20th fox a lesson, if fox makes a ton of money packaging this bluray this way other film studios will follow..what if paramount had released world war z extended or hansel and gretal extended only in a 3d package ? we all end up spending more. if it doesn't sell they will think again next time there's a big extended bluray. I for one won,t be buying....F.Y.I..the cover displayed is wrong the bluray dvd combo pack only contains the theatrical release, if you want the unrated cut you HAVE TO BUY THE 3D PACK,  more info on bluray.com
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it! it is so fun to play, but I think that it should only cost ONE gem EACH TIME. Other than that, its the best!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a great follow to Fall of the Giants.  To follow the families into the next generation is a treat.

B005CRQ3RK|5.0|My review of the book diary of a wimpy kid the last straw by Jeff Kinney is that it must have taken Jeff Kinney months to finish this amazing book.  The book was written with superior judgement  when it came to the language of the diceplen so if a blind person wher to read this amazing book they would get a perfect visual picture of the characters in the book. IN CONCLUSION Of this amazing book diary of a wimpy kid in my opinion this is a perfect five star book.
1594202273|5.0|This book by Eric Schlosser is a masterpiece that is the result of years of investigative research. The truth and suspense that Schlosser brings to this subject matter is intense and gives you a first row seat as to what went on many times with our nuclear arsenal. Written with the finesse of a fiction writer Schlosser brings the truth about the history of nuclear weapons in the United States.  A well written factual account that is easy to read because of his elegant style. It will keep you on the edge of your seat.

B003U6BE8I|4.0|I am a fan of Chris Columbus and The Harry Potter series. I wanted to see how they compared with each other. I personally thought, the Percy Jackson movies were not quite as good or up to the same level as the Potter films. The Percy Jackson films are still very good and I should not be comparing them anyway.

B005WUHAX8|1.0|I was anxious to receive this for my iPhone.  When I put the cover on, I couldn't hear the ringer or anything else for that matter.  You have to unscrew a little plastic screw at the top to plug in your headphones.  This is easy to misplace, as it's so small.<br />I ended up returning it and put on my old otter box that is broke on the side.  Still better protection and I can actually hear incoming calls and texts!
1568363931|4.0|When I ordered this book, I really wanted a full color book. Each full bento is in color, which is really nice, but some of the pictures on following pages are not in color. Otherwise this is an excellent book. Even if you are trying to make lunches for someone who does not like Japanese food, this book has other options. The book is easy to follow, and lets you know how long each box will take to make. And the website behind it has so many great ideas as well.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I bought this for my grandson who loves anything and everything Star Trek.  It was one of his birthday gifts.<br />He was so excited to see this movie.  Amazon you made another person happy, it arrived on the perfect day.
B000LB7G00|3.0|On the software side it would be better if the controls were fully configurable. I tried using it with a program called freecad, and some of the controls were backwards. I could not alter the controls to make it do what I wanted. On the hardware side it could either be heavier, or the up return spring lighter. I find that as I pull up on the control knob and turn to rotate, the whole assembly can rotate and then the other controls do not work as one would expect until I repositinn the mouse so that the side switches are back at the 3 and 9 o'clock position.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Although the format of this work, (he says, she says) is clever and fast paced; the main characters are so flawed, it is hard to like them at all.<br />I can appreciate the talent of the author, but it is hard given the nature of the protagonists.

B00AFROVQC|1.0|I sadly don't recommend this book to anyone. it seems like too many ideas were thrown together instead of developing them into anything good
B009WUAK2M|3.0|It was a typical shoot them up.  Guy movie.  Entertaining to say the least, but the plot was a few creative marbles short.  The cameos by certain actors was funny.

B001BANK32|4.0|After seeing the movie recently I was intrigued enough to check out the book. Never having been a big King fan I was apprehensive, but really enjoyed this book.<br /><br />The top horror book I have read. Highly recommended.

B00DZJ82TY|5.0|The reason that I passed on the deluxe box set is that it felt like there would be too many goods chasing too few dollars. However, I felt entitled to some extra goodies and the second disc of alternate versions and outtakes gives a fuller sense of how a classic album came to fruition. Nothing smacks of bottom-of-the-barrel quality. For instance, \\"Caravan\\" and \\"Glad Tidings\\" do offer glimpses of his creative process. \\"Moondance\\" (Take 22), fluteless and in a different key, is even jazzier than the standard release. But the biggest standout is his jumpy version of \\"I Shall Sing\\" (Take 7), originally released commercially by Art Garfunkel. And, just like his 1989 classic \\"Have I Told You Lately\\", later done by Rod Stewart, Van has always been his own aptest interpreter. Also of interest is an early attempt (Take 5) of \\"I've Been Working\\" done as a long blues. He'd later define it on \\"His Band and the Street Choir\\", but it's a fine work-in-progress here.<br /><br />But what really seals the deal is the newly remastered original album itself. Using my original 1990 CD copy as a direct comparison, the strides in audio technology make it much brighter without losing an iota of its dynamic range. The acoustic guitars and saxophones on \\"Caravan\\" and \\"Into the Mystic\\" have never sounded this vibrant before. There's also that fullness and warmth that I haven't heard since it was on vinyl. Even after 43 years, I marvel at his meticulous songwriting and self-production  and they still have that ambience that anybody can connect to.<br /><br />Despite Van's furious dismissal of this release, I have no problem ponying up the dough for this 2-CD edition. This is one of the greatest albums ever made and it's on this record that Van prodded the essence of his band and he succeeded tremendously in bringing his soul-band fantasy into reality.<br /><br />P.S. I specifically reviewed the Expanded 2-CD version, however, it shows that I also reviewed it under the link to the Deluxe 4-CD/1 Blu-Ray version too. It's a glitch that Amazon hasn't rectified.Blu-Ray version too. It's a glitch that Amazon hasn't rectified.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The chromecast was something of a impulse buy on my part, something I generally am against. However, this time it worked out for me very well.<br /><br />The little device does one thing - stream media from the following applications (on android) to your television via hdmi:<br />Netflix<br />Hulu<br />Google Play (including Google Music)<br />YouTube<br /><br />Also, Chrome for PC can stream a tab to the device (making most webpages possible streaming sources)<br /><br />This list is assured by G to grow over time, something that will be a welcome addition. However, even without that, at this price point its a perfect Netflix box, and the YouTube functionality is excellent. I will be welcoming 3rd party support form Plex et. al., but until that time it still has a very solid selection of media outputs to enjoy.<br /><br />If you need a Netflix box, I would give it a serious consideration. Its a snappy little device that has been very useful around my house.
B000F8O2OM|5.0|As always, excellent show!  I wish there were longer descriptions of the episode on the menu.  All it has is the title, not always helpful if you are looking for something specific and don't remember the exact title.

B008KNUKVI|2.0|Let me begin by saying this review focuses on the Amazon product, not Pentatonix.<br /><br />I love this group, but I cannot recommend purchasing this album ON AMAZON. The same album on iTunes includes a cover of \\"We Are Young,\\" which is not only a great cover but gives additional value to your purchase by increasing the song count to 7. Making matters worse, the \\"We Are Young\\" cover can only be obtained through purchase of the entire album on iTunes, so if you're thinking of picking up PTX Vol. 1 here and then grabbing the one-off from iTunes, think again.<br /><br />Again, I love the group, but this album on Amazon is obviously the inferior offering. I wish there was a glaring 1 or 2 star review that had directed me to iTunes for the purchase before I bought my copy.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|If Clint is in it I'm going to watch it. Love this one. He cranky old man portrayal is some good acting.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book lived up to my expectation of Stephen King.  Rich characters engaged in impossible situations that suck the reader in and become somehow believable. It did not have the abject horror of The Shining but revisited it in gripping detail.
B008476HBM|5.0|The book is wonderful and one that you will want to read more than once. Then the movie is also very very good. But please read the book before you try to view the movie so you will understand it better. Love the old classic books that I started reading when I was 12.

B00F880BWG|4.0|Reminds me of an HBO drama sometimes, spoon feeds you the drama dripping with more drama.  But other than that, good stuff: edge of your seat, mystery, sneaky, spooky.  Oh yeah, sometimes, not always, the facts just don't add up; blood causes infection but if you wear a shirt covered in blood you're fine. Situations like that just make it hard for me to totally get sucked in, but that's me.
B00DIFARQ6|3.0|It's a decent game.  It will keep you occupied for a bit.  Especially if you are bored waiting for your plane to arrive to the terminal.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Dialogs are smart and quick and plots are always intriguing. Definitely one of the best options available on Amazon Prime
B003G8WI7G|4.0|Infectious and captivating, this collection of strong songs transcends the genre. It's great music, and whether you listen to horn rock or not, it will cause your rump to shake in spite of yourself. Give in to it!
B003MX6QPU|5.0|This movie is not the usual romantic comedy, it is so much more. It is funny at times but it also gets harsh. It tries to depict life and love for what they are!!!
1401938906|5.0|I love this book! Not since I first read Creative Visualization by Shakti Gawain almost 25 years ago have I been this excited. Shakti's book changed the course of my life when I put her principals into practice and the same thing has happened here with Pam Grout's &#34;experiments.&#34; Her funny and relaxed writing style draws you in but the message is quite serious and powerful. I highly recommend this book for all &#34;seekers&#34; who get discouraged and begin to doubt their own power. I also recommend this book for all enlightened folks who want to have fun proving up their beliefs. These experiments definitely prove them!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'm a junkie. I've got an entire bookshelf of just his stuff, and I devour it.<br /><br />This one's a little different though, as we spend much of our time with the antagonists, and get to see their failures and triumphs, as well as little Danny Torrence (from The Shining). I really enjoyed the book, which I'd say is less horror and more supernatural suspense this time around, but that's a given. If you like King's other books involving psychics (Firestarter, Carrie, Everything's Eventual, the Dark Tower series), you'll probably like this.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Not as compatible as advertised. Will not let you go to full screen if your watching a video in chrome browser
B00CXLQG0M|4.0|I anxiously awaited this gun's release date, because I wanted it for an event. Lucky for me, it shipped about 5 days before said event, and all was well.<br /><br />I own both this and the Hammershot, the &#34;boy&#34; version decked out in orange&black &#34;zombie-killing&#34; style. Both are great guns, but for me, the tattoo-like design of the Sweet Revenge was just a tad cooler.<br /><br />Pros: the Hammer! Being able to fire this one-handed is awesome, pure and simple. Small hands might have a harder time cocking the hammer, but otherwise, this is great.<br /><br />Cons: No quick way to reload, like with a modified maverick or strong-arm, but this is minor.<br /><br />I found the gun pretty accurate, but mostly, it's a tons of fun.<br /><br />This &#34;kit&#34; comes with some glasses and a holster; I didn't use either, but both are quite usable. The holster is just a clip-on-the-belt though, it doesn't have a full loop. It's got room for 3 rounds.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Very entertaining, very stylish, I enjoyed it as much as the first one, I really like the relationship between Captain Kirk and Spoc
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its a really fun game, TOTALLY worth $7.00<br />please pleas please! Upload the skin craft on Here though,<br />that would make the game SO much more fun.<br />that's the only thing that I ask :)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the Kite Runner and this book is even better. Hosseini blends stories of many characters to weave throughout decades of transitiioning lives that intersect. He blends poverty and wealth and the impact of that great divide. His storytelling keeps you turning pages but wanting to slow down as not to finish and end the book. An underlying theme is beauty can be a curse....
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I guess this book is okay but I have read better. I think it is worse than the other 6 books. It is just... random I guess. My favorite is the 2nd book
B002O2THVA|4.0|The only reason that I did not give 5 stars was for picture quality.  Specifically, the film is in black and white.  There are great moral lessons in this movie.  There are times when Jimmy Stewart could have easily given up, but he faced his fears and accomplished great things.  John Wayne made several sacrifices, and he helped someone even though it had a high cost for him.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|As always with BP pretty good movie, too many special effects for me but nice scenario. To see this winter when it is cold outside!
B000FC1HBY|3.0|I enjoy the book but I find too many characters.  It made it hard to remember who was who.  It reminds me of the story of the Vikings.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We love this game!it's so much fun and it just keeps getting harder. Lol we play all the time I can't believe how long we waited to play.
B00742H26M|5.0|Excellent well acted. Loved the young Jonny. Story is romantic. Quite enjoyed the time period and settings. Would watch again
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this app because of the way it starts u with enough energy and the money flow allows u to collect money fast enough to not actually have to spend any actual money in the app store to keep it games going like most other games of this stock it has its negatives but nothing if run across so far worthy of elaborating on I consider this a good game
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|Great the way the movie unfolds and the narration by Henry Hill brings you up to speed on Henry's family, background, and the characters he wants to emulate.
B00004XPPE|5.0|10-22-013  This is the leaderin the newly created&#34;What if, thrillers&#34; list of movies and I'llreview it now.  The film is the 1966 suspense movie &#34;Faiksafe,&#34;starring Dan O'Herlihey, Larry Hagman, Edward BinnsWalter Mattheauw and frank Overton and introducing fritz Weaver.  There is averysmall ladies role, with Hildy stark, as general Black'swife.  The filmbegins at 05:30in New Yor City, but it could be anywhere because,before the dramaisfinished,anywhere will become everywhere.  the world will suddenlybecome horrifyingly small. GENERL BLACK (DAN O'HERRLEHIEY) is waking and heading to Washington for a defe nce department meeting at the pentGON.  At the same time ,a USAF squadron of bombers is takingoff from an Alskan base and going on their routine patrolsat or nearmthe bordersof the Soviet Union, as the Russian jets arealso doing,moreor less.  In Washington D.C. a posh dinner party that beganthe previousevening and has been embroiledin a discussion on the survivability of a nuclearwasr is finally winding down.  The center of the attention is a Political Science professor, Dr rotoshcelle, played by WalterMatheau.  He bumpshead s with actor Dana Elcarwho insists that ANY nuclearwar is insanity and unacceptable.  Matheau feels that it is importannt who wins and who looses.  It is alsoclear that Rotoschelehates the Communists with a secret strength we never findout about.  Likely,it ispesonal.  The dinner party breaks up and masttheau heads to the same Pentagon briefingGen.black is goingto and this convenes with the new Secretary of war in attendance, a Mr. simpson.  In Omaha, General bogan, fraank  overton, the sheriff in &#34;To Kill A Mockingbird,&#34;is conducting atour for a Senator and an executive froman electronics firm.  With his aide, Col.Cassio, fritz Weaver, Bogan proudly displays the sophistication and competancey of themyriad of computers and monitors that safegaurd the skies over the United States from enemy attack,particularly of asuprisenature.  The Senator is sceptical that the computers are 100% foolproof and voicesconcerns about a onein a million glich triggering a war.  Bogan is vainly unsympathetic to the senator'sworries buttreatshimwith all due respect.<br /><br />  Colonel Cassio has a faher whi is an out ofcontrolAlchoholic and when notified by phone he is on a binge, Cassio must leavethe base, head to his parents homeand take control of the situation.  General Bogan arrives,and goes toretireve cassio so he won'tmissthe meeting, via live phone confrence all fromWashington.  Finding the Col.with a drunken father is an embarrasingmonent for Cassio, and he shows the stress of the situation.<br /><br />  Once the military and political men are all in ttheir places, the tele-confrence begins.  Therre is adiscussion on the winabliility of a nuclear war and there are sharpdisagreements as to whether or not a war is winable.  As the &#34;experts, military and civilian, carryon their debate, there is aflaash on the largemonitor of the American air defence system and a malfunction of an electricalunit that is replaced by a technician.  this, however,does notstop the malfunction and now the Generals must determine if this a just acomputer snagor a real danger.  As the usaF bombers reach their regular routes in the sky, their &#34;failsafe&#34; boxlights up.  Aftercheckingtheir individual orders they are stunned to realize they Do haveorders to proceed with theirmission.  themission is to drop two nuclear bombson moscow.  They plot their course and begin their mission, as trained to do.  it is a while before the officialsin the war roomat the pentagon realize what is going on, before long, it isclear that somehow the ordersto attck Moscoware,of course a mistake, and now they have to figure out how tostopthem.  The aircrewistrained not to divert from their mission, for ANY reason, and after a few desperateminutes of trying various remidies, the president is notified.<br /><br />  the President,henry Fonda ,projects a calm and confident exterior but he surely understands the extremegravity of the situation.  Through an interrpreter,Larry hagman, the President will personally dealover the hotlinephone to disarmthis terrible situation.
B008133MDK|5.0|Excellent, as usual. Great mix of strong character and on-point editing and pace.<br />Now, there's the wait for Season 3....
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So so so so happy and my family is happy it's on the Kindle. Relief off my phone and I can use Amazon account
B008Y768XO|4.0|I am an animal lover and understand the connection between man and their four legged friends.  Generally that connection is greater than man and other humans.  The loyalty and unconditional love is obvious in Hachi.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|A  worthy sequel to a classic book.  11/22/63, Joyland and now this original, fast paced story.  Mr. King is at the top of his form, and that is very high, indeed!
B008PZZUTS|5.0|We watched this because we love Edward Norton.. thru the twists and turns it will keep you in suspense until the last 10 minutes and then the final twist... absolutely loved it.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|I like the movie. pure visual candy. not the best story but how much story do you need for Robots fight Monsters.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Just gets better and better with every episode and was sooo much better than I thought it would be! Awesome!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Excellent cast and story.  Like any other good drama, you would not want to stop watching.  Kudos to the directors and the writers.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I don't care who you are or what aybody else says. If anyone has given this book 1 star they either needs to get hit across the head or their eyes checked. This book is awsome and should be read by everyone.
B0088WLM9K|5.0|What I really enjoyed about Stargate Universe was and is the fact that it is so different from SG-1. The actors of specific characters, Eli and Dr. Rush especially, fit so well to who they are supposed to be. There are moments where you sit on the edge of your seat, you feel angry about situations going on. The reactions felt real, the writing and acting of that writing is relatable and I can sit and watch numerous episodes at a time.
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I would definitely recommend this book to people you will learn alot and its great to read in spare time
B007SVPZMW|1.0|This game is boring and I deleted it off my device after playing for a few minutes. xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx.
B0034G4P80|3.0|Mfriend ordered & watched this..he enjoyed it..he said the acting was good & some parts very funny worth a see if u like scify...
B00E9P959O|5.0|OK.  I'll keep this \\"fairly\\" short.<br /><br />First off, I did not listen to my original 2002 at all in the past 2 years (and even that was probably my mp3 in the car, not my CD).  So I feel like I received and listened to this remix with a fresh set of ears.<br /><br />I remember in 2002 how I loved this album.  It became my second favorite Rush album despite the muddiness.<br /><br />Now it may be number one.  My two main gripes in 2002 were that the mix was poor and the album was 2 songs too long.  Oddly enough, I think remixing this album makes it not feel as long.  (I believe the album is over an hour which is long even for Rush).<br /><br />I've read reviews about the ride cymbal getting pushed too far back.  That might be true, but I don't feel the cymbal work got shorted.  I mean, I can crank a cymbal mic way up too.  Truthfully, my only minor gripe about the drums (and I'm a drummer) is that the snare in the title track, Vapor Trails, got pushed too far back and sounds a little unbalanced.  That being said, this track, like many tracks on this album, have more layers than any album ever made by the band.  You are simply not going to get the same crisp crack (drums), slap (bass), and sizzle (guitars), that your going to get on an album like Signals.  And, on occasion, the vocals are too far in front (e.g., Nocturne).  But you know what?  I could pick apart Signals too, or any other Rush album for that matter.  So some of this could totally be on purpose.  You don't always know with Rush<br /><br />In general, you have a much better balanced product, and quite perfect in many instances (at least for my tastes).  Guitar transitions and layering have been phenomenally balanced while keeping some dynamics.  It has really brought out this side of Lifeson's talent.  The true grit and fuzz of some bass and guitar work, that which is meant to be inherent and purposeful, actually sounds inherent and purposeful now.  And other songs are very streamlined sonically.  I actually think Ghost Rider sounds way more streamlined like something from Counterparts, and it sounds all the better for it.  Overall, drums sound much more well balanced.  All that is the beauty of this album.<br /><br />So much for fairly short...actually think Ghost Rider sounds way more streamlined like something from Counterparts, and it sounds all the better for it.  Overall, drums sound much more well balanced.  All that is the beauty of this album.<br /><br />So much for fairly short...
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is fun and addictive especially if you are bored and have nothing to do sometimes I get mad and almost throw my kindle across the room because I be only needing one more point but other than that it's way fun!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|An improbable title but such a great story - slightly reminiscent of &#34;Forest Gump&#34; with the way the main character gets tied up in historic events.  Suspend your credibility and enjoy.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Its very helpful and fast. I think it could use some work on more searches otherwise its a good one.
B000FBJHZS|3.0|I enjoyed reading this novel, but the deception was easily guessed.  As a scientist, the premise that the scientists from so many diverse fields were duped was not believable.  Overall, a fun read, but not Dan Brown's best effort.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love it!!! this game is challenging and so fun. very addicting!!! cant wait to teach my daughter to play!! fun. fun.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|there is a popup telling you to rate the game and it comes up increasingly often and gets incredibly obnoxious so now im doing it so it will go away
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Fairly consistent character portrayal and development. Good film editing and action.  Great sets with good scenes and not overdone violence.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I've only had it for a few days and it is working great! I can even go to my library website and &#34;check out&#34; books. Then I tap on my little blue kindle button, it starts syncing and then there is my book! It's great!
B00A2H9X6I|3.0|This version of Carrie is a modern take on the 1976 version, based on Stephen King's first novel. It adds a few new elements and the cast is quite good, but it is another remake that does not need to exist. We all know what is going to happen and it is nearly a copy in structure. Chloe Grace Moretz has the acting ability to almost make me forget that she is too pretty for the role. The prom scene lacked the impact of the original, but overall it was still enjoyable and better than most of the new takes on classic horror films. Worth at least one look.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|Sucks that you can't watch the whole season with prime. Gonna Quite prime before trial expires and stick with netflix.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing. I'm not a gamer, but I was intrigued by all the glowing reviews. They're all right - this game is AMAZING. The graphics are just unbelievable for a phone. Remembering fondly my first flip phone from 2000, who could imagine technology could have come this far?<br /><br />The Room is a puzzle box game - think Hellraiser on steroids. You get a box in the middle of a room, and use subtle clues and deductive reasoning to get it open. It opens parts at a time, then you need to open other parts to open other parts, etc. It's challenging, but not &lt;too> challenging where it gets frustrating.<br /><br />It offers clues if you get stuck, but it's more fun without them. Overall, it takes like 2-3 hours to complete, and is well worth the $2. Can't wait for the sequel!
0307346617|5.0|Got the book faster than i thought in new condition read it and it an awesome read i recommend it and if you have seen the movie with Brad Pitt this is not the book based on the movie this has it's own story so i recommend this especially if your a zombie fan.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|You get to combine music with sounds for your perfect ambiance to meditate, sleep, pray, or just chillax! Very nice. 8-)
B005LAIHSG|1.0|Be aware that I got fooled byt the title of this Movie posting, I thought i would be getting a regular DVD extended edition but i only a RENTAL Version very disapointed I contacted the seller and he asked me to return for the refund but never sent me a return package like other have done w/ there products. Really should change the posting to make sure they include the wording RENTAL now im stuck w/ a RENTAL DVD
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have tried to get Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle for a long time.<br />It seems to be everything I hoped it was.
B0084IG8TM|2.0|Bought this Movie came still wrapped it was new. BUT IT'S ONLY THE ONE DISC DVD. LIke if you were to go to wal-mart and just buy the regular one disc DVD I was hoping to get the 2-Disc DVD + Ultra-Violet Digital Copy like that title say and for this reason i gave it a low rating they need to change there title so futher customer are not fooled.
B004V73FGE|4.0|Good stuff. I really liked this movie. It reminded me of my days watching the original movie back in the day.
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Great (almost classic) version of Peter Pan - after Peter grows up.  Great movie for the family to watch together.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I love this game on FB but this app is nothing but trouble so far. Iam just glad I didn't spend money to buy game. I lost enough by crashes after I tried to finish a level
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book blew my mind! Dark, weird, and strange yet I couldn't put it down. After finishing it I was left wondering various things...?<br />For me, this was a whole different genre but I did enjoy it enough to read Dark Places immediately afterwards. I enjoy how Gillian Flynn writes her stories. Detailed, yet leaves enough out that when everything is tied up at the end you're left shaking your head in amazement at the conclusion. However, I haven't read anything else yet because I needed a little break from the darkness.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Ian Richardson is great. &#34;You might say that.  I could not possibly comment.&#34;<br /><br />if some of the action and some of the characters are cartoonish, they are still a lot of fun.<br /><br />the only exception to the acting excellence is the presentation of a purportedly American newspaper tycoon. the actor is a good actor, however, his appreciation of what an American is or what he sounds like left something to be desired.
B003CJMPIG|5.0|What more can I say? It has without a doubt the best choreography any ninja movie has had in a while. Throw that with a plot that's half decent and series, this movie is a must watch if you like ninjas and don't mind gore.
B00EQF0JJC|5.0|The trailer makes this movie look boring or melodramatic, but the pacing and acting are perfect. Definitely cannot multitask while watching this film, and it's worth every second of your attention.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Saw this in 2013. Loved it! If you like burn notice or 24, watch this. It's funny and serious at the same time
B00EAIMGDW|5.0|The game was a lot of fun to play and the graphics are cute.  With the 3 star rating system you can play levels over until you get the three stars.  Played well on my original kindle fire.
B00EAIMGDW|4.0|Fun game the kids love to play it too. I just wish there were more levels I completed them in 2 or 3 days.
B00ARN0ZF0|4.0|I enjoyed it.  I really enjoyed using Amazon. It was so easy.  Found out I had it on my Roku by accident
B0089XH38M|5.0|I've used this app for almost two years now.  There was a brief time when it stopped updating, so I uninstalled it and reinstalled.  It has worked fine ever since.<br /><br />Even though it is a free app, the customer service is tops.  They answered my email within an hour.<br /><br />I use this product on my notebooks and desktops also with no issues.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|I thought it was a really good send up of a really great series, would recommend it to and fan of Fire Fly,
B00362FO0K|5.0|It's Michael Jackson!!! :o) Very pleased with this purchase since I wasn't able to obtain one locally!!<br />Blu-Ray and DVD Combo Pack!!! :o)
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I couldn't wait for this book to come out and now I'm so disappointed I ever came across it.<br />I came to chapter 15 and was enjoying it but then I just couldn't resist any longer and had to read the end....for my disappointment. Killing her was so unnecessary.<br />So upsetting :/
B0000041XX|5.0|Out of the (3) tenor series, this early version to me is the best.  I have made individual copies for my digital system using a simple noise-reduction software technique to enhance the recordings.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|We absolutely loved it! My son & I couldn't help but sing all day! Definitely a must see movie!!! Enjoy!
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I've used a number of keyboards over the past few years and ultimately began to like a beta version of swype.  I got tired of it expiring so I got SwiftKey when it was the FAOTD.  It has incredible word prediction (if you're entering text traditionally)  and may actually approach the speed of Swype.  In the &quot;flow&quot;  setting (which mimics Swype and the Google keyboard)  it is  TERRIBLE.  My wife uninstalled in a day,  but I stupidly have kept plugging away with it. Not worth 1 cent of you like to flow (get the free version of you don't want to flow). Get the Google keyboard (which I'm going to do as soon as I'm done writing this review,  which has taken forever on this keyboard).
B00ARN0ZF0|3.0|This movie was ok.  It's kind of a let down after all the hype surrounding the film and also after watching the other three films in the series.  Not at all how I thought it would end.
B00F3WO0NS|4.0|When I first started watching THE VAMPIRE DIARIES way back in season 1 I didn't think it'd be a show that I looked forward to each week. Some of the dialogue was cliche, the characters were so angsty and frankly some of them were pretty annoying. But Damon (Ian Somerholder) and the snarky humor he carried around with him kept me coming back for more and after about 6 episodes I was hopelessly hooked.<br /><br />This season is no different. If you can overlook some of the angst and the fact that certain characters should just die already, the plot twists and Damon's great lines will have you hanging on to every episode.
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|One of my fav movies big robot big monsters fighting self sacrifice and more what else do you need it's amazing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so excited when this finally became available.  I love this game and I play it all the time.  thank you for making it available for kindle.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I am absolutely amazed by the graphics and game interface. Awesome on kindle fire. Best action game I have played in years!!
B000001GPX|5.0|I have heard many versions of these great and ubiquitous symphonies, but never the Kleiber one. Until now. I had read great things about this, and all I can say is they're right. This is amazing stuff and I doubt if any better versions of these symphonies exist, anywhere. There's an emotive dynamism here missing in most other renditions. I wish I could have seen Mr Kleiber in action. I also picked up his conducting of Brahms 4th and, again, a better version I have not heard. A pity Maestro Kleiber didn't record more stuff.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Pretty good all around though I find the acorn cost to supply ratio is extreme. The only issue I have is being asked to rate the game every time I log in. Other than that it's great.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this show!!! I cannot get enough! ! I only wish Amazon would get the seasons sooner! Definitely a must see
B000002GA8|5.0|Saw this on television when I was a kid and was amazed. I have had this in my collection since the 70's. Had to replace the cd. This is a great addition to anyone's collection.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Smart, fast paced, full of twists and turns, very fun to watch.  Look forward to more seasons.  Right now it is my favorite daily hangout.  Love it.
B000002GBK|5.0|Classic Rick. If you are a fan and love legends put to music. Take the time to listen to. Just classic.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is fun, easy, and addictive.  I like that people I know on FB can help me progress to next levels
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book was terrible! I was so excited for it to come out and have been waiting months. I read it in a few hours and I hated almost the entire book. The characters that you like, the ones you root for, most get screwed over in some way. The \\"bad guys\\" end up better off than the main characters. I wont ever read this book again and regret reading it in the first place.
B00F7YHDWC|2.0|this game is for someone with nothing better to do.  I cleared it off of the kindle pretty fast.  I gave it a try anyways
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I read the last sentence after buying because I just needed to see how it ended. The ending killed the series for me. I bought the book but will not be reading the entire thing. How can you kill off such an important character?! What a huge let down and disappointment...
B00E7SFAAG|2.0|Why do I even try some of these games.  this was one that I wasted time on.  willing to give some of these a try
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is great,and the best part its free. Hard to believe  how popular this game is,everyone plays. Fun  Fun and Highly addictive!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am So EXCITED! Now I can play on my kindle and delete from phone. No more automatic shutdowns, no more worrying about my battery life on my phone. Eeeek I'm so HAPPY,HAPPY,HAPPY.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is the best app killer out there.  I love that it also cleans your cache and empty folders too.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|I want to like the &#34;hero&#34; in the movie.  I like the character that Russell Crowe plays.  He loves his wife and will do whatever he can to rescue her.  He will break the law and risk his own life.  So I root for him.  I want him to succeed in his plan.  I watched this movie, and then I bought this movie.  I don't often do that, so that tells you how much I like this film.
B00B7FXZQS|1.0|If you could go to the bathroom and crap out a movie, that film would be called Paranormal Activity 4.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|To tell you the truth, I had no idea this movie involved zombies! Yes, I saw the commercials and trailers but, I guess the big &#34;Z&#34; on the cover wasn't enough to ring a bell with me. It's an OK story with a somewhat &#34;leading&#34; ending. If there's not a sequel to this movie someday, then you, as well as I, will forever be disappointed in the way this one wrapped up.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|This movie rules. It made me feel like a kid again.<br /><br />Sit down, unplug your brain, and be prepared to be entertained.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|It really wasn't what I was expecting. Kinda boring actually. That's about it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless you're a die-hard magic enthusiast. Even then, you'd probably be disappointed with it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had heard a lot about Suits but never had the chance to check it out. It is SO good- Law & Order meets ......I'm not sure what. Two young-ish guys working at a law firm as lawyers, but only one is legally a lawyer. This show is a good combination of their personal lives and the characters at the firm and usually one case per episode. Point of reference: Other shows I like = Revenge, L&O SVU, Criminal Minds, Homeland, Shameless, Sex and the City....I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
B005PK553C|5.0|It was awesome! I hope that season two will be on prime soon, I really enjoyed it, please let me know when it will be available
B008Y6OS64|3.0|If you're a drug user or have been a drug user then this movie may hold some appeal for you. If you can say to yourself while watching this movie, &#34;Oh, yeah, I remember what that was like,&#34; (spending your days stealing, and your nights shooting up heroin), then you may like this movie. I couldn't even relate on a fantasy level. Even when I was young and dropping acid back in the 60s, I never went this low. Nor did I ever consider it.<br />If you get passed the toilet scene without hiding your eyes, then that says something about you. I couldn't do it. Sick is sick. And that was sick, very sick.
1439102813|5.0|Interesting to get inside the head of someone progressing/regressing into Alzheimer's disease.  Gives one a little deeper understanding of how the person feels and struggles to maintain balance and also what the caregiver is feeling.<br /><br />I'd recommend to anyone, except for a really young person as I don't think they could relate in most cases.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|It was an okay read. Not one of my favorites a lot of jumping around. I did however, like the endin.
0385743564|5.0|I have read almost every book by Brandon Sanderson and they are they kind that you can't put down. My only complaint is that I have to wait for the next book in the series to come out before I can read it. As soon as you finish this book, you'll want to start on the next one! (which isn't out yet) :'(
B006LSZECO|2.0|Ok had to finish it because that's how I am, but I never enjoyed the book. Terrible ending, depressing and unbelievable at times.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|This was a waste of $4.  I love the first one, liked the second, but this was pure a money-grab.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very frustrating at times but fun to play even if it takes you weeks to get through one game love it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very addictive, but I love passing my time with it when the rest of the family is watching something on TV that I have no interest in.
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Beautiful illustrations and a fascinating story for kids of all ages! The Polar Express is perfect reading for the Christmas season.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book seems was a few original stories I have read over the years. I was truly surprised at the secrets, the plot twists and how seven minutes can really change your life. The author was funny and handled the heaviness of this story like a pro. I would recommend this book & I think you would enjoy it as well.
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|Father and son is good sincere as love father or son plus learn courage and survival.<br />Son's mission is goal to get beacon for call rescue but through many danger in wild woods and adventure.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I'll never look at RV Campers the same. Nice to know what happened to Danny and his mom. Great Stephen King novel.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like how you can program it very easily and there aren't a lot of different buttons to push. The alarm always wakes me up.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Dear Ms. Roth,<br />I no longer trust you. I get it, life doesn't always turn out ok, but are serious right now? I have spent months reading and rereading your works. Hell my husband who hasnt read a book in at least 12 years read your books, and liked it! I wouldn't say the book was badly written, but it was repetitive in the fact that besides Tris and Tobias, everyone else was a bad guy. Then you gained our trust and stabbed us all in the back when we weren't looking. For shame. I know this was the reaction you were looking for, but it overshadows the message of we are not what our genetics or &#34;factions&#34; expect us to be, but what we choose to do or be. You lost that message with some bullets and  a ghost. Sad to say I am dissapointed.
B00683JK9K|3.0|LOVED this game. Then they updated. Started freezing and crashing but still playable. Now?? Another update and it crashes and freezes even more. Now it's completely unplayable. Even removed the ads hoping that would help but nope. PLEASE FIX!!!!!! A waste of money if you buy any puzzles the way it is now. Very frustrating!
B00CY0JY88|2.0|A pity that a good story is destroyed by too many and too detailed sex scenes. Spoils the flow of the story.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|A love story.  An adventure story.  A social and political commentary. The book has it all.  How much longer can the North Korean government keep its people in the dark ages?
1609611543|5.0|I keep picking this book up for more nuggets of wisdom...It has helped us change our eating habits and I am so thankful for it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|the game is good but it gets really hard around level 20 and it makes you wait to play again when you run out of lives
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Ok, so I thought Season 1 was good, ha! it just keeps getting better and better. I was totally born into the wrong generation.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great way to waste some time.  It varies from 30 minutes to a few hours, depending on your skill.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Need I say more I am completely addicted. Cannot wait for season 4 to stream. I'll be watching will you?
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My husband and I read this book and it has given us a new perspective on how to show each other every day that we love each other, still.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very addicting show!!! I ordered the 2nd season and already finished it. Very glad I watched after the season came out so I could watch back to back.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is a good read keeps you very involved in the book would reccommend it to any one who likes to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played this on daughters phone and loved it am so glad it is now on my kindle. Thank you so much.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|This is a fun game that has hello kitty which is great for any girl who likes hellp kitty stuff.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is an awesome game I will do enjoy this game there is always something to keep you busy. I think you should get  this game.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This is a cute disney game but my daughter does not play it for a very long time, would recommend.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|The movie was filled with great English actors. A nice story line. interesting to see at the end that all the extras in the movie were also great singers or musicians.
B008R14YBK|5.0|This cd has great music that is up beat and fun.  My daughter loves to dance and sang along to this cd.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King, however many of his books I find to be descriptive to a fault.  This one seems to strike the right balance.  Also there is the right mix of horror and sci-fi here, I am putting this book right up there with Insomnia as one of my favorite books of King's.
B00EABEHF4|4.0|I bought it thinking in my future trip (honeymoon) to this region, a region where i never have gone and i only know from TV documentaries or by friends who have been there.<br /><br />It's a good starting point to clarify when and where to go... with good and clear information and tips. Haven't read it completly by now. I like it very much especially because they write about the local traditions and how to be a good tourist (and try to blend in)<br /><br />Anyway...  totally recomended if you want to travel and don't know anything from this region. I'm very happy with it.<br /><br />Pablo... from Chile
B002XBVQKW|5.0|One of the movies which our children enjoy with us.  Of course now they are all in their forties.  We wanted to see it in NYC when it was on the stage there, but we could not get in.  The part played by Steve Martin was so funny that I gave a copy of the film to my dentist.  Thought that he had a better sense of humor.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I just wanted to take a moment and say how good this book is. It was another amazingly well written book by Stephen King. It is fast pace and has you staying up all hours to try to find out what happens. I enjoy reading but SK takes it to whole other level. I can't wait to read what he comes out with next !

B00E00RB5I|5.0|As a Earth Wind and Fire collector from way back, this album fits perfectly for old and new music lovers.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Love this book and have started seeing results, small but still results. If you follow what is here than you will blindly walk into success in the areas of your life you want it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am in trouble now.... awesome this game finally here!!!! I have been checking and checking Amazon apps, and I was elated when I found out it was available.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King knows how to craft a novel. I'm not a fan of most of his scarier stories, but this one, with its ties to history and references to &#34;real&#34;, completely captivated me. Even though it was long, because it was so gripping, I never got tired of reading it and was sorry to finish it.
B004N622EY|4.0|Beautifully put together, interesting and engaging characters in an absorbing world with a fantastic concept for a magic system!! Look forward to the sequel!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What can I say about this book? I've waited years, YEARS, for this book to come out and for what? To be disappointed with the entire thing. It was boring for the most part just to make the book longer. I found myself starting to scan just because it dragged so much, especially towards the middle. I wish I had never read this and stuck with the first two books and just imagined what would have happened.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This is an underlying desire of mine to do, so I enjoyed the experience vicariously.  It had some moments that were probably inserted for reader's interest, but overall was another &#34;Eat, Pray,Love&#34; journey.
B002APU580|5.0|I adore this movie and the book, too! Definitely worth reading/watching! It's a subtle romance and will have you begging for more of this heart throbbing adventure!
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|After listening to their cover of Gotye \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\", I looked them up and listened to the rest of their R.E.V.O. album on Spotify.  Loved every song. Next logical thing was to purchase the album!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We love this game. It is great for kids and Adults. We played it on the computer. It's nice to have it on the kindle!! Great to play while waiting at doctors or appointments. My daughter has poor hand eye coordination and this really helps!!!
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. I watch it as often as possible. It really makes her books come to life
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I think dragonvale is awesome so far I am level 28 almost 29 I have over 40,000,000 coins , 40 gems , and over 400,000 treats! I have to update my game in the app store so I can have any seasonal dragons. So I have a utumanm dragon and spring dragon also a Sun dragon . So I would suggest you  should play it .
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My son loves this movie.  I was happy to find it as such a great price. Was packed well and arrived on time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been trying to get this game on my kindle all year and I finally got it for free. As soon as it showed up. I love games like this one they make you think and problem solve while making it fun at the same time
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|LinkedIn is a great site to connect with others in your professional world. I would recommend it to anyone looking at building their professional network and also a great way to advance with your career.
B009SKPVO8|5.0|Around the neck camera straps attached to a heavy DSLR all day give me backache. After trying several camera sling-straps costing anywhere from $70 on down, I have decided that this is the absolutely most perfect sling. One very simple adjustment, smooth sliding movement for camera. Secure screw-on tripod mount fitting. Long enough to wear at my hip. Nice wide shoulder stay-put pad with light padding. And nicely finished and well-made at a reasonable price! Looking for a sling strap for your DSLR? Go no further. Highly recommend. I also like the Joby-brand sling strap as well.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Light hearted and fun. Great character chemistry and entertaining story lines. Much like Boston Legal but more serious. I like it.
0544104404|5.0|This is a must read for teachers, parents, and business owners.  It will change the way you think about the success formula.
B00DJZR4A2|5.0|No problems with purchase.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Too darn bad it had to end. The characters were well developed, the actors capable of bringing them believably to life, and a sci-fi plot better than most blockbusters - and which provided a deep well to fuel them FTL into many seasons into the future. What went wrong? I guess we may never know their Destiny.
B00C5R8364|3.0|The pace starts off slow - setting up the characters and the various governments involved.  The villain is another delusional terrorist from the Middle East trying to entice martyrs by his secret personae, the Preacher.<br />The hero, in this case, the Tracker (the typical over achiever in the marines, CIA and the right language skills) uses his hunter instincts to plot and track the Preacher.<br />Along the way there are supporting black ops agents from our friends from Britain and Israel.  Throw in Some Somali pirates and you got a good exciting read.<br />There is nothing memorable or outstanding about the hero or villain.  Both are standard stereo typical characters for this genre.  But if you like this kind of thriller, you will probably like this book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is about time this is played on Kindle!  Now I can continue my obsession!  Thank you king!  Etc etc
B009JZWO3I|5.0|What a great show! The story lines are current. The characters are interesting and relatable. I don't think Aleisha could have been cast any better.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|best series ever, cant wait to read the other books. very good for kids grades 4-9. if you need ar points,read this
1840225572|3.0|The book is pretty well arranged but the print in order to save space and include all the works is way too small. You will need a magnifying glass to comfortably read this book. It is  nice to carry around though for a complete works. So if your eyes are very good or you don't mind wearing your 1.5x glasses, it is a good collection for Shakespeare lovers.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Totally enjoyed this book!  I had quit reading Grisham for a while- all of his stuff was starting to seem the same-  But not anymore !<br />One of the most enjoyable reads this year !
0374533555|5.0|This is an extraordinary book presenting and explaining a lifetime of research and study on the workings of the mind, I first downloaded the audio book and was mystified by the thorough explanations that were geared for anyone with even the most basic ideas of the mind, reason and the workings of our thought process.. The audio book was wonderful but it did not contain the tests, graphs and visual data that was explained but not shown in the audio book. If you want to know why you make logical mistakes and errors in judgement, this book is enlightening.
B00ECTZKJ6|3.0|I don't get these 5 star reviews. This is the most average meh album I've listened to in years. It seems after the 90s Korn just started sounded like mush. They've been singing about the same \\"endless torment and suffering\\" for years now, while rolling in their millions of dollars and huge mansions. It's like really?<br /><br />I guess if you're a korn fan, judging from the Korn fan reviews below you'll love this album. Maybe I've just out grown this type of music, but I don't think that's it, this album just sucks.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Works great with lastest update. A lots of fun killing time. If you like picture puzzles you will enjoy this one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!!!  i have been playing it on facebook for forever!  So excited that I could finally get it on my Kindle!
B00455IVHU|4.0|I loved this, but it's not for everyone. The story is compelling and funny, but can hurt your heart at times. Barbra doesn't feel cliche' even though she takes on a familiar role. This movie showed respect for each character. So much so that it makes the ludicris plot of a straight man wanting a sexless marriage seem downright believable.
1452126607|3.0|I bought this as a gift for a cat owner/cat lover.  I sure hope she likes it.  I think if I had given it more thought before buying it, I might have selected a cat calendar that had happy faces instead of grumpy ones.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is really cool and I hope they make another one. This is most likely the best book I ever read.
B00FEHXISA|1.0|very boring.  not up to the standards of the previous 2.  lacks a compelling villain.  too much screen time with tony stark and not enough screen time with iron man.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I Love this game it sucks that you have to wait for energy though but it is totally worth downloading it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's been great to play on my kindle. Only thing bad is I don't like how you send request but that's just me and its no big deal. Thanks
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Great app for training your brain makes you think in a fun way a lot of fun and good for thinking
B000IOM1Z0|4.0|I am familiar with most of the music on the disc because most of it appears on my Alan Parson's Project double CD played a milion times already. I practically know it off by heart, so when I bought this disc I was hoping for something of APP that I hadn't heard yet. There are a few items but not enough to justify calling it by a different name to sell a &#34;new&#34; presentation. Anyone who has the double album doesn't need this disc.<br />Neverthless I enjoyed playing it and will move to my car.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|This is a good value for prime members. I love all of these movies, and this one did not disappoint.
B007WEQ3K8|1.0|I was really hoping for a fun type of brain training game and this just wasn't it.  The games that seemed like they could be fun were ruined because they were unbeatable at the rate of speed it played.  There was very little creativity to this.  There's a game that gives you a written name of a color with a different color inside the letters.  One word was fuschia with a color inside of it that could be considered a pinkish purplish just depending on the person &amp; the options that were given to me could've been 3 out of 4.  Another color could be silver or grey.  Since grey is a shade &amp; silver is metallic I don't even see why silver was an option in the game.  I couldn't get the head to move in the maze.  When I finally did it was so jerky &amp; slow I backed out.<br /><br />This game in no way should be anything other than free.  Thankfully I got it as the FAOTD.  It does have a lot of games to play but most I wouldn't consider to even be a game.  It's just NOT fun!  I am deleting this because I know there is absolutely no way I will ever want to play it again.  There's plenty of free mind games that are far more fun!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I just finished the book and it is worse than book 2 (Insurgent). Sure, Veronica Roth gave a thorough explanation about what really happened in the past for the factions to rise.  But it felt very draggy. And a plot device that had me eye rolling was suddenly thrown into the way in an attempt to keep this book interesting and longer.  Where I expected to be mindblown with terrific revelations, I felt I was cheated because Allegiant didn't rise from those tropes of trilogies that lost their firepower during the conclusion phase. Le sigh. I was literally asking myself, \\"Where was the series that I love? Where was the book that made me lose sleep for over a year? Am I reading the correct book? Maybe I bought a fanfiction or something...?\\"<br /><br />I was just glad that with Allegiant, Veronica  gave a thorough explanation about the factions, Chicago and most importantly, Divergence. It is also worth mentioning that the romance here developed in a way that is realistic and swoon worthy but ain't cheesy. And yes,there's also a slight development with Tris and Four's characterization.  However, some of the characters (especially the secondary ones) were neglected and only existed as props.<br /><br />Perhaps, I will also have to credit Veronica's world building. It surely is very believable and downright outstanding considering that she incorporated other cities into the whole story.<br /><br />And I am not so sure whether the ending will work for you or not. As for me, I didn't love or hate it. All I'm sure is that it was necessary to keep things more conceivable given the circumstances of the situation. I would really like to say about it more but I will risk ruining your reading experience.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this one but it didn't hold the same magic as Divergent (book 1). Being the last installment, I actually expected more. I had wanted it to be more explosive than its predecessor.  But alas, life isn't always that easy.  But don't let this review stop you from reading Allegiant. Maybe, I am just the black sheep amongst the throng of fans that waited desperately for its release.p you from reading Allegiant. Maybe, I am just the black sheep amongst the throng of fans that waited desperately for its release.
B005HED1BE|5.0|It kept all that was good from the 60s and replaced what was bad. Every episode has some new surprise waiting.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This has got to be the best book I have ever read!! So exciting and just keeps me interested through the whole book<br /><br /> I loved all of it I would recommend it to everyhody
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, it's addicting, fun and helps time pass when you are board! I love the fact that I was able to get it on my Kindle  fire :)
B003EVWDR0|5.0|I can't seem to get it to download but love this movie and such a great deal and wonderful quality family time!!!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I love this series, lots of nice twists and turns, never a dull moment.  The cast is always on target with lots of new people joining in to keep it from getting stagnant....you will love it....
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Practical advice for writers attempting to write a screenplay on spec (why I bought it). Even better for writing in general (a bonus). Best for overcoming the natural &#34;resistance&#34; in the way of your creativity (a surprise gift).
B002VEEAYA|2.0|Terrible acting and flimsy plot.  We gave it a go since we had just been to Hawaii and thought it'd be fun to see the scenery in a movie.  Otherwise don't bother.
B0009QTS0I|5.0|I have various copies of this album but as a collector i wanted to hear this classic records version and the quality is superb. love it.
B009NY43NY|4.0|A good ending to a great series. I knew it would be Sam! I will miss the series, thanks Sookie!
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Great movie, funny and visually interesting. The HD version here on Amazon is of excellent quality - much better than I was expecting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great drama series filled with drama, laughs, and unexpected action.  I look forward to the 4th Season!!!!
B0089LOG02|5.0|The author keeps the reader interested by intertweaving the stories of one of today's foster children and a child of the Orphan Trains.  One of the best books I have read about the Orphan Trains.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|It's very well done! all the main actors are terrific and the writing and story line are very believable... but I'm not a lawyer, so not sure what I would thik of the plaot if I were...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I downloaded this app for free some time ago b-cuz my husband needs sound to sleep. I wanted to have it when we travel, so I don't use it often b-cuz he now has his own. Last weekend, I attended a retreat with some girlfriends & one of them needed some sound, so I obliged. After the weekend but as a result of same, I ended up using Amazon points to download additional sounds. There are so many varied & wonderful sounds that I like that I may just use them while I'm reading or relaxing & for sure when I'm meditating if I can ever make myself start doing that!! ;)
B00ET0PZDO|4.0|Having tons of fun figuring out the clues. Great game.  But very addicting, after just a few levels can't seem to put my kindle down...
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I need a camera backpack for an upcoming vacation (more like an expedition.) I'll be covering some rough terrain and my usual side hanging bag doesn't hold enough or look convenient for photography on a hike.<br /><br />This bag's main compartment has foam dividers, some of which can be moved (I wish all of them were able to be re-arranged, however.) The compartment WILL hold 2 cameras, but you have to figure out how to stow them; they'll be face down and a long lens will have to come off. For one camera, there is a space at the top of the bag that holds a camera loaded with a long lens. There is enough room for two bodies and three or so lenses, maybe more. Plenty of room in a plastic-lined section for filters, spare caps, and other accessories like cords. Clear plastic zip compartments are good for spare charged batteries for the DSLR and more flash cards, thumb drives, etc.<br /><br />The outside has a full-length compartment on the back, which could hold a tablet, Kindle, or Netbook (not a full laptop.) Compartments on side for film if you use it (one of my cameras uses film) and the straps on the side will hold a lightweight tripod or monopod. I have a full sized light Slik tripod and it fit just fine. A larger tripod won't be easily carried however.<br /><br />The shoulder straps are curved, padded and there is a waist strap. The fabric doesn't feel as if it's the thickest, most durable I've ever seen in a bag, but the padding is decent. I'll report back how this hold up after I take it out in the field.
0913866156|5.0|To be honest I wasn't sure if I would like this deck. The pictures seemed a bit hazy and not very vibrant, but I really wanted to try a large sized deck. Yes, it is large, and I REALLY like that, but I am completely obsessed with the pictures in this deck. They are VERY thought provoking. Yes indeed, highly recommend and love this deck.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl's book WILD took me back to our &#34;week long&#34; hikes in the John Muir wilderness in the early to mid-1990's. Actually 8 to 9 days, so we hiked 72 to 100 miles total at 8,000 to 11,000 feet elevation. I could feel her pain with her boots and the hard ground and the changes in weather and believing the crest of the mountain was just ahead only to find it was still many many steps yet to come. The endless switchbacks, steep steps dripping wet in the morning, the outcroppings of rocks and trusting our boots to keep us from sliding right off the side of the mountain. The sound of our boots as we quietly and reverently trudged across a mountain meadow and lovely mountain lakes where I couldn't tell the edge of the water from the reflection of the mountain above.<br /> I can also understand how she was able to clear her mind and emotions and begin to heal and see her life more clearly. What is it about getting out in pure nature with nothing electrical or even much battery operated that allows our minds to flow more freely? Less mental clutter and the stimulation of our electronic world?<br />This book touched me deeply with her coping with her mother's cancer and her family's reaction to it as well. She made some unwise choices, I'll agree, but she tells her story honestly and without apology and ultimately I had to applaud her and shed some tears for her journey and her growth. But we laughed with her and were charmed by her all along also.<br /> Was this a how-to guide on hiking and survival on the PCT??? Heavens NO!! Don't try this at home. Cheryl must have had her little guardian angel with her all along, as well as the kindness of strangers.<br />All in all, an excellent read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. I have played it on my friends phone, and when I got the kindle fire it was the first game I wanted. It's about time Amazon made it for the kindle fire! Get it really really fun and very addicting.
B003M6TVQI|5.0|I like to fast paced repartee and all the allusions to past films, music and other historical themes.  The characters are varied and sympathetic
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|Did not really feel like a full Neil Gaiman experience. The depth of the story just seemed to pale against his other great works.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great addition to the ongoing soap opera that is Downton Abbey.<br />Love watching episodes back to back on Amazon!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Made fun of Missouri. Well written story that was entertaining and kept me interested. Ending was a bit different. Decent book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Engrossing and hard to put down.  I really enjoyed the way this story was told. It makes me want to buy her other books!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I don't know where the author thinks of these ideas but she is creative and maybe crazy.  It's a book that you don't really want to put down but you also shouldn't read it alone if you are easily scared!
B004EPZ07K|4.0|This movie was cute. Had a good plot, starter story. To bad they haven't expanded. I think it's worth it. IMO
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Adichie's prose is beautiful.  She catches your attention and keeps it from the first page with her fluid and authentic writing.  I highly recommend it.  Will look for her other books.
B00C1LIYWM|4.0|This is a typical damsel in distress love story, with a very slight twist. It was enjoyable, pleasant, time spent.
B006VDNI5Y|5.0|Liked the movie even better than when I watched it years ago. I watched for a history class that I'm taking on the Feminist Movement.
B003UYV08E|4.0|A must have for your superhero collection. Love all the Iron Man movies. The cast is a well oiled machine that makes this movie shine.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Well I have to say that I was under whelmed. This book was well written but it didn't pull me in like the other two did. Frankly the ending was disappointing and on the whole so was the entire book.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Am I in Vegas? The game is fine, but the money grab in your own house? on your own device?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love, love, love this game.  Get nothing done, wait very impatiently for my next lives.  Wow!  I am almost ashamed.<br />But not quite!
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Great product. Great price  better than expected  great fit for my kindle fire to protect it from falls and things
030788743X|5.0|As a guy born in 1980, I'm just old enough to remember so many of the great references in this book, but also young enough to still enjoy the sci-fi and futurism. One of the most enjoyable fiction reads I've had in a few years! I highly recommend it!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game can keep you entertained for hours if you have enough 'lives' to do so. Very time consuming as you lose all track of time while playing it. Some levels are very challenging and other not so much.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|Very good - More explanation of history would have been nice - placement on the map and historical setting even better
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|nice app to use not only as alarm clock, but also to switch your android device into a desk clock with a nice and elegant screen.<br /><br />it would be nice too if some beeps were added between every 1-hour -switch.<br />it could also have different sounds for this , like church bells, or any funny customized sound.<br /><br />thanks
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Interesting book and premise- hope to see it turned into a movie soon! If you are looking for something different give this a try.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Really what can I type here that you don't already know?  This show is fantastic.  Since we don't have the channel GoT comes on, we waited for the DVD and had a hard time turning it off.  Seriously, we watched like 4 episodes in one sitting.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is the age old question that many ask themselves. If you were able to go back in time and change anything, would you? And what do you think would happen to the present if you did? This is a gripping novel by Stephen King that deals with this very concept as Jake Epping finds a portal to 1958 and has to do what he can to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from assassinating President John F. Kennedy. Filled with intrigue and a little detour toward romance, Jake learns that changing the past can have drastic results on the present.  This is an excellent book and I highly recommend it. Enjoy the ride.  :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I'm a 23 year old Guy and I love this series!<br /><br />There is more to these books then people first tell you. This series has a Beautiful love story. I find myself reading it all over again. Can't get enough of it! but man was i surprised when I cried on all the emotional parts.<br /><br />Can't wait for the movie. Hope they pick the right actors to play Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele Cause I fell in love with these Characters.<br /><br />This Trilogy is a must own!<br /><br />E L James is now my favorite author.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I have read all the SEAL books and am fascinated by them. I'm a former enlisted Marine from the early 90s and after a 15 year hiatus went back in the military as an Air Force officer because the Marines don't have nurses. I went to training with three SEALS in 32nd street naval station in 1996. Those guys swam 2 miles at lunch. We became friends. I have a profound respect for SEALS and these books are a very conservative view of how much of an asset and hero these guys are. Thanks to all that have served no matter what branch and to all the SEALS that won't ever have their story told. Semper Fidelis
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Geeat sets and costumes....  Movie puts you in agood Sci-Fi mood!<br />Totally a 70s disco feel...  Love Farah's hair do!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|This is James Bond at its best... bad guy was campy... but otherwise Bond is at his Bondiness.  Good rental
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|All is much fun with this app but I much prefer it without connecting it to Facebook seems to intrusive on the flow of the little game itself which is aggravating. So I am happy with playing it on my Kindle (it plays beautifully) so all is well except on my computer when on Facebook. Thanks
B00FPH6AXE|4.0|A Smith family project and the first lead role for their son, so I am not setting the bar real high.  Overall I enjoyed the movie.  The special effects were very well done.  The story was consistent and well thought out.  The only part I thought was a bit distracting was their choice of accents.  It was interesting to see Will in a more serious role as a hard nosed military commander.  Usually he plays a more light hearted character that breaks things up with some humor every now and again, but this time he stays in character throughout.  It makes for a much more stressful situation between father and son characters that is consistent with the story, even as it contrasts with their real life.  Jaden does well considering his age and experience, but he still needs some polish.  Otherwise a good solid movie.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I look forward to reading this with my kids. I hope they learn to be kinder than necessary. A great lesson for us all.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I think this is possibly the best movie made of the period.  It only shows a brief part of Lincoln's time in office, but it was a pivotal period.  You get a mix of personal and political pressures that obviously weigh heavily on the President, and he juggles them as best he can.  You have some of the graphic effects of the war and how it is tearing his family and the country apart, and you have the politics required to do the right thing and abolish slavery, even if the country wasn't entirely backing the idea, and certainly not all of their elected officials.  The costumes were excellent.  The sets were great.  The actors were incredible.  I find it hard to find a single flaw in the movie.  It is a heavy movie though and should be saved for a time when you are in the mood for such.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Really like the game. Have lots of fun. Interactive as well.<br />It's great meeting new people too. Introduced my Mom also. Toss up as to who likes more between us.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Couldn't stop watching it! Every episode had me on the edge of my seat. Kurt Surter is brilliant and the cast is anazing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway serfers is the best free game in my iPad  it is the best free game in the world and  his cheats of the game
B007FG9LIE|4.0|When you need something to read for fun this is a good one. keeps you thinking all along wandering what's next.
B004PUG7MG|3.0|I keep waiting for Avril to give me some rock. Let Go was fabulous. My World was pretty good. Under My Skin was okay. Avril totally changed her image with The Best Damn Thing... although, lot's of little girls liked it. Goodbye Lullaby is okay, but nothing really inspiring. Hope the next one's much better!
B00EHMG358|4.0|a real page turner another great book by two of my favorite authors. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something to keep you awake, you always want to know what's next.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|The first chapters make the scientific argument for Dr Perlmutter's proposition.  These sections are easy to follow but contain a large volume of information (and this is the simple explanation) and took me a couple of reads to really understand.  The rest of the book contains food ideas and some recipes.  Both my wife and I are convinced but some more recipes and meal plans would make the transition to this change in eating habits.  Once we started to look carefully, it became apparent that finding food that is without grain in some form as well as being ethically produced is surprisingly difficult.  100% changeover will take us a while as we need time to adjust out habits in a way that will be sustainable.
B003B02PEU|5.0|This is one of Grisham's best as he develops characters and weaves do gripping tale that holds you until the end.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I like the story line.  I like the fact that she is a strong woman.  I like the clever back and forth during the trial, which usually results in a win for her.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Probably one of the best acted Batman movies made. Joseph Gordon Levitt was very good as were the rest of the cast. Definitely worth watching.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Don't know what happened, but it doesn't recognize computers through Google account any longer :-( I used it all the time, but alas :-(
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|I watched  this my 3 year old and we both rally enjoyed it.  Something for just about everyone mad I recommend it.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Ransom Riggs is a genius. What a gripping story, and the PHotos - PHantastic.<br />All I want to know is what came first- photos or story?
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|What a waste of $4.99 on Amazon. This movie is lame the scrip is pathetic! Action are average and also the Mandarin is a joke.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|E-Squared is the best book I have read on the law of attraction. Most of the books I have read on this subject leave me feeling confused, with endless examples of how to get the law to work for me. This book is exactly what I have been looking for (attracting?!) it's short and to the point and the experiments are well directed. Pam explains how the law of attraction works so that you don't have to be a quantum physicist to understand it.<br /><br />Thank you Pam for putting the fun and excitement back into the LOA.
1476734941|5.0|The book was helpful and very informative and full of scientific facts to back up why the plan works and is healthy for you, not just for weight loss. It's not just a fad diet.  It's got medical evidence that it's healthier for you.  It's just makes sense to me.  I've tried many different things that were either not realistic, too hard to count calories or points with a busy lifestyle or just stupid, and never got the realistic results that I'm now getting on this plan.  This is a plan that my husband and I can do easily.  Fast two days and eat normally (hopefully healthier) on the other five days.  And, it's not fasting in the way that you can't eat anything.  You can eat 500/600 calories on the fast days.  And, on the days when we can eat normal, we find ourselves choosing more wisely and healthier, mainly because we don't want to counteract the progress we've made on the fast days.  We don't feel deprived.  We don't deny ourselves a cookie or glass of wine every now and then, just not every day.  We've been doing it for 5 weeks now and I've already lost 8 pounds. For me (I'm in my 50's) this is good progress and I'm thrilled.  Not sure how much my husband has lots, but we are both also feeling healthier.  Maybe it's psychological, but whatever ... it's working for us.  I highly recommend others trying this, if not to lose weight, then to just get healthier.  The only thing I need more help with is finding light and easy to make meals for 200-300 calories for our fasting days.  But, the internet is helping with that.  The book does give some recipes and calorie counts for foods, but just more easy recipes would be great.
B00CIVLZ3U|5.0|You can rely on Brandon Sanderson to deliver his usual style on the usual quality. This story is set in a relatively modern urban setting, with sci-fi weapons. I enjoyed it very much, definitely another page turner!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book has no redeeming qualities.  I look for a book where I can learn something.  I abhor the sex focus - real people do not dwell on sex or talk about sexual parts of the body or use profane language.  I hated that God's and Jesus's name was profaned.  Names that I love, cherish and worship.  It was a dark, depressing read.  It is not a wholesome book, not one that left me with any good feelings.  I bought it as I had read a series of books by an author with the first name of Gillian, couldn't remember her last name and thought this might be the same person. I only continued to read it as I had bought it and hoped there would be some redeeming quality in it. There wasn't any.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|AWESOME app!!  I have been waiting to download this app on my kindle since I bought it last year.  I play it every day and love that it connects to Facebook.  5 stars from me!
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Wonderful new side of Miss Sheryl, much like the bluegrass from the Dixie chicks whom I miss so much.  Every song is good.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Super fun show with smart writing and great casting. Locations and lighting are great eye candy. Lots of great characters and storylines
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Nice river scenes. Good story. Kids in the movie do good acting jobs. Pre teens should enjoy it. Thumbs up.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS ADDICTIVE GAME TO THE KINDLE FIRE.  IT'S SO NICE NOT TO HAVE TO PLAY ON MY PHONE ON GO TO MY DESKTOP.  THANKS THANKS THANKS
B005PK56TA|5.0|Super creepy. Season finale was rather rushed but it made for a very scary close. Overall great series but extremely twisted.
B000JPRPAO|4.0|Movie from a decade ago, decent heist movie, good action. lots of big names in the movie. Watch this movie
B00FJTYDKK|3.0|This was entertaining, but it's no where close to ice age or other great animated movies. Not bad, but not great.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm glad kindle finally has it because no all my devices have it and I can keep playing on all my devices
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game to death. Now it's finally on my kindle. Every level I pass makes me wanna keep playing.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I have been wanting to see it for a few years (since it came out) and finally got an afternoon to do so. The story is great, the acting is wonderful, and its the kind of movie that sticks with you for a few days (at least). I'm tempted to watch it again.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is an awesome fantasy book.  Takes you away, and leaves you wanting more.<br />The characters are all wonderfully animated.  This was a real page turner.  I did not once get bored.  This is a feel good happy book for anyone to read.  I DO BELIEVE, IT IS THE VERY BEST BOOK I HAVE READ TO DATE!<br />Thank you......
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Opens  a world of questions and scientific answers are given, better than the X Files which only poses questions. Here we are in the quantum world of events !
0425263924|5.0|Love these characters and the romance and bantering between them.<br /><br />Can't wait for the 4th, possibly 5th, book!  Left me hanging and don't know what to do next!  Hurry and get the next book out......love, love this series!
B007MAETA8|4.0|I enjoy his music and this is no exception. Wonderful to pop John on and listen on a nice long ride.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I played this game on my iPod and it wouldn't connect to my Facebook so I could only go so far. And then I got a kindle fire and waited for it to come be available on the Amazon store. And when it was I got so so so excited! I was able to connect to facebook and I love it so much.
B00ACP3OOM|4.0|Product appears to be fine except that I clearly did not receive a new product as:<br /><br />1) The instructions were missing<br />2) There were random mp3's left on the device<br />3) One of sealing stickers was also missing
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I appreciated Aslan's summary of the history around the time of Jesus. I feel that he understood the impact that the context of history had on individuals who grew up in that area of the world that formed a &#34;land bridge&#34; between Europe and the East. I do think, however, that he had decided on Jesus' zealotry and then made the historical situation fit his preconceived notions.<br /><br />In any era, there are those that rise above historical influences and there are those who fall prey to conditons around them. Certainly there was something about Jesus that influenced his actions. Aslan concludes that history turned Jesus into a Zealot. For those of us that come of of the Christian faith come to a different conclusion. That would included Matthew, Mark, Luke, John (whoever those writers were) and Paul. These individuals, along with others mentioned in the Gospels and Epistles, such as James, Peter, etc. and those nameless hundreds who heard the man and followed him came to and reported a  different conclusion. Those hearers and doers of the Word came to believe that we were to love one another as we love ourselves. This is hardly the message of a Zealot.<br /><br />I do recommend reading &#34;Zealot.&#34; Asian is a dynamic writer. There is much with which I agree, and my understanding of the history of this period was strengthened, and I appreciated his point of view while disagreeing with it.
B004WO57E4|3.0|the quality of this set left much to be desired. I have found several glitches in the product. I will work through them.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|As I should have expected the LCD back is a big battery hog and like most GoPro products it can be a little hit and miss with its functions. It does provide the only easy in field look at your recording or what the camera is seeing that you would otherwise not be able to see without more cumbersome equipment.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Well written.  Provides a clear picture of how the followers split after Jesus' death into two completely separate belief systems.  The result might have been quite different if the Jerusalem group had survived to challenge Paul's vision which was not at all popular with the largest share of new Christians.  The blame of Jews for the death of Jesus also would not have taken root and caused centuries of false blame and hate that lingers, in some areas, to this day
B007MB5OCE|3.0|I'm guessing this book was originally written in Swedish - and maybe it was really funny if read in its original language. But the humour just didn't translate for me and the concept was just too far fetched
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|This is a cross between the odd Thomas series and the maximum ride series. It's a nice escape from reality.
B00CTXBO9M|4.0|I like doodle jump and all but don,t you think it should have a up date.<br />So it has football lab  4th of July and white house bye I will see you later
B003G4W49C|5.0|I give this book 5 stars. It's a great read for both adults and youth. I plan to complete the quartet. I am looking forward to seeing the movie now.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|Johnny Depp stars as the great Willie Wonka, owner and inventor of a famous chocolate factory.  This is a more faithful movie of Roald Dahl's \\"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory\\".  The two movies about Willie Wonka was the 1971 \\"Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" starring Gene Wilder as Willie Wonka.  That movie as well is a classic and worth five stars.  This version though directed by Tim Burton is more faithful to Dahl's novel and vision of Willie Wonka.  Numerous reviews have compared this movie to the 1971 version and that isn't fair for the movies and the actors.  Johnny Depp and Gene Wiler are both great as Willie Wonka, a bit twisted man with his own personal dilemnas.  The acting in this movie is also excellent as weill as the special effects.  Everyone knows the plot for the movies, and if you haven't you need to read the great novel by Roald Dahl.  This is a worthy movie of the novel and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I have loved the entire Bridget Jones series and this book was no exception.  Without giving the who gist away - Mark is gone and honestly I found it a refreshing change.  Yes she's still hung on Mark Darcy but in a different more realistic way.  I, for one, never fancied Mark Darcy and found Colin Firth's portrayal to be weak.  Mark seemed like a wimp to me and Colin Firth furthered that feeling.  So for me this new direction is fantastic.  Totally enjoyed each page.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I read Dying to be me eagerly.  Not just it is well written, the story is interesting too.  I think each NDE gives you the theme that is relevant for you life.  Moorjani's conclusions, though well supported, are surprising and go against existing conventions.  One of these is modesty; Moorjani, instead proclaims the Ego as your contribution to the universe of life.  This book has the potential to make you think a lot and change your view of life and the world.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|Amazing movie! It will change your perspective and approach to situations!!! This movie has unexpected twist but sends a positive message!
B004JMY312|5.0|Love this movie. It's a Halloween classic! Great fun for the whole family - Safe enough to show your young children but fun enough to watch on your own. Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy are great!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I enjoy this show.  The plot twists and makes it enjoyable and keeps my attention.  I want the next season to come out free  : )
B00CFQN12Q|4.0|Can anyone get enough of John McClain. Answer NO! This is a high pace movie, sure story line is so so but it was GOOD.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|From what I was hearing I got the impression that this book was to be some what funny.  I didn't find any laughs.  I thought it was a very plain written book and told a pretty boring story, unless I missed something I would like to know what it was.  I would like to see the movie to see if I missed the meaning of the book.
B0086700CM|5.0|Challenging AND entertaining!  Keeps your reflexes quick and can be quite addictive.  I play every chance I have!  Highly recommended!
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|This is a great game. It reminds me of Star Trek with some funny twists.  Basically you are star ship captain that starts with a barebones ship and crew. You do missions to upgrade your ship and crew.  I am waiting for more updates though. I'd like to see bigger ships, more room options and of course continuation of some of the missions that were started. Another idea is multi ship battles. 5 out of 5 so far.
B00DBOF5Q6|5.0|A fascinating and deeply personal book. Richard is a Tasmanian whose father served in WW2. I loved the antihero status of the main character and that we saw him ,&#34;warts and al&#34;l. If you want an easy read for a Sunday afternoon, look elsewhere. i'll read it again in the next few months, and I suspect will get even more from it than I did first time around.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|The game is fun but would cost a ton to play if you dont want to wait a half hour to play after just a few games.  Its kind of a mindless game to play just for fun.  There are free ones out there you can do this with. I would say if you just want to try it to see what everyone is talking about then that is fine, but the 99 cents and 1.99 to continue play is constant after a while so dont let your kids play unless you want endless charges!!
0743270754|5.0|This is a great book by one of the outstanding authors of our time.  Goodwin Kearns writes extremely well and her work is well researched and footnoted.  It is a must for any history buff.
B006LSZECO|2.0|With out spoiling anything its hard to explain why I didn't like this book so much. There had been a lot of hype around the book, more than I think there should be. It became tedious at points and felt like a made for TV movie. I had little compassion for any of the characters and by the end felt as though they all deserved each other.
0452295548|5.0|Not just for people who have had strokes or other brain injuries. This is for any one with a brain. Makes a very complex subject easy to read and comprehend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|finally gave it a try to see what all the hoopla was about.  glad I did;  its a very well developed game with simplistic yet intriguing graphics.  the music is nice compared to other games; kind of relaxing.  runs very well on my KF.  I do wish this game just gave you infinite lives to play with. I often want to zone out for awhile and keep playing.  no way am I going to purchase lives or bug the crap out of people for them.
0385349831|5.0|Nice work! Quality of book is very good, hard cover, high quality paper. Absolutely loved it! Very good present for those who love work of Paulo Coelho
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|looks super fun to play but it freezes and force closes ..may try to re-install. that about sums it up.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A great read it is!! It spiced up the bedroom. Even my husband read the books. It makes our sex life more interesting
0439023491|5.0|Excellent book I read all of the books in about 2 weeks.  Amazons price was way better then any book store in my city I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.
