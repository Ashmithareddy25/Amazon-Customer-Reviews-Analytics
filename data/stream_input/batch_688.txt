0465043550|4.0|As the growing evidence mounts that the foundation of CAPM, MPT and Black-Scholes' use of the Gaussian model (i.e. Bell Curve) for market fluctuations are false, what is one to do? Mr. Mandelbrot attempts to warn us of these false models, not to specifically take aim at the above authors, or to specifically make us money, but is an attempt to help us not lose it.<br /><br />The 1st part of the book \\"The Old Way\\", the author provides ample background on how the most widely used finance models came about and the genesis of their theories (read as Gaussian). The second part \\"The New Way\\" provides additional background and reasons we should find alternatives, as we don't want to fall into the \\"man with the hammer\\" syndrome. The last section \\"The Way Ahead\\" is highlighted with Chapter XII in describing the ten heresies of finance so you can be aware of them and hopefully avoid them.<br /><br />Whether you believe in fractals, or not, it is at least worth knowing their implications as power-laws, or scaling factors, which do occur very frequently in nature. Some other worthy books on the subject that may be deserving of shelf space are The Black Swan, Ubiquity, and Deep Simplicity.<br /><br />Of note, let us not forget, to quote Mr. Mandelbrot, \\"The origin of Gaussian analysis in astronomy conditioned scientists to assume that, in a messy world, there would always be a few anomalous bits of information, to be later ignored before the data crunching\\". Take for example that during the `80s, 40% of the positive returns from the S&P 500 came during just ten (10) days.
B000O178BY|5.0|I spent an hour last night, 1:15-2:15am, absorbed in Trent Reznor's 'Year Zero'. I hadn't planned on listening to the whole thing at the time, but this album demanded it.<br /><br />As a concept album, it's basically the spiritual successor to David Bowie's 'The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars'. It lays out a similar dystopian vision, using a signature Reznor soundscape. Year Zero's world is one of grinding beats and syncopated rhythms. It's also much more politically charged than most NIN releases. Here, Reznor finally looks outside himself, focusing his pathos at the world of powerful and greedy. (In some ways, it could be an alternate soundtrack to Half-Life 2. But on Year Zero, the invaders aren't from another dimension; They're us.)<br /><br />This album is a culture bomb, set to blow fellow artists' minds. I haven't listened to an album remotely as important as this since Radiohead's 'Okay Computer'. Like Radiohead's masterpiece, this challenges the listener to look deep into the mirror, using someone else's eyes. As excited as I am about this album though, I'm even more excited to see what it inspires in others.<br /><br />(Originally posted on my personal blog, on April 30th.)
B0000TB01Y|5.0|There is not one song on this album that you and your whole family will not enjoy. I highly recomend this album. You should also see the show!!!
0345441184|5.0|It will touch your heart forever.  You will love Morgaine and feel so much sorrow for her  life and her love for Lancelot since a child.  You will cry (which is truly a good indication of how  good a book is sometimes)and reread it many times over  the years.  King Arthur is a sad story and I do hope it was true.  I myself believe it is true
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I've loved LP from their first CD, but every song almost always sounded similar.  Even though I loved all the previous albums, I believe this is musically LP's most complete CD.  All the songs seem to be done w/ either a lot of passion (Hands held High) or just shear enjoyment and having fun (Bleed it Out).  I highly recommend this album to all fans of LP and even if you don't like them from their previous work.  Excellent job boys!

0385340559|5.0|Yet again, Lee Child has wrotten an amazing thriller.  This time somebody is killing off Reacher's elite squad and he's out for revenge and god help anybody who gets in his way.  If you're like me and you have already devoured everything that Lee Child has written, you're in for a treat with  the new one and if you haven't read them before, be prepared for several sleepless nights as you get up to speed with one of the most intriguing and ruthless characters in contemporary fiction.  My only regret is that Lee only writes one book a year but they are well worth waiting for.<br /><br />Michael Rochard

0743455967|5.0|This was a wonderful book and a delight to read.<br /><br />For the most part, this isn't a 'how to' on writing.  More than half of the novel is a memoir, starting with King's childhood and discussing his love of books, comics, and movies. He relates anecdotes from his life such as meeting his wife in a college poetry class and the incidents which provided inspiration for his first novel, explaining how he had once worked as janitor at a high school.  That job had him noticing that there were shower curtains in the girls locker room but not in the boys to which his fellow janitor mused that perhaps young girls were more shy than boys.  When naively asking what the dispensers on the wall were, King was told they were tampons... and anyone even vaguely familiar with his work  is aware of where this is going.<br /><br />He discusses writing primarily by telling the reader how he writes and the stories he has written -- and that's a good thing.  It's both enlightening  and entertaining to read about the process he has gone through and the things he has learned while going through that process.<br /><br />He does discuss mechanics, stating his feelings about grammar and the necessity of excising adverbs. And he recounts advice he received from editors and publishers during the course of his career. There really are resources in the book for the aspiring writer as he goes over the terrain of dialog, description, pacing, the use of symbollism, themes, etc.  Still, where the book shines is in the discussion of his own life and work.<br /><br />Late in the book, King reveals that he had been writing \\"On Writing\\" when he was (infamously) run over and nearly killed.  The last section of the book deals with the accident and his recovery, revealing the way writing played a part in his recovery, and ending the book with an opus to the love of writing.<br /><br />\\"On Writing\\" is relatively short, straight forward, and lacking in pretension.  It's as much autobiography as a book onthe craft of writing. King himself comes across as endearing through his much professed love for his wife and children.<br /><br />This is truly one of the better books that I've read in a while.
B000P2A256|5.0|I was so surprised at how much I loved this album right away.  I have not been a huge fan in the past, but this album has changed that.  My co-worker and I discovered it one night at work, and after that we were hooked.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" is a great song, but the rest of the album does not let you down.  My favorites include \\"If I Ever See Your Face Again\\", \\"Little of Your Time\\", \\"Wake Up Call\\", \\"Can't Stop\\", and \\"Kiwi\\".  Awesome lyrics, terrific beats - definitely a great addition to my library.
0345349571|2.0|You get tired of one name: de Coucy.  The book should have been titled \\"Enguerrand VII, Lord of Coucy.\\"  I slogged through it.  Seems he and his issue were everywhere at once, to quote an old AbFab episode: \\"...beside the rich and famous, behind the rich and famous, under the rich and famous...\\"  When Barbara Tuchman could get off her favorite subject of his lordship, she would get back to the 14th century and was quite entertaining and informative about how you would live your life in that time.  Yes, she used him as her north star to keep the book anchored, but you pretty much got tired of him halfway through the book and wished Edward had cut off his head or the Black Death had got him.  Had the book been advertised as a history of the de Coucy family instead of a history of the 14th century I would have been more forgiving.  She really needs to retitle this book.
1591841666|4.0|Seth is right on with this book and really calls out the things that we've always known about what we should do and why we are not the best at everything we do.  I think it is clear and well written.  I've heard Seth speak before and while he does a great job the book really gets across his ideas in a better presented manner.  Quick reading as well.... done after a single air flight.
B000JJRIN4|5.0|I love this CD it is very up beat! Gwen Stefani is so talented.
1596912855|3.0|I will say right out that I am not a Jane Austen fan, but I love the movies based on her books. So I guess this review is for all the people (maybe there are five more of you out there) who like the fast dialogue of Austen's characters but not the sweeping romantic narratives of the books.<br /><br />From the dedication to Colin Firth to Jane's pianoforte performance of \\"Peter, Peter, Pumpkin Eater,\\" I was laughing to tears. I loved Hale's chapter introductions describing how Jane's relationships failed not only because they couldn't live up to Darcy but because she had horrible taste in men. With a plot that makes fiction into fact and keeps you guessing as to who is flesh and blood and who is just playing a part, this book will keep you reading.<br /><br />Sure, the characters are a little flat, the book is much shorter than any Austen novel and the romance is a little forced, but overall, this is a good read. Don't expect this to be a modern \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" but a story of a woman who is trying to find herself in a life that has always been just a little bit of an act.
B000002C25|3.0|Loud, noisy, cluttered, bold, ambitious, long, disjointed, inconsistent; all are words that describe Be Here Now.  Oasis' third album, released while the band was arguably the most popular group in the world and on top of its game, is a mixed bag of good and bad, of clever and stupid.  Unlike Definitely Maybe and What's The Story (Morning Glory), Be Here Now is not stacked with great songs.  While there are flashes of brilliance, the album, as a collection of songs, is disappointing.  At the risk of being cliche, it's fair to describe Be Here Now as being less than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Most of the time, I do not review albums song-by-song.  But, this case warrants that kind of approach.<br /><br />D'You Know What I Mean? - 5 stars!  It's in-your-face, long, somewhat cluttered, arguably silly lyrically (in a few spots), but it is a top notch rock song.  More than anything, this song made me a huge Oasis fan.<br /><br />My Big Mouth - 3 stars.  There's a nice rock feel with a big guitar sound.  The lyrics certainly describe the Gallagher brothers at that time.<br /><br />Magic Pie - 2.5 stars.  As a big fan of Noel Gallagher as a vocalist, Magic Pie is noteworthy and somewhat enjoyable.  But it might be his worst vocal work on record.  It's as if he's whining and crying to the listener about...nothing.  The little blooper at the end is unnecessary clutter.<br /><br />Stand By Me - 3.5 stars.  Despite it's boring, cliche title, it's a good song.  Liam's vocal work is great and the guitar work is nice.  The acoustic version is better.<br /><br />I Hope, I Think, I Know - 3 stars.  It has a very Oasis feel to it.  It's catchy, has a nice rock pace, big guitars and OK (though hardly inspiring) lyrics.  This song sounded better 10 years ago when Be Here Now was first released.<br /><br />The Girl In The Dirty Shirt - 3 stars.  For some reason, this song is hated.  Knowing that it is about Noel's wife, Meg Matthews, wearing the same shirt for a few days while traveling with the band gives it a little bit more credibility.<br /><br />Fade In-Out - 3 stars.  With Johnny Depp's help - yes, the Johnny Depp - the Gallaghers unintentionally remake \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\" (Bon Jovi.)<br /><br />Don't Go Away - 3 stars.  A power ballad of sorts about Peggy Gallagher's cancer battle, Don't Go Away uses every conceivable cliche.  That it is about an ill mother, and not a girlfriend, rescues it.  It has a nice melody and Liam does a great job vocally.<br /><br />Be Here Now - 2 stars.  Nothing particularly memorable about this one.<br /><br />All Around The World - 4.5 stars.  Perhaps trying to capture the same spirit that long, anthemic tunes like \\"Hey Jude\\" and \\"Bittersweet Symphony,\\" Noel came up with one of the band's most enduring pop pieces.  If you didn't pay much attention to this song - and its Yellow Submarine rip off video - 10 years ago, you've heard the chorus a million times on AT & T commercials.  It's hardly high art, it says nothing of any importance and is too long, but it's catchy, a good sing-a-long song.<br /><br />It's Gettin' Better (Man!!) - 2 stars.  I love big guitar rock but this one just doesn't cut it.  Once again, there's too much going on in the song.  Credit to Noel for, again, having something positive and life-affirming to say.<br /><br />All Around The World (Reprise) - 0 stars.  All Around the World was long enough.  Was this really necessary.  It's filler.  Some better work, which fortunately found their way onto singles, was cut to make room for a reprise.  That is a serious strike against the album as a whole.<br /><br />Be Here Now tends to be either loved or hated.  Personally, I see no reason to hate it, but much of the criticism leveled against the Gallaghers for it is justified.  Though not Oasis' best work, Be Here Now is worthwhile.dibility.

B000PKG6TE|4.0|After a dissapointing effort in \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" Queens of the Stone Age returns after two years and puts out one of the best album of 2007.  The sick twisted lyrics of Josh Homme intoxicate the listener with an eerie sense to get up and mosh.  While most the members are newer to the band they still provide solid backing vocals and the slick guitar moves of Troy Van Leeuwen make me proud.  <br />  <br />1. Turnin' On the Screw- One of the more dissapointing songs on the album.  The guitar is the most solid part of the song with the vocals lacking any substance this song starts off with a promising rift only to be followed by unruley vocals.  As the song progresses you hear more of the same.  While the chorus is very addictive Turnin' On the Screw isn't a solid opener, it should of been put way back into the album and another song replacing because the lead off song is always the difference maker and this song fails to deliver anything new.  2.5/5  <br />  <br />2. Sick,Sick,Sick- The most solid track on the album, the sickening but pleasurable guitar rift to start it off quickly hooks the listener.  Josh Homme's vocals are sincerly dark and dirty but they are addicting like a drug.  The mesmerizing chorus is what brings this song into focus, five words total, Sick,Sick,Sick, Don't Resist.  While charming and gritty this song does have its pitfalls, the guitar work slowly gets weaker as the song progresses but the song itself overly overcomes these pitfalls.  This song truely is \\"Candy to Cum Too.\\" 5/5  <br />  <br />3. I'm Designer- Queens of the Stone Age's most electronic song to date.  It is twisted and full of beats that will keep any QOSTA fan happy.  The lyrics are incredibly well written and very deep and true such as \\"My generation is for sale.\\" Homme's voice isn't as solid as it could be but really no song is perfect. Although the guitar while simple is incredibly smooth and well done.  This is one of the stand out songs on the album.  4/5  <br />  <br />4. Into the Hollow- A slow and yet fast moving sorta love song.  While not as good as it could be I see this as one of the tracks were the drummer Joey Castillo delivers a drumline so simple but oh so trippy.  Homme's voice in this truely shows how adept he is a singer.  The guitar is all mashed up and horrible in this song.  Decent but definitly nothing to write home about. 3/5  <br />  <br />5. Misfit Love- Another electronic song by the Queens of the Stone Age.  Misfit Love truely lack in comparison to I'm Designer.  The vocals are usually light and unappealing.  While Homme's vocal range increases everything else either stays the same or gets worse.  While this song is far from perfect it is definitly not the worst song on the album. The electronic work on Misfit Love is incredible, although this song does remind me a little bit of Nine Inch Nails. 3/5  <br />  <br />6. Battery Acid- The beginning of this song delivers a slow dark start while setting into a pop punkish guitar beat.  Homme's voice echos and truely shines in this song.  While once again the lead off drums and guitar aren't anything impressive they do the song justice and keep with its dark but light pace.  A halway decent song good middle song. 3.5/5  <br />  <br />7. Make it Wit Chu- This song is really the worst song on the album.  The piano and the guitar easily overpowers Homme's vocals making his words hard to understand, while the guitar and piano are nice I feel that this song is a little to light for my favorite hard rock band.  This song is very weak and I suggest skipping it after you've listened to it once. 1.5/5  <br />  <br />8. 3's & 7's- This is were the guitar shines the most and Homme's vocals rock this song to its foundation.  The guitar is loud and proud in this song and it tears it away and Homme's vocals and nice and upbeat and then right at the appropriate time it switches to his signature deep dark vocals.  The electronic mix is incredibly smooth and makes this song a bonafied hit. 5/5  <br />  <br />9. Suture your Future- A truely deep and dark song.  Homme's vocals are loud but deep at the same time.  The simple guitar aides Homme's voice to its fullest potential.  The drums are quick, simple and fit the song perfectly.  I say an above average song but it is still nothing near the best tracks on the album. 3.5/5  <br />  <br />10. River in the Road- This song is just like Suture your Future but it keeps a dark steady pace.  Homme's vocals in this one reminds of Villie Valo the lead singer of HIM.  The guitar and drums once again keep steady and don't pull anything big.  A somewhat dull song but it still managed to keep my intrest(for awhile). 3/5  <br />  <br />11. Run, Pig, Run- A truely impressive end to a truely impressive album.  The guitar work is truely great and Homme's vocals stand out like a red head in a group of emo kids.  Homme's vocals are a little on the weak side but the guitar truely saves him. The drum work needs brutal improvement but overall the tracks on the album really don't contain much solid drum work. The main chorus is truely mesmerizing and terrifying, a good solid track. 4.5/5  <br />  <br />Overview- A solid album that has few weak points, I suggest going out and buying it if you want A Twisted Vision of what is sure to be the future of Alternative Rock.
B000I0RR76|4.0|Even though this movie from 1938 is in a 4 X 3 format rather than wide screen, it is still worth buying.  The colors are very vivid and high definition makes it seem like your are there.
B000OVLBF8|4.0|Unlike the uneven \\"Punisher\\" film and the dismal \\"Fantastic Four\\", Ghost Rider succeeds due to its interesting premise, great casting, great special effects and great villians.     The comic on which the movie is based has gone through alot of changes itself; from a standard superhero-with-a-gimmick story to a Clive Barkerish action/horror graphic novel. Fortunately for the movie audience, the screenwriters chose the latter theme.     This one is well worth your time..
B000GUJF4G|5.0|The plot was good and the acting was also.  Like other HD-DVD movies the picture was great.  Well worth the price to have at home.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is my first time writing a review and I feel compel to do so after watching 2/3 of The Planet Earth DVD collection. It is the most breathtaking amazing documentary I have ever seen. Some of the footage took days, weeks and even months to capture. I completely appreciate what the people had to go through to capture images that most people would never see. From lions hunting an elephant to rare behaviors of the snow leopards. Oh, the crystal formation is the caves leaves me speechless. Lots of interesting facts about earths geography and the creatures that inhabit these terrains. An absolute buy for anyone remotely interested in animals and the world we live in. I constantly watch Discovery Channel and Animal Planet so this collection perfect.
B000MTPAHW|5.0|I watched this in the theater when it came out many years ago.  I had forgotten much of the story but not the car chase...   Glad to have the high def added to my collection.
B00004RFFI|3.0|Being from the west coast I never had a whole lot of interest in the natural phenomena showcased in this film.  Where I live an inch of rain is headline news.  I had absolutely no interest in Twister until I saw it was on late one boring night.  Having nothing better to do, I obliged the television and payed attention.  I found Twister to be what I call a nice bedtime movie.  While it failed to anthropomorphize the tornado the way Backdraft successfully did with fire, the characters were well fleshed out, there was a healthy balance of comedy, drama and (at the time) cutting edge special FX.  I found that as long as the viewer came in with no expectation, Twister would be a fun and easy to watch nappy time movie, perfect for watching on a rainy day, curled up with a blanket.  So to sum everything up, don't expect an epic, emotionally charged extravaganza, but if you are willing to accept a decently woven story with reasonably believable characters, and have a rainy afternoon to kill, check out Twister.  You shouldn't be too disappointed.
B000P0J024|5.0|Almost didn't buy this today, but at the last minute, I thought, \\"Why not?\\". Let me tell you, I'm glad I did. The music is just as fresh and shimmering as it ever was, perhaps even more so with Rhino's remastering of these two CDs. Plus, the fact that they have been out of print for the past several years, with original copies now being highly collectible adds to the appeal.    I used to have the first CD, but at the time, I didn't listen to it much. I mean, I liked it, but it wasn't one I kept going back to. Could be that at the time, I was younger and this music needed more time to grow on me. You would've thought a former Beatle, the ex-leader of ELO, a legendary folk-rocker, a Sun Records icon and a contemporary (even now) artist would've swayed me, but I guess I was under the influence of hair metal (some of it I still like, by the way). But after I sampled a bit of the DVD, I'm like \\"Oh yeah! Sounds better than ever!\\" And the price was right, as well.    However, it's also a bit sad, seeing and hearing Roy Orbison and George Harrison, knowing both are now gone. In fact, Roy passed away just after the release of the first CD, as well as his comeback album. He was on the verge of a career revival. But despite all that, don't let this stop you from enjoying some of the best music these guys have ever done. You can tell these guys were truly enjoying themselves, because it shows in their music as well as in their videos.    So get this now, while you still can. And please, \\"Handle With Care\\".
0671004107|5.0|There are not a lot of books that I read from cover to cover without setting down for a break now and then.  But this is one of them.  I was enthralled with this book from word one and loved every word of it.    If you have seen the movie, yes, there are some differences.  Different good?  Different bad?  I don't know, I think some will like the book better and others the movie.  I thought they were equally fantastic and told best by their medium of communication.    The basic plot remains unchanged.  Earth realizes that man is not alone when messages from Vega start appearing.  Using the \\"language\\" of mathematics it is easy to tell that this is not random noise from the universe (an echo of the big bang maybe?) but a message from an intelligent life form from outer-space.  And within the basic message is another message, instructions on how to build a machine.  What does the machine do?  How do Earthlings respond to the message?  How does religion become effected by the messages and the realization that we are not alone?    There are two wonderful things I really like about this story, both well portrayed in the movie and the book.  The first is the message.  If aliens were to communicate with us, how would they best do it.  I love how easily Carl Sagan figures it out.  We all have a common language no matter which corner of the universe you are from: mathematics.  Everything is mathematics that people after the Renaissance could figure out... all that is required is a bit of technology to pick up the message.  In the book, mathematics plays a bigger role especially at the end of the story when the aliens find a message within pi (you know, 3.1415....).  Carl Sagan shares with us the message, which actually made me laugh.  One because it was rather creative.  But two because it probably isn't too far off of what Douglas Adams would have come up with.  But I think it made the story interesting none-the-less.    The second is how this story is shown from the points of view of many peoples.  How would religion react?  Government?  The skeptics?  The believers?  Many reactions are shown by various groups and I appreciated the depth of characters that are in this book and even shown in the movie.    If you are looking for a good read, pick this up.  It isn't just a good story, it is also told very well by the author.  If you liked the movie then you've most definitely got to give this book a go.  You won't be disappointed.
0316018953|2.0|I'm a big fan of Michael Connelly and have read all his books.  This one was a big disappointment--no new insights into the characters of Harry Bosch or Rachel Walling.  Perhaps this novel would have been better as a teleplay on a network that shows \\"original movies of the week.\\"     Hope the next novel is more \\"electrifying\\"--to quote the blurb on the book jacket--and more in line with the Connelly style I usually enjoy.
B00005O084|3.0|Robert Downey Jr was once one of the most promising lead actors in Hollywood before he descended into a life of drugs and tabloid antics.  This was his crowning acheivement as one of cinema's most beloved and innovative characters, Charlie Chaplin.    He is the best part of this movie, portraying Chaplin as a perfectionist and artist looking to make the new medium of film into more than a passing fad.  His personal life, however, was what really made a name for himself and what really set him apart.  He had a yen for young girls, and in a time when things like this were well hiden and not talked about, he was one of the first who was set apart.  As a celebrity he would naturally be the target of obsessed fans and crazies, as well as be the first to be hauled in for un American activities as many of his peers were in Hollywood at the time of the Red Scare.  It's admirable to see how he grew up dirt poor in England and came to America to make his proverbial dreams come true.  It isn't so admirable to see how he interacts with young women, up until his last wife, Oona Damein, who would stay by his side forever.  The May-December romance was no doubt idealized, but then again they had eight children (the last of which was fathered when he was 74).    The story flow is alright, and it does a good job of showing us what his trials and tribulations were in his lifetime.  But, it's just pretty dull on the whole.
B000OPOAM0|3.0|I own this lenticular edition. The slip cover is very nice, I love it. But my copy only has these special features:  -Trailer  -DVD-Rom Script to Screen.  Is it normal for this edition?
B00000JGHS|2.0|I watched this movie not too long ago after having not seen it in many years.  I found the story to be plausible, but the bad acting and choppy story flow left much to be desired.  From what I understand, this movie was originally set as a drama, but it was turned into comedy for the sake of mass appeal.  If it was a drama it would have made a little more sense.    Demi Moore plays Erin, a single mom who is looking to make ends meet and keep custody of her daughter.  Like a lot of desperate women with no education or skills, she turns to the pole.  She's a likeable gal despite the sleaze and desperation a job and enviornment like this constitutes, and is completely drug free as well.  (Now we're talking fiction!)  Burt Reynolds, in the only true comic relief in this movie, is a senator who's a little off his meds one day when he sees Erin dancing and becomes obsessed with her, providing the one and only plot movement to see what will happen once they see each other again.  And there's some crime or something that they witness in between and there's a twist in it.  Or something.    THis was a vehicle for showing us Demi's buff and tumble body.  I admit, I hope I will look like her at age 40, let alone after one, let alone after THREE children.  And perhaps she wanted to make us a little jealous, but now I have every reason to be jealous since she's married to Ashton Kutcher 15 years her junior.  Still, it's a weak movie.  If you need some eye candy of Demi Moore, you're better off looking for stills on the Internet.
B000O179A4|5.0|I did not have an opportunity to view this movie in the theatres, but I recently watched it at home.  I wanted to see what Jennifer Hudson did to deserve an Oscar.  I was captured from the beginning. Jennifer made me believe that she was Effie. I identified with all of her emotions in the film and found myself crying a few times.  I am really glad to have this movie as part of my video library.     I also believed that Jamie Fox should have been nominated for an Oscar.  He played a very clever role in this film. You don't really see how controlling he over the other characters until near the end, then you are able to see how his character orchestrates the direction of the film from the beginning.     I liked all of the characters in this film and will watch many more times.

B000P5FF46|5.0|It's true, rock fans - Scorpions have created THE rock album of the year and one of the best in their long history. From the opening riff of Hour 1, it's clear that Germany's greatest rock band has come to rock you like only they can. The group has teamed with songwriter/producer par excellence Desmond Child in a calculated effort to update their sound, while retaining all of the classic Scorpions sting. The record has a loose concept forewarning of a future where man will be pitted against intelligent robots of his own making. Granted, it's not a new theme by any stretch, but it's the songs that really matter and the band delivers in spades with several of the heaviest tracks they've ever recorded and some very fine ballads that stand up to anything in their catalog. This record also sees a marked increase in the amazing lead guitar work of Mathias Jabs, one of the great metal players of the last 20 (almost 30!) years. He shreds up a storm on tracks like \\"We Were Born To Fly\\" and the super-heavy \\"We Will Rise Again\\". Singer Klaus Meine has also delivered perhaps his most incredible performance to date. At 59, it's apparent that this vocalist of vocalists is still improving, making his well-documented vocal problems (nodes, total voice loss, two surgeries, therapy, etc.) of the early 80s a distant memory. While Meine can still wail with the best, he also employs the lower register of his range to great effect, as evident on \\"Love Is War\\". Throughout the disc, his harmonies are more spellbindingly gorgeous than ever, provoking chills on \\"The Future Never Dies\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\". The writing chores seem to have been split evenly between the three principals, Rudolf Schenker, Meine and Jabs with help from Child and the versatile Marti Frederiksen (who collaborated with particularly fine results with Jonny Lang on Lang's \\"Long Time Coming\\" disc from 2003). This is Jabs' largest contribution to the writing of a Scorpions record since he replaced the legendaryUli Roth in 1979. If you include the Limited Edition bonus track, \\"Cold\\", Jabs boasts 5 credits to Schenker and Meine's 4 each. The amazing thing is that every track is uniquely a Scorpions song in every way, with just the right balance of classic and modern. No doubt this CD will do well in Europe, where the band is still big, especially in Russia and surrounding countries, where they're the near-equivalent of The Beatles in their prime of popularity in the West. Album closer, \\"Humanity\\" has world-wide smash written all over it and it won't be surprising to see it repeat the global success of \\"Wind of Change\\" in 1990. This is a band who has found their stride yet again with a lyrically and musically mature record packed with all of the hallmarks that have made Scorpions one of the biggest selling rock acts in the world. If you like real guitar-driven rock music with substance and more hooks than a tackle shop, BUY THIS CD!!!
B0000CF30C|4.0|As other reviewers have said this is a classic Aerosmith album and it has not sounded this good in a long time. It has been a while since I listened to Toys on LP and I have to say that this SACD is very analog. I'm not a big analog LP guy but I tend to like the warmer sound especially for these older recordings. I'm not much into the multi channel mix so this review is of the Stereo mix and it is much more detailed than you might expect Aerosmith to be. Better imaging for sure but a little less raw than some might like. The bass and drums are much more defined and clean which I like. Steven Tylers voice is very prominent as usual. Bottom line is that if you like Aerosmith, have an SACD player, and don't alreay have this CD then get this version now!

0099481685|5.0|I had never read Grisham.  I don't like most of the books in the genre he usually frequents.  I picked this up in the library because it seemed so fiendishly clever.  I was right.  Excellent writer, marvelous plot and a lesson to be learned.  You cannot escape your surroundings even though you may dream! HAHAHA.<br /><br />The movie was a poor version of the book.  Alan Alda would have made a much better main character.  It was more Alda-ish by far, and more of a Woody Allen scene than a Tim Allen romp.  Don't judge the book by its movie.
B000OY8NII|5.0|This is a show that doesn't take itself seriously, so neither should you--relax, it's meant to be funny. I realize that humor is subjective, but if you like it wry, dry and quirky, you'll probably like the high-tech/small town of Eureka and its nerdy/genius denisons. I didn't want to miss a single episode. The writing is sharp, the characters engaging, and the odd mix of classic sci-fi tropes are hilarious. The plots are silly and clever at the same time, with the same reaffirming message: Humanity wins over technology--barely!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|This will grow on those who need watering.  Innovative, quirky, dirty, punky, different yet the same as previous albums and heard in a strip club in my town last night.  I can see where some of you are coming from though, Songs for the Deaf took a little adjustment for me as it was a transitional album for this great band.  All prior albums and those to come will be classic regardless of lineup because Homme captains this ship.  For those who don't know they will be opening for the reformed RATM(strange but true).
B000244FDW|4.0|I really enjoy this 1979 production of Pride and Prejudice, finding that it still holds up very well compared to the Colin Firth version of 1995, which I also immensely enjoy; also when compared to the 2005 movie with Keira Knightley, which, again, I also very much enjoy.  They all have good things to offer in their own unique way.  I may as well toss in the 1940 version with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier.  It's definitely old MGM/Hollywood, but, hey, it's cool in its own way, too.   Well, onward with my thoughts on the 1979 BBC version.    First, the production itself is purposely more simplistic and uncluttered in nature.  It's not a technical or artistic triumph by any means.  However, I found myself attracted to the simple nature of it all, perhaps in a strange way reflecting simpler times.  For example, you can hear the room ambience via the simple miking techniques. It sounds like you are right there in the room.  The audio is not produced to make each actor sound up close to you, therefore making it sound more like real life in a real room.  Well, this is just one example.  Overall, the film has the look and feel of a stage play, though it's not on a stage.  I will admit, though, that the photography often looks a bit soft, and there are some exposure problems.  In one scene (can't remember now where it is--somewhere in the second half?), it looks like the sun came out and then went back behind a cloud.  You can see the effect on a building.  Weird.    All technical and artistic considerations aside (some of you may have to try hard to set these things aside), I found myself very much enjoying almost all of the the cast members and story presentation, which, I believe, are the real issues here.  I believe Elizabeth Garvie is wonderful in her role.  However, I would have preferred that David Rintoul's portrayal of Darcy not be so stiff.  If he had been less stiff, his relationship with Elizabeth would appear to be more real.  I'm sure he's a fine actor, soI must assume his portrayal of Darcy is the full intention of the producers of the film.  Though I haven't yet had the chance to read the book, I've heard that Darcy isn't this stiff in the book.     I like Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Bennett (not as shrill as the 1995 version) and all the other sisters, especially Jane.  She's better than the other gal in the l995 version, whose facial features are kind of funny, almost slightly boyish.  The 1979 Jane is much better.  I also like Mr. Bingley in this '79 version, but I don't like Mr. Collins as well as the 1995 version.  He's too much like a buffoon here.  Lady Catherine is excellent here, however.    There are some small details missing as compared to the 1995 version.  Certain scenes in the 1995 version are more fleshed out.  One thing I found likeable in the 1979 version, though, is when we can hear Lizzie's personal thoughts.  That nice touch really makes it sound intimate to the viewer.    Well, we could spend lots of time comparing versions, and comparing all of them to the book.  There are too many details concerning the characters and story presentation to list them here.  Shall we also count the times the actors quote from the book compared to the 1995 version or the movies?  I'm not going there.    I try to enjoy each movie and mini-series on its own merits.  In the end, it doesn't really matter, anyway.  Pick whichever one you like and just appreciate the others.  They all help us appreciate Jane Austen's writing.  The same can be said of the various movie and mini-series versions of Jane Eyre, Sense and Sensibility, Emma, etc.      I hope I've been able to persuade someone out there to check out this 1979 version of Pride and Prejudice and enjoy it.  Every movie and mini-series version of this book brings something to the table, so I hope you enjoy this version, too.

The blazing fast guitar work on \\"Battle Against Time\\" is worth the price of this CD alone, but every other song on this album is also thoroughly enjoyable. This one will have you air guitaring and air drumming until your arms fall off. I'm actually having to type this with a pencil in my mouth, using the eraser to punch the keys on my keyboard.    Pop this CD into your player, crank up the volume and dim the lights, and prepare to be dragged far away to the frozen north.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />The long-running James Bond franchise gets a much-needed  shot in the arm with \\"Casino Royale,\\" a film which gives us, in the person of Daniel Craig, the least foppish, most rough-and-tumble 007 since the early days of Sean Connery.  Here's a Bond who's more at home in jeans and a polo shirt than in a perfectly tailored Giorgio Armani tuxedo (though he isn`t above wearing one, if the situation calls for it).  Gone, too, are many of the high-tech gadgets and preposterous, over-the-top villains that had begun to push the series increasingly into the realm of fantasy and camp and further away from reality.<br /><br />As conceived by writers Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and the seemingly ubiquitous Paul Haggis, Craig's Bond also has a noticeably darker side to his personality.  The authors have gone back to the source here, to Ian Fleming's first novel in the series, \\"Casino Royale.\\"  This has allowed the writers to re-invent Bond almost from scratch as it were, and, indeed, the first scene of the movie - filmed in appropriately old-school black-and-white - shows us Bond literally gunning for his promotion to double O status (an agent can become an 00 only after he's successfully dispatched two victims).  Yet, despite this Bond's seeming indifference to human life, Craig brings a vulnerability and depth of character to the role that nicely counterbalance the dry cynicism, flippant tone and callous womanizing that are still crucial elements of the character`s mystique and makeup.  Yet, even in that latter category, this new Bond deviates from the old one by striking up a genuinely romantic relationship with the beautiful Vesper Lynd, nicely portrayed by Eva Green.<br /><br />The main plot - in which Bond finds himself on the Riviera playing in a high-stakes poker game against a notorious small-arms dealer - is secondary to the tense action scenes, wry humor and moral dilemmas that make \\"Casino Royale\\" a triumph for director Martin Campbell as well.<br /><br />After years of delivering one fine performance after another in a string of less high-profile but often very worthy films, it's gratifying to see Craig finally achieving the acclaim and stardom he so richly deserves with \\"Casino Royale.\\"  With the help of his fellow filmmakers, he has nearly single-handedly resurrected this moribund franchise and reminded us of just how good a Bond picture can actually be.ng one fine performance after another in a string of less high-profile but often very worthy films, it's gratifying to see Craig finally achieving the acclaim and stardom he so richly deserves with \\"Casino Royale.\\"  With the help of his fellow filmmakers, he has nearly single-handedly resurrected this moribund franchise and reminded us of just how good a Bond picture can actually be.
B000M4RG42|1.0|To put it in short, this movie is just terrible. I saw some of Clint Eastwood's other films, which I thought was of high standard. There was no character development in this movie, no depth and it follows a typical recipe, which so many other war movies followed in the past. It leaves no excitement and doesn't stay in one's thoughts afterwards.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|I have always been a fan of Linkin Park, which is strange, because most pop laden rock and roll makes makes my stomach turn sour, but even though not the most talented musicans of the industry, they do what they do well, which is write catchy \\"hip-hop/rockNroll\\" songs which are perfomed like a tightly knit sweater. Of course, they have seemed to get the label of rock and roll for teenie boppers, and even though I am sure their fan base is mostly teens, it still doesnt take away from their ability to deliver some great rock with a nice blend of hip-hop overtones. \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" seems to have some fans confused. I myself, dont think its perfect, but it shows how the band is maturing. They cant be teenagers forever, and know they have moved on to a more mature form of rock, some of it almost moving as far away from the \\"pop\\" sound as they can. There are still some elements of hip hop in their music, but they are starting to stray away from this element, just a bit, and more on to more complex things. I can see why some of their fans might hate this album, as most teens, (if that is the majority of reviews for this band, I am assuming) don't want to hear something different, but the same thing that they heard on the first two albums. I am glad they implicated some change on this album, and it took some guts to, as they seem to be moving in a different musical direction. Incubus did it, and is still sucessful, even though I am sure sales are not what they were for \\"Morning View\\" and \\"Make Yourself\\" but they have moved on to better things, and it seems like they are writing music now, for themselves, and what they want to do, and not for the masses. Linkin Park seems like they are on their way. Glad that they took the step to change, and their fans should give them some credit, and really listen to this album and give it a chance, as even though its not as catchy as if you want to say heavy as the first two, but it better musically, with more intelligent song writing, and they are breaking away from a mold that can become dangerously stale, as other bands that didnt, just didnt make it (Limp Biskit, Good Charlote anyone) ENJOY
0060832819|3.0|This is not the best I have read from Paulo Coelho, but as always I know I'm going to remember some of the profound messages it portrays. I'm still thinking about `Eleven Minutes' some two years on, and `The Alchemist' was apparently life-changing for many of the 27 million who have read it (so far). Of course the writer has his critics but I wonder if some of those are on his wavelength, or even have the capacity or desire to be. In The Zahir, a man with no name wonders why his wife of ten years has left him, and as is the case with most of Coelho's novels, a pilgrimage begins which leads the central character to question his or her purpose in life and the things that truly matter. In this novel the unnamed man is a very successful writer, which I personally found uncomfortable because I was constantly wondering if this tale was partly or even wholly autobiographical; Coelho acknowledges that at least one of the characters is based on a person with the same name and nationality, and the book itself is dedicated to the author's wife Christina - could she be, in fact, the Zahir who becomes something of an obsession in the unnamed writer's life? Personally I found this lingering doubt to be a distraction, particularly because the writer speaks somewhat arrogantly if not egotistically about his career and achievements, and I would hope that this differs from Coelho in real life.<br /><br />Despite the theme of love and its eternal energy that we are indirectly urged to embrace, the central unnamed character gives the impression of a man with somewhat shallow feelings; he has been married three times or more and even in his latest marriage he concedes to occasional acts of infidelity which in my view serve to undermine his credibility as a man worthy of the woman he is married to. He finds new `love' not long after his wife's unexplained disappearance and continues to flirt, or invite sexual encounters, so I for one felt unattached to his emotional dilemma.<br /><br />In spite of that, there was plenty to make me think about some of those intellectual, philosophical and spiritual issues that seem to occur in most of Coelho's work. Some of his observations border on the cynical, for example his compartmentalisations of relationships in high society or simply between a husband and a wife, the observations made have a touch of condescension about them yet maybe they are more accurate than some of us would like to think. Central to this line of thinking is that age-old question : `What is love?' and to an extent the author tries to offer his ideas of what love is and more often his opinions of the hypocrisies and denials many of us live within during our married lives. As in Eleven Minutes he dehumanises love (or at least our popular conception of it) and presents us with a picture of the love that we can find at the end of a spiritual tunnel, a painful one that we seem to have to traverse in order to find it. It's a difficult subject to approach and is bound to attract criticism but the open-minded reader will find it interesting and perhaps worth pursuing. I don't think I read anything categorically new in The Zahir but it was elegantly written and is a worthwhile read for anyone looking not so much for the meaning of life, but the purpose of it, and the things that really matter.there was plenty to make me think about some of those intellectual, philosophical and spiritual issues that seem to occur in most of Coelho's work.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I personally believe that Serenity was a really good movie. But only because I saw the firefly series. I had my gripes about firefly (hated the whole glorified Whore/\\"Companion\\" idea) but I really got into the characters themselves. Serenity takes off where the canceled Firefly ended. But if you are new to the whole world of Firefly/Serenity then it will definately take away about half the enjoyment of the movie. Why? Because Serenity is a \\"Great\\" 'continuation' of the series and a \\"Good\\" stand-alone movie. If you've never seen the Firefly series but watch Serenity, here are a few questions you probably will be asking after:  <br />1. How did Mal and the crew meet each other and how did they end up on Serenity?  <br />2. Who or what is a 'Sheperd' and why did he leave Serenity?  <br />3. When Jayne and Mal were arguing on the ship, what \\"War\\" was he talking about that made Mal and Zoe get so upset?  <br />4. Why did Inara leave Serenity?  <br />These are some of the questions new-comers will probably be asking after seeing Serenity. Now Firefly fans know that these questions are all answered in the series' episodes. If you check, most of the people who gave this movie 1-3 stars have admitted to never actually seeing firefly. But I think the movie felt short and they could have added more onto it to make it more fulfilling, like doing something more with the Mal and Inara relationship (hopefully to stop her from selling her body), or show some new flashback scenes from the war of 'Serenity Valley' to answer question number 3 and further grip fans.    <br />So why the 5 stars? Well...after seeing the Firefly series, I still think this is a pretty good movie. So if you are a firefly fan, definately pick it up. If not...it's still worth a look.   <br />
044661758X|5.0|I feel lucky! Why? Because having discovered Michael Connelly only recently and so far reading just three of his novels, it means that there are sixteen more to go! What a treat, especially if they come close to matching this one. It's the third in the Harry Bosch series and was written in 1994 - but don't for one minute think that it's out of date, that the best stories are the newest ones. This is as good as anything I've read this year, the only book that has matched it is The Lincoln Lawyer, by the same author.<br /><br />It does, however, remind me vaguely of two other novels of times past: Mark Billingham's Scaredy Cat and Mo Hayder's The Treatment. I'll say nothing more other than quote the punchline from the cover of Scaredy Cat - \\"Serial killers normally work alone\\". But The Concrete Blonde is in fact heavily built around a courtroom drama that spreads its full length, because Bosch (or more correctly the LAPD) is being sued by the widow of a man he killed four years earlier, a man he was sure was a multiple murderer known as the Dollmaker. The plaintiff has a hot-shot female lawyer on a big retainer to represent her case for the prosecution in this civil (i.e. not criminal) trial, while Bosch must depend on a less-than-impressive, overweight and sweaty youngster who is paid the same salary whether he wins or loses. As the trial progresses, the reader becomes more and more resigned to an inevitable loss for the defendant, but the conclusion is anything but predictable.<br /><br />Running in parallel to the events in the courtroom, Bosch is investigating a new case that bears worryingly similar hallmarks to the works of the deceased Dollmaker. A new body is found, and as the investigation develops, not only the reader but even Bosch himself start wondering if he shot the right man four years ago. I had at least two suspects in mind and oddly enough Bosch chose these two as well, although I wondered if this was clever reader manipulation on the part of the author. In the end I was caught out, it was someone not even on my `might be' list. I have to admit that I enjoy courtroom theatrics, and even though Bosch didn't really care if he lost, Connelly still manages to make the trial gripping and sometimes moving as well, as unknown secrets about Bosch's life are cold-bloodedly made public. Characterisation is of a very high standard throughout, not least of course that of the tortured soul that is Hieronymus Bosch. Strongly recommended.I was caught out, it was someone not even on my `might be' list.

B000FFJ85I|1.0|By listening to this album alone, one would never image that AFI was once a respecable hXc punk band.  Now AFI is listed with the likes of \\"A Panic at the Disco\\" and \\"My Chemical Romance\\".  Where is the thrashing guitar? What happened to the in your face vocals?  From a man that lists Ian Mackaye as a vocal influence, the garbage vocals on this album could not hold a light to Minor Threat.  Many reviewers on this site call the transformation which AFI has undergone progression, but I think a better suited label would be change.  Change from dominant thrashing guitar and heartfelt vocals (with amazing Nick 13 backup) to watered down screamo anthems.  But I guess bending over backwards pays the bills.

George Harrison, wanting a little help for an extra track for his single This Is Love, got much more than just a B-side in what I consider one of the best pop rock songs of the 80's: Handle With Care.  An idea for an album followed, and these extremely talented singer-songwriters formed a superb collection of tracks which would become Traveling Wilburys Volume 1.   There isn't a single bad song in Volume 1, and it's no wonder it's listed as one of Rolling Stones 100 greatest albums of the 80's.    After Handle With Care, which needs no introduction, we get Bob Dylan's sexually suggestive rocker, Dirty World, followed by the country sounding Rattled, voiced by Jeff Lynne.  On an album full of staggering hits, Rattled may very well be decent elsewhere, but may be my choice for the weakest of this album, if it's even right to call any of these songs weak.  The catchiest track of the album, Last Night is probably the next strongest song, although Roy turns in a stunner with Not Alone Any More right after it.  The album continues with the guys taking vocal and writing turns, and originally ended with End Of The Line.    I know some people may still feel volume 1 is superior, and considering the price of this set, and how much they can probably go out and get the out of print Volume 1 once this collection hits, some may be considering just finding the first Volume cheap.  Well, one very strong argument not to get the original is that you are missing out on the George Harrison song Maxine.  It's vintage George and it's a shock that this never made it on an album.  It's a great never officially released song that every Harrison fan should have.  Like a Ship is decent, but it's Maxine that makes these Bonus Tracks on Vol. 1 so special.    While there are two unofficial Volume 2's (a bootleg containing demos and extended tracks; and Full Moon Fever, Tom Petty's album where George, Roy, and Jeff collaborated) Disc 2 in this collection is the DVD, which features a 25 minute documentary shot in 1988 which covers the formation of the band and their work on some of the album's songs, including Tweeter and the Monkey Man.  It also includes all of the band's 5 videos.  The picture quality is fairly sharp, however I am not convinced they were digitally remastered.  I liked all the videos, with maybe the exception of the Wilbury Twist, which seemed to be the End of the video artistic Line for the band, as it was a little on the dull side.   Handle With Care is easily the best of the videos, just based on Roy's slight head bobbing up and down, when he first comes in to full camera view to start singing his part.  A nice Roy touch to the video, to go with his immense contribution to the song.  The End of the Line, with the band playing while traveling on a train, is probably my next favorite.    Disc 3 is Volume 3, and the second album released by the group.  It is sadly missing the recently departed Roy Orbison.  Some say this lost a little magic for Volume 3, however we get some final great songs from the band.  Their single She's My Baby starts it off, followed by my pick for the best song of the album, the harmony filled Inside Out, which features an almost Beatles like 60's chorus and lyrics, albeit with a touch of Tom's unique voice thrown in to give it an updated twist.      Bob Dylan is featured prominently over the next several tracks, including If You Belonged to Me, which is all his vocals, and my second best pick off this album, Where Were You Last Night, which features George and Bob taking turns with the vocals.  Two 50's sounding rockers are featured with New Blue Moon and 7 Deadly Sins, and there's the humorous country tune Poor House, and the somewhat silly new dance called the Wilbury Twist.  Rounding out my 3 top picks off this album is Tom featuring on the song Cool Dry Place.  It's a more subdued sounding Tom that sounds great.  The bonus tracks on this album are a big treat as well, with George, Bob, and Tom all taking turns singing on Nobody's Child, a poignant song about orphans, and what is probably Jeff's best vocal contribution on either disc, the Del Shannon remake Runaway.  Another reason to pick up this new collection.    This is overall a fine slice of 80's rock history, and a complete showcase all in one place, for a very shortlived but now legendary band.  All their videos, all their songs, plus a few extra bonuses, make this set a no-brainer.  Don't even think about taking the cheap way out and going for the old CD's, as you'll surely be missing out.   One final note, the DVD is NTSC, but also listed as being compatible for Regions 1-6, which I believe is pretty much the same as a Region 0.
B000MNP2K8|4.0|I guess for some die-hard 007 fans, it just isn't Bond if it doesn't have gadgets and gorgeous babes, along with a Dr. Evil-esque adversary.  This Bond is not the same campy, martini-swilling, uber-suave hipster he has been in previous Bond films.  I love this new James Bond.  (This in spite of being disappointed that Pierce Brosnan wouldn't be returning.)    The opening chase sequence was breathtaking.  I was struck with how much more athletic the new Bond is.  Making him more fallable and vulnerable makes his exploits seem that much more impressive.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Product arrived on time and was in very good condition
B000OONTFU|2.0|Ordinarily i would have given this box set 5 stars, but i've taken it down to a 2 because of the questionable quality of the double sided HD DVDs used. The Matrix plays fine, but Matrix Reloaded refuses to start up 80% of the time and Matrix Revolutions has never successfully played through the part of the movie where Jada Pinkett-Smith is trying to pilot the hovership to Zion whilst outrunning the sentinels (it always freezes and distorts). I own about a dozen other titles and these are the only two that give me problems. I should point out that all my other HD-DVDs are single sided.  I am using the Xbox 360 HD-DVD player.
0767812166|5.0|I have a little bias here -- this happens to be one of my all time personal favorite movies, so it's easy for me to wax poetic about it.  Basically, the story of an alien who comes to visit, is shot down, temporarily takes human form, is chased by the government, and has to find his way back to meet the other aliens before he runs out of energy and dies.      Sounds like \\"ET\\", but this one is for the grownups, not the kids.  What makes it work is a beautiful, sweet romance that develops between the alien and a woman who is initially terrified of him (the alien has cloned himself into the form of her deceased husband).  The writing is minimalist, with breathtakingly pithy, powerful dialog.  Karen Allen gives a beautiful performance, and Jeff Bridges gives one of the greatest performances of any actor in any film ever -- he is simply brilliant as the alien exploring human experience.  This movie is bittersweet, full of hope and romance and redemption, and yet tinged with sadness.  Great date movie, great movie period.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Gorebal Warming?  Not even due to Gore's excessive hot air.  Before man walked this earth in numbers there was vegetation where there are now ice caps.  So the world was MUCH warmer than now.  Man didn't cause it.  The source of global temperature change is variation in the sun's output and other factors that are out of this world.    The main thing that \\"traps\\" the sun's heat is water vapor, not carbon dioxide.  Carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere when the earth warms.  It is an effect of warming, NOT THE CAUSE!!!  Please get the facts before you let the government cost you enormous amounts of money on this fraud.  Politics of fear is what they use.  Be independent. Be smart.  Stop the fraud now.  Check out the facts!!! PLEASE.    Also, Gore thinks he deserves to use many times the energy as normal people.  If he believed this, that makes him even more evil for using excessive energy.  And you can't \\"trade\\" credits.  Once energy is used it is gone and its effect stays.  If it weren't used at all, wouldn't it be better?  No, Al you are a phony making a lot of money on this.

0618680004|5.0|I am rating this book because a Christian person rated it without even reading it (stuck mind because of religion). I have not read it neither, but since someone gave a bad rating without reading, I am doing the same to make it even. This is what I think about religion, religion only separate people. And that separation of religons bring chaos, suffering. An example of very religious people: suicide people like suicide bombers killing themselves for their religion, but killing others as well. People are affraid of the unknown like Death, and they want to feel safe so they become religious to be Safe. Praying, sacrificing, going to church, devoting your life reading a Book (that a human being wrote it) doesn't guarantee anything about eternal life or something like that, doing those things only make you a prisioner, a slave who is not free because you are a affraid to disobey; and with Fear there is no Freedom. You become trapped with your little thoughts when there is so much to know about life when you are living it. Once you are trapped for that religion (any religion) is very hard to be open-minded. Be Free
B000PMGS8G|5.0|i would kick scream cry yell and be the worlds biggest jerk if my family didn't turn on hbo every time this movie played in 1983. i love this mivie it is fun and well acted with just the right amount of camp. it isn't star trek or star wars nor is it meant to be. this is fun pure and simple a beautiful updating of the old serials. perfect family film.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|My 6 year old son loved this movie.  We watched it three times in the theater.  He would have watched it several times more, if I had let him.  We've since watched it three times on DVD.    <br />  <br />I'll agree with others, it's not a masterpiece.  But if you read comic books from the 70s, the dialog was cheesy.  The situations were ridiculous.  The characters were over-the-top.  In other words, as a slice of CGI action, it's true to its form and is very entertaining.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|This is my favorite Lynch film ever. Let yourself go and experience this film multiple times and you'll \\"get it\\". There is definitely a story here, but the story exists on many different planes. As for people who say it has no emotional impact, shame on you. There's a ton of emotion here, actually almost too much to mention.    My advice- sit back and absorb. We will never have this much artistic brilliance in the US ever again.
0553804367|4.0|This book is excellent, easily read, and breaks down advanced concepts in a  way that is easily digestible. But it really is the same book as \\"A Brief History of Time\\". If you haven't already read Brief, then get this book, but if you have, then it's a pass.
B000FSME1A|5.0|you now can get both versions at a low price so don't waste your money on other editions...   Apocolypse now is a unique adaptation of conrad's novel 'heart of darkness'.. it features excellent direction and editing along with a cast of some of the greatest movie stars of our time.. It is all in all one of the most unique movie experiences of all time..
B000I5X81K|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing some clips on Amazon and, as a Josh Groban fan,  thought it sounded good.  When I got it, I popped it into my computer and listened while working.  I was thoroughly enjoying it but when it got to Un Giorno Per Noi, I was enthralled! I had to stop what I was doing as I was fully immersed in the joy of the musical experience brought to me by Josh Groban's rendition of the Love Theme from Romeo and Juliet.  This song alone is reason for 5 stars but the rest of the CD also lives up to the excellence we have come to expect from a performer of the caliber of Josh Groban.  I highly recommend this CD!
B000FVBLEI|4.0|I like their screaming, I like their guitars and drums.  The chorus parts can get a little corny sounding at times, but I think a little variety helps give them an edge over all the sound-alikes there are out there.  I love the guy that has the low scream on \\"The Weak Willed\\", its like the grim reaper yelling in your ear!  I just think it sounds crazy.  I love the double bass kick in the first verse of \\"This Calling\\".  There's definitely some good stuff on here, it's worth a listen.  If you want all screaming lyrics go elsewhere.  The singing in some choruses is similar to Hoobastank's album \\"The Reason\\".  The screaming is awesome, I like their vocals and Unearth's.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|This film had great visuals...unfortunately it is the only great thing about this campy, ridiculous, B-movie on an A-movie budget. Nicolas Cage has wanted this forever, a super hero role. Remember he almost played Superman in the '90's, that would have been even more ridiculous than this. He's far too old to be believable in this role. Had they stuck with the guy playing his character at the beginning, the film would have been much better and more believable. Hopefully this film satisfied his fantasy and he will leave super hero roles alone. I, for one, plan on leaving Nicolas Cage movies alone. He just does one rotten flop after another, and he's always the same dorky, boring guy. Why Hollywood keeps paying him big money to star in expensive films that barely make back their money is beyond me.
B000002MX7|5.0|I must have played, and can verify via iTunes, \\"Ain't Nobody\\" at least 50 times since I've gotten this CD. I've missed this song, and it remains my favorite Chaka song. The lead guitar rocks. As a singer, Chaka is first class. Her enunciation and pronunciation is pristine, not the sloppy drivel you hear with today's youngsters. Hear how she sings of \\"sweet surrenDER\\", of love warm and \\"tenDER\\". Thank you! She sings in ENGLISH, like the best singers do. She reminds me so much of Aretha Franklin in this. I refused to listen to Rufus and other groups because of the exploitative lyrics, but this collection is proof one need not dismiss Chaka Khan as too \\"street\\". She has moved beyond Rufus and has matured into a singer of class.<br /><br />I chose to revisit Ms. Khan when I heard she did an album of standards that was well-received. I don't have that one yet, but I'm definitely encouraged to buy it because of the material on this CD. At $8, it was hardly a big risk. Now I'm hoping Vol. 2 has the other song of hers I'm familiar with and love, her duet with Steve Winwood!
1582701709|1.0|The Secret is a phenomenon. Since the book debuted late in 2006 it has sold over four million copies with some thirty other translations now available or underway. It is likely to become one of the best-selling self-help books of all time and is being constantly praised and endorsed by celebrities. Venture into your local bookstore or look around you while waiting at an airport, and you're bound to see people reading it and absorbing it. They will not just be people who consult astrologers and who listen to Tony Robbins tapes, but normal, average people like the ones who live next door to you. There are almost 1400 reviews of the book printed at Amazon with an average rating of 3.5 out of 5. The breakdown of those scores is interesting: fifty-two percent of them are 5-star, thirteen percent are 4-star and twenty-one percent are 1-star (Amazon does not allow a 0 rating). This means that the majority of people, the great majority even, believe in at least some aspects of the book's premise and teaching. They believe in the law of attraction.<br /><br />The Secret began as a DVD. Rhonda Byrne had faced a particularly difficult time in life and came out of it only after she learned The Secret, which is her term for what is commonly known as the law of attraction. In gratitude she created a DVD presentation to share this knowledge and, having seen the remarkable success of this DVD (which has sold in excess of 1.5 million copies), she created a book by the same name. The claims are lofty: \\"There isn't a single thing that you cannot do with this knowledge. It doesn't matter who you are or where you are, The Secret can give you whatever you want.\\" Imagine that: the power to get absolutely anything. Who can resist that claim?<br /><br />The law of attraction, which Byrne says is the most powerful law in the universe, states that people experience the logical manifestations of their predominant thoughts, feelings, and words. This gives people direct control over their lives. A person's thoughts (whether conscious or unconscious) and feelings bring about corresponding positive or negative manifestations. Positive thoughts bring about positive manifestations while negative thoughts bring about negative manifestations. The theory is very simple. Because it is an absolute law, the law of attraction will always respond to your thoughts no matter what they are. Thus your thoughts become things. You are the most powerful power in the universe simply because whatever you think about will come to be. You shape the world that exists around you. You shape your own life and destiny through the power of your mind.<br /><br />The steps to utilizing this law in life are simple and supposedly founded upon the wisdom of Jesus as we read it in Matthew 21:22. \\"Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.\\" The law of attraction demands only this:<br /><br />  1. Know what you want and ask the universe for it.<br /><br />  2. Feel and behave as if the object of your desire is on its way.<br /><br />  3. Be open to receiving it.<br /><br />There are aspects of this law that are clearly attractive to the human heart. We all like to think that we have ultimate control over our lives and that we can have anything we want. We all want to control our destinies and to feel that the universe is at our beck and call--that it is a friendly force working with and not against us. This is, I am convinced, what draws people to the law of attraction.<br /><br />But there are many areas in which The Secret has nothing to offer--in which the law of attraction as the most powerful law in the universe is simply an incomplete, irrational and even depressing answer. Allow me to suggest a few.<br /><br />First, The Secret has no real ability to respond to the problem of human evil--surely the greatest problem anyone can face. Byrne admits that people's first thoughts, when they hear of the law, is to think of times where masses of people lost their lives. According to the law of attraction, these people were necessarily on the same frequency as the event that took their lives. They may not have had thoughts of the event, but somehow their negative thoughts drew them into it. But this simply does not prove a satisfying answer to the world's problems. Does this not mean that the millions of Jews who perished in the Holocaust were ultimately responsible for thinking negative thoughts that summoned this even to them? Does it not force us to believe that the people who died when the Twin Towers collapsed on 9/11 were responsible for calling this negative situation to themselves? Does it not mean that a young girl is ultimately responsible for the years of sexual abuse her father imposed upon her? The Secret offers nothing to these people but the understanding that their suffering is somehow their own fault. When we look at The Secret as the law that can bring you anything you want it has a clear attraction; when we look at it from the perspective of one who has suffered, it is clearly flawed.<br /><br />Second, the law works itself out in ways that are breathtaking for their selfishness. For example, Byrne warns against listening to people speak about their illnesses or problems lest you begin to think negative thoughts and begin to manifest the negative consequences in your own life. She warns against sacrifice, either financial or personal, saying that sacrifice makes you prove your belief in lack rather than in abundance. She tells you to always place yourself first and to always look out for your own interests ahead of anyone else's. She puts you in the place of God, as the one who stands at the center of the universe. The law of attraction continues in logical progression until it arrives at the inevitable end result of ascribing divinity to humanity.<br /><br />  The earth turns on its orbit for You. The oceans ebb and flow for You. The birds sing for You. The sun rises and it sets for You. The stars come out for You. Every beautiful thing you see, every wondrous thing you experience, is all there, for You. Take a look around. None of it can exist, without You. No matter who you thought you were, now you know the Truth of Who You Really Are. You are the master of the Universe. You are the heir to the kingdom. You are the perfection of Life. And now you know The Secret.<br /><br />She goes on: \\"You are God in physical body. You are Spirit in the flesh. You are Eternal Life expressing itself as You. You are a cosmic being. You are all power. You are all wisdom. You are all intelligence. You are perfection. You are magnificence. You are the creator, and you are creating the creation of You on this planet.\\" The law offers no higher power than yourself. This makes me wonder: what would the world look like if everyone followed The Secret and devoted themselves primarily to their own interests, forsaking compassion and sacrifice and other \\"negative\\" elements of life?<br /><br />Third, the law, at least insofar as it is described in this book, makes no allowance for what happens when desires clash. What happens when two people set their thoughts on the same thing? While I understand that the universe offers infinite opportunities, can two people equally have the same thing? What happens when what one person wants is harmful to another person? What if one person's pleasure is another person's pain? If the law of attraction is the highest law in the universe, it must be that there is nothing to govern such cases.<br /><br />Finally, the law also works in ways that defy both common sense and human experience. For example, when considering weight loss Byrne makes the unbelievable claim that food can only make you fat if you think it can make you fat. If you determine that food is unable to make you gain weight, you can eat as much as you want and never gain wait or suffer any ill effects. When considering health she suggests that we can heal ourselves of any affliction simply through the power of our minds. Interestingly, The Secret has been championed by Oprah Winfrey who offers her own life as testimony to the power of the law of attraction. The week after Oprah's endorsement sales of The Secret jumped from 18,000 to 101,000. The week after a second endorsement sales rose to 190,000. Winfrey has since had to soften her enthusiasm as people were following the book's advice to the extent that they were forgoing medical treatment, believing in the power of their thoughts to heal themselves. Doctors were unimpressed, as were the diseases and disorders which did not respond to the mind's attempts to destroy them. Byrne even says that the law of attraction can grant immortality. Yet the people who teach this law seem to be aging at the same rate as the rest of us.<br /><br />As I read The Secret it occurred to me that if the Bible were a product of human minds it would undoubtedly resemble something like this: a celebration of humanity, a portrayal of humans as divine, and probably the most idolatrous thing I've ever read. Within the Bible, in the first chapter of the book of Romans, God addresses this desperate desire to rid ourselves of God's claim to our lives. \\"Claiming to be wise, they became fools, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things. Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts...because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.\\" And amen. The Secret claims to be able to give us everything we could ever want. Yet it can't even address the fundamental problems of human nature. It represents only the latest in a long line of attempts to revoke God that has continued since the first man turned his back on His Creator. There's nothing new here but the fancy, twenty-first century packaging.Every beautiful thing you see, every wondrous thing you experience, is all there, for You. Take a look around.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|There are a lot of shows I like, but I don't bother buying the dvd because I know I won't get much play out of it. Who wants to spend money just so the dvd can end up gathering dust on a shelf? However Firefly, quite simply, never gets old. No matter how many times I watch it, or introduce it to friends, I still manage to find something new to love or laugh at. It's the cast (this show started my love affair with Nathan Fillion), the writing, the special effects-- the whole package is pitch perfect. It may be as close to perfection as anything I've seen on Fox and I'm still baffled as to why Fox cancelled it, but more so why no other channel snatched it up.  Regardless, if you liked the show or the movie, this dvd set is a great buy. You'll definitely get your money's worth and you'll find yourself reaching for it again and again.

0790731452|4.0|A refreshing and quite funny film.  I saw this film years ago on TV (or on the cinema)and have since tried to obtain a DVD of this classic film. Fortunately amazon has it. It's quite \\"different\\" (quirky), but quite entertaining. You won't be dissappointed.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|This film exceeded many viewers' expectations, particularly Ed Harris's portrayal of the Mad Maestro, Ludwig von Beethoven. Knowing full well that Harris is more than likely one of the most talented actors working in main stream Hollywood today, when discovering he was playing in a period piece, and taking on the role of Beethoven, well, it just didn't seem to feel right...we see Harris playing current heroes and villains with his believability and unique flair, not a historical character whose been played before by a few excellent actors, such as, Gary Oldman in [[ASIN:B00000K3TN Immortal Beloved]] (1990) and others. \\"Ed Harris in a wig! Oh c'mon.\\" What an extraordinary surprise to sit back and actually suspend all disbelief and enjoy Harris's Beethoven - pure genius. All said and done, however, the true \\"star\\" of the film is Beethoven's masterpiece \\"Ode to Joy\\" his 9th and final symphony.<br /><br />To be really honest here, the reason I came to see the film was to experience the music in booming surround sound in the dark of the movie theatre. If the performances became too unbearable, I thought, closing one's eyes and submerging in the music would be the perfect escape. This was certainly not needed as all the performances, including Diane Kruger's performance as the Maestro's \\"copyist\\" but more so, as the story unfolds becomes more his \\"muse\\", his inspiration to forge on to new territory in his music. Kruger as the beautiful Anna Holtz, rose brilliantly to the occasion when forced to help the maestro conduct the debut of his 9th symphony...this scene was moving in many respects. To hear this familiar music along with the images of Holtz and Beethoven conducting was almost too much to bear as my friend and I, without hesitation, certainly expressed the emotions the 9th symphony evokes...for this wonderful scene alone, the movie was worth three times the price of admission.<br /><br />Joe Anderson as Beethoven's \\"nephew\\", Karl von Beethoven, was a superb performance as the young lad convincingly played the \\"victim\\" of his uncles `unconditional love' stealing money from the composer to feed his gambling habit. Those eyes were expressive in the deepest sense, a talent any budding film actor would die for because as some actors have stated, to have that specific `gift', that is, the camera capturing the nuances of profound emotion makes a true film actor. Anderson showed the audience that gift during the 9th symphony performance scene and one other that should be left unsaid for those who have not viewed the film.<br /><br />If you have been `put off' from this film by some who call it `commercial', `vulgar', `a disservice', `too Hollywood', `boring' or otherwise, slide the DVD into the slot, turn out the lights and turn the sound up, way up...you'll not be disappointed.<br /><br />Five stars without hesitation...g lad convincingly played the \\"victim\\" of his uncles `unconditional love' stealing money from the composer to feed his gambling habit.

B00005K3NR|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. If you've never seen it how lucky you are to still have it ahead of you! If you haven't seen it for years, and remember it as just a dumb teen horror movie, you have the pleasure of discovering how well made and acted it is.<br /><br />I was one of those who just thought this was a dumb teen horror movie, and was thus surprised when it was the first film we studied in one of my college film courses. Learning how deftly layered and brilliantly directed this movie is was in large part my first awakening to how interesting and well-done horror and other dismissed genres can be.<br /><br />Although this film was considered horror when it came out, now, more than 20 years later, I think you have to look at it as more of a macabre tragic drama, because certainly no one will be scared by it. Many on the IMDb complain that \\"nothing happens\\" in the first hour, which I blame on its continuing place in the \\"horror\\" genre. Unfortunately, those people are missing all of the character development and thematic content that makes the ending so moving to those who have followed it.<br /><br />The film is unflinching in its portrayal of female jealousy and sublimated sexual rage. The appearance of Carrie's powers coincides with her first period, i.e. the onset of sexual maturity. The following events are all about sexual attraction and jealousy, following Carrie's emergence as a woman, the dynamics of the other girls at school and their sexual/romantic intrigues, and the White family's bizarre sexual mores. The drama with the girls at school is all about dates and sex and going to the prom. Carrie's sympathetic gym teacher tries to get her to wear makeup and pay more attention to her hair. Meanwhile, Carrie's mother equates her menstruation with acceptance of sin, and later refers to her breasts as \\"dirty pillows.\\" Once you start to look at it this way, you'll be surprised at the number of incidents and bits of dialogue that relate to this theme, and how carefully focused the entire screenplay is.<br /><br />Sissy Spacek's performance really is multi-layered and heartbreaking, and gets better the more you get into the film. The early scenes at the prom, when you see her trying her best to get out of her shell, and how scared she is of being hurt, are all the more tragic knowing what is going to happen to her a few minutes later. When she is announced as Prom Queen, you see from the look on her face that she has finally come to believe that she has been accepted and liked. That the image of her walking silently through the burning school still remains so iconic and startlingly creepy is testament to her performance and this film's power.<br /><br />The other amazing thing is DePalma's direction. The sequence beginning with the announcement of Carrie as Prom Queen is a masterpiece of building tension -- notice the music and editing as the sequence gathers speed, culminating with the spilling of the blood. You will also notice that this entire sequence is dialogue-free. It is so tight, audacious and over-the-top that you have to admire it. I know DePalma later expressed regret over the split screen effect, but I remember how effective it was when I first saw the film -- it left me feeling like so much is happening at once that you couldn't possibly take it all in. It's really overwhelming and distancing at the same time -- as opposed to most horror films that try to bring viewers INTO the terror.<br /><br />The mere fact that this movie is still around almost 25 years later is a testament to its brilliance. It is much more respected now than when it first came out-- in part I think because the \\"horror\\" label worked against it. Look at the horror aspects the way they should be -- as a metaphor-- and you'll start to get into it. The closer you look the better it becomes.this theme, and how carefully focused the entire screenplay is.  <br />  <br />Sissy Spacek's performance really is multi-layered and heartbreaking, and gets better the more you get into the film.

B0002KVUKM|3.0|A great idea... that has a little too many monsters to track. The movie is filled with lots of characters, maybe too many. But Hugh Jackman and Kate Beckinsale make a good team! The fight seen at the end is a dizzying visual feast! I liked it, but others got a headache! A good movie, definetly worth a viewing! Recommend renting first to ensure it is to your taste before you buy.
B000PFUAO6|1.0|I had high hopes that on this album Dream Theater would return to the amazing band that brought us the I&W through SFAM albums but I believe this has got to be their worst offering to date.  Maybe I am just an old school DT apologist and can't accept the fact that those days are over but I find it hard to figure out how DT fans enjoy this effort over their early work.  For one it is a lot of the same recycled riffing, soloing, over dramatic keyboards, chanting, and various other musical stylings that they have used since TOT.  If DT thinks they are progressive or intersting anymore I certainly have to disagree.  Just because they can throw extended instrumental sections with lighting fast guitar and keyboard solos at different time sigs does not make them progressive.  It makes them boring.  Enough already with John P and Jordan dueling each other on their respective instruments...PLEASE STOP!!!  I can't take it anymore.  In know this is cliche to say but damn do I miss Kevin Moore.  Never has one keyboard player meant so much to a metal band by what he didn't play. DT is now a train out of control.    So here is my advice...1) go back and study your own catalog of music such as Metropolis, Take the Time, Voices, Scarred, New Millenium, Lines in the Sand, Trial of Tears, Overture 1928/Strange Deja Vu, Blind Faith and above all A Change Of Seasons and find out what you did to write those songs because they are what Dream Theater used to be about...great song structure, lyrics, melodies, solos.  2) Put restrictor plates on Jordan's keyboards and John's guitar.  Everytime they feel like dueling it out the restrictor will kick in and make them think it out and slow it down a bit rather than running through scale excercises at 240 bpm.  3) Mix in a major key once in a while.  4) Keep Mike P from ever singing or chanting or what ever it is he does on albums these days.  There was a time when James layered vocals and it sounded great; go back to that.  5) Stop with the circus music. 6) Stop copying other bands...be DT. and lastly 7) Do not produce your own albums so that you abide by 1 thru 6 above.    So, if it seems like I am being harsh it is only because I love DT but do not like their music much anymore.  I find myself really only listening to pre TOT albums because I find the latter tough to enjoy except for certain moments.  I could even respect TOT if they had changed gears after that but since then their songs have either been a TOT rehash or a very weak attempt at a more pop rock sound (I Walk Beside You.)  It is just not my cup of tea and by a lot of the other negative reviews since TOT a lot of other people seem to feel the same way.  But of course because I love DT I will continue to come back to them with every new release hoping that one day they too will return the love to me.
B00005JNJV|4.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" or more likely, \\"Begins Anew\\".  We already know Bats's origins - driven to become a costume vigilante to save Gotham City but also avenge the years-past murders of his parents, Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.  Glanced briefly in the 1989 movie, this film actually shows the murders, then follows Wayne across the world in self-imposed exile.  Rescued from a horrid Asian prison by the mysterious Ducard (Liam Neeson), Wayne finds himself recruited into Ras-Al-Ghul's League of Shadows, a small vigilante army.  In the frost of some unnamed eastern wilderness, Wayne learns the ways of the warrior while confronting personal demons harbored since his parents' murder.  Successfully earning his way into The Brotherhood, Wayne learns of its merciless approach to criminal justice and its plans to restore order to Gotham City, and betrays it.  (The Brotherhood proves to have a longer memory and reach than Wayne had anticipated, using mass destruction to stave off chaos throughout history - they sacked Rome, brought diseased rats to medieval Europe and burned London to the ground.)  Escaping the Brotherhood, Wayne returns to crime-ridden Gotham, beginning an anti-crime campaign that puts him at odds with both criminals and cops.  Meanwhile, Jim Gordon, Gotham's last-good-cop pursues his own investigation.  While the city is apparently ruled by crimeboss Carmine Falcome, the script hints at an even darker power lingering in the shadows, ready to strike.    This was a pretty good film, though at times it took itself a tad too serious, hoping to escape the self-conscious dark camp of the older movies with their storybook and cartoonish settings.  At times the movie seems unsure of how it wants to look, alternating between conventional looking settings and some mix of Bladerunner and Steampunk.  It is perhaps a bit too dark for its own good, and the action was often hard to follow.  Though showing Batman from his origins, the script begins with Bruce Wayne already having the motives of Batman to take on crime - just looking for the gadgets and Kevlar to facilitate his caped crusade.  We never find the source of Bruce's heroism, though we're supposed to assume it just runs in the family.  The story isn't that well defined either, as if they decided that all they needed was to toss Batman into a city of crime, come up with some plot to destroy the city and the rest would write itself.  Of the characters, Alfred and Lucious (Morgan Freeman) are the only fun ones.  Cillian Murphy is the forgettable Scarecrow, a psychiatrist who rules by fear.  Tom Wilkinson is actually well cast and plays Falcone like some 40's era crimeboss, but the story gets rid of him quickly.  The best role here is actually Neeson's - he's much more interesting as a morally-questionable killer.  In short, it doesn't match the '89 Batman, but easily beats everything that followed it.

B000K15VSA|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. The first version I have ever seen is the director's cut ( which is more of a director's amendment) and I loved it. Then a few years ago I saw the theatrical release of BR and I thought it better (mostly) and I was always disappointed that a DVD version of the theatrical release hadn't ever materialise. But now this anniversary edition coming soon (hopefully) I can finally get every known version of the movie (maybe): The theatrical release; the work print; the director's \\"amendment\\" and now an actual director's cut- Riddley Scott's actual vision to what BR should have been.  But these are all rumours and speculations. I just want to is when is the going to be released! I'm thinking November 19 or something like that.
B0007Q6PBK|3.0|Puccini's famous Opera receives a spirited performance in this landmark production from the Met.<br /><br />The sound and video quality are limited but it's amazing they are as good as they are given this was filmed live for television in 1977.<br /><br />Has there ever been a better Rodolfo than Pavarotti? He produces effortless tone and diction and, still in his prime, he fits the role of a struggling young writer perfectly.<br /><br />Scotto is a bit old to be a Mimi but quite good.<br /><br />Maralin Miska steals the show as Musetta.<br /><br />(****) for the performance and (**) for the muffled sound and murky picture.
0783225547|3.0|An interesting story with its moments. The build up to the eruption was great! All the little momments like the too hot hot springs! Though once the lava starts to roll, the script gets a bit unrealistic. I guess it builds suspense. All in all, a good volcano flick.
B000050X31|2.0|This is a barely adequate production of the great Mozart Opera.<br /><br />The spare stage settings create little of the \\"Singspiel\\" magic that this opera requires.<br /><br />Franciso Araiza is uninspiring as Tamino but other members of the cast are generally good - Kathleen Battle is appropriately girlish as Pamina, Kurt Moll provides some gravitas as Sarastro, and Manfred Hemm provides some energy and humour as Papageno.<br /><br />This production never springs to life and after a while one just sits there feeling bored.<br /><br />Sound and picture quality are OK.
B00023B1LC|5.0|Hip, clever, well written/acted/filmed/directed! A visual feast from start to finish! Matt Damon is Jason Bourne! A must own for all action fans! A truely awesome movie!
B000094HMU|5.0|It's hard to imagine a better production of this great Puccini opera.<br /><br />The Zefferilli stage production and set designs are excellent.<br />Domingo is in ringing voice as Calaf and his supporting cast including Eva Marton as the Princess and Leona Mitchell as the slave girl Liu are all very good.<br /><br />James Levine and the Met Orchestra are in superb form - drawing all the drama and exoticism out of this dynamic score.<br /><br />Sound and picture quality are all very good - especially given this is a filmed stage production.<br /><br />Lovers of this opera will not be disappointed and it may even make a few converts to Puccini who dislike the \\"morbidezza\\" of his other operas.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I received my copy of Jane Eyre on DVD and both of the DVD disc's are scratched. I sent a email to Amazon uk to inform them that the order was received with the DVD's scratched. But I was happy to keep the item as the disc's played fine in the DVD player and I could get them repaired at my local video store for the same amount of money to sent it back in postage.   Amazon has offered to replace the item anyway. Amazon uk customer service is truly amazing and I will return to shop here often.  BBC has done a wonderful production. However I would like to warn customers that this JE version is not a family friendly production. Toby and Ruth were cast correctly for the roles. They truly put 100% into their roles and it shows along with an amazing support cast. Enjoyed JE very much, although it would have been even better if the scene of Bertha and a man having sex was not in the movie. It is a short scene but in my view not needed.  Giving this 5 stars for the wonderful service I received from Amazon.  NOTE: For Australian Customers the UK Amazon site DVD is region code for regions 2 and 4. It will play on Australian DVD Players as this version of Jane Eyre is not avaliable in Australia yet and it has bonus material.
0553573403|5.0|How do I describe A Game of Thrones? Simply put, it is a journey - and a remarkable one at that. This is my first adventure into high fantasy aside from Tolkien, whom I consider to be almost a genre of his own. I was so very pleasantly surprised with Martin's writing and story telling ability.<br /><br />To be honest, I wasn't sure I was going to like this book at first and it almost became a \\"did not finish\\" about 200 pages into it. But when it picks up, it really picks up. I can see how this is almost expected with the beginning of a high fantasy tale. There's so much to set up! A Game of Thrones is the story of exactly what the title is. It is the story of numerous families playing \\"a game\\" or battling for the throne. But the story is so much more than just that. Martin's strong point is his character development.<br /><br />The chapters are each titled after a character in the book and center around that character while drawing in other characters and connecting story lines. Martin tackles epic scenes, beautiful landscapes, fierce battles, politics and relationships all with a mastery of storytelling. The further I got into the book, the more I attached myself to the individual characters. Where at the beginning I was invested in two or three character, I was invested in nearly all of them by the end of the book. My favorite of his characters may be Jon, the bastard child of Lord Eddard Stark and Daenerys, the wife of Khal Drogo. Quite remarkable characters and a beautiful story.<br /><br />So much more than just a fantasy tale. What we get here is true human drama and everything involved with it - death, pain, happiness, sorrow, betrayal, love, lust, jealousy and all of those other emotions. I will definitely be picking up book number two in the series, A Clash of Kings.

B000000OMB|5.0|Review no. 97. This self-titled effort was, of course Asia's classic debut album, hitting the streets in 1982. So nice to hear it on CD reissue. Asia was never one of my favorite bands from the '80's but I could never resist putting on this record {or disc} and listening to it all the way through. I mean, EVEN if you don't personally care for progressive album rock, no one can argue that this work showed just what four already-accomplished musicians were fully capable of. So many great INSTANT recognizable tracks to thoroughly take in here, there's no need to list them all. Would love to catch their reunion tour at some point. If I remember correctly, Asia appealed to most fans of bands like Marillion, Jethro Tull, Utopia, Moody Blues, Alan Parsons, etc. A must-have.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I never watched the series and was actually pretty oblivious to it, but it's pretty popular in \\"geek\\" culture and since I run in those circles, I got interested in watching the movie \\"Serenity\\", which was a sequel to the TV series. I figured I'd bone up on the back story and such by watching an episode or two from some online sources. After watching the first, I was hooked and just decided to purchase the whole DVD set. I haven't been disappointed. While it's kind of cheesy at times, I think that's part of the charm. The characters are fun, their interaction interesting, and the stories are engrossing. The bonus material is also...well...a bonus. Having never rented or bought a DVD of a TV series, I was also pleasantly surprised it was in widescreen format. Well worth the few Hamiltons spent.
B000MZHW40|5.0|This was the first Lenardo movie I was watching after \\"The Beach\\". The young lad in the movie of yesteryears was gone and I it was nice to see a great performance from Leonardo now very much into his manhood. The talented Jennifer Conolly does a great role too. The little romance that is there between Jennifer and Leonardo is lovely. Leonardo's character is also one that you'll learn to empathise and sympathise. As a white man living in a neighbouring country and being part of the illegal gem trade himself you wonder how many such lives are shattered by the political upheavals in these countries. The lines spoken by him when he narrates his story to Jennifer was moving, particularly \\"....at that time I though God left this place...\\" And what to say of Djmon Hnsou. These days he fits into roles like they were made for him. Nice to also see the villian of \\"The Mummy\\" series back in this movie.    Above all this the crime can never be forgotten. The crime is even worse. Atrocities such as rape of family members in the presence of other family members, forced incest sex in front of children etc., are all done to demoralize and destabilize child recruits and make them into remorseless hardcore fighters. Many of the soldiers are even young girls, often physically abused to the point of mental breakdown where sex is no longer a pleasure for them. Some fortunate child soldires have moved or have been rehabilitated in other countries. \\"Child soldier\\" written by one such female soldier now living in the Netherlands explains it all. And how all this exploitation goes on for material comforts and benefits of those who are either directly or indirectly perpetrating it is something this movie explains well.    The only annoying thing is the partying music played everytime the RUF is shown, even when they are on the rampage. This could have either been avoided or not overdone.    Lovely soundtrack to its credit with lots of Afro rythms, sounds and vocals. Reminds one of the soundsPaul Simon put into his album \\"Graceland\\" in the 80's. James Newton Howard's background score is beautiful too particularly in the romantic and the sentimental scenes.     Another observation and one that deserves worthy mention is the audio/sound effects of this movie and whoever was behind this deserves praise. Inspite of all the atrocities that are going on around, listen and you can still hear the birds in the trees and bushes singing and going about their lives happily and peacefully. To see unspoilt nature (now being spoilt on a large scale) as it is in Africa was also refreshing.    Go for it if you haven't watched it. Five stars.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Having watched \\"The Illusionist\\" quite recently, I felt compelled to post my review and personal opinion of this film on my MySpace Blog.  I hadn't even seen the trailer fully before I sat down to watch \\"The Illusionist\\" and had no idea what to expect from the DVD, but was deeply impressed with what I found.  There is not a single dull moment in this wonderful film, but it does not have that throw-it-all-at-you-at-once mood that so many other movies do.  Well written dialogue and an intense yet sometimes eerily calm plot line keeps things interesting throughout the whole film.  Each character has their own easily recognizable personality that understand how everything fits together is not difficult at all.  It took me some rewinding a re-watching of some scenes to grasp what was going on, but contrary to the norm, this is not even a minor annoyance with this film.  The more timed I watched a scene, the clearer the message became, and the more I noticed.  Minor, easily-overlooked bits of dialogue and events are crucial to the understanding of this film.  A wonderful, try-and-piece-it together movie that I would definitely recommend for everyone!!!!!!!

0375701427|4.0|In my review of \\"The Plot Against America\\", which was not very favorable, I vowed to give Mr. Roth a second chance by reading his Pulitzer Prize winning novel next. Actually, I read \\"Everyman\\", then I read \\"American Pastoral\\". I can say that I actually liked both books more than I did \\"The Plot Against America\\".<br />I think, at its core, \\"American Pastoral\\" is a very interesting work on introspection and how we perceive ourselves and how we perceive others and the image of ourselves that we project. In the middle of the book, I was convinced it was a truely great American Novel, encompassing family values and morals, cultural and religous stereotypes and political vicissitudes. But, toward the end I felt it was a bit long and rambling and lost some of its strength. In my previous review I wrote that I would not purchase another Roth novel if I was not impressed with this novel. I have bought three Roth novels. That is, likely, the end of my contributions to his vacation home fund.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|Patton is a great bio and war movie. Patton is accurate the dialouge when he slaps the solider at the hospital is word for word what was said. The combat scenes are realistic and the rivalry with Montgomery is. At Sicily Patton was determined to beat Montgomery to Messina and did at great cost.When Pattons army is going up those icy roads to releive Bastonge is one of the best parts, and a highlight of ww2. Patton has a great theme song. The opening speech is memorable George s. Patton was one of Americas greatest generals and this movie shows why.

B000A3OS14|2.0|Imagine you're attending a sales convention in a moderately large american city, circa about 1989, and you wander into the hotel lounge and there is a reasonably talented combo playing hits of the day at a leisurely tempo (in fact, all at more or less the same tempo), with a female vocalist of limited range and power singing lightly into the microphone. That's what this music sounds like, pretty much every track. There is very little of what I think of as \\"jazz\\" in it.  Little improvisation or different keys, meters or tempos.  This is \\"lite jazz\\" at best.  Maybe \\"lite bossa nova\\" is even more accurate.  The first track manages to hold up, since the lyrics support a seductive sex-kittenish treatment. After that, it was extremely vapid.  Take the ostinato out of With or Without You, slow it down and whisper it and what do you have?  A mediocre featureless cover.  When they took a cocktail lounge number like In the Air Tonight and made it even more \\"lounge,\\" it was more than I could take. And the singer on Purple Rain sounds like a 6th-grader reading off a lyric sheet (\\"purple rain, purple rain ... purple rain, purple rain .. purple rain, purple RAIN.\\"). That version would make any list of worst covers of all time.  Well, convention's over, time to pay up and get to the airport.
0812975219|3.0|The author appears to be suffering from lack of contact with people of his intellectual peerage.  He pauses long enough to doubt himself only nominally, and then in the \\"I may be wrong but I doubt it\\" spirit.      Some of his points are easily debunked by even the most general reasoning.  For example, he claims that if an interviewee for an employment position emphasizes his past performance, he (the author) makes an excuse to cut the interview short, because past performance is not a reliant indicator of future performance.   By natural selection, he will be left with interviewees who are ashamed or reluctant to talk about the past.  Given the two prior distributions, I'd take my chances with the posterior distribution of the interviewees who are proud of their past achievements.    People who see everything as being caused by a grand design are one extreme.  The author of this book is at the other.  The fact that both outlooks can exist in the same world, to me, proves that neither extreme can be correct.  In other words, it can't be proven whether events are ruled by randomness or grand design.  Credit the author for figuring out a way to make money by trodding the (incorrect) path less taken, at any rate.

(He also wrote most of the music for the That Thing You Do! soundtrack -- another one of the best soundtracks ever.)  Adam is amazingly talented and deserves a HUGE chunk of the credit for making this soundtrack a good one.    Hugh and Drew do a surprisingly great job with the material, too.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|This is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. It drags through scenes with no apparent meaning slow slow slow. I hated it.    When I want to read a story, I go to the bookstore or library...not to the movies. I wish someone would give Hollywood the message that in their search for \\"authenticity\\" the audience losres a lot. You can't watch the actors and read their lines at the same time. I like to watch actors as they are giving their interrpetation of the lines. Can't do it if I'm having to look below their faces to read what they are saying. It may have been lame but I liked it better when they used accents.    I don't go to movies to worship a filmmakers testy attempts to be called a genius. I just want to enjoy a good story. Booo Babel - 220 stars.

I had have expected to view this movie as more of a documentary, with lots of comments from ex-WWII Japanese vets.  I was pleasantly surprised when it presented the action, and drama of soldiers who know they have lost.  I was expecting to see the drama and carnage of the battle in Flags, and not a study is dissolution for those who were in the famous \\"planting the flag\\" picture.    Iwo Jima was a hard fought battle with tremendous losses on both sides.  The Japanese chose to give up the beaches, and defend from the high ground.  When the flag was planted, most thought the worst was over, but many times more casualties were realized after the big flag planting ceremony.  That's the story that was begging to be told. If the story in \\"Flags\\" was merely to convey the hypocrisy of the political war propaganda machine and its human price, as least they could have established that on the home front.  The movie \\"Letters...\\" handled that kind of conveying of emotion, almost seamlessly.     Motivations were better on display as well, the differing thoughts on saving face in a lost battle.  That it was better to die by one's own hand, or in a suicide charge rather than give yourself up to ones enemy.  One thing they really didn't capture was the mindset of the Japanese soldier, that American's were inferior as a race.  The attitude was touched on briefly in some of the Japanese dog soldier's conversation, but overall it was not apparent.  One thing they did do well, was put a human face on the act of war.  The soldiers who would have preferred the war be over, were just trying to survive their time.  Their wants and desires were depicted as essentially the same as most of us.    It was also not that much on display here, the brutality that has been attributed to the Japanese in battle.  Perhaps that's a behavior on display only when they win, but more likely it's a function of the leadership.  If the leaders have no respect for those which they conquer, their men can act with retribution, revenge and hatred.  In this story, some of the Japanese leaders had empathy for both their men, and even for America in some ways as the leader had spent time there and had American friends.  That made it difficult to think of them as sub-human.

B000GW8VTO|5.0|As many of the previous reviewers mentioned, I am a war movie fanatic.  I was not in the Vietnam war, but my father flew the Huey right through the thick of the battles, and has been a Bell Helicopter employee all his life.    I watched this movie with him w en it came out on DVD, three times in a row, and once again on HD.    Dad's not a movie type guy, and no Vietnam movie ever impressed him because of too much Hollywood flair and glorification.  This was completely different, he said it was the most realistic Vietnam war movie he had ever seen.      It was great listening to him point out parts of the movie and explaining how accurate a certain part was and how that's just how it was like on another part.    This movie still had some Hollywood flair to it, but when a movie can create that kind of impact on someone, and create an unforgetable evening spent with my father learning about his past, it is worth 5 + stars to me.  Especially when I had such high expectations after Braveheart and the movie still impressed me, that is why I am a Mel Gibson fan.    Great movie, one of the best!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|QotSA is a tremendous band...hands down.  This album is \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\".  Great song after great song.  Every true fan should \\"Suture up Your Future\\" and pick it up.  I owe a great debt to knuckledragger07 because I took my hands out of my pants, got up from my Indian style position in the corner, and I haven't looked back...thank you knuckledragger07.  After making \\"Misfit Love\\" to my wife, I drank some \\"Battery Acid\\" and listened to \\"3's & 7's\\" which should make R. Robertson puke 'cause its the best Queens song ever written...brings me back to their early albums, which I thought R. Robertson would enjoy....oh R. you dissapoint me.  Well, I'm off \\"Into the Hollow\\" to listen to this kick a** album.  Rock on!
B000002U6E|3.0|I would assume I'm one of the many who bought this CD on the basis of their one \\"hit\\", and was dissapointed.  Nothing wrong with the CD, it's just not as good as \\"Age of Innocence\\" was when it came out, and really seems dated now.
0321344758|5.0|At 200 pages, this book is probably the best must-read book on creating usable web sites. Krug introduces all of the main concepts of usability, in what he calls \\"advanced common sense\\" language.<br /><br />There are a lot of difference between web site usability and application usability... mainly because everybody uses web sites, so the audience is highly diverse, and they will leave your site for a better one relatively quickly. Usability has a lot to do with concise writing, intuitive structure, foolproof web forms, and the optimal blend of content and functionality. He covers many important topics including:<br /><br />  * how to write for the web<br />  * the difference between usability testing and focus groups<br />  * the fierce politics of the home page<br />  * navigation structures that work well<br />  * usability testing on a shoestring budget<br />  * how to interpret test results<br /><br />Even if you don't have the resources for a usability test -- in fact, especially if you don't -- you should get this book and follow his simple rules to make your web site ten times more usable.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Totally original, very true to the genre it was imitating.
B000K4WPCM|4.0|Hot bodies. Interesting, but stupid story. What more could you ask for?  Sometimes it's just fun to watch a mindless movie...and this one is it.  It looks great on Blu-ray too.
B000E1MTYU|4.0|The video quality is nothing short of spectacular.
B000093BDX|5.0|These are summer classics and to hear them again is a such a joy! It brings you back to the 60's (for those of us who remember the 60's). I bet the young people of today would get a kick out of listening to a pristine version of Surfin' USA, I Get Around, and some of the other classics.     Don't Worry, Baby is a personal favorite but it's the mono version. However, listening to it on a nice set of speakers makes it sound like it's in stereo. I would have liked \\"Warmth of the Sun\\" included in this collection but hey, 30 of the best Beach Boys songs on one CD, I'm not complaining!
B00004WEJZ|3.0|As much as I liked Connery as Bond, I just didn't like this movie.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|DT's new release is a solid disc-filled, 78-minute, journey that should please most fans and shows they still are on top of their game. Their intense musicianship and enduring passion to create great tunes and give it their all shines through on this disc, however, the lyrics still are their weakest link. Although they break no new ground in their musical styling, Portnoy's vocals, that used to make me cringe because of the sour notes he hit, have improved, or maybe I'm just getting used to them.     My least favorite tracks on \\"Systematic Chaos\\" are the last few minutes of \\"Repentance\\" with the dialog babble in the background, and I'm not a fan of the industrial-techno-disco-sounding riff on \\"Prophets of War\\". Otherwise, this disc is killer, the engineering and artwork are amazing, and this probably will be the best prog-metal release of the year.     The special edition DVD is a must and includes a behind the scenes \\"making of\\" feature and a 5.1 mix of the album. The 90-minute documentary is good and Portnoy's personality rules the film, but it's odd that John Myung didn't say anything through the entire feature. Was this how he wanted it? Some of his thoughts on the album would have been a treat. The 5.1 mix is awesome - full, thick, spacious and you can even hear the bass guitar, so get rid of the earbuds, buy a decent surround system, and crank it up!
B0007Y08QA|4.0|After watching it a few times, I can appreciate what they were trying to do with this film.  If you can, watch it when you're really, really, really tired.
B0000AZAUM|5.0|A great album on a great cd, shipped to me so fast I didn't know what it could be when I opened it...surely not the CD I just ordered!?!?
B000MR9D5E|5.0|A \\"must see\\" series.  Not more else to say about this one.  Buy it, watch it all.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Quick turnaround and great product.  This album is always classic, but with the new mix and the proper geat it will blow what's left of your brain cells.
B000E5KJFC|5.0|I thought this was a great movie anyway, in HD it's even better.
B000G759LW|5.0|This album is fantastic. She is truley and talented musician and really sets herself apart form all of the rest. Keep on doing what your doing!
B000FA57N0|5.0|In my opinion, Firefly was one of the best series on TV.  Too bad they screwed it up and it got cancelled.  But at least they got to make a movie, and the movie was quite good.  If you're a Firefly fan and have an HD player, this is a MUST HAVE.

B000GCFO0I|4.0|Has the same problems as all video-game based movies, it has a lot of hype to live up to, and it's target audience is small.  But overall I thought it was pretty well done.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|First off i dont know why this album is being bashed. i love the album. its GREAT! sure its a different sound. but not bad different. i was a little dissapointed that shinoda wasnt in this one as much but i still love it. the vocals are great! i listen to this album all the time. its not as good as meteora but i like it better than hybrid theory. and hybrid theory was a great album too. linkin park is a great band and i dont think they can make a bad album. but i do miss the anger of the previous two albums. id give it 4 1/2 stars.
B000M53GM2|3.0|I thought it was a very silly plot, and really, really disliked the Russian hacker.
B00000295Y|5.0|Okay, so the first CD I owned with rapping on it was, technically, C+C Music Factory, but forget that. 'Black Sunday' was the album that truly got me interested in hip-hop. Like every other white boy in America, I heard 'Insane in the Brain' on the radio and was hooked. Luckily, it's just about the worst song on the album.    From the siren-call that opens to the album to the syncopated beat in 'Break 'Em Off Some,' this album just doesn't quit comin' with dusty funk loops, rough-edge beats and hilarious herb references. The Amazon.com reviewer said this album presaged the sound of Dre's 'Chronic,' buuuuut according to Amazon's Web site, 'Chronic' was already out when this dropped in '93, so I'm not sure how they came up with that.    Regardless, I would argue that Muggs' and Dre's styles are not really very similar at all. Dre's sound was a lot more crisp, whereas Muggs opted for a smoky, vinyl-scratchy ambience that really suits the treble tones in B-Real and Sen Dog's voices.    I always make the argument that while 'Temples of Boom' was Muggs' best album in terms of production, 'Black Sunday' is the group's best album overall. I stand by it. A true hip-hop classic.

B0000029DD|5.0|The reason why this is actually the greatest male solo album of all time, is because no other album on earth has such a perfect harmony of so many genres of music - rock, pop, jazz, neo-soul, and even sufi melodies.<br /><br />I can safely say that twenty years from now, \\"Grace\\" will be hailed as probably the most important cultural document arising out of the rock movement of the 1900s. The passion here is more palpable that anything put out by say, The Beatles or Eric Clapton (geniuses in their own right). Its one thing to here people say \\"Oh, this is the greatest album ever!\\" and \\"Best Album of all time!\\", or when fans go \\"This makes the entire catalog of The Rolling Stones look like kindergarten!\\" - but that, dear reader, is the happy reality of this album - its better than almost all of the artists mentioned above. It really is.<br /><br />If you're new to Jeff Buckley, heres a quick rundown of what this album actually sounds like - take a 27 year old boy-man with a soaring, beautiful, jazz-suited voice, and hear him sing touching slow-rock songs, and some unlikely covers (\\"Lilac Wine\\" by Nina Simone, \\"Hallelujah\\" by Leonard Cohen). The voice is the instrument here. Production is flawless. He can sound like a little girl whose hearts' been broken for the first time, or a 70 year old singing from wisdom and experience - all on one song. If that isn't amazing, what is?<br /><br />For years now, I've held that Tori Amos' \\"Scarlet's Walk\\" is the greatest album ever recorded. Well, musically and conforming to my tastes, I'd have to say that the Amos album still ranks high on my list. But I listened to \\"Grace\\" when it first released in 1994, and its been a friend to me since then. What an experience that was, me as a gangly 17 year old with headphones on to shut the rest of the world of - Jeff Buckley was easy to idolize when you're that age, but what I didn't count on was this album becoming a permanent fixture in my life even in my thirties. I guess `timeless' would be the word, but I don't want to use adjectives here that I would use for just any other album.<br /><br />Many Tori Amos fans seem to love this album as well, even though Tori is a completely different sort of performer. While Amos sings primarily of life through her eyes (fair enough), Buckley reaches out to you and sings about YOUR life, which is something that not many singer-songwriters are capable of doing.<br /><br />If you haven't heard this before, lucky you! I can only imagine the goosebumps you're gonna get when you slide this CD into your player and hear the opening verse of \\"Mojo Pin\\", Track 1. The title track is a bonafide classic, but its on \\"Lilac Wine\\" that this album finally finds its wings and soars. How can a human voice sound like this, you ask yourself. If heaven was packaged in a three minute track on a CD, this would be it. Nothing can come close, and if the original songwriter were alive today I can only imagine his amazement at what it has been transformed to in Buckley's hands. Another ancient lyrics \\"Corpus Christi Carol\\" is just as stunning.<br /><br />Jeff Buckley died in 1997. Since then, this album has been hailed as a classic, but I find this to be quite cheap and derogatory, because its too easy to hail something once an artist is dead. I mean, I did like Nirvana, but lost all interest in them after their catalog was plundered and sold out to commercial gain upon Kurts' death. Thankfully, that hasn't quite happened to Jeff (though we have had a few posthumous releases, not of the magnitude of Nirvana, however), because Jeff was only starting his career and there wasn't a whole lot available to readily release. His estate, now in his mothers' hands, have released some Live albums, a double-CD of his unfinished work, and a DVD, but nothing compares to \\"Grace\\" which is the only album he released in his lifetime.<br /><br />You know, in this world, its hard to find a thing of beauty that retains its' power and hold over you. Friends come and go, relationships fade away, and family sometimes isn't all its cut out to be. I find that music has been my sole companion through most of lifes' ups and downs, and \\"Grace\\" has been a constant support. In times of highs or lows, all I need to do is to listen to \\"Lilac Wine\\" or \\"Eternal Life\\" and its' as if fresh new liquid energy is being poured into me by some divine entity (well, the experience is other-worldly, for sure). But more than that, it's a thing of wonder that a record soon celebrating fifteen years of release has been a constant soundtrack to my life, mirroring my moods and emotions, and being the best friend through it all. For this, I can only thank Buckley. I bet even he didn't know what he was creating.<br /><br />The new version of \\"Grace\\" is entitled the \\"Legacy Edition\\" and I highly recommend you get that over the single-CD version. Yes, the single CD version is what Jeff released originally, but this new version, supervised by his mother, is what I now consider the most essential version of this album. Its my No. 1 Desert island disc (over Amos' Scarlet's Walk\\" in its' current form). The second disc, in my opinion is not `better' than the first disc, its just `different'.<br /><br />The most beautiful new track here is the shimmering ballad \\"Forget Her\\", which had been spoken of for years, but now that we have it, it exceeds our expectations. This has got to be the most underrated rarity of all Buckley's work. There is also the long `Kanga Roo', and the amazing `Mama, you be on my mind'. I must say though, that the second disc, save for Track 1, has a rougher, edgier sound, but at no point do these sound like `demos' or `cheap live recordings' as many people assume them to be. In fact, even though it probably didn't go through the multi-layered studio instrumentation as the first disc did, the second is just as well produced and impeccably put together, and is a worthy addition to the catalog. For those of us who were fans of the original CD, this new Legacy Edition is the most glorious musical occasion in recent memory.<br /><br />The Legacy Edition, while bestowing the album with the greater respect it deserves, also offers us a DVD with all Jeff's official music videos, with a documentary thrown in as well. This definitive 3-Disc package is the way to go, if you need to get \\"Grace\\".<br /><br />Throughout my life, I've always been fascinated and felt kinship toward Buckley due to his obsession and love for Sufism and the Qawwali genre of music. He was a follower of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and in fact, one of Nusrat's posthumous releases is even dedicated to Buckley. While \\"Grace\\" does not have any songs of this nature, I find that Buckley's voice is strangely very \\"exotic\\" sounding in places, almost as if he were channeling a Moslem preacher from the wilds of the Afghan highlands (I'm sure Jeff would consider this a compliment). Listen to this album again, and note what I'm saying here - his voice is just so adaptable and I think that he channels Nusrat in more than a few places on this record. Now, this is a fabulous experience, and I only understood the relevance of this years later, when I read an interview that Buckley did with Nusrat during a US tour. Jeff also lists Patti Smith (one of my musical gurus) as one of his icons (he even toured with her at one point), and her influence upon his music is quite evident (traces of her debut album are present through strains of \\"Grace\\").<br /><br />Let me not mince words - \\"Grace\\" is the best thing to happen to the world of music, since, well... ever. This is one album that not many people know about, but those who do most certainly live a charmed life upon possession of this record. If your musical inclinations and `best-ofs' lie with \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"The White Album\\", well, what can I say. You've certainly missed out on what is obviously the true blueprint for what music ought to be based on. This is genre bending, music-revolutionizing stuff here, and you should do yourself a favor and just buy this.<br /><br />I would also highly recommend the new Legacy Edition of \\"Live at Sin-E\\", which is actually Jeff's first album. It was released early on as an EP, and now has been extended into a mega two-hour event. What a treat! Other than the usual tracks, the standout for me on this record is \\"Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hain\\", which was incidentally the first song by Khan that Jeff ever heard. I would say that if you're reading this review, check out the link above to this Live set, and add to your cart. I know that it's a pretty obvious endorsement, but I'd really like you to get both these Legacy Edition records and listen to them. These are records you NEED to own.<br /><br />To sum things up, what we have here is the Greatest Male Solo Record of all time. It breaks new ground, reinvents a whole new genre, and introduces you to the most beautiful male voice I have ever heard. I cannot recommend this album highly enough.<br /><br />If Music were Religion, consider this your Bible.<br /><br />Five Stars - Jeff Buckley, you will be missed.recent memory.

For those of us who were fans of the original CD, this new Legacy Edition is the most glorious musical occasion in recent memory.<br /><br />The Legacy Edition, while bestowing the album with the greater respect it deserves, also offers us a DVD with all Jeff's official music videos, with a documentary thrown in as well.

He was a follower of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and in fact, one of Nusrat's posthumous releases is even dedicated to Buckley. While \\"Grace\\" does not have any songs of this nature, I find that Buckley's voice is strangely very \\"exotic\\" sounding in places, almost as if he were channeling a Moslem preacher from the wilds of the Afghan highlands (I'm sure Jeff would consider this a compliment). Listen to this album again, and note what I'm saying here - his voice is just so adaptable and I think that he channels Nusrat in more than a few places on this record. Now, this is a fabulous experience, and I only understood the relevance of this years later, when I read an interview that Buckley did with Nusrat during a US tour. Jeff also lists Patti Smith (one of my musical gurus) as one of his icons (he even toured with her at one point), and her influence upon his music is quite evident (traces of her debut album are present through strains of \\"Grace\\").<br /><br />Let me not mince words - \\"Grace\\" is the best thing to happen to the world of music, since, well... ever.

You've certainly missed out on what is obviously the true blueprint for what music ought to be based on. This is genre bending, music-revolutionizing stuff here, and you should do yourself a favor and just buy this.<br /><br />I would also highly recommend the new Legacy Edition of \\"Live at Sin-E\\", which is actually Jeff's first album. It was released early on as an EP, and now has been extended into a mega two-hour event. What a treat! Other than the usual tracks, the standout for me on this record is \\"Yeh Jo Halka Halka Suroor Hain\\", which was incidentally the first song by Khan that Jeff ever heard. I would say that if you're reading this review, check out the link above to this Live set, and add to your cart. I know that it's a pretty obvious endorsement, but I'd really like you to get both these Legacy Edition records and listen to them.

075640407X|5.0|I am always skeptical of new fantasy series and new authors. The combo of both first novel and new series usually is enough to send me running. However, this book was well reviewed by Entertainment Weekly so I decided to give it a try. Even though it is over 600 pages in length, the story moves very fast and is exceptionally well written. It is told in the 1st person which is unusual for this genre and is usually another red flag. However, it works really well for this story and the character development. It reminds me of early Robert Jordan or Terry Goodkind with a bit of Rowling thrown in but is much more grounded in the \\"real world\\". The author has created a believable world, a moving story and strong characters. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre as well as those who are fans of well written novels.
B00003CXWV|1.0|I did not receive this product at all, I tracked its progress and it said it was sent to me, but I never did receive, I attempted to contact Amazon about this order and there was no reply.  I was very dissatisfied and felt like someone stole my money.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|Beautifully shot and well edited series. I wish it had foot notes                                                                                                                      verify the script. Learned new facts about our planet and its inhabitants. Worth the time and money.
B00005M91K|5.0|One of the best movies ever.  It shows it doesn't take more than nature and imagination to do a strong film.
B00005QAPH|4.0|Unfortunately, for the most part 8½ left me cold, one of those films where you get what is being done but it's just not on your wavelength. It's pointless to complain about it being hit-and-miss or confused, since erratic confusion is the nature of the beast as Fellini becomes possibly the first man to film his own nervous breakdown (or at very least his crisis of creativity). In many ways the turning point in Fellini's career where fantasy and grotesquery would become an increasing part of increasingly disjointed phantasmagorias with a design style as cluttered as a tart's dressing table, there are moments that strike home and the latter scenes with his wife and with Claudia work because there's a sense of self-awareness of Fellini's limitations not just as an artist but as a human being. But overall I was just left with the feeling that I'd got on the wrong train by mistake.<br /><br />(Incidentally, to strike a timely note, it's amusing to note that the producer's brainless bimbo girlfriend is the spitting image of Paris Hilton!)<br /><br />It's a shame Criterion's otherwise excellent 2-disc DVD couldn't locate the deleted sequences, although they are represented in the excellent stills galleries. Alongside the 50-minute 'Director's Notebook' documentary TV special by Fellini, the 45-minute German Nino Rota documentary is interesting and has a wonderful moment where the composer accepts a proffered cigarette only to turn down a light because he doesn't smoke!
B000O5AYCA|4.0|Just what rock music needs...another over-hyped, next-big thing, saviors of rock and roll band. However The National has been around for a few years now, and may just be deserving of some hype.     At least half of the songs are awesome, especially Fake Empire, Slow Show, Start A War and the amazing Ada. They still have that post-punk Cure/Psychedlic Furs/Joy Divison thing going on; but instead of simply mimicking bands from that genre, they add their own signature.     There is not as much variety in the music as on Alligator and a sense of sameness starts to pervade before the album ends. And the drumming, part of what made Alligator such a satisfying release, almost gets in the way here. But these are small quibbles. The National is a band to reckon with!    The National takes elements that on the surface would seem to be incongruous--somber chamber music with almost breakneck speed percussion cobbled with the singers dour, impenetrable poetry. On paper it sounds like it would be a mess. On disc it is quite compelling.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|This latest version of \\"To Catch A Thief\\", has ADDED footage that NEVER appeared in the original theatrical release or subsequent full screen VHS, and first go around Widescreen mono DVD format (2002). This movie was filmed in High-Fidelity sound (STEREO) that has thus been restored for this Special Collectors Edition. It now has Dolby Digital English 2.0 Surround sound , where picture quality and colors are without description, the way it was originally intended to be!!  Of course, I do own a big screen (widescreen) Digital HD projection set with an equally Digital HD excellent playbak quality DVD player and equal Dolby Digital 7.1 Stereo sound system to match and thus may be the reason why it looks the way it does. This new Special Collectors Edition has been so cleaned up, that it matches or even surpasses any of the new modern DVD releases out there now. I HIGHLY recommend this timeless Hitchcok classic, in it's all NEWLY RESTORED version!!!!

B000E1MTZE|5.0|As the high definition wars wage on the argument goes back and forth as to the future of HD-DVD and Blu-Ray (watch everyone's jaw drop when a third format comes out of left field and ends up winning).  For those of us who are fortunate to have HD-DVD players, the faithful day that we get a really great movie that was MADE for HD has come.  The Matrix Trilogy is a great storyline that comes equipped with killer special effects and beautiful scenery.  In the HD-DVD installment, the picture is so precise and crisp that I spent half the time I was watching it trying to take in background items I was never able to see on the DVD version.    The sound is incredible and with uncompressed Dolby, the opening explosion scene of Matrix: Reloaded had my non-tech buddies giving an impressed \\"wow\\".  The encoding has almost no flaws (on the discs I recieved they all played all the way through without stalling once) and the occassional grain found in 1st generation HD-DVD and Blu-Ray is non-existent on this boxed set.    Xbox 360 owners even get a free standard definition download of Animatrix, making this set definitely worth the price.      If you own HD-DVD, it's because of movies like these.  Purchasing this boxed set should be a no-brainer (although I would avoid the ultimate collection on HD as only the movies are in HD, just like this boxed set).      NOTE TO XBOX 360 OWNERS: Make sure to get your system online and download the spring 07 update for your system (if you haven't already;  you'll now have a \\"Marketplace\\" blade if you have) as well as the HD-DVD update patch that should download automatically once you play a newer HD-DVD (the Matrix definitely qualifies).
B000003TAL|5.0|sonic youth is not for everyone.they have a raw style which is anything but pretty and radio-freindly.with that said they're also one of the most inventive bands to come along in quite some time because of the risks they've taken and how they approach song composition.if you can stand a little noise from a band who are trying to sound beautiful in a much different way than most,give em a try and you shouldn't be dissapointed!
B00005JPLW|4.0|Okay, I am a girl.  But I do always love to go with my husband and friends to see great action and drama.  This movie was wonderful.  The graphics and special effects were amazing.  I had an open mind when I went to see the film the first time.  The second time, I loved it even more.  I went with husband and brother-in-law.  Brother-in-law is a huge comic and graphic novel expert and absolutely loved it (also liked it more the second time around).  My b-i-l says that the movie is a great rendition of the graphic novel, keeping true to much of the original feeling that the novel conveys.  I would highly recommend this film to anyone - just remember that there is a lot of \\"gore.\\"  If you can get through Kill Bill and see it for its artistic beauty, then you can certainly do the same for this movie.  It is a beautiful film!
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren does an amazing job of impersonating the Queen. She describes her work as a kind of \\"portrait\\", that is to say, she cannot mimic the Queen exactly, but like a portrait painter has to give an impression of her. That she does marvelously, so that after viewing the film it is almost difficult to recall the actual Queen as she really is. The depictions of Prince Philip and Prince Charles are less successful. \\"Tony Blair\\" on the other hand is almost as good as the Queen. Other pluses are being able to see the insides of Balmoral Castle, as well as the protocol that governs the visits of the PM  to see the Queen. What is also fascinating is the revelation (I suppose it is accurate) that the royal family thought the divorce had essentially banished Diana from their lives and that they could get on with things without bothering about her any longer. Fat chance! Her death and the surrounding problems brought her back into their midst with a vengeance. She wasn't ready to just fade away quite yet.
B000FIUPA2|2.0|I sure wish I knew what this product is.  I've looked everywhere for it, but no one seems to know of a dual disk on this title.  Was this a limited edition?    NIGHT FLY would be a prime candidate for a dual disk edition with 5.1 surround and all that noise, because it is a solid and layered recording.  So I would alert the record company to make this more widely available or give us more information as to how we could get it!!
B00005JPQP|2.0|I looked forward to seeing Ocean's Thirteen, but within ten minutes of the movie starting, I could tell it was going to be a let down.  WAY too much time was spent talking about and setting up the plot.  I found myself saying, \\"Come on, lets get on with the movie\\" several times.  When the \\"action\\" finally started to happen, I was disappointed with that, as well.  I was hoping to see something clever, with some action scenes, and fun, but this movie did not deliver.  The storyline was weak.  The acting wasn't good, although I did enjoy seeing Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, and Ellen Barkin.  I love George Clooney, but this is definitely not his best work.  Save your money and make this a rental, or just skip it all together.
B000NA28IE|3.0|I will admit I had been skeptical about the movie but I thought \\"what the hey, I'll check it out\\". I should have read the books first. Really I should have. I spent the entire time watching this movie with my mother and could not help but sit back making little cracks in hopes to lighten the disappointment I felt for it. Some of the acting was a little stale. Some of the scenes could have been built up so much better. The movie felt like it was made entirely too fast and left out a lot of substance. It could have been so, so much better. Kind of like with the Dungeons and Dragons movie with Marlon Wayans.
0316010669|4.0|This book is a prototypical bestseller...entertaining and just vague enough to appeal to a mass of readers, whether they are firm believers in love at first sight, analytical engineers or somewhere in between. This book is a bestseller precisely because it will validate your thinking no matter where you fall in the spectrum. Hopefully it will also challenge you to rethink how analytical and/or how emotional your decision-making process really is.    What stood out to me about the book was how Gladwell proves the main thesis of his book: that your subconscious is capable of filtering out superfluous information in order to make snap judgments based on the few details that really matter. His proof lies in various examples of how experts in particular fields can within seconds create a diagnosis (even without understanding or acknowledging all of the symptoms).     One of the examples he uses is of a professor who has been studying couples' communication for many years. This professor can apparently, within 30 seconds of viewing a taped dialogue between a couple, determine with 95 percent accuracy whether or not the couple will last. The proof of Gladwell's point is supposed to come from the fact that increasing the amount of taped dialogue viewed by the professor does not improve his accuracy.      It was not lost on me, however, that all of Gladwell's core examples (including the professor) involve experts who have been studying their particular fields for many years. This is not something clearly pointed out in the book, but something that certainly deserves mention. It would be easy for an inexperienced investor to walk away after reading this book with the notion that he or she should make more investment decisions by trusting in his or her gut. Yet the proof of Gladwell's point relies on people with large amounts of specialized experience.     Gladwell does make a valid point that many people spend too much time fretting over the minutia. This is all too true ininvesting. Many investors acquire too much information, much of which is probably irrelevant (or at least too unpredictable to quantify as part of an investment decision). This can lead to either making decisions based on unimportant variables or in complete investment paralysis.     Here's hoping you discover someplace in between,     Jeremy Ames, Executive Editor
0141182601|4.0|This is a fascinating and provocative novel that questions what it means to be good.  Is a law abiding person still good if they have no free-will; if their mind has been altered so that they are incapable of violence?<br /><br />The novel is written from the perspective of 15 year old Alex, a charming sociopath who enjoys `ultra violence'.  Alex writes in a street slang of Burgess' own devising called Nadsat (although it is derived largely from Russian). This may be off-putting to some readers initially, but after a few pages you start to get the hang of it, and before long, you start to like it. (I am resisting the temptation to write my review using Nadsat).<br /><br />When the novel was first published in the US in the 1960's, the 21st chapter was not included.  Burgess felt the final chapter was important but he needed money and agreed to have the novel published without it.  The final chapter changes the tone of the novel.  I have to say that I agree with the original American publishers.  I found the final chapter a little too optimistic.<br /><br />Burgess wanted to present a world where there was hope that even criminal sociopaths can choose to be good without the state forcing goodness on them.  I on the other hand, prefer the nastier (and I think) more realistic ending that the original US version gave us.<br /><br />Burgess felt that the real evil in A Clockwork Orange lay with the state (don't get me wrong, I'm not in favor of radical behavioral controls like the ones administered to Alex) and as a result, he seems to excuse Alex's violent behavior as if it were only a `phase' he might outgrow.<br /><br />Because Alex is charming and because much of the violence is described in a strangely unfamiliar slang, the reader may be desensitized to it and may even sympathize with Alex (something I think Burgess wanted).  In reality, Alex is a self absorbed sociopath who rapes little girls and beats little old ladies to death.  Even after his reconditioning, he still wants to be violent (he just can't) and he shows absolutely no remorse for any of the crimes he has committed. Alex may or may not be able to change his behavior and 'choose good' but it's difficult for me to imagine that he is capable of feeling compassion or empathy, let alone find love.<br /><br />I prefer the sarcastic and cynical ending to Chapter 20.  While Burgess may have intended the 21st chapter to give us hope, I actually think this chapter is the scariest part of the novel.  The only thing more frightening to me than Alex roaming the streets with violence on his mind - is picturing him as a father.<br /><br />That would be a real horror show.<br /><br />Regardless of which ending you prefer, there is no doubt that this is a fascinating novel, well worth reading.

B000002C1W|1.0|This is a pathetic attempt for the Roger Waters-less Pink Floyd to carry on without their heart and soul. Roger was self-centered, sure, but his lyrics and bass were both key parts of the Floyd Sound that this album horribly misses. Basically, it's useless. Nostalgiac about the early '70s, back when they would make ungodly amounts of money off of Dark Side of the Moon and such, \\"three-quarters\\" Floyd decided they'd try to recreate that sound, using lots of synthesizers, female backing vocals, saxes and studio effects. The resulting album is, far and away, Pink Floyd's nadir.<br />It's hard for me to tell what the album's lowest low is. I know I hate the mechanical hit Learning to Fly. But that's not all. The Dogs of War was voted as Pink Floyd's worst song ever, and I must say I agree. Basically it's a pathetic attempt to rewrite the classic Dogs - even the titles are similar! Give me a break here, guys! Arguably even worse than that is Signs of Life (which could very well win the \\"Joe Strummer Most Ironic Title Ever\\" award), the rather awkward On the Turning Way, and the A New Machine/Terminal Frost/A New Machine suite. I guess the closing Sorrow is okay - good guitar part, processed and mid-'80s as it is, and I like the lyrics just fine, but no way it's a nine-minute song, you know? And is that a DRUM MACHINE I hear?<br />Momentary Lapse hasn't aged very well, and like the following Division Bell it was a very bad idea. Thankfully, Pink Floyd's '70s output was so good that this will never tarnish their deserved reputation as rock legends. But that doesn't keep it from being arguably PF's worst.

B000HEVZ8K|5.0|I caught this print on the HDMovie channel on DirecTV and knew this had to be one of the first HD DVDs that I purchased! WOW!  Universal is really giving their classic library the star treatment- fully restored from the original cinerama widescreen prints The Searchers on a big screen is like going back in time and spending an afternoon at the movies when movies were more than just explosions and effects. GORGEOUS scenery- Monument Valley has never looked so big and bright.  John Wayne is restored to his larger than life status- I just wish my grandfather was still around to see the Duke like this. I hope a whole new generation can find these great films and enjoy them as much as I do!
B000P6R6X8|5.0|I own every Wilco album, and I really think they are all GREAT....but this one is clearly the best.  Buy it today -- it won't leave your car's CD player for months.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|I have never read the comics and I have no previous knowledge on any Ghost Rider history or background...but I know that having to sit through this movie for 2 hours was like being in hell...which was fitting, since a lot of the movie had to do with just that...hell.<br /><br />  The movie is visually appealing. The effects are decent (although I must admit that I am about 75% anti-CG1 effects in films) and the director did a great job with what he had...but the movie suffers from a seriously ignorant plot-line.<br /><br />  The acting was WAY over the top. Nicholas Cage is horrible and I sometimes have to slap myself when I remember he won an academy award back in the 90's. The guy can't act! I dont know how he even gets work!! Eva Mendez is beautiful and lovely to look at, but her character felt so \\"OFF\\" to me. There are no words to describe how odd she seemed in this role, and watching her and Nicholas Cage kiss was one of the most painful cinematic events I have ever witnessed. It was like watching an Uncle make out with his neice. it was just creepy.<br /><br />  This movie just didn't appeal to me. I kind of regret even paying the rental fee for it. Just a warning.
B00007LTIA|5.0|From the time I first started listening to FM radio, way back in 1980, I was always fascinated by Yes.  I didn't know much about them, but I was hooked the first time I ever heard \\"Long Distance Runaround/The Fish.\\"    Then a neighbor who was also a fan bought a copy of \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" and very graciously loaned it to me...and it became my favorite Yes album at once.  It still is.  If the Who's \\"Tommy\\" was the first rock opera, I would venture to call \\"Topographic Oceans\\" the first rock -symphony-.  Its four movements roughly follow symphonic form, although a bit slower than a classical symphony; the notable exception is \\"The Ancient,\\" which is -definitely- a scherzo, especially at the first!  One can even detect recurring themes, introduced in \\"The Revealing Science of God\\" and later developed in other movements.  As always, Jon Anderson's lyrics are quite surrealistic, but like the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins or e. e. cummings, they are easier to understand if they are read as clusters or word pictures.  And the music that surrounds and interweaves the lyrics is so unbelievably complex that even now I can listen to this album and hear something new; that's a rarity for any piece of music at any time, and if I were to give one reason for buying this album, that would be it.  Caveat auditor(let the listener beware), however: if you aren't at least somewhat familiar with classical music, you might find this album tough going at first.  But if you give it a chance, I think you will find your perseverance rewarded.
B000O77RL4|4.0|Though slow at times, this movie is sure to be a classic.  Better at second viewing.
B000004286|5.0|I actually heard the soundtrack before I saw the movie, which, concerning music by Mr. James Horner, is very likely to be the case with me. This powerful score of epic songs is the epitome of a soundtrack, in my opinion, with so much depth and dynamics, I argue it does not even need a movie. Track 5, Attack on Murron, for example, has been used in numerous movie trailers that are not even affiliated with Braveheart. This score is worth the money!
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This Series is really great. It's creepy, funny and sexy. The main actors Jensen Ackles, Jared Padalecki and of course Jeffrey Dean Morgan plays this family and their relationship really good. Besides the problem of finding their dad, the two brothers fight against demons and safe people's life.  With their own way's.  I like this series because the actors are fresh and the concept (Buffy meets The X-Files) is so refreshing. There is no episode which is boring. The finale is so exciting that I barely can't wait for the second Season at September 11th.  Watch and enjoy it.
0486440915|4.0|I thought I would have trouble getting into one of those \\"old, frilly romances.\\" Picking up this novel with great doubt, I delved into a beautiful love story with enough humor (especially directed at the character Mrs. Bennet) to keep my interest perked, as well as delicious twists and secrets among the characters that make this a stunning work of art. Austen makes a simple romance a page-turner.
0618680004|4.0|Dawkins new book is undoubtedly something religious individuals will detest, since its title alone is offensive.  While I agree personally with Dawkins general perspective--primarily that the burden of proof is on religion, and thus far religion has failed to substantiate its claims of importance in the role of people and societies--I find his approach a little off-putting.    It's easy to see how moderately religious people might be offended by the language in this book.  While reading, I wonder at the possibility of any religious folk reading the text at all, but I still feel the importance of reading the book from the perspective of a religious person, in order to judge the likely effect.  After all, Dawkins isn't really telling me anything that I don't already know or am not prepared to seriously consider, so I have no fear of being offended.  I think that titling a chapter \\"Why There is Almost Certainly No God\\" is just a bit brazen and might hinder the deliverance of the message.  One would think that a subtle delivery would reach more readers.    Overall, this book is dead on.  Dawkins scolds nearly all religions and uses as his primary case the Christian religion, since it almost seems that he is targeting American readers more than any (it might be true that he will sell more books in the USA than anywhere else, even further proving his point that there are more atheists than we realize).  With the Christian god as his primary case, Dawkins brings to light (though not very concretely) the contradictions within this god's character, and then the reason why he most certainly does not exist.    The author's primary goal here is to get people to think objectively about the possiblity of the existence of a god or gods, something he himself states is highly unlikely.  He sucessfully demonstrates the possiblities that await an atheist, secularist society.  His contrast between the words of the USA's founding fathers and the USA's current state is nothing short of astounding.  By following along with Dawkins, it's easy to see how this country has become so backwards and full of hypocrisy.    Richard Dawkins may seem subversive, brazen and unkind, but he is undoubtedly honest.  This above all makes this book worth reading.  He holds nothing back and favors no religion.  Because of this, Dawkins isn't afraid to give readers painful portraits of the effects of religion on society.    I give it 4 stars for its honesty and gutsy presentation.  Christians and Muslims clearly won't like it (and may even express this sentiment violently), but that only reinforces Dawkins' argument.
0679409874|3.0|I used to wonder why so many people preferred Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. What differences were dynamic enough to make so many people sway? I read the novel and was intrigued, yet not as much as I was when reading Pride and Prejudice.<br />Sense and Sensibility is a delightful story with characters easy to fall in love with. You automatically root for Elinor at the drop of a hat, and though we prefer to think of Marianne as someone completely different from ourselves, we resist reproaching her and root for her instead. Though I wouldn't call it Austen's best, this book is a great way to pass time, especially on a shaded porch swing in a drizzle.
1400079179|5.0|\\"Unfortunately for Langdon, he had turned out to be more than a tutor tonight. He had become the target of Bezu Fache... and some unseen force intent on possessing the Holy Grail.<br /><br />`Whatever the Grail turns out to be.'<br /><br />Sophie wondered if it was worth her life.\\"<br /><br />This was a line from the now famous book called The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown. He is also the writer of the novel Angels and Demons. This intriguing fictional story is one of action, adventure, clues and mystery. The main character in this book is Robert Langdon. His job is to look for deeper meanings in things like religion and art.<br /><br />He's in France on a tour of his new book, when he gets a call from the police asking him to come look at a murder because there is something strange about this one. When he shows up at the Louve (a famous art museum in Paris), there is some thing different. The man who was murdered laid himself out, imitating Leonardo da Vinci's famous Virtuvian Man. The man left clues for Robert to supposedly find his murderer. But it turns out to be much more than that. The clues lead Robert, and Sophie Nevue on a wild goose chase all over the globe to find none other than THE Holy Grail. With never ending plot twists and outstanding characters, this book is for everyone who loves a good story.
B0000035E7|5.0|One reviewer said that the playing was better here because Kurt only played rhythm, but Jason Everman joined the band after the album was recorded and only got his name in the credits because he paid for the recording.  That being said, this is a great album and the Nirvana album I listen to most.  Every song is great, even the ones that aren't.  I've been listening to Nirvana for years and this is the only record of theirs that I can listen to nonstop without getting tired of after awhile.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card  <br />Review by Wade Rediger  <br />  <br />  <br />\\"I've watched through his eyes, I've listened through his ear, and I tell you he's the one. Or at least as close as we're going to get.\\"  <br /> Ender Wiggins is 7 years old. Taken from home, surrounded by enemies, impossible odds, and no hope. After all he is Earth's last hope. Although, young and a `third', he soars to the top of his battle training. Always finishing his superiors' orders and making up the rules as he goes. Though, time is of the essence and an alien `buggers' invasion looms over Earth. Ender, the wonder child, is put to the test. He is predestined to lead Earth's defense and retaliation attack against the `buggers'.  <br /> The entire book, every page, was truly entrancing. Yet, I won't spoil it for you, but the ending is what separates this book, what makes it better than all the other sci-fi books out there. It is ingenious, unusual, and different, but it draws you in and you reread the ending for days, just to take it in. The twist of what happens to Earth and what becomes of Ender is shocking and unexpected to a new level that I have never read in a book before.  <br /> Ender's Game is by far the best book I have ever read. The details, dialogue, visuals, and sensory Scott Card uses forms an remarkable bond between you and the characters, especially Ender and his family. You learn to love ender, learn to feel his world, and eventually learn to believe in him. Scott Card makes you hate the characters Ender hates, and love those he loves. I felt close to Ender because he reminded me of any other regular child and even of me as I was when little.      <br />I gained a personal connection and relationship to the main characters because each character resembles common personality traits that everyone has. You feel as though you are right in the story involved in the plot. You want to reach out and touch the characters. Scott Card bridges the gap from reality to imagination.   <br />Ender's Game reminds us that our future, our hopes for earth always lies with the youth; they control the balances of power. More importantly Scott Card emphasizes the theory throughout the book that death not being an end, but rather a beginning for something new.  <br />Is there enough time? Can Ender save the human race from the impending `bugger' threat?  <br />
0743298020|5.0|I haven't devoured and relished every single word of a book since A.S. Byatt's 'Possession' was released back in 1990.  This magnificently crafted story is just wonderful, filled with intrigue, suspense and riveting emotion.  I absolutely loved this book!!!!
0156027321|5.0|Pie is good and pie is great but Pi is also in trouble. Yann Martel wrote a fantastic novel about a teenage boy and a 400lb bangle tiger at sea in a lifeboat. Yann Martel, a Canadian author that has traveled the world to write his books, has also written other books including Seven Stories, The Facts Behind the Helsinki Roccamatios, and Self.   Life of Pi is about a very lucky kid who survives a terrible ship wreck with all of his father's zoo animals on board. Miraculously some crew men saw him and threw him over board onto a life boat with an orangutan, zebra, hyena, and a bangle tiger named Charlie Parker. Now he Must survive all what the open sea throws at him. Eventually he finds an island with a \\"village\\" of meerkats living on it. Hooray! He's saved! But not for long. He Has to leave the island and keep on searching for the right kind of land. In the end, Pi never really finds what he is looking for.  The best part(s) in the book would have to be all the tid bits about the different animals that he encounters. Take the Dorado for example, when you kill them, they will changer color. Pi survives on this fish as well as others in his journey at see.   I would have to say that the main idea/ theme of this book is to never give up on anything or lose hope. If Pi was out at see for his whole life, he would never have given up on searching for land even when his emergency food supply was out. No matter what life throws at you, always persevere and keep going.   Life of Pi was an excellent book and a worth while read. The Beginning starts out a bit boring but really picks up and turns into a real page turner. Anyone who likes a page turner and an ocean adventure will definitely love this book.
B000MNP2KI|3.0|No slam to Daniel Craig intended - I enjoyed him tremendously in Tomb Raider (particularly the shower scene? ;-)  That said, perhaps I just can't get past the inconsistencies in this film.  To name a few:    1.  It is supposed to be Bond before/as he gets his 00 status.  Yet, Judi Dench is M.  Now, I think she is tremendous as M, but it doesn't fit the chronology.  I suspect she was used to pull in the fans as a familiar face in the franchise and while I understand the logic and love seeing her act whenever possible, it was not the best solution for this film.    2.  The use of current technologies bugged me the whole time.  Like, how did Vesper Lynd get a Blackberry??  Cell phones everywhere??  No really cool gadgets, but technology that didn't belong.    3.  WHERE IS Q??????????  Now sadly I am very well aware that Desmond Llewellyn couldn't play the role but the interaction between Bond and Q is a classic part of Bond lore that is sorely missing in this film.  They should have cast someone as the precursor to the Q we have known and loved through countless 007 films.    I have every James Bond film and I fell asleep the first 4 times I watched this film.  I still don't really remember the end without having to really think about it.  The action was more like an Urban war movie, the gadgets - well, wrong.  I found the passion between Bond and Lynd unconvincing and just really didn't care one way or the other how it all came out I'm sorry to say.  As unpopular as it may be to say, I think the lions share of the blame lies with the script. I know from the special features that Cubby wanted to transform this book into film for decades but this implementation just didn't make it for me. I so very much hope that the next one recaptures the magic of James Bond.  Not just the unusual locales, the gadgets, Q and M, but the chemistry, witty dialog and sardonic humor that infects the most enjoyable of the franchise productions.  I just don't get the pure fun and enjoyment out of this one that I get watching other Bond films.
0385340540|4.0|The Broker, The Partner, and The Summons are not at all related to each other except for the fact that John Grisham created them all and they all rock. Since I read The Broker, my first Grisham creation, I fell in love with his style and creative writing.  Most of The Broker is set in Italy where Joel Backman a big time Washington power broker, is relocated after being suddenly pardoned from federal prison. He is smuggled into Italy by the CIA. They give him a whole new identity, name, social security number, family, background, everything. Joel Backman now Marco Lazzeri has to act, think, and speak like a true Italian to stay alive. Are the CIA really trying to help him get back on his feet? And if so, why can't he talk to his family and why does he feel like he's always being watched?  This book is so well written; it draws you in and doesn't let you go until the last page. It has the action, \\"Tin man likes his bombs,\\" and the romance, the pretty Italian woman. Considering Joel Backman has been married 4 times, he's bound to fall in love living in the heart of Italy. But then Backman is in a life or death situation, does he stick to the rules that the CIA has laid out for him? Or does he choose to run his own race for life and dodge the bullets that the people trying to find him shoot?  When Grisham wrote this book I believe that he wanted people to see that the world isn't fair. The people who break the rules will still come out on top. But then also, that the people who cheat the system are gambling with their lives. This is because Joel Backman ruined a lot of people's lives and became filthy rich because of it. Because of that a lot of people would like to see him dead.  The Broker was so marvelous I believe that I would put it in the \\"tag along book\\" category. While I was reading this book it went with me everywhere. The bus, the bathtub, the dinner table, everywhere. The way Grisham writes keeps the reader in total suspense. For example, when Backman is in Italy you think he is going to spend the rest of his sorry little life there. But, Grisham has a bigger and better plan with lots of twists and turns that a reader wouldn't expect. Kudos to John Grisham for writing such a brilliant novel.    Anyone who loves technology and a good chase should really read this book. I believe any other book written by John Grisham would be a first-rate read.
B000FFJ81W|1.0|I doubted the review below that mentioned how bad the dual-disc is.  Shouldn't have.  I wasn't able to load the CD tracks onto either my home or work PCs.  And couldn't even play it on my CD player at home.  It took a Mac to actually read the files.  Bad news.  Should be recalled.
0316018953|5.0|With his latest offering, \\"The Overlook\\", Michael Connelly does not leave the reader wanting.  Harry Bosch is back where he belongs: investigating homicides.  Along with a new partner, Harry is called to the scene of an apparent \\"hit\\" on a victim.  When the victim is found to be the owner of a company that handles volatile materials that can potentially be used in creating dirty bombs, the stakes are raised.  As Harry delves deeper, he find obstacles in the way of the F.B.I. and his old flame Rachel Walling.  Harry races to solve the killing while balancing the spinning plate of National Security.  Connelly again demonstrates why he is the best crime fiction writer working.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I make a point of watching all Rickman's movies and this one delivers. Though not for the faint of heart, it's worth seeing.
B000068FXX|5.0|This is one of the best of the super seventies albums and a little-recognized classic.  Supertramp had a unique and instantly recognizable style that is very appealing if you like complex arrangements, solid but detailed melodies, all built around superb keyboard playing.  If all you know are the hits from \\"Breakfast in America\\", you really don't know Supertramp and probably dismiss them as a trivial band known for simple pop songs.  This CD will quickly dispell this notion and deserves repeated listening.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|As a longtime, diehard Rush fan I love the fact that Rush is never afraid of doing what they want musically. I've listened to it probably 40-50 times in both the Home and Car stereo. This album while Fresh and organic sounding (their goal, apparently to get back to a natural 3pc. band sound) suffers a little in the long run. It leaves me feeling there's something missing. Sonically its way better than Vapor Trails' hot, digital-clipping nightmare, but I think they went too \\"soft\\" this time fearing V.P's problems. Example: on this cd it sounds like all the instruments and vocals were recorded with the mic's about 6ft. away. Geddy's singing is very good and has a smooth delivery and Alex's guitar work is brilliant and wide-ranging throughout the cd. Neil's drumming is great, but not as inspiring as in the past. There is not a bad song in my opinion, but none (save The Main Monkey Business, Malnar, Faithless) have me hitting the repeat button often. Despite the buildup that this cd harkens back to the Rush 70's/80's heyday, I don't see that. To me it has more elements of Feedback,Vapor Trails, and My Favorite Headache in it than say Hemispheres, and Moving Pictures that some say. Also is anybody bothered by the sound of Neils drums? I've always loved the sound of his drums on EVERY album, but man either the recording or production makes it sound like he's hitting wet cardboard. It doesn't have that crisp, yet powerful sound and feel to it - maybe the \\"Natural\\" approach they were striving for. Oh well, I'll be there to see them in concert and wouldn't miss it for the world - Long Live Rush!!
0793518326|5.0|All in all, the book is pretty fantastic. Just like many others are saying, the print is a bit too small. I find that certain parts of the tabs are difficult to read, forcing me to assume that they couldn't fit and had to be written awkwardly. But is it still worth it? Of course it is. I haven't had this much fun in a while. What really amazes me is the simplicity of the songs. It goes to show that a good vocal melody can really carry a song into the heavens.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|Far Cry & Armor & Sword are good introductions to the album.  I didn't think this was too much of a departure from their original sound.  I know the producer stated that it would be a return to their 70's efforts, but this album sounded like business as usual for the trio.  Counterparts was a huge departure for them when they leaned toward \\"Power Trio\\"-type music (doing away with keys/synth).  Bands like Judas Priest & Iron Maiden have retained their overall sound... more like feel for their roots in music with little shifts/changes over time, which is what is happening here.  They didn't take a left turn & do a Megadeth or Rod Stewart album.  They simply stayed their course with a detour here & there to do some musical \\"sight-seeing\\".  This album isn't 2112 or Moving Pictures, but it wasn't meant to be.  It's the same quality product that will work itself nicely into the band's set lists in concert.
B000P2A256|1.0|This album wasn't all it's cracked up to be. I was thinking that they would sing less about break-ups with Jane and more about other life issues. If you are looking for a shitty remdition of their first album, please be my guest.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I've been a big DT fan since I seen them live in Ft Wayne, Ind. in the early 90's and they never stop ammazing me.  This disc is no different.  Their versitality of this band is unbelievable.  This is one of their hardest but best writen driving albums.  I was a little surprized with how hard it is but pleasantly surprized.  I might be partial to anything they come out with but I think this disc is one of many great ones they have.
B000PKG6TE|4.0|If the Queens do anything well it's evolving and progressing without completely changing there sound.  Josh Homme and the boys have moved away from the darker tones of Lullabies to Paralyze and have crafted an album in Era Vulgaris that jerks its way through fuzzed out guitars and somewhat more upbeat vocal harmonies.  That's not to say that other Queens of the Stone Age albums lacked harmony, it just seems to be more upfront on this album.  There seems to be more a glam rock element to this album as opposed to the grittier sound of there previous work.  There are still hard chunky guitar riffs here, but they seem much more danceable and less heart pounding.  Even the album cover seems brighter, with pink and purple colors all over the place.  The Queens haven't gone soft, they just appear to have returned to the hedonistic and celebratory rock of their second album Rated R.      The album opens with the best song on the album, Turnin on the Screw.  Turnin on the Screw is unlike any other song in their catalogue.  It's an easy rocker with reverb heavy guitars with Josh singing in a high register.  It throws the listener a curve ball because most Queens fans are programmed to expect their albums to start off with a bang.  The other high point is the Desert Sessions tune Make It Wit Chu.  Make It With Chu is a sleazy lounge song that seems almost effortless.  It's strange that I like the two slowest songs on the album best.  Maybe the next album will be full of easy going dirty lounge songs.      Most of the songs are good, but as a general complaint the rockers seem less interesting than on pervious albums.  All of the buzzy guitars seem to melt together in to a stew of noise.  Battery Acid is guilty of this as well as Misfit Love, I'm Designer, and Sick Sick Sick.  Repeated listens allow these songs to open up a bit, but they are not as rewarding as you'd expect.  The only true misstep is Into the Hollow.  With the plinky guitar at the start, it sounds like a b-sidefrom Lullabies.  It never really clicks like some of there other slower songs, it just seems to stagnate.      This album is recommended for fans of the band and anyone who wants to add a little hedonistic rock to their diet.  It's not as good as R, Songs for the Deaf, or Lullabies to Paralyze, but it's still a solid album that's easily on par with their self titled debut album.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is by far the best rendition of Pride and Prejudice. It may be long, but it is as true to the book as you can get.
B000PA9Q6E|5.0|They were only together for one album and tour, but the Hard Again band was the most kickass assemblage of blues talent there has ever been. They simply never played anything, either live or in studio, that was not of extraordinarily high quality. This disc absolutely smokes, and it's a welcome treat that Cotton and Winter each get a couple turns on lead vocals. It's very encouraging that there's still this much great stuff left over after after the two disc edition of Muddy \\"Mississippi\\" Waters, because that means there's likely more on the way.
B000INAXHE|5.0|Great listen-through. Funky to chilled and back again. Great continuity w/o being monotonous. Give a listen and you'll find Jamiroquai's best grooves are the ones that didn't get much air play. Good stuff.
0743455967|5.0|I learned more from this one book than all the other books on writing I've ever read. It's simple, insightful, direct, personal and entertaining.  Stephen King is truly a master of his craft.
B00020X88O|5.0|This film has the worst acting ever.  That's probably what makes it so entertaining to watch.  The costumes and the dancing are very entertaining and the plot is pretty ridiculous.  The VIP set is great with the shot glasses.  Definitely a movie you need to see at least once.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Like some people, I discovered Muse partly on accident. About two years ago I was listening to my usual radio station, Live 105 here in the SF Bay Area, when a song came on 'Time Is Running Out', one of the many good selections on this cd. After I heard that track, throughout the next few days more tracks of this CD played on the radio. I ended up buying this CD only two years ago, after I fell in love with their latest release, 'Black Holes And Revelations'.     But I will say this about Muse, yes, the lead singer sounds a little like Thom Yorke, but the overall sonic sound of Muse is nothing like Radiohead. Radiohead stuck to a narrow sound of BritPop. Muse on the other hand have really expanded the sound of what rock should sound like. Experimental, environmental, grand and symphonic. But if you really would like to get the full sound of Muse, I suggest you try and catch a Muse live show. I recently caught these guys when they came around to San Francisco. I was blown away at how great these guys are live. I hold the firm belief that Muse is one of best current live bands(aside from maybe The Arcade Fire) that not everyone has heard of.     In closing do yourself a favor, if you love rock music, get this CD(along with their other CDs), and go catch these guys live(if the show isn't sold out...)
0060887966|5.0|By far, the best piece...most insiring book, most creative, and most eloquent prose I have ever read.  When you are in a funk, going through life and the mundane daily routine and responsibilities, perhaps content, but not exactly fulfilled--this book is a blessing, and should be read.  The concept of the universe working in harmony with people and their quests in life, and the signs in which the universe reminds and reveals itelf to establish a path for our individual quest is brilliant and well-orchestrated throughout the book as a parable--almost biblical.  This is a refreshing diversion from the capitalistic, robotic nature of the times we live--work, work, and work...we live in a constant life of 'lists of things to do and things we have to buy,' and sometimes we forget and stop thinking that perhaps there is more to this universal plan.  For me, this book forced me to reflect on my life, and realize the 'signs' that were blantly, glaring at me, I never saw, because like the rest society, I was always too 'caught up.' I absolutely loved this book, and have bought at least ten copies for other people as gifts to assist and coerce them in finding there individual 'treasures.'  A MUST READ!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|As I said in my other review for their 'Absolution' CD, to really appreciate  Muse you have to see them live. This CD tends to go a little more experimental then 'Absolution' but the experiment pays off.     It really sounds like they really took a lot more influence in this CD, playing songs that sound like took some sonic lessons from Queen, Led Zeppelin, U2 among others. When Muse rocks, they rock hard. I have to say aside from my Arcade Fire CDs, this is one of the recently bought CDs that I have listened to front to back. I can't say that about a good majority of my CDs, let alone ones I have bought in the last two years. Let's go over the track list and my individual track ratings:     1. Take A Bow - (4/5)  2. Starlight - (5/5)(my second favorite track on this disc)  3. Supermassive Black Hole - (5/5)(My favorite track on this disc)  4. Map Of The Problematique - (5/5)  5. Soldier's Poem - (4/5)  6. Invincible - (5/5)   7. Assasin - (5/5)   8. Exo-Politics - (4/5)  9. City Of Delusion - (5/5)   10. Hoodoo - (4/5)   11. Knights Of Cydonia - (5/5)     So as you can see, I really, really enjoyed this disc. Again, Muse is one of the bands I sort of discovered by listening to the radio, I bought their CDs, then saw them live, and now I absolutely love Muse. If you love  your rock a little experimental, loud, soft and sonic all at the same time, get this CD, pickup the other Muse CDs, and by all means go see these guys live.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|Ok, so maybe the DVD isn't a complete reject. The footage of Neil at his ranch and that of the \\"Old Man\\" is just fabulous. Also, Neil on stage in that wonderful flannel shirt is precious. That being said, I can only watch a reel to reel tape recorder spinning around for just so long. Talk about space filling!   The CD part of this duo, however, is some of the finest early Neil available. I have a ton of bootleg LPs and nothing comes close to this. The sound quality and play list is outstanding. It's a real gem. Too bad that the packaging is so poor. The cheap cardboard sleeve will no doubt scratch the discs. Inside is a fragment of a newspaper review of the concert (man, I wish I had a time machine!) which the designers of this  CD/DVD package felt we would not be interest in reading. That's a shame.
B000MTPANQ|4.0|I bought the CD/DVD combination, because I was interested in seeing the concert.  Unfortunately, the video quality is spotty and for some of the songs there is no video at all, just a view of some instruments.    The audio quality is fine, and Neil sounds so young!  It's a joy to listen to...Enjoy.
B000BCE918|5.0|When the first Jurassic Park movie came out I fell in love with the brachiosaur \\"Welcome to Jurassic Park\\" scene and have been hooked ever since.  To have the three movies in a set and the additional footage is just a pleasure.  True the plot of the second movie (The Lost World) is not in the same league with  that first vision, but the dinosaurs are so great that it is still fun.  The third movie, however, is much closer to the first in quality and almost equally entertaining, thanks in part to the acting skills of William H. Macy.    It is the dinosaurs, however, that star in this trilogy. It is amazing to me how the well the special efffects have held up!  Definitely worth the cost of the DVDs.  Dinosaur lovers unite and ENJOY!
B000MRA5NS|3.0|I was very dissapointed when I saw this movie. Not because it is a bad movie it is actually a really well made movie, but because it isn't a good James Bond movie. It doesn't contain the witty dialect and sexual tension that we have come to expect and love from 007. And Craig, although attractive, doesn't posses the Bond charm or larger than life quality. So if your looking for a good shoot em' up movie this is a great movie for you, if you want \\"Bond, James Bond\\" go for the classics.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|\\"3s and 7s\\" is the best song Queens has ever written, hands down....if you are a true fan, then get this album now! If you're a fly-by-nighter, then put your hands back in your pants and sit indian style in the corner....no one likes you!! 3 words....creepy, heavy groove!!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|\\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" still comes across as fresh and entertaining almost 70 years after its release.  It was nominated for Best Picture in 1938.  Carl Jules Weyl won the Oscar for the film for Best Art Direction.  The delightful look of the Nottingham Palace with the high stone walls creates the perfect period atmosphere.  Ralph Dawson won the Oscar for Best Editing for the film.  Some of the film sequences are astonishing.  The scene where the whole hall breaks into sword fight has a continual clink of crashing swords as the camera shifts from duel to duel.  Erich Wolfgang's score won the other Oscar for which the picture was nominated.<br /><br />Errol Flynn's career is legendary as an action hero.  He was never nominated for an Oscar.  His personal life, particularly the statutory charges from 1942 that earned him the phrase \\"in like Flynn\\" could have wrecked a smaller star's career, but Flynn kept going.  He's probably in his quintessential moment as Robin Hood, flashing smiles, romantic sparks flying with Maid Marian and his constant good humor.  It's hard not to root for a hero like Robin.<br /><br />I particularly like Patric Knowles as his sidekick Will Scarlet.  From the costuming that places him in brilliant red to match his character name, Knowles flashes the smile, never stealing the spotlight, but always ready to fly to Robin's defense.  Knowles had a long film career that included some gems like \\"Expensive Husbands\\" & \\"A Bill of Divorcement,\\" but he shined brightly in this action adventure.<br /><br />Olivia deHaviland plays Marian Fitzwalter, better known as Maid Marian.  The costumer highlights her face in blues & lavenders.  She radiates incredible charm & grace.  The scene where she stands before Prince John and declares her disgust with his actions shows steel in her her feminine character.  Olivia won two Oscars for \\"To Each His Own\\" in 1946 & \\"The Heiress\\" in 1949.  Her role as Marian was believable.  Her loving looks let you know that Robin was one lucky man.<br /><br />Eugene Pallette plays Friar Tuck.  This actor had an amazing career, acting in over 180 films!  His resume lists some true classics like 1916's \\"Intolerance,\\" the ghostly \\"Topper\\" from 1937, \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\" in 1939 & \\"Heaven Can Wait\\" in 1943.  As the portly Friar Tuck, his swordfight scene with Robin is both entertaining and hilarious.  He had a voice that sounded like a gravel road, but he was one of the actors that flourished in both the silent and sound eras.<br /><br />Alan Hale Sr. who played Little John also had an amazing film career spanning from 1912 to 1950.  His films include silent era \\"The Prisoner of Zenda\\" from 1913 to \\"The Inspector General\\" in 1949.  As Little John, his burly build and contagious good humor makes him an ideal fit for Robin's band of Merry Men.<br /><br />Our two main villains are both played by notable actors.  As Prince John, Claude Rains is an underhanded two-faced back-stabber.  He was nominated four times as Best Supporting Actor including for \\"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington\\" in 1939 & \\"Casablanca\\" in 1943.<br /><br />Basil Rathbone who many associate as Sherlock Holmes plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne and vows to apprehend Robin Hood.  The scene where Robin captures his entourage, takes his money & sends him back in rags is (for the audience) a joyful humiliation.  Rathbone was nominated for Best Supporting actor in [[ASIN:1428016988 If I Were King]], a film based on the stage play by Justin Huntly McCarthy.  He had also been nominated for a similar award in 1936 for \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\"  Neither Raines nor Rathbone ever won an Oscar, as good as they both were.<br /><br />Two other actors deserve special mention.  Ian Hunter played Richard the Lionheart who returns home in the nick of time to reclaim his throne.  Hunter won an Oscar in 1953 for Best Original Screenplay for \\"Roman Holiday.\\"  Una O'Connor plays Lady Marian's attending maid Bess.  Her clever comic barbs made her screen time sparkle.  O'Connor was in many other films including \\"The Bells of St. Mary's\\" from 1945 & \\"Random Harvest\\" in 1942.  Some may also be interested to note that the palomino horse Olivia deHaviland rides in Sherwood Forest later would be seen as Roy Rogers' Trigger.<br /><br />The theme of Saxons and Normans getting along despite differences, the treatment of women, fairness in taxation and care for the poor give the film a thematic backbone.  As we near the 70th anniversary of this film, it deserves its place as one of the most watched & loved of the era's movies.  Enjoy!lls of St. Mary's\\" from 1945 & \\"Random Harvest\\" in 1942.

B00000JBFW|5.0|Perfect Strangers is the perfect CD.  There is not a single track that I skip over on this CD and that is rare for me.  The entire CD is classic.   The sound is superb, the musicianship is tight and the CD simply rocks.  If you like classic rock, get your hands on this CD.  It will be worth it to  you and you will have a hard time taking it out of the CD player.    Rock on
B000NA28I4|2.0|I have to agree with a lot of the reviews that have been written.  This is a poor production of the book.  If you want to enjoy this movie, watch it before reading the book.  After you read the book, you be thinking about all of the stuff that was left out and how they changed the story.  Its pace is too fast and you don't get any real character and relationship development.      I am planning on getting rid of the copy I own and will not see any following movies, if they make them.
B000P0J024|5.0|I bought the Traveling Wilburys when it first came out back in 1988. At the time I always enjoyed the album but did not appreciate what a masterpiece it really is.  When you take 5 musicians of this calibur, two things will happen. The will get together and sell a million copies on their names, or they will make a great album. Fortunately the latter applies.  George Harrison was the main force behind this effort, but everyone contributed.  Now that Orbison and Harrison have passed the CD, means even more to us.  They purposely sat down and went back to basic Rock and Roll, 60's style and really came up with something.  I was elated to see it be released once again.   Highlighs include..Handle with Care, Last Night, The End of the Line and She's my Baby along with the Wilbury Twist......Thank God they got together to do this.........  The DVD also talks about how Harrison went about forming the group and how they wrote songs together on acoustic guitars.  What is amazing is how they did this in such a short time...................File this under \\"C\\" for Classic
B000JLTRKE|3.0|This movie traces the story of two Port Authority Policemen, played by Nicholas Cage and Michael Pena, who attempt to rescue survivors of 9/11 at the World Trade Center.  After they enter the building, it collapses and they are trapped in the rubble.  They talk to each other to keep up their courage, but it is evident that they are badly injured.  The movie shows flashbacks of the men and their families and also shows the agony their wives are going through as they wait for word of their husbands.    The script never properly develops the two main characters in the viewer's mind and this detracts from the overall emotional impact which the movie could have had.  However, the movie does have merit and it serves as a tribute to those who risked and lost their lives in this tragedy.
0316067598|5.0|The book details the actions of 4 incredibly brave young men on the ground led by Navy SEAL Lt. Michael P. Murphy and the story of 8 other SEALs who jumped to the forefront to get their gun into the fight. Kudos to all these brave young Americans who show there are things worth fighting and dying for. We should honor them all as a grateful nation.
B000008LOV|5.0|Wow, I must really be getting old, because I remember buying this album in high school and enjoying every single track on it. Over the years I have bought and sold a lot of CDs, but I've never even thought about selling this one. Not only that, but I still listen to it frequently (though of course now it's on my ipod - gotta keep up with the times after all). Unlike some \\"all-star\\" albums, this one isn't an ego fest. No one artist tries to outdo the others or steal the show. Instead, it's as if these five remarkably talented musicians just sat around having fun in the studio and ended up with some great music. I've never heard anything else that sounds like the Traveling Wilburys' unique and original style.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|This is, by far, the best nature film ever made. The picture they recorded make you appreciate this earth more than ever, all in crystal clear HD so clear it almost like you are looking out the window.  You cannot help but watch.    One minor point: This is the British version. Thus, somethings are given in meters, not feet or inches.  Just remember, a meter is roughly 3.5 feet.
B00005LMBK|5.0|Then again, it's a lot more than either punk or hip-hop can fully cover. It is basically everything you have ever heard, but reimagined in a completely different way. Every track on here is great, and not just good, which is something the I can't say for most CDs, including the Gorillaz' own Demon Days album.    The first Gorillaz CD is to Gorillaz as Nevermind was to Nirvana. It is the timeless classic that can be listened to over and over again without a likely chance of growing tired of it. While this CD is less of an acquired taste than the first CD is, and is still very good, it's not as good.    Danger Mouse pales in comparison to Dan the Automater's producing skills in the first work. The reason for this is in the variety. Danger Mouse has set a tone that plays throughout the CD, with each and every track. Dan the Automater on the other hand, delivered a CD with so much variety there would have to be something for everyone. Whereas CD 1 covered the broad range of reggae, Latin, punk, pop, rock, dance, rap, hip-hop, DJ, ska, and just about every type of music available, this CD sticks its feet in firm territory and never moves.    CD 1 is for the music in general lover, CD 2 is for those like the one particular sound that can be heard in most of the Gorillaz more recent videos. If you had to choose between the two, I'd go with CD 1 first, and then maybe get CD 2 later, when you get the chance.    Just make sure CD 1 comes with Dracula, Suzuki Left Hand Method, and the Clint Eastwood/19-2000 remixes as well... as most of original Gorillaz albums these days should have. You wanna get the most for your money after all.

0316548189|5.0|I had always heard that Nelson Mandela was a living legend, yet I knew so little about him. This book confirmed the legend.     The book takes you through the journey of his life. From his upbringing, to his entering the political life, his 27 years in prison and finally his return from prison to lead the nation. It is very interesting to read his rationale and thought process behind every decision, personal or political. He was a strong-willed man with an exceptionally strong sense of what is right and wrong. He spent 27 years in jail without ever applying for an appeal and rejecting every offer of release. He never lost his resolve even in the most trying of times. He believed that equality and freedom are every human's birthright and he was willing to die for the freedom of his people. The book has countless lessons not only for political leaders who lead nations but for common people for their day to day lives.    A must read for everybody. I would highly recommend it.
0446691437|5.0|If you're anything like me, you know you should be sitting down and writing instead of just surfing the net, checking email (though writing email messages may count as writing), looking out the window, taking out the trash, washing the car, and whatever else follows this pattern.    When you get back in (after a day filled with other created things to do), you have this feeling that you got nothing done with what you were meant to write.    Well, this book will help you break that pattern. But it does take a bit of work. In his book, Steven Pressfield talks of the many ways we keep ourselves from doing what we know we should be doing. He talks of the evil that is resistance and how to sit down and battle it by being professional.    It is a quick read. My suggestion is read it through the first time in a single sitting. Then, the next day, go back to it and study it, gain ideas that get your attention, that you truly believe can work (and even a few you may wonder about). It is well worth the price.

B000E8NQU4|4.0|I just received this Deluxe 2 CD set from a reputable seller, but there is no mention  of it being a Hybrid SACD anywhere in the package. The sound is excellent, but if  you want the  H-SACD version you might want to inquire with the seller first.  The editorial review above states that this set is from Polydor.

B000N6U0E2|5.0|Great move! I am glad to have it as part of my collection.
B00012FXAE|5.0|If you're not the type to run out and replace your VCR collection as soon as the new format arrives, you probably appreciate a slightly clever ploy to spring for a new version of a classic. An additional 17 minutes of film may seem little justification for this expensive proposition. But seeing the slimey xenomorphs on DVD is reward enough for a fan. The discs include the theatrical release and the director's cut along with other extras, which include an interview with director James Cameron. Cameron dwells excessively on his strained patience dealing with a British film crew. His comments may reveal insight into Cameron's choice to forgo taking the director's seat for the third film (which received some critical acclaim but disappointed fans).     I originally screened Aliens in the theater in July 1986. I remember watching the credits roll with the powerful soundtrack that kept the heart pounding as the last of the text disappeared. Even with the lights coming up, the sound of a slithering alien sent chills down my spine. Sadly, this part of the track is missing from this set.    Successive viewings have not spoiled enjoyment of this finely crafted script and its special effects. Rubber suits, scale models and puppetry have never been used to such great effect. The scenes involving the \\"drop ship\\" are stunning. The breathless sequence that takes the drop ship from the mother ship to the planet's surface is but one of many that make this nightmare so real.    Few pauses and a lot of action pace this relentless story. Cameron's decision to write Marines into the confrontation was nothing shy of genius. The Marines think they're heading to a \\"bug hunt.\\" Bill Paxton's Hudson, who provides comedic relief, describes the array of weaponry they bring. But for all the techno gadetry and fire power, the Marines find themselves stranded amid an army of aliens intent on making them hosts for more bugs. Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, whom we didn't know was a parent from the original release, provides a first-rate performance in the escape ahead of the massing aliens.     Cameron's tip of the hat to Hitchcock is one the best moments in cinematic history. The confrontation in the bowels of the disintegrating atmosphere generating plant is as disturbing as anything science fiction has to offer. Not since Hitchcock's \\"The Birds\\" has there been anything like it. And, there's more. The final battle with the queen alien is a masterpiece of action filming. Not until the survivors are snuggly tucked into their cryotubes, do we finally get to gasp a sigh of relief.
0399246665|5.0|When they are very little they want to handle it, gum it, chew on it, etc.  Eric Carle is brilliant and putting his work onto such approachable material was the RIGHT thing to do.

B000P0J024|4.0|This is really an excellent collection and an essential purchase even for those who may already own the original Traveling Wilburys albums. The remastering job is excellent and the discs sound great. Volume 1, of course, is the better of the two, but Volume 3 features several great songs. However, both albums suffer at times from Lynne's 80's production, which almost ruins \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man.\\" Don't get me wrong, though, both of these albums are such fun to listen and probably the best rock star side project ever.<br /><br />The bonus material is all excellent and worthy of inclusion. The bonus tracks on Vol. 1 are especially great - Harrison's \\"Maxine,\\" which should have made the album, and Dylan's \\"Like a Ship,\\" a solid entry in his 80's output. The bonus tracks on Vol. 3 are two covers, but fun to listen to - their version of \\"Runaway\\" is very solid, it even reproduces the organ solo of the original!<br /><br />The DVD is surprisingly indispensable, consisting of original footage from the recording of the first album and all five videos from the Wilburys. As home video, the recording footage is as good quality as can be expected, and you get to see the Wilburys actually writing the songs and recording them. One of the best moments is seeing Dylan recording his vocals for \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\" - how often do you get to see Bobby D. at work in the studio?<br /><br />Basically, then, this is a fantastic reissue of two very good albums, and the bonus materials all add to the experience. I'm not sure what you get with the deluxe edition, but I think it is really just fancier packaging and a larger booklet, which appeals mainly to the collector. For the average fan, this set is the best way to go- it's cheaper and you get all the audio and video that comes with the pricier edition, just less luxe I guess.
1577312082|5.0|I heard about this book from Marc Allen, the producer of this book/CD.  In one of Marc's CDs he mentions it and it sounded intriguing to me but I was sure that I had heard it all before.  I am an avid spiritual book reader and lately they have all started blending into the same book; a sort of amalgam of new age books!  It took me a while to order this CD but I did finally order it and I am so glad that I did!  This honestly is the most influential book I have ever read.  Some of the things that Eckhart talks about were actually new to me!  How refreshing is that!!  This book finally answered some of the unanswered questions that I have had about life and I also found out why those typical \\"new-agers, love this, and love that\\" seem to bother me.  I found out not why I do things, I found out that I don't need to know why!  I no longer need to analyze things - I can just be there.  It's a real freedom now.  I'm not totally there yet but I have started to get glimpses of true freedom and peace.  I finally figured out how to connect with my true self.  This book is the catalyst that will bring you, not to a new level, but to THE level.      I have a hard time recommending this book to others however only because the topics in the book are pretty new - even to a new age person.  I actually laughed quite a few times while listening to this book partly because of how he structured the book.  He taught people these ideas in person but was asked question upon question upon question by the people he was teaching and in doing so he liked that format and that's how his book is structured.  He puts a question out there and then answers it.  Some of the questions are hilarious and I can really see some of these \\"new-agers, everything is OK and I love everyone\\" type people asking these questions.  These types of people may or may not get this book.  Eckhart teaches that there isn't an OK - there is just the beauty of the moment.  If you are, as Eckhart says, \\"present\\" then you won't have to say \\"It's OK\\" or \\"I love everyone\\" because you will actually LIVE that now.    If I had to throw out all of my spiritual texts, CDs, DVDs, and everything else spiritual except for one thing, I would keep this book.  If everyone would read this book the death of the world as we know it would happen and a new birth would occur.  The new birth would be the awakening of this world.  Even though I have a hard time recommending this book to people, this is the one book that will probably save this world and as such everyone should probably read it.
B000OVLBEY|4.0|A guy that turns into a firy skeleton at night because he made a deal with the devil.  I like this movie.  I liked that Sam Elliot was in it.  I liked Nicholas Cage.  If you are a fan of Ghost Rider you should get this!
0393061434|5.0|Great book, and writing style.  I found it compelled me to continue to read, almost as though Woz was sitting in the room, telling the stories himself.  I would highly recommend this for anyone that is interested in a positive \\"insider's look\\" at the early days of Silicon Valley.
0793518326|4.0|These scores are a great starting point for my own arrangements for string quartets and orchestras. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, there definitely are mistakes (for example, bass line is wrong in She's Leaving Home), and to catch these you have to listen to the recording with the score open, a somewhat time-consuming process.
B000OVLBF8|5.0|Ghost Rider is a fun ride.  The computer generated images are excellent.  Nicolas Cage delivers the lines with his usual quirky, over-the-top enthusiasm (or lack thereof).  His chemistry onscreen with Eva Mendes is believable and makes the story work quite well.<br /><br />I knew very little about the comic book character Ghost Rider before seeing this movie, so I enjoyed not comparing the storyline to any preconceived notion of what I thought this film should be.  I was simply along for the ride.<br /><br />What makes this movie so enjoyable is that I kept picturing Nicolas Cage reading the script and saying, \\"Wow, I'm going to have fun playing this guy!\\"  And that's the way it seemed throughout the whole movie.  Whether it was an \\"extra\\" in the background, staring at the Ghost Rider's fiery trail, or one of the headlining actors in the film, I could see that \\"this is a fun movie to be involved with\\" look in their eyes.<br /><br />Johnny Blaze has his work cut out for him:  Save the girl; figure out exactly who he has become; analyze his powers and figure out what works and what doesn't; and deal with the authorities chasing him down every time he's trying to get rid of some spirit-world bad guys.  The action scenes, whether Johnny is riding his mortal-cycle or immortal-cycle, look really good.  I never found myself saying, \\"Awe, c'mon, that looked way too fake.\\"  And unlike \\"The Hulk\\" movie, the scenes were shot with lighting that actually allowed the fighting to be seen instead of covered over by shades of black.<br /><br />Raquel Alessi, who plays the young Roxanne Simpson (Eva Mendes' character in the movie), looks uncannily like Mendes.  This really adds to the overall realism of the movie.  I think it was a little harder to find a young actor who looks anything like a young Nicolas Cage, so that transition was more difficult to pull off.<br /><br />I was happy with the way this movie wasn't afraid to show the real difference between good and evil, innocent and guilty, love and hate.<br /><br />Peter Fonda makes a great devil.  Not sure if that's a compliment, but I just had to throw that in.  He delivered some of the silliest lines in the movie, but somehow manages to make them work.  Now that's good acting.  Watching Fonda in this film made me want to run out and rent some of his other films (like Easy Rider).<br /><br />So, to sum up my review:  Ghost Rider manages to deliver a good solid script, some talented actors and actresses, really good special effects, suspense, drama, and action.  Ignore the naysayers and give this movie a shot.  I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />See ya next review!ter Fonda makes a great devil.

078401213X|1.0|I'm gonna go out on a limb here...  This is pretty much the worst video ever made.  People say, \\"Like anyone can even know that, you didn't give it a chance, you didn't get it.\\"  No, no, and no.  I would rather watch Uncle Rico throw a football and talk about how he could have won state.           I gave it a chance, and I tried to \\"get it.\\"  The first time I watched it, I thought it was awful, but I thought there might be something more to it.  (No, No!  There's less.)  I became obsessed with trying to find a meaning, then I became obsessed with trying to find a single redeeming quality in the movie.  There is none.           Save yourself the 84 mins of your life.  Go watch the grass grow.  Actually, it's not even as fun as watching the grass grow, it's more like watching a rock be a rock.  You can't reason with me... this movie sucks.  I'd rather watch the video from \\"The Ring.\\"
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This is the best way to experience the RHCP.  They started out as  performance artists and do their best work in front of a live audience. Their live cd is also a must have.  The quality of the photography makes it all the more better to watch these beautiful performers do their thing.  From Anthony's tireless dancing vocals to John's sexy guitar strumming, your eyes get a feast.  Chad never falters as his engine keeps the team moving along so Flea can be the zany bass player he is.  Don't miss this masterpiece.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|Despite the many negative noses being turned towards Ghost Rider, for a majority of it's running time, the film is a goofy and surprisingly enjoyable comic book blast that remains surprisingly faithful to it's source material.  Avid comic fan Nicolas Cage plays Johnny Blaze, a stunt biker who years before had struck a deal with the devil Mephisto (Peter Fonda) to save the life of his cancer stricken father, and all he had to give up was his soul.  Naturally, no one ever gets away from making a deal with the devil, and Blaze pays the price for his deal when Mephisto's son Blackheart (Wes Bentley) comes with apocalyptic intentions.  Chances are, you already know the rest of the story from this point forward, so I won't waste anymore time in that department.  What makes Ghost Rider enjoyable is that the film doesn't take itself too seriously, and Cage is enjoyably goofy (if slightly annoying) as Johnny Blaze (who personally I always thought was a role tailor made for Kurt Russell, but hey, what do I know?).  Sam Elliot is on board as well as the Caretaker, who is pitch perfect casting, with the only weak points being the overacting Bentley as Blackheart, and Eva Mendes as Blaze's love interest Roxanne.  Mark Steven Johnson, who brought Daredevil to the screen in 2003, fares much better with the material here, and the rampant CGI effects are mostly well done to boot.  For everything it had going against it, Ghost Rider is surprisingly enjoyable, and as long as you don't expect much from it, you'll probably get a kick out of it.
B000002LQR|4.0|What I like best about this album is that you get a peak of their past funk style and their jump over the threshold into rock.  It has every element of their many layered canvas.  No band is more honest or true to themselves as this band.  Although 'Under the Bridge' became their signature song at the time, it pays to listen to every song before this classic. Anything after Naked in the Rain, which follows UTB is a bit more graphic and may need to be monitored for younger audiences.  My favorite is the funky rock tune, Righteous and the Wicked which proceeds immediately to the best version (studio versus live) of 'Give it Away'.  You will not be sorry.  Any new RHCP fan must appreciate their past to love their present.
0141439831|5.0|The book is really good, even though it is really long, it is not boring. So many characters and things going on. And it still surprises me after all those years relationships have still the same tricks. The human physiology never changes.

B000067J1H|5.0|Fight Club is a crude raunchy slugfest that knocks the wind out of you like an unsuspecting kick to the balls. Edward Norton a mealy mouthed insurance inspector runs into his antihero, a wise smart mouth punk, who knows what ails today's men. They have lost their animal instinct, the bloodlust, and their will to survive. The two start up a clandestine bare knuckle fight club. Surprisingly clubs spring up everywhere. The members begin to worship Pitt and Norton like gods. Things take a turn for the worse as the fight clubs turn its energy on society. Norton slowly but surely begins to realize that there is something really familiar about Pitt. This is really a great film if you're planning to be part of the new revolution; of course we all know the first rule.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I watched this movie for the first time while surfing through my HD Channels.  But I'll admit that I wasn't interested in watching this movie when it was first released or any other time it was available on premium channels.  However, more recently I have become more intrigued by Brad Pitt and it's probably because of all the current media hype he's recently received as half of the hottest Hollywood couple.  Aside from wanting to see more of Brad and his acting, the picture quality was quite amazing and enough to get me into the movie.  Each scene was like still life photography.  From the rooms of the Parrish mansion to the boardroom, the color and tone of the set was just beautiful.  Even some of the elements such as the cake samples were unique and colorful and lend such timelessness to this film.  Although the sound editing put me and my remote to work with its highs (Music) and lows (Voice), the video quality fared much better as HD made for some wonderful viewing, especially of Brad.  The early scene of Brad's freak pedestrian accident was so unfortunate, but convincing enough to link him to his Death character.  I anticipated every scene and found some scenes and acting a bit quirky (peanut butter), while other scenes, particularly the intimate one, simply enthralling.  Needless to say, I became a willing hostage up to the party scene, at which time I had to pull myself away for another urgent commitment.  However, I will have to savor the rest and probably the best parts of the film for when I purchase the DVD.  I really look forward to viewing it again from beginning and to the very end.
B00005N5RM|4.0|This is a great 80s horror movie, it's fun and the 95min run time flies by.  Filled with good fx, comedy, and action.  This movie was also in Fangoria's 101 best horror movies you've never seen book sold by Amazon. (i should get a free dvd for that plug)  So, the plot, A meteor (or is it!)crashes to earth jellylike goo busts out of so called meteor, this goo slithers through anything and attaches itself to humans devouring these humans and getting bigger and bigger.  A loner rebel (Or is he!) named Brian Flagg (Almost as scary as the blob is his mullet) played by Kevin Dillon (entourage, platoon) teams up with hot cheerleader Meg Penny to lead the fight against the BLOB!   This movie also wasn't as predictable as i thought *SPOILER ALERT*, earlier in the movie a nice waitress Fran gets asked out by equally nice and fair  Sheriff Herb Geller.  Fran declines cause she has to work , but wait leaves a note on the check \\"i get out at 11\\" oooh i can't wait.  So this is the making of something beautiful right, nope the blob squashes Fran in a telephone booth, and guess who she sees right before this squashing Sheriff Herb, does he blow a kiss goodbye?  Negative he is up in the blob that is about to devour her.  At least they do become one.  Even before Meg Penny goes on her date with responsible and likeable Paul.  He meets her dad and her mom, he's an established character from the beginning, so he makes it right? Wrong again, blob food.  I knew he was a goner when at the hospital rebel loner Brian Flagg shows his soft side to the bumb and Meg was swooning, it was all over for football player Paul Taylor at that point.  Finally the nice priest who makes teens buying condoms at the pharmacy guilty, gets attacked by goo.  I know what your saying, stop it, not the priest .... No, the priest makes it but is that a good thing or a bad thing ..duh duh duh!!!  This movie was a blast.  So, if you collect dvds, horror, or 80s movies this is a nice add to your collection, it had mewanting to peg my pants, wear skidz, some old air jordans, and shave some lines in my head.  It's also a great remake up there with dawn of the dead (2004) and cat people(1982), i can't think of any others off the top of my head.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|Well.. many have waxed their love or hate for the new album \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" with not much going on in the middle. It is interesting that either the whole thing sucks or the whole thing rules.     I will not go into each song and rip this part or that part. That is for each of us to decide on our own. My focus is more on the overall success, or failure in this case, to produce an album that is sonic and dynamic, melodic and worth being called a Rush record. I have many points to focus on and will do my best to explain my views on each subject.    1) Rush needs a producer that is more concerned with making a great RUSH record than making a name for himself. Just because some hot shot may have had success with other bands(Foo Fighters and Velvet Revolver)doesn't mean they have a CLUE how to do a great Rush record. There are countless times when a band grabbed the \\"new guy\\" only to have their sound ruined by that new producer! Ted Nugent was convinced by the \\"new guy' in the early 1980's to stop playing the Birdland and use a different sound. It set his career back 10 or more years. He plays it now ...and wow,he sounds like TED!! Rush should produce themselves or at least get a proven classic rock producer and start there...Martin Birch, Ted Templeton, Bob Rock, or,hey how about that Terry Brown guy!!!    2) The material lacks any solid melody and that was always what made Rush so incredible. They could still be chops all over the place and still leave you humming SOMETHING! Hell you can even hum to Cyngus X-1!! They don't even sound like songs. And can we PLEASE try a different tempo just once in a while?? Please?? They are just pieces throw together without any glue. And of course without glue...nothing sticks!    3) Geddy's vocals are awful. WHAT IS WITH ALL THE DOUBLE TRACKING??? STOP IT!! I don't need or want backing vocals on a Rush record! Leave that to the Simpson sisters! Can you imagine what Tom Sawyer would have sounded like with that crappy production ....OUCH!    4)As a drummer of 35+ years, I have to do this. Neil...you messed up! I go all the way back to the period between Counterparts and Test for Echo..you know...the \\"reinvention of Neil Peart\\". Well congrats...you did that alright...you created a drummer that is nothing like the one we loved before the \\"reinvention\\". All the things that made Neil the legend he is..the power, the discipline, and the amazing ability to play the same parts again and again has been replaced by a boring and uninspired drummer who lacks focus and power. Gone are the flashy toms runs, the \\"tool box\\" has shrunk to a shadow of what it once was. YOU DON'T EVEN PLAY THE SAME FILLS ANYMORE AND THAT IS UNFORGIVEABLE! I don't want new fills in Limelight, or Passage to Bangkok!! PLAY THE RIGHT PARTS...we all know them..we expect them...Geddy can't just change the lyrics to Freewill....nor should you with the drum parts. They were just as important as the chord changes...that is what made you the PROFESSOR!! This powerful..precise...creative and amazing player. I miss that part of Rush the most!!    5)The band lacks the Rush sound that we all used to take for granted. Even when they added key and syns..the drums, bass and guitar were right there...in your face...clear, focused, and in it's own place. Now, the band is muddy, sluggish and lacking in color. Neil maybe playing away but it is so stuck in the mix that there is no impact...no UMPH if you will. I have never seen a band get WORSE with each recording, in regards to their sound, as I have seen with Rush. I would have NEVER expected that ever!     So regardless of the lyrics, or the parts played or the musicianship, which is STILL top notch...nothing was going to save this record if it was going to be recorded as it was, mixed the way it was and produced the way it was. No material...no matter how good or bad will ever sound good if you face the problems I just listed. But I bet they sound 100% better live...and that is the biggest shame of all....they are capable...if they made better choices...    peace

B00007AJF9|3.0|The movie gets 4 stars for entertainment value. It, however, is a historical piece, and as one that would be so widely viewed, they should have used less 'artistic license' for what was already a fascinating period. The aesthetic qualities of the film are excellent, no doubt, but often foray into some Vegas-style midieval fantasy. Kate Blanchett is a decent Elizabeth, but can not even come close to Glenda Jackson's spellbinding portrayal. Geoffrey Rush as Walshingham is good, but exaggerated. The rest of the cast is so laughably inaccurate, especially the Duc d'Anjou, Dudley and Cecil.<br /><br />Best way to watch this movie...clear your mind of any notion that the characters portrayed were in any way real historical figures!
B0008KLVCS|4.0|This was not as gory as I had been led to expect. The twists ARE NOT as predictable as most people think. No.. you don't really see the ending coming.<br />This is a psychological thriller and it's very good. Well done. There were discrepancies like someone having flash backs to someone else's memories. And some people acting pretty much annoying and the excuses for acting out of the very character templates are rather weak. A cop stays a cop. And if he's watching someone leave a building, he should have noticed when someone went in - or more specifically that he missed it when they went in and had an alarm go off in his head.<br />Characters are engines to further a plot but they need to be more or you end up with GhostShip where frankly you don't even bother remembering anyone's name - you already know their parts and purposes.<br /><br />I will definately get the next one. This movie was such a pleasant surprise!

B000OVLBEO|5.0|This is simply one of the 2 or 3 best comic book movirs ever made!! Nick Cage is a great actor. He pulls out all the stops here, and you can see why he is an Oscar winner. Sam Elliott is once again perfect as a mysterious western iconic hero. The CGI special effects are very well done, with almost none of yhat cheesy \\"I'm watching a cartoon\\" feel of some other superhero flicks (see \\"Spider-Man\\"). The scene in which the Sam Elliott Ghost Rider from the old west rides with the Nick Cage Ghost Rider sent chills down my spine. I just wish Elliott's Ghost Rider could have played a part in the final climactic battle (riding in to save the day, as all the great old cowboys did). The bikes & stunts were awesome, and Peter Fonda as the Devil payed homage to his classic \\"Easy Rider\\" role (too bad Jack Nicholson did not make a cameo).The atmosphere & sets had an almost Sergio Leone feel to them, especially the Biker Bar.I actually hope there is no \\"Ghost Rider II\\", because this one ended perfectly, and there is nothing more to add. See this film, and watch it again, you won't be disappointed!
B00000K19E|5.0|It is the movie that set new standards in the world of movie making.  Terminator 2 did it in 1990, and the Matrix took it to the next level in 1999.  Other films, such as Romeo Must Die, have tried to duplicate these wonderful effects, but have come up short.  Not only is the Matrix a first in superb visuals and animation, but it is a dang good movie too.<br /><br />If you haven't heard of the Matrix yet, this first installment explains everything.  It might take a few viewings to understand every nook, but once it all fits into place it is a great theme, \\"is this world we live in real, or not, and what exactly defines \\"real\\".  The Matrix will explain it all, in the eyes of Neo (aka Mr. Anderson as Agen Smith likes to call him), from his simple days as another man in the Matrix to becoming unplugged and becoming \\"The One\\".<br /><br />The story is great.  The characters are top notch and the visuals are to die for.  Many even place this movie into martial arts category, as each fight scene displays true martial arts choreogrpahy intertwined with visual effects of animation.  Truly though, the Matrix is a sc-fi action blast.  Although there is the R rating, I have seen PG-13 films with more questionable content that this film.  Most teenagers and above should be suitable for this.<br /><br />Arguably the best in the trilogy, The Matrix is in my opinion that compared to the other two.  Be sure to watch Reloaded and Revolutions, though not as good in story, the visuals are simplying mind-blowing, only expanding on what the first installment created.
B00005JPMX|5.0|2007 marked my 20th year as a TMNT fan i was 9 when the last film came out so here we are 14 years later am 23 years old and the long awaited 4th movie was worth the wait. So the gose like this the turtles have gone there own ways leonardo has gone to south americain rain forests and been there for 2 years donatello is running a I.T. helpline michelangelo entertains kids at there birthday partys as cowabunga carl and raphael...well thats for you to find out whoever is reading this. the whole movie is a CG cartoon this time insted of it being a live action film like the last 3 movies the story is ture to the comic book roots witch is a good thing the voice acting at first i was not sure about the new voice actors doing the voices of the turtles because if the voice acting sucks then it ruins the movie in my view but am happy to say they did a good job and suport from chris evans sarah michelle gellar kevin smith patrick stewart ziyi zhang and the late mako who died last year made the voice acting good my best bit of the film was fight between leo and raph the face off between them two was a long time comming. so in short if your a TMNT fan like me and has been waiting a long time for the 4th chapter like me then your going to love this if your not a fan check it out anyway and i dare to say film of the year bring on the next one because they are back and they are here to stay.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Toughness and physicality stand out more than anything in the 22nd James Bond movie, thanks to the new Bond character played by Daniel Craig.  His physical appearance is tougher than any previous Bond, and that adds to the terrific and exciting action in Casino Royale.  His on screen presence, action or not, is always solid and he has a way of easily drawing in the interest of the audience.  His acting is just great, and I don't think you could find another Bond replacement anywhere else.  I have no doubt that the Bond franchise will continue because of this man, and Casino Royale has become one of the most popular of all the Bond movies ever made.<br /><br />While Daniel Craig is the strongest element that made this movie work, Casino Royale is actually a wonderful film in its own.  The story and plot are very well told and very interesting, told in the Bond tradition with the refreshness of a modern film rolled in.  The action is simply amazing.  Only 2 big action scenes but they are intense and again, more physical than any previous Bond film.  I don't mean fights, but more like stunts and quickness you would see in a Jackie Chan movie.  The other characters are wonderful too, especially the villain, Le Cheffre.  The man is not a physical challenge for Bond, but an intelligent one.  He carries a nasty scar over his fake left eye that speaks villain for itself.  The Bond girl in this movie is different than one would expect from previous Bond movies.  There is actually an emotional attachment between her and Bond, and we get to see what becomes of Bond's trust towards women after Casino Royale.<br /><br />The run time felt a bit long, nearly 2-1/2 hours.  The intensity slows way down at the end, but picks up with an ending I admit I did not see coming, and very important story for the future of Bond.  I loved the beginning of the film, which creates a unique beginning for the famous \\"Bond walk, stop, aim and shoot - seen through the eye of the enemy's gun\\" you see before every Bond movie.  The title credits and theme song \\"You Know My Name\\" were unique yet fit very well.  Bond locations have come back in Casino Royale, where as in some of the latter Brosnan movies, exotic locations were become nothing more than the inside of a studio.  Casino Royale takes place in Madagascar, Bahamas, Miami, and Montenegro.<br /><br />Bond fan or not, you will love this film.  It is everything a good classic Bond film has and what a film for today needs.  Yes, Bond seems to be coming back to its roots in this one.  Casino Royale is arguably one of the best Bond movies made and Daniel Craig might just give the original Sean Connery some competition.<br /><br />Acting - 4.5<br />Action - 4.5<br />Charcaters - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.5nd movie.

B000M06K5C|5.0|I saw this band on Late Night with Conan O'Brian and I was very impressed with their live performance of \\"The Prayer.\\" The singer was Black, but his style was somewhere between, Robert Smith, of The Cure, and Feli Kuti, the Nigerian singer and Afrobeat band leader. Turns out the band was fronted by Nigerian-born singer Kele Okereke. The rest of the band looked like a lot of post-punk limey slackers, and by gum, they were exactly that.<br /><br />From London and South East United Kingdom, this latest deconstruction and reassembly of the modern sound is astounding, indeed. \\"The Prayer\\" sounds like some kind of Gregorian chant, or possibly the throat singing of Tibetian monks. The ominous hum builds and is joined by the coolest guitar riff since Satisfaction, a crisp Telecaster riff, at once primative and modern. When Kele Orereke begins to sing, a similar mixture of modern and primative ensues, as electric guitars, bass, and drums, fraternize with an African chant. Lots of shifting tempos, noise and melody, melody OF noise, dance tempos, irresistable beats.<br /><br />I found their page on MySpace and watched the video for \\"The Prayer\\" and some other songs. \\"The Prayer\\" video is very good, and it just shows some modern urban kids out for a night on the town, trying to find a cool club in which to dance. Kele is a face in the crowd, lost in the shuffle, but he knows if they would only give him a chance, they would see that he is really a unique phenomenon, worthy of their attention and patience. The lyrics are really very powerful.<br /><br />Another video shows the band playing on a train, and is like one long pan from car to car of a moving train. Some kind of special effects technique was involved, because it seems like the eye of the camera dollys through the entire train, from engine to caboose, and the band and Kele keep popping up on every car.<br /><br />Other videos show band members as animated cartoon characters. Shades of Scoobey Doo, or at least The Gorillaz.<br /><br />I have just discovered this band, but from what I have seen so far, I am very impressed, and will pursue hearing more of their excellent music. A good place to start is on their MySpace page, and if you are intrigued like I was, you can get this album, A Weekend in the City, or else try their first album, Silent Alarm.ed this band, but from what I have seen so far, I am very impressed, and will pursue hearing more of their excellent music.

B0006SSOHC|4.0|Many people are either going to enjoy Saw or hate it, and both for the same reasons - those sick, twisted games you gotta play to shed blood (and usually more) to see how badly you want to live.  Not only did Saw raise the bar on horror, it practically started the whole \\"gore\\" horror sub-genre (thus leading to films like Hostel, and making it a rare find to not see a recent horror film focused more on gore than the classic horror scares.  Personally, I can't say I am in love with this film because of the gritty nature, but it is still scary entertainment to an extent nonetheless.  However, with questionable films such as these today, I still enjoy the pleasure of seeing if there is a positive message I can still hack out of this, and though it's certainly wrapped around in insanity, the message is clear - are you grateful to be alive?<br /><br />This is where Saw gets my praise for being very original.  It's certainly scary at times and packed with grit, but it also has a side of it that makes you think.  Kind of a mystery to be solved, and when the answer is revealed in the heightened climax, its quite rewarding cause no one could have ever seen it coming.  The story uses flashbacks and pieces them together like a puzzle up til the very end, and just when you thought you knew what the puzzle is going to look like, it turns out to be a whole other picture.  The traps in Saw also carry originality, putting people in near impossible situations to escape, but not impossible.  Our villain Jigsaw (Tobin Bell) is no murderer, but he finds ways for people to kill themselves - which is usually the case.  The reason for the traps is explained as a game you must play (in Jigsaw's eyes) to test and see how much you desire life.  Generally those placed in the traps are not grateful to be alive, and these horrific games quickly put things in perspective.  Once you see these scenes, its enough to say \\"Yes I am grateful.\\"<br /><br />The cast is an interesting mix for a horror film.  Danny Glover is probably the most famous actor associated with the film, but the script is somewhat limited for his role that any actor probably could have pulled it off.  Cary Elwes is also an interesting addition when I think back to his roles in Princess Bride and Men in Tights...his character is the main focus in this film and his acting may have been better suited in non-horror films.  Tobin Bell, while he gets very little screen-time as Jigsaw and even then he is usually wearing a cloak, he feels like a perfect cast (though I say this after watching the Saw sequals where he gets a lot more screentime). Tobin Bell is to Jigsaw like Anthony Hopkins is to Hannibal Lecter - you see the actor's face and that's the role he was born for.<br /><br />Overall, Saw brings a variety to a horror film, though really its much more than your basic horror film.  It focuses less on scares and more on what's truly scary - very disturbing scenarios that ask a simple question, and the mystery of events that is impossible to solve.<br /><br />Acting - 3<br />Characters - 3.5<br />Horror/Gore - 4.5<br />Story - 4.5<br />Overall - 4.

0753820250|5.0|This novel is a perfect summer read...thrilling, entertaining, and also intelligent. Zafon weaves a grand mystery, comedy, adventure, touching love story, a historical fiction, and travel log to Barcelona...into a majestic tapestry. It has an endearing protagonist and many interesting characters. I loved how the story is told and developed through some of the relatively minor characters. Very smooth writing and well paced. Overall, a masterpiece.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|I was never a big fan of Ghost Rider and when I saw this in the theater I thought it sucked.  I have no idea what was was added and what was cut for this version, but I loved this movie.  It seemed to a continuity that just wasn't in the theater release.  This is same thing they did with the Daredevil movie, excellent director's cut horrible theater version
B0000AQS0F|5.0|We took a flyer, as my husband would say, and bought this prior to seeing \\"Serenity\\" and watched it over a weekend.  (I vaguely knew about it when it was out but could never find it when it was on then it was gone.)  From the first line of the first disc to the last, we watched it straight through on a Sunday and were hooked!  I loved the series and all the characters.  They did a terrific job of truly tying all of them together so that each was interwoven through out all episodes and each was an integral part of show.  I'm not sure that the notion that this is a \\"sci-fi western\\" ever really covers it.  Yes, it's in space and yes, it has a feel of a western but it's more than that and becomes less than that as the story goes on so don't let either of those labels scare you off.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This isnt just one of the best selling albums ever for nothing.  Thriller is just an awesome album.  This is what Pop music is really meant to be.  The lyrics actually have a true meaning behind them and the beats are really great.  The album has aged pretty well too.  The voice of Jackson will always be remembered.  He is a very talented man and this is his masterpiece.  Its sad that most Pop music isnt this good anymore.
1594489505|3.0|The Kite Runner was an exceptional book in so many ways, so it was especially disappointing for me to read this just-slightly-above-average work.  It's not a bad read overall, but it fails in many of the ways that The Kite Runner flourished.  The lyricism of that first work is absent here, and the characters are much less fully realized.  I found myself not caring about any of them mid-book, and had to force myself to read on.  The structure of the novel is clumsy (Housseini drops Mariam abruptly, for too many chapters, only to bring her back no more developed than she was earlier, though years have passed).  There is some truly bad writing here and there (for instance,  \\"She was wearing a burqua...they both were...\\").  It's cynical to say so, and perhaps not very politically correct (given the author's plea for help for Afghan refugees, and given that this novel is a kind of tribute to and celebration of the nation and the people of Afghanistan) but I found the book's ending a little corny, a little too pat. I wanted to love this book because I was so impressed by Husseini's first novel.  But this is so ...ordinary.  I hope for better in the future.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I believe Binaural to be the most underrated Pearl Jam album to be released yet.  I think that where the album before it, Yield, was more heavy and rocking people wanted this to be just like it.  It truly is nothing like it.  This is actually a pretty dark album.  Not in terms of religion..etc, but in terms of emotion and how the album almost sounds as if it were sad.  If the lyrics arent dark in one song, the music usually is.  I love that about this album.  Binaural also has my favorite Pearl Jam song, Sleight Of Hand. Its a beautiful song and its always great to hear live as well.  The meaning behind the song is really deep. I just cant understand how people say this album is bad.  Its a very artistic album. There are many heavier songs, but for the most part the album is slower and more relaxed.  To me thats not a bad thing.  I love the sound of the album. The production is very cool, Ive not heard anything like it before. The whole wall of sound is very layered with different textures and elements. Its almost relaxing to listen to it. The result of the album is a band maturing in their performance and creating a fine piece of art.
B00005JPAO|1.0|This is probably a love it or hate it movie. I could care less about the Royals and all the hype over Diana. This movie was a boring, shallow portrayal of all involved. I watched the first thirty minutes hoping it would live up to the hype, the second thirty minutes were spent wondering why I was still watching it, and finally I came to my senses and ejected it. Charles is portrayed sympathetically? He was shown as a sniveling whiney person who was afraid to call the PM himself. The only interesting thing in the part that I watched was when Queen E put Tony Blair in his place by telling him he was her tenth PM, and that Winston Churchill had sat in that chair and had offerred her useful advice. Sheen captures none of Blair's sharp wit. Philip is portrayed as a retardate, and Diana (did you hear the heavenly choir when I said her name?) is portrayed as the Blessed Virgin. This movie is about as interesting as examining dirty underwear. Don't waste your valuable time.
B000002BYD|5.0|Often held up to being a true fans favorite, Yield does not disappoint.  Its a very strong album by a great band.  Here we find the band becoming much more harder than on their last album No Code.  Yield has a great vide and the band sounded like they were ready to explode with power.  In songs like Brain of J and Do The Evolution the band sounds just full of energy and like they couldnt rock any harder.  Then there is beautiful songs like All Those Yesterdays, In Hiding, and Low Light were the band hadnt sounded more melodic.  Theres still a good amount of variety here.  Sure its quite a bit less than No Code, but still isnt as straight forward as Ten, the bands first album.  I believe the one thing that makes Yield so special is the bands energy here.  Up until that point PJ hadnt sounded more energetic since their first release.  A very good album that deserves the credit that PJ fans give it.
0618871713|5.0|The humor is rather dry. However the depiction of a family with deep secrets, growing up to learn them, and navigating the way to adulthood is SPOT ON.  I was prepared NOT to like this book as prior Bechdel materials are only so-so to me. This is some of her best work. While this book may elicit a fairly negative response in some readers, the pecadillos of any family are as unique as they are both unseen by outsiders and yet their existence is universal across all families (if truth be known). Recognition of that fact is unsettling.  Bechdel handles a tricky subject with obvious care and sensitivity.
0515141429|4.0|I read a review of Mr. Child's last book in the New York Times by accident.  I immediately order the first 5 books from Amazon.  I have read 3 so far.    I liked \\"Killing Floor\\" enough to read the second one as fast as possible, I am now stuck with the third book.  I find the use of lurid passages of violence a bit too much.  the plot is simple, the main caracter is true blue and very two dimentional.  There are a number of great american and English writers in the genre that i prefer.    There are no surprises, every action can be expected in advance.

B000M4RG42|1.0|I held off even viewing the video due to the pre-release hype and spin.  I could tell then it was a piece of hollywood revisionist BS, probably   one of the worst movies I have seen in the last 10 years.    While the effort was noble,wrapped in the flag for our veterans, and protected under their halo.  The movie stunk.  It stunk because Clint was trying to make it relevant.  For example the the scene where the publicist for the bond drive rails about lack of money for the war, and the Arabs not giving us enough oil. Huh?  Are we talking WWII or Iraq. Old Clint should check his facts.  He laments that the factories can't produce bullets etc due to a bankrupt economy.  Huh?  WE WERE the worlds economy back then, producing more that all our adversaries AND Allies combined. Our soldiers on Okinawa and in the Phllipines would have been suprised to hear that we were out of bullets since they went on to fight unimpeded for another 6 months till the end of the war. The oilmen of the US, then the worlds largest producer and exporter of oil would have been amused too.  The extent of the reserves in the Middle East were not known until AFTER the war.  The US floated the Allies to victory on a ocean of oil produced in Texas and the mid continent.  Period.  The movie was pure liberal hollywood BS.     Don't get me wrong, I grew up in the military and lived on Okinawa, scene of the same kind of vicious fighting as seen on Iwo, only it lasted three MONTHS.  Eastwood has made a film worth to stand with the likes of Pearl Harbor.  It is filled to the top of a 50 gallon drum with stereotypes and ho hum characters.  If all the Marines in real life were so uninteresting then I wonder why the battle even made the papers.    Only someone totally unfamiliar with the Pacific War, the battle, and the central characters, could believe half of the \\"facts\\" presented in the movie or sit through it to it's final painful but anti-clamatic ending.    The battle sequences while well done with special effects were totally underwhelming when mutilated by the \\"artistic\\" back and forth skipping from past to present and back again.      Marines didn't dare get out of their holes at night much less yell at the top of their lungs else they would have been cut to sashimi by Japanese infiltrators.    The sterotypes were horrible.  While Ira was a tragic native american in life succumbing to alcoholism and probable PTSD, the only stereotypical prejudice he didn't endure in the movie was having to stand next to a cigar store indian.  Clint missed out on putting a scene in about the prejudice against Black troops too, who by the way, had been allowed to enlist in the Marines by that time in the war due to shortage of men.    The movie failed on so many levels.  I know that Letters from Iwo Jima will bet cudos over seas, because any movie showing US military men getting wacked plays well.  The same fanaticism and sacrifice for a demi-god displayed by the Japanese is still with us today.  I wonder if Eastwood will make THAT connection in the second part of his epic, or just protray them as tragically misled victims.  Probably the latter.
B000PTYP7U|5.0|Now, I must start off with saying that Paramore is one of my favorite bands of all time. While I love \\"All We Know Is Falling\\", I think that it is safe to say that \\"RIOT!\\" is just a little better. \\"RIOT!\\" starts just as strong as it ends with a great collection of songs that make the album rise and fall. The best track on \\"RIOT!\\" in my opinion is either \\"When It Rains\\" of \\"Let The Flames Begin\\". Regardless, all the songs are catchy and almost sing-a-long like. EVERYONE should go out and purchase \\"RIOT!\\", there is a song for everyone on it!!
B00004STUL|4.0|What can I say....Lights, camera and ACTION and LAUGHS! A great movie for a great price!  The only reason I rated it one less star is that it comes automatically with american subtitles, so each time you want to watch it again (reload) you must go into the menu and turn the subtitles off, or actually it's already set to off, but you must click it.<br /><br />But for the price I can live with that!
0312360266|5.0|Wow!<br /><br />I didn't start off loving this book. In fact I was a little lost on what was going on. Soon though I was caught up and caught in this interesting book with a totally new spin on the vampire book.<br /><br />Marked in the first pages of the book, Zoey has to leave her home and start out all over again in the House of Night. This is the Vampyre School where fledglings learn what it is to be Vampyre and to hopefully go on to become adults. If not, they die. Dealing with all the changes and her new powers Zoey has to choose to live in the past or become who she was ment to be.<br /><br />This is a great read!
B000NY845Q|2.0|Mr. Baldacci has constructed another decent summertime read. Just be prepared to have your suspension of disbelief stretched (believe it or not, compassionate terrorists!) and you'll get to muscle through some truly clunky, clumsy dialogue. I could give you several examples, but as a general rule, Baldacci uses dialogue as his method of information delivery to the audience, rather than simple explanitory prose:<br />1) You'll encounter secret service agents that evidently need to explain the mundane details of their protocols to each other.<br />2) You'll hear a clerk at the Library of Congress explain the book viewing process in painstaking detail to a guy who goes there routinely. The other guy doesn't ask him to hurry up.<br />3) You'll meet a muslim woman who articulately explains at length the many wonderful virtues of Islam to a gum-smaking American woman who can barely form a coherent sentance and is distracted by the many infidelities she's about to commit...<br /><br />You may roll your eyes. Probably more than once. If eye-rolling isn't your thing, you might just sigh and beg Mr. Baldacci to \\"GET ON WITH IT!\\"<br /><br />There are a good number of interweaving plot lines, but the paper-thin characters can make it very easy to find onesself asking, \\"Who are we talking about again? Is this the blond guy from the NSA or the brown-haired guy from the CIA or the red-head guy from the PTA?\\"<br /><br />Please don't expect a whole lot of action prior to Chapter 20. Or for a few chapters after that. At least the words are small and clip-clop along at a brisk pace.<br /><br />If all this sounds like your kind of book, then The Camel Club could be worth a guilty-pleasure read.
B00007AJGH|5.0|It's Bogey meets Bugs Bunny when 'toon-loathing detective Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins) is the lone hope of the irascible  and irritating Roger  Rabbit (voiced by Charles Fleischer) to prove his innocence when he is accused of murder. Set in the 1940s in a shadowy world reminiscent of the noir classics, Who Framed Roger Rabbit combines Disney and Warner Brothers cartoon creations in the same scenes. Randy, red-haired Jessica Rabbit (voiced by Amy Irving and Kathleen Turner) is one of the more enduring new noir characters and as it should be, it's the diabolical dame who's believed to be the root of all evil. The DVD is loaded with featurettes, and is well worth the price. (Fans of the movie should definitely read the book, as well. Warning: it's much more adult than the film!)

0765348780|2.0|[[ASIN:0765348780 Gardens of the Moon (The Malazan Book of the Fallen, Vol. 1)]]<br /><br />The Malazan Empire is in the Midst of a military campaign to<br />conquer...well everything I guess. It has recently been usurped by<br />an assassin named Laseen. Laseen has decided to continue with the<br />campaign while at the same time using the campaign to eliminate<br />internal enemies such as the bridgeburners by assigning them task<br />that cannot be completed or will end in their demise. Things appear<br />to be going well until the gods enter the fray....<br /><br />This book was not good. At many points I was very close to putting this book down but felt I should finish it hoping that as the book progressed I would be rewarded for my patience. Once again I was left disappointed and wishing I could have the time I spent reading this back.<br /><br />The Good: The book finally became somewhat interesting in about the<br />last 100 pages or so but not enough to redeem the 500+ pages prior<br />to this.<br /><br />The Bad: This book has some of the thinnest, flattest characters I<br />have ever read and there are a lot of them. It is so bad that I<br />couldn't remember who each character was once the story got back<br />around to them. Erikson's writing style is also very vague. I found<br />myself at many times wondering what just happened. There were times<br />when a new character/event was introduced and the characters are<br />talking about the person/event like it had been a main theme in the<br />story. I began wondering where I missed the previous introduction<br />of this person/event. It turns out I hadn't, it was just suddenly<br />thrown into the story as if Erikson ran into a dead point in his<br />story and quickly invented a way to redirect it or keep it going so<br />he can turn this into 10 volumes.<br /><br />Overall: Pass this one up. It isn't worth the time it takes to read<br />it and there is no shortage of other books to check out.
0743298020|5.0|As I read this book I had a hard time believing that this was Ms. Setterfield's first book.  The book is very well written indeed, and Ms. Setterfield brings her characters to life.  This is a book for people who love to read, and it was recommended to me as such.  It is a brooding, dark tale about twins, brothers and sisters and families in general.  I'm sure that we'd never find a more disfunctional family than the one that lived at Angelfield.  All kinds of strange things happened in this decaying ruin of a house.  And evil lived there (about three or four generations of it).  I really can't do justice to this gothic marvel of a book, but suffice it to say, you should read it.  Margaret Lea is a truly reluctant heroine, but she is drawn into the dark and brooding life of the Angelfield family by a request from a famous author to do her autobiography.  As she works with Vida Winter, Margaret uncovers some terrible family secrets, and she discovers a family that truly lived in the netheregions of society.  Although difficult she keeps at the task as Miss Winter delves deeper and deeper into long-buried family secrets.  This is truly a wonderful novel, and I recommend it highly.

B00005JMX6|4.0|When I picked up this movie, I was thinking it was going to a smutty comedy along the lines of American Pie / Risky Business / Porky's.  It turned out to be a bit darker than I expected, with some not so funny parts and some downright grim realities coupled in with it.  <br />  <br />Matt is a stereotypical \\"nice guy\\" who has an ordinary high school career, not very popular, not very exciting, and a bit on the dull side.  One day, a beautiful girl moves in next door and he is smitten.  Much to his surprise, he discovers Danielle is a 19 year old former adult film star.  That is, she's every horny teenage boy's dream come true.  She's running away from the life, and doesn't want anything to do with it anymore.  But she's being stalked by ghosts from the past, her manager is looking to make his investment back and he'll stop at nothing to get her back into his movies.  Soon he and his friends propose making their own movie to pay him off once and for all, and even offer some of the other popular boys to be in it.  They get many offers, and suddenly things are looking up for Matt.  <br />  <br />What a movie like this says about our culture cannot possibly be summed up in a review like this.  There are so many layers to this.  The porn industry, while it seems exciting and glamourous on the outside, is really a horrifying place where women are mislead, abused, and intimidated into preforming.  Danielle wants nothing else but to escape, and she's being stalked by the monsters who have lured her in.  Matt sees her on one hand as his ultimate object of desire, and ends up falling for her.  (Fiction!)  Matt seems to be a nice guy, but he seems to hold this porn star girlfriend closer to him for the fact that she's a former porn star and not just \\"the girl next door\\".    <br />  <br />Perhaps the most telling of events is when they are going to film the porn movie in the library of their school.  When they talk the popular boys into doing it, they jump at the chance thinking that it will enhance their status.  And the one who seems the biggest and strongest of them all can't preform.  Stuck in the situation, Matt at first volonteers to be the one, but he can't do it.  He loves Danielle too much to degrade her again.  So his friend volonteers (the biggest laugh of the movie, when he appears on camera with the fencing mask on).  And I had the best thought of the entire movie when he did that.  I just thought \\"Wow, what a good friend\\".  Perhaps that was the most noble thing of them all.

0066620996|4.0|I must admitt that I was a bit skeptical when I first bought this book, but I was pleasantly surprised when I began reading it.  Only two years out of college, my mind still thinks like a student and I was very pleased to see that this book is written very much in a way that a student likes to read a book.  Every chapter begins by building a foundation to the material that will be introduced in the chapter, then the main topic of the chapter is clearly explained with the main ideas of each chapter highlighted in text boxes throughout the chapter, and finally there is a summary of the key takeaways at the end of each chapter.  The book itself is very well structured, as it follows a very logical progression from one idea to the next, and ends with a summary chapter as well as a comparison chapter between GOOD TO GREAT and BUILT TO LAST.    I found many topics in GOOD TO GREAT extremely helpful, namely the concept of the \\"Level 5 Leader\\" and that of \\"getting the right people on the bus and the wrong people off the bus first.\\"  I will truly try to continue my career adhering to these two concepts.  The only reason why I found myself unable to rate this book a 5-star book is because upon finishing the book I found myself thinking that it was a bit unrealistic to perform every single item outlined in the book simultaneously, which according to Mr. Collins is the only way that you can achieve sustained great results in the long run.
B0006Z2KYI|4.0|At first I was amused at the story and especially the performance of Jack Benny.  Imagine him, in tights, performing Hamlet... \\"To be or not to be...\\" with that famous bland look on his face.  Maybe it's having grown up with listening to him on the radio and then watching him on TV, that I so much enjoyed him here.    <br />  <br />But after thinking a bit about the movie, I moved from being merely amused to being quite amazed at how this movie was so able to portray truly horrific events in a comedic way, during the time of the actual war.  <br />We've seen a lot of movies that show the misery of war.  We've seen some that managed to make former wars funny (MASH comes to mind, which showed the Korean War, while we were in Viet Nam). I can't think of any that managed to pull off comedy while everyone who was making it and watching it was still at risk,, with the possible exception of Stalag 17..and I'm not sure when that came out.  Can you imagine a comedy featuring Osama ben Laden or Saddam Hussein or whoever our current enemy is supposed to be?  Maybe if we laughed at our enemies more we'd disarm them....  <br />  <br />This makes me want to see the Mel Brooks version.  He's another genius who understands real comedy.  <br />
B000P0J024|5.0|The Wilburys are coming! For a long time we had suspected the return of the Wilburys on disc and finally, it has surfaced and is available on this 2 CD and 1 DVD collection. Here you find one of the most feel good classic albums ever recorded, the stellar and memorable \\"Volume One\\" from 1988. Their follow up minus Roy, \\"Volume 3\\" is also included and viewing the DVD you can see five friends having a blast recording all of this along with their 5 promo videos for the singles.    Roy and George may no longer be with us today but the music of the Traveling Wilburys has never died and is always fresh and welcoming when the odd song would appear on the radio but now at long last we have the opportunity thanks those near and dear to the band to blast these discs and feel good again.    The first disc features \\"Volume One\\" the ten original tracks that we all know and love plus two bonus tracks, \\"Maxine\\" and \\"Like A Ship\\". Personally this is one of my all time favourite albums and the enthusiasm and joy these five friends bring to the recording is so infectious.    Have a blast hearing Georges slide guitar and Bobs harmonica co-exist in perfect harmony on \\"Handle With Care\\", Tom's dry vocal on \\"Last Night\\", Bob's hilarious delivery of \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\", Roys masterful vocals weaving in and out of the songs and the galvanising force of the underappreciated Jeff Lynne.    The second disc is that DVD with priceless home footage of the recording of the album. Many thanks to Olivia and others for giving the world access to this footage. It was so nice seeing Roy's enjoyment of working with the Wilburys and his death was a tragedy.    Man those videos are so much fun but where is George's rockstar work on the microphone in the \\"Inside Out\\" video? Is there alternate videos out there?    Last, but not least is the followup album minus Roy, \\"Volume 3\\". Whilst not the album Volume One was, it was still a joy to listen to. Dylan seems to dominate on this recording. There are some fine tunes here, remember how to do the Wilbury Twist? instructions are included in the little booklet with the set it will sure leave you feeling \\"Inside Out\\".    Have fun with this collection. The Wilburys travel again!
B000002H2H|5.0|I recently got into Metallica the past few weeks (their old songs), and this was the first studio album I picked up. I have never been blown away by a more terrific album than this one. Although I have not bought MOP yet (I hear it's the best), I know that this band really had it back in the 80s. You don't even need to read the reviews on here, you can just gaze at the 5 star amazon rating. How many CDs have you seen a 5 star rating with? Highly Recommended.

B00005JPCF|2.0|I recently viewed two movies on DVD regarding Emperor penguins. One was the documentary \\"March of the Penguins\\" and the other was \\"Happy Feet.\\" I reviewed the \\"March\\" DVD and gave it five stars. Amazing film! Next came \\"Happy Feet.\\"<br /><br />\\"Happy Feet\\" is an amazing movie to be sure, but only in one way. The animation is simply awesome. Some of the scenes look so realistic that it's hard to believe it's an animation. In places, the Antarctic landscape looks totally real and the penguins can hardly be distinguished from real Emperor penguins until they start singing and dancing and going through their absurd antics. The animation is really a remarkable feat! I feel like I'll never know what to believe when watching a movie from this time on. No wonder it got an academy award!<br /><br />The content of this remarkable movie, however, was sappy. Sappy, sappy, sappy. The story was weak, to say the least. No it was more than weak; it was ludicrous. How anyone could mix animation this marvelous with a plot this vapid is beyond me. What were they thinking? I don't know, maybe kids might enjoy it. Maybe it's a movie made especially for kids. Who knows? The music was engaging, but the whole story was so insipid that it ruled out any significant enjoyment of the movie. I sat there watching and listening in awe, and feeling ill as the story rolled out. Strange combination. Hmmmmm. Maybe it would have been better with the sound turned off.<br /><br />I'm sorry, folks. Maybe I shouldn't have watched the documentary first. Maybe the right way is to watch the cartoon first. Live in a fantasy world, where penguins walk around behaving like humans and dance and sing. It's an interesting thought. Then watch the \\"March\\" documentary and see the conditions as they really are.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B000MNP2KI|4.0|So many of us are utterly incapable of dissolving our image of the suave yet sophisticated British cavilier known as 007.  The tuxedo-wearing popinjay tantalized beautiful women with confident, yet refined displays of masculine charm, and impressed his male fans with his ownership of the entire gamut of scientific contraptions of every conceivable use.  The framework of this two pronged technique of charm and mechanical know-how was glued together with violence, and thrust into a land of spies, international intrigue, deception and surprise.    With such an attractive combination of interest drawing elements, it is not at all shocking that some Bond aficionados are a bit thwarted that the most modern portrayal of the spy genre's most prolific icon has apparently departed from some of the more indispensible traits.    The bond we are presented with in Casino Royale is not the same eloquent dandy that we have growned accustomed to.  To call him a brute, and to equate him with the likes of the slope-browed, ill-mannered icons of American 1980's era action, such as Arnold and Stallone, would constitute a full-blown hyperbole.  But the new Bond is suprisingly uncouth, and graceless when compared to his former self.    His attitude is not the only change, he has done away with his impecable selection of duds, but has not totally replaced them with a formal dress code of clumsiness.  Though suit is used sporadically, he has not yet donned a pair of torn jeans with an oil stain.  If this is not the Bond you know, then imagine a Bond that has done away with at least half of his stunning staple of mechanical marvels.    Before reading any further, I would beg readers to remember, however, that this is the Bond in his early days, before he fully accomplished his 00 status.  Refinement comes with age and experience.  A young Bond does not showcase all of the same character traits as the later edition, but he is Bond nonetheless.      He has retained his extraordinary talent forwomanizing, though his tactics are a bit different, every gallant nighthawk knows that the verbiage and attitude that attracts the fairer sex is constantly changing over the years.  Similarly, Bond's knack for action is enhanced by the proverbial rocket fuel of youth.  The tireless dynamo possessed every drop of energy that was necessary to revive the modern Bond epic, which has sagged recently.    To those who say this is not Bond......    A character that is not static, a personality that develops, a life that experiences change is certainly more interesting that a constant, suit donning old chap that churns out the same performances day in and day out.  James Bond, as spotless as he is perceived, was not born in a suit.    In addition to the brilliant and gradual development of young Bond, the viewers are immediately treated to a brilliant chase scene, a staple of the Bond genre.  The stunts are well done and choreographed to near perfection throughout, and our protaganist shows a profoud and diverse sense of character.  Energetic, spontaneous, and aggressive, he demonstrates the youthful vigor that a young Bond surely possessed.  His measured violence and ruthlessness add colour to the film and the plot.    The film would not be complete without the famous utterance \\"Bond, James Bond.\\"  When it happens, it happens with the young agent clad in a sharp suit.  It acquires more meaning and signifies his gradual growth into the classic Bond.    To those who allege that this is no Bond movie, my retort, is that it adds to Bond, it embellishes the legend, it is a peak into his development, it makes it stronger.  The action is enough for this film to stand on its own, but it does much more, it adds to a modern epic.

B00005JPD0|4.0|Denzel Washington plays Agent Carlin, a sharp, valiant AFT agent who is so extraordinary talented, that he can analyze a crime scene with little more than a glance or quick walk-through.    These talents come in handy when a ferry, full of innocent people suddenly explodes near New Orleans.  The terrorist who sent the 500+ people to their fiery deaths filled up an SUV with explosives and all of the evidence seems to have been blown sky high.      That is, until Carlin checks his voice mail and discovers a phonecall that took place shortly before the explosion.  The phonecall would be of little consequence if not for the fact that the young woman who made the phonecall washed up on shore dead, but was not a victim of the explosion.    A little ingenius reasoning in typical Denzel fashion comes to the conclusion that the killer of this young woman is also the terrorist.  But there isn't enough evidence to find this man/woman.  Impressed by Carlin's skills, he is recruited into an elite group of investigators bent on finding the mysterious terrorist before he permanently escapes or strikes again.    Carlin finds out that the investigators have a set up of high tech imaging equipment that might just get a glimpse of the young woman who washed up dead, or, better yet, her killer.  But something happens, the plot takes several twists and Carlin starts to experience a little Deja Vu as he visits the key sites of the investigation.      He begins to fall in love with the images of the woman who was murdered and starts to doubt the imaging equipment is really what they say it is.  You might just think that Carlin is the terrorist, with his odd recollection of the crime scene, and you may or may not be right.  Perhaps there is a conspiracy that strikes at the very heart of America, or perhaps it is something else entirely.  What is certain, is that the evil is efficient and frightening and might be deeper and darker than a single warped mind.    For a few moments, I thought the the investigation began to question the very essence of time and space and thought I had it all figured out.  I was wrong.    The acting is superb, the plot twists keep the viewer glued to the seat, and there is sporadic action that is always well done.  For those who like suspense, don't miss this one.  The actors are well selected for their roles, the cinematography conveys an action filled and mysterious environment to near perfection, and the dialogue is neither excessive nor insufficient.  The movie is well balanced and well put together for a nail biting Saturday night.      The ending has a prophetic message.  Like many unusual endings, there are some who may leave unsatisfied.  They prefer the predictable, stereotype image that we have grown accustomed to.  I say, plot twists and suprises are welcome, after all, this is a thriller.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|Director Alfred Hitchcock was worthy of the title of \\"Master of Suspense.\\" Some of his greatest successes, critically and commercially, were steeped in psychological terror, sexual tension/confusion, political intrigue, or his frequent use of mistaken identity in his plots.<br /><br />While \\"To Catch a Thief\\" does have the \\"wronged man\\" scenario, in the guise of Cary Grant's cat burglar trying to prove his innocence, the film is more a showcase for the classy pairing of Grant and co-star Grace Kelly, along with the magnificent allure of The French Riviera, playground of the rich and famous.<br /><br />Featuring luscious scenery and dazzling costumes by the legendary Edith Head, the movie is a feast for the senses and a testament to a time when there were MOVIE STARS.<br /><br />Even with its fairly uncomplicated plot. the shared scenes of Grant and Kelly together are sheer heaven while John Williams and Jessye Royce Landis put the capital \\"C\\" and \\"A\\" in the term character actor.<br /><br />The \\"extra\\" featurettes on the disc are equally as appealing, complete with interviews with Hitch's daughter Patricia and a fascinating profile of Head.<br /><br />And the restoration of the film makes the French countryside look picture perfect.
0385522401|5.0|A brilliant book, but such a sad one; it would be unfair not to say so up front. Ian McEwan is a master at dissecting emotions. Every page of this wonderfully-crafted novel gave me the uncanny feeling of living within the skins of the two main characters, Edward and Florence, just married as the book opens. When they fall in love, nurture ambitions, experience happiness, I feel these things too. But when happiness eludes them, the pain is unbearable, not least because the author never lets us forget by how small a margin their happiness was missed.<br /><br />In his last major novel, [[ASIN:1400076196 SATURDAY]], McEwan pulled back from the multi-decade scope of [[ASIN:0385503954 ATONEMENT]] its predecessor, choosing to confine himself to the events of a single day. Here, the essential action occupies a mere three hours, described in a book which is itself unusually compact, a mere novella of only 200 delicate pages. In an opening that is surely a homage to Matthew Arnold's \\"Dover Beach,\\" the new husband and wife sit in a hotel room within sound of the sea on England's South coast. They eat a mediocre meal in one room; in the next, their bed stands waiting. They love each other, there is never any doubt about that, but they are inexperienced and secretly afraid. The book tells how they came to that moment, and what becomes of their love and fears as they move from one room into the other.<br /><br />I have not known McEwan to write before in such detail about sex, but his writing is never prurient. Every detail serves to illustrate the psychological intercourse between these two talented and caring young people. On this particular night, as in a high-stakes game, their honeymoon bed becomes the board upon which all the other pieces of their relationship must be played. By going back to the early 1960s, that dark hour just before the dawn of the sexual revolution, McEwan performs the remarkable feat of undoing the modern liberation of sex from marriage and returning to a mindset in which marriage was not only a contract for sex, but sex might also be a prime reason for marriage.<br /><br />But not the only reason. The focus on the bedroom also makes you consider all the other qualities that these two bring to their marriage, and before long you feel that you know them very well. [Exceptionally well in my case, since I was also born in Britain in the same year (1940), and share qualities with each of them; readers might take this into account when weighing the objectivity of my reactions.] Edward is a bright young man from the country who has recently achieved a first-class academic degree. Florence comes from a more socially sophisticated family, though she herself is naive in most things. The one exception is her calling as a violinist; here as in SATURDAY, McEwan is extraordinary in his use of music; the sections describing Florence's quartet playing are right up there with Vikram Seth's [[ASIN:037570924X AN EQUAL MUSIC]], my touchstone for sensitive writing about musicians. So both are bright, both are talented, both feel the stirring of new possibilities, but there are big differences between them, socially and culturally (Edward, for example, is into rock), and they each want different things. But the most heartbreaking things in this book are not their differences, but how often and how close they come to making new connections; just an inch more, a moment longer, and everything might be all right.... Almost.<br /><br />But McEwan does not end the story in the bedroom or on the beach below. Much as in ATONEMENT, though in only a few pages, he adds an epilogue continuing the story forward several decades. At the time, I felt it was too brief to settle all the emotions stirred up by the preceding pages, but now as I write, several hours after closing the book, I begin to see its rightness and appreciate its consolation.which marriage was not only a contract for sex, but sex might also be a prime reason for marriage.    But not the only reason. The focus on the bedroom also makes you consider all the other qualities that these two bring to their marriage, and before long you feel that you know them very well.

Almost.    But McEwan does not end the story in the bedroom or on the beach below. Much as in ATONEMENT, though in only a few pages, he adds an epilogue continuing the story forward several decades. At the time, I felt it was too brief to settle all the emotions stirred up by the preceding pages, but now as I write, several hours after closing the book, I begin to see its rightness and appreciate its consolation.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I must admit, I agree with all the positive and constructively critical reviews here...my only addition is that I think DT have truly melded their best 'sounds' together on this one.  Since SFAM and I&M, I guess I have been looking for the next best thing, probably like most fans have judging from the reviews.  Well, not a realistic thing, and I want sooo bad to hear my gods do just that.  A tall order.  Well, this CD serves it up a vast majority of the time.  Take Octavarium...so much hope in this, so little delivery, however had some awesome tracks.  TOT - I have grown to love this CD, however it is rather rough at times, and no DT grandiose thematic thing happening and no really great ballads.      So here we are with Systematic Chaos....and you have all the best of the past 2 CD's, along with hints of Awake 'edge', SFAM epic, 6DOIT spaciness/balladry, and some Falling into Infinity here and there...and some new 'sounds' as well. Any DT fan should be relieved that the instrumentation is BACK, although you may have heard some of it before.  It is on the 'dark side' as far as lyrics and some of the music, but the whole CD pulls you through an experience - one that I have come to expect of these HM masters of prog prog rock - and that experience was great.    Bottom line - the BEST thing they have done since SFAM - a very cohesive, wailing, moody masterpiece! (NOT an easy task)  DT fans must get this, and judging from the latest chart sales, it looks like you have!!!!  DT Forever!
0316010669|4.0|A very interesting novel. A combination of first thoughts, wisdom, and experience brings us to the title \\"Blink\\". I have always enjoyed the reading on the whys and wherefores of actions of the human race. Always being surprised this book brought the fact to me that somewhere along the line I had learned quite a bit. I hightly recommend the book.
0374105235|5.0|In the memoir A Long Way Gone, by Ishmael Beah, the experience the writer goes through is such a drastic life changing event, few people can compare.  Throughout the telling of his story, Ishmael uses great scene writing as he vividly describes certain events in his life.  He accurately recounts certain battles he fought and conveys great emotion in the way he retells these moments.  He sets the scene for the reader and creates an atmosphere as if the reader was there.     As well as putting his readers in his story, Ishmael builds characters very well.  From emotions on their faces to scares on their body, Ishmael describes every character with both physical and emotional detail.  Ishmael as able to capture emotions of other child soldiers as their faces detailed the agony that they all were facing.  From the use of drugs to witnessing murders daily, the faces that Ishmael had seen had a story within themselves.   And lastly, Ishmael reflected on the way he found his true identity.  In the beginning of the memoir, Ishmael reflects on how he was a peaceful, a bit reserved young boy who loved rap music.  After becoming a child soldier, Ishmael became violent and aggressive and it was as if he was born into a different body after his childhood.  He was no longer the peaceful boy that he had once knew but rather the drugged up, blood thirsty killer.  The affects of the war had a horrific impact on Ishmael but luckily, with the help from the Benin Camp, Ishmael slowly returned to his normal self.
8489367116|5.0|The first time that I came across Shantaram in a bookstore I was put off by its length.  It is over 900 pages long and it is heavy.  However I had heard good things about it and decided to give it a go.  I am so glad that I did, because this is one of the best books that I have ever read.  Even though it's long, it is gripping and easy to read.  It was one of those books that you carry round with you so that you can read a page here and a page there and you never want to put it down.<br /><br />The story is based on the real life adventures of the author, Gregory David Roberts.  As  the book begins, he has escaped from prison in Australia and made his way to India.  Later on we find out more about how he broke out from prison but it's testament to how enthralling the story is that this is not the most eventful part of the book.  When he arrives in Mumbai (Bombay) he quickly immerses himself into the city, befriending the locals, learning the languages and even living in a slum.  He also befriends a local mafioso and is drawn into the Indian crime world.  The story twists and turns and would be unbelievable if it wasn't based so much on fact.  Gun runners in Afghanistan, high class prostitutes, Bollywood movie sets and grim Indian prisons all make their appearances.  It's a fascinating, suspenseful and exciting book.<br /><br />Roberts has a gift for writing.  He really captures the flavor of India - the smells, the sounds, the colors.  After reading this book I felt like jumping on a plane to Mumbai and heading straight to Leopold's for a drink.  Instead I settled for recommending it to all my friends, and despite the very different genres that they usually read, they have all loved it also.  It's that kind of book.  Don't miss it.
B000002KBU|5.0|This is my favourite Joni Mitchell album. There are no weak songs, its both lyrically and musically perfect and Joni's voice is simply amazing.<br /><br />The musical arrangements are either guitar or piano (both frequently played by Joni) with little else to distract you from the quality of the songs. Stephen Stills and James Taylor also guest on the album but their contributions are subtle and restrained. Calling a favourite track is almost impossible since as you listen to each track the last song you heard replaces the previous to become your new favourite.<br /><br />This is without doubt the finest example of any early 70's singer/songwriter album. This should be in everybodies collection, especially at the price you can buy it for now.
B000OVLBEO|4.0|Any film that has motorcycles, demons, stunts involving helicopters and flaming skulls has to be great, right?  Not exactly.  \\"Ghost Rider\\" is far from being a great film.  In fact, it's pretty bad in spots.  What makes it worthy of four stars, however, is the fact that the director and the cast seem to be having a whole lot of fun with a story that comes from way out of left field.<br /><br />In \\"Ghost Rider,\\" Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage) makes a deal with the devil, Mephistopheles (a cheeky Peter Fonda), in order to save his father's life.  As is always the case, the devil has an alternate plan in the works and tricks Johnny into becoming his lifelong bounty hunter, the Ghost Rider.  Blaze goes on to live what seems to be a charmed life where he dances with death constantly but never perishes.  When the devil's son, Blackheart (Wes Bentley), finally surfaces on Earth looking for one of his daddy's old contracts, the devil calls upon his rider to stop him.  Blaze transforms into the very imposing and very flaming Ghost Rider and seeks out Blackheart.  If he carries out this one mission, the devil agrees to rid him of his curse.  While on the hunt, Blaze has to juggle a rekindling romance between himself and his old flame, Roxanne (Eva Mendes), a stunt biking career managed by the very concerned Mack (a funny Donal Logue), and the belief that he's a murderer.  He also befriends the Caretaker (Sam Elliott), who seems to have all of the answers.<br /><br />Overall, this film is not great.  It's just that is has a wonderfully stylized feel with deep blue and fiery red colors all about it that plays with your inner child.  The atmosphere is light, despite the demonic undertones.  I often caught myself going ga-ga over the excellent CGI effects as the Rider tore up the side of a skyscraper or took out Blackheart's lackeys with tongue firmly in cheek.  Cage hams it up as Blaze, channeling the soul of Elvis as he swaggers across the screen.  Fonda and Elliott, both silver screen steadies, eat their respective roles up with demonic flare and lawdog wisdom.  Even the supposedly sinister Blackheart is fun to watch.  Most actors weighed down with dismal dialogue such as Bentley is given would collapse on the screen, but Bentley manages to make you laugh with the delivery of classic one-liners such as, \\"I don't think so!\\"  Eva Mendes seems to be the only person in the film who is remotely trying to take her role seriously, but even she seems to be having fun with this tale as well.<br /><br />Mark Steven Johnson (\\"Daredevil\\") knows how to make a film very cool despite a dodgy script.  Johnson uses some twisty camera angles to drop the viewer right into the middle of the action.  The fight sequences are fairly light on actual human action and rely heavily on CGI.  This makes for a rather weak climax, but you can't help but watch it.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" isn't for everybody.  If you're a comic purist, you'll probably scoff at the way that this film picks and chooses elements of the entire \\"Ghost Rider\\" canon and collects them into one character.  If you're an action fan, you may grow tired of the constant CGI battle sequences.  However, if you've always loved B-movies and wonder what one would look like with a very large budget and a \\"knows what's cool looking\\" director guiding it, \\"Ghost Rider\\" is a definite purchase.  I personally enjoy it more than a lot of the other comic flicks I've seen.  With all of the dark and menacing adaptations flying around lately, it's nice to see a comic film that's just pure fun.eat their respective roles up with demonic flare and lawdog wisdom.

067003830X|5.0|\\"The Brain That Changes Itself: Stories of Personal Triumph from the Frontiers of Brain Science\\" by Norman Doidge, is an easily readable, enjoyable, and thought-provoking book that gives the nonprofessional an overview of the new science of neuroplasticity--the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections over the life span. We learn that the brain is no longer thought of as being hard-wired, that people are no longer believed to be merely products of their genes and environment, and that damaged brains have the remarkable ability to repair themselves.<br /><br />Doidge recounts stories of real people who have benefited from advances in neuroplasticity. He gives us just enough background information about each case so that we find ourselves genuinely caring about these people--each person comes to life, like characters in a fine novel. He tells us stories about stroke victims with major physical dysfunction who were able to recover nearly everything that they lost, and then go on to live normal lives again. There is an astonishing story of a woman who lost her balance mechanisms; with help from neuroplasticians, she was able to rewire her brain to use other senses to achieve the same goal. We learn that neuroplastic physicians can design high-technology devices capable of bringing sight to the blind, hearing to the deaf, and movement to the paralyzed. We learn about an utterly courageous woman who, completely on her own, was able to rewire her brain to compensate for a large number of severe learning disabilities. Eventually, she goes on to found a very successful network of schools devoted to the methodologies she used.<br /><br />The basic concept is simple: the brain can change itself--rewire itself, so to speak. Often it needs only a little structured help to force it into making the new connections.<br /><br />The implications of this new science are staggering. Imagine retraining the brains of the severely mentally disadvantaged--the learning disabled, the autistic...perhaps even the psychopath--so that they are able to function almost normally in society. Imagine the impact this new science may have on prison rehabilitation, special education, psychiatry, and rehabilitation therapy, to name but a few. This is a truly astonishing new frontier, and Doidge makes the concepts easy and enjoyable. I recommend this book highly.autistic...perhaps even the psychopath--so that they are able to function almost normally in society.

B000002C1W|1.0|listened to this for the first time in many, many years....they were trying to SOUND LIKE Pink Floyd, but couldn't pass it off without Roger Waters....totally contrived and insincere....eh, Waters may be the biggest jerk in the world (not sure he is), but even if he is, he is one talented jerk....this is pathetic compared to the likes of \\"Animals\\", and the rest of their 70s output....these people saying it's equal to previous, Waters-led Floyd are delusional....if you like it, fine, but don't even try to pass it off as legit PF.  they lived off the name and legend of Pink Floyd - give them another name like Endless Self-Indulgence and attach this album to it and it would never have even made a major record contract.
B000OVLBEO|1.0|I wouldn't say that Nicolas Cage ruined this movie. It was more of a collective effort. Let's start with the writer and director, Mark Steven Johnson. He also made Daredevil which is surprising because that was actually a good movie if you saw the director's cut version. But no amount of reediting can save Ghost Rider.<br />Nicolas Cage is responsible for creating a character that is part Elvis part idiot. Johnny Blaze starts out the movie being played by Matt Long. And that was actually the best part of the movie because he was going a great job with the character. Once you bring in Nicolas Cage, it all falls apart. This guy takes cheesy dialog and finds ways of making it ten times worse. And he can't pull off that wig he's wearing either. I will give him credit for getting his body in shape though. I'm sure he worked in his contract where he gets to appear shirtless. But that was also one of the most painful scenes in the movie as Cage is making goofy faces at his mirror.<br />Oh, and we're supposed to believe that Matt Long grows up to be Nicolas Cage? That's an insult to Matt Long who...isn't ugly.<br />Now on to Wes Bently who played Blackheart. This guy couldn't act to save his life. Bently can sleep at night knowing he played the lamest villain ever in a super hero movie. And I'm counting Sharon Stone who played Brick Girl in Catwoman. There was only one way Ghost Rider could defeat this guy...and he LETS him!<br />So Ghost Rider is a super hero movie, right? An action movie? Where was the action? I'll spoil the movie right now. Ghost Rider defeats his enemies by saying \\"Look into my eyes\\" and then they burn up. That's it. He looks at them. Wow! Cool huh? There are a group of bad guys he has to defeat. None are any challenge AT ALL to him! All he does is look at them! Oh..and one time he twirled his chain.<br />The special effects were, at times, pretty cool. But they don't make up for the horrible writing, directing, and acting. This ranks up there with one of the worst comic book movies ever made.book movies ever made.
B000024D4R|3.0|It could be said of most of Pink Floyd's recorded ouevre that it is something of an acquired taste.  And the effort of acquiring the taste is made harder still by the subtleties of their music.  That is, a Pink Floyd album will not disclose all of its facets to the listener at once.  Rather, a certain amount of dedication, repeated careful review, is required to \\"see the whole\\", as it were.<br /><br />This is probably truer of \\"Animals\\" than it is of any of their other work.  \\"Animals\\", to begin with, lacks the lush, atmospheric Leslie-treated pianos and spacey guitars of \\"Meddle\\", or the warping, bubbling, synth-work and studio sleight-of-hand of \\"Dark Side\\" or \\"Wish.\\"  \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"The Wall\\" were recorded with full orchestras to assist in particularly emotional moments.  Whether the orchestral experimentation of \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"The Wall\\" were successful is another question, altogether.<br /><br />\\"Animals,\\" then, is more of a straight-up rock and roll record than the other Floyd albums.  It was basically written \\"on the fly,\\" during the band's tours in support of \\"Wish\\" through '75-76.  Although this is documented in interviews with Messrs. Gilmour and Water themselves, the fact could be confirmed from listening to live outings of songs from \\"Animals\\" -- they sound just like the studio versions, almost as though they were written with live, rather than studio, performance in mind.  There are very little in the way of doubled instrumental parts or voices (some acoustic guitar parts are overdubbed in \\"Pigs\\", I believe, but other than that, the whole thing is basically just the four players and their voices).<br /><br />The band's musical values have changed here.  Gone are Gilmour and Wright's airy harmonizations from \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Meddle\\", to be replaced by the throatier growling and ranting of Roger Waters, who sings almost the entirety of the album's lyrics.  Gilmour sings the very beginning of \\"Dogs\\" (\\"You've gotta have a real need/Gotta sleep on your toes\\").<br /><br />And the instrumental sound, or the approach, perhaps, has changed as well.  Here, the guitar-playing of Gilmour takes on a decidedly more aggressive, charged, attitude.  Witness, for example, the ragged outbursts between the first few verses of \\"Dogs\\"; Gilmour, although always capable of emotional depth, rarely chooses to depict raw anger in his solos.<br /><br />The angriest moment comes at the finish of \\"Pigs.\\"  The song, which has built up nice bit of rhythmic tension with its half-time feel and the suggestive in-drawn breaths from Roger Waters in the final verse, suddenly lets loose with Gilmour's cataclysmic outro-solo.<br /><br />The solo starts with the same note repeated almost a dozen times, picked hard (much harder than Gilmour's usually genteel touch), beat to within an inch of its life.  He moves up the neck into stratospheric territory, then, in a musical gesture recalling Milton's description of Satan's defeat (\\"Hurled headlong flaming from th' ethereal sky/With hideous ruin and combustion down\\"), plummets back down with a series of triplets that return almost all the way to first position.<br /><br />The intensity builds back up, until Gilmour finds a rapid-fire sixteenth-note triplet arpgeggio near the top of the neck and rides it out through the fade.  This is not the beautiful, sensitive Gilmour we know from \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" or \\"On the Turning Away.\\"  It is another personality altogether, but one capable of searing intensity.<br /><br />Perhaps, in the final analysis, Gilmour's mastery is demonstrated by the fact that -- knowing that he could solo in the white-hot vein of an Eric Clapton or Robin Trower, say -- he chooses not to do so all of the time.  The rareness of such an outburst -- I could almost say its uniqueness, but for the slightly less brillant solo of a similar emotional tenor at the end of \\"Comfortably Numb\\" -- is part of what makes it great.<br /><br />Gilmour never quite equaled this moment at the end of \\"Pigs\\" in any of his subsequent outings.  While \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is comparable, it does not quite echo the rawness of tone here.  Also of note is some of the playing on his first solo album of 1977, \\"David Gilmour\\" (although there the emotional content seems to be more \\"woe\\" or \\"tragedy\\").<br /><br />Furthermore, these are Waters's best lyrics -- they are by turns creepy, funny (some of the double-entendre in \\"Pigs On The Wing\\"), and accurate (the spot-on businessman psychoanalysis of \\"Dogs\\").hile \\"Comfortably Numb\\" is comparable, it does not quite echo the rawness of tone here.

0743496728|5.0|After a disappointing last outing (2006's THE TENTH CIRCLE), Jodi Picoult is back in top form with her latest novel, NINETEEN MINUTES.  Her new novel takes place in Sterling, New Hampshire, a small town among New England's small towns. Sterling is a nice, peaceful place to live -- until one bright morning in March, when high school student Peter Houghton takes a gun to school and opens fire, killing nine of his classmates and one of his teachers.  The detective who arrives on the scene, Patrick Ducharme (previously seen in Picoult's novel PERFECT MATCH), finds Peter in the gymnasium, trembling, with the  weapon he just used to kill ten people held to his own head.  Not far away, Josie Cormier, Peter's former friend, lies unconscious at the side of her dead boyfriend, Matt -- who was the only victim shot twice.    In the aftermath of the shooting, Picoult begins to peel away the layers of the tragedy, taking readers seamlessly from the past to the present.  We see a town, its inhabitants broken by loss, shocked by the total devastation nineteen minutes of carnage can leave in its wake, preparing for a trial that ultimately becomes a media circus. What people were is juxtaposed brilliantly with what they've become after Peter's rampage.  Picoult tells her story from multiple perspectives -- most notably, that of Peter's mother, who is consumed with blame and self-pity, and of Josie's mother Alex, the judge assigned to Peter's case, who struggles to maintain her objectivity while trying to understand a daughter she no longer knows.  At the heart of the novel, though, are Josie's and Peter's narratives -- each one heartbreaking and insightful in its own way.  We meet them in kindergarten, when the bullies start picking on Peter and Josie defends him. We watch their friendship grow, until Josie starts hanging out with the popular crowd in junior high.  We see Josie and Peter both sink into their own kind of unhappiness then, as Peter withdraws into his computer games andJosie withdraws into herself.    The best thing about NINETEEN MINUTES (besides Picoult's brilliant characterizations, which are always spot-on) is the fact that Picoult doesn't excuse Peter's actions -- and she doesn't condemn him for them.  There is no right and wrong in this novel, no black and white -- there is uncertainty instead, and irresolution.  Picoult's task is daunting in NINETEEN MINUTES: She seeks to make her readers understand both sides of her timely topic -- a topic that affects us all universally in one way or another. Some of us have been picked on; some of us have been the people doing the bullying. Others fall somewhere in the middle, silently observing and saying nothing. Readers are encouraged to think about big issues as Picoult asks us a very difficult question:  Did they deserve it?      NINETEEN MINUTES is beautifully written, in the artful prose Picoult has become known for over the course of her illustrious career.  The novel is seamlessly structured, and its characters couldn't be any better. The novel's one flaw is its ending, which, as other reviewers have stated, does ring untrue.  But I, at least, don't read Picoult's novels for her beginnings or her endings; it's what happens in the middle -- the characters we meet, the insights we glean, the emotions we feel -- that's truly special.    NINETEEN MINUTES is a profound, provocative, startling tale from one of America's bravest authors. It's a heartbreaking book, one that will make you think while it's making you cry. The subject matter of NINETEEN MINUTES is hard to read, but the reality is that it SHOULD be read, in every high school in this country. Highly, highly recommended.
1594489505|5.0|This is an absolutely perfect book! I have never read a book before that stirred up in me every possible human emotion imaginable. The story starts out following the life of Mariam, whose life has been filled with unimaginable sorrows, and leads to the entwining of her life with another woman, Laila. Mariam and Laila have led completely different lives until a war surprisingly thrusts them together. Mariam never had the opportunity for school, while Laila was expected to get a great education(her father was a school teacher). Laila was in love with her lifelong best friend(Tariq), and they wanted to marry, but a rocket striking her village changed her life forever. Mariam was forced to marry a much older, brutally cruel man, and never felt love. I won't spoil the book with all the details, but the two women's lives are inexplicably crossed in the most heartbreaking way. This story is of a war torn country and the struggles to survive and the beauty of all the small everyday luxuries that all of us take for granted. The author gives us a glimpse of a secret world that we never get to see from that perspective. There were many times in the book that I felt like I was actually there, standing in the midst of it all, watching through a secret window. The writing style is simply beautiful and full of flavor. Everyone needs to read this book, men and women~ I promise that you won't be disappointed.
B000024D4R|5.0|politically, Roger Waters is a total idiot, but as a musician, he's awesome....this album is simply about the best rock piece ever....I read this more about (despite whatever Waters' intentions) as commentary about Man, not capitalism....aftyer all, capitalism is NOT an \\"ism\\", it is what Man would naturally do without any State apparatus lording over it with the threat of force.  a real treat, but not something for a party, or dancing....which is a good thing.
0596009208|1.0|If you already know programming, or you're happy with being given vague hints of what things do rather than an organized explanation, this might a fine text for learning Java.  This book throws language features at you, without following any of them up with discussion when or why you might want to use certain features.  So if you don't want the book's first programs to include all of: variables, loops, method calls, and boolean values all one one page (with only sporadic re-visitations to the topic), then another text might be better for you.    To its credit, this book does manage to present the material in a way unlike any other, which can appeal to certain learning styles.

I discovered her years ago, and I have collected all her albums. They are all beautiful. Each is like a \\"unit\\" unto itself, all the songs connecting and holding together as one.<br /><br />This album is breathtaking, and with each listening (as all her albums are) you come to love it more and more deeply. If you already know Loreena, then you know you \\"want\\" this album. If you do not know who she is, or have not heard her music, then by all means, \\"trust me\\" on this, and pick up a copy of this marvelous album, take it home, make yourself a cup of tea, turn the lights down low, and sit quietly and let the beauty of her music wash over you....you won't be sorry, and, you'll probably start a search for all the remainder of her releases, too! ~operabruin

B000PKG6TE|2.0|I have been a QOTSA fan for many years now, and have been enthralled by every record. That is until now. Lullabies to Paralyze, a record much lambasted by critics, I found to be a fantastic LP. Full of heavy riffs, well constructed songs, and great melodies to boot. But this new offering is pallid and weak. Even the production and engineering is sub par. It sounds flat and lifeless, muddy and indistinct. I know that their albums take many repeat listens to attain full \\"enlightenment\\", and that is why I gave Era Vulgaris more time to sink in than I would give ANY other LP, just because it's QOTSA. But it did not take. I can't even get past track 2 now. When \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" comes on, I just have to chuckle. It's so cheezy. Nothing on this album rocks. The drumming is boring and has a lack of innovation, which is strange for Joey Castillo, a remarkable drummer. The two best songs are slower, lighter numbers. Maybe they should have done a whole LP with softer, melodic material, not the in-between weak \\"rock lite\\" numbers. Where's the rock? Where's the catchy melodies you can't get out of your head? This utterly forgettable LP is totally devoid of Homme's usual delights. Perhaps the new father has gotten soft on us. I don't want to write this band off because they have always been #1 for me, but it will be difficult to recover from this blunder. Perhaps the occasional QOTSA fan will enjoy this record, but the true fans will know that is is a milquetoast disappointment.

B000NVIXDW|4.0|I used to think this guy was lame, probably because he's young, has a somewhat corny last name, and sings in a throwback crooner style. Also, friends of mine would joke about him and guys like John Mayer and James Blunt being major pansies. I've only heard a few tracks of this album so far, but boy is it good. I usually listen to mildly dark and drum-heavy music, but I'm totally digging the charisma and boldness this album projects. It has definitely added another dimension to my music library and listening habits. John Mayer, you're next.
B00013F35I|5.0|You can't crank this loud enough.  Bruce is the best live performer bar none.  There are so many amazing, no, make that AMAZING performances on this DVD but all you have to do is watch one to be a believer--tune it right to \\"Born in the USA.\\"  You cannot look away.  The energy is like nothing else, it is truly incredible that the energy can still be conveyed via a DVD.  Even more incredible is that you then remember that Bruce is playing the song in Spain.  This is a mind-blowing DVD.
B000002B7U|2.0|The line up in 1985,1986: Ozzy Osbourne: vocals, Jake E.Lee: Guitar, Phil Soussan: Bass Guitar, Randy Castillo: Drums. Great lineup, there is no question about it. I bought this recording on vinyl in Feb. 1986, hoping for a great record to follow the awesome successes of Blizzard 1980, Diary 1981, Bark 1983. I was very dissapointed with The Ultimate sin. The reason for my opinion is not the great band lineup Ozzy had with this record, it was that Ozzy decided to go glam rock like bands of the mid to late 1980s. Motley Crews first two records were great, Crews debut album: 1982s \\"Too Fast For Love\\", 1983s \\"Shout At The Devil\\" they stuck to hard crisp rock, metal. Then \\"Theatre Of Pain\\" came out in the summer of 1985, which was a total Crue sellout to glam rock and softer music. Even Crews dress style made me realize they sold out to the Glam rock which would dictate the style of most 1980s rock bands. \\"Theatre Of Pain\\" was a total turn from Crews first two albums when they cared about thier music and not  making \\"Smokin In The Boys Room\\" remake. I remember after listening to the vinyl of \\"Theatre Of Pain\\" for the first time, that day in July 1985, and being totally amazed how the Crew sold out thier music and thier early fans. From that day on I refer to \\"Theatre Of Pain\\" as \\"Theatre Of Shame\\". I mention \\"[[ASIN:B00008OLIN Theatre of Pain]]\\", because I believe when Ozzy got out of the rehab and got his life back together in 1985, he saw the Glam rock image Motley Crew had with \\"Theatre Of Pain\\" and figured this will be an image he would go with, with \\"The Ultimate Sin\\". I really believe \\"Theatre Of Pain\\" influenced \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" that is the reason for its soft glam rock style. I will say Jake E Lees guitaring on \\"Sin\\" is awesome. Phil Soussan does a really good job on bass guitar, Randy Castillo handles the drums well, my only complaint is I wish the drums on \\"Sin\\" were a little harder, to me they are softer and don't sound right on an Ozzy recording. If Ozzy went the glam rock look and sound, what a horrible mistake he made with \\"The Ultimate Sin\\". I wonder if the iron maiden herself Sharon Osbourne advised Ozzy to the glam rock style just so Ozzy could keep up with the times in the mid 1980s and keep the cash register flowing for the Osbournes. The band lineup is great, it is just a shame it had to be wasted on this ill concieved effort. I have listened to \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" many times and after 21 years this recording has not grown on me. \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" is a pure sellout of the mid 1980s glam rock invasion. The song Ozzy hates the most is the song I like and the best on \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" that is \\"Shot In The Dark\\". That is part of the reason I bought \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" the other reason was it was Ozzy. I had a friend who I was in high school with who did not care for \\"The Ultimate Sin\\", saw Ozzy with Metallica on tour in April 1986 and he told me The Ultimate Sin sounded great live. Metallica was still pumping out great metal in those days with the 1986 metal epic \\"[[ASIN:B000002H33 Master of Puppets]]\\", before they bit the sellout mode with their 1991 black album and have continued since. I even like Ozzy releases from 1988s \\"No Rest For the Wicked\\", 2007s \\"Black Rain\\"([[ASIN:B000068QZK No Rest for the Wicked (Exp)]], ([[ASIN:B000PUB8H4 Black Rain]]), better than \\"The Ultimate Sin\\". I will always love the Ozzman, but \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" is by far the Ozzmans worst. That is why many people bash this recording. I believe Ozzy did hate \\"Ultimate Sin\\" that is why he came back with a vegence with his next two releases 1988s \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\" and 1991s \\"No More Tears\\". Ozzy went back to what made him great with these two afore mentioned releases. Those readers who like \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" I do respect your views on this recording and learn from them negative or positive. I'm giving \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" two stars only because it is Ozzy and because of the great band lineup, and the great Jake E. Lee, and of course \\"Shot In The Dark\\".
0060595183|5.0|The Doors of Perception    This book is written in the form of an essay and recounts the experiences of the author after taking mescalin for the first time.  It is a fairly short read, about 80 pages, but the philosophical reflections require time to fully grasp.  Huxley volunteers to be the guinea pig in a controlled experiment to observe the effects of mescalin.  The resulting experience gave cause for Huxley to reflect deeply on the nature of reality and how humans shape this reality through perception.  What is perceived in one state of consciousness as real can indeed become something altogether different in another.  Huxley explores this intertwined relationship and places it in a larger historical context recalling the works and deeds of the visionaries and mystics of the past.     This work is a must for anyone interested in boundless possibilities that arise from hallucinogenic substances.  The fact that Huxley is a very intelligent scholar as well as a gifted writer allow him to tackle a difficult subject and tell it in words that lend themselves to the initiated.  Those interested in the remote frontiers and the unmapped areas of human consciousness would do well to read this.    *Side note: The band the Doors took their name from the book.  The title of the book actually refers to a line in the poem The Marriage of Heaven and Hell, written by William Blake in 1793.  \\"If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.\\"       Heaven and Hell      Another rather short essay (about 100 p.) from Huxley in the vain of The Doors of Perception.  In it Huxley takes on the fast unknowns of Mind at Large, examining the basic properties and functions of visionary experience.  This essay is basically a philosophical discourse on the possibilities that exist for visionary experience.  The contrast between the positive and negative experience are characterized in the contrasting realms of Heaven and Hell.  What makes this an incredibly interesting read is that all arguments made are based on plausible grounds and quite often on scientifically sound grounds.  Although written over a half century ago, this work has proved a classic that stands out in a field that is still insufficiently investigated.  Together with The Doors of Perception, Heaven and Hell shows that Huxley is as much a force in the world of nonfiction thought as he is in fiction.  Read what this man has to say and think about it.  There is a lot there to digest.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Many people I encounter who haven't seen Planet Earth wonder what the big deal is. They wonder what makes the show different from other nature programs. Trying to explain or seeing previews is not enough to make sense of it...which probably makes my review pointless. But I'll keep going anyway. The main aspect of this series is its remarkable camera access and stunning cinematography. The viewer is immersed in worlds that have rarely been seen by human eyes (and not in a cliche kind of way). Planet Earth also delivers a deeply emotional component that allows viewers to connect with the animals and their circumstances in a fashion similar to human dramas. It also shows the preciousness of our environment and how our actions affect beings we rarely see or even know exist. Is it much better seeing Planet Earth in high definition? Sure, but that pretty much applies to anything.
0385522401|4.0|This concisely written novella explores the tragic impact of  sexual problems experienced by a pair of young newlyweds in the early 60's. The strength of the story is in the description of the characters' backgrounds; these are interesting good people you can care about.   The depiction of sex on their wedding night is clinical, almost voyeristic, not sensual, but it provides the details needed to understand the problem as it unfolds.     The author implies that we should be greatful for the sexual revolution, as being unable to discuss sexual problems, not even having the vocabulary to do so, led to this  tragedy. Perhaps. But aren't people still struggling with sexual intimacy? (A look at spam mail would say yes.)  Also, in the 60's they would be more likely to continue a marriage and avoid sex. Dissolving a marriage because of sex problems would be considered selfish, unacceptible.   The story of such a marriage would be longer and even more tragic.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|The songs that really appeal to me are Bleed it Out and What I've Done.  Some of the other songs just don't quite fit.  In other words, the calmer, ballad-type songs are alright, but what happened to Shinoda on this album?  I wanted a better mix/use of Shinoda and Chester.

B0007SMD3W|4.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />In the beginning (1969), there was the first Genesis record.  The gentleman they call Phil was nowhere to be found.  The drums were courtesy of John Mayhew.  The guitar was not Steve Hackett but a young Anthony Phillips.<br /><br />While the prototypical sound would not be born until October 1970's \\"Trespass\\", the band's offering of a mix of some Moody Blues and the Bee Gees \\"Odessa\\" should never have been maligned from various critics of the past.<br /><br />You don't compare this record to other ones by Genesis.  You judge it on its own merits.  While Peter Gabriel and company were in search of the perfect note and direction, they weren't devoid of an early vision.<br /><br />\\"When The Sour Turns To Sweet\\" is a wonderful opening track and there is no better way to enjoy the days of yesteryear then with this version of the first recording.  The bonus tracks of singles and unreleased material give you a plethora of tasty treats to sink your teeth into.  Anthony Phillips guitar sounds as if it he is strumming in your living room.  This is the best fidelity yet!<br /><br />\\"The Serpent\\" is a tune with a haunting musical path.  An attention grabber and a strong composition.<br /><br />\\"In The Wilderness\\" drops a bit of 60's psychedelia at your door.  Gabriel sounds convincing as he delivers the vocals.<br /><br />\\"The Conqueror\\" is a more upbeat rocker.  Many find this an immediate choice cut the first time out.<br /><br />\\"In Hiding\\" is a well-crafted vocal by Gabriel.  There is no hoarseness in his presentation.  The smooth delivery is worth a few listenings.<br /><br />\\"The Silent Sun\\" mixes the Moody Blues and Bee Gees sound of the times and pays nice homage to both.<br /><br />The first time you hear the CD listen to it straight through.

B000093FLA|5.0|A very funny movie with an amazing Brad Pitt as a Gipsy boxing champ. The storyline is great, and the movie never had a dull moment. The director keeps your attention by leading the audience through the story with video clip styled movie scenes. The actors themselves play accordingly, so after watching the movie you'll end up with a big smile on your face.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|Like most people, I watched this movie mainly just because of the impressive star power of the cast. (Which, in our celebrity obsessed culture, is probably just as good a reason to watch a movie as any). And it is quite an impressive cast: Leonardo Dicaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and directed by Martin Scorese....Now is that a cast or what? And I know that usually in movies with too many big names somebody ends up being under-utilized, but I thought all the main actors in this movie were given at least a couple great scenes to chew the screen up.    Some researching on the internet reveals that this movie is an American remake of the Hong Kong flick \\"Infernal Affairs\\". (I've not seen \\"Infernal Affairs\\", but I've seen the previous at least. It always looked kind of interesting.)    \\"The Departed\\" is set in Boston and revolves around the Irish-American culture and the Irish mafia. It doesn't come close to the level of pyscho-analysis that \\"The Godfather\\" did for the Italian mafia, but there are various throw away lines referencing the Irish-American experience: \\"Twenty years after an Irishman could't get a job, we had the presidency. May he rest in peace.\\"    The plot gets a little complicated but basically Jack Nicholson is a Irish Mafia boss. Leonardo DiCaprio is an undercover cop infiltrating the mafia. Matt Damon is an undercover mafia who has infiltrated the police department. As the movie progresses various betrayals and changes of allegiance follow.    I don't want to give away too much to anyone who hasn't seen this movie, but at various points I thought it should have been obvious who the respective moles were. And it seemed like everyone was getting pretty sloppy and getting away with it. But that's Hollywood for you I guess.    Also (and again, I hope I'm not giving too much away here. Spolier alert) the climax of the movie revolves around a taped conversation. You know, it turns out that something one of thecharacters said was being tape recorded and he didn't know it, and he said a lot of self-implicating things. Like we've seen a million other times in a million other movies and TV shows.    I suppose this is the most obvious way to end a story like this (which is why it's been used so many times before), but perhaps because it is the most obvious it is also the laziest. For my two cents I would liked to have seen a more interesting ending.    But the movie definately held my attention for the time I was watching it.
B00000JGHM|5.0|So far I have not been dissapointed by anything directed by Michael Mann. This is an outstanding movie with a complete 5 star cast. Anyone who enjoys gritty, crime dramas and armed robbery should see this movie. Mann shows both sides of the coin(especially in the greatest scene of the movie where Pachino, the cop, has a face to face conversation with De Niro, the crook). A definite must have for movie collectors
B000051WDX|5.0|What can I possibly add to the praising wording that the majority of these reviewers already have put forth? Well, I would simply just like to say that I believe that this movie has a very rare quality. It is very down to earth in a natural and liberating way and is basically just a story about this old man who wants to make up with his brother, which he haven't seen for ten years, before its to late.    He has no drivers license and not much money, so he decides to make the long journey across America, on an old lawn mover - and as one discovers along the way, he has really made up his mind to fulfil his decision - and that even in spite of many of the peoples kind help, which includes an offer to drive him to his destination - because as I see it; that there is almost an symbolic meaning to his way of doing it, which you'll find out at the very end of the film.    Sounds boring??? Anything but... this is simply beautiful and a great and very different effort from director David Lynch. This film is almost magical in its simplicity and complete matter of course. Just check it out for yourself. If you enjoyed \\"Round About Smith\\" - well then this film could appeal to you, although that there really isn't any directly comparison.
B0000028P8|3.0|I bought this CD because I wanted to see how these modified arrangements would be since you all said that this CD was God's gift. It isn't. I can't really sit through the whole thing but it definitely isn't a total waste. The worst track here is definitely Emotions. I just wasn't feeling it much.    Make It Happen, I'll Be There and Can't Let Go are the best. But the rest is just OK. And I definitely can't say that any of these songs can stand up to the originals (besides I'll Be There, it IS an original debut) And this verison of Emotions wasn't too good. And like her first CD it's OK, but overrated.    Listen to the samples first, buyers!

0743289684|4.0|As a person who has had the privelidge of knowing many friends who are Muslim, I read this book with some hesitancy as to what they might think if they discovered that I was reading it. I'm glad I read it, regardless of what they might think. There are not many women like Ms. Ali in this world, especially a woman who was born in Somalia and raised in Saudi Arabia and Kenya, who grew up with a powerful and overbearing Muslim family who has decided to dedicate her life into working for the very things that Islam opposes. Ms. Ali has been the focus of much debate since her recent climb to political power in the Dutch parliament (she has sinced resigned) and her creation of the move \\"Submission: Part 1\\" which explored 4 stories of oppressed Muslim women. Her partner in making the film, Theo van Gogh, was murdered mercilessly in November of 2004 by an extremist Muslim.  <br />  <br />Ms. Ali criticizes Islamic society for its sexism, its hatred towards the \\"other\\" people of the world, and its neglect to better itself. If you are an open minded thinker, dedicated to education and the freedom of speech, I recommend this book to all. Read it and be inspired by a woman who has had great courage and integrity to overcome unbearable hardships (including her own excision at the age of 5) and to try and make a positive change in the world--especially in the lives of the oppressed Muslim women.
B000E33VWW|5.0|The film Capote is for me a masterpeice. I don't waste my time reviewing a film that has not earned five stars. Why should I? The only time I would do that is when a film with no redeeming qualities at all was number one at the box office and that is rare,if ever an occasion. First of all the acting of the man playing Truman Capote, Phillip Seymore Hoffman is some of the best art of acting ever produced. Stella Adler is having an orgasm in her grave, I hope. Secondly the casting was brilliant right down to the school girls in Danny Birk's school. The only thing I think might have been misleading is that Truman Capote visited this town in Kansas two weeks after the murders but that is irrelevant. I've had the pleasure to drive through Kansas and that Capote even picked this place to write a book about says alot about his eye for the reality that was America in 1959. After he wrote that book he was nothing other than a standard guest on the Merv Griffin Show and nothing more. But I think people were jealous of him because he wasn't affraid to portray America as it really was and still is. He died a lonely, alcoholic, drug addicted homosexual. Those were his own words. But he died showing us a picture of ourselves that few of his intelligence and talent have the courage to do. And I would bet that sometime in the future such circumstances will happen again and when they do there will be a man who gives his physical and mental self to tell the story for the rest of us to learn something. I hope so. Kevin Bodenhammer  Berlin Germany
B000000XB9|5.0|This is an excellent compilation of CCR's tunes from the late 60s, early 70s.  There's a reason why Credence tunes kept popping up in movies and commercials.

B000PTYP7U|4.0|Now, don't let the title of this review fool you; Paramore is one of my favorites if not my FAVORITE band right now. their debut album \\"all we know is falling\\" had everything:catchy songs, aggressive songs, and then emotional songs.     Paramore's sophmore album is definitely worth buying, especially for the low price. I suggest the Best Buys version if you're thinking about going out and  buying it [it has the most bonus songs, which in my opinion are better than some of the albums main songs]. However, \\"RIOT!\\" has such a broad range of emotions that it's hard to really get into a mindset while listening. Some songs are too slow for my taste (When It Rains) while others seem to be too pop-oriented (crushcrushcrush). Regardless, they are catchy.     Another complaint of mine is that the band has utilized synthetic sounds too much on this album. While i can't remember any real synthesizers in their first album, synthesized sounds are often used (born for this, crushcrushcrush, etc).     Despite it's downfalls, Paramore still does a lot of things right. For a Pessimist I'm Pretty Optimistic, Misery Business, Let the Flames Begin, and Born for this, as well as the bonus songs Stop This Song are all very aggressive and catchy and Hayley's voice really shines.     Whereas every song on \\"All We Know is Falling\\" was filled with memorable songs, \\"Riot!\\" has some do-overs.
0765316978|5.0|I just finished reading this book, and I am suffering from \\"book hangover.\\" The author flawlessly creates another world, and I do not want it to end. I read the first two books in this series, and I have found each to be very different in tone, content, and level of action. Nevertheless, I loved all three, individually. I was engaged by the characters, John Perry and Jane Sagan. The plots are very clever, with many unexpected twists. The action is riveting. There is always some great humorous passages and relationships that are moving. The science fiction is engrossing. I hope John Scalzi reconsiders his decision to end this series and instead brings these characters back in many more books.
1401302378|4.0|In his book \\"The Long Tail,\\" Chris Anderson insightfully presents the foundation of some new-age (mostly ecommerce) companies whose businesses are designed (intentionally or accidentally) to more deeply penetrate the consumer base.  The expansion of product and content due to \\"unlimited shelf space\\" allows companies to service a greater number of consumers and harvest a larger portion of revenue from smaller and niche markets.  This is Anderson's basic premise of The Long Tail.  He paints very broad strokes at first, but his theories become extremely clear as he applies them to companies like eBay, iTunes and Google.    It's a good and important read for any businessman and it will definitely provoke your thoughts.  How can my company better penetrate these niche markets?  How can my company take advantage of digital distribution?  How can my company integrate many of the cost saving advantages of the internet?  How can I adapt my business and protect it from progressive consumerism (see entertainment industry).    Buy it, read it, learn it.  These are principles that are going to be a bigger part of our lives as consumer behavior continues to march toward an online world.    Have fun,    David Tobias  Redondo Beach, CA

1594489505|3.0|Some authors write such beautiful, exquisite prose that they can hold the reader in rapt attention writing on almost any subject; think, for example, of John McPhee's \\"Oranges\\", or almost any of Mark Helprin's fantastic tales. Others capture the readers attention by telling a story so riveting, so real, that the reader is compelled to read on, just to discover what happens next.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini has a writing style that is spare and simple, yet elegant and finely crafted, and well suited to telling such tales. In The Kite Runner, he constructed a story that was alien, and yet familiar, with rich characters and settings that drew the reader in. HIs newest novel, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" begins similarly, painting a picture of Mariam, a young girl, the product of an assignation between a wealthy man and her now poor and discarded mother, an outcast in her village for her past sins. As Hosseini tellls it, the reader can almost close his or her eyes and see the village and the people, feel the heat, and smelll the aroma of the cooking.<br /><br />Not long after we meet Mariam, her mother dies and she is quickly married off to an older buisnessman, and at that point the character of the narrative shifts rather abrubtly. Gone is the lyrical story line, replaced by what is best described as a rather disapppointing, hackneyed potboiler of the sort that you expect to see featured on Oprah's Book Club. Mariam is repeatedly abused, physically and emotionally, and treated like the heroine of a Sweet Savage romance novel. At this point the author lost me, but I plowed ahead, through Mariam's various humiliations, and to the point where her husband takes a second wife, a younger girl named Laila. By then it's pretty obvious that (1) they're going to struggle together against their husband, (2) that Mariam will sacrifice herself for her younger \\"sister\\", and (3) the younger girl will realize Mariam's dreams, and so on.<br /><br />Whereas \\"The Kite Runner\\" had the flavor of authenticity- these were real people, living real lives- \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" rings false. It is a cliched, contrived story, with contrived characters. Hosseini is not a young Afghan bride, and he simply cannot convince me when he writes Mariam's internal monologue. The book has a contrived flavor, and worse, the feeling that it was written with a film in mind. I do wish that Hosseini would go back to writing from his own experiences and turn out another masterpiece like \\"The Kite Runner.\\"r of authenticity- these were real people, living real lives- \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" rings false.

His molten guitar can still fry your ears even forty years down the road, and Rod Stewart's raspy, blues- and soul-inflected vocals have few peers in rock & roll.

B000022TSV|2.0|This film version of the great Bizet opera aims for gritty realism right from the start - during the opening credits a bull is impaled and killed during a bull-fight - of course this realism goes out the window as soon as the characters open their mouths and begin to sing!<br /><br />This is a well-mounted and well-sung production but the juxtaposition of a realistic setting with the artifice that is opera just doesn't work. The cast are not helped by the obvious lip-synching especially noticable during close-ups. The limitations of the singers as actors are also ruthlessly exposed.<br /><br />Lovers of the vibrancy and passion of Bizet's great opera are best advised to look elsewhere.

B00002MZ4V|4.0|John Willams' film music is of such high quality it still holds up away from its source material.<br /><br />Williams not only has the talent to write memorable melodies but to expertly interpolate themes from the story into his scores, for example the drum rolls in \\"JFK\\" evoking the president's funeral procession and the mournful bugle calls in \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\".<br /><br />Williams also employs a variety of styles, but never gratuitously, always to the service of the film. His \\"Jaws\\" theme is as legendary as the violin shrieks from Bernard Herrman's famous score for \\"Psycho\\".<br /><br />The performances are excellent - only the \\"Born on the Fourth of July\\" performance exposes some thinness in the string section of the Boston Pops Orchestra.<br /><br />There is much to enjoy here for film and music lovers alike.
1596912855|4.0|* If you love Jane Austen novels, this book is for you.<br />  * If you love the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice and think Colin Firth is the BEST EVER Darcy, this book is for you.<br />  * If you enjoy a lighthearted romance that you would not be embarrassed to share with your mother or your daughters, this book is for you.<br />  * If you are currently sewing period dresses for a daughter who has become involved in English Country Dancing and making note of how most of the fullness in Regency style empire waisted skirts is at the back at of the dress to allow for a smooth profile from the front, this book is for you.<br /><br />Jane Hayes feels like she is a loser at love. She has the DVD of the BBC miniseries 'Pride and Prejudice' which she pulls out when she needs a shot of Mr. Darcy. She longs for the romantic connection of an Elizabeth Bennet-and-Fitzwilliam Darcy sort in her own life.<br /><br />She is bequeathed a trip to a \\"Jane Austen World\\" in England, by a great-aunt. Pembrook Park lets the \\"campers\\" live and breathe 18th century England, complete with elegant gowns, etiquette and diversions. Jane decides this is her opportunity to purge herself of her Darcy neediness by immersing herself in the fantasy. She IS a 21st century person at heart though, so as she becomes accustomed to corsets and dresses that are not conducive to exercise, there is a part of her that holds back. In her heart she knows the \\"gentlemen\\" are actors but that does not keep her from wishing for a true romance.<br /><br />I enjoyed Jane's ability to match the events at Pembrook Park to the plots and characters from Jane Austen's novels. The book's style does not swerve to the biting humor of Bridget Jones but it is an entertaining and fun summer read. No one can \\"do\\" Jane Austen. 'Austenland' is Shannon Hale's curtsy to the master.<br /><br />I listened to audio version of the book because of my schedule. I enjoyed it but I am also looking forward to going back and actually reading it, which is something I rarely do.ly do.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|How I met your mother is HILARIOUS, and is some of the best comedic writing on tv right now! Think friends, but in a bar, not a coffee house.  The characters are witty, and there is a creative banter. It also has a continuity to the show that comedy's don't often have. Lily and Marshall are the romantic couple in the show, and have the cutest relationship!  The story is told by Ted, as he narrarates the story of how he met his children's mother. It's a true gem, and will have you laughing!
006074815X|5.0|Ken Follet is a master of suspense and great story telling. In Eye of the Needle he is at his best. The characters are gritty and compelling, the action is breath-taking, and the lesson in WW2 history is astounding. That the largest, most complex military invasion ever contemplated came so close to being exposed and, thus, failing, is a lesson we must never forget. Even though you know how the war came out, you don't know how THIS STORY will come out and that's what makes Follett the master of his craft. If suspenseful historical fiction set in WW2 is what you're looking for, read this book. Then, as soon as you finish it, go right out and get [[ASIN:1590131363 Night of Flames: A Novel of World War II]]by Douglas W. Jacobson. You won't be able to put that one down either.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have been a Bond fan for nearly 30 years now. I've seen many Bonds come and go and have appreciated what each actor has brought to the role.    When I heard Daniel Craig had been cast as 007, I had my doubts. I had seen him in Layer Cake and Road to Perdition and felt that he really didn't LOOK the part. I know that looks can be deceiving. Case in point is Michael Keaton in 1989's Batman. I thought that was the worst casting decision in the history of film.....until I SAW the movie. Keaton ended up being PERFECT in the role.    The same goes for Craig. Daniel Craig is masterful as James Bond. Many of the Daniel Criag detractors felt that Craig portrayed bond as an unrefined thug.    That was the point of the whole film. Remember, Casino Royale is bringing the Bond franchise back to its roots. Bond has just become a \\"00\\" and isn't the seasoned agent that we've all come to know and love over the years.    Yes, Craig's Bond is brutish. If you notice, in many scenes he doesn't wear a suit and tie (except for the casino scenes) and even goes around with his shirt untucked in some cases. He's certainly not the dapper British agent in all of the previous films.    Also, when asked if he wanted his vodka martini shaken or stirred, he responds that he doesn't give a damn. What? Again, remember, he is unrefined and unseasoned, not a suave, sophisticated super-spy.    Now. Fast forward to the end of the film when the villain behind it all asks him \\"Who are you?\\"    We see Bond dressed to the nines in a fantastic suit and tie as he replies \\"Bond. James Bond.\\"    That sums it all up. Bond is seasoned now. He's been through a lot and knows that he's got to \\"tighten up\\" if he's going to survive as a \\"00\\".    The next film, which I am greatly looking forward to, will most likely show a more sophisticated, cultured and refined Bond. He may still have some rough edges (he can't become a brute one day and a perfect gentleman the next; that proess should take a little time), but he should be closer to the traditional Bond we've all known since the '60s.    One thing I REALLY appreciated was the story. Previous Bond films have been extremely outrageous (Die Another Day: a hotel sculpted out of ice, a villain with a \\"shock suit\\", an invisible BMW, an evil henchman named Mr. Kill.....puh-lease!) This story is better rooted in reality than some of the other Bond films which I think brings more credibility to the franchise. I think we're all getting a little tired of the \\"master villain wants to cause a nuclear war and dominate the world\\" theme. That type of story has been done to DEATH.    As for the DVD itself, the extras are good but not great. It was nice, though, for Myram D'Abo (Kara from The Living Daylights) to interview the Bond girls through the ages; a very nice, nostalgic touch.    The picture is excellent and the sound is very good although not top-notch. I found some of the dialogue difficult to hear, so I turned up the volume. When the action scenes came, I had to turn the volume back down because the movie then became way too loud.    Overall, an excellent purchase and an excellent film. Even if you're not a James Bond fan, you will still enjoy this movie.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I've got more and more respect for Christian Bale the more I see his movies.  This one is excellent.
B00005JPPL|2.0|The basic concept of the film, that Nicholas Cage was born with the ability to see 2 minutes into his own future...and can thus affect the outcome of the future...is kinda fun.  That he has become a cheesy Vegas lounge-entertainer / mind-reader in order to elude the notice of the government is just unusual and plausible enough to amuse.  It's funny to see Cage on a chintzy stage, performing really bad mind-reading tricks.    But we see these things in the first five minutes of the film...and it is straight downhill from there.  It's hard to say enough bad things.    Let's start with Cage himself.  He can be a superb screen actor...over the years I've loved him in RAISING ARIZONA, MOONSTRUCK, LEAVING LAS VEGAS and especially ADAPTATION.  He was charming in PEGGY SUE GOT MARRIED.  He brought solid quirkiness to THE ROCK and even the underwhelming NATIONAL SECURITY.  But he is on a huge loosing streak right now...GHOST RIDER was pretty bad, but WICKER MAN was laughable, and now NEXT allows him to reach absolute rock bottom.  It's hard to imagine an actor looking less interested or engaged in his work.  His hang-dog demeanor and droopy eyes now just simply make him look asleep.  He also has really bad hair...it makes Tom Hanks in DAVINCI CODE look positively stylish.  It is long and black...like bad spray-paint black...the type of hair-dye that community theaters buy at Walgreens.  And his skin has a thick layer of the most unconvincing \\"tan\\" foundation I've seen in a movie since the days of STAR TREK TOS.  He looks, frankly, like a man who is dying of a wasting disease and is trying to cover it.  I mostly worried for Nicholas Cage's health watching NEXT.  He's just hard to watch.    Julianne Moore is just wasted.  She's been making some pretty poor choices lately...I guess the good roles she had been getting for awhile have run out.  I think back a few months to CHILDREN OF MEN...a movie I LOVED...and I remember even then thinking the tough, action-minded thing was nother strong suit.  Now I'm convinced of it.  She is a tough woman, but needs to play it with an edge of fragility.  That's what has always made her interesting.  She flounders a bit in underwritten, generic roles.  Jessica Biel, who helped her case as an actress with THE ILLUSIONIST, fails to convince in her silly role as a sensitive, unassuming young woman who teaches in the Native American villages around the Grand Canyon.  There are also ZERO sparks between her and Cage...but that's more the fault of bad writing and bad Cage.    The plot goes from a trifling amusement to just plain ridiculous.  There are one or two good ideas...such as late in the film when Cage sends himself in many directions at once to see where the bad guys are hiding.  It's a rare moment of marginal originality.  The action sequences are few and far between.  The special effects are also fairly lame.  If you saw the previews for the movie and saw the huge explosion...that's it!  It made the film look almost like a disaster movie, with some expectation that the little snippet of film we saw was just a clip from more ambitious scenes of destruction.  Nope...you saw it ALL.    Anyway, I've spent too much time on such a forgettable movie.  Do not see NEXT.  Simple as that.

B000NVT0RU|5.0|'Indig&egrave;nes' (DAYS OF GLORY) as written by Olivier Lorelle and Rachid Bouchareb (who also directed) is a film of visceral power, another aspect of World War II that has not been addressed and that points to problems of inequality among fighting troops that still exists. It is a grisly film (how can a film about war not be?) but shares a viewpoint that is as shocking as it is important.<br /><br />During WWII the French military incorporated African men including a large number of Algerian soldiers to fight the Nazis and protect France (and, yes, its protectorates) from oppression. The story focuses on four of these Algerian soldiers who leave their homeland to fight for the ideals of France yet are victims of discrimination and inequality of treatment and advancement, even when they are selected to perform the most hazardous of duties. The men vary from idealist to illiterate but their sense of camaraderie is rock solid: Saïd Otmari (Jamel Debbouze) is unable to read or write and has only one arm, yet he is devoted to his mission of saving France and hence his family in Algeria; Yassir (Samy Naceri) proves to be a marksman and is the one selected to be front man during the most dangerous encounters; Messaoud Souni (Roschdy Zem) finds solace in the love of a French girl Ir&egrave;ne (Aur&eacute;lie Eltvedt) but his communications with her are censured by the military; Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila) is the natural leader among the four yet is not advanced in rank when the Frenchmen are. The only non-Algerian who is supportive of these men is Sergeant Roger Martinez (Bernard Blancan) who attempts intervention with the French over the disillusioned Algerians. In many ways the story is related through the reactions of Abdelkader, especially the heartbreaking ending.<br /><br />It is the final act of courage when these four men are assigned to assist the American forces in Alsace, an assignment so devastatingly dangerous that no other French forces would accept, that the love and devotion of these men is supremely tested. And as the fragile victory over the Nazis is claimed by the French, we see the last of the Algerian quartet walk unnoticed and uncelebrated through the freed Alsatian town. If the 60 years later ending of the film is a bit maudlin for some viewers, it still makes a solid statement about the courage of these men, fighting for a 'motherland' that all but ignored them. And the story is true!<br /><br />The battle scenes are realistic, the acting is first caliber, and the production values are excellent, including the cinematography by Patrick Blossier and a musical score by Armand Amar and Cheb Khaled that enhances every aspect of a multicultural war. This is a film about WW II that stands with the best of the stories about the physical and emotional atrocities that war produces. In French and Arabic with subtitles. Highly recommended.

0634049011|4.0|This is a great book for learning to really understand the fretboard.  It's pure excercises though.  To me a 5 star book has to have you learning while you also enjoy what you're playing.  A lot of this is rote stuff that you just drill 'til you get it.  The book does pay off though and I recommend it to a serious player willing to put in the time.
B000MXPE7O|3.0|\\"Good Shepherd\\"  is an epic story about Edward Wilson (Matt Damon), a CIA agent in the cold war era of the '60s. The movie goes back and forth in time from the 20s to the 60s starting from Wilson's college days at Yale, where he joins the society of Skulls and Bones and then gets mentored to perform counterintelligence tasks.  The movie is interwoven with multiple flashbacks, which I didnt like and felt wasnt really necessary. Every director has to follow the nonlinear timeline technique these days just to make it look like an \\"intelligent\\" movie. In spite of boasting the best ensemble cast seen in a long time,  the movie is very long and will easily put you to sleep after the first hour. The pacing is just too slow and makes it hard to concentrate for almost 3 hours. With better editing,  \\"Shepherd\\" could have been a front runner at the Oscars.
0316010669|4.0|Blink follows in the footsteps of The Tipping Point. Once again, Malcolm Gladwell gathers up a collection of fascinating tales, linking them together to help illustrate an idea. In Blink, that idea is that our subconscious, in only a few seconds, can make extremely accurate decisions. It's not intuition - Malcolm deliberately does not use the word intuition and explains this at the end of the book. Intuition is about gut, emotional reactions. Instead, Malcolm explains that the blink factor is when our extremely well trained subconscious zips through a decision for us.<br /><br />He gives many examples of how this works. Trained experts looking at a statue can tell immediately it's a forgery. Food experts can nibble an Oreo and tell which factory it was made in. Marriage experts can listen to a couple talk for only a few minutes and predict - with extremely high accuracy - if the pair will survive long term. It's not an emotional response. It's a lightning-fact summary of the training that the individuals have undergone.<br /><br />What then follows is to look at situations which don't involve specific training - i.e. human relationships. Every human, from the time they are born, are immersed in a 24-hour-a-day learning lab of how to get along with others. They learn facial movements, tone of voice, and much more to figure out how to relate to others. Malcolm specifically mentions autism and how individuals with this syndrome lack that skill - and how it affects their daily functioning. So each of us is educated from birth on how to act and react to others - and that becomes a subconscious talent.<br /><br />But is it a good thing? Because we learn and encapsulate all of this without any real conscious thought, we also bring into our brain all the prejudices and slants that are around us. Early in the 1900s, many people were POSITIVE that women could not play instruments as well as men could. Most orchestras were primarily male (with perhaps a female harpist). Even when women auditioned, they were judged to be not as good. Then, for a fluke reason, a set of candidates were auditioned behind a screen, and a female won. Simply by bringing in screens to shield the player's identity during the testing period, many orchestras are now 50% female. No quotas to fill, no arguing with maestros over \\"be more fair\\". They set up the testing so only the music could be evaluated - and suddenly it was.<br /><br />This was a very encouraging message for me. It has to be taken along with the many other depressing messages here. Studies where they sent men and women, black and white, into car dealerships - with the individuals dressed almost identically and presenting the exact same educational background and home street - had the car salesmen treating the white men MUCH better than the black men in terms of price quoted. Even when the sales reps felt they were being fair. It was innate in the rep's \\"sizing up\\" of the person before them, how gullible they were. Other studies with words and photos show that even people who feel they are extremely fair in racial situations still have a built in bias. The studies are in the book, so you can take the tests yourself and see how you do.<br /><br />Still, the first step in overcoming an issue is to know it is out there. If your subconscious is having you make a snap decision about someone you meet, it's good to be aware that is going on and to take steps to fix it. I really wish the book had gone more into that phase. It's fine to list example after example of snap judgements and how they can be bad and good. But if you lay them out and say \\"these exist and it's important to understand and guide them\\" - the logical next step would be to talk about HOW to do those things. The book leaves you hanging.<br /><br />Maybe Malcolm has plans for a third book, and figures everyone who read book 2 would then be required to get book 3 ...hen women auditioned, they were judged to be not as good.

0743289684|4.0|Although I found the personal story in this book a trifle long, the clear messages about the tenets of the Muslim faith and its practices are very striking and stark. Ms. Ali's statement clarifies what the West is up against in the war on terror. She emphasizes the corruptness of governments in Muslim countries and that the contrast for the population is a 'brotherhood' of fundamentalists who are not corrupt, provide social services and education.  It is that government corruption in near-failed states that has given credibility to the Jihadists and the Muslim fascists. And, it is clear from this book, they know how to tweak the media and images very well to recruit, captivate, and hold their followers.            But, the book also shows that the fundamentalist Muslim fascist movement is false in many respects.  For instance,they cannot call for the holy war they claim as their own.  Only the Prophet Muhammad can call for holy war (p. 179).            The topical issues of our time really kick in on p. 230 when Ali talks about the effect of Muslim repression.  Ali also takes on the flaws of \\"muilticulturalism\\" showing that tolerating perverse practices of the funadmentalist/traditional Muslim faith ldeads neither to tolerance, nor integration.  Those practices, particularly with regard to the role of women lead not just to oppression, but also a lag in development.            To me, the value of this book is its clear expose of the paradigms of the fundamentalist Muslim faith, and what its consequences are for those who are in its grips.  It is not a pretty picture, and now exposed, should force all Westerners in democratic systems to redouble their efforts to fight the war on terror.  It may be the only thing that saves us from total anniliation/submission.    PLEASE BE ADVISED THAT THIS REVIEW MAY BE ALTERED FROM THE ORIGINAL ONE.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|This is absolutely one of the most original series around. No surprise there because Dexter first appeared in  book form (see link below). If someone had told me I would be riveted by a book written from the viewpoint of a serial killer, well...I would never believe it. But Dexter was almost...loveable and he has a certain morality, believe it or not.<br />  The series is different but I found it equally intriguing and quirky.<br />Here's the real irony in this series: someone who is so far from having normal human traits, who really doesn't understand love or sexual attraction, can reveal insights into what it means to be human in a way that a more stereotypical series doesn't. It is similar to the way the dark parts of paintings illuminate the light, each complimenting the other. Dexter is dark but he isn't simplistic and he has a wry sense of humor.<br />I was pleased that some of what had attracted me to the books managed to get on screen as well, including Dexter's unique humor and a certain presence that resonates from page to film. That pleased me. What is most amazing to me is how this series actually reverberated emotionally and touched my life in ways I never believed possible, considering the focus of the series.<br /><br />  This could have been a flop. It was a brave move to put something like this on the air and I feared (before I saw the first episode) that the depth and complexity of Dexter, hiding beneath that slick, seemingly inhuman surface, would be lost. But my fears were groundless, thank goodnes.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400095921 Dearly Devoted Dexter]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0385518331 Dexter in the Dark: A Novel]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307277887 Darkly Dreaming Dexter]]

The reviewers here leave a confusing picture: some haven't heard this but reviewed it anyway, others are getting it mixed up with Tubular Bells 3, which has different music on it.    I bought this CD after reading reviews here, and was not put off by the supposed fans, crying about remakes (how many times???) etc.   I first got interested in MO from Tubular Bells 2, which has some striking, highly original and beautiful compositions.  They ARE NOT the same as the Tubular Bells original.  In fact, all of Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells works are enough different, that you could own all of them and enjoy each separately for what it is.     Except for TB 2003, which is the grownup modern version of Mike's ideas from 1973.  If this CD had no predecessor, it would be an above-par ambient-rock fusion work that would attract some notice.  If Mike Oldfield decides to redo it to make it better, more power to him.  Don't believe any of the tripe here that it is without soul, etc.  Electronic instruments are used by everybody nowadays, from the pure guys like Ulrich Schnauss, to the major players like Alan Parsons. (Well,except for Tingstadt and Rumbel, and the Chieftains, --both of whom I like a lot--and other acoustically-committed musicians.)    To belittle the guy for wanting to make a version fit for the generations unborn, is to quarrel over territory that doesn't belong to you.  That's what I think, anyway.    This is a 4.5 stars effort, rounded to 5.

B000PFUAO6|5.0|Wow, a new DT album already? These guys are busy. In the past 7 years, DT have shown drastic changes between albums. An orchestral, grandoise, and ambitious double album that was virtually a sound collage of prog rock/metal and tons of other music types (6DOIT), a full-on heavy metal assault (Train of Thought), and a softer, more-proggy album (Octavarium). With Systematic Chaos, we see a continuation of the agressive metal found on Train of Thought. However, this album still isn't as heavy as that one, as there's more melody and smoothness to go with it (Forsaken, Prohets of War). Mike Portony continues his Alcoholics Anonymous Suite (which started with The Glass Prison on 6DOIT) with Repentence (Regret and Resitution), and it seems a new song suite might start, with In The Presence of Enemies Pt1 and Pt2. Only time will tell if they'll contiune this.<br /><br />In an interview, Mike talked about how they wanted to make this album very \\"dramatic and agressive.\\" And it is both those things in many ways. This album can be though of as a combination of Train of Thought and Images And Words. This is DT's first album to include dramatic ballad-like songs with angry heavy metal songs, along with a few that combine both. That said, this is something quite new for DT.<br /><br />The only thing that hasn't really changed is the incredible technicality of the group's musicianship. but would we want it any other way? John and Jordan still have jaw-dropping solos, which more than often interwind with each other. One noticeable change is that Jonh Myung's bass is (finally!!!!) more audible. It's really nice to hear him since he's been kind of under the radar in the past.<br /><br />While Train of Thought and Octavarium were both great albums, there were still a few problems that kept them from being perfect. Train of Thought was a tad too excessive at times, ruining the moment, and on Octavarium, 2 of the songs were a little too poppy and radio-friendly for my tastes. However, on Systematic Chaos, I can't really find anything wrong with it. There are some extremely heavy songs (The Dark Eternal Night) that don't get ruined with excessive playing, and some ballads (Forsaken) that don't get too cheesy. In fact, the only song I've never really been able to listen to all the way through is Repentence, as it gets a bit too tedious at the end, although it's cool hearing guest voices from Corey Taylor (Slipknot [bleh!], Steve Vai, Chris Jericho (wrestler), David Ellefson (Megadeth), Steve Hogarth (Marillion), Joe Satriani, Mikael Akerfeldt (Opeth), Steve Wilson (Porcupine Tree), Jon Anderson (Yes), Neal Morse (Spock's Beard, Transatlantic), and Daniel Gildenlow (Flower Kings )<br /><br />My favorite songs off Systematic Chaos are Forsaken (very irrestible chorus), Prophets of War (another song questioning the moves of our government), and The Ministry of Lost Souls, this one being my personal pick for song of the year. The song tells the story of a man who saves a woman from drowning, but he ends up dying in the process. The lyrics revolve around the woman being unable to live her life with the memory. By far one of DT's best songs to date. A great chorus, lots of passion, and quite catchy despite the song's uninviting title. This is also the 2nd longest song off the album, next to In The Presence of enemies Pt 2.<br /><br />While I thought Train of Thought and Octavarium were great albums, Systematic Chaos is free of the aforementioned flaws that the other 2 had in my opinion. So overall, this is probably my favorite DT album since 6DOIT. I think most DT fans will be pleased with this release, of course, there will always be those annoying, incredibly picky DT fans that can't accept the fact that they can't control DT from traveling into different grounds. Bottom line: If you're a true DT fan, by all means buy this. If you're a whiny purist who's stuck in the '90s still waiting around for another Images & Words, avoid lik the plague.an't really find anything wrong with it.

B0000DJZA5|3.0|As David Goodwin says in his review here, there isn't much different about this album from what most people know about Let It Be - I certainly didn't feel or notice anything dramatically different except a cleaner sound.  Artistically, this was not the Beatles' most outstanding album, but neither is it unlistenable.  It's hard to pinpoint why this album - which is certainly above average in every respect became relegated in the Beatles pantheon.  (NOTE: I give this three stars, but that's based on Beatles standards!)<br /><br />This is the band returning in many ways to its roots, still experimenting with a more American sound, while McCartney is secure in his role as a ballads composer. The jam quality of the sessions (One After 909), hearken back to where the Fab Four were, earlier in their career - and yet, seem out of place.  Only McCartney sounds polished.  John's standout track is Don't Let Me Down, and Get Back remains a rock classic in the vein of Back in the USSR.<br /><br />It isn't an uneven album at all, but my guess is that a lack of dynamism in some respects, and the legacy of being the Beatles' final release and a somewhat throwaway effort - has created an uneven legacy for this album.  Not to forget that Let It Be followed an entire slew of concept albums from the Fab 4.  The sweetness of Abbey Road and the intentional disparateness of the White Album and the vividness of Sgt Peppers left Let It Be as a conceptual void of sorts.<br /><br />Let It Be Naked is probably best for completists.  Across the Universe is one of my favourite tracks but the version here is average.  Plus I'm not sure if Paul McCartney's signature pieces - Let It Be and The Long & Winding Road - are really better off without Phil Spector's strings.  Simply because most of us have been listening to those versions for years!  You don't miss the stripped instrumentation on these versions either.  They will likely play in your head as you hear the naked versions.

0374105235|5.0|The most ruthless killers in the world aren't the highly trained members of Delta force or the British SAS. They are normal children put in impossible situations.    In \\"A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier,\\" Ishmael Beah recounts how the civil war that engulfed Sierre Leone in 1990s swept him into the frontlines of fighting at a time when he and his friends barely had the strength to lift an AK-47. And how the soldiers that made him fight didn't see this as an obstacle. They helpfully provided stools so Beah could rest his rifle while he practiced.       Fed a diet of cocaine, marijuana and amphetamines, Beah loses all sense of humanity. Armed with this and a child's belief in his own immortality, Beah becomes the world's most efficient killing machine and never blinks an eye as he machine guns prisoners, civilians, and even a school dance floor filled with boys and girls his own age.     As his account progresses, you realize how extraordinary his story is if only because he is still alive to tell it. To begin with, Beah is the only surviving member of his immediate family after the RUF rebels overrun his home village. While fleeing the rebels with other boys, some make it while others don't. His circle of acquaintances is further whittled down during the fighting itself. Finally, a U.N. truck arrives at his military base and his commander, a self-styled lieutenant, arbitrarily picks Beah out as one of a group of child soldiers who will be sent to Freetown for rehabilitation. And even there, the odds against him are stacked as some of the children drift back to the fighting, obviously lost to mankind.     A reader could see Beah's story as a tale of hope but that would be naive. Instead, it is a story of almost unimaginable cruelty, and the complete collapse of a society into a state of anarchy so deep it is willing to use its own children as assassins. It might be easy to point to Sierre Leone and reassure ourselves that the issue is contained to what amounts to one demented country. Some might even try to say that problem stems from Sierre Leone's own history. But that ignores the fact that child soldiers exist all over the world from Uganda to the plains of Afghanistan to the jungles of Southeast Asia, to Latin America. Too many people have come to the view that children are just another resource to be expended for short-term gains.    What this foretells for the future of these countries seems fairly obvious and isn't reassuring.     Among the groups that Beah has addressed in talks is the U.S. Marine Corps, and it is just a matter of time before we face child soldiers in future wars. For a U.S. soldiers confronting a 12-year-old with dilated pupils and fully loaded AK-47, there won't be any choice. But the consequences, no doubt, will be severe as the misery that found fertile ground in the rainforests of West Africa is visited on other countries.
B000002AH9|5.0|Many reviewers lament time and again that Billie Holiday's last record album, entitled Lady In Satin, is a difficult listen because of Billie's voice had deteriorated. Yes, it is true; her voice had deteriorated quite a bit by 1958 when these ballads were recorded. However, if you listen with your heart and not with your mind, Billie turns in a rather solid performance using her voice as an instrument to inject these songs with her own personal angst and regrets. If the truth be told, Lady In Satin is perhaps one of Billie's very finest recording sets.<br /><br />The CD track set deals often with the theme of unrequited love and love gone awry; and the opening track, \\"I'm A Fool To Want You,\\" showcases Billie's sadness as she laments the fact that she can't help loving a man who could never love her in return. The arrangement by Ray Ellis is rich; and the strings enhance the beauty of this number. Billie sings \\"I'm A Fool To Want You\\" with all the grace of the champion chanteuse she truly was. \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\" features Billie singing about the heartbreak of \\"the blues\\" associated with unrequited love. Billie's excellent diction strengthens her performance. Yes, she may be crying her heart out; but Billie's not fading away quietly.<br /><br />Other gems on this CD include the classic \\"I Get Along Without You Very Well;\\" Billie sings this to perfection and Ray Ellis' arrangement never allows a single superfluous note. \\"You've Changed\\" allows Billie to lament that her lover just isn't the same man she once loved so much; he doesn't love her anymore. The melody strikes me with its beauty and Billie's vocals add great poignancy to \\"You've Changed.\\"<br /><br />\\"I'll Be Around\\" gives Billie another opportunity to explore the pain of how she must wait for a man who she hopes will come to love her someday. Billie's interpretation of \\"I'll Be Around\\" glistens like pure gold and the musical arrangement shines, too. \\"The End Of A Love Affair\\" lets Billie sing of how her apparent happiness is nothing but a mask to hide the deep emotional pain she feels because her man has left her. Billie sings this magnificently; you are bound to be touched by this very pensive and forlorn ballad.<br /><br />The CD version of Lady In Satin allows us the luxury of four bonus tracks. These bonus tracks give us a rare insight into how the album was developed and tweaked to get everything just right before they released it for sale. We get two alternate takes of \\"I'm A Fool To Want You;\\" and there's a fascinating track entitled \\"The End Of A Love Affair: The Audio Story.\\" \\"The End Of A Love Affair: The Audio Story\\" offers us a listen of rarely heard studio chatter and we hear Billie clearly saying to someone \\"I don't know the tune.\\" The orchestra then plays their arrangement for Billie to hear it all the way through so that she can get a better feel for how to deliver \\"The End Of A Love Affair.\\" When Billie does perform this number, she sings a cappella; and you get an excellent example of Billie Holiday's flawless diction. We also get a stereo version of \\"The End Of A Love Affair.\\" Excellent! There is a pause track at the end of the CD, too.<br /><br />The liner notes include rarely seen photos of Billie and Ray Ellis working together; and you get the original liner notes by Irving Townsend. Ray Ellis also contributes a great essay about the making of this album. Phil Schaap goes into detail about the differences between alternate takes of the same songs in his own essay.<br /><br />Billie Holiday remains a legendary chanteuse; and I doubt we'll ever see another female singer quite like her. Billie Holiday sang with all her heart and soul; and her adoring audiences everywhere loved her for it. I recommend this CD for Billie Holiday fans; and people who enjoy classic pop vocals with a subtle jazzy twist will treasure this CD for many years to come.<br /><br />Thank you for everything, Billie Holiday!

B000KJU1MS|5.0|Because of performances like the ones captured here, millions of people became diehard fans of four guys from New York who wore more make-up than your Mom. The shows here capture the band at their zenith. All four original members, all the bombastic power and some great, great rock and roll.   Shortly after the '77 show recorded here, the band began to implode into disco, identity issues and a revolving door policy for guitarists. Yes, they made a brief comeback but greed quickly turned the band into a joke...a tribute band to itself.  There will never be a band like the original KISS again and Kissology is a testament to Ace, Peter, Paul and Gene...the hottest band in the world. Buy this DVD and see us old guys remember KISS so fondly.

Forget dinners, committments, and sleep.....you'll want to get right through the whole set.  I found myself rushing home from work just to catch the next episodes, and suddenly realizing it was again 4 in the morning.....  It also makes you wish our political parties--both of them--could check around and come up with candidates as good as these for the next elections!  Not much chance, but this series at least lets us dream the dream.
0790729369|5.0|A very mediocre, sappy book became a terrific movie.  Mr. Eastwood and Ms. Streep breathe life into their roles, making the characters people you'll care deeply about.  The dilemma Ms. Streep's character has at the end of the movie and its resolution are completely believeable.  There is no right answer; there is only the answer that hurts the fewest number of people.  There isn't one misstep in the entire film. I can watch it over and over.  It never gets old.

0451457994|5.0|Kubrik & Clarke - can't go wrong when they collaborate. Clarke bounced his (always novel) ideas off of Kubrik for the film, which was to be released simultaneously. What resulted was a chilling view of future space discovery and space travel.<br /><br />One point I loved about the book (which one doesn't find in many other books) was the downplay on dialogue. There's not much conversation, just thoughts and descriptions. I don't think many authors could succeed in doing this, but Clarke comes out on top. After all, he is legendary.<br /><br />I was disappointed that HAL 9000 didn't play more of a role though the book. He seemed to be in passing through his death, even though he was clearly an intelligent entity (though lacking wit an attitude). More focus should have been given to the Illinois-borne (boo-yea) AI construct.<br /><br />The ending was a little hard to grasp but, nevertheless, satisfactory.
B000OONTFU|4.0|The pros and cons of the Matrix trilogy have been argued ad nauseum, so I will limit myself to the HD-DVD version.    The transfer to HD of these movies is astounding. The sound is crystal clear and the picture is stunning (in 1080). The reflections caught in Morpheus' sunglasses and the individual clarity of water drops brings these already visually stunning movies to another level.    My nitpick is with certain special effects, notably the bullet-time effect. When transferred to HD the bullet-time effect looks slightly grainy and pixelated compared to the rest of the film.     Nitpicks aside, this is still a very entertaining movie trilogy and the HD experience makes it exponentially better.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|Unless your drumming is better than Mike Portnoy's, you have the creativity, the natural talent, the accuracy, the speed and the songwritting habilities of John Petrucci, or the range or frontman techniques of James Labrie, it's hard to critize DT. My advice is that you should hail Dream Theater as masters of the progressive metal universe and thank god for having this album on your cd player. The Wizard and Myung are also key elements to this great masterpiece. To me this album sounds like a \\"polished\\" and powerful Train of Thought.
1582701709|1.0|I dont get the hype here, this is nothing new and this is no \\"secret\\", the book and the movie are presenting the teachings of witchcraft wrapped in a differnt package.  I think dabbling in energy work can be dangerous, perhaps if i focus my energy on what i want, then i will get it, but perhaps what i get is not what i should have gotten, perhaps the universe knows more than I, perhaps God knows more about what i need than i do, I think the better approach to accept what we are given, there is no harm in having desires, but being greedy and craving money and power, and wanting material possesions so bad that you try and force your will and practice withcraft is obsurd to me, this is only my opinion.
0783225725|5.0|This is Clint Eastwood's first masterpiece as a director.  This was Eastwood's 3rd film (after Play Misty for Me and Breezy), and it still remains one of his best films.  Misty and Breezy are excellent films, but this one is far better than both of them.  Many critics have said this is a tongue in cheek Western.  I digress strongly.  Yes, there are humourous elements in it, but it's a morally complex, eerie, and brilliant piece of filmmaking.  Eastwood's character doesn't really have a name, but this isn't an extension of his work with Sergio Leone.  It has a lot to do with revenge, karma, greed, and what small town America in the west was really like.  It wasn't like the idealised, \\"God-fearing\\" folk (that cliche gets a real takedown in this film) you see in typical Hollywood westerns.  The ending is downright surreal, but it works brilliantly.  Even the supporting players (especially Billy Curtis) are excellent here.  A decent number of Eastwood's films have some bad acting in them in the supporting roles, but here that doesn't happen.  Eastwood shot this masterpiece in 24 days, and under budget too.  This was Clint's first great film.
0307237699|5.0|I read \\"Dreams from my Father\\" and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Obama could easily make a living writing.    Barack Obama is an excellent writer who will hold your attention no matter what he is saying.  His casual style laced with human interest stories makes this book a page turner.  Furthermore, he is right on nearly every issue.  He is intelligent.  Not only does he listen, but he processes incoming information which, as we have discovered, some people do not.    I do have a bone to pick, and I have it to pick with all of modern society.  Article Six of the U.S. Constitution clearly states, \\"...no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust in the United States.\\"  Note the words \\"any\\" and \\"ever.\\"  For a politician to discuss his religious beliefs (or a debate moderator to ask about them) becomes a religious test and panders to those folks who want to abandon American law and tradition when it comes to religion.
B00005YU1O|3.0|I like Richard Linklater more as a person than a filmmaker.  Here is a good example of his work.  The ideas put forth are interesting and necessary, but the film overall is very ponderous, talky (almost all of Linklater's films are talky), pseudo-intellectual (like his generation, Gen X), and kind of boring in spots.  The conversations veer from passable to banal, and the rotoscoping, while interesting, isn't really groundbreaking.  Rotoscoping has been done for quite some time, but it looks better than it used to, because of digital technology.  The film is average.  I like Linklater's intelligence and ambition, and he's very personable in interviews, but his work is usually disappointing.  It's not terrible, but it's not as good as it can be.
B00003CXA2|1.0|This movie celebrates one of the worst possible perspectives on life and does it by exploiting all of the good will and energy of music of the Woodstock generation.  Think about it:  Tom Hanks portrays a pure innocent who presumably is to be seen as an American Buddha -- detached from everything except pure love.  Meanwhile, Robin Wright Penn is portrayed as an idiot because she invests herself in silly causes such as opposing the Vietnam War.  We are manipulated into sympathizing with the figure who remains utterly detached from life instead of the figure who cares about the world around her.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we are further manipulated by a soundtrack carefully assembled so as to have us associate all the good feelings and hopes connected to the songs with what we are watching:  a phenomenal bit of film making that successfully transposes the audiences associations with the highest ideals of the sixties and seventies on a film that belittles commitments to those beliefs.<br /><br />This is a truly insidious, reactionary piece of work.  At the end of the movie, \\"Nashville,\\" Robert Altman cleverly decries the ease by which an audience can be seduced into acquiescing to feel-good nihilism by having everyone leave the theater singing \\"You may say that I ain't free, it don't worry me.\\" with gospel abandon.  The raves that the movie Forest Gump got proves Altman's point.<br /><br />No one can deny that this movie is a well made film with some sweet and wonderful performances.  But, at its core, it is spiritually bankrupt.  While it is not as powerful a film as \\"Triumph of the Will\\" and the \\"philosophy\\" it attempts to manipulate the audience into buying isn't as remotely evil as that of Leni R's patrons, it is nonetheless of that ilk -- a successful attempt to bypass the audience's frontal lobe.
B0000B1OFI|4.0|The Italian Job brings to the screen the story of a group of thieves bent on revenge on one of their own who betrayed them by murdering their leader and running off with the gold.    Mark Wahlberg, Donald Sunderland, Edward Norton, Charlize Theron, Seth Green, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are commendable to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!  In short, The Italian Job is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!
B000MXPE7O|1.0|I kept waiting to see the good part of this movie and it never happened. Too much time line switching and unrealistic in that nobody has ice water in their veins like Damon did. However he typically crawled into bed with anyone who would go.I love a good spy spoof but this one stunk.
0618680004|5.0|What a wonderfully clear mind Richard Dawkins has!  I'm only partway through, but all his statements and arguments so far are cogent and  persuasive, because he never has to defend a point by claiming that it is so because he thinks it is so, or because some organization or mentor told him it is so.  Too bad those who argue in favor of religion can't be so rock-solid in their foundations!    How ironic that the previous writer would find him prejudiced.  That is exactly what he is NOT!  Methinks the writer is so prejudiced that he cannot realize that about himself.    I think I should keep a copy of this book and another, \\"Why People Believe Weird Things\\", to give away whenever I find someone who just can't understand how his or her belief system is skewed.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|After hearing \\"You Don't Know My Name\\", it was like being transported back to the days of classic R&B, and a good example of what a woman should say, when she approaches a man she's interested in; though I'm still not sure how she got his phone number? Then into the relationship, don't be afraid to tell him how you really feel about him, like her \\"If I Ain't Got You\\". Men like to hear that too. But \\"Diary\\" is the most melodic and moving song for me, it's all about the trust someone should feel they have in the one they are committed to. Alicia's in a league of her own when it comes to upholding traditional R&B.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Dream Theater has stolen the show with, \\"Systematic Chaos\\".  An excellent album/cd that should be considered a front runner for the best heavy metal grammy.  It's simply a metal marvel to listen to with so much gifted musical intelligence put forth into this great body of work.  Highly recommended.
078322947X|4.0|This is a dark, brooding film so typical of William Friedkin.  Not his best work, but entertaining nonetheless.  I mean, who else can generate white knuckle suspense at two miles per hour (see the film, and you'll know what I mean).    The best aspect of the film is the intense soundtrack by Tangerine Dream.  Mr. Friedkin once stated if he had known of the existence of Tangerine Dream when he made The Exorcist, he would have selected them for that soundtrack instead of Mike Oldfield.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Let's get this out of the way: Annette Bening (Carolyn) totally steals the show. She shows so many different sides to a human being, especially the extreme. She's super peppy and I almost loved to hate her in the movie. Kevin Spacey was pretty good. He plays a depressed man named Lester who's highlight of the day is pleasuring himself in the shower in the morning. In many ways I could relate to this character. Actually, most of the characters are relate able. Lester and Carolyn have a daughter by the name of Jane. She's pretty mean to her parents and wishes they would just disappear. I liked her character, but Mena Suvari's character was even better. I like the scene where some girl says \\"You're no goddamn Christie Turlington.\\" Her response to that was very funny.<br /><br />The ending was quite exciting with many things going on so I was definitely sad when it was over...I'm glad they never made a part II to it too because they probably would have tainted the name.<br /><br />I left a lot out but I'll just say that if you haven't seen the movie, you really need to. Rent it, buy it, borrow it from a friend; whatever. Just get your grubby paws on it. It shows how beautifully messed up life can be. Bittersweet really. :)

B000P0IW6E|5.0|Just another great cd in the making-I think these guys should have been the ones who played the superbowl instead of the rolling bones.They would have blow those old dinoes'off the stage.The scorps'are renouned thru  the world, when this country seems to be hiding the true rock legends for  some unknown reason.Thru time and time again they write some of the most  inspirational music based on \\"humanity\\".Just remember their one of the best  bands in America and their from germany.

0440236304|5.0|While most young men today are thinking about \\"getting a leg over\\" or what kind of car they should drive, Don Burgett went to war. This is his story.<br /><br />He wanted to join the army at seventeen but his mother balked at the idea. So he filled out a voluntary induction notice and on his 18th Birthday he joined the army. He promptly volunteered for an exciting and new form of combat by joining the paratroopers.<br /><br />This book chronicles the daily life of a man whose body and mind where forged to form one of the finest fighting men this country ever produced. He served as part of the legendary 506h PIR of the 101st Regiment.<br /><br />This book is a priceless gem of American history and a priceless first person account of D-Day from the perspective of a common soldier. It is outstanding in every way. It's an easy read with a gripping story first published in the 1960s.<br /><br />Among the more interesting aspects of this book are the harsh training in Georgia, the pre-assault preparations, and the assault. Burgett's descriptions are vivid and compete including mention of a Japanese officer's body (I'm still trying to figure this one out), bloody bayonet assaults, Germans entrenched in the hedge rows of Normandy, a charge by horseback and ghastly wounds.<br /><br />This book is the real deal. If you only read one first person account of the war, then this is the book to read. I've read the series three times and it never gets old.<br /><br />Mr. Burgett if we ever meet, dinner is on me. Including the Calvados, sir.

B000000OAN|5.0|A Night At The Opera (1975.), Queen's fourth studio album<br /><br />Throughout their career, Queen would always challenge themselves musically and would create a musical spectacle that would win over millions of fans. The band were especially innovative in their early career; powering out a blistering hard-rocking debut with `Queen I' and experimenting with more progressive ideas in `Queen II'. With their third release, `Sheer Heart Attack', the band got everything together to produce a `70's classic. However, the musical train definitely didn't stop there as a year later Queen released `A Night At The Opera'; an album you just may have heard quite a lot of press about over the past 30 or so years...<br /><br />...Indeed, as most reviewers for this album will have stated, this is a seminal hard rock classic and in many ways marks a creative peak in the great career which Queen enjoyed. The album, filled with operatic harmonies and memorable tunes has influenced countless other bands down the years and across the genres. At a first listen, this album strikes you as a crazy operatic charade and in many ways it is! Queen here create an album which is based on the theme of an opera performance with all the crazy twists and turns thrown in. However it works brilliantly and is a truly innovative display that also rocks hard (in some parts at least!). An argument I've often heard with this album is that the whole thing is only made coherant by the one song `Bohemian Rhapsody'. Many agree that the song is the centrepiece of the album. However, I would not hesitate to say that a large number of the tracks stand up on their own two feet. Tracks like `Death On Two Legs' and `You're My Best Friend' are timeless classics in their own right. All in all, `A Night At The Opera' is definitive Queen; there is the pomp, excess, craziness and creative genius all fully featured on this disc. The album also marks a continuation of each member of the band contributing their own material. Brian May's compositions make up the more guitar driven works on the album such as `Sweet Lady' whilst Freddie Mercury contributes the more operatic and quirky songs such as `Seaside Rendezvous', `Love Of My Life' and not to mention the all time famous `Bohemian Rhapsody'. Roger Taylor and John Deacon also leave a clear statement on the album too.<br /><br />`Death On Two Legs' opens this great album. This is one of Queen's best album openers and one of their best songs, period. Written as a cynical tribute to their previous band manager, Freddie Mercury spews venom in the lyrics in an amusing fashion over some great guitar harmonies and melodies from May. The grand piano work, which is synonymous with early Queen is there as well in this blistering opener too. `Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon' is next; a catchy one minute song with some amusing lyrics. There is more piano and overblown guitar lines and as a listener you can feel the operatic stylings in the album building. Then, enter Roger Taylor for `I'm In Love With My Car'. I've always been a big fan of the Roger Taylor songs in the Queen catalogue and this one is no exception. This song rocks hard and Taylor gives a great vocal performance, expressing his love for his car. `You're My Best Friend' is a beautiful song; John Deacon, the quiet man of the band really pulls out the stops in this song of his. A timeless Queen classic, the keyboards work a treat and Freddie Mercury delivers some fantastic emotive vocals. `'39' is an excellent semi-acoustic song about a couple being split up due to the beginning of World War II. `Sweet Lady' is another really cool song. With it's waltz like rocking guitar riff and strong vocals, this is a strong closer to the first half of the album.<br /><br />`Seaside Rondezvous' keeps the operatic nature of the album going. The song has the excess and hilarity which a number of the tracks on the album exhibit and it again works a treat. `The Prophet's Song' is the epic of the album, clocking in at 8 minutes. Here we see what the sound Queen pioneered is all about, there are vocal harmonies and operatic squeals galore in this one. Although the track is a littel drawn out in parts, there is no denying the significance of this particular song. `Love Of My Life' is a Queen fan favourite; a calm and serene song, Freddie gives another brilliant vocal performance in this excellent ballad. `Good Company' is another amusing song, this time a Brian May composition. May performs the vocals and plays the ukelele to create a unique sounding song which I personally think is great. Next is a track I need not say too much about. `Bohemian Rhapsody' is a track everyone knows, whether you know this album or not - it is 6 minutes of pure craziness and genius. For it's time, it was the most expensive single ever made - the number of vocal layers on this song show this. Following this masterpiece, the album closes with Brian May rockin' out to the tune of `God Save The Queen'. Again we see the opera theme and Queen's joking around it, as operas traditionally had the song played at them after a performance.<br /><br />`A Night At The Opera' is definitive Queen. If you want a showcase of what Queen is all about then this is the album to get hold of. The vast praise this album has been given over the years is completely deserved and this album is a milestone album in music. `A Night At The Opera' has aged extremely well and as aware as everyone is that this album dates back to '75, it still sounds fresh and lively. This album and it's predecessor `Sheer Heart Attack', for me marked the creative peak for Queen. This album is a must for any rock fans collection or for any fan of great music in general.<br /><br />MY RATING: 9.5/10see what the sound Queen pioneered is all about, there are vocal harmonies and operatic squeals galore in this one.

1857988094|5.0|I was introduced to Richard Matheson much later than I was introduced to Stephen King and other horror ginuises. I have to say unfortunately. Reading \\"I am legend\\" put in me in the classic driver's seat of horror fiction. It's like riding that old first mustang ever manufactured. Lay back and stir the wheels and inhale the early original dust of horror.<br />Richard Matheson writes simply, arguably not the best writing. But it just overtops the many years of everything we have read. Other than this being like the original thought provoking idea of vampires, a man against the world, a wolrd where only one human is left to fight for survival, it's a spine chilling a much more believable and tasty story than numerous horror fictions lately. Think about alll these new adventure games like Silent hill and that stuff, where did come from? What do you think? Think about Vanilla Sky the movie? and much more<br />This is an original everlasting theme. Human against inhuman. Alone with his fears to confront. Having to find solution to survive even when it is for some more hours. Finding that inhuman enemy are smart and not jut dorky slow crumbling zombies.<br />I think I am legen the phrase, does not go to the protagonist of the book after all of these years.<br />Richard Matheson is THE LEGEND.

B00005JPQP|2.0|Just as I expected after seeing Ocean's 12. But I had to please my wife to sit throuh 2 hours of frustration. This movie really sucks big time. The story is boring and the humor is corny. When the action starts to happen, within 10 minutes the movie ends. You can rent this DVD later on when there's nothing else to watch. Thank goodness for DVD, otherwise we'll soon pay $20 for each movie, while these celebrities compete each other by getting millions of dollars for stupid films like this.
B000F1IQNM|2.0|At 99 minutes, Nanny Mcphee is a light and ultimately forgettable children's film. It had great potential, including a cast of the British luminaries Colin Firth and Emma Thompson, and a good deal of charm and heart, but ultimately failed to deliver on two of its most important attributes: plot and the Nanny. Nanny Mcphee, as a modernized, Willy-Wonka version of Mary Poppins, fails miserably, the worst part being that she's actually frightening. Mary Poppins, as played by Julie Andrews, was strict and firm and occasionally a little frightening, but NEVER cruel. Emma Thompson's nanny is not averse to bringing one of the children to near-death to make sure that they get the point. By the time the little boy has been lifted away from the boiling oil, the children have got the point: Nanny McPhee is boss, and so has the audience; we don't like her. As a \\"comedic\\" replacement for Mary Poppins, Nanny McPhee is unfunny, ugly, and burdened with a ridiculous buck tooth and a decidedly odd manner. She is mysterious rather than magical, inhuman rather than \\"practically perfect\\", and the plot has the vague feeling of something stretched over too little material. There is a good deal of charm, mostly provided by the children carrying out a series of predictable but highly amusing pranks to drive their prospective step-mother away and by a really beautiful love story that develops in the last 5-10 minutes of the film, and great cinematography, but this only partially cancels out the genuinely creepy parts and the frothy lack of plot. In the end, this is a decent family film, but hardly a classic.
B000002UB3|5.0|One of the many great things about the Beatles is that you can make a legitimate argument for most of their albums as \\"the best record they ever made\\" I have a friend who would say the white album, my best friend thinks its Sgt. Pepper, another who says Revolver, and so on. But for me, it is Abbey Road hands down. Great Great album that inspired a generation of artists. All the songs are awesome, and the final 20-25 minutes of the album is some of the greatest music ever recorded in my opinion.
B00005ONMJ|5.0|I'm a dyed-in-the-wool opera fanatic and replaced my old VHS of this same performance with the new DVD.  It's wonderful.  This performance was not idolized in Salzburg for nothing - it's simply the best.  Every one of the main characters was in top form and the sets and stage direction are just stunning.  Siepi was a worthy follower in Pinza's footsteps and, having been lucky enough to see him on the stage, I can attest that this voice and acting were as magnificent as they are in the DVD production.  My ONLY regret is that this was not the actual performance, but staged after the fact, as they wanted to have a visual of this great performance and, particularly, of the great Wilhelm Furtwangler's conducting of it, which is indeed splendid.  A better performance of this will be VERY hard to find.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|I don't really know where to start: I can't reconcile that the same guys can own the rights to such a brutal character demolition (done entirely hara-kiri style) and be so brave as to allow its unabridged release, yet at the same time be so wet as to be unable, variously, to work for more than four hours a day, have a conversation between themselves without a therapist or, in Kirk Hammet's case, even string an idiomatic sentence together (is it just me, or does he look like Buster Bluth with as poodle wig by the way?).

To think that these guys even claimed intellectual property, let alone sued anyone for theft of it!<br /><br />It is a fascinating document of the decay of mass media corporate rock, implicating everyone from the Record Company to the fans, marked in every case by a pathological lack of self-awareness. Seeing Lars Urlich leading the charge to sue his own fans, and simultaneously monetising his art collection for literally millions of dollars beggars belief, but then is outdone by the extraordinary self indulgence and utter wetness of James Hetfield throughout large parts of the film. Never before has such a hard man heavy metaller revealed himself to be such a lady's blouse. The departing bass player has it right: Hard rockers don't hire therapists. It's lame.<br /><br />There is a large Spinal Tap element: not only does the documentary spookily similar in content, but Urlich at one point even alludes, correctly, to the \\"S~ Sandwich\\" parallel, and Bob Rock (the Ian Faith equivalent) resembles a portly David St. Hubbins.<br /><br />But for all this, and I don't know how, but the Metallica franchise comes out, ultimately, with a fair bit of credit.

B000PKG6TE|4.0|Being a big fan of R and Songs for the Deaf, I was a bit disappointed with the direction they took with Lullabies which started off strong but then faded after Little Sister. With the exception of a few filler tracks this record is strong all the way through. My only complaint is the lousy production. There are alot of golden nuggets on this record but you have to dig through the mud of the production to get to them. Lullabies had the same issue.
B000002H6C|5.0|...And Justice For All (1988.), Metallica's fourth studio album<br /><br />During the early to mid 1980's, Metallica were to establish themselves as one of the kings of the underground scene with their pioneering thrash metal sound. This culminated in the release of the 1986 classic `Master Of Puppets' regarded by many as one of the all-time great and influential metal albums. However, tragedy was to hit the band during their tour for `Master Of Puppets' when bass genius Cliff Burton was tragically killed in a bus accident in Sweden. This expectedly left a  massive hole to be filled in the band, however the trio of James Hetfield (vocals/guitar), Lars Ulrich (drums) and Kirk Hammett (Lead Guitar) were able to find a speedy replacement in the form of Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted. Metallica then faced the difficult task of releasing the follow-up to their `Master Of Puppets' classic.<br /><br />1988's `...And Justice For All' marks a further milestone in Metallica's definitive early career. This is an album depicting a band pushing themselves further to the limits. `...AJFA' is brilliantly complex with long, in-depth song structures (the album is 65 minutes long across 9 songs!). Here, Metallica are exploring new waters by incorporating a greater level of melody to their music and by also adding further atmosphere and climax to their music. Despite the lengthiness of a lot of the music, the album never slips into boredom during the layers of varied riffs the album displays. There is plenty of strong lyrical themes in this album which are masterfully put together - themes of war, anger, frustration and apocalypse tie the songs together. The spirit and influence of bassist Cliff Burton certainly lives on in this album; it has the high level of vision which he gifted to the band. You can further sense the bandmembers anger at his loss throughout the album. Metallica went further with this album by making their first song video, for the masterpiece `One', indeed the album was giving the band and the thrash metal genre the wider notice it deserved. However if there is one significant negative that this album has, it is the generally poor production. As many other reviewers have commented, the mix for this album is very skewed. The layers of rhythm guitar overshadow a lot of the mix, with the main sufferer being the bass work. Newsted's bass playing is there (if you listen carefully enough) but it is buried way below all of Hetfields lines of rhythm guitar. It doesn't help also that Newsted doubles a lot of the guitar lines and so his presence on the album is sadly diminished in the mix. Another complaint I have with the production is the drums (some may disagree here). This again is a real shame as I feel that Lars' finest drum work is exhibited on this album - he masterfully keeps great drum patterns and beats to some extremely complex sections on the album. The drums are high in the mix but lack the booming presence drums on a metal album should have (especially the sound from the snare). Hopefully this album will get a remaster (It more than deserves it!) and we can hear the album in the glory it warrants.<br /><br />`Blackened' opens proceedings in Metallica's `progressive' forth album. Another acoustic intro gives way to an exceptionally complex structured song. Hetfields vocals about planetary doom and troubles are superbly backed by brisk and impressive riffs. Lars drums this one phemoninally; he handles several changes in meter and speed without any trouble. The commanding middle verses of this song are especially impressive. The title track, `...AJFA' is next, clocking in at a monstrous near 10 minutes. A song about injustice and corruption, there are plenty of punishing riffs as well as some great solos from Hammett. Eventhough I find the song slightly too long, it still makes one hell of a statement. `Eye Of The Beholder' has a much more militaristic beat. An excellent song with plenty a memorable chorus, Hetfield spews lyrical anger about a `big brother' society becoming more and more prominent. The masterful `One' is next, a song that deserves unbounded praise. This is the harrowing tale of a soldier who loses limbs, speech, sight and more. A beautiful, slow semi-acoustic first half paves the way for a rapid fire, aggressive finish.<br /><br />`Shortest Straw' opens in a foreboding manner. This is another album highlight, with more great riffs, lyrics about victimisation and some impressive Hammett solos and lead lines. `Harvester Of Sorrow' is next, a pounding, slower track with a timeless main riff. The chorus is particularly strong with echoing response vocals. `The Frayer Ends Of Sanity' is for me the album's overlooked gem.

Tributed to Cliff, this track features a small section of lyrics which he himself wrote. Although this track drags on a little towards the end and for me is not on a par with `Orion' or `Call Of The Ktulu', it is still an excellent, highly complex song. `Dyers Eve' closes the album with a theme about poor parenting and censoring children.

0393327655|4.0|In \\"The End of Faith\\", Mr. Harris presents the reader with his ideas on a number of issues like faith, ethics, terror.    The main thesis of the book is that belief without evidence is irrational and the cause of all the conflicts between different groups of people in the world. In chapter 2 and 3 Mr. Harris develops this thesis with examples from various parts of the world today and throughout the history and quite convincing in his argument. However at the end of the book we get a strong endorsement for Buddhism as a rational practice. But this time he fails to convince (in fact he does not even try to explain) why Buddhism is any more rational than other religions. For example at some point he refers the reader to the notes section at the end of the book (which is over 60 pages by the way; why not incorporate these lengthy discussions in the actual book) where he says without further explanation that there is credible evidence of reincarnation. What evidence is that? Instead, he seems to be relying on his own \\"faith\\" when promoting Buddhism.    His ideas about the roots of the problems in Middle East is completely off the mark. He seems to be thinking that the muslim terrorists do what they do because they want to go to heaven and get their 72 virgins and for Mr. Harris, apparently the reason is as simple as that. It is easy to be angry with the violence that was perpetrated by the terrorists and this much repeated argument may appeal to the average American. But nobody, regardless of the strength of his faith, will be motivated to kill himself and so many others just for this reason alone. It is a long process which builds up over a long period of conditioning by external factors like poverty, oppression, tyrannical governments, a feeling of humiliation about identity in the light of a sense of history (this sense of historical identity is foreign to Americans); not to mention the would be terrorists' own inferiority complex, credulity, or their psychological makeup in general which makes them easy targets for brainwashing. I strongly recommend Bernard Lewis' two books \\"The Crisis of Islam\\" and \\"What Went Wrong\\", probably in that order, also Robert Pape's \\"Dying to Win\\".     On a related subject to the above, Mr. Harris' evaluation of muslims in general is wrong. On pate 117 of the paperback edition he says \\"If you believe anything like what the Koran says you must believe in order to escape the fires of hell, you will, at the very least, be sympathetic with the actions of Osama bin Laden.\\" This is an awfully wrong interpretation. Personally, I know a lot of muslims and I don't know of any who is sympathetic with Osama bin Laden. Certainly there must be some people who are symphatetic with him or even admire him but for the majority of muslims, Osama bin Laden is a murderer who represents a travesty of Islam, a horrible deviation from the principles. Again, at the end of page 137, Mr. Harris says \\"The Christian who wants to live in the full presence of rationality and modernity can keep the Jesus of Matthew sermonizing upon the mount and simply ignore the world-consuming rigmarole of Revelation. Islam appears to offer no such refuge for one who would live peacefully in a pluralistic word\\". This is a prejudiced point of view! On the contrary, most muslims live peacefully, in fact in countries with longer experience with democracy, most notably Turkey, most muslims are not even practicing muslims but they retain their faith and they do live peacefully. Mr. Harris can't seem to be able to free himself from his preconceived notions.    For me, Mr. Harris' ideas about ethics is the most interesting, and most disturbing. In pages between 142 and 147, he explains his view of what he calls the \\"ethics of collateral damage\\". In warfare, collateral damage is inevitable of course but he further develops his ideas based on this, and criticizes intellectuals like Noam Chomsky and uses the same collateral damage argument for the poverty, misery and all the problems caused by the U.S. foreign policy in different parts of the world. The issue here is more than a disagreement about the foreign policy. He expands the collateral damage argument to cover other areas of human conduct, for example to defend torture in later parts of the book. \\"When ethics are concerned, intentions are everything\\" he says on page 265 then refers the reader to a note at the end of the book. At the note he gives the example of \\"Christian missionaries in the New World who baptized Indian infants only to promptly kill them, thereby sending them to heaven. Their intentions were good. Were their actions ethical? Yes, within the confines of a deplorably limited worldview.\\" To me, this is a grotesque point of view! By the same logic anybody who is convinced of the truth of his cause can be said to be acting ethically, many evil actions can be defended as ethical. Timothy McVeigh thought of victims of Oklahoma City in terms of \\"collateral damage\\". Hitler, in his own \\"deplorably limited worldview\\" was also fighting for the good people against bad people, so by the same logic, was a moral man. By the same logic, even Osama bin Laden, \\"within the confines of a deplorably limited worldview\\" is fighting for a good cause!    Mr. Harris talks into the sentiments of readers and with his clear, accessible, clever writing style he is easy to read quickly and to be agreed with. But on reflection, a more careful reader becomes aware of the conflicts of some of his own ideas, his preconceived notions and the disturbing extensions of his arguments.
B00000724P|5.0|...And Justice For All (1988.), Metallica's fourth studio album<br /><br />During the early to mid 1980's, Metallica were to establish themselves as one of the kings of the underground scene with their pioneering thrash metal sound. This culminated in the release of the 1986 classic `Master Of Puppets' regarded by many as one of the all-time great and influential metal albums. However, tragedy was to hit the band during their tour for `Master Of Puppets' when bass genius Cliff Burton was tragically killed in a bus accident in Sweden. This expectedly left a  massive hole to be filled in the band, however the trio of James Hetfield (vocals/guitar), Lars Ulrich (drums) and Kirk Hammett (Lead Guitar) were able to find a speedy replacement in the form of Flotsam and Jetsam bassist Jason Newsted. Metallica then faced the difficult task of releasing the follow-up to their `Master Of Puppets' classic.<br /><br />1988's `...And Justice For All' marks a further milestone in Metallica's definitive early career. This is an album depicting a band pushing themselves further to the limits. `...AJFA' is brilliantly complex with long, in-depth song structures (the album is 65 minutes long across 9 songs!). Here, Metallica are exploring new waters by incorporating a greater level of melody to their music and by also adding further atmosphere and climax to their music. Despite the lengthiness of a lot of the music, the album never slips into boredom during the layers of varied riffs the album displays. There is plenty of strong lyrical themes in this album which are masterfully put together - themes of war, anger, frustration and apocalypse tie the songs together. The spirit and influence of bassist Cliff Burton certainly lives on in this album; it has the high level of vision which he gifted to the band. You can further sense the bandmembers anger at his loss throughout the album. Metallica went further with this album by making their first song video, for the masterpiece `One', indeed the album was giving the band and the thrash metal genre the wider notice it deserved. However if there is one significant negative that this album has, it is the generally poor production. As many other reviewers have commented, the mix for this album is very skewed. The layers of rhythm guitar overshadow a lot of the mix, with the main sufferer being the bass work. Newsted's bass playing is there (if you listen carefully enough) but it is buried way below all of Hetfields lines of rhythm guitar. It doesn't help also that Newsted doubles a lot of the guitar lines and so his presence on the album is sadly diminished in the mix. Another complaint I have with the production is the drums (some may disagree here). This again is a real shame as I feel that Lars' finest drum work is exhibited on this album - he masterfully keeps great drum patterns and beats to some extremely complex sections on the album. The drums are high in the mix but lack the booming presence drums on a metal album should have (especially the sound from the snare). Hopefully this album will get a remaster (It more than deserves it!) and we can hear the album in the glory it warrants.<br /><br />`Blackened' opens proceedings in Metallica's `progressive' forth album. Another acoustic intro gives way to an exceptionally complex structured song. Hetfields vocals about planetary doom and troubles are superbly backed by brisk and impressive riffs. Lars drums this one phemoninally; he handles several changes in meter and speed without any trouble. The commanding middle verses of this song are especially impressive. The title track, `...AJFA' is next, clocking in at a monstrous near 10 minutes. A song about injustice and corruption, there are plenty of punishing riffs as well as some great solos from Hammett. Eventhough I find the song slightly too long, it still makes one hell of a statement. `Eye Of The Beholder' has a much more militaristic beat. An excellent song with plenty a memorable chorus, Hetfield spews lyrical anger about a `big brother' society becoming more and more prominent. The masterful `One' is next, a song that deserves unbounded praise. This is the harrowing tale of a soldier who loses limbs, speech, sight and more. A beautiful, slow semi-acoustic first half paves the way for a rapid fire, aggressive finish.<br /><br />`Shortest Straw' opens in a foreboding manner. This is another album highlight, with more great riffs, lyrics about victimisation and some impressive Hammett solos and lead lines. `Harvester Of Sorrow' is next, a pounding, slower track with a timeless main riff. The chorus is particularly strong with echoing response vocals. `The Frayed Ends Of Sanity' is for me the album's overlooked gem. A joke on a Wizard of Oz song opens the track (which you could argue as being gimmicky, although it works really well) before the main song starts flowing. This tale of insanity and mental loss is drummed impressively and features some blistering solos. The album's instrumental `To Live Is To Die' follows.

Although this track drags on a little towards the end and for me is not on a par with `Orion' or `Call Of The Ktulu', it is still an excellent, highly complex song. `Dyers Eve' closes the album with a theme about poor parenting and censoring children.

B0007OY2MG|5.0|Witty writing and love the light-speed pace!
B00005JN0T|3.0|I was inherently suspicious of this film, having heard that only about five percent of it had anything whatever to do with Asimov's novel. Taking it on its own terms, though, it's really not a bad hour and fifty minutes of escapism. Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, a man with a bias against robots generally, even though he turns out to be partly bionic himself. The principal architect of the positronic robot revolution -- there's one for every five humans, now -- has apparently committed suicide but Spooner becomes convinced he was killed by one of the new generation of robots U.S.R. is about to release on the market. Asimov's Three Laws don't allow that, but (of course), a way has been found around that little problem. Aside from the fact that the laws even of Newtonian physics are ignored, and that Spooner's weapons seem to hold many thousands of bullets, the gymnastics of the big climatic scene are no more implausible than those in Star Wars. Nice CGI, too.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|The more I watch this film, the more I love it. It's funny, well-paced and Meg and Kevin (as always) are great!
B00005JPAO|5.0|Helen Mirren is superb in her portrayal of the Queen during the traumatic time surrounding the beloved Princess Diana's death. Queen Elizabeth II is caught in a very hard place when her public seems to demand an outward show of emotion and the Queen wishes to hold fast to the tradition of private mourning. The film only gives us a glimpse into royal life and a dramatization of actual events, but it's enough to give the viewer a small idea of how difficult this period was for the Royals and the people of England when they lost their beautiful 'fairytale Princess'. My heart also broke for her children all over again.<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay - Author

Although I am not a big fan of how fondant tastes I can't wait to try some of the cakes in this book.

B000NDIAWY|5.0|for playing Brandy's music. If I hadn't heard her songs on Grey's I would have missed out on this Artist. I love her Voice, her music and the songs truly put me at peace. Brandy has so much emotion in the lyrics and her songs and I have to say she is my favorite artist at this point. I love every song on this CD...and I can't get enough!

6304936362|4.0|1990's \\"Memphis Belle\\" may be sentimental and sometimes corny, but as a story about bomber crews flying dangerous missions over Nazi Germany, it works wonderfully well.  Only the most cynical of viewers will fail to be moved by its simple but appealing presentation.<br /><br />\\"Memphis Belle\\" is a fictionalized account of what happened to a real B-17 crew on its 25th and final mission in Europe before being eligible to rotate home.  In the movie, the crew's mission is a daylight run over the heavily-defended target of Dresden.  An ensemble cast headed by Matthew Modine as the sober young pilot-in-charge goes through its flight preparations, while a series of short vignettes introduces the viewer to the individual members of the crew. The stand-out young cast includes Eric Stoltz as a radio operator with aspirations of being a poet; Tate Donovan as the cocky, attention-seeking co-pilot; Billy Zane as a bombardier who is about to pay a price for living a lie; DB Sweeney as the flak-happy navigator; and in a superb cameo, jazz musician Harry Connick, Jr, as the tail gunner.  Connick, by the way, does a impressive job on an improvised version of \\"Danny Boy\\" early in the movie.<br /><br />The action involving the aircrew on its mission is nicely balanced by a subplot on the ground, as a war-weary Bomber Group commander (earnestly played by David Straitharn) must reel in a cynical public affairs officer (John Lithgow). Their confrontation provides context to what is happening to the Memphis Belle in the air.<br /><br />The final mission turns into a nightmare of flak, enemy fighters, casualties, and mechanical failures, as the crews ends up nursing a stricken bomber towards its home field in England.  The final minutes of the movie should leave no viewer unmoved.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to those looking for an entertaining but fairly realistic movie on the bomber campaign against Hitler's Germany.
B0001GL3KE|5.0|I could watch this movie over and over and over and never tire of it. I catch more bits every time I see it and it never ceases to touch me or make me laugh even though I can do the dialogue with the actors by now.  Highly recommended!
B000002J1S|5.0|This record is just truly great.  I always wanted to hear this record, because I always enjoyed the concept albums of Rush.  Because I have always liked Genesis around the time of Phil Collins, I wanted to give Peter Gabriel a chance. This record is considered his magnum opus so I gave it a shot.  It really is as good as everyone said.  If you like Genesis or the idea of concept albums, get this CD.  It really is a great one.
B00000099Y|1.0|I was introduced to this band back in 1996 and I was instantly hooked, and then after going to the website and doing research and reading what the band was into I was taken way aback.  These people have huge knowlegde base on higher powers-- satan worship.  I have done a lot of research and have found that the lead singer has a very offbeat sense of humor and ANYBODY that makes fun of this band will be sorry, I have reported the drummers website for very obscure remarks made and I would seriously reconsider this band since the drummer is a direct affiliate of aleister crowley, who in the most simple sense sacrificed his own son.  These band members are not teenagers, they are ADULTS.
0385522401|5.0|This book was a joy to read though I partially hesitate to say so lest it speak too much about my own life. Does it have to be similar to personal experience to be so enjoyable? I wonder. There are conversational gems in this beautifully written and hysterical story. This is one book you won't be able to put down even after the climax.<br />I also managed to talk my wife into reading this book and she just thought the couple was ridiculous. No kidding! That was interesting in itself since it leads me to think IM is on to something! Further, in discusing the book with our book group found one other woman who thought the same as my wife! Hmmm. I asked a friend (male) to read it and will be interesting to see if we line up as males and females on this one.
B000001Y2U|1.0|Friend? introduced me to this satan worshiper? and sum years later I listened to my roommate in college and threw it in the dumpster-- anyone in my opinion that goes on MTV and appears occult, then opinions will be, but honestly, as I threw the album away i felt a presence lift out of my body.
B000AARKOO|4.0|I've watched this movie a total of three times and each time I was left slightly confused. For example, how did Orlando become such a great fighter and know so many military tactics from being a blacksmith his whole life? Throughout the movie various people where telling Orlando to \\"protect the people\\" yet they were slaughtering each other. For example, his father was supposed to hand over Orlando to the officers who came after Orlando fled his home town. Yet his father denied and risked the lives of his loyal companions and himself because he \\"did not like the way they asked for him\\". Come on, how is that protecting or abiding by the law? I'm ashamed of the \\"Christians\\" crusades actions in those days. What happened to the king? In the movie he was last shown riding a donkey, so did they kill him? There is too much to assume in this movie.<br /><br />The acting was good, definitely not great. Orlando did his best in the movie and I really love his \\"father\\" as an actor but in casting, you'd think they would get father/son actors to look at least a bit more alike?? Maybe it's just me but it kinda throws off the movie. I can barely understand what the \\"Queen\\" is saying; I think the role might have been better if given to another actress. I don't understand why she cut off all her hair before she even denied her title or officially lost the battle of Jerusalem. There really wasn't any real bond between Orlando and her.<br /><br />I liked the story and understand the effect the director wanted to go with this film but it is just lacking something! I don't know if the editing was to blame for scenes that might have been cut off which explained the plot and details more fully. Whatever the case, I enjoyed watching Troy and a handful of other movies much more than this.
0316067598|5.0|Hey Mr. Swann,  <br />   The weapon he was carrying was a Mark 12, not an M4 you uninformed, inconsiderate prick. Look it up you nitwit. I'd love to know exactly what you were doing for our country when Mr. Luttrell and company were out in those mountains. Have a great day.
0374105235|3.0|I just got through reading this book and although it was good, I really had expected a lot more out of it from reading the previous reviews here.    The book was certainly interesting and did a great job of giving an account for Ishmael's life during his years in Sierra Leone. It obviously contains a lot of violence and drug use. This book is not very long at all and a very easy read. I was a little disappointed in that it did not give a good history of the region, explain the current political situation nor did it really give a clear explanation of why everyone was fighting.  I certainly would have enjoyed and understood the book better if there was a clear explanation of why everyone was the fighting and killing each other.     There was also a part in the book fairly early on when Ishmael's grandfather gave Ishmael some sort of drug that made him have a photographic memory.  This was how he was able to remember all of these events, people and conversations which he now recalls in the book despite being hyped up on cocaine and other drugs. I really didn't buy this and in my opinion the book lost a little credibility.     Realistically I had high expectations for this book and maybe that was my problem. I thought this book could have been one in which would spurn the world into wanting to do something to change the situation in that part of the world for the better.  It didn't inspire me to that level and I wish it did. This book just didn't have that kind of impact on me. I still give it three stars.
B000OLRH10|5.0|Leonardo DiCaprio is truly amazing, as is his supporting actor (sorry, cannot spell his name), but it should be well known to us as he was absolutely phenomenal. It is hard, very very hard, to imagine living life the way these people in Africa have had and do live. Its inconceivable. Every time they discover some new 'treasure' in Africa, be it diamonds, oil, whatever, then rebels come in taking children to be 'killers', brainwashing them most decidedly, and killing thousands for the almighty dollar.     It is definitely worthy of it's oscar nomination, and I would have voted for his supporting actor myself, as he was just that good and convincing, and it is sad and makes one 'think' about all the stupid 'bling' that people over here shoot one another for. There is so much bloodshed for these 'things' and greed is SO apparent. That is the bottom line. It was very very thought provoking, painful, and yet makes one feel like they're living in the lap of luxury even if they are sitting in a small studio like myself with just so much around me. What so many wouldn't give for a simple life like this. Watch it and weep.
B000P0J024|5.0|I can't believe we had to wait until 2007 for this awesome collection to be released ! Sadly, the T.W. albums have been out of stock for years. Now we can enjoy the remastered version of their hits and unrealeased tracks in this awesome collection featuring a bonus DVD.    For those unfamiliar with the band, the members are Jeff Lynne from ELO, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison who passed away while in this band, George Harrison and Bob Dylan. All five used to have some kind of great success in the past so no one was looking for easy money or pretension. All five are great musicians who brought unique styles and creations to rock music. And, most of all, there was already great friendship between the members when they began working together.     The result => a genial and highly enjoyable piece of creation. This collection features memorable songs that should remain in music history as a perfect example of how camaderie can bring gorgeous results in the studio.
B000MR1V22|4.0|I enjoyed this (alot due to Alan Arkin) as it was a very conflicted family with so many problems who go to such lengths to help their daughter reach a dream most likely impossible, and in the end they do just that. It is so funny also, the encounters and what happens along this road to hopeful stardom. Really good movie and highly recommended.
B000J10ERO|2.0|I found it impossible to ignore the ongoing script problems which veered waaaaay off center from the Man Of Steel mythos we have from the comics and the previous movies. I cannot fault the writers for ignoring Superman 3, 4 and 5. . . .    There is simply too much disbelief to suspend here.     In this film, Lois Lane is practically invulnerable, surviving being flung about in a falling plane without a scratch and being whammed over the head by a heavy metal door later in the film to minimal effect. She also must be infected with a Merlin virus, which is the only thing that can explain her being significantly younger than any of the character's previous appearances.  We can always justify an unaged Clark/Superman by saying Kryptonians age differently than humans - I am giving the writers a break here.  Lois also must have been having an affair around the time she and \\"Clark\\" slept together in Superman II - having had her memory of such erased by a Super Kiss at the end of that film yet ending up pregnant. There's no other time line to explain the child we meet in this film. Let's not even go into her level of unawareness about her son. . .    Kevin Spacey rises above the mediocrity of the script, as does Brandon Routh.  He does a fine job recreating the characterization originated by Christopher Reeve, though it is a bit of a shame he did not get a chance to bring anything significantly new to the role.  Not his fault as it's obvious his hands were tied by the director, writers, or both.    If not for the effects work in this film, I would have given it one star - or perhaps none.    Knowing the pantheon of DC and Marvel characters from my comic collecting days through the media success of so many Superheroes, I wish I could say this is going to be added to my extensive film collection, but I can't.  I think I will go find my copy of Larry Niven's short story \\"Man Of Steel, Woman Of Kleenex.\\"  A Much more satisfying \\"what if\\" about a Superman love life.
B000OCXMAE|2.0|You can see the below reviews about my feelings on this album - soft, boring, mediocre, generic pop-rock sound for the most part and some songs that will make you think you are listening to Metallica, Maroon5, or U2.    My biggest concern is this:  DO I HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 4 YEARS FOR THE NEXT LP ALBUM?  I don't think I can suffer much longer.  I can honestly say that I have never heard a LP song I didn't like on any album until I listened to Minutes to Midnight.  I cannot believe they let Rick Rubin pollute their music in such a dramatic way.    Further, since when did LP join the ranks of whiney liberal crybabies?  I really liked the song \\"What I've Done\\" until I saw the video for it.  Taking pot-shots at the president was rather out of character for them in \\"Hands Held High\\".  If I want to listen to \\"socially conscience\\" music, I'll pop in Rage or Green Day.  I understand that LP can sing what they want to sing about, and I don't have a problem with that.  I feel as though they have either 1) used their celebrity to advance a left-wing sociopolitical agenda, or 2) let the bonehead liberals in the entertainment industry \\"influence\\" (i.e. chip in on) their lyrics to help adavance the industry's agenda as a whole.    I am extremely disappointed in this album, and had I heard it first I would have NEVER bought it.  The only time I purchase a CD is when I truly appreciate and want to support the band.  Much to my dismay, this album would have fallen into my, \\"two or three good tracks, but not worth the money for the whole CD\\".  I even ASKED if they had a special edition, so I got suckered in for $22 for the album with the DVD as well.    LP, PLEASE go back to what made you unique and interesting and great sounding.  Fire Rick Rubin.  As far as I'm concerned, with the exception of a two songs, this sounds like another run-of-the-mill pre-packaged half teeny-bopper half mid-life-crisis meld of bands and their sounds from the past.  I wish I didn't fell like this.  If your future albums continue down this path, please refer to the chorus in \\"No More Sorrow\\" - \\"I've paid for your mistakes; your/time is borrowed; your time has come to be replaced\\".
B000MGUZKM|5.0|I am a big Randy Crawford fan and a big Joe Sample fan. However, I did not know they had collaborated previously. I was first introduced to Randy while on a business trip to Anchorage just prior to the release of the Cajun Moon album. I was listening to a smooth jazz station while returning to my hotel from dinner, when this absolutely captivating song came on. I sat in the hotel parking lot till it finished in the hopes the station would tell me what I had just heard. Alas, it was Cajun Moon. I have subsequently bought all of her albums, and not one disappoints.<br /><br />Although I had heard Joe Sample previously, I really became a big fan while listening to WJZZ in Philadelphia while on another business trip. They played X Marks The Spot from the Pecan Tree album, which I ran right out and bought.<br /><br />As I have continued to listen to these two stellar performers I have always hoped they might one day do a project together. When I found Feeling Good on Amazon.com recently it was like a dream come true. This is truly jazz at its very finest. Silky smooth from beginning to end. For anyone not familiar with the work of these two fine performers, here is your chance to hear the very best the world of jazz has to offer.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|I finally got my hands on \\"Humanity Hour 1\\" and it's absolutely amazing! Easily the best album in the genre in years.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are \\"Hour 1\\", \\"The Future Never Dies\\", and \\"Humanity\\", but truly there isn't a weak song on the whole thing. I don't even remember the last time I was so excited about a new release.
0618680004|5.0|I have tried for over 50 years to believe and I just couldn't.  I have attended Nazarene, Methodist, Catholic, Lutheran and Baptist churches over the years and I just could not connect or believe.  When I tried to actually read the bible, I found it boring and its message to be mostly brutal or making no sense at all and there was just too much unexplained magic. I think most people have never read the Bible or they think they are too stupid to understand its meaning and therefore must have a \\"Reverend-type\\" person interpret it by taking one little paragraph and dissecting it and embellishing it with their ideas of what it means.    After reading this book, I feel FREE.  I am happy with my life and feel fortunate that I got to live it. I am not afraid of death.  It is the Religion that makes us afraid of death.  It is a way to control masses of people with the fear of death.      I realize that the reason I could not believe is that my \\"superior to other animals intellect\\" just could not accept it. And you know what, I am still a good person and do not suddenly want to murder or steal anything.  And I don't feel hoodwinked any longer by the religious dogma.
B000PKG6TE|3.0|It took me several spins to figure out what was bothering me about this CD. In a nutshell, most of it comes off as synthetic and too angular for my liking. The drum work, at times, has a preprogrammed feel; the chameleonlike vocals from song to song are impressive but impersonal; the overt tunefulness of past QOTSA albums is mostly missing; even Josh Homme's normally stellar guitar work sounds copy and pasted in spots, phoned in from Pro Tools or some other high-tech software that's available to the masses. Yes, I suppose \\"Era Vulgaris' mostly rocks out, but the album has too much of a robotic, overly metallic sound for my taste. I agree with one reviewer who wrote that Homme tries to fit in too many sounds during the course of one song; not much comes naturally.<br /><br />There are exceptions, of course. \\"Make it Wit You\\" could be QOTSA's biggest-ever hit, if it's released as a single. The song's loose, natural and laid-back sound is a Godsend amid the war zone of big-rock noises that surround it. \\"Make It\\" has true soul, some great piano work and a sensual vibe. Mark Lanegan's lazy drawl at the microphone perfectly complements the Motown-style background vocals during the catchy chorus.<br /><br />So what are the other good songs? Well, the opener, \\"Turnin' the Screw,\\" is unique and commendable, in a Foo Fighters kind of way. The falsetto vocals are cool, the drum loop has a nice groove, a squealing guitar lick introduces the CD with flair and a programmed burst of fireball guitar intersperses the song with gusto. \\"Into the Hollow\\" and \\"3's & 7's\\" are formidable tracks that have elements of classic-sounding QOTSA. \\"Suture Up Your Future\\" is a vaguely swinging tune that picks up steam as it goes, eventually turning into an all-out rocker. For a closing song, \\"Run, Pig, Run,\\" contains a rather stilted sound, like, here's your marching orders, dude, have fun. \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" is a doozy of a tune that features The Strokes Julian Casablancas on vocals, which surprised me. On my first listen to the album, I was sure that Casablancas was doing \\"I'm Designer,\\" which sounds more like his voice to me. Also of note, the video for the frantic \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" definitely lives up to its name.<br /><br />Perhaps the standards have been set so high for QOTSA that a bit of a letdown was not only expected, but also necessary -- every band needs a wake-up call. And you've got to admire Homme's desire and talent to keep things interesting by experimenting in the studio. These songs aren't bad by a long shot, they just miss the magic heard on every past QOTSA record to this point.first listen to the album, I was sure that Casablancas was doing \\"I'm Designer,\\" which sounds more like his voice to me.

B000OVLBEY|5.0|This movie was awesome.I enjoyed it immensely.I loved when Nicholas Cage turned into the skull rider.This movie is definetly a must see.
B000OVLBEO|3.0|As a long time fan of the Ghost Rider Comics as a kid, I had to see this movie.  While a LOT of the character of the movie has NOTHING in common with the source material, it's still an enjoyable B-Movie along the lines of Bubba Ho-Tep or Army of Darkness.    I'd probably have given it four stars if the movie stuck closer to the source and had a darker, more real tone, and five stars had it bee rated R and expanded on the dark nature of the source material as some of the newer comics have.    Instead, we have a corny Johnny Blaze character with no real edge to him, villains that pose no real threat to the Ghost Rider and more often than not simply stand there and get their butts handed to them, and a jumpy cut of a movie that tries not to simply flow from one action sequence to another but ends up simply jumping between action pieces.    That said, the special effects are really good.  Yes, some of the effects shots look goofy...  Yes, the fire effects sometimes leap from realistic to utterly idiotic looking, but the effect overall is very cool and a solid base from which a future sequel should be able to improve upon.    The Extended cut doesn't really add much of anything to the theatrical version of the movie, but the bonus material found on the second disk is worth the price differences.    I really do hope that they make a sequel to this film with a different title lead actor that goes more \\"adult\\" and dark with the material and makes it less \\"goofy action flick about a guy on a motor cycle with a flaming skull for a head\\" than this one did.    Go into this one expecting an \\"army of darkness\\" style flick that's fun, meaningless and goofy and you'll come out pleasantly surprised.  Go in looking for a dark and gritty horror-like film about a demon of vengeance fighting against the man it possesses who is on a quest for redemption (ala the source material) and you'll cry.  Be warned.    But in the grand scheme of things, this is infinitely better than the FantasticFour movie, the Daredevil movie, Electra, The Hulk movie, most of the Batman flicks, or the abysmal Superman Returns.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|Combines elements of the crafty side of Stone Temple Pilots, the punkier side of Nirvana, and even some manic Frippian-King Crimsom guitar parts.  Comes together to make a Masterpiece all of its own signiture.  This may be their best yet.  I consume tons of music and this might be the best studio release I have heard in 2007.  I don't worship any one band and I like everything from Nike Drake to Motorhead.  So you are not getting a biased review from a QOTSA freak, just a review from a music fan.  Enjoy.
B00007AJF8|5.0|This film is a modern masterpiece, an original idea that has no rival. Genius in film making. That being said it was damn funny too. Who would have thought that you could base an entire movie around John Malkovich. The ; \\"in your own head scene\\" was the funniest thing I've seen in years. Great movie definitely recommend. Call my agent, From now on out its all puppets.
B00004ZD69|5.0|GYBE are probably the best live band I have ever seen and this is their masterpiece.  A very ambitious record that succeeds in making you close your eyes and just listen to the music.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|This is the Best movie in the X-Men trilogy! I enjoyed this movie a-lot! It's more entertaining than Bryan Singer's X-Men movies. Brett Ratner and Hugh Jackman did a great job with this movie!  X-Men the Last Stand is great film! Bryan Singer is a poor director! Bryan Singer's work on Superman Returns proves that he could not direct a superhero film. X-Men :The Last Stand is a must see movie! A
B000007T2Z|5.0|I totally love this record.  Their music here is based less on noise and more on melodies.  It's a really great album even if it's quite different to their later releases.  I remember when I first heard this album many years ago I was totally captivated.
0385522401|5.0|A novel that plumbs the depths of its characters within a love relationship that \\"could have been\\"...McEwan explores his signature themes of miscommunication and love, randomness, the differences between genders. He examines the pivotal role of sex in a relationship--how his characters' views toward sex and their inability to handle those differences and communicate...ultimately drive them apart. The writing is beautful, particularly the descriptions of the English countryside and the playing of classical music. His characters are flawed but these flaws make them that much more endearing. A sad but altogether moving ending. Another masterpiece by this tremendous author.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I will confess straight out - Dream Theater is my favourite band and has been for 12 years. In that time, there have been few disappointments from DT.    Systematic Chaos continues the trend of DT stunning its fans with a new collection of songs. Each album will be great, we know that, the question is really: \\"what shape will the greatness take\\". Systematic Chaos is an accurate description of what to expect from the band... an album full of musical brilliance, fashioned out of what seems like chaos.     The album's start sounds very much like a modern tribute to Rush... some nice synth in the background and a very Alex Lifesonesque riff to back it up (Natural Science springs to mind).    The riffs seem more mature in this album while the leads and key/guitar sync passages are as innovative and astonishing as ever.     High Point... the instrumental passage in track 8 - In The Presence of Enemies Pt2; as well as the Forsaken riff.    Low Point... Track 5 - Repentance is a little monotonous. This is made up for in small part by the array of vocal additions from Steve Vai, Joe Satriani and Dave Ellefson (in all likelihood the Dave Ellefson of Megadeth fame).    This is my impression given three listens of the album. Overall, a great album and may rank in the top three albums DT have put out. It will take a great album to knock Awake and Train of Thought off my top DT albums list.
B0006L0LOS|2.0|As soon as I saw that catsuit, I thought \\"This is going to be the camp classic of the year!\\" Then as the reviews started pouring in and I heard things like \\"Halle slurps tuna out of cans,\\" \\"Halle is given mouth-to-mouth by a cat,\\" and \\"Halle says insipid lines like 'cat got your tongue?'\\" I knew I HAD to see this. I went on opening night for the express purpose of laughing at it, hoping that the entire audience would be with me. Imagine my shock and horror as I found myself actually enjoying it.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is by no means a GOOD movie. The plot in particular hinges on one ludicrous conceit on top of another, and many developments don't stand up to the SLIGHTEST scrutiny, but you know, the whole thing is just so over-the-top ridiculous that you stop caring after a while. Even all the ridiculous elements (i.e. tuna cans), in the context of the movie, don't stand out as glaringly, and since they play it off as Halle is in effect possessed by her cat side, all these compulsive things she's doing sort of work in that context.<br /><br />I didn't like the CONSTANTLY moving camera (and I was sitting in the 3rd row, so it really was nausea-inducing) and the CHEEEEEEEESY digital effects work, but I felt that his idea was to create this entirely pop fantasy comic book universe, so at least it was an IDEA. It didn't work that well, but it was an IDEA.<br /><br />I think it's clear that the Sharon Stone part of the storyline was inspired in large part by THE WASP WOMAN, a 50's horror film in which a woman is the owner of a cosmetics company, and was once the lead model, but is now growing older and has to step down as model. She experiments with wasp royal jelly [though I am pretty sure that wasps don't make royal jelly] in order to hold on to her youth... and of course it turns her into a vicious wasp woman! Sharon Stone in this film follows the same storyline except that the face cream turns her face indestructible. Until it destructs, of course, but let's not quibble.<br /><br />All of the Spice Girls-level \\"feminism\\" this movie supposedly espouses--the usual shtick about how a woman is \\"empowered\\" by dressing in outrageously skimpy outfits and becoming a walking product placement for Revlon--is undone by the ending, in which Sharon Stone, her face finally [and inexplicably] cracked, decides that it is better to die than live life as an unattractive person.<br /><br />I can't say I recommend it, but I will say I had a MUCH better time watching this than I did at Hellboy, Chronicles of Riddick, or the Matrix sequels... You know, bad movies just aren't what they used to be.ll of the Spice Girls-level \\"feminism\\" this movie supposedly espouses--the usual shtick about how a woman is \\"empowered\\" by dressing in outrageously skimpy outfits and becoming a walking product placement for Revlon--is undone by the ending, in which Sharon Stone, her face finally [and inexplicably] cracked, decides that it is better to die than live life as an unattractive person.

B000NA1OXY|1.0|\\"Oh Mickey you're so fine\\"....Oh wait, that's not the song.  I'm sorry it's \\"I could be your girlfriend,\\" right?  My question is, how has she not been sued for copyright infringement.  The claps, the cheerleader-esque chanting, the chord progression.  I know that everyone has influences, but this is taking it to a new level.  I hate when people steal music from some other artist (who may or may not be brilliant, it doesn't even matter).  Musicians who do things like this ruin the credibility of other GOOD musicians.  I mean this is in the same league with Vanilla Ice's sampling.  Looks like Avril ordered a sampler platter and just kept going until she had an entire song....that someone else wrote 20 some odd years ago.  It doesn't stop there.  Avril's five note repitoire and amateurish lyrics did enough to make me want to crawl into a deep deep hole for a number of years.  At least until this pitchy Canadian two-faced theif is out of the business.
B000IFQLKU|4.0|James Blunt was everywhere all of a sudden. After they featured him on Oprah, sales went through the roof, his music was featured in big time bank commercials on TV, you couldn't turn around without hearing it blasting on the radio, he was on Love Monkey starring Tom Cavanaugh, before it was cancelled, playing himself, and who is that having his nipple nibbled by a super model on the beach at St. Tropez?<br /><br />Why it is James Blunt. But being ubiquitous, as it were, has its drawbacks, so get ready for the Blunt backlash.<br /><br />Some people complained they were sick of his high voice, hearing the song so much, and why did he put his capo on the 8th fret, on the song \\"You're Beautiful,\\" making it sound like he was plucking a ukelele. He sounds like a stalker in that song, obsessed with some girl he will never know in the biblical sense.<br /><br />To the scoffers I say, James Blunt has prevailed, and not only that, he has done pretty well for a drab looking English bloke who is not really very tall. That super model was his new girl friend, which makes the song, \\"You're Beautiful\\" a self-fullfiling prophecy, or if anything, it exceeds his dream.<br /><br />Back to Bedlam is a great album by a promising newcomer who has already scored several hits on his first go round. Love the way the piano is woven around his voice and guitar in \\"You're Beautiful\\" and on the other cuts on Back to Bedlam.
0316018953|4.0|I would have to say that I love all the Harry Bosch stories including The Overlook. I enjoyed the ride with the edgy Detective Harry Bosch! The storyline overall was very clever loosely based on a true incident of an unsolved theft of radioactive material mixed with current concerns about terrorism. Once again Michael Connelly shows his keen insight into interpersonal dynamics and politics of law enforcement.  I was glad to see the return of FBI agent, Rachel Walling and the continuing evolution of the complex relationship between Bosch & Walling.    I was, however, a little disappointed with the execution of the story.  I felt that the story needed more development. For instance, while Bosch put the facts together to uncover the \\"true crime\\", despite the misdirection laid out by the perpetrators. The story failed to adequately explain why  one of the suspects who had expert knowledge in law enforcement would panic in face of an investigative trail that was based on theory.       All in all, I was satisfied with this story and recommend it to all Bosch fans.
0670032506|3.0|This book was not bad. I almost gave it 4 stars, but there are some other great books out there. I have already read Allen's 'Getting Things Done', so some of the material was rehash for me. Overall, I think the book does what it sets out to do, and it does contain some useful tips.
B0007LCNKM|5.0|I discovered this album in 07 after hearing their 07' release Boxer ( which is another excellent album) and wish I would have listened to long before, because track for track not much albums are this strong.  The Geese of Beverly Road is probably my favorite followed by Abel and then closely by every other track on the album.

B00082IJ08|5.0|I recently reviewed Gorillaz first self titled album, giving it two stars.    Who can say why things happen the way they do, but somewhere between the release of their first album, and their second, the Gorillaz got their s~~t together.     For the first sound of 2D singing \\"Are we the last living souls?\\" to the last haunting sounds of the choir singing on \\"Demon Days\\" aside from a slight misstep, this album takes off and doesn't look back.    Each song has its own distinctiveness, but a thread of melancholy invades almost every second of the album, due almost entirely to Damon \\"2D\\" Albarn's raspy, intentionally tired sounding voice. This voice fits perfectly with 2D on the Gorillaz music videos, who looks like he's either been crying, or high on pot. LOL    Its hard to choose favorites, each song is a gem (accept, perhaps, for White Lights, but that, I'm sure, is debateable), but if I were to base it on the songs I listen to the most, it would be Last Living Souls, Kids With Guns, Feel Good INC, La Manana, All Alone, and Dare. As you can see that is like half the album, and I definately would have to point out, the other soungs are great themselves.    \\"Demon Days\\" utilizes, in a way the first album was unable to do, a perfect blend of solid beats, smooth vocals, and strong raps. I bought this album a couple of years after its release so the only question now is: when does the next one come out!?
B00000APLB|3.0|As a long time self-professed Stones fanatic, I have gone back and forth with this record for as long as I have owned it (about twenty years). Let's be honest here, after 'Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out!', there is no Rolling Stones live album really worth a damn. 'Love You Live' was issued in September 1977 during the era of the double live record and it has a 'going through the motions' feel through about 3/4's of the thing. Jagger doesn't even bother to sing....(\\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" being a notable exception) it's almost if he is parodying the very notion of recording a live concert or he's parodying himself, the conceit just oozes from his voice. It really is no surprise that during an admittedly fallow period for the band, 'Live' would rear its head. The El Mocambo songs are indeed the highlights of the record and take on immediate urgency due to inner turmoil of the band due to Keith's drug bust. (Band intros are lame though.) It does seem like a miracle that Keith got out of this jam and the band made 'Some Girls' after this tedious outing. \\"Honky Tonk\\", \\"Sympathy\\", \\"Happy\\", \\"Dice\\", \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Jack Flash\\" have all been performed better with much more memorable live versions (such as from 'Ya-Ya's' or the concert film 'Ladies and Gentlemen') and that is why they all have a hohum kind of feel to them, although the guitar interplay between Keef and Woody on \\"Sympathy\\" is exceptional (still not better than 'Ya-Ya's'). Much to the consternation of longtime fans, the Stones would churn out another five live records!!!!! Why???? Do we really need to hear another version of \\"Satisfaction\\" or \\"Brown Sugar\\"? I know I'm in the minority here but 'Love You Live' is nothing special and should be seen for what it really was, a stop gap cash grab and not great live rock n' roll.
B00005LMBK|2.0|Ive read a good chunk of the reviews for this album, and as much as it pains me, I have to disagree with most of them.    My understanding of this album (while I may be wrong) is that this album was originally done as a sort of joke, a cynical view of hip-hop music and culture by the creator of Gorillaz, Damon Albarn, one of the members of the alternative band, Blur. Based on that assesment, this album is a triumph.     While some of the songs are decent and perhaps worth a listen (Re-hash, Clint Eastwood, perhaps a couple of more) the majority of the album is poorly produced, the music is thin and uninteresting, the raps are corny and very \\"MC Hammer\\", and, if anything, I get the impression that the creators of Gorillaz may have been surprised by the reception the album received, mainly due to the hit \\"Clint Eastwood\\" one of the few redeemable songs on the album.    Of course, that is just my take, and it could be that this album was a definate effort from the creators of Gorillaz, but one major thing gives me pause at believing that: Gorillaz second effort, Demon Days.    This is not a Demon Days review, so I won't go into detail, but it is sufficed to say, that in light of the smooth, hypnotic tunes of Demon Days, and the obviousness of the effort that went into it, \\"Gorillaz\\" seems like they were messing around, then realized they may have actually had something (again, based on the perhaps unforeseen success of \\"Clint Eastwood\\") then went back, this time taking the time and care needed to craft a superb album.    In the end, \\"Gorillaz\\" is more bad then good. There are a couple of stand out songs that you may want to download via Itunes, such as Clint Eastwood and the Souldchild Remix of 19-2000 (a light, fun track, vastly superior to its original counterpart). For me, the real test of a good album is how long it has played in my car.    This one I played about 2 times.
B000MXPE7O|4.0|Directed by Robert DiNiro, this is the fictionalized story of the beginnings of the CIA.  Matt Damon is cast as Robert Wilson, a composite character who believed in America and closed his eyes to some of its abuses in the belief that he was doing the best he could for his country.  We see him first as a young man joining the Skull and Bones society at Yale, a secret society steeped in tradition which shaped the lives of many of America's leaders.  The CIA is a secret society too, and as the film progresses the audience sees how it shapes its members.  There's a code of right and wrong here, and Wilson makes choices about what he sees as \\"right\\".  He marries Angelina Jolie because she is pregnant, but her life is lonely and unfulfilled because he never loves her.  His relationship with his son as well as everyone else has a wide variety of strings attached.  And, in the, end, Robert Wilson learns the price of a life filled with righteous deception.<br /><br />Matt Damon's acting ability is flawless in this film.  He embodies his character completely.  The storyline however, is extremely confusing and I suspect it was by design.  The audience often does not know what is happening or why.  This soon grows tedious to watch however, especially as the film is more than three hours long and it is impossible to be sure of who the bad guys and the good guys are.  As a result, I was bored a lot and even though this is clearly a worthwhile film, there are lots of problems with the fuzzy plot.<br /><br />For many, the appeal of excellent acting and a critique of the CIA's role in America since the 1960s will result in a satisfying film experience.  It wasn't quite enough for me however.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|Being a fan not so much of the Marvel Comics, but their characters and their universe, I saw this movie the first day I could and bought the best DVD the first day I could. What most impresses me about these comic book films is the  old-fashioned thrill ride popcorn fun. Ghost Rider is more than that, Mark Steven Johnson took the mythology from the comics and painted a unique new feel for the film. Chrome and dark leather! Ancient demons duking it out in the Old West! Ghost Riders in Monument Valley! Well, after being blown away by Johnson's \\"seriously, here's the real movie\\" cut of Daredevil, I anticipated what the EXTENDED EDITION had in store. The film itself isn't that much longer, but includes new scenes which add much needed depth and gravity to the Blackheart character that may have had you scratching your head in the theater. Would you turn down extra scenes with Peter Fonda as the Devil?  Disc 2 really immerses you in the world of Ghost Rider. A Documentary (split into 2 parts for reasons that are lost on me) covers the 10-year process of bringing this film to life. It is a joy to see how Nic Cage just lets go on set, totally crazy. Alas, \\"making of\\" docs are a given on modern DVDs, and the Extended Edition offers the real price of admission: The comic book history of Ghost Rider. Split into 4 decades, this tells the comprehensive story of how the narrative, art, mythology, villains, and of course the Ghost Rider himself and his flaming chopper have evolved from a corny but compelling western into a dark and engrossing fantasy.  Sure, you can rent the standard DVD, but if you want to know infinitely more than just how it ends, you have to buy this full-featured DVD!
B00005JPD0|4.0|OK -- I did not totally get all the sci fi stuff, but it didn't matter in the whole scheme of things. This movie left me breathless.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a sharp ATF Agent investigating a ferry explosion which left over 500 people dead. He figures out (rather quickly) that the ferry disaster is connected to a seemingly unrelated murder of a young woman whose body washed up on shore shortly BEFORE the explosion. He eventually joins a special \\"surveillance\\" team that has technology that I cannot even begin to explain accurately here. In a nutshell, they are able to use satellite imagery to recreate everything that took place 4 days and 6 hours ago, from every vantage point. As the team uses this technology to find the identity of the person who blew up the ferry, Denzel's character devises ways to maximize its potential to save lives. It's already been mentioned in several reviews that he travels back in time, so that's no surprise, but what he does when he gets there will blow you away (no pun intended...sorry.)<br /><br />This is a WILD ride...there's no need to understand the science behind the technology, the murder mystery/suspense is enough to grab you for the duration of the movie. It is extremely fast-paced and features excellent (beyond excellent, really) acting by Denzel. The ending totally blew me away, although I really didn't get that either! Highly recommend.<br /><br />Cris Cunningham for Amazon.com
B00012QM9K|5.0|I rate this movie 9.5/10 or 5 stars. This movie is among the 1000 Best Movies in DVD's by Peter Travers and in the Top 10 list of Best American Movies Ever. The movie won several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Director. Steven Spielberg directs this movie 10 years after he read the book for the first time and was completely fascinated with the story. As a Jewish himself, he brings to the screen the story of those Jews who survived the Holocaust thanks to one man -Oskar Schindler-, who gave them the opportunity to work in his factories during the end of World War II. The movie shows the brutality of the Nazi army against the Jews, and how they were being killed at different Death Camps (Auswitch, etc.). The movie is based on true facts collected after the testimony of many people who experienced the Holocaust and survived. The movie is rated R for obvious reasons and it is very difficult to contain the tears. This DVD Collector's Gift Set edition is absolutely wondeful, including a special plexiglas casing, a picture book showcasing images by photographer David James with a foreword by Spielberg, the Original Soundtrack by the Oscar winner and always superb John Williams, and a rare limited edition senitype individually numbered and made from a actual film frame from the movie. (So the price it's just a bargain with all of that!). I want to say that, despite not being a Jewish nor coming from a country involved in World War II, I feel absolutely moved by the story told here and I have enormous respect and empathy for the Jewish community and for all the atrocities they have gone through their history. This is a necessary movie that needed to be done and needs to be seen by as many people as possible, so we don't make the same mistakes in the future. We are all human beings, and we all deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, regardless our religion, ethnicity, race, social status, sexual orientation, etc. Unfortunately today, we are still witness of so many intolerance and bigotry that makes me feel embarassed and very sad. We all should work together for human peace, love and understanding among all peoples from all countries in the world. This movie helps people understand how important it is to know each other and understand each other, so ignorance and hatred does not govern our lifes.<br /><br />P.S. If you like my review vote YES. You can read all my other reviews if you wish to. I modestly write them to help people form an opinion about movies, music and books, but if nobody reads them (if you don't vote I do not know if you did) there is no point in writing them.f so many intolerance and bigotry that makes me feel embarassed and very sad.

B000NVIGC0|5.0|I often read reviews and find myself agreeing with the 5 stars and 1 star reviews quite easily.  Everyone has an opinion of how the music made them feel at any one particular time.  Some are even helpful and sensical.  That being said...  listen to this album.  Really sit down, stand up, walk around, and listen to this.  I have.  The songwriting is refreshing.  I find myself liking one song over another each time I listen.  I am proud to be a Wilco fan and even happier that the group's style is continually changing.  Not improving, but changing.  I feel I am also someone who relates with Tweedy's words and thoughts.  This obviously makes it easier to absorb and appreciate the album. You need not know the band, its diverse catalogue, or history to get into this.  The best albums, I find, are those that take more than one sitting to decide the number of stars you will assign.  Listen. Decide.  I hope you can discover the subtle power of the everyman band that is Wilco, and the soulful simplicity that is Sky Blue Sky.
B00006M183|5.0|This makes my top 3 favorite Pearl Jam releases yet.  Its definitely one of their most artistic albums.  Along with No Code and Binaural its the bands most experimental album.  Its not heavy like Ten, Vs, or Yield.  Its very alternative and you have to listen to it  having an open mind.  If you buy this album just wanting a good hard rock album, youre more than likely going to be disappointed.  Riot Act was one of my first PJ albums to buy and I have absolutely loved it since the first time it went into my cd player.  It has a wide variety of songs that all pretty much sound different.  No song on this album really sounds like another.  Its just really a great album to put on and listen to all the way through.  Its one of the few albums I do that with.  Thats how good it is.  Ive never got bored with this masterpiece.  It seems everytime I listen to it I always hear something new.  Thats due to the albums production.  Its Pearl jam best album in terms of production.  None of their other albums ever souned this warm and vibrant.  Its full of really nice sounds that you usually dont hear on other records.  Like I noted, its very experimental in just about everything it contains.  This is drummer Matt Camerons best work as well.  Some of his stuff on here can be very weird to play and it takes some listening to to really hear what all hes playing.  I love it.  A really great album, not only for Pearl Jam standards, but a great album period.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|i'm not a rock fan but this cd has got me to become 1, i love every track, my favorite tracks are \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Chemical Party\\"     When is the next album comin out
0743496728|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me and I really didn't like the idea of this book but I read it anyway. Overall, this is excellent read but at times it may get boring.        I liked this book because it gave the true emotion. I don't think the author had a son that went to school one day and killed ten people. She had to put what she knew into the book, which is amazing...
0061142026|5.0|I enjoy reading fantasy books, but I'm careful in selecting them since I don't like those that are too juvenile. My fears were completely unfounded with \\"Stardust\\" as this is a beautiful story that \\"works\\" on many levels and is suitable for all ages. I was drawn to the characters, most of who have both redeeming and unpleasant qualities that make them believable.<br /><br />I have the paperback version which is very portable but I now wish I had bought the hardback since this is a book I'd like to keep and pass down to others.
B000000WJZ|5.0|well this will be review 450 and i guess there aint much to say that hasnt been said at this point. so shut my mouth and strike the demons... yeah, you see i was only 4 when it came out and my sister who was only 8 had it new. the thing is i dont really remember much of it from when i was a kid. so skip some odd years later plus a shattered soul and you have me at 18, a diehard pumpkins fan of about only a year, and when i first heard sweet, sweet again it was instant nostalgia of heart warming bliss, like that song had never left my heart all those years. all in all it is the best sp album because it is the most flawless even though personally i find no flaws in any sp material. i will listen to these songs until my heart beat implodes, nothing short of that. the thing is that my taste in music is so big that i could kick it with most that love all good music, and still could not say there is anything in the history of music like the splash in \\"TODAY\\" after those opening chords of angel dust...nothing! billy better be playing most if not all of these songs on upcoming shows, hard to do when his songs list is extremely dense, still i'll prolly be the guy in the front wearing my zero tee yelling play SWEET SWEET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000O178BY|1.0|I am a huge NIN fan but this album is probably the most horrid thing I have ever heard. After listening to this CD for the first time my ears began to bleed and I cried for hours after hearing the horrid sounds. This album is as big of a let down as Tool's 10,000 days album. I would suggest avoiding this Album like the plague. Like I said am a huge fan of NIN... or was. If they release crap like this I have a feeling there fan base will completely die. The 5 star reviews you have seen for this album are the extremely hardcore fan base that would give 5 stars to an Album with Trent Reznor talking to a finacial consultain for 53 minutes about the money he just robbed from his fans for buying this album.
B000060MMI|5.0|This is Flogging Molly at their absolute best. Every track is great. What else is there to say. Great music by a great band. I never get tired of this recording.
0307275639|4.0|Perhaps this isn't quite the classic 'life-changing experience' some reviewers say it is, but it's definitely worth reading for a glimpse at an unusual friendship. Yes, much of Morrie's 'wisdom' is simple common sense, but the point of this book is that people need more of that in their lives!  I won't question Albom's motivations for writing this book, or quibble too much over his writing style(perhaps if I get around to reading more his non-sports work).  I approached 'Tuessdays with Morrie' with an open mind, knowing that it had a lot of hype behind it, and curious as to whetehr it would up. It definitely did!  Read it...it'll make you appreciate some of the simpler things in life!
B00005JPFE|5.0|I would give this film 10 no 20 stars if I could.  I laughed, I cried, I hugged my friend and I left the theatre with tears in my eyes.  The sneak preview theater was packed.  Kids were well behaved throughout the whole film.  It is more than just a story of Remy the rat who want to become a chef....it is a story of family, friendship, loyalty and love.  Each and every one of those values is brought out in this film.  Walt woud've been proud.  The animation was wonderful: the beautiful Parisian skyline, the detail in the kitchen, the fur on each and every creature, and the movement of the characters.  I have waited with much anticipation for this film and when I had the chance to see it, I ran with it.  I will see it again when it opens nationwide and I will tell EVERYONE to go see it.  It runs a little long but it is necessary to tell the story.  You stop seeing Remy as a rat....not that you see him as a person....but he's someone you care about.  All of animation is top notch.  Pixar outdid themselves with this film.  It is wonderful.
B000JLTRIG|5.0|The whole series has been so cool so far. I'm really sad that it is coming to an end.
0307346609|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for yet another unique take on the zombie genre but here it is. This book immerses you in its world and it's a world-wide perspective. Even the book flap descriptions remain \\"in character\\". In spite of the fact that it's a zombie novel, the story is believable in many ways. It's intelligent, engrossing, realistic and a must-read for any fan of the genre.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Well, I won`t buy it. I'll just download it, like the criminal the label thinks I am...
B0001XAPX8|4.0|Philip Roth's book The Human Stain was a fictional examination of racial/social and sexual biases in American culture with more than a dose of hypocrisy thrown in. I expected it to be a difficult novel to translate to film and I believe I was partially right.<br />The casting is excellent and Nicole Kidman is very good as Faunia Farley a bit of a lost soul being stalked by her violent and insane ex-husband who gets involved with an older college professor who has just lost his position due to an abnormally ridiculous case of Political Correctness. Anthony Hopkins is fabulous in that role although as the plot unfolds it becomes a bit harder to see him as the older version of his younger self as portrayed in flashback sequences. (Trying hard not to give too much away here).<br />A real strong performance by Ed Harris ( The most underrated guy in Hollywood) as the crazed husband cements this as a film worth checking out.<br />It's understandable why this wasn't a huge hit at the box office because it is a literary and somewhat challenging film.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|These guys from Germany have been writing the soundtrack of my life for decades.  Back in my heavy partying days in the '80s, the Scorps were there accompanying me on too many exploits to tell.  They were with me when I met my beautiful wife, who is also a Scorps fan.  Through the years, they have been an inspiration and a very important part of my life.  Since Eye to Eye came out, I thought maybe their days were over, but Humanity has proven me wrong.  And very gratefully so!  I love this album from start to finish, simple as that.  They have proven to the world that they can still make great rock music and still teach the younger generations a thing or two about writing music.  They are my favorite band of all time, hands down.
0606037225|5.0|Purchased this book as a gift for my husband.  It's a classic!!![[ASIN:0453005071 The Bachman Books : Four Early Novels by Stephen King (omnibus of Rage, The Long Walk, Roadwork and The Running Man)]]
B000OVLBEO|1.0|Ghost Rider should have been a kick a** movie, instead, it got its own a** kicked, through a poor script, terrible CGI, and bad acting. It's time for a restart on this one, Marvel. Just like the Punisher, Daredevil, Elektra, and Fantastic Four, you should restart these franchises. Whereas with Hulk, there was no need to restart it, but you are -- go figure!
6302110165|5.0|Let's start with FANTASTIC FILM and take it from there!    Director Penny Marshall hit it big with Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro when she assembled AWAKENINGS for 1990. Other films that year, THE DOCTOR and BEAUTIFUL DREAMERS which also explored breakthrough personalities of the health profession, hit the big screen and all of these films seen together present amazing of the health care profession.    We have Malcolm Sayer( Williams) neurologist and discoverer of the wonder drug L-DOPA as our subject of AWAKENINGS. People fell into complete immobilizing sleep that held many captives for years. This film follows one such awakening from this comatose state,a patient named Leonard (DeNiro),who is brought back to the conscious world through Sayer's administering of L-DOPA.     Not enough great things can be said about this film. It is so well acted and incredibly touching. The film really moves and never lags in the slightest.    Great companion films would be WIT, THE DOCTOR, BEAUTIFUL DREAMERS, THE ELEPHANT MAN and PATCH ADAMS
B000HEWEE4|5.0|The Lake House is a rare, modern romantic drama that won't fail to delight the viewer. As beautiful as it is mysterious, watching it a second time proved more enjoyable than the first. Without the need to decipher the mystery before the film ended, I was able to enjoy the heartfelt roles of both Kate (Sandra Bullock) and Alex (Keanu Reeves) free from any images of Miss Congeniality or Neo from The Matrix. The mystery surrounding the lake house keeps this story a class above any other drama or romance of late and I do hope we see Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves working together in the years to come.
B0006957SA|5.0|Shane MacGowan's voice cuts through the title track and sets up what is a fabulous collection of songs that range from rollicking Irish/Punk to folksy ballads. Not a bad cut and just an all around great recording. The Pogues are the real deal and this is one of their best.
B0000AOV85|5.0|I gave this as a gift. We watched it then I took it back for MY collection. I'm no friend when it comes to Floyd. This DVD exposes some amazing tracks and never before seen (and heard) stuff that blew my mind. Alan Parsons sits at a mixing board and plays with the MASTER TAPES right before your eyes like it was nothing at all. Sheesh.<br /><br />Again, this blew my mind. What a great DVD. A MUST for Floyd fans!
0060763280|2.0|This book is very light in terms of content, it does not give you any definate strategy, just a lot of stories and anecdotes to pep you up.  Of the 17 \\"wealth principles\\", many are worthless cliches, although several were sound and worthy of further reflection.  The book is really spoiled by the author's reliance of several mystical beliefs, essentially bordering on the basic idea that if you think wishfully about money all the time, the universe will just provide more of it to you.  The book is further devalued by the author's constant references to his additional products-I feel ripped out when I pay money for a book and instead of substantive information, I receive advertising.  You can flip on the TV anytime late at night and watch advertising for various get rich quick schemes for free.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Hands down this CD is my most cherished cd out the  100 or so that i have. Nothing else compares! I love all the songs on it,(except volcano)which is very rare, Most of cds i normally like three or four. But this, this is unreal, you have to have it. As soon as he released it in the states I bought it. And i heard his music long before they decided to sell it here. My all time favorite is Blower's Daughter,Cold Water,I Remember,Older Chests, Ohh i can't make up my mind. There all good, and Damien,Damien is Great!
B000065BPB|4.0|After reading many reviews on Sennheiser headphones, I decided to buy the HD-280 ones. At first, the tightness was way too high. As I am not used to closed headphones, use was only possible for up to an hour before my hears became sore. After several days of use, this has diminished to the point where it's no longer an issue. The sound suppression is awesome, not being able to hear someone talking next to me when the music is on.    Regarding sound quality, I can only say one bad thing: It's so great that MP3 files and CD's don't satisfy me anymore, neither do my speakers. I know see the need to get vinyl's and analog synthesizer's instead of software-based ones. That's how good the sound quality is.    A great value/price ratio.

037571457X|5.0|Marjane Satrapi has written a fine addition to a growing body of graphic novels that really portray the absurdities and immense dangers of life in a repressive regime. Satrapi's work easily joins other strong works such as \\"Maus\\" by Spiegelman and \\"Pyongyang\\" by Delisle.<br /><br />Satrapi's is, of course, unique. Hers is the story of living under two different repressive regimes and watching a revolution become perverted (although one could wonder if her parents really understood the Iranian Revolution at all since they seemed to think it was a Communist one for quite a long while). The simple illustrations help to emphasize the de-indvidualization that came with the Islamic revolution - all of the women and girls look the same thanks to clothing and the men look the same due to beards.<br /><br />If you are at all interested in current events in the Middle East or even interested in basic human rights issues) than I recommend you check out this book.<br /><br />I give this one a grade of \\"A\\"
B000P6R6X8|5.0|I really think the over-simplification that a lot of critics have been spewing forth about this album is just lazy.  They just went along with the storyline of Tweedy's current vibe following his recovery as the humble and direct bandleader who 'really wants us to like this record', and how he just wanted to sing some songs for people. So, they write their little reviews about it being 'simple' and 'straightforward' 70s influenced...blah blah blah.      Anyone who has ever actually made a record within the last 10 years though knows how much less musicianship it takes to do 1,000 overdubs and then cut, paste, and edit like a madman in pro-tools to make it sound the way you want than to do it the way Wilco did on this record.      Most records today are of this cut and paste variety, with the producers and engineers often having as much or more to do with the record's final sound than the musicians themselves.     However, I still feel their is something magical about a band playing together in a room, and being able to pull it off 99% live and really capturing the moment, which to me is what rock 'n' roll is truly about.  You can see and hear the amount of time and energy the band spent playing together and working out these arrangements...plus the fact that they all play together and don't try to play over each other...it's just a great band of talented, mature musicians.  Something very hard to find these days.      To me this is like how the Beatles' \\"Let It Be\\" album would have turned out if they were all still working together as a cohesive unit - great rock songs with tons of feeling, played to perfection.  Long Live Wilco!!!!
B00008PC2O|5.0|It's no surprise that the editors of \\"Entertainment Weekly\\" would choose both \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" and \\"Aliens\\" as two of its 25 Best Action Films of all time.  Both are sequels that significantly up the special effects ante, along with the body count, and both feature two of the movies most dynamic kick-[...] heroines, Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton\\" in the former and Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the latter.<br /><br />Besides doubling the action of the first, \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" also doubles the cyborg quotient by returning Arnold Schwarzenegger in the role that he was born to play (this time as a \\"good\\" cyborg) and bringing in a more than equal combatant/foe in the from of the Robert Patrick as an \\"upgraded\\" model.  The movie adds an element of surprise in the form of the much smaller (and less developed) Patrick as a superior model to Arnold's character, able to best the strongman in many a scene.<br /><br />The movie also brings back Earl Boen in an expanded role as the befuddled \\"Dr. Silberman.\\"  He brings needed comic relief in a film that is short on words but long on action sequences.<br /><br />James Cameron may have felt on \\"top of the world\\" a decade later with his Oscar-winning \\"Titanic\\" but it is for the first two \\"Terminator\\" films that he probably made his greatest cinematic impact.
B00005JN0T|2.0|I recently had the opportunity to view the film I, Robot, or Short Circuit 3 as it has come to be known by the Ft. Collins cultural elite. Although this movie is set 30 years in the future, Detective Del Spooner's (Will Smith) jokes and witty antics keep with the times and never fail to elicit uproarious laughter. I guess phrases like \\"Oh, hell no\\" and \\"Now that's what I'm talkin' bout\\" are timeless comic masterpieces. Don't let the Fresh Prince's diction fool you, this movie pushes as many P.C. hot buttons as Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 and Mel Gibson's recent emotional masterpiece Lethal Weapon 4. I, Robot exemplifies a tried and true statement: when there are a lot of fancy robots in the future, all types of ill stuff will happen. Sure it's the same lesson we learned in The Terminator trilogy but let's face it, jokes and robots never really get old. The producers certainly did their homework in taking some ingredients from other popular sci-fi movies to complete their futuristic recipe for 100% action. A certain scene comes to mind when Will Smith must traverse a giant staircase, pure Ghostbusters. They might as well have suited him with a proton pack and warned him of the dire consequences that may arise by crossing the streams. I guess I can't argue with success. Does the film do its job? While I wasn't impressed very much -- and I am an avid fan of the Bad Boys films -- I have a good feeling that the younger crowd got the message loud and clear. As I was leaving the theater with a few friends, some teenagers in a futuristic looking Subaru yelled swear words at us and drove somewhat recklessly thereafter. (It should be noted that one of us looks strikingly similar to a robot.) They were obviously fired up by what they had just seen and had taken notes from a few of the car chase segments in the film. My fellow theater goers and I shook our heads and laughed: These kids today have no idea, one little fight and your mom may get scared, then you're moving with your auntsie and uncle to Bel-Air.    Grade C-, spend 7 dollars on one of those hats that make it look like there is an arrow through your head instead.
B00006LI4S|5.0|*sniff*  *sniff*<br /><br />This video is beautiful. there is one part where Dave is explaining this bit from Darkside and it's mixed in such a way where it goes from darkside to him singing it in present and it is amazing. His voice is so beautiful even though he is showing some age here. Well...This DVD is a treasure for any fan of Pink Floyd or David Gilmour.<br /><br />His style is great. The only bad thing I can say about this DVD is that it showed how much older he is getting. I am sad for the day that he will pass. I long for another album that is GOOD!<br /><br />:)
B000NA1Z1A|5.0|Last month I had the opportunity to hear BACK TO BLACK by Amy Winehouse courtesy of a co-worker of mine. Normally my musical preferences is at the opposite end of the spectrum (darker and more aggressive) but in Amy's case I loved what I heard. I finally got a hold of my own copy of BACK TO BLACK. I have been listening to the cd non-stop. I really don't care for r&b music. Today's r&b is slickly overproduced. Amy's music has a vintage Motown influence with a splash of jazz thrown in to the mix. The production is gritty like a lot of old school r&b/soul music were back in the day. I like how unique Amy's vocals are. They have a slighty whiney, raspy edge but without being annoying. I think the standout track on the entire album is the hilarious \\"Rehab\\". Gotta love the lyrics. Another great track is \\"You Know I'm No Good\\". For some odd reason the song sounded like it would have been great for the great Shirley Bassey to sing. Not wild about the rap on the remixed version of the song. I wished the album wasn't so short but on the other hand it left me very eager to hear more from Amy.
B00004SZWD|5.0|If you check your local music store and looked through the Stevie Wonder CDs, you are likely to find this album more than the other albums (aside from \\"A Time To Love.\\") Though this album is over 30 years old, it's still in demand, and with a good reason: the 21 songs on this album are some of the greatest works to ever enter the music industry.    Most artists these days stick to one type of music, rarely trying something different. Wonder, on the other hand, has mastered not only his usual R&B and funk songs such as \\"I Wish,\\" but on this album he also throws in some Latin, classical and funk/rock fusion twists, and he delivers them just as well as his usual genre.    Wonder without a doubt has talent in songwriting. He sings about almost everything that you can sing about, such as world peace (\\"Love's In Need Of Love Today\\"), love (\\"Knocks Me Off My Feet\\"), heartbreak (\\"Another Star\\"), world problems (\\"Village Ghetto Land\\") and equality (\\"Black Man\\") to name a few. No matter what he sings about he delivers some of the best vocals, lyrics and composing of all time. Most of his songs are upbeat and danceable, such as \\"Ngiculela\\" and \\"Sir Duke.\\" \\"As\\" and \\"Summer Soft\\" are the most beautiful, poetic songs on the album and the music accompanying them are just as extraordinary. The funk songs Wonder is known for are also here. \\"I Wish\\" and \\"All Day Sucker\\" are funkier than \\"Superstition\\" from the album \\"Talking Book.\\" \\"Ebony Eyes\\" is a very fun song that has a slight Beatles feel to it.    Wonder also includes two instrumentals: \\"Contusion\\" and \\"Easy Goin' Evening.\\" Both of them show Wonder's skill with instruments, especially the harmonica (in \\"Easy Goin' Evening\\") which he is very well known for. \\"Contusion\\" is a great display of R&B/rock fusion and is very fun to dance to.    With twenty-one songs on this album, each of them some of the greatest songs ever, it's difficult to not like the album. This is music at its absolute best.
B00005N5S5|5.0|Entertainment Weekly recently touted the first sequel (\\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\") to this film as being one of The Twenty-Five Best Action Films of all time.  That title may be an accurate assessment of the non-stop action of the sequel but what would it have been without its predecessor which ranks as one of the best science fiction commentaries on the path that we may be going with our computer-dependent society.<br /><br />James Cameron scored a casting coup when he gave the role to Arnold.  At the time, the muscle-bound actor had had a few films under his belt, films that played mostly on his physical appearance and his novice acting skills.  \\"The Terminator\\" character was short on dialogue but Cameron made the best of his star by providing him with one-line zingers and stares that could wake the dead.<br /><br />To call the part \\"tailor-made\\" for Schwarzenegger would be a major understatement.  He was muy perfecto.<br /><br />Linda Hamilton, not yet the household name that she would become for TV's \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" as well as not yet the future \\"Mrs. James Cameron,\\" is appropriately confused and terrified as the waitress that would ultimately become the mother of the man that would rescue humanity.<br /><br />Michael Biehn is well-cast as the other traveler from the future, intent on preventing Arnold's malevolent cyborg from doing his killing-thing.<br /><br />Stan Winston's effects still hold their own after almost a quarter of a century.

1852691247|3.0|For a child under 3 the illustrations are too abstract. For example the egg on a leaf looks like nothing! A young child needs clearer, more vivid illustrations. My baby (1 year) loves the pictures in her other books but so far, this book is good only for chewing! With the exception of the Saturday diet (icecream, cake, salami etc). I'm hopeful that when she gets older she'll enjoy the book more.
1582701709|5.0|Awhile I read this book from the beginning I learn how to be attracted become more positive. Many people only appreciate the negative thoughts when I say positive thought they start saying I am lying to what I say and not telling the truth to the topic. Many people are attracted on the negative thoughts they never learn to say good things mostly likely they miserable to their life they want other people to become miserable too like them. This book teaches me to become attracted to be positive what I want. This book explain the attraction which is telling how you are attracted be is up to you what you are attracted is it positive or negative. For me I got attracted to become more positive I feel good about it. The book is only explaining  how you are attracted on the universe  is up to you what to decide to yourself cause nobody can change you is only yourself well being can do it(your force of action). We all have different experiences only you which to decide. I like this book teaches me something I don't relay only one book I consider this one of my references.

0743270754|4.0|Goodwin's much-praised, massive \\"multiple quasi-biography\\" of Abraham Lincoln and the contentious men who composed his Civil War-time Cabinet proved to be worth my wait - though not without its share of flaws.  Lincoln is the clear hero of the tale, the oft-\\"mis-underestimated\\" man whose rivals for the 1860 Republican Presidential nomination - William Seward, Salmon Chase, and Edward Bates - regarded him with a mixture of condescension and exasperation.  The \\"Illinois country lawyer\\" proved to have an unsurpassed ability to take such individuals into his administration and keep their disagreements from erupting into internecine warfare that might have seriously damaged the cause of the Union during the war.  Goodwin may slightly overstate the \\"Lincoln magic\\" at times in her desire to portray the man's \\"political genius\\", but Lincoln's ability to pour oil on troubled waters truly was remarkable and is a model of Presidential leadership.  Goodwin paints on such a broad canvas and includes so many different events and individuals that it should probably not be surprising that her narrative contains a few loose threads and gaps.  Remarkably, her discussion of the Lincoln-Douglas debates says nothing about the Freeport Doctrine and its role as a point of contention between the candidates.  Characters such as General Winfield Scott and Count Adam Gurowski are mentioned numerous times but are never \\"formally\\" introduced to the reader.  The opening 200 or so pages also drag a bit, as Goodwin meticulously traces the lives of the \\"rivals\\" from the beginning.  Those searching for the \\"red meat\\" of political infighting and Cabinet squabbles will have a long wait in store for them if they begin at the beginning.  Overall, though, this is a fine read and a good contribution to the vast literature on the Civil War era.
B0002NRQTS|3.0|While Rush dropped some of the synths and brought back the guitars they also forgot to bring back the rock. This is Rush going adult contemporary and sounds as different from their early '80s output such as Moving Pictures and Signals as Sting's solo work sounds different from the Police. While the songs are sometimes moving such as in War Paint and the lyrics poignant as in The Pass (excellent song about teen suicide), the music is far too often far too lite. And while they don't necessarily fall to the depths of using pop cliche's (other than the overuse of fade outs rather than real endings), neither is this music all that challenging. What you get is melodic, middle of the road music (for Rush) that is way too comfortable and pop for my tastes. The sound of the album is quite trebly also. I can't imagine a fan of the '70s or early '80s Rush or the excitement they could generate liking this cd very much. Presto isn't horrible, there are a couple of gems here, but it's my least favorite cd of theirs. Rush ended the '80s not with a bang, but with the mellowest effort of their career. Thank the gods they brought back the rock with their subsequent and strong album Counterparts.<br /><br />In Presto's favor the first two cuts Show Don't Tell and Chain Lightning are excellent and feature Rush at their loosest, most grooving and jazzy. Geddy plays some marvelous bass and Neil's drumming and Alex's guitar are spot on. Buy it for these tracks, The Pass and War Paint.

B000002J1S|5.0|This is the greatest achievement of the band Genesis. SinceTrespass they had  been building toward a musical monument like this. And here they construct it.    I listen to the album now with deep regret. \\"Lamb\\" shows the innovative directions the band was going in. Back in NYC anticipates electro-rock (like   Gary Numan) by 4 or 5 years; the Eno-esque soundscapes, while dated now, show a desire to experiment; the intense complexity of the songs is offset, unlike in their prior work, by a solid foundation of bass and drums, driving rhythms (just listen to the bass and drums in In the Cage); the songs are generally shorter and more varied in tone and style.     What could have been had they continued down this path ... such remarkable possibilities unrealized. But the creative chemistry of the original line-up was lost when Gabriel left and then, a few years later, Hackett.  Genesis survived the transition into the 1980s, but only by selling themselves by the pound. They collapsed into a pop band.    For me, then, The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, represents the apogee of the Genesis genius, a signpost to a path not taken.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|Does not make sense.    What I look for in a film firstly is the story. This one does not make sense. We have a fictional character living in the same world as the writer that created him. This fictitious character starts hearing voices and goes to a literary professor for help. It is similar to one story that Woody Alan did except with its own twist. For that reason I gave it a score above average.    Most of the acting probably on purpose was wooden. I don't like this style of acting but that maybe me. The only acting I thought was good was Emma Thompson who played the writer and her assistant.     The filming is good.
B000002USN|4.0|By 1993, Frank Sinatra was 77 years old. His voice was in tatters, his memory was failing regularly, and his health was deteriorating. And yet, he was still performing and seeling out houses around the world, playing to audiences young and old.<br /><br />It was this appeal that led Sinatra to return to the studio at the request of his family and friends, and team up with the hottest artists of that era for an album of newly recorded duets of Sinatra classics. The result was simply titled \\"Duets\\".<br /><br />\\"Duets\\" has polarized Sinatra fans since its release. Many fans love it and think of it as a great souvenier for Sinatra's later years. Others despsie it and see it as a joke to milk Sinatra's legacy. I am in the middle. I think \\"Duets\\" is flawed, but it's a very solid and enjoyable album.<br /><br />The artists chosen here are indeed an eclectic bunch, ranging from R & B belters (Aretha Franklin, Luther Vandross) to modern day pop divas (Gloria Estefan, Natalie Cole, Carly Simon, Anita Baker), to a modern day rock icon (Bono), to a schlock king saxophonist (Kenny G), to two foreign crooners (Julio Iglesias, Charles Aznavour), an artsit I've never heard of and a select few who were in the same mold as Frank (Streisand, Tony Bennett, Liza Minelli).<br /><br />With this group of artists, you are bound to get varied results when it comes to the songs. The fact of the matter is, some songs work and some don't.<br /><br />The ones that work really well, and are fortunately the better part of the record. Streisand's performane with Frank on \\"I've Got A Crush On You\\" is irresistibly sweet and playful. Bennett on \\"New York, New York\\" is a dream come true, with the tow greatest singers in their field finally getting together on record. Minnelli was born to sing with Frank just like her mother, and the two swing out on \\"I've Got The World On A String\\". Anita Baker scores well on \\"Witchcraft\\", throwing in some nice scatting, and Carly Simon provides a good counter-vocal to Frank on an aching medley of \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" and \\"In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\\". And while it looked like a bad idea on paper, Bono really blends in well on \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\". Bono clealry respects Frank and does not try and upstage him and the two redefine cool with this track.<br /><br />The bad is not terrible, but is lacking. Gloria Estefan comes across as too over the top on \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\", and Natalie Cole, who had attempted the same feat three years earlier with her dad on \\"Unforgettable\\", is surprsingly weak on \\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\". Luther Vandross is one of my favorite R & B singers, but he fails to ignite sparks on \\"The Lady Is A Tramp\\". The duets with Iglesias (\\"Summer Wind\\") and Aznavour (\\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\"). The biggest disappointment perhaps is Aretha Franklin, who should've been a high point of the record, but she seems disconnected on \\"What Now My Love\\".<br /><br />This leaves us with the last song on the album, which is by definition not a duet, and ironically manages to be the undisputed high point of the album. Kenny G. plays an instrumental version of \\"All The Way\\" (I was really hoping the older Frank would try his hand at this, but its' not to be). After tow minutes of Kenny's sax, the song quietly fades into \\"One For My Baby (And One More For The Road)\\". And the result is amazing. Frank gives the song all he's got, and the wear and tear of his voice gives the song a more poignant and heartbreaking feel to it. It's an incredible recording. I almost cried listening to it.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Duets\\" isn't a masterpiece, but a solid effort from Frank in his final years. It is certainly worth having, even if not's quite a must have.ll Hang My Tears Out To Dry\\" and \\"In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning\\".

B0002IQEHI|5.0|What can I say? This movie is great. It has everything, from intense action and mystery that is built up by the amazing score, to the perfect actors and actresses portraying well written and witty, and sometimes sexy, dialogue. As well as the exoticly filmed locations and that 50-60's style. Recommended for everyone.
B000IJ79WU|5.0|This is the best Superman film ever.I love Donners version of the film more than Lesters.Lesters version is still good but they're missing Jor-El and other things I like about this one.In this one Jor-El is back instead of being replaced by Lara.In this one Lex visits the Fortress(like in lesters)but in this one Marlon Brando actually talks to him.I love it when Lois finds out Clark is Superman because it is funny.Lesters version was not funny but this one is. I also love the deleted scenes and commentary.The deleted scenes tell you what happened to Zod,NON,and Ursla and the commentary is great because director Richard Donner and Tom Mankiewciz talk about the film.I think any true Superman fan should buy this Donner version of Superman 2.
B000J103YI|5.0|If you want to live the Dream, this CD will always be there...     I love this CD...it takes me right through all the emotions and action of the movie. Nothing is left out, all of my favorites are included even the less commercial cuts like Eddie Murphy's \\"Jimmy Got Soul\\" which gives the CD a well rounded feel.
B000PMGNK4|5.0|Not since they pulled out the concept in the first GIS movie that the build up of information at nodes in the sea of information could result in a self maintaining/regulating entity have I been so blown away by an idea in an Anime film.  Batou, Togusa, and the whole gang are on the job, but where is the Major?  Some hard hitting criminal is up to something with people dying or disappearing or simply just being erased from the sea of information.  The Major is missing AND their is a new criminal about, who could it be?    Well, this film take political science fiction to its height, and also does very nicely with the technology and action aspects.  And the ending is friggin phenomenal.  Sure the GIS has always been wonderful with its ability to paint the world in shades of gray, or at least to say that sometimes the black is the better choice over the white, but in this story, the viewer will find it impossible to make a judement call on which side was fighting for the greater good.    BTW, watching these movies in English is pathetic because they choose voices that seem appropriate for Children's Cartoons.  Be serious, GIS is absolutely not for children, if, IF, they can comprehend the concepts being thrown around, there is no way they can actually appreciate them.
B000LC55F2|5.0|A rare case of a movie improving on an already good book.  The Nolan brothers' unique take on Christopher Guest's premise was just what it needed to really blossom.  They found connections and plot points overlooked by the author.  In their hands the story unfolds with a thematic logic reminiscent of a classical composition.  To what lengths will a dedicated artist go in pursuit of their art?  The Nolans' love foreshadowing, reference and metaphor.  Many details accumulate meaning as the movie unfolds.  A simple trick involving a canary; an elderly magician's ability to produce a goldfish bowl from seemingly nowhere; a curious exchange between lovers.      The end is chilling (although in all fairness it is not hard to see it coming).      After a first viewing we decided to watch it again with English subtitles turned on, and I would highly recommend watching it this way.  A third viewing revealed even more of the subtle, nice touches that forward and support the main premise.    The feud at the heart of the movie is not a battle between a good character and a bad one.  I found that refreshing.  The viewer is not pressured into taking sides.      This is one of my top 5 movies of the year.

0425170349|2.0|I usually enjoy reading Clancy's novels, but this must be his worst.  I tried to finish the book, but it took me almost three months.  The story is highly repetitious, with similar incidents throughout the first half of the book.  The prose was too verbose.  The book could have been half the length and would have been better.  Worse yet, Clancy was offbase in his over-eagerness to introduce new technologies, and promoted the DKL Lifeguard (supposedly a human presence detector), which was proven in a later Department of Justice double-blind study to perform no better than random chance, and upon a physical engineering dissection by Sandia National Lab, found to contain a block of plastic with a human hair in it as the active sensing element!  Shame to Mr. Clancy for falling for that. One would have thought that someone who had been exposed to so much hi-tech through all his research would have had better sense.
B000FQ4M58|3.0|If you attach the name \\"Bat out of Hell\\" to an album, you have to accept that it´s being compared to part I and II of those. And that´s a problem. Although acceptable as a pure Meatloaf album and not much worse than let´s say \\"Welcome tt Neighbourhood\\" putting \\"Bat\\" on it makes it a simple case of cashing in on a legend for the last time. No wonder Steinman pulled out of this. What is lacking here is the pure adrenaline the real anger and fear that \\"living on the edge\\" enviroment both Bat I&II had (on Bat one they simply fought to live on music and on Bat II Meatloaf needed a hit to recover from his bancruptcy). Here this is blatant pompous rock by the numbers without soul. The choice of Songs is very bad (B grade Steinman and wannabe Steinman imposters) at the end I was actually expecting \\"Out of the Frying Pan\\" too.     Stay clear of this one. It´s got no soul. So it is of no importance.    And stay clear of Meatloaf live to, he´s lost it somewhere in the last 5 years. I saw him twice and he utterly disappointed me. He should just retire his singing career and concentrate on acting.
B000OVLBEY|1.0|I love Nicolas cage, but this is not his type of movie. He did much better in Face/Off which was some-what comic book like. I didn't sense chemistry between him and Eva the kiss was more like them eating lunch, sloppy and all over the place. I personally don't like Eva, she looks greasy. The villains were no challenge to him, especially the last one. I guess the most powerful is the easiest to kill? I really hope Cage picks better rolls in the future, this and the Wicker Man are killing me.
0618680004|1.0|As I was contemplating my review of this book, I noticed Amazon's \\"Fine Print,\\" which included the statement, \\"If you believe that the product you are reviewing is unsafe, please report this information to the U.S. Consumer Safety Commission\\" and, to tell the truth, I'm R-E-A-L-L-Y tempted.  :-)<br /><br />After reading reviewer Carla Van's description of how this book ended her search for God, I was saddened. Carla obviously read the Old Testament, got mixed messages and confusion, and gave up. Anyone who examines Christianity should first read the New Testament and become thoroughly versed in its concepts before attempting the Old Testament or there is bound to be misunderstanding.  Sadly, this is often the church's fault, because too many believers have a \\"blind faith\\" rather than a faith based on sound reason... which, according to Dawkins, doesn't exist.<br /><br />Dawkins' book repeatedly claims that faith is nothing more than adamant belief with absolutely no supporting evidence. Yet, what he defines is \\"blind\\" faith, not the faith of Christianity.<br /><br />Dawkins insists that the God Hypothesis is a scientific one that should \\"in principle, if not in practice\\" (Dawkins' words) be testable.  Yet, how often is the God Hypothesis even entertained in casual conversation (besides derisively) among those in academia? The reason that the God Hypothesis is \\"in practice\\" untestable is because academics in leadership in research institutions are almost invariably secularists, like Dawkins, as RC Metcalf examines in his book, [[ASIN:0595432646 Letter to a Christian Nation: Counter Point]].<br /><br />Dawkins is a good writer and his book is easy to follow, but his views of Christianity are distorted. Like the rest of the \\"new atheists\\" they build a straw man version of Christianity that is easy to tear down. I would love to see some real dialogue between these fellows and true Christian intellectuals, like William Lane Craig or J.P. Moreland.  What I see instead are atheist produced documentaries (like \\"The God Who Isn't There\\" and \\"The Root of All Evil\\") where the atheists choose which Christians to interview, so as to make themselves look good.<br /><br />If Dawkins was truly intellectually honest he would step forward and ASK to debate some of Christianity's top defenders, rather than take on a popular version of the faith with his other musketeers.atheist produced documentaries (like \\"The God Who Isn't There\\" and \\"The Root of All Evil\\") where the atheists choose which Christians to interview, so as to make themselves look good.<br /><br />If Dawkins was truly intellectually honest he would step forward and ASK to debate some of Christianity's top defenders, rather than take on a popular version of the faith with his other musketeers.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|I don't usually do horror, which is why this is my favorite horror film. I don't care about religion since I don't believe in god, so I don't care about accuracy, you have a good story then I'll like it. I like that Midnight was praying for Constantine and the kid before they went to fight and they laughed at him lol. Why pray like it's gonna help? I like the special effects even though I know they could've been better they're fine. I like ALL they actors they picked out for the movie, and Peter Stormare played an awesome Satan. Some lines were a bit cheesy but the rest of the movie made up for it. I also like the fact that there was no love or kiss scenes, they pulled that off nicely, Keanu and Rachel's chemistry was awesome, and I liked the \\"almost\\" kiss scenes where Constantine was putting a necklace on Angela's neck like an almost kiss. Well done, one of my favorites.
B00005JPFE|5.0|I would rate Ratatouille 1,000 stars if I could, but Amazon must have decided that there was only enough room for 5. This film right here is the most exquisite and perfect piece of animation in history. I went to the special 'sneak preview' showing of the movie and was completely blown away. So many months ago, after my intense disappointment with the very dull movie Cars, the first commercial for this film was the last ounce of hope that I had for Pixar's wellfare. I came into the theater with very very high expectations, and I am very pleased to say that Ratatouille has exceeded these expectations by millions of thousands of points.     The story is top notch and very masterfully woven, like a golden tapestry in a pile of mediocre films that are often in dire need of praise that just won't come. Jan Pikava (I do hope that I'm spelling that right) and Brad Bird, the co-directer and director respectively blew me away with the thought and feeling pulled into this wonderful film. Pikava was the one who came up with the idea of this story and was originally supposed to direct, but Bird came in instead, and frankly I'm glad he did. The first preview was very shoddily done and hideously misleading (as Pikava directed it, no foul damage to him intended), but the film is flawless under Bird's wing.     The actors were wonderful and the characters were grand. Lou Romano, an employee at Pixar, lended his voice to Linguini and made it one of a kind. The design is also very good, especailly the hair animation. How far Pixar has gone from difficulties with the animation of Violet's hair in The Incredibles to the flawless design of these characters' different hair styles. Perfection is upon us now! Janeane Garofalo as Collette was a very good character with very funny speeches and such. Peter O'Toole as Anton Ego the food critic was extrodinarily well done. Patton Oswalt as Remy just topped off the rounds and rounds of excellence.     Jokes were hilarious and very good, only onecrude humor joke was found I think. It is a very friendly film and great for children and adults alike. That's one of the wonderful things about Pixar. Usually, in movies like Shrek, they have stupid little jokes for the children, and crude (and often suggestive) jokes for the adults. With Pixar, the jokes are made so that everyone can laugh at the same joke.    Remember: There are several occasions in the movie when things pop out at you, including the first appreance of Remy when he bursts through a window with a book in his hands. Some scenes can get kind of loud, most notably one with an old lady and a musket...          All in all, Ratatouille is now on top of my favorite movies list. It is a rare and beautiful gem of animation in a sea of failing movies. You have to see it, as it is absolutely magnificent and...well, you go and see it yourself. Yes, I am almost 12, and this film is sure to be well known for years to come.    Sincerely,    ~Dapplewing~
0765316978|3.0|\\"The Last Colony\\" is not up to the level of its predecessors, which were some of the best science fiction- or just plain fiction- I've ever read.  It seemed at times like the author was up against a deadline and cut some corners.  What happened to the werewolf-like natives of Roanoke ?  They receded into the background after one encounter.  And the book suffers from some atrocious editing- Croatan is repeatedly misspelled, and there are too many sentences containing simple grammatical errors.  I wish Scalzi could have taken more time with these great characters and sent them out in style.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|I've been eagerly awaiting the release of each new Rush album over the years since Grace Under Pressure and I've always been immediately taken by at least a few tunes every time. So many songs would just jump out and be remembered the very first time I heard them. By the second listen I would start to like some of them more & more picking up on some subtleties of the lyrics or understanding the structure of the song, noticing the changes in the tempos, etc. all the while hearing them become Rush Classics the more & more you heard them.  Anyway, this trend ending with Test For Echo for me & I was hoping to be impressed again with this new release. Besides hearing Far Cry on the radio in advance, I listened to the whole album once and absolutely nothing stood out! I really didn't know what I heard the first time through. I could not recall any single point of any song that really wanted me to go back and find it again.    It's taken me a few listens to begin to like a few songs, mainly Spindrift and the instrumental The Main Monkey Business. I think the problem for me is that the sound just isn't clean enough or different enough. Most of the album just flows by sounding pretty much the same which has never been the case in a Rush album before. Maybe the production should be blamed for everything sounding muddled together & on top of each other. The \\"Rush sound\\" for me has always been the drums sort of driving the song but always working well with Alex's guitar and Geddy's vocals. There has always been a clear sound to each, working hand in hand but not overpowering each other. The bass & lead guitars have always complemented each other in the past especially on early albums like Farewell..., Fly by Night, Caress... , & 2112. This time around it sounds like they are doing their own thing without hearing each other. I've read other reviews of Snakes & Arrows that say Rush has returned to an earlier sound or an earlier way of recording & I really don't know what they aretalking about. I don't hear it. I think the best reflection of their old style was the cover songs on Feedback like Crossroads & Seeker because they played those songs 30 years ago.    Despite this disappointing release I am looking forward to seeing the tour this summer. Rush has never failed to perform a song live at least as good the recording. Maybe this time they can do even better.
B00005JL78|4.0|While I've never been a Tom Cruise fan, he is good in this movie, bearable even, and it's extremely entertaining.  It's refreshing to see a science fiction movie presenting an interesting idea rather than a series of special effects. Here, the special effects serve the story, and with Spielberg involved you can expect it to be done well, which it is.    This is one of those movies where I don't think it's necessary to know more than the basic premise, so I won't go into the story.    I highly recommend this.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is the type of movie that keeps you guessing and keeps you in \\"wonder\\" throughout the movie. The writer took some time to think about what should be told and when. I do love period pieces and really loved this one. It is a thriller, drama, romance and mystifying movie all rolled into one. The acting was excellent especially Edward Norton's role. He was well cast in this role and fit into to a tee. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that likes period pieces with a little mystery mixed in.
B000ICM5MG|5.0|This is a must for any collection. I can watch this movie a hundered times and never get bored with it.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|This album is friggin' awesome. It's worth buying for the first two tracks alone.    In my opinion, the first couple songs are what bands like Trivium and Shadows Fall *wish* they could play like. Amazing music, lyrics, and vocal delivery.    What I really like about this CD is not every song is played 10,000 MPH. I'm too old for that now. I like it when bands show they can rock the slow jams too. I like some variation.    It's a great all around CD. Even better than \\"The System Has Failed.\\"    Again, Dave shows he's the best metal guitarist out there. He's an amazing song writer, guitar player, and singer.    ~Slick
B00005JPHT|2.0|Since Michael doesn't mind, I saw this movie for free.  Hi, Harvey!!<br /><br />Michael raises some interresting points about our health care system, but like his other movies, doesn't offer any opposing viewpoints that are presented as just as valid as his.  Such a thing would provide, dare I say it, CONTEXT.<br /><br />His visit to Cuba is complete BS.  Wow, Cuba has fantastic health care.  They also don't have to worry about pesky things like elections and free speach.<br /><br />Tell the WHOLE story, Michael.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I never saw Rocky VI in the theaters late last year, but learned about it through DVD. I have watched it over 8 times and I am just amazed by it and cannot believe it did not get the attention it deserved.  I guess the only saving grace is that for the most part, critics understood the movie, and had a soft spot in their heart for it.  Movies are to entertain but to some directors/actors, the goal is to make a difference, to make a point.  The way Rocky handled himself through the movie, through the depths of despair, while also facing the reality of his own aging, Rocky shows us how to rise above it all \\"The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows\\" he says, \\"It's a very mean and nasty place... and I don't care how tough you are, it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently, if you let it. Not you, me or nobody, is gonna hit as hard as life. But it ain't about how hard you hit... It's about how hard you can get hit, and keep moving forward... it's about how much you can take, and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done. Now, if you know what you're worth, go out and get what your worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits. And not pointing fingers saying: \\"You ain't what you wanna be because of him or her or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that!\\"<br /><br />It is that single seen that allowed me to begin to deal with my own father's death and realize, \\"life sucks in so many ways, but fight it, don't let it knock you down, if you don't get up, life will keep you on the ground, permanently!<br /><br />Bravo Rocky!  Bravo Stallone! Thank you so much.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Lots of action and great special effect!  5 stars!!!
B000002N9L|5.0|When I first heard this LP, I didn't know what to think.<br />  I listened to it a second time and I was hooked.<br />  This was supposed to be a \\"throw-away\\" lp.  It is one of my 5 all-time fave Prince works.<br /> \\"Dinner With Delores,\\" the title track, \\"Same December\\"...great music from a Hall of Fame musician.
0618871713|5.0|I had never read a graphic novel and I was unable to put this one down! The concise storytelling/\\"storydrawing\\" is incredible. Wow!
B0006Z2LH4|5.0|Best sequal to the amazing origional.  This film is just as good as the origional classic.  Great effects, lots of awesome traps, and no CGI.  Awesome.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|Being written and directed by John Waters and Johnny Depp not playing a gay drunken pirate is all this movie needs to be good. Add the fact that Cry Baby is an original version of the cliched movies that have the same plot as Grease. John Waters is a modern day critic of American society and his movies add comedy to the criticism. All his movies are classics and Cry Baby is no different.   <br />The DVD features Commetary by John Waters, deleted scenes, and \\"It Came From Baltimore\\" which is a behind the scenes Featurette. The price is good the movie is great, what is stopping you from buying this?
B000002GKT|5.0|I bought this release as a 2 record set in the fall of '72 and it has remained a favorite ever since. The tones and performances are totally in a league of their own especially the late,great Steve Marriott. From the first notes of \\"Four Day Creep\\" to his  singing, playing and arranging skills of \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" you know this was a man on a mission.<br /><br />And about those amps;no frazzy \\"Brown Sound\\" BS here. No complex signal chains of wah>od/dist>chorus>delay>reverb here. Just majestic non-master Marshalls running at near red-line with the eq's set for maximum impact, again especially Steve. His intro to \\"Rolling Stone\\" gives a clinic on grind. Just unbelievable.<br /><br />Peter Frampton is also amazing throughout. Dig his early lead on \\"Rolling Stone\\". Man, the notes explode from the speakers.<br /><br />The overall band sound is awesome as well with Jerry Shirley on the drums and the late Greg Ridley on bass filling out the mix perfectly. Steve's vocals are to me unparalled though. I don't think I have any other cds or albums where I listen to the vocals with the same intensity as the playing. His banter with the audience on \\"Rolling Stone\\" is great. I love how he calls the audience out-\\"You want to sing it,come on and sing it!!!!YEAAAHHH!!!\\" What a showman!<br /><br />Jamming faves for me are \\"I'm Ready\\" and \\"Stone Cold Fever\\". I love Peter's melodic style on these tracks. From what I read years ago he made a concious effort not to sound like Clapton and I think it paid off as his leads are as unique as they are awesome.<br /><br />I love how the band wraps up \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" with Peter playing over the ascending chord figure. Man, I damn near tear-up just thinking about it.(what can I say,I GET IT!) If you haven't already you should get it ,too. A must have for any rock fan.
B0009X7664|5.0|Why ban them? Then, we might be spared what is possibly the most infantile, ignorant and uninformed collection of negative reviews present on Amazon.<br /><br />I originally intended to post a review a few weeks ago after I had viewed it on cable, but for some reason I decided to read the negative views first(both book and movie) to see why or how anyone could condemn either. It became a laugh or cry situation. I opted for forced laughter.<br /><br />A few examples of the absurd negative comments follow (with my own comments in parenthesis):<br /><br />\\"Every copy of this book should be burned and never allowed to be read again.\\" (Ah, the sweet smell of scorched paper around the bonfires. Armbands optional?)<br /><br />\\"Yuk! Try to avoid reading this book as much as possible. . . . [I]t is confusing . . . and there is too much information given at one time.\\" (You had me at \\"Yuk!\\")<br /><br />\\"Thanks to all my friendswho had to tourchure threw reading this disgrace and supporting me in not likeing the book. By the way, DO NOT BUY, because if i find it in your house i won't think to kindly of you.\\" (I tremble in terror and weep in shame at what you would think of my bookshelves.)<br /><br />\\"Talk about a bad movie i would only buy it if someone paid me twice it's value to.\\" (I don't think this is what was meant by the \\"new math.\\")<br /><br />And, my favorite: \\"Do not watch, do not read ... stay ignorant of Harper Lee.\\" (I suspect, young reader, that you have succeeded far beyond Harper Lee.)<br /><br />Sorry to review the reviews, but now I actually have something serious to say about the movie and book.<br /><br />Years before the publication of Harper Lee's novel, there was a trial in a small southern Mississippi town in 1945. A black man named Willie McGee was accused of the rape of a white woman. The circumstantial evidence pointed strongly to the possibility that the relationship was forced by the woman. Just as in \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" such a relationship at the time could not - would not - be tolerated. The case attracted national attention at the time, and after a prolonged series of appeals (spearheaded by former New York Congresswoman, Bella Abzug), a public execution was staged, which was no more than a legally sanctioned lynching. The state's portable electric chair was installed in the courthouse, which was filled to standing room only. Outside spectators climbed trees to gain a look at the execution through the opened windows. (A white Mississippi attorney, Dixon Pyles, also took part in the defense, so Atticus Finch is not without a foundation in fact.)<br /><br />The Scottsboro trials have been cited as the main inspiration for Lee's novel, but I've often wondered if the McGee trial might not also have played a role. But it really doesn't matter. Fiction is often more suited to tell the truth than history. And the truth is that although many people in the South knew Jim Crow laws and lynchings were wrong, they also knew that if you were vocal about it, you could lose your job - or your life, which is what makes the portrait of Atticus Finch a true profile in courage, a Southern Gothic version of Sir Thomas Moore in \\"A Man For All Seasons.\\"<br /><br />But beyond the racial themes, both the book and the movie weave a gentle tapestry of what life in the South was like before air-conditioning, where games were things to be played outdoors rather than in front of computers, a discarded tire was an endlessly renewable resource for entertainment and summers seemed to last forever.  (I've lived what I'm talking about.)<br /><br />What saddens me about the negative reviews such as I quoted above is not their ignorance, but the lack of curiosity they display about our nation's history. I do, however, hope that the young reviewer who urged the burning of all copies of the book is oblivious of the historical events he or she evoked and will someday realize the horror of what such comments endorse.<br /><br />Ten stars ifI could.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|So much has been written about Vincente Minnelli's MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS, and I wouldn't be at all surprised to find that I'm hardly being original in observing that one of the benefits the film provides a contemporary viewer is that it offers a \\"double dose\\" of nostalgia--both for a time that virtually no one currently alive can remember (the turn of the LAST century) and for the golden era of Hollywood musicals (which significantly more certainly can).  Both appear to have been simpler, more innocent times.  And therein lies much of this classic musical's appeal.    Non-ironic nostalgia has been a tough sell in Hollywood for decades now, in no small part due to this film's star herself.  The all-too-familiar tragedy of Judy Garland's life and death casts something of a pallor over the good cheer and sentiment of many of her early films.   The charm of a film, wherein a family's biggest problem is that they may have to move from their beloved home town if the pater familias accepts a promotion might begin to pale compared to the real life drama of its star, who in later life almost lost her home to the IRS.  And let's not even get started on Judy's real life \\"boys next door.\\"    In some ways, though, the complexities of Judy Garland's real life--and our own--actually serve to make this film all the more poignant.  You might wonder if the driven young Judy Garland of 1944 didn't herself yearn for the simpler life of a turn-of-the-century Mid-Western belle like Esther Smith, whose life seems to revolve around tennis matches, trolley rides and lively social gatherings--and lots and lots of occasions to sing her heart out.  Which is never a bad thing.    That three of the movies songs (\\"The Boy Next Door,\\" \\"The Trolley Song,\\" and \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas\\") would become concert staples for Judy throughout her career should count for something.  You could say that St. Louis provided her with more of her standard repertoire than Oz ever did.  Moreover, all the numbers are beautifully shot, as is the entire movie.  Vincente Minnelli was justly lauded for his visual sensibility, and it was never better realized than in this gorgeous film.    One of the ironies about the great Hollywood musicals is that often the best of the breed had the slightest of plots.  It's significant that Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli's own daughter Liza had HER biggest success with the much darker, infinitely more cynical neo-musical CABARET.  But even at its most willfully innocent, MEET ME AT ST. LOUIS hints at things that are darker and scarier than the day-to-day bustle of hearth and home.  The genuinely spooky Halloween sequence reminds us that our childhood innocence is also beset with childhood fears.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Saw the first installment of this series and knew I had to have it.  Incredible photography, and David Attenborough is always great.
0099413140|5.0|To really appreciate the humour in this book, you need to know the Queen. While it's a cute story of the queen's underwear, it's also a great way to have fun discussions with your child about the different kinds of underwear there is, and even come up with some ideas of your own. I loved it, my 4yr old loves it and it's often picked as a bedtime story.
1596912855|4.0|I am definitely a fan of Austen, and especially Mr. Darcy so I was very excited to hear about this book. It's a quick read, and while I wish it was longer, it was enjoyable to read the story of a woman who longs for a good man. I loved her struggles to fit in, and I loved the little Austen references. Overall, I really liked this book.
B00005YTN5|5.0|It has to be historically accepted that The Velvet Underground & Nico is one of the most inspirational and crucial albums ever made in rock 'n' roll history.  This new deluxe edition has great additional features with Nico's voice as well as fine mono versions of the stereo versions of the original album.  This album was released before other masterpieces of other groups were released.  Examples are the following:  The Beatles-Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, The Doors(self-titled album), Pink Floyd-Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and Jimi Hendrix-Are You Experienced?  However, hardly sold; it only reached 199 on the charts.  Well, it just goes to show that commercial success and artistic merit do not always go hand in hand.    This album has one of the most groundbreaking songs of all time, \\"Heroin\\".  It starts off quiet and slow, then it goes faster during the first verse.  During the second and third verses, it does the same thing.  Then, in the fourth verse where Lou Reed sings 'Heroin', John Cale starts to play his viola like a buzzing chainsaw.  He does this until Lou Reed sings the last line of the song, 'Oh and I guess that I just don't know'.  Finally, the song is fairly calm and slow again.  All of this is execeptional for this avant-garde type of music.  All the songs on this album are great.  A few in particular which I like besides \\"Heroin\\" are \\"Venus in Furs\\", \\"I'm Waiting For My Man\\", \\"Run, Run, Run\\", \\"All Tomorrow's Parties\\", \\"The Black Angels Death Song\\", and \\"European Son\\".  Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, Maureen Tucker, and Nico demonstrate that you do not need to play exact same instruments over and over again or have a clean and clear signing voice to be a fine rock 'n' roll band.  They were the kind of musicians who thought outside the box and challenged the way rock 'n' roll should be played.      Lou Reed is one of the first artists to treat rock 'n' roll as an art.  He uses just about any kind of instruments in his songs as well as writing poetic lyrics.  We should get back to the song \\"Heroin\\".    In the first verse he sings,              'I don't know just where I'm going               But I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can               'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man               When I put a spike into my vein               Then I tell you things aren't quite the same                When I'm rushing on my run               And I feel like Jesus' son               And I guess that I just don't know               And I guess that I just don't know'  In my opinion, Lou gives you an impression or surreal situation about what a person experiences and feels after he/she injects heroin inside his/her body.  Do doubt has this song changed songwriting from then on!    This band is extremely fortunate to have a man like Andy Warhol as their friend and motivator. He designed an innovative album jacket.  You see this white album with Andy Warhol's name and a banana on the front.  In the upper right hand corner, you read, 'Peel Slowly and See'.  Then when you do peel it open, you expect to see something vulgar like a penis.  Yet it turns out to be a pink banana.  Gotcha!    Well, I would say that since its release in March of 1967, it has gradually had a huge influence on musicians that would follow:  The Stooges, Queen, KISS, Talking Heads, Patti Smith, The New York Dolls, Blondie, The Ramones, Television, Jane's Addiction, Nine Inch Nails, INXS, Devo, Marilyn Manson, Sonic Youth, REM, David Bowie, U2, Jesus and Mary Chain, and others.  This is why I think this is one of the places where modern rock started!
B00011RPB0|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it's disappointing that people made such a big deal over it. Isolation, I get it.   But, seriously...what is the point, and the awkward script leaves so much to be desired. I wonder if Sophia would be allowed to make movies if she had a different last name? Is she just trying to be weird, and find some weird niche? Yes, her dad was ground breaking, so I guess those are big shoes to fill...but, then maybe you just should'nt try.   The movie is boring, with little dialogue, and you don't really care what happens with the character. The setting is boring, and the movie overall is weak.
B000A6T1KE|3.0|its not the worst film I've ever seen. (a few Spoilers below)  The main problems are that the story doesn't hold up to being made as a movie. I could have seen this as a special mini series or something. Everything seemed so THROWN together at the last minute and there were many gaps on continuity from DS9 and the original TNG. I hated the idea of Worf leaving his position with the Klingons to stay with Star Fleet knowing he can never move up in position, no possible way for him to be promoted ever...yet this movie makes it seem like he is doing just that. I liked the idea of him staying with the Klingons as was shown in the last episode of DS9.   What helped me give this movie 3 stars is that the deleted scenes made the movie better in my opinion, and should have been included. That shot with Spot and Worf answered my question as to what would be done with his things and what ever happened to Spot (though I can't see Worf keeping him...they should have had Deanna in the room with Spot and Spot going to her that would have been touching and more plausible). I liked seeing Admiral Janeway too, really helped bring the shows together.  Also it was nice how the extended ending had a new XO come on board and that joke with the captain's chair was nice.   Without the extras, however, I would only give this 2 stars. It was a disappointment for a true fan of the ST universe.
B000O76TA4|5.0|Fight Club....so fresh when it came out, and still so. Man, the action, the comedy, the drama.....and so so so so well put together. Ed Norton has a very controlled, boringly normal, compulsively square life. Then he joins a fight club, and Brad Pitt (smokin hot in this movie...it had to be said) steps into his life. I don't want to give away any twists or turns, but I will just say that while a little violent, the movie is amazing to watch. It's so well acted, and adventerous, and like nothing else you'll see.
B000N6TX1I|2.0|The story is unusual and needs more explanation in the film. Why did every woman on earth stop having babies? The firearms skirmishes were the only excellent part of this film.<br /><br />My major gripe ... the film quality is very grainy on DVD and I was hugely disappointed with this - the film looks very poor on our large LCD TV, even using an SD DVD Oppo upscaler.<br /><br />Overall, I think they should have cut a better quality picture on DVD. This ruins the film and no .... I'm not rushing out like a good little punter to get an HD system. So the ploy failed. If this was supposed to be \\"creatively\\" poor quality film, then the Director should reserve this kind of work for art studios and friends, not mass market.
B000K7VHQE|3.0|Little Miss Sunshine is a story of a family that makes a cross country trip for a pagent for their young daughter. Along the way, they encounter personal tragedy, and the loss of a family member. You won't find to many movies like this, it's odd, and awkwardly times humor make it funny, yet uncomfortable. It's not the warm, happy ending, family fold back together type of movie, but you do get some feel-good sense out of it. There are a few moments that make you laugh, but otherwise for me it's not a comedy. It's awkward, and unreal. Again, I am not the biggest Toni Collette fan either, but I think she is less awkward here than in anything else I've ever seen her in. Interesting, and strange- but not for everyone, and not my favorite.
0465011047|5.0|Abject stories of horror are difficult to take in.  We sometimes turn aside when reading the horror because our minds find it hard to digest the bleak facts.<br /><br />While this book is filled with horrors -- families torn asunder, abuse of pregnant women, torture by prison guards, among many other recountings -- the story is still told with humanity and grace, and ultimately ends with hope, if not happiness.<br /><br />The story of such regimes as North Korea must be told.  And because we are inclined to forget, the story must be told over and over, so that we are not fooled by the lies of the North, the excuses made by the North's apologists, and the occasional public smiles of Kim Jong-il.<br /><br />This is a well-written, engaging story.  I don't easily rate an item with 5 stars, but this deserves the 5 and more.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|What is not to love about this movie? I am a huge Hugh Grant fan. His charming, self-depreciating humor, mixed with his accent is always a win for me, I honestly did not know he was in it when I saw this movie by accident the first time. Love Actually is a story with a lot of moving parts. There are about 8 different stories going on at once, different types of love, of love stories....siblings taking care of one another, new love, infedility, unrequited love, loss of a spouse, first love....and all the stories are intertwined in a perfect quilt of a story. It won't lose you though....don't worry about that. It's easy to watch, and funny, and true. The cast is amazing, Hugh Grant, Collin Firth, Keira Knightley, and more. They way people relate to each other is odd, true and striking, and it just seems to resonate the love people feel for each other above anything else. Love actually is....all around.   Besides, who doesn't like to see cute Hugh Grant shaking his tail to the 80's hit \\" Jump\\"?     CAUTION- there are some partly nude scenes in here. I've had some friends tell me they let their kids watch not realizing. It's otherwise a great movie, it's a shame for the nude scenes because it's otherwise a good movie for the family. But, the nature of the nudity is pretty funny...just probably not the best thing for young viewers.
0385335989|5.0|Loved it!!!  These characters reach out and invite you into their lives, loves, hurts. I can get enough of this series!!!
B00005JKG9|5.0|If you've ever worked in sales then this movie will be instantly recognizable to you.  Sales, especially commission-based sales, with all of it's epic highs and crushing lows, are the stuff of dreams.  Anyone who's worked in any type of sales will recognize the characters portrayed in this movie;  one day you're on a hot streak, master of your universe, and management can't stop telling you how great you are...then before you know it you're in a cold streak where you can't give product away and you stink so bad of failure that no one wants to be around you.  It's no wonder that the highest paid people in the world are people who are really good at sales.  It's also no wonder that this script drew such an all-star cast of actors; the dialogue is undeniably real because of the mix of desperation and cockiness.  Buy it, live it, sell it...and always be closing.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is truly one of the most astounding visual works I have ever witnessed. BBC Planet Earth is a video dairy of the planet, and it covers everything: from the vastness of the antarctic, to the depths of the most beautiful caves, to the height of the Himalaya Moutains. There is footage in this series which has never been shot before, but is able to be shot due to special technology used by BBC. This technology allowed the camera crew to film wildlife up to a mile away from a helocopter, while being zoomed in feet from the animal, and still retaining high definition filming. This provides a revolutionary look at animals in their natural, undisturbed habitats. It's as if you were right along side the animals.     The pictures are absolutely breathtaking. Planet Earth gives us a way of looking at our planet like never before, and truly shows the grandure and majesty of Earth's wildlife and geography.
B000NVT0RU|4.0|As a military history buff, I must first say that I am pleased that a film was made at all about this subject, which is little known by most people,especially Americans.  World War II was the swan song of the old \\"Armee D'Afrique\\", the French colonial army that was similiar in many ways to the British Indian Army of the Raj. Since the vast bulk of metropolitan Frenchmen were under German occupation, or in German POW camps as a result of the defeat in 1940, the bulk of any French Army had to consist of the North African Regiments, from Algeria, Morocco, and Tunisia, along with Senegalese and other colonial troops.   Anyone who has read the book \\"France, Soldiers, and Africa\\" will not be surprised by the events depicted in this movie; the treatment of the \\"native\\" troops was often shameful and ungrateful, despite their sacrifices on the battlefield, for a country that most had never seen.  The acting I believe was generally good, but the characters were not as fleshed out as I would like; perhaps as result of the number of major characters portrayed. The first set piece battle scene had large numbers, but was weakly drawn, and not that coherent; the final action scenes were better, in my opinion. Uniforms and equipment seemed to be reasonably authentic, but a mention of the U.S. 37th Division was incorrect; the 36th Division would have been correct, but I nit-pick.  Could the film have been improved upon? Yes, but the fact that was done at all, and reasonably well, made it well worth my time.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have to confess to having been amongst that group of people who had doubts about Daniel Craig as the new Bond, though not as vitriolically as some. I didn't know much about Craig as an actor, and wasn't sure if a Blonde Bond would work. While I'm not one of those dyed-in-the-wool types who think Sean Connery is the only Bond there'll ever be, I wasn't sure if Craig would work. Having heard that Clive Owen had turned down the part was disappointing, and as I started to warm to Pierce Brosnan (especially in \\"Die Another Day\\", probably his best performance in the role), the casting of a relative unknown was troubling.     I am glad to say, however, that Daniel Craig, as the new, grittier Bond, is a revelation. There is substance beneath the style, and with just enough nods to past Bonds and the series' mythology for it to keep all followers happy. The gadgetry and humor have been toned down this time out, but it's not just mindless action either, there's solid drama as well, as the neophyte 'Double O' learns the ropes.     Judi Dench gives her usual stellar performance, and Eva Green is interestingly different than some of the previous 'ornamental' Bond girls. Mads Mikkelsen is less of a cartoon villain than most of his predecessors and the plot, while still fantasy land for most of us, is all too believable in this day and age.     If the producers can maintain this level of quality, then the Bond franchise looks set to continue its run as the most successful in history.
B000NQR7KM|5.0|I've waited a few weeks to offer up an opinion on this release, because there is so much to compare. One disc has a SACD layer that plays in stereo and 5.1 surround. There is a standard CD layer as well. On the second disc there are two more surround versions; in DTS and Dolby Digital. And then there is the \\"Definitive Edition Series\\" remaster from 1994. I've listened to the different versions many times. So, which one sounds best?    I prefer the SACD surround. The sound is very clear, more so than you have ever heard before. There really is no reason to use the stereo SACD layer (unless you only have two speakers), as the surround mix uses the rear speakers sparingly. I'm sure that the engineer, Nick Davis, intended it to be that way. You don't notice the surrounds most of the time, unless you turn them off. They just provide a fuller sound than the stereo version. I heard that Peter Gabriel sent Nick Davis back to redo at least some of the Lamb Lies Down on Broadway mix because he felt that Davis was being too conservative. Of course Mr. Gabriel had no say in this mix.    The SACD is not perfect, however. I hear a lot of talk about \\"compression\\" from people who think that the extended range sounds unrealistic. I'm not sure if that is fair, although Phil Collins' voice is much more \\"front and center,\\" and the cymbals on the percussion are quite pronounced; much more so than on the prior remaster. This is one of my favorite albums, but it is not my favorite surround recording. I do prefer it over the prior remaster, however. I just wish that I could say that this new one \\"blows away\\" the old one, and I can't. I am sure that vinyl lovers might tend to even prefer the 1994 release, which sounds softer (they would say \\"warmer,\\" I'm sure). The details are there in the older mix, it just doesn't sound as bright as the newer SACD (or the CD, for that matter). Remember, the 1994 release was a remaster itself, and it was a good one. If you compare the new CD mix with the older one, the new mix is much louder (which have led some to the rush judgment that they are hearing more detail). Louder does not, necessarily, mean that it is better. I don't see the new CD mix as much of an improvement.     The DTS 96/24 mix on the DVD was surprisingly good. In fact, for those who think that the SACD mix is too bright, the DTS might be more appealing. It is not as detailed, however. On my system, the low end was \\"fatter.\\" This made the heavier songs like Squonk and Dance on a Volcano sound quite good. On the other hand, Entangled was less impressive. The Dolby Digital surround version was probably the worst of the three surround mixes: brighter, but less detailed. I felt that it was a little harsh.     The extras were great: a \\"mini concert\\" circa 1976, a short interview with the band about the circumstances surrounding the recording of the album, and even a couple of videos. (Does anyone know the replacement singer that the band rejected in favor of Collins? It is not revealed in the interview...) Bottom line here is that if you have a SACD player, this is the version to get. I can't understand why people who don't are paying extra for this version when the U.S. version doesn't cost more that a standard CD.
B000L9IUPM|5.0|The Eagles, what else can one say?  These guys are unbelievably good, their music holds very high quality standards, it's always played very well and they (much like Pink Floyd, the other unbelievably good band) manage to maintain their high quality even live, and this DVD is a brilliant demonstration of it.  I am incredibly inspired by these guys, their songwriting, their melodies, their arrangements, and so on....  After I heard this version of \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" I was in tears it was so beautiful (although I liked Hell Freezes Over's version of the song much better because of Felder's solos), and I got chills down my spine for the incredible live version of Henley's \\"Boys Of Summer\\",  but really to mention favorites here is purely pointless, for this is a rare gem where EVERY SINGLE TRACK is good, and it is extremely rare, at least for a seasoned musician with a very refined ear like me, to find disks that are this good from beginning to end.  Only two regrets, the absence of Don Felder and the fact that this DVD isn't also a CD, so I am incapable of playing it in my car.  This CD should have 10 stars, and not only 5.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Will Ferrel movies tend to be a bit hit and miss, but \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is a bit of a hit in my opinion. I had no idea what to expect, and it was a nice movie. I am not entirely sure why, but I rather enjoyed the creative and quirky plotline.<br /><br />Harold Crick, (Ferrell), is an IRS agent who is pretty much ruled by numbers and is a bit of a whizz at maths. His relatively normal life gets a shift into left field when he starts hearing a voice narrate his life in his head. The narrator is author Karen Eiffel, (Thompson), whose latest novel revolves around the main character, Harold Crick. Harold's attempts to deal with the voice and his life are the unfolding story.<br /><br />With a cast of pretty famous faces, \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" poses some interesting questions and hyoptheticals to think about. It is a creative and interesting premise that had a lot of potential for exploitation, which I think the movie did rather well.<br /><br />I was, like another reviewer, a bit disappointed with the end. It seemed a little forced, though I will not spoil the ending for other potential viewers. I just thought a variant ending would have worked in better with the movie's overall direction.<br /><br />That issue aside, I thought it was a fine movie, and one of Will Ferrell's better ones. It was certainly much better than the [[ASIN:B000ASDFGI Bewitched (Special Edition)]] trash. \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" is a humorous and endearing movie, and one that I would definitely see again.
B000O76T90|5.0|Because of the fact that the new Die Hard movie is coming out, 20th Century Fox has discontinued the GREAT Special Edition DVD's of the first three Die Hard DVD'S, and are replacing them with newly-packaged one-disc versions with only half of those original DVD's features. This DVD, the Special Edition Steelbook, is the only DVD that Fox has just released worth buying, because it is a repackaged edition of the original Two-Disc Special Edition of Die Hard. Hopefully Fox will do the same thing with the other Die Hard movies.    Bottom Line: Forget the new Die Hard boxset, get this instead and wait for the other ones.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|Great extra features, nice clean print of the now \\"classic\\" film
1592220045|3.0|My copy of this novel is from February 1986.  The credits show each of the six shorties therein having appeared in the period 1976-1985 in various years inside Analogue and/or Andromeda magazines.  While effort was made in getting the six short stories to mesh together, they didn't mesh well.  The timeline is played fast and loose, and those cats of Tuff are ancient by the end of the novel.  At one point they are referred to as 'kittens' when they are five years old.    This book was written decades ago, and the writing quality inside is nothing compared to what George R.R. Martin has achieved in his 'Song of Fire and Ice' series.  Even though he wrote em, it was close to 30 years ago, so don't get your hopes up.    As for the stories themselves, I enjoyed the first one (for intrigue) and last (for what defines a god).  The dueling plagues in the 'Moses' story I found pretty stupid, and the others didn't have strong themes or points.   Note they were *stories*, not chapters in a novel.      Tuf as a character has no romantic interests at all, is unflappably robotic, and quirky about human contact.  Cat loving with obstinate politeness and a desire to help people was my post-novel impression.  Other characters in the stories are not really relevant, this is a Tuf-centric collection.    Should you get this?  As a novel it didn't do much for me.  It is an average AND dated sci-fi read.  Martin keeps talking about planets running out of petroleum, and mentions punching numbers into a wrist computer.  If you like vintage sci-fi short stories, go ahead and buy the softcover.  If you really love cats, then you'll probably want to buy hardcover.  It is my personal opinion that much better sci-fi books and George R.R. Martin novels are out there.
0375707972|5.0|Reading out loud is a very important experience for the title character in Bernhard Schlink's novel \\"The Reader\\", a man named Michael Berg. The first time he does so is when he reads \\"The Odyssey\\" for Hanna, a 36 year-old woman to whom he became a lover when he was 15. But those were hard times, and he took young to assume this affair, and the couple falls apart when she vanishes for no apparent reason.<br /><br />Michael will find Hanna again years later, but them both are different people. He is a law student following a process of war crimes, and she is accused of being responsible for the death of many prisoners when she was a guard in a concentration camp. He is astonished to learn that the woman he once loved was capable of such atrocity. She, on the other hand, doesn't seem care to be taken as a scapegoat so that the other guards can be found innocent.<br /><br />\\"The Readers\\" is a novel written with urgency and passion - two features that don't seem to come along very easily. But Schlink can combine them both easily when he creates very believable characters. The passion between Hanna and Michael is at the same time touching and endearing. He is just a teenager having his personal sexual awakening, while she is a mature woman seeking for comfort.<br /><br />Michael is a son of the generation who was too young to know which side their parents took during the War. This gap between child and father arises at some point in \\"The Reader\\". This is only one of the points that Schlink brings up in his book.<br /><br />The writer's style is reminiscent of 19th century post-romantic with a fairy tale spin - except for the happily ever after. His novel seeks a dialogue between past and present without being revisionist. It is above all honest when dealing with Germany's most painful scar.<br /><br />In his life, Michael will become a reader one more time. And this is a very beautiful event to the narrative that ties two loose ends and closes the circle of his story with Hanna.
B000002513|5.0|Springsteen's second album is a collective of many styles that eventually coalesces into a completely unique musical form.  No band has sounded the same as Bruce and co. back in '73.  Now, we've all heard the accusation (thanks Dave Marsh!) about how this recording, as well as the first, was  supposedly damaged by the \\"hamfisted\\" drumming of Vini Lopez.  This needs to be addressed. I've been a drummer for 23 years and I can tell every drummer out there to TRY, just TRY to duplicate the energetic twists and turns of Lopez's drumming on this recording (particularly \\"Kitty's Back\\" and \\"Rosalita\\")!! The dynamism of his playing compliments the variation and shifting nature of the music perfectly.     For me, it's exactly the explosive energy of Lopez that gives this, as well as the first album, a manic intensity that was lost when Bruce decided to oust Lopez for whatever reasons that remain cloudy to this day.  Don't listen to the naysayers who haven't a clue how play drums in the first place, just listen to this recording and enjoy excellent songs, great production and most of all BRILLIANT drumming from \\"Mad Dog\\" Lopez!
B000NVIGC0|1.0|In all fairness, the one-star rating has more to do with what this record SHOULD be than what it is.    That said, I honestly can't understand why more people aren't furious with the last two Wilco studio records---other than the possibility that the band (rightly) built-up so much goodwill from previous efforts that (sadly) very few people are listening to them OBJECTIVELY anymore.     While \\"A Ghost Is Born\\" sounded like the work of an ego in serious need of being brought down a peg or two, this latest feeble effort sounds like Tweedy's become the new Paul Westerberg. Which is to say that the fundamental songcraft may still be there---but he's been utterly abandoned by his creative muse. There's just no JOY in the music anymore.    It's no coincidence this depressing downturn coincided with the decision to eject Jay Bennett from the band. Which is why we can only hope Jeff will eventually extract his head from the dark, smelly place---and beg Jay to come back to the band: Wilco's just a shell of its former self without him.     So maybe the proper analogy is this: Jeff without Jay is David (Byrne) without Tina, Chris and Jerry, or Sting without Andy and Stewart (or your choice of bandleader gone solo with disastrous results).    In any case, for my money, that's what Jeff and Wilco are these days: Without.
1558216847|2.0|This book is almost certainly NOT TRUE!  I am unhappy that the front cover says \\"true story\\" as it has been shown the story is not true.  As written in the other comments, the BBC has researched this and has strong evidence of it not being true.  The fact there is no evidence supporting the story is susipicous to me, there is no prison or hospital records of the trek and no word from his fellow trekkers in the intervening years!  I feel a little gullible as I only started having doubts until the Gobi desert section of the story where they go multiple days (eight I believe) without water.  What is also dubious other than the incredible endurance required is: why take such a difficult path after leaving Russia?  once your fellow companions are starting to die, wouldn't a more safe path be prudent, especially since you are no longer in Russia.  If you go through such an ordeal, and made such strong friendships, I would think his companions would have at least tried to find one another in the intervening years? or his companions would have talked about there ordeal at least to someone else.
1594489505|5.0|I'd taken \\"A Line Between Friends\\" by Michele Cozzens and \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini to the beach over this past week. I've never had such a delightful and relaxing time all alone. I read and read, and the friendships painted by these two great writers was intoxicating. I can't recommend two more entertaining books. Thanks to both authors.
B000MV9026|1.0|This movie had a few cute bits, but it denigrated many groups of people...if you are interested, even a bit, in information about penguins, see \\"March of the Penguins\\"....oh, and none of them are cholos or members of the rabid religious right.  I watched the video, and was hurt by the racism that I saw.
B000NVIXFK|2.0|Rush's library can be easily categorized. You have the Rockers (Rush, Fly By Night, Carress of Steel, 2112) You have the Prog Years (Farewell to Kings, Hemispheres, Permanent Waves, Moving Pictures). You have the Synth Years (Signals, Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, Hold Your Fire). And finally you have the........uh...ummm...uh???<br /><br />Since 1991's Presto, Rush has hyped each album as a \\"back to basics\\", or \\"return to roots\\" project. This happened no more so than on Snakes and Arrows. But just like last few albums, Rush comes nowhere close to delivering anything resembling their former selves.<br /><br />Even Rush fans are confused. Just look at the polarity of the positive reviews.<br /><br />You have the \\"Rush is evolving\\" crowd that boast how this record is somehow a more complex, progressive work. I find it funny that the word \\"evolving\\" has been used in a lot of fan album reviews since Presto. Is there really that much difference between SNA and the last 4 albums? Is it more \\"evolved\\" because Geddy modulates his voice 10 times over now instead of twice? If so, then all hail Britney Spears: The new Queen of Prog. Other oft used words to explain Rush's love of the dub are \\"textured\\", \\"dynamic\\", and \\"powerful\\".<br /><br />Then you have the \\"Rush is back!!\\" crowd. Wait a minute...I thought they were \\"back\\" when they released Counterparts? Or was it Roll the Bones? Perhaps Rush being \\"back\\" means that they finally ditched the keyboards. Ok, but that was 15 years ago. Unfortunately, the qualities that put Rush on the map in the mid 70's are very hard to find on this album. Alex's renowned intricate and precise playing is still buried under a big wall of studio enhanced noise. He does play a lot of acoustic on this record, which is kind of nice. But buyer beware, there are no guitar anthems on this record. Aspiring guitarists will continue to look up the tablature of Limelight, Freewill, and 2112. Armor and Sword and Bravest Face will most assuredly be skipped. Geddy's wild, roller coaster base lines are strangely hard to pick out of the mix. There are no more adventures to the caves of ice or to our uncle's country place that no one knows about. Instead Neil feels compelled to remind us again that \\"I don't believe in the stars or the planets, or angels watching from above\\" so \\"you can call me Faithless\\".<br /><br />If it is neither \\"evolving\\" nor \\"back to basics\\", then what is SNA? The best description I can think of is a mixed bag of verses and choruses glued together to form songs injected with a studio steroid mix of overdubs and volume. You could cut the chorus out of one song and paste it into another song and not miss a beat on this album. This is most evident in the song \\"Workin' Them Angels\\". Nothing really seems to flow or fit. \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" is another example. You have a basic, blues intro leading into a moronic riff that sounds like it was sampled from Metallica's St Anger, leading into a folksy chorus. \\"Armor and Sword\\" and \\"Spindrift\\" are the overdub contest winners. Alex said he did most of his writing on the acoustic this time. I'd be curious to hear what \\"Armor and Sword\\" sounded like before all layers were added. There actually might be a something memorable there. The last few albums also feature several \\"cringe\\" moments, such as Superconductor, the RTB rap, Cold Fire, and last but not least, Dog Years. This time, in the spirit of Slippery When Wet, Geddy belts out a series of \\"whoahh whoooahhhoh whoaaa's\\" in \\"The Larger Bowl\\". Ugh.<br /><br />If there is any resemblance of their former selves, it can be found in the first single \\"Far Cry\\", \\"The Main Monkey Business\\", and \\"Malignant Narcissism\\". Geddy and Neil finally wake up on these tracks.<br /><br />So I now I understand the polarity of the reviews. As I listened to this record for the first few times, I was trying desperately to find anything that resembled the band I grew up on. When that failed, I tried to just dig the music for what it is. That failed too. So I can't honestly put myself in either camp. I just wish Rush would be more honest in their pre-album hype. I will probably be flamed as one of those \\"Stuck in the 70's\\" fans. But that is ok. Those songs will be around much longer than anything on Snakes and Arrows. It has actually forced me to get my Prog fix elsewhere. I actually discovered Porcupine Tree the other day. So maybe there is something good about Snakes and Arrows after all.hat it is. That failed too. So I can't honestly put myself in either camp. I just wish Rush would be more honest in their pre-album hype. I will probably be flamed as one of those \\"Stuck in the 70's\\" fans. But that is ok.

0440236738|3.0|Coben knows how to write a suspenseful thriller. He proves that in Gone for Good. This book is a page turner, as are Coben's other books I have read; however Gone for Good consists of a plot that has too many complexities, coincidences and presumptions to swallow whole.  Character attributes exist that readers just have to accept rather than question, and the characters are such that I can't imagine their actual existence and behavior as presented by Coben.  This book has many twists and turns as any novel of this length. It keeps you guessing until the very end, so it is a worthwhile read, just not as satisfying as I would have hoped. It also maneuvers through some of the worst kind of characters and behavior our culture/society has to offer...not the kind of stuff that is uplifting, except for an awkward sort of suprise \\"good guy\\" behavior by a otherwise bad character later in the book.

B0002NRRAG|5.0|I first encountered this album a couple of years back, and it was a most pleasant surprise. This is real jazz, the way it ought to be. Madeline, for the most part, \\"covers\\" the work of others; that's OK...old standards became standards for a reason, and she covers them so well that they are virtually her own. This album is my very frequent driving companion. I have since bought her other albums, including the newest release. I wish there were more.<br /><br />  Madeline's personal problems have been well documented. They don't matter here. She is also said to be one of those singers who are better on disc than in person. Apparently, she has severe stage fright. Moot point. So does Carly Simon, and so did Rosa Ponselle, who was the greatest singer who ever lived.<br /><br />  This is a fabulous album. A reviewer once wrote \\"If you like Norah Jones, try this\\". Amen. I love Norah Jones, and listen to her frequently. But, Madeleine is in a different league.

The individual songs need no comment; you already know them. The good news is that she will only improve with time. Our hope is that there's more where this came from. Get this. You'll be glad you did.
B000EULJLU|5.0|This album is their best by far. Previous albums were great, but this one is a cut above. One of my favorite albums from any band of all time. Being a musician, I find the music really interesting, but very well written and melodic. I can't believe anyone could give this a bad review - they just need to listen to it more times. The songs that you don't initially like will grow on you.

B00005JPAO|4.0|Helen Mirren never disappoints.  Even in the bleakest thespian venues (i.e. Shadowboxer) her efforts shine forth.  And, in this film--however much a cliche it is to repeat--she IS the Queen.  Though the role is a natural for the very English actress, her study of Elizabeth II misses not a single beat, from the monarch's ages-old regal bearing to her endearingly quirky styles of pocketbooks and headscarves.    <br />Mirren's character, however, comes across in many ways as a minor one.  The major thrust of the movie is the role (supposedly) played by Tony Blair in the events following Diana's death, and thus he emerges as the principal protagonist.  Michael Sheen's portrait of the prime minister is engaging and well done, but the attempt of the film's creators to put this slant on the action pushes the plot toward a suspiciously leftist turn that taints the storyline.  With his wife as a to-the-max classic foil, the white-knight PM expounds upon his reasons for saving the royals from themselves, and--if one is to believe this movie's premise--does so.    <br />The film's other major flaw regards the renditions of Prince Charles and the Queen Mother.  Though Prince Philip is perfectly cast and portrayed by James Cromwell, the choice of Alex Jennings and Sylvia Syms as the former personages seems odd from the outset, and the scripting and direction under which they wilt has to make the viewer wonder whether sheer ignorance or outright agenda is to blame.  The portrayals appear so unlike the actual strong-willed and rigid-spined individuals that only stark circumstance or referral by name make them recognizable.  Charles is rendered as retiring, wavering, and ineffectual, his visage endlessly pinched by an unripe-persimmon-sucking grimace.  He is said to fear assassination--and better the Queen than he--when, in reality, the man failed to even flinch when shot at in Australia.  While he appears to be the royal who popularized the among-the-people walkabouts and reportedly goaded the Queen into action after Diana's death, these feats are credited to Blair in the movie.  And the Queen Mum, the redoubtable dowager who remained stylish and pump-shod into her 90's, comes off as doughy and shambling and little more than a sounding board for her daughter.  And the character's assertion that the monarchy will be in peril when Charles--purportedly her favorite grandchild--takes the throne?  Only the strange and fictional Charles of this film.    <br />Of course, the feature's creators would undoubtedly admit to a great deal of embellishing and fleshing-out fiction.  It goes too far, though, in the implication that the Queen had not mingled with the common folk since World War II or that the emotional implications of hunting had never crossed her mind.  And, given that the main enjoyment of this feature comes from Mirren's amazingly exacting portrayal, it seems a shame that all the depictions are not as diligently pursued.
0618680004|5.0|It's doesn't matter if you are are a callous atheist, a mild believer, or a religious fundamentalist, you should read this book anyway. It will probably leave you with your own faith and beliefs, but enriched with many stimulating ideas. It will also make a perfect source of discussion subjects to liven up those boring dinner with your friends.  The first part of the book is about refuting the so called \\"proofs\\" of God existence and pointing out the fact that a \\"God Hypothesis\\" is far for being useful to explain the universe , since it creates the biggest problems of explaining God. Not so interesting and new if you have done already a little thinking by yourself but still useful. One really good idea I found in the first part of the book was the the criticism of the \\"automatic respect for religion\\", that is the habit of according respect and tolerance to the weirdest behaviours if only they are a consequence of religious faith. The discussion that I found more interesting are about the morality of human beings and its possible origins and laws, and on the origin the seeminly universal religious sense in our race. The idea of religion as by-product of some other evolutionary useful mechanism like blind obedience to parents, or the ability to understand things through their real or imaginary \\"purpose\\" and \\"intentions\\" is really fascinating. So is the idea of religion as an extention of the psycological process that causes children to create imaginary friends. The chapter on the \\"evils\\" of religion and how , even in its \\"moderate\\" forms can harm the happiness of people is also definitely worth some pondering.<br />Where this book falls a little short is in his analysis of the Bible and the New Testament. First, the real \\"sourcebook\\" for Christianity is the New Testament, it is not calle New for nothing... but this is not Dawkins's fault. In my deep ignorance about history I have alway wondered why Christianity in anglosaxon countries is so centered around the Bible instead of the New Testament, which, if believed is orders of magnitude more important than the Bible. And it seems to have deep consequences on the national characters, if one just looks at the cleverly organized by kinda business cold anglo-saxons compared with the warmth of latin people. Or maybe it's not a consequence but a cause... who knows? The most glaring gap though is a total failure in appreciating the geniality , the poetry and the depth of Jesus life and teachings. Considering the idea of God suffering and dying for the human race as a sadomasochist act is a superficial and silly idea. Even as a little child I noted that Christianity was the only religion I knew of where the founder had not used his cult to life a life of happiness power and domination but suffered and died miserably. That immediately rules out the scenario in which some smart guy uses religious sense in other people to reach wealth and power. It's also an highly poetic and genially crazy idea , the idea of a God suffering and dying like the human race has to suffer and die. I don't know about you, but I would not be able to feel much sympathy for a God that sits comfortably in his Paradise while man has to cope with the harshness of life down here...<br />A subject that needs way more analysis and thinking is morality. It's often repeated that if there is no God to decide what's good and what's evil , than morality is necessarily bound to be subjective and arbitrary. I disagree with this. It would be like saying that without parental guide a kid would not have any idea of what is good  and what is bad. What you see instead is a lot of kids who can do much better than their parents, even when they happen to have terrible parents. The objectivity of morality is rooted not in someone arbitrary decision, be him a parent or a god, but in understanding the objective consequences of an action. It would be quite depressing even for a religious person to believe that, for example, murder is evilnot because of its evil consequences but because God doesn't like it. And that's also why religious people everywhere should have very clear that while reason cannot  prove or disprove religion,  any religious claim or behaviour must stand the test of reason. I would also object to Dawkins optimistic and naive idea of the moral standards improving with time. That's a very narrow point of view that surprises me in an intelligent man like Dawkins..yes, standards of life has improved , sure, in his little corner of the World.. most of Europe and US, but this is just a tiny bit of ur planet. Richard you should have the courage of giving a  hard look at Africa, Asia and south America and realize that the only things that has improved is the economy of a minority of Earth nations, and this partly because of the advancement of science and technology but mostly because of the exploiting of the rest of the planet, like the Iraq war can easily remind us.<br />The only thing that can provoke an improvement in morality is culture and knowledge. In that sense I see the metaphor of God as \\"The Verb\\" particularly striking. Intelligence, knowledge and culture can help us see through the consequences of our actions and give an objective , \\"scientific\\" foundation to make this planet a decent place to live in. Look around, and you will easily see that the persons responsible of selfish, brutal or irresponsible actions are very often persons who have little education and  cultural background. And with culture I don't mean just the one you can get from books and university, but even the family traditions, as in this respect wisdom is more important than sheer knowledge.<br />And finally about the inspiration that the authors tries to give in the final chapters, which should fill the gap left by the refutation of God.. well I have to say that Dawkins is am exceedingly brilliant science writer, extremely stimulating and fascinating as far as science is concerned, but as for inspiration and passion, well he's just a tiny bit to \\"technical\\" for that. And here comes my last critic to this nonetheless fascinating book. Religion can be dangerous, but so can be any kind of fixation, even an adoration for science that makes you look at everything through the same old glasses of science and analyze your life and reality just in those terms. If your life is centered only around one spot, be it religion, literature, science, sportsmanship or whatever else you might like, your life and your view of the cosmos is necessarily going to be narrow , rigid and ultimately boring.<br />ps> and please, Richard, stop it with your meme theory, it's not a scientific theory, it's not needed to explain anything, it's just an analogy.ause of its evil consequences but because God doesn't like it. And that's also why religious people everywhere should have very clear that while reason cannot  prove or disprove religion,  any religious claim or behaviour must stand the test of reason. I would also object to Dawkins optimistic and naive idea of the moral standards improving with time. That's a very narrow point of view that surprises me in an intelligent man like Dawkins..yes, standards of life has improved , sure, in his little corner of the World.. most of Europe and US, but this is just a tiny bit of ur planet. Richard you should have the courage of giving a  hard look at Africa, Asia and south America and realize that the only things that has improved is the economy of a minority of Earth nations, and this partly because of the advancement of science and technology but mostly because of the exploiting of the rest of the planet, like the Iraq war can easily remind us.   The only thing that can provoke an improvement in morality is culture and knowledge. In that sense I see the metaphor of God as \\"The Verb\\" particularly striking. Intelligence, knowledge and culture can help us see through the consequences of our actions and give an objective , \\"scientific\\" foundation to make this planet a decent place to live in. Look around, and you will easily see that the persons responsible of selfish, brutal or irresponsible actions are very often persons who have little education and  cultural background. And with culture I don't mean just the one you can get from books and university, but even the family traditions, as in this respect wisdom is more important than sheer knowledge.  And finally about the inspiration that the authors tries to give in the final chapters, which should fill the gap left by the refutation of God.. well I have to say that Dawkins is am exceedingly brilliant science writer, extremely stimulating and fascinating as far as science is concerned, but as for inspiration and passion, well he's just a tiny bit to \\"technical\\" for that. And here comes my last critic to this nonetheless fascinating book. Religion can be dangerous, but so can be any kind of fixation, even an adoration for science that makes you look at everything through the same old glasses of science and analyze your life and reality just in those terms. If your life is centered only around one spot, be it religion, literature, science, sportsmanship or whatever else you might like, your life and your view of the cosmos is necessarily going to be narrow , rigid and ultimately boring.  ps> and please, Richard, stop it with your meme theory, it's not a scientific theory, it's not needed to explain anything, it's just an analogy.
0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's death made me think about Slaughterhouse-Five, and I read it again for the first time since the early '70s, not long after it was published.  I discovered that it's now a much better book, or maybe I'm now a much better reader...<br /><br />This book is often called an \\"absurdest classic,\\" and it is both of those things.  It relates the life of Billy Pilgrim, who's become \\"unstuck\\" in time, by describing what is happening-- and what has and will happen-- to him simultaneously.  The focal point for all of this is the shattering experience of Billy's life, his presence as a prisoner of war in Dresden when it was destroyed by the allies in World War II.<br /><br />Of course, Vonnegut himself actually experienced the events he creates for Billy, surviving only because the Germans housed their prisoners in concrete slaughterhouses, and it had a similarly shattering effect on him.  He says the book is his attempt to deal with the experience.<br /><br />The book could have been impossibly confusing or just annoying, but it's not.  That's because of Vonnegut's style.  His central thesis-- that the survivors of the horrors of war are sick because they realize that they are \\"...the listless playthings of enormous forces\\"-- is developed with both humor and humanity.  The book is a condemnation of savagery committed as a service to authority; it's also warm and deeply funny.  That might seem like an unlikely or even impossible combination, but Vonnegut pulls it off.  That's why the book is regarded as a classic.<br /><br />This book is easy, quick reading, but it's most certainly not an easy or quick task to forget it.  It's often compared to Joseph Heller's Catch- 22, probably because they are both appreciations-- celebrations, really-- of the absurdity that can be found in the tragedies of life, particularly the tragedy of war.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The movie I enjoyed most in 2006 was Casino Royale . . . and I enjoyed it even more in 2007 on DVD.  Casino Royale stripped James Bond back to the beginning and this movie starts when he earns his double-0 status.  The over-the-top excess was scaled way back and it was an interesting and engaging rebirth of the hero and the franchise.  The violence is not stylized in Casino Royale.  Bond gets bruised, is bloodied and gets hurt.  By stripping away much of the cartoon violence, it is more realistic to see Bond as a hero when he weighs incredible odds yet still attempts heroic feats.  Daniel Craig grew on me as Bond (though there will never be another Sean Connery);  he is rugged, stubborn and still rather raw and unformed as Bond.  Watching the legend begin to take form as Bond grows into the Double 00 role is the secret heart of this film and is intriguing to watch.  The interaction is sharp between Judi Dench's cool M and her newest \\"blunt object\\", who realizes that the life expectancy of a Double 00 agent makes MI-5's great retirement benefits somewhat meaningless.  The first Bond movie I saw was \\"From Russia With Love\\".  By de-emphasizing the gadgetry, focusing on a plot and plot twists, and concentrating on the still-forming character of James Bond, \\"Casino Royale\\" has the feel of that seminal 1963 film.  That's pretty high praise from me!
0316166685|2.0|The writing was exceptional, but some of the characters just were not believable nor does one ever get to really know them.   I found the messages about them confusing, ie: the mother Abigail leaves the family, the children who are left resent her, then a grandchild is named after her?!? What?  Weird stuff.  Where the victim hovers and watches the people she loves was very touching, but when she \\"tumbles toward earth\\" and inhabits the body of a friend....c'mon....  Such a good book then BAM, the author throws in the body switcheroo, among other things...well, it ruined the book for me.     It's a good crime novel, but again, the crime gets no closure.  It seems only to be the story of unrequited teenage love.  Very strange when the crime was so horrendous.  Also, I can see young characters reacting to her murder in the way they did....but not the adults.  The father seemed to be the only stable adult whose grief was real.    It's a good read, just don't expect the end to be the same.  Have to give it a 2.
B00004YA66|5.0|A thriller that associates many interesting elements. First a serial killer, running after him, trying to stop him, in the radical way of today, a good self-defense shot. Then a fireman (yes not very politically correct: firefighter it should have been, but in 1969...) father and heroism, and dying on duty. Then a nurse mother, which is rather banal but explains the overworking schedule of the mother and the over-protective attitude. Then a time warp that happens in a strange way, through an old radio from the time before transistors and computers, with beautiful lamps and diodes.  The orphaned son of the fireman father in 1999 gets in contact through this radio with his father in 1969 or about and they try to stop the killer. After discovering he is a cop. And it works, and the past is changed, and the future of that past is changed, hence the past future is no longer what it could have been or should have been and is what we would have liked it to be. Father, son et grand son. Grandfather, father and son. Three generations instead of two and the orphaned son of the second generation no longer being unable to cope with starting the third generation. Typically American: the desire to change the past, the only thing you cannot change. The future? Maybe if you try hard, and yet without any guarantee. But the past, no way, no hope, and yet there is always an American somewhere who is trying and believing Auschwitz can disappear in thin air. But the most difficult part of the film is the constant shifting from one time to another without being very clear all the time where we stand or are. Except that we get confused after a while.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne

B00006DEFA|5.0|Don't skip this if you're not an opera buff, and don't know much about Mozart. I don't, and am not, and this film did a lot for me. It's the opera buffs and the Mozart experts who get annoyed by what they see as the liberties taken with the facts. Which is understandable, but didn't bother me at all. Nor did I worry about the various accents, which didn't seem to matter in the slightest. What this fascinating and extremely interesting movie vividly conveyed to me was something of the life of 18th century Vienna, as well as the beginnings of an understanding of the divinity in classical music. The sound was uplifting, in a way I never really experienced previously. The script was intelligent, the acting excellent. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was extremely endearing in her role as Mozart's wife, even though it may well not have matched the historical reality. It was obvious that many of the characters were, in a sense, caricatures: eg the Emperor, the Court musicians, even Mozart's father, and of course Tom Hulce himself. This really did not matter, either. Murray Abraham's face spoke volumes, and I thought his performance was superlative in the part, as written. One of the main themes of the story, and I thought it was very well explored and demonstrated, was the essential inequality of man: the simple fact is that all men are NOT created equal. This is a truth which Americans, especially and self-evidently, find difficult to accept. Another theme is the evil nature of bureaucracy, and the inevitably devious politics of the salaried employee. Stay in with the boss, and eliminate rivals --- that's the message. A third theme is man's longing for immortality. Why is it conferred on only a select few? It's also a partial truth that those whom the gods love die young.  This film is a mind-opener, whatever the musical perfectionists may say.
B00005QDZN|5.0|This is an incredible CD together with a beautiful book detailing the rehearsals and performances from the 1970 documentary, \\"ELVIS THAT'S THE WAY IT IS\\".

Plus almost every guy is smoking hot! ;) But seriously if you don't want to buy it, at least give it a try at a video rental place, you will not be disappointed! Beautifully written, directed, and acted out! This is on my top movie list!! What makes it even better is that it is a true story; the men are portrayed so well. I love anything to do with WWII and by far this is the best series/movie about WWII that I have ever seen. AMAZING!
B000J103YI|5.0|Dreamgirls IS the best musical since GREASE... HANDS DOWN!!  great songs and great performances by Jennifer Hudson, Beyonce, Jamie Fox, Anika Noni Rose, and especially Eddie Murphy... that boy did his thang acting and definatley singing. i almost forgot that eddie murphy had a really good singing voice...      of course the showstopper \\"and i am tellin u (im not going)\\" is my favourite song. im only 23 and im familiar with the original version performed by jennifer holiday. i love the original but to me J-Hud Killed it!!!! i perfered her version just because it was heartfelt and she performed it OUTSTANDINGLY in the movie. i cried in the theaters when she performed it... STANDING OVATION!!!!    my other favourite track is \\"i meant you no harm/jimmy's rap\\".  i love the beginning of the song. eddie murphy SANG that song. then it threw me off when he started rappin. that rap was too funny!     all the other songs were great but here are my joints:  \\"move\\"   \\"one night only\\" (original)  \\"one night only\\" (Disco) (my favourite of the 2)  \\"cadillac car\\"  \\"I want you baby\\"  \\"dreamgirls\\"    this does not have all the songs on the movie. you have to purchase the deluxe edition of get \\"heavy\\" 'effie sing my song\\" and more...    this is probably my favourite SDTK i own and i definantly reccomend this SDTK to anyone... and the movie is as good and the songs!!!
B0000047D5|4.0|This 1964 session tends toward the \\"commercial\\" Oscar Peterson.  Ten  tunes, only one clocking in at over 5 minutes (5:11), with Oscar playing with restraint, finesse and polish, backed by his best rhythm section.  The \\"concept\\" was to have the great pianist perform tunes not normally in his repertory but frequently requested by fans. At the same time, none of the last three tunes is familiar, though the closer features full-blown hyper-virtuosic Oscar at full speed.<br /><br />The audio on the 1997 CD reissue is as good as it gets.  Ray Brown's bass retains all of its natural, personal character; Thigpen's drums are crisp and present; Oscar's piano is bright and perfectly mixed--and it's a spacious sound that you would never hear on a Van Gelder recording.<br /><br />If you really want to hear Oscar smokin' on every tune, playing with his \\"serious\\" game face on and from this same period, go to the recordings from the \\"Exclusively for My Friends\\" series, made at the Black Forest estate of Hans Brunner Schwer for his German MPS label (now out on Verve).  Start with \\"The Lost Tapes\\" (Vol. 1) or \\"In a Mellotone\\" (Vol. V), but fasten your seat belt first.  No mellow Oscar on this one--just a volcanic force unleashed.  If that sounds like too much to start with, get your feet wet with \\"We Get Requests.\\"
0743298020|3.0|When I first received the book I started in immediately and \\"couldn't put it down\\".... finally after 2 straight hours of reading I had to. The bad part is, the next day I didn't think about the novel and sort of forgot about it a few days before finishing. The story just didn't stick with me. To me a great read is one you can't stop thinking about and can't wait to get back to. This wasn't. The \\"ghost twin\\" of the biographer was not believable, I couldn't feel any emotion for the character having this great loss over losing her twin. It felt empty. I have to say this book was a let down despite the rave reviews I read.
B00005OCMR|4.0|Like \\"The Black Hole\\" three years before it, 1982's \\"TRON\\" was another Walt Disney sci-fi movie that did not get proper respect upon it's initial release, but has developed an avid cult following ever since. \\"TRON\\" tells the story of a young, hotshot computer programmer named Flynn (Jeff Bridges), who created a handful of popular video games for the company ENCOM but had his ideas stolen by a sneaky co-worker named Dillinger (David Warner), who subsequently rose to the Senior Executive position at the company, while Flynn was subsequently booted out and now makes his living running a video game arcade. With the aid of two friends, Alan (Bruce Boxleitner) and Lora (Cindy Morgan), Flynn breaks into ENCOM and attempts to retreive the evidence of Dillinger's crime, but gets detected by ENCOM's Master Control Program (a highly-advanced computer program with a mind---and voice---of it's own), which catches Flynn and beams him (ala Star Trek) *into* a computer, where computer programs have human feelings & physical bodies (in fact, they are the dopplegangers of the \\"users\\" who wrote them). Flynn is forced to fight for his life as a video game warrior in this vastly colorful, computerized world he finds himself trapped in, as he seeks a way back to his own world....\\"TRON\\" was the very first film to extensively use computer animation for it's visual effects, and it is without question a dazzling feast for the eyes. Writer/director Steven Lisberger and his production team created a fascinating, unique, *alive* world that has never been seen on the screen before or since. \\"TRON\\" also has going for it a brilliant, atmospheric score by Wendy Carlos (available on CD at last!), and terrific performances by Jeff Bridges as Flynn, and David Warner as the oily Dillinger (and his demented program counterpart SARK). Boxleitner, Morgan, Bernard Hughes and Dan Shor also lend good acting support in their roles. However, \\"TRON\\" is not a perfect movie. Lisberger's screenplay could've used some more dramatic weight, and somehow, the movie's finale feels rushed and doesn't quite pack the emotional punch that it should. But these mistakes are forgiveable. \\"TRON\\" is so much fun, that I don't really mind a less-than-perfect script or a rushed ending.\\"TRON\\" was way---and I mean WAY---ahead of it's time, which may explain why the movie went sailing over the heads of some audience members & movie critics back in 1982 (although Siskel & Ebert, in particular, praised \\"TRON\\" to the hilt---thank you, Gene & Roger!). But the passing of time has been very kind to \\"TRON,\\" as the film is now recognised as the landmark, groundbreaking sci-fi film that it is. This DVD edition of \\"TRON,\\" with it's remastered print of the film, the excellent \\"Making Of\\" documentary, deleted scenes and other goodies, is wonderful to have, but I hope the folks at Disney will do the right thing and re-release \\"TRON\\" back into theaters, so everyone can experience this movie the way it was meant to be experienced. In the words of the late Gene Siskel, \\"TRON\\" is a whole lot of fun. It simply dazzles.

0743289684|5.0|So many people are misinformed about Islam. For some reason they believe that it is overwhelmingly a peaceful, progressive and loving religion despite all the evidence otherwise. If I criticize Islam, I am considered \\"racist\\", \\"prejudiced\\", or \\"ignorant\\" regardless of whether the criticism is valid. However, it's kind of difficult to seriously accuse someone like Ali of any of these things, being that she lived in several different Islamic societies and at one point was a devout Muslim. That's why it is so important for her and other Muslim-born women to tell their stories. Ali says that she thinks a woman will be the one to bring Islam out of its dark ages, and judging by the many Muslim-born women to write critically about Islam, I hope that she is right.   <br />  <br />She spent her first twenty years of life in various different countries in Africa and the Middle East; all of them very different societies. The Islamic societies she liven in varied in many ways, but most of them were oppressive to women in some way. As a child in Somalia she endured female excision (\\"circumcision\\") which is the norm- a pre-Muslim tradition that is defended, or at best, not challenged by Muslim clerics. In Saudi Arabia, she describes women being completely covered, and by law not allowed to leave their homes without a man.   <br />  <br />Her experience growing up looks very harsh, especially for a child. She talks about her grandmother's experience giving birth and her comparison of women to a piece of sheep fat. She talks about how she was blamed when her brother played a trick on her, for being \\"stupid enough to fall for it\\". When she is bullied at school, she is called stupid and weak for not fighting back. Women are also blamed and punished for being raped. Family honor is the most important thing in this society, and the family (or clan) decides almost every detail of a person's life. A perfect Muslim woman is called \\"baari\\" and she waits on her husband obediently and stoically no matter what. I've read lots of stories like this but somehow it is still shocking.  <br />  <br />Other topics in this book are politics, including clan rivalry, poverty, and her father being a political activist. They tie in to the story and are the reason she has to move around so much. Her family moves to a mostly non-Muslim country and tries to retain its Muslim identity. Her mother especially looks down on the other religions. She describes her mother as not taking control of her life, instead hoping for Allah to improve it if she is a good enough Muslim (the word Islam literally means \\"submission\\") but when her life stagnates, she brutally takes her frustration out on her daughter, almost killing her. She also writes about how Jews and America are blamed for things such as a malfunctioning car, when most people don't even know what Jews and Americans are.  <br />  <br />As a young woman, Ali learns everything that she can about Islam. During this time there is a religious revival where Muslim youths want to go back to the laws and times of Mohammed. Ali becomes deeply involved in Islam, despite some unanswered questions that go on in the back of her head. She depicts her cultural confusion well, as she wears a veil and tries to avoid contact with men, meanwhilewhile she also enjoys risque romance novels and gets into some makeout sessions. She writes that the strictness of fundamentalist Islam makes people susceptible to hypocrisy. This is what I've noticed too among my more devout Muslim friends who would talk about the sin of premarital sex, homosexuality, etc, and then go on to ask me detailed sex questions or find an excuse to grope me.  <br />  <br />Her pivotal moment comes when her father gleefully sets her up with someone she doesn't want to marry, and doesn't take no for an answer. Her plane stops in Germany, and instead of going on to Canada to marry this guy, she escapes to Holland and eventually becomes a citizen.  <br />  <br />She is amazed with every detail of Europe, even just things like having street signs, and it's amazing to read about it. As she becomes a student, she learns about things like psychology, political science, and history. She realizes that her childhood contained a lot of abuse and trauma- something she didn't realize before. So many things never occurred to her because her mind was molded a certain way all of her life. It's fascinating to see her eyes open up.  <br />  <br />She also writes about other Muslim immigrants in Holland; in her experience, most of them look down on Holland's \\"infidel\\" society, don't try to assimilate, and blame most of their problems on racism. A lot of people take the accusations seriously, and in my opinion this jades people so that they don't pay attention when there are genuine cases of racism. She tells the truth where most people avoid it because they are so afraid of being called a racist.  <br />  <br />The biggest turning point of all is after 9/11. She notices how quickly people scramble to defend Islam, saying it isn't the beliefs that caused it, it's America and the West's treatment of Arab countries, it's Israel and Palestine, etc. The word \\"Islamophobia\\" is used for anyone who has any reservations about Islam. I notice this all the time; in every article about a terrorist plot, there is a disclaimer about how it has nothing to do with the majority of Islam. Basically, she says yes it is the beliefs. (Really. Many peoples are oppressed but they don't all pick up bombs.) She encounters well-intentioned people who know very little about Islam but insist that it is \\"the religion of peace\\", and the Dutch government that allows Muslim immigrants to stay cut off from the rest of Holland, going to Muslim schools, getting excised, and basically learning the same backward things they would have learned in a Muslim country, because the government doesn't want to be culturally imperialistic. She is furious when she writes these things and I was thinking \\"finally someone is writing how I feel!\\"   <br />  <br />One of the most important things she writes is about the myth that extremist Islam is not true Islam (and true Islam is about peace and love, etc). She, as someone who has read the Quran, and learned and lived Islam, states that the extremist Islam we know is basically Islam in its true form. She mentions a quote in the Quran, something to the effect of \\"the rules are in plain view, reinterpreting them is blasphemy\\" and talks about her father having some religious interpretations and making up things that are not in the Quran at all. Her father is supposedly a nonviolent, liberal Muslim, but he still advises her to be sexually available to the husband at all times and says things like \\"instead of asking permission to leave the house all the time, just get his permission permanently.\\" So Ali shows that a)nonviolent Islam is not the true Islam, and b) even nonviolent Islam is pretty sexist. (I still haven't seen all these peaceful, rational Muslims that everyone's talking about, and I've seen that a lot of them put on an act as well.) Whether a more modern Islam would be \\"true\\" Islam or not, she still seeks to reform it for women's rights.  <br />  <br />In Holland she gets involved in government to try and improve the lives of Islamic women. She gets a lot of opposition, but it looks like she did a lot to open their eyes and reform Dutch immigration. Although she shows her anger, she is not hateful; she is motivated by concern to improve women's lives.  <br />  <br />I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially people who embrace Islam without knowing much about it. For me it was preaching to the choir, but I learned more about Islam and have more examples to cite the next time someone wants to debate with me. It is an in-depth book, but I was hooked on it. She has quite a story and has accomplished a lot after coming from a traumatic background. Unlike most people, she has the balls to tell thetruth about Islam. Finally!
B000E41MRC|5.0|WOW!!! The power of film. Very Scary!!!! It reminds you to be critical of the \\"information\\" the media provides.
B000002AGN|5.0|This album changed the rules in jazz in two important ways.  First, it introduced atypical time signatures to jazz performers.  Performers were pushing ever other musical limit, including harmony (Miles Davis, Bill Evans, . . .), melody (John Coletrane, Eric Dolphy, . . .) and song structure in general (Ornette Coleman, Cecil Taylor, . . .).  4/4 and 3/4 time signatures were already optional in contemporary classical music and some ethic music.  Brubeck opened up this fertile opportunity for the jazz world (and later rock like Led Zeppelin, Jethro Tull and Rush).  Perhaps more remarkable was the fact that this album proved that the public was receptive to this new approach to popular music.  Brubeck went pioneering and returned with no lethal arrows in him.<br /><br />The best part about this album is that this new technique was not just a novelty; it was a path to creating timeless compositions like Take Five and Blue Turk a la Rondo.  My favorite things about Brubeck are his range of expression (from cool and understated to highly muscular), and the unique voice of Paul Desmond's saxophone.  Desmond's instrument has the bird-like sweetness of Charlie Parker combined with the lazer-focused tone of John Coletrane.  The alternating solo voices really injects life and breath into the group.<br /><br />The use of different time signatures did not did not get embraced as widely as one might expect in a genre built on creativity.  Some felt that odd time signatures did not \\"swing\\" (although Brubeck and others disproved that), some may not have felt comfortable with or inspired by this new approach, and I suspect that the distinctiveness of this contribution by a white man made it \\"uncool\\" among many jazz musicians to do something that sounded \\"like Brubeck\\".  The happy side effect for Brubeck is that this album stands out in jazz like few other works.
B000NVIXFK|3.0|Rush, I LOVE YOU GUYS.    I know you well ... but this is Counterparts all over again... gag ...    Peter C. Jones \\"drumboy\\" hit it right on the head in his review ...    Specifically point #3 and Ged's vocals ...    For the love of GOD, get a producer who can take Geddy's genius and turn it in the right direction.    If I were king, I would have rush focus on writing tunes that have a solid *popular appeal* (I know, heretic) and are *timeless* ... this really is THE ULTIMATE CHALLENGE ... a classic that appeals to ALL and is not soaked in cheddar.    Songs like Working Man, Fly By Night, Lakeside Park, 2112 Overture, Closer To The Heart, The Trees, Spirit Of Radio, Limelight, Subdivisions, Between The Wheels, Middletown Dreams (my stretch), Mission, The Pass, Bravado, [this space left blank for counterparts], Driven, Earthshine, Sweet Miracle (God Bless you Neil) ...  anyone in their right mind would love these tunes!    Because times have changed and new talent has arrived, Rush are not as \\"technical\\" as they once were ... they should simplify like Aerosmith did and write great popular songs. Other bands like Dream Theater and SymphonyX make Natural Science sound like patty cake. IMHO, sad but true.    Rush, share your life experiences in song ... not through time changes and layered vocals. We are still listening...    Garbo
0743454537|5.0|When two-year-old Kate Fitzgerald was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia, her parents decided to try saving their daughter with a genetically compatible sibling. Thus Anna is born, first helping her sister minutes after birth with the rich contents of her umbilical cord.    But the cord is merely the first donation of many, each becoming increasingly more invasive. Brian and Sara Fitzgerald tell themselves that Anna, like the rest of their family, wants to do anything feasible to help Kate live. But how can a child really do anything other than what her parents tell her?    At 13, Anna stuns her family with a lawsuit, declaring her need to be medically emancipated so she won't be forced to donate a kidney to her sister. But Kate is in end-stage renal failure, with weeks to live. As it is, doctors are divided in their recommendations of allowing her to undergo a surgery that she is most likely not strong enough to survive. So why should Anna undergo unnecessary risks herself, if her sister will most likely not even get to benefit?    Nonetheless, the Fitzgerald parents are adamant. Anna's kidney is the only chance 16-year-old Kate has left.     Like any adolescent, Anna's emotions are all over the map; added to a complex moral issue that leaves adults baffled, and it's no surprise that Anna questions her decision to pursue legal action every day.     The story frequently rotates viewpoints, showing insight from everyone involved: Anna, Sara, Brian, neglected oldest brother Jesse, attorney Campbell Alexander, guardian ad litem Julia Romano. The one person whose voice is conspicuously absent, however, is the one person whose life is at stake. The only means for readers to know anything at all about Kate is through the eyes of others. And in a situation like this, it's crucial to know where she stands. How does she feel about the threat of impending death? Of potential harm to her beloved younger sister, who is essentially her only friend?    The truth is, no one inKate's life has any idea what she wants, only what they THINK is best for her. Thus the conclusion of this complex and troubling case is ultimately a shock to everyone involved...
0679731725|5.0|Midway through a pivotal scene in \\"The Remains of the Day,\\" Lord Darlington's young godson confronts the butler, James Stevens, about the nefarious goings-on in Darlington Hall, insisting angrily, \\"you're not curious. You just let all this go on before you and you never think to look at it for what it is.\\"  A gentleman's gentleman to the core, Mr. Stevens serves at the pleasure, and defers to the judgment, of his lord, and this training limits his robotic, repeated replies: \\"I don't fully understand what it is you're referring to\\" or \\"I'm afraid I have not noticed any such development.\\"<br /><br />\\"Remains\\" is basically a British comedy of manners--and there are many episodes that are certainly, if wryly, humorous. Yet Stevens is the anti-Jeeves--a man whose worth in his profession is inversely proportional to the value of his opinions. This point is brought home when one of Darlington's guests, to prove his arguments against England's \\"present parliamentary system,\\" mockingly asks the butler his stance on several economic and political issues of the day. \\"I'm sorry, sir, but I am unable to assist in this matter.\\" Whether Stevens has knowledge on these matters is beside the point; he's accepted that it's not his place to offer his own views. He is a man with style, but without substance.<br /><br />As a result, Stevens proves to be the most unreliable narrator, and it quickly becomes apparent that his defense of his employer's integrity is actually defensiveness. Stevens's lack of \\"curiosity\\" and his impassiveness result in the book's three most disquieting subplots: he admires greatly his father (also a butler), but they remain aloof from each other, with heartbreaking consequences; he furtively reads romantic novels, but refuses to entertain the unsubtle overtures from the housekeeper Miss Kenton; he disagrees with his employer's reasons for firing two maids yet refuses to challenge him. For her part, Miss Kenton turns out to be the real hero of the book, trying during her tenure to break through Stevens's emotional barriers and haunting his thoughts long after she's left the household.<br /><br />Yet, if Ishiguro's novel were simply another upstairs-downstairs tale, it wouldn't be much to recommend. Instead, Stevens is any of us who wanders blindly through life, doing no more than what's expected and leaving \\"the great affairs of today's world\\" to others. Indeed, \\"Remains of the Day\\" offers a frontal assault on conservative, oligarchic notions of morality. (The endless discussions over the qualities of a good butler and Stevens's arguments for \\"his lordship's good judgement\\" seem at times a parody of Edmund Burke's defense of monarchy.)<br /><br />It's not a coincidence that both Americans in the novel, while behaving like tactless cads, are ultimately being proved right for favoring honesty over \\"honour.\\" One of the Americans, Stevens's new employer, encourages the butler to drop the stiff upper lip and engage in some friendly banter, offering Stevens a belated opportunity to rejuvenate his own sense of worth. In spite of the novel's focus on aristocracy and servants, its moments like this one that underscore the truly egalitarian nature of Ishiguro's work.e to break through Stevens's emotional barriers and haunting his thoughts long after she's left the household.

B0000252YK|4.0|I am not a huge Ozzy fan but want to make things straightened out.  Allmusic.com, which people refer to often, grades this awesome album below mediocre. The critque seems to target the general hair rock of mid 80's. This album has everything to constitute a great hevey metal music, except for solid chemistry between Ozzy and Jake.     In fact, Ozzy's voice does not impress me as usual but the guitar blows my mind. Here in the Ultimate Sin, Jake E. Lee explodes his anger in his playing, the most agressive and heaviest guitar among Ozzy's albums. Jake deserves better than what people said about this album.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|Rush have been trying to write this album since Counterparts and they've finally suceeded. There's not a wasted note and it's thematically and sonically cohesive, huge sounding and hugely emotional. What struck me right off the bat was how well the lyrics, vocals and music mesh, how tight and integrated the band sounds and how powerful. Snakes & Arrows sound is some serious ear candy. Alex's acoustic stringed instruments blend perfectly with his rich distorted guitar, Geddy's monstrous bass and heartfelt vocals and Neils drums to make one hell of a diverse sonic treat. I don't think Neils drums have ever sounded better, they're just whipcrack smart and like I said Geddy's bass and Alex's guitar are powerful and well recorded/mixed. Rush brought the rock with this one baby. Snakes & Arrows is about guitars; it's a riff monster of a cd. What little keyboard there is is used for atmospheric effect. There are also three instrumentals, one of which is a beautiful acoustic piece appropriately title Hope. The other two aren't flashy a la La Villa Strangiato or YYZ, instead they're dark and grooving. But for me the most striking thing is Neil's lyrics and Geddy Lee's vocal delivery. The lyrics are very dark actually and certainly the death of Neil's wife and daughter have much to do with the very personal and somewhat introspective content. But it's not quite as personal as Vapor Trails, the focus is more towards society and religion and it's juncture with the individual. There's a maturity of outlook towards life in general that I find extremely moving, oftimes resigned but not entirely hopeless. Neil makes some hard observations about the times we're living in, the modern world and what it means to be human. Geddy's vocals perfectly emote the lyrics and though he can't hit the high notes like he once did, he makes up for it with feeling. It's taken me about two weeks to properly digest this album and I feel that with Snakes and Arrows Rush have created one of their most emotional offerings in years and one of their hardest rocking of their entire career. For me it's their best work since Signals. In fact because of this cd and to a lesser extent the R30 dvd I've bought tickets to see Rush which will be the first time I've seen them since the eighties. I am jazzed about this album in a way I haven't been about Rush since Permanent Waves.motional offerings in years and one of their hardest rocking of their entire career.

B00007LTIB|5.0|Out of the ten YES albums I own, I do believe this one (Remastered and Expanded with 3 extra tracks) is my absolute favorite. Although it is hard to choose with other greats - \\"Close to the Edge\\" - \\"Fragile\\" - \\"The Yes Album\\" - I even find the s/t debut to be very enjoyable...<br />Yes, I am a true fan of 'Relayer' as I tend to play this one most often. This was my first album in the vast and extensive YES catalog. -Very intense and satisfying to my ears. More of a straight forward - in-your-face progressive Rock sound (especially with \\"Sound Chaser\\")then the one before it - the more atmospheric \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" which is still a joyous and stimulating, but relaxing mind trip, none the less.<br />'Relayer's' opener is \\"The Gates of Delerium\\"(Epic 21 + min.) - Highly enjoy it's sound with it's intense \\"battle scene\\" of instruments : drums & keyboards. The Electric guitar bliss of course tapering off into a meloncholic section with Jon Anderson singing : \\"Soon...\\"<br />\\"Sound Chaser\\" (track 2)just sounds like all instruments sounding off in a fast pacing glorious mess of noise and scope. Yes, this is my favorite YES track by far, and it's really where new band member Patrick Moraz (who leaves after this studio album)shows his gifted technique Rocking out the keyboards.<br />An Amazon friend of mine (who suggested that I check this band out) was a bit surprised that I picked 'Relayer' up first out of YES' catalog.<br />He said \\"Relayer is like a Rubick's Cube of sound (confusion), but Chris I am really glad you enjoy it.\\" -Then he pointed me to checking out 'Fragile' and 'Close to the Edge' & believe me I am really thankful because of it.<br />\\"To Be Over\\" closes out the original 1974 album. It's a bit more of a dreamy style song with a gentler beauty then the chaotic pulse racing (\\"Sound Chaser\\") but this really is more of a reflective piece closer to the sound of \\"Tales From Topographic Oceans\\" - built with structure.<br />- Then you have the expanded three songs including \\"Soon\\" which is the part where I feel Jon Anderson really delivers one of his best vocals.<br />The part taken out of the opener -\\"Gates..\\" but you get right to this section of wondrous beauty : \\"Our Heart is open Our reason to be Healed\\"<br />- My favorite expansion track is the last version of \\"Gates of Delerium\\"-<br />More fully charged sound enlightening the mind and shows off more of YES' creativity.<br />I always like extra songs from Remastered + Expanded albums. It's just more to love and 'Relayer' does not disappoint.<br />'REPLAY the RELAYER' CHA CHA CHA cha cha!!which is the part where I feel Jon Anderson really delivers one of his best vocals.  The part taken out of the opener -\\"Gates..\\" but you get right to this section of wondrous beauty : \\"Our Heart is open Our reason to be Healed\\"  - My favorite expansion track is the last version of \\"Gates of Delerium\\"-  More fully charged sound enlightening the mind and shows off more of YES' creativity.   I always like extra songs from Remastered + Expanded albums. It's just more to love and 'Relayer' does not disappoint.  'REPLAY the RELAYER' CHA CHA CHA cha cha!!

It's very original. Even if you aren't a Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, you should at least give this album a listening to. If you do, i think you would be pleasantly surprised. It was worth every penny.

1401307450|5.0|\\" Scar Tissue\\" is undoubtedly one of the most unusual books I have ever read. The story itself is very interesting. Lead singer of RHCP Anthony Kiedis tells his audience about his childhood, going from michigan to being with his very laid back father in California. As the story progresses, he reveals trouble he runs into with girls, drugs and with establishing a truly original band way before its time. Although most of the story seemed a little repetitive and the ending was somewhat disappointing, I thought the book was great. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good read.
B0000214F1|3.0|Probably, people are primarily interested in this movie because of its reputation as expensive porn, in which case the old R rated version is passe.  However, honestly, it's the better version.  Take away the endless, lengthy gratuitous explicit porn and violence, and you can see this is actually a pretty good movie with some good acting.  I liked this movie when I saw it years ago, and out of curiosity just rented the uncut version.  After awhile, I just got bored.  Do you want a Penthouse spread or a decent movie?  The decision is clear if you know what you want.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Theres gonna be a lot of people out there who are going to criticize the hell out of Wolfmother for being too 70's and 60's retro rock, but if thats the kind of music you like and listen too especially Black Sabbath or Led Zeppelin like me, then you are going to love Wolfmother like i did, i probably wouldn't have bought this album if i hadn't heard 'Woman' first and wanted to know what the other songs were like and immediately got hooked. This is a MUST HAVE for any classic rock enthusiast. The lead singer has amazing vocals and he can turn simple guitar licks into legendary riffs and his two other band mates which include the drummer, who has a superb sense of rhythm and can tear up the drums along with the bassist who is an accomplished synthesizer player as well. Like i said, its a MUST HAVE for any Led-Head or early Sabbath fan, go ahead and buy it and be pleasantly surprised.
1594489505|3.0|I met the Khaled Hosseini and his lovely wife at an Author's Salon over three years ago when he had just launched his first book THE KITE RUNNER.  I loved that book!  He announced that he was working on his second novel, about two women, and I could not wait to read it.  A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS is, unfortunately, not as fascinating and exciting as THE KITE RUNNER.  It still is a good read, but stops short of becoming the captivating and mesmerizing novel that THE KITE RUNNER is.

I didn't expect the movie to be as bad as it was. This is one of he worst adaptations of a story to film I have ever seen. The acting was poor and the story was terrible. The only entertainment I got was my son laughing at how bad the movie is and he is 8 years old. He liked the book and noticed every difference from the book and the movie. Needless to say neither I nor my son liked this movie. Avoid it at all costs.

This cd has a lot of great music on it. If you liked Scenes of a Memory, Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence, Train of Thought, or Octavarium, then you will like this cd. If you are stuck on Images and Words, which was LAME, then you probably won't like it as much. Systematic Chaos is really cool! You won't regret picking this one up for your collection!
1594489505|5.0|I just finished this great work with yet another lump in my throat. (This novel rivals The Kite Runner.)    I am a mystery, suspense junkie and very seldom interested in exploring a new genre.  The Kite Runner and now this well written second novel by Khaled Hosseini spoke to me.  Spiritually, it made me aware of my surroundings; how well off I am, while at the same time taught me about strength and perseverance.  At times, I must confess, these are attributes I feel I am lacking.  The perils confronting Mariam and Laila are considered typical for Afghan women upon departure of the Soviets in 1989.  What we may consider the horrors of residing in a war torn city was simply common day experiences for the two heroines of this great work.  Throw in the fact that women are treated less that third rate citizens and you have the makings for what courage is truely all about.    Book of the year and bravo to Khaled.  The only downfall to finishing this novel is now I have to attempt to find something to replace it.

B00000IGGA|5.0|I believe that I own every Tom Waits release.  I even saw him play once, way back in the day.  Seems that it was early 80's in New Orleans and there was this skinny mop-head playing a funky organ and grindin' out tunes with a voice like Satchmo without the joy.  I bought a crappy homemade cassette tape from him and burned that thing up.  Never thought about the guy again for years.  Then a buddy tossed Bone Machine my way and the magic renewed.  Like I'd found an old friend who had been lost.  My children have grown up listening to TW and they are the better for it.  My daughter has danced to his music and my son rips off some of his melodies on his guitar.<br /><br />Mule Variations is, to me, the most memorable of all TW's releases.  \\"Get Behind The Mule\\" tells it like it is \\"Big Jack Earl was 8'1---He stood in the road and he cried---He couldn't make her love him---Couldn't make her stay--But tell the good Lord that he tried\\" (we've all been there).<br /><br />\\"Picture in a Frame\\" can raise tears from any man who has ever loved (or is in love) \\"I'm gonna love you---Till the wheels come off---Oh yea---I love you baby and I always will---I love you baby and I always will---I love you baby and I always will---Ever since I put your picture---In a frame\\" ('nuff said!).<br /><br /> Best line ever comes from \\"Come on Up To The House \\"come down off the cross we could use the wood\\" (I've ripped that line off every time I encounter a self martyr).<br /><br />The lyrics and melody to \\"House Where Nobody Lives\\" could make a grizzled trucker cry.  The picture he paints of that house that's \\"abandoned and cold\\" is a grim reminder to us all that life's treasures ain't \\"shiny or gold\\" but rather \\"What makes a house grand--Ain't the---roof or the doors---If there's love in a house---It's a palace for sure\\".<br />We all should take a page from that song and make a daily devotion to putting love in our own house as it is then a palace for sure.<br />Thanks Tom.
0596527055|5.0|When I heard Scott Berkun was writing another book I knew I'd want to take a look at it.  When I heard the new book was about innovation I knew I absolutely had to read it.  Scott is a brilliant guy, and having graduated from Carnegie Mellon University and worked at Microsoft in the '90's, he's certainly got the credentials to back up a book on innovation.<br /><br />His new book, The Myths of Innovation, more than lived up to my expectations.  Before I get into the details, I first want to note how quick and easy a read this one was.  The approximately 150 pages of core content could probably be handled on a 3-4 hour flight...if I wasn't such a slow reader.  Then again, this is one of those books that makes you stop and ask yourself questions as you read it; don't rush through this book without thinking through those questions that will undoubtedly come up in your mind (e.g., how does this apply to me?, what have I been assuming about this?, how can I use this to innovate better in my own role?, etc.)<br /><br />How many times have you gathered a team and said \\"let's brainstorm a bit and figure out the solution to our problem\\"?  Most would probably agree that creativity doesn't happen at a designated time or location, but Scott's book helps dispel other popular myths as well (e.g., does innovation happen via epiphany?, is the so-called \\"expert in the field\\" more likely to come up with a great idea?, etc.)<br /><br />Here are a few of my favorite excerpts from this great book:<br /><br />\\"Big thoughts are fun to romanticize, but it's many small insights coming together that bring big ideas into the world.\\"<br /><br />\\"If we struggle to imagine past innovators doing amazing things in our workplaces, what makes us think we can do creative work in them?\\"<br /><br />\\"But for most of us, even in one of these special moments, we fall back to the comfortable illusion that we already know everything there is to know.  We forget that the common sense we hold dear today was, years or centuries ago, discovered by an innovative mind willing to ignore the common sense of his own time.\\"<br /><br />Finally, if you want to see Scott's sense of humor in action, be sure to read the book's colophon.  I know...who reads the colophon, right?  I usually skip past it too, but this one's a hoot!ive mind willing to ignore the common sense of his own time.\\"    Finally, if you want to see Scott's sense of humor in action, be sure to read the book's colophon.

0446614459|5.0|David Baldacci was born in 1960. He attended law school at the University of Virginia, and went on to work as a trial lawyer, and later as a corporate lawyer, in Washington, D.C. He is now a full-time writer whose best selling novels include Absolute Power, Total Control, The Winner, The Simple Truth and Saving Faith. He lives in Virginia with his wife and two children.    The author has come up with a new thriller that is reminiscent of his best selling debut book, Absolute Power. It has all of the thrills and excitement of a first rate novel.    Sean King is going place in the closed world of the Secret Service, that is until he makes a fatal mistake. It only took a split second, but that is all it took for a man to die, a man who was under the protection of agent King. Third party presidential candidate Clyde Ritter was dead and Sean King's attention had wandered at the vital moment. He retired from the Service in disgrace and now eight long years later he balances careers as a lawyer and part-time deputy sheriff in a small Virginia town.    Then he hears some news. Another third part candidate has been taken out of the presidential race, abducted right under the nose of Secret Service agent Michelle Maxwell. King thinks its time to take another look at the truth of the matter and forms an uneasy alliance with Michelle Maxwell. But the truth is never quite what it seems and even one unguarded moment can be fatal. The book is full of twists and turns and is well worth reading.
B000FVGN00|5.0|A Sonic Masterpiece. Period. Probably the most exciting album ever made- by Marc Bolan or anybody for that matter. This is the most intense hook-filled plethora of Pop/Rock and Roll/Glam nonsensical, wonderful music and lyrics ever! All I can picture is 'Through the Looking Glass' or 'Alice in Wonderland'(maybe his mad hatter's style hat) driven by the best Les Paul riff-driven 4th generation Rock and Roll you can imagine! This music is as stirring as The Beatles or The Kinks in their prime.<br />Buy it before you go any longer without.....perhaps try some other T.Rex such as 'Electric Warrior' (another gem)first and get geared up!!
1594489505|5.0|Given our countries status with the muslim world, I have begun to take a great interest in learning about the lives of the people who Bush so ardently hates. In reading books on Iran, Afganistan, Seirra Leon, etc. I have come to realize that the devastation left by war is miserable. This book does a spectacular job of bringing the human side of civil and global war to it's reader. I encourage everyone to read this moving novel. It speaks to so many parts of our life through love, friendship, parenthood, and conflict. It's painstaking detail to the souls in Kabul, Afganistan from 1970's though 2000's is brilliant. This may be the best book I've read all year. Mr. Khaled, I'm ready an hungry for number 3.

B000N0WCLC|4.0|The movie was good.  Buy it, rent it, rip it, whatever you want to do - just watch the movie.      From what I understand, ALL the Warner Bros high def transfers are mastered for HD-DVD first and then ported to Blu-Ray, making the technology argument completely moot.  It's mastered in HD-DVD format first because it's easier and more economical for the studio to do so.  What have we learned today?  To date (as far as I know), all WB high def titles are mastered for HD-DVD, even if it's on Blu-Ray.     I still think Leo DiCaprio should have been Oscar nominated and won for his role in The Departed.  But he did well in Blood Diamond, too. If you are fortunate enough to have both HD-DVD and BR, spread the love and pick up The Departed in HD-DVD, since it'll look identical to the BR version ;-O      It really is a shame that one has to go to the standard def DVD page to find out if people liked the movie, rather than have a typing war on why one format is superior than the other.  If the studios really were as smart as they think they are, they'd release the same titles on both formats, allowing the people to decide who wins.  Plus, they'd make potloads of money by having their cake and eating it, too.      Just my two cents.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|I really cannot appreciate how this film is being portrayed by movie critics as a drama about human miscommunications. In my opinion, it is about human stupidity, period.     For example,     1) After September 11, it is stupid to take vacation in Muslim country, where the locals may be hostile. Like it or not, US heavy-handed tactics in punishing the terrorists did create a lot of enemies in the Muslim world.      2) It is stupid for an illegal aliens working in the United States to cross the border. I cannot imagine how the nanny can return to the States without any identification.     3) It is stupid to let her nephew Santiago drive since he is apparently intoxicated.     But the movie did remind us one thing: i.e. in this post 911 world, if an institution/administration/government/individual is being labeled by the U.S. government as terrorists (with or without evidence), you are going to be in big trouble.     Three stars for this timely reminder.        3) It is stupid to let her nehphew Santigao drive since he is apparently intoxicated.
B00004XPPB|5.0|This is an all around outstanding film.  The script is great, the acting is great.  The scenery and costumes all feel very real.  It's a violent subject (and not one I normally like for a movie) but the film makes you feel for the characters, especially Donnie Brasco/Joe Pistone.  And, even though he's the bad guy and I know he got what he deserved, I couldn't help but feel something for Lefty Guns, too.      The film interested me so much that I bought both the book that it was based on and Joe Pistone's follow up book, \\"Unfinished Business.\\"  I highly recommend both of them.  Joe Pistone is a true American hero.
B000P0J02E|5.0|Zimmer has outdone himself yet again. This is one of his most beautiful scores.<br /><br />It's particularly impressive that he did not do what most composers of third-movies-in-a-trilogy do (even though it has good reason): rest primarily on already-established themes. Sure, he keys in the themes from 1 & 2 where appropriate, with delightful variations, but this score is mostly original work. So many stirring themes, all of a piece for these movies.<br /><br />Listening to the score on its own, one can better appreciate its dramatic support of the film -- particularly in how he built much of it off the song penned by screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio (and co-scored by director Gore Verbinski) that's so integral to the story.<br /><br />The orchestrations, particularly in \\"At Wit's End,\\" \\"Up Is Down\\" and \\"One Day,\\" are wonderful. I could listen to the stirring \\"One Day\\" for days on end. The Morricone tribute \\"Parlay\\" is great fun, enhancing the spaghetti western visual inspiration in the film.<br /><br />One small regret: there is a beautiful new theme played briefly in the film's climax (and perhaps elsewhere) that does not appear on the soundtrack, which is odd since there's certainly room on the disc.<br /><br />A score worth owning. It's stunning.
B000NHG7BG|3.0|5 stars for better picture quality. Very clean picture quality. Great sound mix.  3 stars for the new cut. Prefer the original cut.  2 stars since the deleted scences are already in the original cut  1 star... No new features. Missing commentary.
0151013047|4.0|Hamid has a remarkable gift. His writing is concise, gripping, and intriguing. The Reluctant Fundamentalist is an impressive work unto itself due to Hamid's narrowly confining himself to a very limited structure. I have read several books that try so hard to be clever in their construction and all but a few of them fall flatly. This book however still manages to sing and hits every note that Hamid aims for with a solid strike.<br /><br />The constraints placed on this novel are almost insurmountable. First of all, and most notable, is that Hamid chooses to tell this story as a one sided conversation in the first person. Every word here is spoken aloud from the protagonists point of view. The other side of the conversation is only referred to in response. Secondly, the entire story unfolds at a 'real time' pace. From dusk to early evening over a few drinks and a dinner, a life's history unfolds. These two major blocks that Hamid has chosen to set in his way from the outset do not hinder this story in the least. Instead, the unusual style manages to bring the reader into a place that is as unfamiliar as I think Hamid would like for us to feel about being in Pakistan.<br /><br />One novella kept coming to mind as I read this story. It was 'Mezzanine' by Baker, a story that unfolds as a person takes a trip up an escalator to a mezzanine. Clever, well done, but not on par with this novel. Also, I kept thinking of all the undergrad English majors who aspire to write a book exactly this well conceived.<br /><br />Where the Reluctant Fundamentalist falls a little, is not with Hamid's superior writing, but instead with his limited reach plot wise. I felt that his love story was a little on the simple side and I came not to care very much about it. I was looking over and over again to see if Hamid might be using the love story as a greater metaphor, like that his love was the USA rejecting him while not even seeing him. This book is all metaphore in a way, and can be disected to ones contentment on many levels. The only serious problem with the metaphore angle is that if you want something concrete or obvious, you wont find much to nail down that is very satisfying.  I was underwhelmed towards the end in the manner that Hamid chose to wrap everything up. The final pages are great, they leave you in the dark and hanging on a 'what just happened?' Soprano's style thread.<br /><br />I look forwards to many more Hamid books down the road.n many levels.

B000OCXMAE|4.0|Yes, I like Linkin Park. I always enjoyed the heavy hooks and overproduced sound. I am not young by any means and am a Metal/ Rock fan from way back so i jump no bandwagons and review this strictly on what it is.<br /><br />This CD is a change, but not as drastic as some may think. The band is attempting to not be stuck with 1 formula. The hooks are there but dont kill you like in the past. The recording is excellent and the performances are credible.<br /><br />As for effects and samples? Severely cut-back. Scratches and rapping? Minimal.. But i love the live vibe of the more upbeat tracks like \\"Given Up\\", \\"No More Sorrow\\" and \\"Bleed it out\\". Its really different and i commend them for that. They could have stuck to the samples and looping, but stay true to their instruments for the most part. Vocally, its stronger than previous recordings, dare i say maturing?.<br /><br />Aside from upbeat numbers there are obvious hits all over the place. They still know how to make radio friendly music. But of course there are the syrupy overdosed tracks as well. Especially 'Shadow of the Day' which sounds like it should have been sung on American Idol. And 'Hands Held High' which just ..... sucks! yeah.. Some of the tracks and messages are a bit much, even i must admit that.<br /><br />The trick to this disc is to respect its more laid back style instead of hitting you over the head with its heaviness it creeps in after a few listens. Though i am a fan of the older/ heavier stuff like 'Faint' and 'Points of Authority' i can appreciate the style change. No band should become a parody of themselves.<br /><br />I wont break every song down, theres 400+ reviews that can do that but i would best describe this cd as an attempt at long term credability, and it works for the most part.. I would dare to say they are attempting a more 'Incubus' approach in style than a 'Limp Bizkit' approach. Lyrically it is decent enough for its Genre, and some tracks are rather deep. Lets just hope they dont take themselves too seriously.<br /><br />Seeing they will sell 5 million of these regardless, i would say it COULD have been better after such a long hiatus. But 6 or 7 tracks are keepers.Seeing they will sell 5 million of these regardless, i would say it COULD have been better after such a long hiatus. But 6 or 7 tracks are keepers.
0783228007|3.0|1972's \\"Joe Kidd\\" pairs Clint Eastwood, then a young acting phenomenon, with veteran director of Western movies John Sturgis.  The result is a serviceable action movie that never quite lives up to its potential.<br /><br />Former bounty hunter-turned-rancher Joe Kidd (played by Eastwood) winds up in the middle of a turn-of-the century New Mexico range war when dispossesed Mexican peasants rebel against a judicial system that favors the Anglo land owners.  Frank Harlan (played by Robert Duval) tries to hire Kidd to track down the leader of the Mexicans, one Louis Chama (played by a hugely mustachioed John Saxon).  Kidd initially refuses, but changes his mind when the rebels raid his own small ranch.<br /><br />Kidd rides out with Harlan's group of hired guns, an interesting collection in their own right, highlighted by actor Don Stroud with an early version of the automatic pistol.  The group suspects Kidd's sympathies from the beginning, and when they take hostages against Chama's surrender, Kidd is also confined.  Kidd's escape from the village with Chama's girlfriend provides a deliberately paced but worthwhile action sequence.<br /><br />Kidd links up with Chama's band, only to reveal his real and very bold agenda, to take Chama in to face justice for assaulting Kidd's ranch.  Chama, in a rather unrealistic standoff, agrees to go in with Kidd, and as the two men and a few followers race Harlan's gang back to the courthouse, they form a grudging respect for each other.  In a second and final extended action sequence, Kidd and Chama will fight their way back into town against Harlan's collection of hired guns.<br /><br />Eastwood is in his essential mode, tough, competent, and laconic.  However, the storyline repeatedly develops the bends trying to keep Joe Kidd on the right side of the political conflict.  Wise viewers will ignore the plot contrivances and focus on some well-done action sequences and the sun-drenched New Mexico landscapes.  This is an enjoyable Eastwood movie.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Sicko, is an informative documentary on today's American Health care crisis. This documentary is just a glimpse on how corrupt the medical insurance companies are, and how they value profit more than saving lives. A few horror stories included in the documentary are of a woman whose infant daughter died after being denied antibiotics because she wasn't at an \\"in-network\\" Kaiser Permanente hospital. Also, an uninsured man who sliced the tips off two of his fingers with a table saw and was able to afford to have the tip of his ring finger reattached for $12,000 but could not afford the $60,000 for his middle finger.  911 rescue workers, ill from their efforts at Ground Zero, who were denied adequate care by their respective providers.<br />After viewing this documentary, it will leave you asking questions as to why it is so expensive to receive medical care in the USA? Why can't the USA follow in the footsteps of London, France, and Canada by providing health care at little to nothing out of pocket?<br />As an American citizen in my 30's, it makes me pessimistic just thinking about what my future will bring if something major ever happens to me medically. Am I going to have to work until I die just to pay for medical bills? The American government needs to stop wasting billions of dollars trying to police other countries, and begin providing a health care system that every one can feel confident in.<br />Is that to much to ask for?
B000NA2776|3.0|I like this album.  It's fun, catchy, easy to listen to.  Some of the songs are really great.  I feel compelled to write, however, because I think there is a lot of \\"filler\\" on this album.  That's bizarre to say about a debut, but I honestly feel that his style of impersonation falls flat on pretty much all the slower, more intimate songs.  Those songs aren't bad in most cases, but they just are not very memorable for me.  The other drawback is that some songs that seem cool and quirky on first listen, become a bit annoying on repeat listenings (Lollipop, Love Today).    I think the songs where his influences are worn on his sleeve are his best offerings.  I wonder what his own musical voice is and whether that would be worth listening to.  Will he have any staying power after the novelty of his Freddie Mercury and Jake Shears impressions wear off?  That isn't a drawback to this album more of a speculation for the future.    I cannot reasonably give it higher than 3 stars; this album is too much of a mixed bag, despite being pretty fun.  So far all the reviews are either 1 star or 4 or 5, and for such an inconsistent album, I don't think either of the extremes is appropriate.  I'll be interested to see what his next album brings.

1594489505|5.0|As impressed as I was with Kite Runner, I was more impressed with this book. The author is a splendid writer, creating scenes that can be imagined with such imagery.  The characters become real---I felt they were my friends, and their saga was something I thought about even when I was not reading the book. The women are such strong, bright characters with so much potential, but they become a product of their times and wars. There was much sadness in all of the characters, even in Rasheed...a bright man but a product of a disastrous and defeating self image. Miriam broguth tears to my eyes with her sense of humanity and love.   I hope the author is working on his next book!!!
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby's attempt at humor throughout the book remains an area for improvement, but the great tips he reveals throughout the chapters are worth their weight in gold. Covering diverse topics such as shooting people, weddings, the city, landscapes, flowers, and a few others, you'll learn a number of dirty secrets which the pros use consistently in their daily routine. Even after a quick read, I found myself looking differently at photographs in magazines, and when I take my own. It's an easy read, and it's well worth your time!
B000F48CD8|1.0|Most under talented, overrated performer/entertainer in pop in the last 30 years. Terrible album. Indulgent, completely forgettable regurgitations of the things one learns when they first pick up an instrument. I don't think the whole amateur rock think is cute at all... Terrrrrrible...
1582701709|2.0|The premise of the book is both empowering and powerful: you are what you think. After discovering this 'secret' Rhonda Byrne goes on a quest to find and bring to us other great minds which used this idea to their advantage. However, in the midst of the intertwined analysis of laws of attraction, positive thinking, and metaphysics, she undermines her own work by taking 'the secret' to a logical extreme - at times, her examples are irrational and meaningless. Miraculous events happen whether you believe in them or not, it's a game of probability, and it is one thing to underestimate this, and a completely another to blindly believe in something you want to be true.  If you're looking for a motivational book, there are better ones out there - take a look at Jack Canfield's 'The success principles.'
B000PFU7OO|5.0|If you're into dumb neat Hollywood prepackaged cliches vacuous and lifeless with no soul because you've got the brainpower less than a gnat, this movie is not for you. If you like moving, real feeling, movies crafted with love with people who are as real as people you'd meet every day that moves you, this movie is for you. The soundtrack isn't just a companion to this wonderful movie, in a sense it is the movie, both beautiful and heartbreaking. In a rare feat of 40 years this is the first time both my favorite album is a soundtrack to a movie, but my favorite movie is a soundtrack to an album.
1565114159|5.0|The Innovator's Dilemma by Clayton M. Christensen is a must read book for any person interested in keeping their business moving forward or for any person starting a business.

B000ION79Y|1.0|I have nothing to add to the other one-star reviews of this bad movie, except perhaps to emphasize the incomplete and inadequate ending, but I found it interesting that, if you watch the credits to the end, you get some idea of the kind of help a wealthy man gets when making a movie. For in the credits (which seem to include most of the population of Bucharest), you can learn the names of (1) \\"Mr. Seagal's Stunt Double\\", (2) \\"Mr. Seagal's Photo Double\\", (3) the provider of the \\"Wardrobe for Mr. Seagal\\", (4) \\"Mr. Seagal's Make-Up Artist\\", (5) the \\"Executive Assistant to Mr. Seagal\\", and (6) the \\"Driver of Mr. Seagal's Trailer\\".  Further, you can even learn the provider of \\"Mr. Seagal's Trailer\\" (Translux International Ltd.).    The mystery is that, among all the members of Mr. Seagal's entourage, we are not told who is \\"Mr. Seagal's Voice\\". At least I didn't see that.    A bit more work along these lines and Mr. Seagal may discover how to make a film with no personal presence at all.
1594489505|5.0|I love the Kite Runner because of its twist and turn and also because of the narrative style.  Since I become aware of this book, I was hesitant because many times sequels are not as good as the first one *looking at all the sequels coming out this year in theaters*.    However, A Thousand Splendid Suns has done it well.  It was a little slow at first, but then things started picking up once Mariam remained in her father house.  Things start to change.  And sometimes I guess you have to be responsible for the choices you make.      In A Thousand Splendid Suns, you will see how the life of two different women who grow up in two different era intertwined with each other and how  the relationship affected their future, for better or worse.  You will see how much they have struggle, and I am sure, not just women in the story, but a lot of women in the world might have suffered the same experiences but they went unnoticed.      The story brought tears to my eyes many times throughout the night.  And yet, sometimes you just want to put it down to recompose yourself over what you have just read, you couldn't help but continue on.     It made you look like you have invaded somebody's life, somebody's privacy, somebody's guilt, and pain, and yet, you will continue to read it until you really understand, that they need to be understood, and they need to be told so that their story will never be forgotten.
0767836324|5.0|My 5 years old son love to watch this movie. He also watch Disney Peter Pan(anime) but after few months I bought Hook and peter pan(no anime) then he liked it very much because he know the story from Peter Pan animation so it is easy to understand.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I will write a proper review on this in time, but for now I want to know why the standard US release does not include the songs \\"Running Joke\\" and the title track. Both are fantastic tracks, and the title track is possibly my favourite on the album. The songs appear as 'bonus' on my UK version. I do not understand this as they are more than worthy of being on the original list.
630521610X|4.0|A great thriller, though extremely cheesy.  I'm not a very conservative person, but I was surprised by the amount of swear words.  As usual, the special \\"collector's edition\\" extras are nothing special.
0143037757|1.0|Unfortunately this book is marred by the author's insistence of  incorporating strongly held views which often hinge on out-dated Cold  War prejudices. This, in combination with the over-emotional tone of the  book raises a question of trustworthiness. For instance, the  author's antipathy for Russia goes as far as to excuse the Baltic  countries' embrace of the Nazis during WWII on the basis of their  occupation by the USSR. Unsurprisingly, he is demonizing Putin for his  efforts to serve the interests of his own country rather than those of  other nations. To this end, Judt employs the implausible media  exaggerations about the state of Russian democracy/human rights which  are common in the countries in charge of Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, the  torture flights etc. One wonders if it is hatred of Russia that is really  behind Judt's denunciations of Communism.    The book does mention the Russians' disappointment at the lack of  sympathy for their suffering during the last century, but the list of  misfortunes includes only those that coincide with Western  pre-occupations: gulags, poverty during Communism etc. These are  certainly  experiences that have deeply traumatized the Russian people and Russians  resent that they are often portrayed as the perpetrators rather  than the victims (the main ones!) of a criminal system. However, in  addition to that, what the average Russians find unjust is the lack  of sympathy and awareness for the profound way the Nazi attack affected  them (20,000,000 dead, the atrocious war crimes, the beginning  of the implementation of a Nazi vision for a slave race consisting of  Russians and other Slavs etc.). They also resent the lack of  sympathy for the predatory way in which other countries attempted to take  advantage of Russia after the collapse of USSR without any  concern for the wretchedness to which this condemned the people of  Russia. There is no mention of all that in the book.    This book simply reflects the average sentiments, misconceptions and  ethnic favouritism of the media. This is perhaps legitimate but  what I expected from a well-known historian was to resolve some of the  inconsistencies present in the stream of news we receive and a  better supporting argumentation. The book has not been successful at  that.
B00005JPD0|1.0|This 'Time-Machine' gets into the hands of the US government.  They make one that is about a 100 times larger, consisting therefore, of 100 times more bolts, screws and monitor screens. (surely the US government will be able to afford that)      Then, (here comes the exciting part) President Bush come up with the brightest idea he has ever come up with in his presidential carreer.  He sends groups of well-trained specialists (bringing high tech technology with them) that will prevent all the evil that has ever infected the history of humanity.  So, one group to prevent 911, one group to prevent WorldWar2, another to prevent WorldWar1, another to prevent poverty, and so on...  Now the great thing is, it doesn't matter if these specialist groups die while on their mission in the past because they will be alive in the future anyways. (Like denzel washington, who still was alive in the end of the movie)    Ultimately, the result is a dreamworld.  A world with no terrorism, war or anything evil in large scale.  Paradise.      Everyone lives happily ever after.  The end of the Movie.    But wait a second, is time travel really possible?  You never know what humans will be able to do in the future...    Switch on CNN or any international news program and you will find out that DejaVu 2 might be a silly daydream.  Today, there is more terror and evil than ever.  Nobody has ever come from the future to help us eliminate all this terror for us.    If time travel was possible, our world would have been eliminated of evil by now...    -I suppose I should comment on the movie, as that is what reviews are for.  If we are open-minded enough to ignore the silly story, I think the movie itself was really bad. (I might sound like someone who has no clue and gives 1star ratings for a reasonable movie, whilst most others have been giving 5stars)   But, it's one of those kind of movies where a lot of money is invested (even if the story is ridiculous), add a bunch of (stupid)car crashes, sound effects, explosions and all that, to try to make it look spectacular, just to pick up the cash after.     If I knew what a waste of money this film is, I would prefer to just walk over to the movie producer and hand him the cash directly to him, without watching the movie.  Atleast it would have spared 1 and a half hours of my life.
B000NVIXFK|1.0|To say that Rush blew it on this one would be the understatement of the year. I remember my brother (Also a Rush fan) told me that the highlights were on Rush's website, and it was one chord! I thought to myself...uh oh. And I was right. The whole album is basically one chord, with a few tidbits added to the disc so you don't press eject and throw this into the next hemisphere. I got my copy for $21.12 and couldn't wait to here Alex Caress of the steel guitar, but hold your fire there Rush fan, There are no signals on this album at all, just a bunch of monotonous permanent waves.   Also, as a counterpart, it's not written that well either. Neil wrote in an interview that he was writing with Alex and Geddy over the phone, well hold your fire! Maybe this is all due to a bad phone connection! They should try a test for echo on that phone line. And a message to all Rush fans. It's not always good just because it's Rush. At least they should have the grace under pressure to apologize for this.

B000OZ2H02|3.0|1. ITPOE Pt 1 - Very cool     2. Forsaken has a nice Piano -keys intro and a good groove till the 2:00 muinute something.     3. Constant Motion n- Intro - very ELP. Listen to the Tarkus intro then listen to this again. Got it?? Vocals sounds more like Dreamtallica. Vocals and snare et al sounds Dreamtallica. Fantastic groove overall.     4. Dark Eternal Light - Sounds more like a more sophisticated version of Primus. Kick and snare are not 2-1,2-1 as Primus but 3-1-6-1-6 or something like that but it sure sounds POrk Soda- Oink Oink sing along after two bars and say     \\"My name is Mud...... chances are you'll be on the beat dead on.     5. Prophets of war - If you missed Cher's last gig at a discotheque, look no further. I could expect talent lacking acts with a heap of mediocrity to do this electronic thing i.e. Frooty Loopy. Fortunately Rudess closed Frooty Loops at the 1:12 minute timestamp, just when it was beginning to sound like Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh or Madonna. This could well be some DJ's food till the 1:12 minute from intro and then again later. Funny though, but it sound's like Petshop Boys \\"Go West\\" soon after with more color added in from Rudess' space sound keys. Sing along and say \\"Go West ......from the 1:35 minute mark to 2:26.I'm sure Weird AL would love to get his hands on a redo of the lyrics. Repeat and sing \\"Go west ... when ever you get a chance...... (even wear those funny tapering party hats like in the Petshop Boys video if you have to).     6. Ministry of Lost souls sounds good but the mellow bit goes to Repentance with a Yes touch. In its entirety the song has sketchy patches from other older albums like SFAM and thats not good. It just goes to show you that their creativity is getting saturated in much the same way as Dylan's depressing lyrics.    7. ITPOE Pt II - This I think, is just where DT put all the hard work for the year at Avatar. 16:38 minutes of sheer brilliance from beginning to end. A kind of \\"hey\\" thing looping at the 6th minute and the stink of Dreamtallica again. Then there's that smell of ELP Tarkus/Trilogy, Keith Emerson at the keys at the 9:23 minute and 10:23 minute keyboard parts and hence sounds like Hoedown. Does Emerson know that some of his ideas are mish mashed in Jordan's riffs? JOrdan's original lead in scales at the later part of this epic is indeed enthralling and awe inspiring. Makes my fingers itch for practice. The lyrics sound quite relevant to the US occupation of Iraq.   Talking of feel in DT- there is none after Kevin Moore left the band, to pursue 'feel' in Turkey's Okul release.     Overall a cool album and I am not totally disappponited. A lot of demons and dark masters on this one unlike previous albums of more palatable surreal lyrics and DT's becoming gothic Epic with SC. Who knows their next album could have castles, ogres and vampires and I'm outta here.  If you mute your ears from listening to all those silly demons and like stuff that this album talks about in some songs, you would appreciate the virtuostic content better.I would appreciate it a lot if the band had worked out longer to produce an album,in say two years, of quality creativity rather than within a year. Thats because when I hear the same patches of older DT masterpieces in the new material, the words \\"WILL MAKE MUSIC FOR FOOD\\" starts to register in my mind. I think it would go well to advise all of you to buy the Cds off the shelf rather than download so DT can live \\"ANOTHER DAY\\".
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I Love this CD :) My favorite song is track 11 'Born for this,' I also enjoyed track 6 'Let the Flames begin' it kinda had a Pat Benatar sound and track 10 'Fences' had a Stray Cats/Fishbone/Ska sound. Oh, Track 4 'Misery Business' is good, too!  Kuddos for Paramore and their producer David Bendeth who also produced 'Breaking Benjamin,' 'Red Jumpsuit Apparatus,' 'Hawthore Heights,' 'The Almost,' and many other awesome groups.

0393327345|5.0|Since a relatively young age I'd been calling Fight Club one of my favorite movies, and at varying intervals, my absolute favorite. During the latter years, I loved it for it's great story and neat action. As I got older, some of the comedy started to make more sense, and then when I really started to grow up, the philosophical statements littering the film became powerful for me.  So, eventually a friend who loved the film equally picked up the book, and after finishing it as quickly as he did he let me know I had to read it. I wasn't the biggest reader at the time, a little here, a litte there, but was trying to read a decent amount. Then, I read that. And that changed, big time.  To be put simply; this is quite possibly my favorite novel. There is nothing about it, that is not brilliant, that will not keep you turning the pages and will stop you from putting it down. It's hilariously funny, terribly dark, a bit moving, and completely insightful.  For anyone whom has enjoyed the film, you will be nothing but pleased. It also happens to be a very easy read; and while you can get alot of the same ideals from reading Nietzsche Chuck has some of the absolute best ways of putting it, and best for those not quite up for philosophy.  The philosophical tones are so powerful, yet so simple that it's enjoyable for anyone - and can be especially enjoyable for the angsty teenagers.  It's also a decent amount different from the film. Tyler in the film is far more the embodiement of the Nietzschen Ubermench - but the attitude remains, and resounds, a bit more poetically too. The narrator's insight isn't only at the given intervals it is during the film, but is throughout, and Marla is done even more grossly hilarious than she is in the film. Both are exceptional pieces, and I will admit I would be torn if I were forced to pick one or the other, but I think my choice my well rest in the novel.  If you're not a reader, this is the kind've book that will make you want to be. There's little not to love. It's funny, dark, satrical, and all the while powerful.  An unforgetable novel, and a must read for anyone; no matter your disposition.
1594489505|5.0|I loved \\"Kite Runner\\" so much that I yearned for another novel from Hosseini.  However, when you wait so long for something, it never seems to live up to the anticipation.  This book is the contradiction.  I just finished \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" and I wish I could read it again all over.  I absolutely loved the way he intertwined the women's lives.  His characters came alive in every emotion I felt as I read the book.  You will not be disappointed!
B0000TLA9G|3.0|I love GNR. They remain one of my favorite bands. They put so much feeling into their music and lyrics (even those that are about drugs and sex). This was the first GNR CD I bought, and at the time I was in love with them. Years later I was pushed by a friend to buy Appetite for Destruction. I said to him, \\"I already have their greatest hits.\\" But he replies, \\"No you don't. Not really.\\" So eventually I bought AFD, and I was blown away. It is one of the greatest albums ever written. It's absolutly astounding. I am shocked to see that this greatest hits collection only had three songs from AFD. I no longer listen to this collection. Songs like Nightrain, Mr. Brownstone, My Michelle, and Rocket Queen weren't included. They certainly are better than some of the Medicore songs on here like Yesterday, Since I don't have you, and Such Fun. How were they hits, they were cover songs that did little to elevate the bands success. Where's It's So Easy, Coma, Estranged, and Garden of Eden. (even their underrated songs just mentioned are better than some songs on this track). If you want GNR's best, buy Appetite for Destruction and Use your Illusion I & II. If you want one CD then just get AFD.
0060922583|1.0|I have an open mind.  I am open to a great many ideas, and embrace the evolving paradigm of our reality. With regret I feel compelled to relay that a moment taken to investigate the authors bibliography will shoot holes straight through this book.  It is unfortunate, because it is this type of writing that allows strict scientific types to discredit theories that challenge the established ways of thinking.     The premise is great. Unfortunately, the tangent of estranged supposed proofs does more harm than good.
0446528056|5.0|I loved this book from start to finish.  What makes it so compelling is that from the start, the reader pretty much knows how it will end - well almost!  Even so, I was propelled along, hoping for a different outcome or an unexpected twist.  We got that twist, and although it wasn't particularly comfortable, it was totally in keeping with Sparks' understanding of what real love is.<br /><br />I respect Sparks for using contemporary themes and not hitting us over the head with his political agenda.  That's not always easy to do for a writer.  He presents the war from the character's perspective as part of the story and allows the reader to draw his or her own conclusions.<br /><br />I would love a sequel to this book - perhaps one with a happier ending for the characters.  Maybe someday!
0618154248|3.0|These stories are great.  We love Curious George. However, the board books in the box set have thinner and flimsier cardboard pages than the singly-sold board books.  They bend easily in my toddler boy's hands (who isn't gentle with books), so I'm saving them for later when he's older.
0316010669|2.0|A book obviously intended to entertain as opposed to educate.  While the premise is interesting, the science does not support the jumps that Gladwell makes.  Read Damasio, Baars, or even Dennett to get a better idea of recent brain science from people actually in the field.
B00000633N|5.0|This is absolutely the Pet Shop Boys at their finest.  If you're thinking of getting this disc, I second the motion!  You will not be disappointed.  While there are only 6 tracks on the disc, they are longer than typical length and excellent pieces of musical art.  Highlights are \\"Left To My Own Devices\\" and \\"I'm Not Scared\\".  Have a listen!
0743496728|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but there are some flaws that Jodie Picoult can't seem to stay away from with every book.    Why does the character who is 'bad' (in this case Matt) have to be a sterotypical 'baddie'? Isn't it enough that he tormented Peter for 11 years, but he had to be abusive as well? Overkill.    I also think this book would have done well without the 'twist' at the end, that Jodie is so well known for. It was well written and while the ending was always going to end one way, the twist ruined the end of the book for me. It seems Jodie can't finish a book decently, so she throws the twist in.    Otherwise, I enjoyed the book thoroughly and found it well written.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|The title \\"Lullabies to Paralyze\\" has kind of an ominous ring to it, a sort of sweet and evil combination of words that comes off as foreboding. Open the CD booklet and you'll see Josh Homme's mysterious, bizarre and, yes, evil lyrics lurking within. Also present are sinisterly drawn animals inhabiting a dark forest. Despite all this bleakness, QOTSA's fourth album is loaded with accessible, high-energy rockers that don't drift much from the band's past stellar work. Sure, Homme's echoed vocals and the slowed-down interlude on \\"Someone's in the Wolf\\" contain a foreboding vibe; but these elements of the song are surrounded by a lively riff, crisp-as-a-razor drums and an overall familiar sound that's expected from this band. Similarly, the dark and driving riff on \\"The Blood is Love\\" conjures fond memories of some of the more mesmerizing and drawn-out fare from the great [[ASIN:B00004TH6O Queens of the Stone Age - Rated R]] album (2000).<br /><br />The CD begins placid enough, just a gentle acoustic guitar and Mark Lanegan's rugged, deep croon. Like an explosion, though, the short-but-sweet \\"Medication\\" kicks in with a vengeance. Its pile-driving riff reminds me of the song \\"Regular John\\" from QOTSA's mighty debut, [[ASIN:B00000AGA0 Queens of the Stone Age]] (1998). However, it's not all just polished guitar riffs and scorching licks. \\"Lullabies\\" contains gems like \\"I Never Came,\\" a laid-back ditty with soft vocals by Homme, funky percussion and great guitar work. \\"You Got a Killer Scene There, Man\\" shows the soulful, bluesy side of Homme and his ever-changing band, while \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\" takes the CD out in a tuneful, sentimental and somewhat unexpected way.<br /><br />Fans of QOTSA's past work won't likely be disappointed in this CD. In fact, the head-bobbing riffs splattered all over the album are pretty much as solid as anything this band has ever released, and that's saying a lot. The pleasingly heavy sounds and lyrics heard on \\"Tangled Up in Plaid,\\" \\"In My Head\\" and \\"Little Sister\\" stand up well with the tunes from any past QOTSA CD. And to be sure, Homme is one of the most unique rock and roll artists to come along in a while. Interestingly, his constantly changing band lineup might actually keep QOTSA fresh-sounding and relevant, rather than stagnated.e Sister\\" stand up well with the tunes from any past QOTSA CD.

B000P2A256|5.0|It's been 6 years too long since Songs About Jane was released, it's about darn time that they produced another fantastic album, it's been far too long and we're having withdrawal symptom from Maroon 5's music, to the point that I was feeling that their old songs were overplayed on the airwaves!    In this latest album, tracks like Makes Me Wonder, Nothing Last Forever and Won't Go Home Without You show lyrical imagination and some of the lyrics used are very real, talks about everyday life, sometimes funny, and it makes you feel good about yourself. I can predict that Nothing Last Forever will be their next single, or at least one of their singles along the line in the future. Makes Me Wonder is their current single, which hit the charts right at the top. Not Falling Apart has a U2 flavor in it with the strumming of the bass guitar in the background and the rock rhythms. Back At Your Door has a jazzy blues feel to the music, very sexy feeling in this song, not to the point of being sleazy.    It's been a long wait and a long time coming, and they say good things come to those who wait. But this album is definitely worth the wait, even if I had to wait a much longer time for it, I'm glad I waited for it. It's everything you ever wanted, hip, chic, trendy and has a nice 80s beat to it underlying some of the tracks, which gives it the distinctive feel of excellent music.    I foresee another Grammy Award coming their way!
B000003C2S|5.0|I first heard the 'A side' of this album off an old tape that this guy in the army that I hung out with listened to. I immediately like it. The music is good and the lyrics grim but sometimes funny. After listening to this album a few times I realized that there is a social message in each song, at least that's what it seems like to me.

B000002GB2|4.0|I'm 14, and I got into Styx almost completely by chance.  My parent have no record players or LP's, and neither have any Styx cassettes or CD's.  My Dad and I were just listening to SIRIUS classic rock, and Lorelei came on.  I IMMEDIATELY LOVED THE SONG!  That night, I also happened to watch \\"Big Daddy\\", and learned that the song Mr. Roboto was by Styx.  Since then, I've been collecting their albums.    In fact, this is the first of theirs I bought (because of Lorelei), and I was not dissapointed.  The very first song I heard told me that I was going to enjoy this band for years to come.  Well, one year later, I'm still into this album.  Compared to their others, it's not their best, but it's still essential to have for Lorelei and Light Up alone.  Light Up:  Ought to be in their Greatest Hits I.  Very mellow, 60's feel.  9/10  Lorelei:  Styx's first step towards stardom, and one of the their best songs to date.  10/10  Mother Dear:  Strange, upbeat feel.  It's actually very entertaining.  8/10  Lonely Child:  Very nice, passionate love song.  DeYoung's vocals are top notch here.  9/10  Midnight Ride:  Probably the most forgettable JY rocker.  Still O.K. though.  7/10  Born For Adventure:A DeYoung rocker.  It's a very heavy sound, which doesn't quite match DeYoung's vocals.  6/10  Prelude 12/Suite Madame Blue:  Just barely worse than Lorelei.  Another classic Styx prog/mainstream hit.  10/10

B000002C2E|5.0|Time Out Of Mind is a masterpiece of atmospheric mood music and evocative imagery, expressed in moody blues numbers and melodious ballads. This mix of blues and ballad is reminiscent of the style of many Tom Waits albums. Although I prefer the folky ballads, the album forms a cohesive musical statement with an impact that lingers long after the last notes have died down.<br /><br />The bluesy tracks include Love Sick, the almost talking blues Million Miles and Can't Wait, and Till I Fell In Love With You which in its undulating rhythms is midway towards being a ballad. The instrumental mix and arrangements on all of these are raw and gripping and will have great appeal to those who love blues music.<br /><br />Despite its title, the uptempo Dirt Road Blues is a fast lilting ballad with a catchy tune. The tone changes for the next song, the melancholy and soulful Standing In The Doorway with its stirring organ and absorbing imagery. I suspect this one will eventually take its place as one of the most memorable songs in his oeuvre. Likewise, the beautiful Tryin' To Get To Heaven has elements of autobiography and haunting poetic phrases that stick in the mind.<br /><br />There is something darkly prophetic about the shimmering Not Dark Yet, a song of ominous foreboding and weary resignation with sublime poetic lyrics, whilst Cold Irons Bound with its driving beat is closer to a rock song. Not surprisingly, Make You Feel My Love is a straightforward and tender love song, and the album concludes with Highlands, a mid tempo rumination with understated jangling guitar.<br /><br />Working with Lanois previously produced the 1989 masterpiece [[ASIN:B00026WU3M Oh Mercy]] and this one is another winning combination. The mood is mostly somber and reflective, perfectly captured by the production which lends added gravitas to the sentiments expressed. Time Out Of Mind is definitely amongst Dylan's top ten works, a truly timeless masterpiece.
0757302661|4.0|I read most of the book.  Tried to get into a class but it was full.  I thought the best part about the book was the philosophy.  Truly our beliefs and expectations flavor our experiences, I have known this before, but it was nice to have this book to encourage me to continue using this knowledge to help me through my birth.  However, the excercises seemed to be nothing more than relaxation techniques that I have already learned.  Although I'm pretty sure that I would have benefited more from the book if I had practiced them anyways.  The extra material not related to hypnobirthing in the book was kind of boring because I have read it elsewhere in numerous books.  As for the birth, I certainly haven't mastered the mind control that this technique requires yet, but to the extent that I have I benifited.  Now that I know what I need next time I know I will do even better.
B00004WG2F|4.0|This movie is an epic tale told of three brothers and one woman in Montana in the first part of the twentieth century. The youngest brother comes home from college with a beautiful woman on his side. She falls for the middle brother Brad Pitt, who is not altogether interested. The oldest brother falls hopelessly in love with her. This movies plot does get convoluted and confusing at times. The tortured soul that is the middle brother is a model for narcissistic ego maniac. It does have beautiful cinematography, and the story and the characters are interesting enough to keep your attention. The problem I have with the movie is that it does just get too bogged down with its own story. Overall it is fun to watch and I recommend it.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|\\"Miss Potter\\" is that rare movie which manages to be sentimental and heartfelt without being cheesy or melodramatic. It has sad moments balanced by a happy ending and GORGEOUS panoramic views of the English countryside. Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor are adorable together, and perfect for their roles. It is a movie quite appropriate for anyone, of any age-- although it features a beloved children's book author, it is an adult movie-- but one in which \\"[...]\\" is the only word approaching profanity, and in which the single kiss that occurs is sweet and almost asexual. \\"Miss Potter\\" is clearly a romance, but it is also about a woman struggling to make a name for herself in Victorian Britain, at a time when the only acceptable role for a married woman was to BE a married woman, and when there was not much of a place for a respectable UNmarried woman in society.<br />All in all, a delightful movie, and one which I highly recommend.
0307346609|4.0|This book was extremely well written, very professional, very engaging. It is not a novel. It does not tell a story, per se. It is an account of a zombie apocalypse told through various snippets of stories, journals and reports from a variety of different people of numerous cultures, nations and backgrounds.     There is no protagonist or any constant characters, but many different characters, each with his or her own view point concerning his or her own little piece of the catastrophy. All the little snippets and characters are very well done and hold the readers attention. Often I found myself wanting to know more of a certain persons story. When a writer leaves you wanting more, it must be a good book.    I would have prefered an honest to goodness novel, a cohesive story thus my four stars instead of five. I certainly recommend this book to any zombie enthusiast. It is well worth reading.

B000F3T3CS|5.0|Yes the acting of Rolando was out there but in opera if you are to see the smallest nuances you need to act big .TV and DVD home in on these parts which do look hammed up close but from the back of the theatre I am sure they are just right.I truely loved this opera it was so much a bright up beat production.There is little enough in opera repetoire for the singers to have fun and this is one where the lighter side and sillier side has its day.The addition of the live donkey reminded me of a programme with Birgit Nielsen doing the Ring cycle  and lustily singing for her horse ,the look on her face when the stage hands brought in a real horse was worth its wieght in gold.(needless to say she didn't stop until the horse returned that was it she gave up !!)So who cares if caterpillar eyes are over the top I personnaly found this whole production to be a brilliant piece of musical entertainment with a wonderful cast and some really funny moments

B000059T1E|5.0|This is Traffic's third album, but Dave Mason has left to pursue a solo career, and it is mainly Steve Winwood, with help from Capaldi on drums, and Chris Wood on Sax, Flute, and Organ. A core trio, and in the studio they create a full sound, with just these three key players. It embraces a variety of styles, even for this eclectic group, ranging from the old English folk ballad, \\"John Barleycorn,\\" to the jazzy R&B of \\"Glad.\\"<br /><br />\\"There were three men came out of the West,<br />Their fortunes for to try,<br />And these three men made a solemn vow:<br />John Barleycorn must die.\\"<br /><br />There are many versions of this folk ballad, some going back as far as 1465, and collected by Cecil Sharp from 1900 to 1910. There are between 100 and 140 versions, and in the one used by Traffic & Co., in spite of the solemn efforts of the three men to triumph over John Barleycorn, or distilled liquor, this was the outcome:<br /><br />\\"And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl,<br />And he's brandy in the glass;<br />And little Sir John and the nut-brown bowl,<br />Proved the strongest man at last.\\"<br /><br />Steve Winwood plays guitar on this, and Chris Wood plays flute. There are two vocalists, and I am guessing that it is Capaldi and Winwood. Not much percussion, and hard to sing when you're playing flute. There is a tambourine. Winwood seems to be deeply into this music, and the treatment sounds both ancient and modern.<br /><br />\\"Glad\\" is an instrumental, and there is an extended jam, mostly piano and keyboards. Great drums, and a fat sax riff that is easy to play, but it sounds so cool, and ends on a very cool sounding trill. This is a great instrumental track, and the rest of the record veers between these two extremes. I really like this Traffic album for \\"Glad\\" and \\"John Barleycorn\\" but the rest ain't bad, either. Since those are my favorite Traffic songs, this is my favorite Traffic album.<br /><br />\\"The huntsman, he can't hunt the fox,<br />Nor so loudly to blow his horn,<br />And the tinker he can't mend kettle nor pot,<br />Without a little Barleycorn.\\"ttle Barleycorn.\\"
B00009YXAD|3.0|This is one of the better Neil Young albums of his earlier, \\"brooding\\" years and contains some of his best-written tracks as well.  The last track, \\"Ambulance Blues\\", is an object lesson in great, poetic lyric-writing.  No weak tracks here and like classic albums should, the track order seems to be perfectly chosen.  \\"Walk On\\" is my favourite song here and is the perfect track to kick off this album just as \\"Ambulance Blues\\" is the perfect one to end it.<br /><br />Anyone who has heard \\"Decade\\" can tell you that the Young catalog is long overdue a major remastering job; this album though has been very well remastered for a surprisingly good sound quality throughout.  The only downer is the quality of the mini-lp replica sleeve a.k.a. mlps design.  It's well known that the Japanese have been for a long time and still are the masters at this sort of design and even Rhino in their Replica series have resorted wisely to outsourcing the sleeve design to Japan while retaining the remastering of the content.  Perhaps our friends from the EU should consider doing the same.  The cardboard is thin and flimsy and clumsily put together here and a lack of a plastic inner sleeve (all Japanese versions have one) makes it very difficult to keep the disc scratch-free.<br /><br />If the poor execution of the mlps doesn't bother you then this is actually great value for money given the price and the vastly improved sound quality of this album is a real treat.  This leaves me waiting and hoping our friends in Japan will get around to remastering and issuing an mlps version of \\"Decade\\", \\"Harvest\\", \\"Everybody Knows This is Nowhere\\" and \\"After the Gold Rush\\" in the manner that they are so adept at doing.<br /><br />In the meantime, this EU version will have to do as the best-sounding version of \\"On the Beach\\" that is out there albeit not the best mlps designed one.<br /><br />Recommended on quality of content and sound but not on implementation of design.

The sound bytes switch from speaker to speaker with so much speed that none of them are able to amplify what they are saying.  Perhaps the book is better.  However, the concepts taught in The Secret have worked for me, and have proven true for me.  I feel energized and focused when I listen to it on my way to work in the car.

0618680004|2.0|Like, Hitchens' \\"God is Not Great,\\" this book attracts certain types of readers with its title--the atheist and the \\"fence sitter\\" i.e. the agnostic. I doubt the Christian reviewers who claimed to have read Dawkins actually did. They have a stock pile of rationalized BS for people like Dawkins which they throw into reviews i.e. the complexity of the eye argument...<br /><br />The God Delusion does much to reinforce the \\"atheistic\\" view point but does little to influence the agnostic to the atheistic stance. Dawkins' mocking of the religious will turn off many an agnostic reader--who will most likely see his arrogance and surety comparable to that of many religious zealots.<br /><br />Too bad about that tone...<br /><br />For example, Dawkins discounts intense \\"religious experience.\\" Many agnostics I have met have had intense spiritual experiences through drugs (i.e. shrooms, weed, LSD, peyote), and albeit there is probably a scientific explanation-Dawkins doesn't delve into it.<br /><br />Although, I am intrigued by Dawkins' initial insight into the emergence of religious ideology, he makes no distinction between fundamentalists and other mainstream believers. I find this unreasonable.<br /><br />Considering Dawkins is a scientist, I was disappointed by his outright denial of the biological implications of religious humans--i.e. the morality associated with religion has done much to enhance humanity's reproductive traits.<br /><br />In short, I fear that Dawkins proposes a different sort of fundamentalism--militant atheism.

Hosseini writes women SO well (and so many don't) that it's hard to believe he's male.  This story absolutely broke my heart, as it will yours, but in a very satisfying way.  I challenge anybody to NOT cry during the last section of the book!  Hosseini is an amazing author and reinforces the old saying, '\\"Write what you know.\\"'
0345350499|2.0|My 2 stars were awarded based on the imagination and depth of this book. My experience would be more like half of a star, but considering the work and effort the author obviously put into this novel, I believe in giving credit where credit is due.     Based on the reviews I have seen of this book, I have found that I may in fact be the only woman who did not like this book. It came heavily recommended by my mother (who is an avid MZB fan, along with her husband I might add) since I tend to gobble up any retelling of the Arthurian legends. Imagine my immense disappointment to find I utterly loathed one of the main characters! Time and time again the character of Gwenhwyfar proved to be a reinforcement of so many negative stereotypes associated with women. She immediately views the one other woman in the story who is close to Arthur (Morgaine) as a rival and proceeds to regard anything associated with her as devil-worship per se. Again, I was surprised how this \\"pro-feminist\\" retelling could have a major female, who is not supposed to be a villain, continually act like one! She repeatedly demands for the dominance of Christianity in Arthur's court, yet when given the chance to bed Lancelot, fully engages in a threesome with him and Arthur! After which she proceeds to blame Arthur over this \\"pagan-act\\" even though she continues with her adulterous ways! Make no mistake I am was not repeatedly offended by this character on moral grounds, solely on her hypocrisy!     This Queen is petty, weak, overly dramatic, hypocritical and fanatical at the same time! She practically made me ashamed to be a Jennifer! I am not sure how others feel, but if I truly hate a main character, in a book it makes reading an arduous task worse than pulling teeth. I have no problem with lengthy novels but dealing with this twit till the end truly gave a sour note to my week in hawaii! I kept hoping for (and my mother kept reassuring me there was) some redemption in this story, but alas! The onlyjoy I got at the end was that it was that end and I would never have to suffer her character again!    If you are looking for a truly epic and breath-taking Arthurian retelling, I recommend the series by A.A. Attanasio that begins with The Dragon and the Unicorn.
B000IOM0WY|2.0|Regular DVD in upscale player is better than Blu-ray.  For some reason there are a significant amount of artifacts to the point of a distracting line in mid-screen.  If you haven't trashed your regular/upscale DVD player, then buy the regular DVD and save some money.  Don't get me wrong, the movie itself is fantastic...just the quality of its current Blu-ray version is sub-par.  I'd return it, if I could.
B000A2WDEO|3.0|Japan of the future is in crisis.  The BR program is one method of solving society's problems.  A ninth-grade class is chosen and then dumped on an island.  They are given supplies which include a random weapon (gun, axe, bow, etc.).  They have an explosive collar locked around their necks which monitors them.  The rules are simple.  Kill everyone else and don't be in the restricted areas at the right time.  If there is no winner in the time allotted, all will be killed.    We get to watch as various members of the class have to come to grips with being hunted and becoming a hunter.  It is impossible to survive without killing your friends.  Suddenly the class have their lives turned completely upside down as they come to realize that in a few days the best they can hope for is that one of them will survive.  Each student deals with this in their own way.    Due to the opening scene (showing the smiling winner) and later comments about smiles, I expected a different ending (or at least one with a few more answers).  Mostly this is just an excuse to see teenagers kill one another.  I don't know how creating a teen who dislikes authority and is willing to kill will help Japan's problems but it doesn't seem that important to the film.  I enjoyed most of the film, but the lackluster ending made me consider that I had wasted my time watching the film.  Others may not feel that way.  If you want to see Japanese teens doing each other in then this film is definitely for you but if you are looking for solid plotting then this one may disappoint.
B0000C9JFO|3.0|\\"The Spanish Apartment\\" follows Xavier, a French student who decides to improve his chance of getting a job in finance by studying a year in Spain. He leaves behind his girlfriend, but soon finds consolation in his fun roommates and somewhere else (I don't want to give too much away). The characters feel real, and that is one of the merits of the movie. The actors are also quite good. But the screenplay is never engaging enough to make us care much about Xavier.
B00009WNVV|5.0|I've seen this movie DVD several times already, and each time I like it more.  In fact, I think it's the best film musical I've ever seen.  The songs--one right after another, the spectacular dancing, the two gorgeous women--what more could you ask.  Although I've never been a fan of Richard Gere (I know women are), I thought he was terrific here, singing and dancing.    The biggest surprise, however, is Renee Zellweger.  I've liked most of her movies where she played dramatic roles.  Song and dance were not her bag, but she was great and deserved a highest award for the accomplishment in this movie.  Her \\"Roxie\\" number and the finale duo were sensational.  Then there is Catherine Zeta Jones who received and deserved an Academy Award for this movie.  I never saw anyone tear the place up before as she did in \\"All That Jazz\\" and even moreso in \\"I Can't Do It Alone.\\"    There just isn't a flaw.  I'm truly surprised that anyone found fault with this movie.  It's a wow.  I wish I could give it more stars than five.

B000006OBQ|5.0|Maybe you're like me, a little younger, you grew up on stuff like Rush and Black Sabbath.  Frank Sinatra was that old guy on the Jerry Lewis telethon.  He was joke fodder on SNL.  But you're getting a little older and you're tastes are branching out a bit.  If so, buy this album.  It will explain in no uncertain way why Sinatra is the icon he still is, and deserves to be.  Backed by the amazing Count Basie and his orchestra Sinatra never misses a beat.  He works the crowd, sings flawlessly, and takes you through every emotion from laughter (his monologue is a riot) to sadness (One For My Baby) and hits every point in between. Unlike so many of todays prepackaged and self proclamed celebrities, Sinatra got where he was through sheer force of talent and personality. He didn't just show up for the gig, he delivered a master performance.  It's just lucky for us the tape was rolling.
B000NVIGC0|3.0|Jeff Tweedy got his name from rock and roll, but there's little rock and roll on this album. Sky Blue Sky is pretty, commercial, and destined for heavy rotation in Starbucks and on XM Loft and Clear Channel's lite rock stations. It may even cross over to the smooooth jazz stations.    This is one of those rare albums where, the more I listen to it, the less I like it. At first, on casual listening, it sounded OK. On serious listening, Sky Blue Sky breaks into mostly filler for four really good songs: \\"Let's Not Get Carried Away,\\" \\"Walken,\\" \\"What Light,\\" and \\"Hate It Here.\\" The remaining tracks sound like Norah Jones if she'd hired Carlos Santana, Joe Satriani, or some other shameless noodler to play lead guitar. The comparisons to Summerteeth are valid, but Sky Blue Sky is a weaker album.    \\"Impossible Germany\\" is impossible to listen to. It may be the most annoying song since Europe's \\"The Final Countdown.\\"    Sky Blue Sky is alright, but it's the least interesting of the four Uncle Tupelo spinoff albums released in the past year. Jay Bennett's \\"The Magnificent Defeat\\" owns a lot of the genius behind Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Gob Iron's \\"Death Songs for the Living\\" and Son Volt's \\"The Search\\" own Jay Farrar's underrated songwriting and musicianship.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|It's always nice to buy a singer/songwriter album now and then after hearing that overproduced radio-friendly rock that's come out lately. When expressions like \\"taking the band to the next level\\", \\"most heaviest but our most melodic\\" and the favorite \\"this is our best record ever\\", it gets a little...familiar. Enter someone with just a guitar and a voice and all seems right in music land. So it's nice to pick up a record like Brandi Carlile's sophomore album \\"The Story\\" and you feel good that you're discovering a new talent.    The album begins with \\"Late Morning Lullaby\\", folk/rock with Brandi's voice belting out the chorus. A friend said she sounded like Shania Twain at times (especially the prechorus) but it's obvious this one's better at singing. The title track is one of the highlights of the disc with it starting out fairly minimilist and quiet before it picks up and Brandi showcases that voice of hers. It helps that the more grittier guitars come in as well but not overdoing it, helping the emotion of the singing rather than bury it.    \\"My Song\\", with its U2-esque guitar line and big chorus is another standout on the record with its more rockier tone. \\"Have You Ever\\" is also another nice track with a bluegrass kind of feel and multiple voices going on during the chorus. Another one of the standouts even though it's not as loud as The Story is \\"Cannonball\\" which is predominantly acoustic-based with Brandi dueting with another singer. You can almost imagine the smoke-filled tavern on this one. The last stretch kind of run together. It's not that their bad songs, it's just that they follow a similar tempo and arrangements and it's hard to differentiate them unless you listen to one for awhile.    It's great to see emerging talents right as their talent/recognition starts to develop. Most of the time you always catch artists who've been around for awhile and already on her 2nd record, Brandi Carlile is one to watch out for...here's hoping she doesn't pull a Nelly Furtado and goes all sex bomb on us. Jeez.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|As a diehard Stevie fan for over 20 years, even I was a little skeptical about another \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation.  After all, I own \\"Timespace\\" and \\"Enchanted.\\"  Nevertheless, I made the purchase, more interested in the accompanying DVD than the CD.    Was I in for a surprise . . .while I do agree with other reviewers that the CD is missing some key Stevie songs, some of the remixes on here are just incredible.  I especially enjoyed the \\"club remix\\" of \\"Dreams.\\"    The real gem in this purchase, however, is the DVD.  Seeing these old videos again was amazing.  What I got the most enjoyment out of was listening to the commentary Stevie provided about each video.   You feel like she is watching the videos with you, filling in the blanks behind the storyline of the videos, remembering details even she has forgotten as she watches these long-lost treasures.  Additionally, in each video, she comments on her wardrobe and especially her hair, which is hysterical!    A must-have for any Stevie fan.  You will listen and watch over and over again.
B000KQGP2G|5.0|There are basically two types of progressive rock bands.  The ones that are progressive because they sound like Yes or King Crimson, and the ones that are genuinely doing something new.  Pain of Salvation falls into the second of these two catagories, and Scarsick in a stunning example of just what they're capable of.  Though fitting neatly into the POS catalog it is greatly influenced by modern heavy metal, rap and even disco.  It both draws upon American music and society for it's inspiration and levels harsh criticism on both.  It is the heaviest album they have done in a while, but is strikingly beautiful in many of its melodies.  Gildenlow in a superb vocalist, one of my favorites.  Whether he's rapping, screaming, or singing in a soft falsetto he is capable of doing things with his voice that few singers can.  The entire band is superb.  As I have said with other bands, their virtuosity never overwhelms their musicianship. In the end this is a band that is constantly trying to cover new ground.  It may take a few listens to get accustomed to the new territory.  But once you get familiar you'll be glad you made the trip.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This is masterpiece from dave 'metal pioneer' mustaine. Nothing to say because RIP is near perfect. The bonus track make it more exclusive. Buy it now and enjoy the cd.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|As previous reviewers have pointed out, you either love Norah Jones or you hate her.  Sadly some seem far to concerned with what she looks like rather than the content of the music.<br /><br />Yes, it is a little slower than her first 2 albums but still somehow retains that 'southern feel' to it.  It realy should not matter that she is a popular musician or even that she looks good.  If that puts you off music you may as well throw away your entire record collection!<br /><br />This album more represents a progression from her second album, more piano and less of an 'upbeat jazz' feel than her first album had.  This may not be everyones choice of music and it does have more of a feel of 'background music' when inviting friends 'round for a meal or something you would listen to after a hard day (myself, in the car to take my mind off rush hour traffic)<br /><br />Worth a listen.  A damn sight better than the God-awful Amy Winehouse anyway.
B00009V7P8|5.0|If there's ever been an album so hopelessly beautiful as Damien Rice's \\"O,\\" I've yet to hear it.  It's not a glittering beauty like the early music of Enya, nor a razor-edged beauty like Radiohead's \\"[[ASIN:B000002UJQ OK Computer]]\\" or the falsetto of Coldplay's Chris Martin.  No, \\"O\\" is in a category all by itself.  The title, a single, apparently meaningless letter, is so fitting for the record.  Like the record, there's a beautiful simplicity to it, but close examination reveals a delightful intricacy.  And so it is with Damien Rice's music.  The Irish folk troubadour's sincerety, clear in each of his heart-tuggingly poetic compositions, is a welcoming nakedness that shines through his bittersweet vocals.    The magic's in the arrangements as well as the vocals, though - the echoing guitar and longing cello in the record's highlight, the dazzling \\"Blower's Daughter\\" (well-used as the main theme for Mike Nichol's screen adaptation of \\"[[ASIN:B000NQRV4O Closer]]\\"); the mixture of classic and contemporary instruments which fall like an avalanche in \\"Cheers Darlin'\\"; the consciously insane opera in the wonderful \\"Eskimo.\\"  Rice is aware of the craziness of this world, but he's more interested in the simple beauty of it: things like the wind in your hair or the sun setting over a field.  Lisa Hannigan's smooth, breezy vocals support Rice, who knows just when to let her soar.  In fact, Rice knows when to do everything.  His timing is impeccable.  He knows when to sing, when to let Hannigan sing, when to bring in the violins - even when to let the opera singer loose.    There are by no standards any bad or even lackluster pieces on \\"O.\\"  There are some that are more extraodinary than others, however: along with \\"Blower's Daughter,\\" the reflective \\"Cold Water,\\" the bitter \\"Cheers Darlin',\\" the wise \\"Volcano,\\" the another-day folk of \\"Older Chests,\\" and the soaring lunacy that is \\"Eskimo\\" (hang around throughout \\"Eskimo\\" to hear two hidden tracks, the excellent, bombastic\\"Prague\\" and Hannigan's cynical take on \\"Silent Night\\").  As an added bonus, each song works equally well seperately or together with the rest of the album.  I'd highly recommend buying the album as opposed to downloading the songs, though.  Almost impossibly beautiful, \\"O\\" was one of the best records of 2003 (the best?) and remains one of the best of the decade.
0790729644|3.0|Not a fun western. Much brutishness and grimness. No wisecracking colorful sidekick to provide comic relief. No promising union of hero and maiden at the end. No pat on the back for riding the community of desperados or crooked big wheels. No indian conflicts, dramatic train or bank robberies, nor exciting gold strikes. No wagon train hoedowns nor other pleasant social events. No Mr. nice guy whose tough when he has to be. The women are all mindless abused plain-looking whores, not glamorous dance hall queens, and are ultimately responsible for all the violence in the film. This is a message film. The main point seems to be to present a more realistic picture of life and violence in the wild west than the typical western and to deglamorize shootouts and gunslingers. Another message is  that alcohol(and by extension, some other psychoactive drugs) makes certain men violent or abusive. Eastwood's character was such a man.  <br />   The plot surrounds conflicting ideas of the just punishment for the face slashing of a prostitute by a cowboy customer whose manhood she insulted. The saloon owner nearly decides to shoot the cowboy, but then decides to defer to the authority of the sheriff, \\"Little\\" Bill. Bill  initially suggests a whipping as being appropriate for the cowboy and his friend, who helped hold down the prostitute. But this doesn't satisfy the Madam, who demands a public hanging. The saloon keeper now demands a fine, payable to him, for damage to his \\"property\\". Bill finally decides on a fine alone. The prostitutes are incredulous at this sentence. To them this says the legal system regards them as mere property, equivalent to slaves or horses. Most viewers would probably regard a death sentence as too harsh, but a fine as too light. Perhaps Little Bill's original suggestion of a whipping would have satisfied the prostitutes after they witnessed it and there would not have been any more violence connected with the incident. This \\"mistake\\" left the prostitutes as well as most of the other town's people unsatisfied, and would ultimately cost Bill his life. The prostitutes offered a bounty for the heads of the 2 cowboys so as to achieve their idea of justice, and this initiates the rest of the action of this film. In a broader application, the complications surrounding this incident serves as a warning that even domestic insults and assaults can sometimes result in a cascade of revenge and legalistic injuries, jailings and murders, sometimes involving people quite unrelated to the original incident.   <br />   This film showcases the injustices and ambiguities of vigilante justice and its perpetrators. The reformed ex-gunslinger drunk(Eastwood), who initially took up his weapons again only to make some money to help support his children and to satisfy the revenge wishes of others, eventually tranforms himself temporarily into a drunk vigilante who murdered those not involved as well as those involved in the death of his long time partner. This is but one of several incidents of unjust killings(including at least one of the cowboys involved in the slashing).   <br />However, we have to balance this against the frequent shortcomings of legalistic justice, including the expenses involved, frequent mistakes, the influence of money, status, race and corruption, the frequent inability to identify, capture or convict perpetrators, the endless appeals and frequent dissatisfaction with sentences as too lenient or too harsh and being carried out far too long after the crime is comitted. Both have their pluses and minuses. The popularity of films where the hero eliminates the villain in a vigilante fashion suggests that vigilante justice, when done appropriately, is acceptable to many people and often preferable to legalized justice. However, the legal establishment is reluctant to legitimize it, except perhaps in self-defense cases, which are often subject to interpretation. It recognizes the gave dangers of too frequent use ofvigilante justice, besides the fact that this seriously undermines its authority.

B000P2A256|4.0|The length of time between the release of Maroon 5's megahit debut, \\"[[ASIN:B00006879E Songs About Jane]],\\" and their subsequent album, suggested to many that the group may be a one-hit wonder.  Now, five years later, they've returned with their sophomore effort, \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\"  It's an album vastly different from the group's debut, which may throw off those fans looking for more of the early-morning-coffee funk sound of \\"Songs About Jane.\\"  Instead, \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\" is loud, structured, glittery, and maybe a little overproduced.    Band leader Adam Levine definitely isn't afraid to show his influences, and he has many which are easy to spot throughout the record, including Talking Heads on \\"Kiwi\\" and particularly the Police (the opening chords of \\"Won't Go Home Without You\\" are clearly inspired by \\"Every Breath You Take,\\" and sections of \\"Can't Stop\\" sound like vintage Police), which Maroon 5 opened for during their reunion tour.  But Maroon 5 lacks the upperclass, individual rock of these bands; instead, the artist they most warrant comparison to is Hall & Oates.  The songs on \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\" have the same sort of glossy, catchy, proudly pop finish, and like Hall & Oates, Levine can accept and be proud of Maroon 5 for what it is: a pop band.  Rather than trying his hand at the deep, intelligent rock of Damien Rice or any of his influences, Levine strives to create the perfect pop song.    That's not to say that \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\" isn't intelligent, though, because the smarts necessary to write a powerful and endurant pop song aren't as easy to come by as some like to think.  These songs are sweet, satisfying, and hold up to repeated listens quite well, as does the album itself.  The lyrics flow, and through Levine's vocals sound convincingly sincere, supported by melodies designed to make ears happy but also to stimulate.  But what makes the album really work is that, despite their assorted and heavy influences, the band doesn't try to be retro or reference hit groups of old.  Instead, they play all this Hall & Oates-ish music as though it were brand-new, never-heard, a revolution in music.  It works: this 80s soul pop sound sounds as fresh and new as ever.    How much you'll enjoy this album comes down to whether or not you appreciate pop music and whether or not you're expecting a \\"Songs About Jane 2.\\"  Pop music can be as good as any other style, a fact all-too-often ignored, but Maroon 5 return on a mission to prove that.  They succeed: \\"It Won't Be Soon Before Long.\\" is just short of pop perfection, and will no doubt prove to be one of the best records of 2007.  It's an album that was worth waiting for, be the wait long or short, and it's guaranteed to make the wait for the group's next effort a whole lot more endurable, and indeed, even enjoyable.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|There are many positive reviews for this version of Jane Eyre, and I agree with the majority of them. I won't repeat them here. Should you buy this DVD? Definitely. The only thing that stopped me from giving this production a 5 star rating, is that they messed with the story line. Why, oh why, does some screenwriter, whether in Hollywood or London, think that they can do a classic better than the book's author? What egos! I would have liked to have seen more scenes from Jane's childhood, as this is the foundation for who she is as an adult, and Charlotte Bronte was thorough in the book in helping us understand Jane through her upbringing. If they needed to increase the length of the production, why not expand it with scenes that are from the book, instead of making up a storyline which makes it more of a \\"fairy tale\\" ending than the original author intended? I think Charlotte Bronte was well aware of the balance of both the joys and the sorrows in life, and portrayed Jane's life in a realistic manner. For heaven's sake, WHY MESS WITH A GOOD THING!?
1591841666|5.0|Yes, it is a thin-ish book... but how thick does a book need to be that deals with a simple subject?

B000PHX4VA|5.0|To kickoff their overwhelmingly-anticipated reunion tour, A&M Records has released a new compilation of the Police's finest work.  Unlike their previous compilations, this new compilation, titled simply \\"The Police,\\" spans two discs, with 14 songs on each disc.  Those old one-disc compilations always seemed shallow to me - collecting their #1's just wasn't enough.  I felt that only through a 2-disc set could those unfamiliar with the Police get a feel for the group.  \\"The Police\\" accomplishes that goal, providing a fine sense of the group's style through 28 tracks, ranging from their rare first single, \\"Fallout,\\" to \\"Tea in the Sahara,\\" which finished off the original LP of the group's final album.    \\"The Police\\" has all the greats - you know, \\"Roxanne,\\" \\"Message in a Bottle,\\" \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me,\\" \\"Every Little Thing She Does is Magic,\\" \\"Every Breath You Take,\\" etc. - along with a number of less-appreciated gems like \\"Demolition Man,\\" \\"Driven to Tears,\\" and \\"Bring on the Night.\\"  The breakdown of the songs picked from each album is as follows:    - \\"[[ASIN:B00008BRBG Outlandos d'Amour]]\\" (1978): 6 tracks.  - \\"[[ASIN:B00008BRDX Reggatta de Blanc]]\\" (1979): 4 tracks.  - \\"[[ASIN:B00008BRDV Zenyatta Mondatta]]\\" (1980): 5 tracks.  - \\"[[ASIN:B00008BRDW Ghost in the Machine]]\\" (1981): 4 tracks.  - \\"[[ASIN:B00008BRB5 Synchronicity]]\\" (1983): 8 tracks.    Every single great from \\"Outlandos d'Amour\\" is contained in the collection, and for that the set deserves some applause.  Only one great is absent from \\"Reggatta de Blanc,\\" but it's one of the band's most popular songs, \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You.\\"  Two of the band's very finest are absent from \\"Zenyatta Mondatta,\\" Sting's post-apocalyptic anthem \\"When the World is Running Down, You Make the Best of What's Still Around,\\" and his delightfully pop \\"Man in a Suitcase.\\"  At least two tracks are overlooked from \\"Ghost in the Machine,\\" \\"Rehumanize Yourself\\" and Andy Summers' bombastic fan favorite \\"Omegaman\\" (and possibly Sting's mystical \\"Secret Journey\\" as well).  Needless to say, with an almost suffocating 8 tracks present, nothing from \\"Synchronicity\\" is overlooked.  But the omission of those beauties mentioned above, 5 or 6 total, is upsetting.  I would also have loved to see \\"I Burn for You,\\" from the \\"Brimstone & Treacle\\" soundtrack, here.  It's one of the group's most brilliant compositions and has been sorely neglected for years.    A rather curious aspect of this collection is the placement of the tracks.  They are presented chronologically by album, but not in the order they would appear on the album, which is odd.  Odder still is the decision to do that, and then to put the dreamy \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" at the end of the collection rather than the band's signature tune, \\"Every Breath You Take.\\"  Why not let \\"Tea in the Sahara\\" drift off into its ethereality and then finish things off with a bang with \\"Every Breath\\"?  This is a minor detractor, though.    As a die-hard Police fan, I have my beefs with this compilation, but I would still highly recommend it to those unfamiliar with the band.  They were truly one of the greatest groups of all time, and \\"The Police\\" is a fine way to get a sense of their style.  However, due to the problems listed above, it's by no means the definitive collection, though it is the best one so far.  All in all, it's a great career overview which I highly recommend.
B00005UKKF|5.0|This DVD is actually pretty good. It has the links to either watch the full show or to watch each performance separately.     Britney Spears gives a really good show in this HBO live from Las Vegas presentation. Her songs are very catchy and the cameras are very good on following her and catching good close ups to Britney and her dancers.     This DVD has a really cool beginning, as well as a fun little band video. Britney and her team really ran the extra mile with this concert as it's really entertaining. It has really good choreographed dances, as well as special effects, and lots of costume changes. Also you get to see at least one Elvis there in the mix.     While the show starts with fire explosions and very high teck looking. It ends really cool with rain and a very nice sensual \\"baby one more time\\" that I kind of like better than the original one.      It's a fun concert, didn't find any mistakes on this one, defiantly one of Britney's greatest concerts or her time.
B00004YA66|5.0|Frequency is a remarkable movie.  I just discovered it and am glad to see that others continue to add their comments here.  First, I must applaud the premise - the use of a ham radio as the device that connects father and son in a supernatural way.  My uncle was a ham radio operator and even taught classes.  It had a tremendous mystique all its own.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is fabulous.  He effortlessly portrays Frank Sullivan, a man who is passionate about his values, devoted to his family, and larger than life as a fireman.  The movie opens to this father's heroic rescue of a pair of workers trapped underground after a tanker crash.  He comes right home to the wife he loves, the son he loves -- John, his \\"Little Chief\\" -- in the home he loves; he has it all.  Moving forward thirty years, we meet the adult John.  James Caviezel tears me to pieces in these early scenes as we learn that this father died in a fire 30 years ago.  John is a cop working homicide.  He is still living in the house he grew up in.  He did not completely recover from his father's death.  He drinks to find numbness and his girlfriend (who he loves) walks out on him.  But he is a good man in his own right.  His mother's phone number is on his speed-dial and he takes the time to stay involved in her life.  On this difficult night in October 1999, as he approaches the anniversary of his father's death, his childhood friend Gordo (Noah Emmerich - The Truman Show) helps set up his father's old ham radio that they find looking for fishing gear under the stairs.  Later, with the aurora borealis glistening overhead, father and son make contact on this radio over the distance of 30 years.  Awesome!  My favorite scene on the DVD is captioned \\"Catching Up,\\" and takes place after a skeptical Frank, up to his ears in smoke and flames, follows his son's frantic warning that he should \\"go the other way\\" to safety rather than the death that John remembered.  On returning home unscathed, Frank, accidentally wakes his six-year old son, evolving into a joyous bike-riding lesson.  He then finds adult John's voice on the ham and they catch up.  At one point, Frank asks adult John if he is still his \\"Little Chief\\" and James Caviezel's tearful reply \\"I'm trying to be\\" is profound.  Dennis Quaid and James Caviezel run with their roles here.  They are two great American actors at work.<br /><br />The entire cast is wonderful.  Elizabeth Mitchell as wife and mother plays so much love and strength into her role.  The screenplay, by Toby Emmerich, brother of Noah, is tight, tender and imaginative.  (The brothers do a great commentary together on the DVD special features.)  The crime-thriller sub-plot is gripping and the ending satisfying.ix-year old son, evolving into a joyous bike-riding lesson.  He then finds adult John's voice on the ham and they catch up.

B000M3452Y|5.0|LCD Soundsystem are a US electronic rock group, with a very British sound, a fact not lost on them as they sing \\"and for those of you who still think we're from england / we're not, no\\" on the buzzing, incredibly catchy \\"North American scum\\".<br /><br />The album comprises just 9 songs, averaging 5 minutes each. Each track takes 1 to 2 minutes to build up to the vocal delivery.<br /><br />Case in point is \\"Someone great\\" with loads of layering and electronic effects building up to a Human League-like song with eighties sounding synths.<br /><br />Similarly, \\"Get innocuous\\" takes about 2 minutes to build to a shimmery dance song (with disembodied vocals) which takes no prisoners.<br /><br />\\"Time to get away\\" has lead singer James Murphy singing and yelping over a pulsing guitar drenched house groove. The title track is a sparse but hypnotic effects laden song. \\"All my friends\\" is a pulsing U2-esque song.<br /><br />Closing is the lone ballad; \\"New York, I love you but you're bringing me down\\", starting off deceptively like a Coldplay song, building up to a blistering guitar solo, and an unexpected twist at the end. They sound like a totally different band on this one.<br /><br />It does take a few plays to get into but once it gets into your head, you can't get it out. One of the best dance CDs of the year!
B000OVLBEO|2.0|When you get a power struggle goin'! Originally David S. Goyer wrote this as hard as hell rated R horror superhero movie. Ghost Rider is a, how do you say it, demon from hell! The studios stepped in, and along with Mark Steven Johnson butchered that notion. Notice that Goyer only gets a production credit.   <br /><br />  <br /><br />I used to believe that the reason this was delayed so long was because of the effects. That's a lie, it was delayed due to the fact they had to scrape the original vision and start from scratch.  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />Johnny Blaze is a wuss who drinks jelly beans from a martini glass.

I'm tired of the EMO villians popping up in comic book films.  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />The visual effects rocked, they nailed the penance stare...  <br /><br />  <br /><br />The biggest gripe, and I wonder why it hasn't been brought up was the ending that was pretty much frame by frame the original Blade ending.  <br /><br />When the souls enter Blackheart looks just like when the souls. enter Deacon Frost. In addition to some Blade dialogue. \\"I have all of his strengths, and none of his weaknesses\\"...  <br /><br />  <br /><br />The film was a hackjob. The director's cut did not redeem the original like the Daredevil cut redeemed that original.  <br /><br />  <br /><br />  <br /><br />2 stars for effects!
B000MGUZM0|5.0|\\"Neon bible\\" is Canadian rock group Arcade Fire's sophomore disc. I'd read loads of glowing reviews of this CD (which usually makes me wary) but guess what, it is brilliant!<br /><br />Built around the core of husband and wife team R&eacute;gine Chassagne (who does most of the singing) and Win Butler, their debut \\"Funeral\\" was critically acclaimed and nominated for Grammys.<br /><br />Their music is melancholic, but highly melodic, incorporating orchestral arrangements, choirs, organs, and even accordion, giving them a sound like no other band.<br /><br />\\"Black wave/bad vibrations\\" is a two part song, the first sunny, upbeat half sung by Win, while the moodier second half (with haunting angelic harmonies) is sung by R&eacute;gine. It is simply stunning!<br /><br />It flows into \\"Ocean of noise\\" which opens with the sound of thundering waves, leading into a brilliant swelling midtempo song drenched in guitars and organ. My favourite song; haunting and beautiful.<br /><br />\\"My body is a cage\\" starts off as an organ driven blues song, progressively layered to an almost hymnal fervor.<br /><br />For upbeat songs, we have the shimmery \\"No cars go\\" (describing an Amish-like existence), \\"The well and the lighthouse\\" , and the sunny \\"Keep the car running\\".<br /><br />\\"(Antichrist television blues)\\" has a country feel, while the organ/accordion driven \\"Intervention\\" is simply grandiose.<br /><br />The CD has already made #2 in the US and UK, and I'm sure it will earn more accolades (Grammys) down the line.
B000P0J024|5.0|Usually these supergroups are tedious affairs. When a bunch of rock stars get together, the music is often mediocre, because of the individual egos of each member not allowing himself to be part of a group, or they want to show deference to the others by supressing their talents. This is neither.  The music on these 2 volumes (I'm still searching for Vol. 2...last I heard it was in an ancient toilet esconded in the Himalayan mountains) is really amazing.  The 21 songs on the original albums are all gems.  There isn't one throwaway track.  Vol. 3 rocks harder than Vol. 1, but I still love both.  Favorite songs are Handle With Care, Dirty World, Tweeter and the Monkey Man (my favorite off of Vol. 1), She's My Baby, Poor House, and Wilbury Twist.  The playing is masterful. And it has a real laid back feel to it, like it actually was fun for The Traveling Wilburys to make an album together.  It has all the hallmarks of a Jeff Lynne production (which is a good thing), yet it feels like a real group effort.  Some can argue it's Dylan's best work in the 80's.  These are 2 wonderful albums which grow more and more wonderful everytime you listen to them.
1592401791|3.0|This is a very biased book. Although it provides a lot of details on how the Beatles recorded their songs and the recording techniques they used at that time, the book seems very biased. While Emerick writes many nice things about Paul and himself, he has only a few good things to say about John and George Martin. He is also unfairly critical of George and Ringo. The problem here is that these biases appear to be related to his inability to be friends with all the four Beatles. Since he and Paul were good friends, he says nice things about him. John, George and Ringo were not his friends, so he criticizes them heavily. I think this is unacceptable. He should have been able to be objective and willing to show respect to other people even if they were not his friends.   Emerick also claims that Paul was the true leader of the Beatles and the one who took them to new musical directions. But his book appears to contradict this claim (and several others) since two of the songs that really changed their musical direction and opened up new dimensions, as he explained in detail, were \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and \\"A Day in The Life\\" both John's songs. Moreover, anytime there was a discussion in the studio, he explains, it was John who would put an end to it by making a decision rather than Paul. Thus, based on his descriptions, John was the leader, not Paul. Emerick also says that George could not play a guitar solo, which is strange since some of George's solos have been considered among the best of all time (e.g., \\"Something\\"). Finally, he seems to diminish the role of George Martin and places himself as almost the only responsible for the new sounds the Beatles were achieving starting with the \\"Revolver\\" album. It is just difficult to believe that a 20 year old was more influential that the 40 year old George Martin.  As a conclusion, I would say this is an interesting but biased book. Because it is a memoir, the facts that are mentioned here may or may not be true. I wouldrecommend it to well-informed Beatles fans who want to know some details about the recording process.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I have only watched the first 4 shows, but I am mezmerized by almost everything that is on the video.  This is great viewing for many hours.
B000O179EA|5.0|I'm not going to comment on the film itself as you can read up on the film elsewhere but i'll let you know a little about the HD DVD disc itself. If your in the UK, the disc works perfectly on my Xbox 360 Add On so don't worry about buying from the US.     On the disc, there is the film itself (14 minutes extra as it's a director's cut), peter jackson's (first) feature commentary and also a trailer. There is also a 240 minute documentary about the making of the film from start to finish. I started watching it last night not realising how long it was, so i had to turn it off and i'll watch the rest tonight. Nice Layout of the disc (same as any other Universal disc) and the quality of the film is great.    I've not seen this compared to the Standard Def version of the special edition so i cannot compare them, but the HD DVD version is definately one i'd recommend.    Hope this helps...
B000PY52EU|4.0|I really liked this one despite not really knowing what to expect going in. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci really delve into their roles and make the crazy circumstances seem halfway real. Justin Timberlake ok, not great, but he didn't hurt the movie either with his limited role. I really like how the characters, music, and deep south landscape really meshed together to bring an enjoyable overall experience.
0316018953|4.0|The Overlook, by Michael Connelly, is the author's 13th novel featuring the enigmatic LAPD Detective Harry Bosch.  Bosch is one of fiction's most developed and fully realized characters.  Though this novel is shorter than most, as it was initially published in 16 parts by the New York Times, the story and mystery here are vintage Connelly.<br /><br />I had the opportunity to hear Mr. Connelly speak at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, and he described what a departure it was for him to write for the New York Times serial.  He explained that each part was to be limited to 3,000 words, so it was difficult for him to wrap up each part with a mini-cliff hanger.  It is a testament to the author's writing skills that he was able to develop this story, and to flesh it out for the purposes of this novel.  Certainly this novel is not as deep as the other Bosch books, but it is sure worth taking the journey.<br /><br />This story deals with a murder on the Overlook on Muhalland Drive in Los Angeles.  The victim is on the FBI person of interest list.  This brings the return of FBI Special Agent Rachel Walling into the picture.  The complicated relationship between Bosch and Walling is very compelling.  Bosch also has a new partner since Kiz now works for the Office of the Chief.  Bosch tries to investigate the murder with a suspicious eye towards the FBI and their secretive ways.  Bosch serves up some pretty funny one liners describing how the Feds work with the locals.  The murder turns into a homeland security investigation and becomes a race against the clock.<br /><br />This is Connelly's version of 24, although this entire story takes place in 12 hours.  Some will complain that this book is shorter and not as intricate as most of the Bosch series.  Look at it this way, some Bosch and Connelly is better than no Bosch and Connelly.  This is a quick and enjoyable read.  Enjoy it for what it is, an entertaining story with great characters by one of the best authors writing today.  I highly recommend this book and give it a strong 4-star rating.recommend this book and give it a strong 4-star rating.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|I love Linkin Park's other albums, but this one sucked.  Linkin Park has been known to have pretty clean lyrics, but on this album they say the F-word several times.  I was very disappointed, and now I can't listen to this album around my wife or any children.  As far as the music is concerned, there is probably only 1 good song on the whole album.
0316018953|5.0|My husband and I listened to this book on CD while on a road trip, and it kept us very interested and involved.  We were able to guess some of the clues, but neither of us was able to predict all of the twists and turns of the plot.  We always enjoy Michael Connelly, but this one was one of his best.  We definitely didn't see the ending coming on this one!

B000N3SRRC|5.0|I am sick and tired of over produced, political or emotional motivated music people try to identify as good rock music.  Clutch's new release is a breath of fresh air for us who are sick of this new age music that sounds all the same.  Clutch's simpley produced, riff oriented and powerful vocals leaves us with a raw and heavy rock and roll album.  The touch of blues and southern rock makes this band one of the truly best around for true rock and roll fans.  Clutch just keep improving and are getting better and better.  This is a must have!!!
0061122416|5.0|It starts out with a really interesting tale about a Sheppard in Spain, in a year that was probably a long time ago, but is still relevant to today.<br /><br />I was worried when I first saw the Capitalized Words, because usually that's a signal it's an Awful Book.  But, the book ended up being cool--really cool.  The author talks about Personal Legends.  They are the thing that you really wanted when you were a kid, but the thing that's still relevant today.  It's kind of like who you really are, deep down in your soul, and what you should pursue.  It's a cool concept, and the book has quite a few cool concepts like that.  They're all presented in the form of a story about a Sheppard who decided to pursue what he really wants in life.<br /><br />So this book talks about embracing your dreams, letting go of your fears, and doing what you are really meant to be doing.  All in a very, very positive way.<br /><br />And, as a side note, I think that everyone but me has read this book.  Well, now me, too.  Tons of people came up to me when I was reading and said, \\"That's a really cool book.\\"  I've only had that happen once before with one other book and five different people came up to me to talk to me about their experiences with this book.
0743454537|5.0|Jodi Picoult amazes me.  She always picks such controversial subjects, and can let the reader see every side of the issue.  In this book (as in some of her others), she writes each chapter from one of the character's perspective, so you really get a chance to know each character from the inside out.  This book was so touching to me - to read about the sister's relationships, as well as the main character's relationship with every other family member- the angry brother, the selfish mother, and the compassionate father (who was one of my favorite characters).  At first, the thought of having a baby only so they could be a donor for a sick sibling was very appaling to me.  However, this book is just a prime example that you really can't criticize someone for the decisions they make until you have walked a mile in their shoes.  The ending to this book will blindside you....
0374105235|5.0|This is a no frills firsthand account of a teenager's experience of running from, participating in, and subsequently rehabilitating from a civil war in Sierra Leone that lasted 11 years.    Ishmael Beah was displaced from his village when he was 12.  To survive, he joined the army and took up arms against the rebels.  Drugged with brown brown (combination of cocaine and gun powder), amphetamines and marijuana to inhibit guilt and fear, he engaged in some of the most psychotic, horrific acts until he was rescued by UNICEF when he was 15.    Following his gradual and successful rehabilitation, he was repatriated and took up residence in his uncle's house in Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.  A year later, when he was 17, Freetown was engulfed in the civil war and Ishmael was faced once again with the choice of rejoining the army or running.    Ishmael is a superb story teller and conveys, at times in detail the nightmarish life he endured for years before being rescued.  The civil war in Sierra Leone began in 1991 by the RUF (Revolutionary United Front), and lasted 11 years.  Ishmael was one of the two million (over one third of the population) displaced.  He later became a posterboy for the success of the UNICEF/UN child soldier rehabilitation/repatriation program, and ultimately escaped the horror in Sierra Leone because of it.      Thanks to Ishmael's memoir and movies such as \\"Blood Diamond\\", more of Africa's 200,000 child soldiers may successfully escape the horrors Ishmael experienced.
B000068TPN|5.0|As many of the previous reviewers mentioned, the reality of this movie made it more than just a movie in itself. Being the most accurate and realistic Vietnam movie Hollywood has ever produced, it has turned into a invaluable tool for Husbands, Sons and Fathers to be able to truly show their families just how horrific being in a combat situation was for them.  It can really open the eyes of some people that couldn't understand why Vets are still strugling to deal with the after-effects the war had on them mentally.  This is just my experience as a 34 year old father and husband and how it effected me watching this movie with my father.    I was not in the Vietnam war, but my father flew the Huey right through the thick of the battles, exactly as it shows in the movie.  He has also been a Bell Helicopter employee all his life.     I watched this movie with him when it came out on DVD, I saw it in the theatre and finally convinced him to come over and watch it with me when it came out on DVD.  See, my dad is not a big movie fan, he has a ranch here in Texas and isn't much impressed with all the Hollywood flair and glorification they used in the other movies.  I could tell this was different when about 1/3 of the way through I looked over and he was intently watching the movie and had not said one word.  When it was over, he simply said \\"Wow, I never thought a movie would hit so close to home, that was pretty darn close to real\\".      That's when a movie became more than \\"just\\" a movie.  We watched it again, but this time he told me stories I have never heard about his tour, details of how Mom and him lived on base like that, things I never knew but am very thankful that the movie brought back memories he had forgotten and I heard a part of his life I had only speculated about.    It was great listening to him point out parts of the movie and explaining how accurate a certain part was and how that's just how it was like on another part. There were some really incredible events that he lived through over there, I mean amazing stories I would have never known about.  I never even knew he had been that involved in the action, he never really would go into detail, but this movie have him a picture to use to help me visualize the fear and horror that he and the other front line soldiers had to endure.    This movie still had some Hollywood flair to it, but when a movie can create that kind of impact on someone, and create an unforgetable evening spent with my father learning about his past, it is worth 5 + stars to me. We watched it 3 times since then, and those moments spent with my father are forever going to be remembered by myself.    Amazing movie, one of the best ever put on film, period.
0143038419|5.0|This is a must have for anyone that needs the story to really engage the reader and forget about thier surroundings. When you read this book you almost feel the emotions that Liz experiences as she goes through starting with her breakdown early in the story all the way through her finding herself and love at the end of the story. I normally would not pick up or be drawn to a book like this one. I'm a reader of mystery and suspense novels. I stumbled upon it when the intructor at my bikram yoga class read a page during our cool down to help us focus and relax. The story just grabed me and I had to run out and buy the book. Gilbert is so decriptive you feel like you are actually in Italy, India and Indonesia. I did not want to put the book down! Definately a must read.
B0000009N1|2.0|I see that mostly everyone is rating this album 5 stars, so I must be wrong but I just don't like it.  I have other Zappa cd that I like a lot, like \\"Overnight Sensation\\", \\"Apostrophe\\", \\"Joe's Garage I-II-II, and \\"Sheik Yerbouti\\" that I enjoy a lot, but ot this one.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret has truly changed my life.  I purchased the DVD, book and audio.  People around me have noticed that things happen for me and they don't understand why or how. I followed the advice and have vision boards at home and in my office.  To me it's not about money or greed.  It's about harmony, respect for life and others and gratitude.  When I'm feeling upset or negative I stop and write down what I am happy and grateful for until the negative feeling passes.  Sounds corny but it works!!  I wish we had a more in-depth follow up to the Secret with the same participants.  A lot of people think it's about positive thinking, but it's so much more than that.  I would recommend The Secret to anyone.

B0001KZM3O|4.0|This album is special, first, it is one of a kind in the Pink Floyd discography, no other can be compared with this one.  In my mind, this is the first solo album from Roger Waters, he wrote every songs, he sings all of them also. The other guys from the band are only \\"guests\\" on this one.  It is a very dark album but very intense and emotionnal.  There is some real jewel on this cd, like \\"The Gunners Dream\\", \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\", \\"The Final Cut\\" and \\"Two suns in the sunset\\".  This is a very special album that I like a lot and I would recommand it if you like Roger Waters works like \\"Amused to death\\" for instance.

B000A3XY9Q|5.0|This is one of the best films ever made.    I should end the review there, but I guess I'll add a few other remarks, since that line alone would strike many as preposterous. Ok, first I should clarify: this is one of the best films ever made if you like the horror genre (and especially the comedy-horror sub-genre). Obviously if you hate horror films you won't think this is very good. That's fine. Usually when I see those \\"Greatest 100 movies\\" type lists, I don't like more than 2 or 3 on the entire list. Everyone has an opinion, and opinions are of necessity subjective. So if you don't like horror... run from this page, run very quickly.    Still here? Great!  Anyway, I'm not going to go over all the great stuff in the film, most people have covered that pretty well. There's gore, there's slapstick, there's a ton of sight gags and wonderfully corny lines and catch phrases. It also has some interesting characters, especially the heroic fool Ash. This is just a damn fine movie.    The packaging is certainly... interesting. The artwork inside is nice, though a depiction of the skull on the original cover would have been nice (especially since there are two blank pages). The commentary is great, with lots of entertaining stories, tons of insights and things to watch for in the movie, and some bad jokes (as one would expect). I wish they would have added another commentary or two, as there seems to be (based on what I've read) quite a bit more that could be said about this film, but I guess one will have to do. The other extras were also pretty interesting, with even the picture section (a narrated slide show) being engaging, which is a first.
B00005JPFC|4.0|Rats have always been associated with filth: they live in sewers; they eat out of the garbage; they've probably been exposed to a disease. Is it any wonder that we cringe at the thought of a rat touching the food we eat? One of the things that makes Disney/Pixar's \\"Ratatouille\\" so interesting is that this idea is intentionally turned on its head: it's about a rat with a passion for food and a talent for cooking. This story is told with charm, style, and a generous dose of humor, made even better through wonderful animation and decent voice work. I won't go so far as to say that this is the greatest Disney/Pixar film ever made, but I will say that--like all that have come before it--it's a well made film that's a lot of fun to watch.    This film cleverly breaks a clear distinction between humans and non-humans, the kind that was first demonstrated in \\"Toy Story.\\" In that film, the toys' cardinal rule was to never let a human see them walk and talk. Humans have come to believe that toys are inanimate objects; they will never be able to accept anything different. \\"Ratatouille\\" opens with the same basic principle: a rat can never interact with a human. Humans think that rats are dirty, vile creatures; they will never think otherwise. Or would they? The story centers on the unlikely relationship between a rat--Remy (Patton Oswalt)--and a human--Linguini (Lou Romano)--a relationship that clearly violates the rules of species interaction. Both characters are motivated by the desire to prove something.    Most of the film takes place in the kitchen of a troubled Parisian restaurant that was once worthy of five stars. This is where Remy winds up after being separated from his clan (the end result of a trigger-happy old woman ridding her house of vermin). This is dream come true for the little rat; Remy has always appreciated food, from the smells to the flavors to the various combinations of ingredients. He was born to be a chef. While trying to escape from the kitchen, hegets distracted by a pot of soup in desperate need of assistance. As he adds the final ingredient, he's caught by Linguini, a stumbling, bumbling wreck recently hired as a garbage collector. While he's able to prevent Remy from being seen, he's too late to prevent the soup from being served. But to everyone's surprise, the soup is a big hit with the customers.    Later that night, when alone, Remy and Linguini discover that they can communicate with each other. This is good news for Linguini; the restaurant staff believed that he cooked the wonderful soup, and the head chef--the tiny, high-strung, power-hungry Skinner (Ian Holm)--wants him to cook it again the next day. This is when Linguini and Remy form a secret partnership: Remy will be the brains behind the recipes, and Linguini will physically cook the meals.    This sets into motion the more comedic portions of the film, portions highlighted by Remy's literal puppetry of Linguini. While hiding underneath a toque, Remy is able to manipulate Linguini's arms by pulling locks of his hair. I don't think I fully appreciated the slapstick nature of these scenes; hidden beneath the talking animals and formulaic plot is a story that's more mature. I greatly appreciated the themes of friendship and cooperation, and I certainly enjoyed the developing relationship between Linguini and the aggressive yet vulnerable Colette (Janeane Garofalo). But when it comes to the comical results of Remy's puppetry, something was lacking. Maybe it was the fact that Linguini had already been established as a funny character. Nothing further was needed.    But that's my only real criticism of \\"Ratatouille.\\" The rest of the film is pleasing and light, as is expected of all family-oriented animated films. Some of the best moments involve Remy's conversations with the imaginary spirit of Gusteau (Brad Garrett), a world-class chef and founder of the restaurant. He appears whenever Remy needs a pep talk, specifically when it comes to the assertion that anyone can be a cook if he or she is in the right mindset. This character acts as a counterpoint to Remy's father, Django (Brian Dennehy), who's always unsupportive and unsatisfied. He would prefer to see his son eat garbage and avoid human contact like every other rat. But Remy is independent, and he's determined to show his father that (a) not all humans are bad, and (b) that he can make something of himself.     Unfortunately, doing so will mean having to work with Linguini, who's now letting the restaurant's success go to his head. Making matters even worse is Skinner; not only does he suspect Remy's involvement, he also panics at the prospect of Linguini taking ownership of the restaurant (for reasons I won't reveal). The biggest obstacle for all the characters is food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole), a sinister and somehow ghoulish old man. Many years ago, he wrote a scathing review of the restaurant, forcing it to drop one of its stars (another was dropped when Gusteau died). The restaurant's recent rise in popularity has come to his attention, as has the publicity surrounding Linguini. Using every mannerism of a horror movie villain, Ego personally challenges Linguini to prepare a dish worthy of a good review.    Thus, the groundwork is laid for the film's ending, which is just as amusing as it is far fetched. But plausibility doesn't even come into play here; this is a fun-filled animated film, perfect for children and generally well suited for adults. No one will care that a language barrier between French and English was completely ignored. No one will mind that only certain characters speak with a French accent. \\"Ratatouille\\" was appropriately crafted so that Remy, Linguini, and their fateful partnership will be all anyone cares about.
B00018D44U|4.0|\\"Feels Like Home\\" is a welcome addition to any fans' collection.  I gave it four stars simply because I did not think it was as good as her first or third CD.

0743289412|1.0|This is the only one of Stephen King's books that has felt like an utter waste of my time.  I can't get these hours of my life back, but at least I can recommend that you do something more productive with yours.    Why so bad?  Aside from a thin story spread over far too many pages, it's his overuse of nonsense words.  In general I have no problem with creating a vocuabulary unique to a book - King has used this technique to good effect in the past, and masterpieces such as \\"Watership Down\\", \\"A Clockwork Orange\\", and \\"Cat's Cradle\\" depend upon it.      Unfortunately, this time the author keeps up a steady barrage of too-cute language to the point that it becomes highly irritating.  \\"Smucking\\" replaces \\"f***ing\\" on nearly a once-per-page basis (or so it seemed to me).  Add to that a constant mention of \\"bools\\" (both benign and bloody), hostile and greedy \\"incunks\\", a monster regularly referred to as \\"the long boy with the piebald side\\", and the borderline-meaningless acronym \\"SOWISA\\".  God help us, there's even a \\"yum-yum tree\\".  What kind of nitwits are so enchanted with their own made-up language that they can't help but use it constantly?  It's the equivalent of watching grown adults baby-talk to each other.  Embarassing.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|I don't know why I didn't review this album a long time ago. Jimi Hendrix is one of the greatest artists in rock music, and the greatest guitarist of all time. He wasn't the fastest, but his music revolutionized so much music, and in the small amount of time he was around, as well. \\"Experience Hendrix: The Best of Jimi Hendrix\\" is an essential piece of rock and roll. It's very accessable, literally in every store I've been in, and it only goes for ten dollars.   On this 20-song compilation, you get such popular tracks as \\"Purple Haze\\", \\"Fire\\", and Jimi's highest-charter, the timeless, Bob Dylan cover \\"All Along The Watchtower\\". Of course, Jimi was influenced by a variety of music, as he shows in the incredible blues stylings of \\"Red House\\" and \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return\\"). You have such trippy songs as the soul-influenced \\"Crosstown Traffic\\", a personal favorite, the somewhat-dirty and ever-groovy \\"Foxey Lady\\", the brilliant masterpiece, \\"If 6 Was 9\\" and the \\"it's-so-trippy-I-don't-know-what-to-say\\" work of art that is \\"Bold As Love\\". Then there's the eternal beauty of \\"Little Wing\\", the funky, post-humous, \\"Dolly Dagger\\" and his immortal genius of the Woodstock recording of \\"Star Spangled Banner\\". Of course, there are more than that, but this just goes to show what a musician Jimi Hendrix was!   All in all, an excellent collection that should belong in every classic rock fan's library. After this, you might wanna check out \\"Band of Gypsys\\", as it shows Jimi's stunning live work. Although artists like Jimi Hendrix, Cream and Led Zeppelin may stir controversy, I always believe that it's what you personally think of the music. And I, for one, believe Jimi Hendrix's music is timeless, awesome and extremely influential. Hope you all love this one, peace!
B000055ZDT|5.0|Whoa! Great doom metal by this British power trio. Saw the band on this actual tour. Cuts here I found myself playing several times to obtain even more brain damaging effects were \\"Vinum Sabbathi\\", the fifteen-minute; four-part epic \\"Weird Tales / Electric Frost / Golgotha / Altar Of Melektaus\\", \\"Barbarian\\" and the closing, twenty-minute title track \\"Dopethrone\\". Notice the music on this CD might not be so hard, loud or even fast but nonetheless, it's extremely H-E-A-V-Y! Highly recommended, if you dig this genre.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Short, sweet and to the point.  The concert at Massey Hall is a Neil Young acoustical classic.  A lot of songs that were new at the time and have since become classics along with a few old favorites.    Unless you just have to have everything by Neil Young, just get the CD - you can live without the DVD.  Out of 68 minutes, a repeat of the CD, you get - if you're lucky, maybe 20 minutes of poorly photographed concert footage.  And what's the remainder?  If you're stoned and really get your jollies in watching a film of tape recorder taping the concert, you'll truly enjoy the DVD.  Yep, that's the bulk of the DVD - a tape recorder recording the concert with Neil singing in the background.  And from the looks of the surroundings, the tape recorder isn't even at Massey Hall, but probably somewhere else.    A truly great CD which belongs in the collection of every Neil Young fan.  You can live without the DVD and not miss a thing.  Take the money you'll save by purchasing just the CD sans DVD and buy another Neil Young album.
1594200823|5.0|That's a frequent question that we all have to answer, isn't it? It also sums up the nature of the \\"omnivore's dilemma\\" quite nicely....as creatures that can eat virtually anything, the dilemma can be defined as \\"what SHOULD we eat\\"?<br /><br />Author Michael Pollan sets out to find the answer to this question by tracing 4 meals back to their sources. Pollan dissects a fast food meal, a store-bought organic entree, a \\"beyond organic\\" meal produced entirely at a polyculture farm, and a meal that he hunts and gathers (almost) entirely by himself. Along the way, he asks the reader to join him in his quest for a more thorough knowledge of the food that we eat and a better understanding of how the decisions that we make as food consumers help to shape our cultural and physical landscape.<br /><br />This is an intensely interesting book, and an important addition to the bookshelf for anyone interested in becoming more \\"food-aware\\". Pollan's journey is always engaging, sometimes spiritual (\\"We are what we eat\\" takes on a new dimension when one stops to look at it with this much depth), and occasionally frightening. He is always respectful of his cast of characters, and he is willing to challenge his own preconceptions and ideas as he gathers knowledge and experience.<br /><br />Pollan's visit to the Iowa cornfields is an eye-opener. Readers will be shocked to know how much of our food economy depends on corn and corn by-products. His foray to Whole Foods is likewise enlightening, as the lines between \\"industrial\\" food and \\"organic industrial\\" begin to blur before our very eyes. His visit to Polyface Farms in Virginia is uplifting, and you can tell that Pollan was duly impressed by what he took in while visiting there. His final chapters on hunting and gathering are quite entertaining and educational, as he takes the reader on twin wild boar and wild mushroom hunts.<br /><br />This is a book that will stick with you long after you finish it. I've found myself recommending it often, lending it out a couple of times, and referring to it frequently. It's a tremendous exercise in thinking about food, and as such, it's tremendous food for thought.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who eats.t often, lending it out a couple of times, and referring to it frequently.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|I'm a huge Neal Morse fan, I think he's one of the great composers of our time. He's not going to surprise us, we expect complex dramatic symphonic arrangements and he keeps delivering the goods. I admit it, I don't pay much attention to the words and I'm not a religious guy, so the bible-thumping washes over me without affect. It doesn't bother me. I love great progressive music and Neal is a modern-day genius at providing it.<br /><br />One thing deserves special note. Mike and Randy comprise one of the best rhythm sections in the business. They mesh tightly with a muscular precision. Randy's punchy and precise playing is a awesome. His mellow tone (and brief bass solo) in Two Down One To Go is smooth and amazing. Mike is a worldclass powerhouse. Neal is lucky to have such talented players adding substance to his grand compositions.
0143036556|5.0|Diamond's in-depth analysis of why some societies failed while others succeeded, is on sound scientific footing. Examples of Easter Island, Mayas, Norse settlements in Greenland which failed, while Japan, New Guinea, Dominican Republic, Norway as examples of successes. He talks about the tools used for the analysis, like Palynology is the analysis of pollen from the older times and match it against tree species which produce such types of pollen. Another is the Tree ring dating which is known as dendrochronology (dendron=tree, chronos=time).    In almost all the cases of failures, environmental degradation was the cause. He rightly point out that living off the environmental capital is not making money. It is spending from capital. The opposite is true of Societies which succeeded. They invariably cared for the environment and focused on renewable resources.      While coming up with prescriptions for what should be done to prevent such collapses in future, he has balanced views on protecting the environment and keeping Businesses viable at the same time. He explains in  detail why some Businesses like mining do not make enough profits to care much for environment.     The New Guinea highlanders applied garbage, ash from fires, vegetation cut from fields, , rotten logs, chicken manure as mulches and fertilizer to the soil surface. They dug ditches around fields to prevent water logging.  Legume food crops that fix atmospheric nitrogen, such as beans, were rotated with other crops to maintain nitrogen levels. They constructed terraces, erected soil retention barriers, and removed excess water by vertical drains. This helped their society to survive for a long time.     Japan developed top down forest management, like in Germany. Tokugawa shoguns ruled Japan from Edo (old name for Tokyo). Japan's heavy rainfall, snow melt, frequent earthquakes, led to soil erosion, once the forest cover on the steep slopes was removed. The shoguns invoked Confucian principles to promulgate an official ideology that limited consumption. Expanding fishing efforts using larger nets and deepwater fishing.  They started marrying later and spaced babies  thru contraception, abortion, and infanticide.  Japan was also lucky to have rapid tree growth to heavy rainfall, high fallout of volcanic ash. Incas and Europeans also used top down approach to reforestation.     He invoked Malthusian theory to explain the genocide in Rwanda. Rwanda was already densely populated in the 19th century because of moderate rainfall and the altitude is too high for malaria. Agriculture is not mechanized.  Over population led to land shortage. The war with Burundi was kind of a way of wiping out the excess population.     Rafael Trujillo became a dictator of Dominican Republic in 1930 and became a superior administrator, a shrewd judge of people, a clever politician, and a ruthless ruler. He modernized the economy, infrastructure, and industries, mostly running the country as his own private business. In 1961, he was assassinated.  He was succeeded by Joaquin Balaguer in 1966. He was very ruthless and a manipulator, but worked for environment and built up the economy. While Haiti was ruled by Papa Doc Duvalier, although better educated than Trujillo, he was equally ruthless but did not have as much foresight in protecting enviromennt. It is also good fortune that Dominican Republic receives more rains than Haiti, because of mountains dividing the island..  It has thicker soil and good for agriculture.     He also cautions us in jumping to conclusions. The solution may be worst than the problem. The coolant gases used earlier in refrigerators like ammonia were toxic ones. Leakage caused problems. CFCs were hailed as the saviors when they replaced ammonia.  When cars were introduced in the early 20th century, they were noiseless and clean compared to the horse carriages with its noise and horse's urine filling the streets.
B000OCXMAE|4.0|This isn't Linkin Park's finest, but it's a start after being gone for so long.  For those who can't deal with the explicit lyrics, move on.  They're not as bad as everyone makes them out to be - they're not excessive at all.  People say \\"bad words\\" in the real world, and life goes on.<br /><br />There are more than a couple good songs on this album, but plenty of \\"filler.\\"  Listen to it at least 3 times completely through, and you should come to like it like I have.  The first time can feel pretty rough, but give it some time.<br /><br />Looking forward to more from this great group, and hopefully an improvement that can be felt by all of their fans.
B0002EXH4K|2.0|I own both the original and the remixed/remastered version.  The original is no \\"Rust in Peace\\", but it's still a pretty good album.  I give the original 4 stars.  However, the mix on the first album is perfect and the remix ruins many of the songs.  It's hard to put in technical terms, but it just doesn't sound right.  One problem is that it sounds like each instrument is playing a different song.  Things just don't \\"fit\\" anymore.  Also, the album also sounds less intense than the original.  Usually with remasters (though not always remixes), the newer version sounds heavier.  It's not all bad though.  I kind of like the new intro to \\"Sweating Bullets\\".  I prefer the original intro to \\"Captive Honour\\", but the new intro is still a somewhat interesting alternative.<br />The only other \\"remixed and remastered\\" version I've heard is \\"So Far, So Good...So What!\\".  Although people complained about that one too, I actually liked the new version.  This, however, is far worse than the original.<br />If you haven't heard the album before, then hunt down the original.  If you have it already and are a serious fan, then you should pick this version up for the \\"Crown of Worms\\" bonus track.  It's no classic, but it's pretty good and fits in well with the album.  The three demo tracks are no good, but \\"Crown of Worms\\" makes it a worthwhile purchase if you're a serious fan.
0743289684|5.0|What a transition this individual has gone through! This autobiography describes the Somalian author's early life in Mogadishu, Saudi Arabia and Nairobi, Kenya. Most of it is repressive. She was beaten routinely by her grandmother and mother. She had to do household chores while her older brother went out with his friends. She was also genitally excised (clitoris and labia removed) - the sole purpose being to inhibit sexual enjoyment. It is another way to inhibit a woman's self-development and enjoyment. While a teenager the author participated in Islamic discussion groups about the proper nature of the head-scarf - how much or how little to reveal. It would seem that the more of the self that was removed or hidden the happier were the religious extremists. At one point she was beaten by an imman and needed hospitalization. The only pretense to self-fulfillment would be in the afterlife - or perhaps the only gratification allowed was in devotion to God. Her father was absent much of her life; he was unsuccessful in trying to topple the corrupt regime in Somalia.<br /><br /> Fortunately the author learned to read and in that she found another world. Even in `trashy' novels she observed that Western woman had a role of their own, were independent and took decisions. She was shocked and titillated that they were assertive in sexual relations.<br /><br /> She decided to act on that growing assertiveness and rebelled when her father made an arranged marriage to a Somali man who loved in Canada. When taking the plane to join this man she disembarked in Germany and sought refugee status in Holland. It was there that she entered a new world. Women were free; police behaved civilly and even offered protection.<br /><br /> A door to an entirely new mode of behavior was opened. Some refugees chose to retreat into their ethnic bubble - not Ayaan. She embraced the freedoms of her new country. Her goal became to wake up the Muslim-Islamic community to its own inner repression - and to alert the Dutch and greater Western community to the `backwardness' found within Islam. It was only after 9/11 that people started listening. Within Europe there are pockets of Muslim communities where wife-beatings and honour killings are acceptable. Children are sent to Quranic schools where they are NOT taught positive Western values - like the equality of women. Instead they memorize portions of the Quran. Women are taught at a young age to be submissive and to dress conservatively. Young girls may be excised genitally. At a young age they may be coerced into an arranged marriage. If they refuse or pursue their own choices (dating) they may be killed. If they marry and do not follow their husband's will they may be beaten. The number of honour killings in Holland proves this.<br /><br /> Ayaan made a short film with Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh. It exposed the rigidness of fundamentalist Islam. For this Theo was violently killed by a Muslim religious fanatic. After Ayaan had to go in hiding. Her goal is still to expose the evil and repressiveness of this fundamentalist cult and to get refugees and immigrants to adjust to democracy and the freedoms of Western society.the Dutch and greater Western community to the `backwardness' found within Islam.

Yes you've guessed correctly, it's the Ghost Rider!<br /><br />Nicolas Cage stars in the role of Johnny Blaze who is tricked by Mephistopheles (Peter Fonda) into selling his soul to save the life of his Father. Now forced to do the Devil's bidding during the night in the form of a skeletel rider engulfed in flame, the Ghost Rider battles forces opposed to kingdom of the Evil One. However \\"owning ones' soul is not the same as owning ones' spirit.\\" This Ghost Rider has plans of his own not quite in keeping with his Master's original intent.<br /><br />Nicolas Cage does a fine job adding wit and a touch of comedy to the role, Eva Mendes is alluring as ever, Peter Fonda cuts a fine figure as Mephisopheles and it's always a pleasure to see Sam Elliot in anything.

1594481717|5.0|I can't imagine, especially if you are at mid-life, that you feel your job is really secure. You may even have a game plan for what to do should the pink slip find you. Well, if your plan included dusting off the ol' resume and going on the internet, it's time to rework the playbook. Dan Pink's book makes a compelling, albeit indirect, case for changing one's career management strategy from merely marketing transferable skills to offering a compelling and unique promise of value.    The premise of this book is that the Information Age, which was based on the Left Brain qualities of logic, sequence, and analysis, is giving way to a new Conceptual Age dominated by the simultaneous, contextual, big-picture capabilities of the right brain. In this new Conceptual Age, careers that rely most heavily on left brain capabilities are at risk of being automated, off-shored, or may simply produce outcomes that fall short of increased demand for products and services with an aesthetic and emotional appeal.     According to Pink, the key to delivering value in the Conceptual Age is to engage in  work that involves high concept or high touch abilities. High concept includes creating artistic or emotional beauty or appeal, detecting patterns or opportunities, and producing a novel synthesis of seemingly unrelated ideas. High concept includes  ability to empathize and grasp subtleties human interaction, find joy in oneself and others, and pursue purpose and meaning. High concept and high touch are right-brain directed capabilities that rely on six senses: design, story, symphony, empathy, play, and meaning.    Although Pink's book is not a career management book, the six senses seem to align well with career management using a personal branding approach; specifically:     - Design: going beyond the utility of your skill set to its significance and emotional appeal;   - Symphony: considering how your combined competencies and attributes contribute to your unique promise of value;   -Story: crafting messages to clearly communicate what you offer;   - Empathy: building a network of mutual benefit with others;   - Joy: identifying work you love where you can be yourself;   - Meaning: making a difference in the lives of the people you serve.    Of course, integrating these capabilities into managing you career is just the beginning. Increasingly, I believe, these capabilities will be the drivers for innovation and stand-out accomplishment in whatever position you have. And stand-out accomplishment demonstrates the unique and compelling value you deliver -- which, in turn, moves your career forward.    I highly recommend this book for the perspective it can provide on proactively managing your career.

B000065VA1|5.0|Luis Mejia (son)- Peter Gabriel have shown us that he can stay on the map even after quiting a band such famous as Genesis, and this album shout that on every song. This album has everything; Rock pieces like Red Rain, a song full of emotions about a dream of swimming on red water, pop songs like Sledgehammer, an incredibly famous song with a stunning music video whic won 6 prices on the MTV music awards of that time, Don't Give Up, that is also on the vocals with Kate Bush, In Your Eyes, his most famous love song, Mercy Street, Big Time, a catchy, fun and cheerful song alike with Sledgehammer; the album also contains new experimentations seen before in Security (The Family And The Fishing Net, San Jacinto) like We Do What We're Told (Milgram 37) about the famous experiment of Stanley Milgram, That Voice Again and This Is The Picture (Excellent Birds).<br /><br />It has everything and the album will be frozen in time as Peter Gabriel's best album.
B000002UB3|4.0|Abbey Road remains a bittersweet experience for most Beatles fans.<br /><br />Abbey Road reveals that the Beatles, regardless of personal turmoil and circumstances, were still making music at an incomparable level even as they were going out.  As musicians, they influenced the world around them, and did just about anything they wanted to do on a musical canvas.  They were secure financially but never complacent about their work.  They were challenged by music and in turn, challenged what could be done within their musical landscape.<br /><br />Up to this point - they'd done just about every genre of music from pop, hard rock, proto-metal, country, ballad, blues, world...Abbey Road is simply an extension of that musical adventure.  With the fragmentary song route established by the White Album - Abbey Road brought more of a focus to the band's short musical flirtations and excursions and made them work as a whole.  It often feels like the band had so much talent to spare that they could wave their fingers and write whatever they wanted.  But what the band craved was the unknown - new production methods, new experiences and styles - anything but the norm.  Abbey Road succeeds in that respect.<br /><br />The album is somewhat schizophrenic, and yet integrates as a complete experience and works better with each listening.  The first few tracks speak volumes about each Beatle's individual personalities: \\"Come Together\\" by John Lennon reveals his rock n roll activist nature; \\"Something\\" - George Harrison's quietly passionate but emerging star; \\"Octopus's Garden\\" - Ringo's playful whimsical musical personality; \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" - Paul McCartney's affection for lighthearted ditties...although I personally find the lyrics morbid in a Sweeney Todd way.  The moods and the nuances of each track speak for themselves, yet somehow playing together as the Beatles made them more brilliant than their individual talents.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part is the impressive Abbey Road suite - from Because to Sun King to The End, et al - which is really a swansong to their fans and perhaps, themselves.  What makes this just less than a 5 star album for me are the odd tracks and moments which indulge themselves rather than delight - McCartney's Silver Hammer is a throwaway and I Want You (She's So Heavy) drags on a little.  And as mentioned many times before, George Harrison's two tracks - Something & Here Comes the Sun are the album's most endearing.<br /><br />The sonic quality of the Abbey Road suite is stunning - and truly set apart the Beatles from all other bands then and now.  Abbey Road was remastered 20 years ago from 8 track and yet it sounds as vibrant as anything else that has come after it.  It's a testament to the band and George Martin for creating the soundscapes that the Beatles did (compare this to a Rolling Stones record from the same era and the differences are extreme).  This would no doubt influence later bands like Led Zeppelin and Queen.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine how any band that could've covered the amount of musical ground that the Beatles did in such a relatively short span of time.  Such is a testament to their talent.  Relistening to Abbey Road is a both an experience and as with other Beatles albums - a masterclass in music.o Sun King to The End, et al - which is really a swansong to their fans and perhaps, themselves.

B000065V9Y|4.0|Luis Mejia (son)- Although Gabriel previous album So was a great hit that spread out all of his popularity, this album is less popular but good as well. The musical style brought up to this album is not so firm as his past works, it's a deep work enjoyable and appreciatable though. It was released in 1992.<br /><br />The first track Come Talk To Me was written by Gabriel because of his distant relationship with his first daughter. The third track Blood Of Eden was previously released in the film \\"Until The End Of The World\\". The songs Steam and Digging In The Dirt are the most famous in the album, both with sensational music videos and with catchy rythms, more alike for those who like the song Sledgehammer. The song Kiss That Frog is also alike. The rest of the tracks are very nice each one and are more personal, soft and calm with strong themes.<br /><br />If you're yet not convinced, then I'll tell the great personnel that Peter Gabriel brought in this album; some of them are Tony Levin (King Crimson), Sin&eacute;ad O' Connor, Peter Hammill (Van Der Graaf Generator), Brian Eno, among others.
0743496728|4.0|This is a good book. I was expecting excellent after a few reviews, but it's still one that I will read again. It's a little long in some parts, but overall it will make you think and if a parent, make your heart ache. Though a work of fiction, for many kids this is everyday reality.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|\\"Lake House\\" didn't do well in the theaters, and that doesn't surprise me.     I saw the movie at my sister's house last Thanksgiving, and bought it just recently. Here's the theory:  The Keanu Reeves (Alex) character is killed crossing a city street in the beginning of the movie while the Sandra Bullock character (Kate) is sitting on a bench with her mother in the square, and she sees it happen. Maybe he saw from her across the street and was intrigued; maybe he had seen her somewhere before and wanted to talk to her. It's Valentine's Day 2006. After that, Alex starts communicating with her from \\"heaven,\\" with the help of God or a Guardian Angel disguised as a dog named Jack. (Jack is both of their dogs, and Jack seems to know everything). Kate then starts writing to Alex two years in the past, and the whole episode of letter exchanges \\"across time\\" from beginning to end is a process of changing history, a \\"second chance\\" for both of them.    The thing that intrigued me about \\"Lake House\\" was that at first I didn't really understand what was going on; and then I realized that it all made sense (given the premise that time travel is possible) once you realize that he got killed in the beginning of the movie in a traffic accident, and right after that she gets an answer back from him from the past in her mailbox. This is a time travel movie, but strictly speaking it is not sci-fi, maybe the genre should be called \\"romantic mysticism.\\"     Alex can't show up at the restaurant where he made a reservation for them to meet two years in advance because he is dead. For the same reason, he can't call her on the phone at the appointed time that she gives in another letter. When he meets her earlier (in 2004) at Kate's boyfriend Morgan's party, and when he picks up her lost book at the train station, we can assume that these are also changed history episodes that didn't really happen the first time around. (Then again we might assume that they did happen.) Also when he plantsthe trees in front of the big apartment building where she lives in 2006, history is changed and the full-grown trees suddenly appear. At the end of the story when she writes to tell him not to cross the street on Valentine's day 2006, the main history changing event takes place and they can finally meet in 2008 with each knowing who each other is.       I gave away the \\"plot\\" because this is the kind of movie you can enjoy much more once you know what's going on.     Good time travel movie.

0316018953|5.0|Much has been said that The Outlook began as a serial written for the New York Times Sunday Magazine.  But you know what?  None of that matters to the reader who buys a copy of the book.  The question for that reader has nothing to do with the adaptation of the serial into a novel or the constraints placed on Connelly by the serial format;  the question is how good a read is The Outlook.  The answer?  Excellent.  The novel is spare and lean.  Unlike other Connelly novels, it all takes place in the course of a 24 hour period.  There may be fewer pages, but The Outlook is not a lightweight.  Just like Harry Bosch, the plot is driven and intense.  The twists and turns are as intense and surprising as in any Connelly book.  The battle lines between bureaucracy, politics and justice, between the Feds and the LAPD, between the rule book and Bosch's code of justice are all part of the canvas upon which Connelly paints his word picture in The Outlook.  There may be less explicit introspection in The Outlook, but Bosch's raison d'etre -- that every life counts, every murder victim counts and they all deserve justice -- has never rung truer.  Michael Connelly is the best at his craft.

While the build and sound quality of the Pro HD-280 headphones is also stellar, I have to keep them mounted over a box to stretch them out when not in use, because they are so tight on my head that they give me a headache after an hour, or so, of wear.    Also, I wish they had a built-in volume control.  I have gotten used to the wireless Sennheiser's volume control, and find myself reaching for it on the HD-280s, without success.    Other than those shortcomings, I am pleased with the headphones.  It's good that I only paid $69, plus shipping for them.  Any more than that and I'd feel a bit short-changed.
B000NA2776|5.0|Life in Cartoon Motion~ Mika is an astounding pop album with stupendous lyrics and a voice to match it. This is one of the better albums that I have heard for quite some time. I must admit that I heard that song , i.e., Relax(Take it easy) before, but I did not know who it was. In fact two tracks stand out as being absolute gold and that is Grace Kelly and Relax (Take it easy). The book-let is strange mish mash of photos and cartoons and I have no idea what the artist is trying to convey with this. It sure beats me. But this is such a small blemish on such an amazing recording. This guy has vast potential and to imagine that this is his debut album. Highly recommend indeed. I can not wait for his future releases and hope that the next album will come in a year or two.
B0000931OG|3.0|Think Tank~ Blur is an ok recording of experimetal pop/rock/advantgarde music. The lyrics are way out there and the sound reminds of nothing I have heard so far. But if one asked me and I had to give an answer then it would be a bit like a mix between the cure, einsturzende and everyday pop. The book-let is a travesty and the cover looks like someone spent five minutes on a sketch and then in their infinite wisdom decided that was all the work that was needed. Not a good decision. Still do not get me wrong here. It is not a bad album at all. It is just a little odd and not in a really amazing way and therefore it gets 3 well deserved stars. Ok but nothing more.
032147404X|5.0|This is great book for everyone, beginners and advanced. Well written in plain English. Great color photos, clean layout, and a very low price.  A must have reference book. I hope Scott Kelby writes more non-Photoshop specific titles.
B0000CNY27|4.0|WHAT A GREAT CULT CLASSIC,JOHN CARPENTER MADE A ENTERTAINING ACTION FLICK,<br />EVERY ACTOR ROCKED IN THIS ONE! THIS IS ONE IS A KEEPER IN YOUR DVD COLLECTION.......OFTEN IMITATED,NEVER DUPLICATED..TIMELESS
B000PKG6TE|5.0|This album really has some awesome tracks from start to finish. The beginnging of turning on the screw is great. I wish they would of put the track 'era vulgaris' on here but I got it through my own methods. And I got to say that adds alot to this album as well. Personally, I got this home and ripped it and put it on my MP3CD with all of the other queens albums I've bought (meaning all of them) And the album blends in great with the rest of the albums on repeat.    THAT'S HOW I ROLL!  GREAT ALBUM!    BEN FRAWLEY
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is defintely one of the rare pearls that make sifting through the rest of the mindless entertainment available worthwhile. Just when you think there are no real human beings left and that the world is just a bad reality TV show, along comes a show like Firefly and it's movie version Serenity. It gives you a reason to keep the faith.<br /><br />The DVD box set is well made and packaged, the story and characters revitalizing.
0452286751|3.0|This was my first Rand book.  Having read all 700 some pages of it while doped up on vicodin and recovering from the removal of my wisdom teeth, I was able to digest it in one big, painful gulp.    I loved how Rand subtly & not-so subtly wove her philosophy into the structure of the characters and the story.  I also loved how, aside from Roark, I couldn't immediately tell who the good guys and bad guys were going to be.  Through twists and turns of the story, I kept rooting for Roark because his character was so strong while he remained soft-spoken.  I knew that no matter what happened, Roark would be victorious.  But during the trial at the end, Rand used poor little Roark as a podium to directly spews pages and pages of her bullsh*t ideas in a very direct, patronizing way which to me seemed quite contrary(not in philosophy but in personality) to Roark's character as it had been portrayed in the book up to that point.  Consequently, I became disenchanted with the only character in the book I had spent those hundreds of pages connecting with.  What a let down...
055358202X|5.0|This book was a fine read.  Those complaining about it following \\"minor\\" characters and only containing half a story seem to be upset because this book isn't what they were expecting it to be.  But Mr. Martin is the author, not any of us, and nothing about this work makes me think his quality of writing or his ability to write an engaging story is failing.         These minor characters aren't minor at all.  They all offer something in terms of their point of view and what events are going on in different parts of the world.  Something that makes ASOIAF one of the best is the enormous amount of attention Mr. Martin gives to the little details about his world.  All the back story he's developed so that, at least I, really feel this could be a real world with a rich and complex history surrounding it.         Sure, I love Davos and Jon and while Danaerys isn't my favorite character, her chapters are always interesting.  But I can accept that they weren't in this book, and focus on what the author was showing us.  I guess I'm critiquing this book as a part of the whole series, and maybe that's not a fair assessment, but to me it just seems like a normal follow-up to the intense events occuring in A Storm of Swords.  Slower yes, but I have a feeling Dance with Dragons in going to pick up.  Maybe this slower paced book is going to lead us up to that.         I am eagerly awaiting his new book, but I'm also in no real rush to finish this series.  It's a weird paradox.  I so badly want to know what's going to happen, but once it's over, it's over. I'd rather take it slow and just enjoy Mr. Martin's wonderful writing and continued character and plot development.
B000HA4WT8|4.0|The Movie was great considering it didnt have Paul Walker in it!I loved the end with an old member watch it yourself!!!!!!
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I didn't get Rihanna first cd because I wasn't feeling the whole island girl thing.  But I heard Umbrella with Jay Z and seen the video and decided to take a chance on her album.  This cd has been getting heavy roatation in my car since I bought it 2 weeks ago.    My favorites on this album are:  Umbrella  Push Up On Me  Breakin' Dishes (I LOVE THIS SONG!)  Say It  Questions Existing  Good Girl Gone Bad  Lemme Get It That    This girl's voice is nice and her cd is something you can ride to without skipping tracks!
B00003CY6M|4.0|I love this movie its a great love story that deep down would happen to all of us! C'mon guys Kate Beckinsdale shes hot!!!!!
B000GG4Y32|5.0|A wonderful film that I just never got around to before.  Everything about it was well done.  Warren Beatty should have won best actor Oscar as well as the one for director that he was awarded.  Enjoyed it a lot more than Doctor Zhivago.
B0001I562I|5.0|This is definetly a classic!! I showed my kids this & that became an instant movie to watch!
0316166685|3.0|Agonizing book about a girl who is brutally raped and murdered in the first few pages. The story is told from her looking down from heaven as she tells how her family is coping with her death.  I don't want to read about fourteen year old girls getting murdered. Geez, I can watch the evening news if that is the kind of story I want to be investing time into.      I also felt some of the character's weren't true to themselves, and the out of body experiences that occurs three fourths of the way through is bizarre and unrealistic.  I love being touched by a book, but this one I felt went to shock value emotion rather than letting you get to know the characters and feeling for them when something happens.
B00005JGAB|5.0|I WAS BORN IN 74, SO I DID NOT GET THE CHANCE TO LIVE IN THE YEARS OF `REAL`PUNK.TODAY EVERY THING IS PUNK : AVRIL LAVIGNE IS PUNK - FALL OUT BOY IS PUNK - BLINK 182 IS PUNK - EVEN WALLMART HAS A PUNK SECTION !! BUT,<br />FOR THE REAL THING, YOU HAVE TO LOOK IN THE PAST... NOTHING COMPARES TO THE RAMONES - NOTHING COMPARES TO THEIR 1ST ALBUM. IM GLAD TO SAY THAT I SAW THEM IN 96 IN VERDUN (QC). IM GLAD TO SAY THAT I GOT A RAMONES TATTOO - IM GLAD TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE BEST PUNK ALBUM EVER....... R.I.P
B000PMGS8G|3.0|I saw Sam Jones at a convention and he said he recorded commentary for a future region 1 release. And from what I understand, The \\"Savior Of The Universe Edition\\" doesn't have it. So I say, WTF?     I could care less about the artist who drew the new cover and how the movie inspired him. He has nothing to do with this movie.     How about an interview with the surviving members of Queen about the making of the soundtrack? How about including the commentary from Sam Jones and Melody Anderson. Or Max Von Sydow, who is still alive. And the writer and director. Who cares about a guy that had nothing to do with the film?    I am happy that it is remastered. But that should be a given. I own the original region DVD and would really only buy this one if it had good extras. Part of me is still hoping that might happen one day.
B000009QO6|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF DIRTIEST MOST EVIL ROCK ALBUM OF ALL TIME !!! EVERY THING IS PERFECT - FROM THE ALBUM SLEEVE TO THE RICK RUBIN PRODUCTION TO THE RIFFS & LYRICS AND DRUMS. ITS A MIXT OF OLD ACDC - WITH EVIL ELVIS ON VOCAL !! I SAW THEM IN 92, THEY HAD THE BEST DRUMMER EVER MR CHUCK BISCUIT.I WOULD SUGGEST BUYING DANZIG 2 AND DANZIG 3, ALL 3 ALBUMS ARE GOOD FROM THE 1ST TO THE LAST SONG (+ ITS ALL THE ORIGINAL MEMBERS) AFTER<br />THAT, DANZIG WENT ALL TECHNO AND I LOST INTEREST. I NEVER LEAVE HOME WITHOUT DANZIG
1400032717|4.0|This book is full of humor, sadness and mystery.  The more I read, the more I enjoyed and appreciated it.  It's an easy book to read (except for the occasional quadratic equation), and I haven't laughed out loud that much in a long time.  Highly recommended.
B000059XYK|4.0|A very pleasant surprise, Gone in 60 Seconds, is an adventure that brings to the screen the story of a former car thief who is forced back into stealing in order to save his little brother's life.  The problem is that he has to steal 50 exotic cars in only three days' time...  Nicolas Cage, Robert Duvall, Giovanni Ribisi, Angelina Jolie, Vinnie Jones, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are commendable to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows! Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.    The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor (!), and the music (!) are all wonderful!  In short, Gone in 60 Seconds is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection!  BRING ON THE SEQUEL!
B00000I8UF|5.0|I have always thought of Jazz as a part of music that always seemed tucked away in the underground. I mean, even though Musicians like Miles Davis and John Coltrane had sold millions of records, it still was without the help of FM radio play. I still believe this today, even though we have \\"light jazz\\" stations, they are nothing more then glorified elevator music. Art Blakey might not with the same populatiry of Coltrane and Davis, but he still wails, and believe me this guy in an amazing drummer. Its funny when you think of all the drummers from all different generes of music that have paved the way of rock of roll such as Neil Peart of Rush, Bonzo from Zepplin, Moon from The Who, and to the more underground drummers of Thrash/Death Metal such as Lombardo from Slayer, Flo Mourier from Cyrotopsy, and Ulrich from Metallica, but way before these drummers there were Jazz drummers who could tear the skin off the drum. Blakey is one of them. The Jazz Messengers are a tight knit group on their own, but if you are a fan of rock or metal, listen to what Blakey is doing. Sound Familer? I hear such influence epsically in Death Metal, because even though Metal uses alot of Double Bass (which Jazz typically avoids) the speed of jazz drummer is insane, sometimes even a bit faster with the way it swings then some of faster Death Metal band (does it suprise you that Flo Mourier of Cryotopsy, easily the best drummer in Death Metal, is trained with a jazz background) I cant stress enough that if you arent a jazz fan, then you should really be getting into this Music, and Blakey is a great place to start. You wont hear shredding guitar work and gutteral vocal here, but you will hear some great musical ablity that seemed light years ahead of its time. ENJOY

1569242739|5.0|My non-vegan dinner guests were shocked when they found out the cupcakes were vegan!  My kids love them!  (It's important to provide vegan children treats that actually taste good).
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Sounds almost like 2 different bands.  The first 4 songs are awesome, and absolutely blew me away!  5 stars, plus. Kinda takes you back to the glory days or Images and Words and Awake.  Then, unfortunately the last 4 songs just really don't thrill me that much.  DT definately still \\"has it\\", and I'm glad I purchased this CD, but the second half, to me, was quite disappointing.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Everyone I've shown this to from friends and family who come over to view this love it.  Even the kids and adults who I wouldn't normally think would like watching a nature documentary, which this basically is.  The animal chase scenes are well liked in particular and the time-sped footage of foliage, trees and even fungus makes the saying \\"like watching grass grow\\" be an interesting and awe-inspiring experience, especially now that it's in high definition.  The narration is good, I found myself watching the first time without subtitles to take in all the visuals and audio, and will be watching it again with subtitles on to gain added insight into what exactly I am watching.  This box set is highly recommended for owners of a Blu-ray player because you will be enjoying hours and hours of nature videography that is not seen everyday and for those who wish to share their Blu-ray/HDTV/surround sound setup, this boxset is appealing for most anyone who visits.
1582701709|2.0|I bought this Book on my way back to Alabama on April 15th of this year. Quite interesting book. The ideas are not that new to me. Some are even borrowed from the Bible itself. A few from the Qur'an I might add. I am a bit skeptical about the claims which she says, for instance, \\"if you keep on thinking I am going to receive a paycheck in the amil today, soon or later its going to happen\\". To me thats plain stupid. And I believe some people would buy into it literally. I would recommend this book more as an idealogy. How to carry yourself in life oppose to taking it seriously word for word. All those people who cam on stating they were cured from illnesses are make belief in my opinion. I remember not to long before my trip to Alabama I saw a nighttime or primetime special on ABC, and one the coaches just made a FOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL of himself. Whether he was under pressure or not really took away from the book's credibility. But good a read
1594489505|4.0|Americans are so weary of war in the Middle East that we page past the headlines of IEDs as if the words themselves might at any minute blow.  What then could make us read--for pleasure--a story about the brutalities of living in Afghanistan? A writer skilled in telling about the unrelentingly harsh lives of ordinary people and the extents to which they will go to live just a little more,hoping to grasp a scrap of happiness. That writer is Khaled Hosseini, and he has taken us to that alien land not once but twice, first with The Kite Runner and now with A Thousand Splendid Suns. If anything, the latter is the better book.<br /><br />As in The Kite Runner, Hosseini is gripped by the class differences in Afghanistan, and how those accidents of birth set lives on different courses. In A Thousand Splendid Suns, another accident of birth, being born a female, compounds the cruelties of class.<br /><br />Hosseini is uncomfortable that he finds himself in the role of reporter; as our source for information on a country we so little understand. Yet, he brings a dimensionality to a cardboard country we might otherwise ignore, except for the unavoidable images on the nightly news. It is his loving look at the humanity of common people struggling against the all to common inhumanity they encounter every day that begins to redeem a society we before had little reason to even consider.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns is difficult to read because of the brutal lives the women read, yet once you start, it is impossible not to.

0440238609|5.0|There definitely are some more sophisticated themes and adventures to be experienced in these books.  I'd say it's probably best for 5th graders and higher, not so much for the lower elementary crowd.  I will say though that I don't think it would necessarily be traumatic for a younger child to read this series, I have heard of a number of children in the 8 yr old age group that love having this trilogy read to them.    For my husband and I, as we are avid fantasy/sci readers, it was a fantastic read that we both enjoyed enormously.  Children and adults alike would love these books.  Very well written, exciting, original, and - as if the first three weren't enough - it manages to effortlessly, in the most non-contrived, non preachy way, offer up a world of philosophical ideas to grapple with.    A truly wonderful read, definitely part of our relatively recent \\"Golden Age\\" of fantasy/sci fi literature.
0593055063|2.0|*** spolier warning - I try to keep details out, but in case ... ***    The biggest flaw on the plot:  1,- Why would the boss send the boyfriend of his colleague who had never worked for him to Spain on a mission? Is absurd that a US agency sends a literature professor on a deadly mission. The book goes on and on discribing this useless persecussion across Spain.  2,- If I want password from someone, wouldn't I first check if it works before killing him?    Innacuracies, yes Dan Brown has never touched a computer:  1,- One can not open a software (or virus-worm) and read its content if it is in a binary state (bits and bytes). Actually, if one manages to do reverse engineer (open the black box) then one would be able to stop it by knowing how it is operating.  2,- Anonymous servers can not be \\"traced\\" to find an email originator - they are separate machines that act like operators sending mesagges around. The only solution is for the Anonymous server to disclose the name of the person signing the message.  3,- Computer Viruses are not killed by an \\"andtidote\\" but by an anti-virus.   4,- A worm is not more harmful than a virus. A worm replicates to spread, in the story it is more of a Trojan Horse than a worm.  5,- QuickTime is not used for \\"satellite link\\" video conference, any teenager downloading video knows that. Apple should sue, just for the author's ignorance.    Dan Brown will keep you awake but is a pitty he sucks at research.
B000MQC9H4|4.0|A great sweet movie.  One that I will watch again and again.  Jude Law is wonderful as a romantic lead as is Cameron Diaz.  I loved Jack Black. He is always funny and a joy to watch. I would love to see the outtakes of this movie! They have got to be great!  Kate Winslet was a surprise and is very funny in this movie!
B000HL09SA|1.0|Very strange storyline and abrupt pointless ending..AVOID this if you have dog loving kids aged 10 or less.
1594489505|5.0|Wow.  What an incredibly powerful read.  The empathy that you feel for the characters is all consuming.  I didn't think it would be possible, but I believe this even surpasses The Kite Runner.  I've never cried so much reading a book before in my life.  Highly, highly recommended.
B000A6T1HC|4.0|Just like Farinelli was the opera phenomenon of his time, fast-forward to the 21st century, Bartoli gives once again this music of the Italian settecento a breath of new life in all its splendor and glory.<br /><br />In Opera Proibita, Bartoli's repertoire not only reflects on her as a consummate vocal artist but also as the ultimate scholar. Rarely an opera singer would dig this dip and go that far to unearth great scores from total obscurity. Even more uncommonly a singer would take the challenge of singing these arias without the risk of ridiculing herself, but to the contrary establishing a new record and precedent.<br /><br />Her execution of the Handel arias is truly astonishing in coloratura and melismas probably not heard for three hundred years when only the best castrati commanded the virtuosity to tackle these arias. Also surprising and refreshing was to hear works by Handel that show his wild side.<br /><br />Bartoli brings this album to a high climax with the arias from Il Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno. This is really her realm and true medium. Her vocal runs in \\"Un pensiero nemico di face\\" sound like a first violin, and as if this was not difficult enough she ornaments the da capo melismas in tempo from allegro to presto molto vivace, and transitions into a note crescendo with great ease and certainty.  Wonderful!
B00000IACG|5.0|I think anyone who has ever been in a band would agree that often the most interesting musical ideas occur in practice. There are always little snippets of things; ideas that, for various reasons, sometimes just don't work when they are attempted to be developed further into full songs. Of course, most of these \\"ideas\\" are dropped, forgotten, and the band moves on. Often, no one outside the group ever even hears these things. It usually isn't even recorded. Makes sense. Most people want fully developed songs and satisfying conclusions. Still ... there is something lost in these little tidbits. The idea for using these kind of fragments for a film soundtrack is just brilliant! Especially with a band of Fugazi's caliber. \\"Instrument\\" (the documentary) is an art film in the best sense of the term. The pure combination of images and music is absolutely beautiful. There are some traditional songs on here and some songs that evolved into other things. I just really like the instrumental bits. My favorite regular song is \\"Little Debbie\\". It just rocks like hell! I can't really make out the lyrics, but it sounds like Ian is yelling, \\"Starbucks! Starbucks! Oh Yeah! Do the funky strut! I'm Crazy!\\" (I hope that's what he's saying! Ha.) Anyway, I love this whole album. It's not your standard Fugazi record. Listen to it with fresh ears and I think you'll be rewarded.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Writer Shane Black has always crafted stories that may be a little too quirky and over-the-top for the mass audience, but I love his love for film and talent for dialogue which are on display in his directorial debut.    After a botched robbery, the RDJ character stumbles into a film audition, which leads to an LA oddessey. In the course of it, bullets, dead bodies and a severed finger start to pile up, as the case turns into a cheap detective novel - not unlike the kind the characters riff about in the movie.    I found \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang\\" to be a real treat for cinema-philes who like smart characters and a bit of the \\"breaking the fourth wall\\" feel. Admittedly, the plot is a little loose, and really only exists to facilitate the action (Noires sometimes have plot issues - see The Big Sleep & Night Moves for examples - so many twists). The movie takes itself just seriously enough to be wild but coherent. The \\"LA flare\\" and the fact that the actors seem to be having so much fun made this a fun view for me. RDJ & Val Kilmer (who steals a few scenes of his own) are great together, and Michelle Monaghan was witty, fun and nice to look at. This is the kind of fun film experience I enjoy & miss in the garbage they churn out in Hollywood now - really dug it.
1559408855|2.0|sadism and perversion doesn't mean anything if the victims just don't react.For example If ANYone were to eat excement they WILL gag.But they Don't....This film couldn't really hold my attention at all.I couldn't believe in the film and i'm suprised at many of these reviews reading so many metaphors into it.Without reading up on the film (that is not being told what to read into it)I figured it was an indictment of facism and the cold callous cruely of the holocaust came to mind.But poignant metaphors throughout?-give me a break.And how can it be perverse or sadistic if the kids keep failing to mind?
B000PFUAO6|3.0|...these lyrics leave a great deal to be desired.  Musically, the boys continue to astound, and Labrie is a powerful, talented vocalist.  I'm just starting to get tired of the hackneyed, pseudo-religious lyrics.  Some people can write great lyrics that people can relate to, some can't.  I get \\"the point\\" of each of their songs, and every so often, I find the points they are making to be interesting, and thoughtfully expressed.  Unfortunately, those moments are few and far between.  I caught myself unconsciously rolling my eyes the other day in my car while listening to the new lyrics.  With each new DT album, I now find myself doing the same thing I do with each new Steve Vai album: fast-forwarding through the lyrics to get to the instrumental parts.  Not a good thing.
B000PFUAO6|4.0|Huge DT fan here.  I've taken time to read some of the reviews, and I'll agree that is difficult for many of DT following to objectively listen to and review one of the most complex and fascinating bands of the past 15 years, but I'll give it my best shot here.    To begin with, I must say that I have very mixed feelings for the album after listening to it through about 10 or so times.  Upon first listen (and I still have yet to lose my taste for it), I felt that In The Presence of Enemies was a stellar opening, a sort of song that I wanted to (and expected) to hear.  I especially enjoy the Petrucci semi-solo spot at 2:10 in the song, it's good to hear that on top of being able to play blazing fast (it seems that John a little flight of the bumble bees a few seconds before this part) they can still carry a very intriguing melody that sort of makes you feel weightless in a way.  It's certainly one of the finer parts of the album in my opinion.    After listening to ITPoE Pt. 1, I had huge expectations for the rest of the album, assuming that it was going to be as good as the initial song.  Probably a bad idea, as the last couple of albums have proved this assumption incorrectly.  I won't say that Forsaken was a terrible song (It's really difficult to say that any DT song is downright terrible), but it just doesn't seem to be DT at it's full potential.  As many reviewers have pointed out, there seems to be a bit of cheesiness to it.  \\"Forsaken, I have come for you, tonight..\\"  I don't know, the lyrics are seriously lacking in this song, as they are with a couple of other songs in the album.  I hate to say it, but each time I listen to the album, I find myself wanting to skip this song more and more each time I hear it.  Constant Motion does have a bit of a Metallica edge to it.  It's entertaining, but it does seem to get old, and they've been continuing that trend since they did Glass Prison on Six Degrees.    A bit of the cheesiness pops up again in The Dark EternalNight, though it is heavily outweighed by the excellent instrumentation.  I personally think this song to be one of the finer points in the album (with the exception of ITPoE Pt.1)    The rest of the songs (except Ministry of Lost Souls) seem to be subpar for DT.  Prophets of War just reminds me of how much DT should stay away from politics.  The Great Debate is (imho) the only exceptionally good political song that they have pulled off to date.  Also, the song reminds me very much of Muse...which is really not a good thing.  Very much respect to Muse for doing their thing, but DT needs to not emulate it.    The final song is not as good at Pt 1, and does have a bit of cheesiness to it, though the same amazing theme in Pt 1 shows up again.    As critical as the review may sound, one cannot take anything away from the musicianship that they have.  They still seem to have that touch, and still play extremely tight.  I do personally thing this album is a step up from Octavarium, but not by much (simply because of the epic title track Octavarium, 24 minutes of perfection).  On top of that, I don't think it matches up to Six Degrees, or Metropolis, or even Train of Thought for that matter.  After the tour, I think they should consider taking a longer break, taking their time to refresh their minds for any upcoming albums they plan to make.  As much as I hate to say it, I feel that the \\"magic touch\\" from Metropolis and Six Degrees has escaped the band.  Again, the musicianship is still there, but I just can't take the songs quite as seriously as before.    Long story short, something is missing in the band that I fear they will never be able to obtain again.  I will be seeing them in a couple of months, I hope their live performance can convince me that they do indeed still have that \\"magic touch\\".    4 stars.
B000003TAR|5.0|\\"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times\\".  This quote from Charles Dickens and A Tale of Two Cities seems to describe the confusion and contradiction to Nirvana's In Utero.  This was their third studio album and second after the breakthough of Nevermind.  In Utero ranges from radio rock hits such as Heart Shaped Box, All Apologies, and Rape Me, to songs that purposely challenged and even attempted to scare away an audience such as Milk IT, Tourette's, and Scentless Apprentice.  The album also contains songs that might point to where Nirvana was heading in the future, such as the cello backed Dumb and the Folk/rock opening of Pennyroyal Tea.  This is not the album for those who just liked the polished songs of Nevermind, but for those who wish to see the full range of Nirvana.  This is Nirvana in transition, stuck between rebelling against their quick rise to success, yet still sticking with the famous pop/rock formula which made them famous, and experimenting at the same time.  The result was a number one album that has gone on to sell over 5 million copies and is considered Nirvana's finest work by many fans.  My only regret with this album is the production work.  I am glad that Heart Shaped Box, All Apoligies, and Pennyroyal Tea were remixed by Scott Litt.  Originally the band was considering Andy Wallce....I wonder what this album would have sounded like had he been chosen.  Overall, this album deserves a 5 for the classic songs and Cobain's willingness to stay close to his musical beliefs.  Once again, Cobain's intense passion is shown in all of the music which was always his defining point.
B000O178BY|5.0|There are few artists who consistently make GOOD work on each of the albums that they put out.  Arguably speaking, Trent Reznor is one of those artists.  The man is criticized for \\"changing the style of Nine Inch Nails\\" and not being able to make an album to \\"match up to The Downward Spiral or Pretty Hate Machine\\".  Perhaps the albums to proceed these two masterpieces did not strike the listener as much as TDS or PHM did, but they had hidden gems within themselves.  Though they may not have been AS accessible, one would truly appreciate Reznor's work after carefully listening to the album and giving it a chance.    Now that the introduction is out of the way, I must say this is indeed a stellar album.  When it comes to Reznor's work, I strive very much to not compare any of the albums with each other (I believe With Teeth had it's own high points).  Upon first listen to this album, a couple of words came to mind.  COMPOSED CHAOS.  Hyperpower! is an explosion that honestly came unexpectedly (though I knew he would do something considerably different than With Teeth in Year Zero).  The following track seems to have a bit of the With Teeth sound, though not quite.  Though not one of my personal favorites, it's a nice way to start off the album (excluding Hyperpower! of course).  A good single in Survivalism, it seemed to be the natural first single off the album.  Slowing down the pace slightly in The Good Soldier, which is quickly becoming one of my personal favorites.  Vessel is not quite as good as the others, but it is perfectly placed in between two of my favorite tracks on the album.  Me, I'm Not is just great.  I love the slower approach by Reznor, a great pace for the story he is unfolding in Year Zero.    Notables after this include Capital G (the 2nd single off the album), My Violent Heart, God Given (my personal favorite), In This Twilight and Zero-Sum.  However, I believe this is an album that is best heard in its entirety, as you will feel (well, at leastI did) extremely satisfied after hearing it and letting yourself digest it to the point that you will be hooked.  Yes, there aren't any songs that uniquely identify the album (Like Head Like A Hole for PHM, Closer for TDS, etc.), but as a completely whole, this album is extremely solid, and quite enjoyable too for that matter.    I'm looking foward to Trent's follow up album, but until then, I'll savor the fact that he made a superior album in Year Zero.
B00006V9A0|4.0|Not a perfect album with song choices, but a good collection of most of Nirvana's hits.  A few problems I have with this album:  1.  Their first single Love Buzz is not included here.  2.  The Unplugged version of All Apoligies is used instead of the In Utero version which is the one which reached number one of Billboard's Modern Rock charts.  While not perfect, this album does do the job of collecting most of Nirvana's hits, including You Know Your Right.  This may be a great place for new fans to start or for the casual listener who just wants most of the hits.  However, I recommend that if you get into Nirvana to also buy their studio albums as well to get a full sense of this band.
B000P6R6X8|1.0|The most pointless record of the year.<br /><br />Jeff Tweedy and his Wilco have managed to make the dullest record of their career with Sky Blue Sky. Its instrumentation is as bland as elevator music, and its lyrics are as infantile as a middle schooler's book of so-called \\"poems\\" (and good lord do I wish the preceding were hyperbole).<br /><br />Since 1999's \\"Summerteeth,\\" Tweedy has frustrated and befuddled old fans of Uncle Tupelo and his new band's first pair of stellar albums (\\"A.M.\\" and \\"Being There\\") by striking off in new musical directions with every record. This consternation was always tempered, though, by the fact that the directions in which Tweedy took the band were interesting, particularly in the case of \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,\\" his first foray into his own brand of \\"progressive electronica,\\" to suggest a category. But the one adjective that can't be used to describe \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is 'interesting.' This album is interesting's absolute antithesis. Searching for days for the right descriptors for Tweedy's latest effort led this reviewer back to a small stable of terms: \\"directionless\\", \\"uninspired\\", \\"pointless\\", \\"inoffensive\\". It is the last of these I've settled on most comfortably. \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" is not a terrible album, it's just immensely disappointing. Its songs blend together in a bland soup of sound, Tweedy's vocals sound as though he's moments from slumber, and the instrumentation is derivative at best.<br /><br />Gone are all the things that once made Wilco a fantastic band to listen to: the enthusiastic energy of \\"A.M.\\" and \\"Summerteeth,\\" the sublimity of \\"Being There\\" (\\"the first alt-country masterpiece,\\" as I believe No Depression Magazine put it), the historicity and collaborative spirit of the \\"Mermaid Avenue\\" records, and the compelling sonic experimentation of \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\\" With \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" Jeff Tweedy and his band achieve the acme of boredom, a greater musical sin than any other I can imagine.<br /><br />Others have lamented that this record is too much a \\"regression\\" to the days of \\"A.M.\\" and \\"Being There.\\" If only this were true! Any sensible Wilco fan would regard a genuine return to 1994-98 stylings to be a triumph (who among us would be displeased with more work like \\"I Must Be High\\" or \\"Pick Up The Change\\" or \\"Sunken Treasure\\"?). Sadly, \\"Sky Blue Sky\\"--even in its best moments--is the palest imitation of such work. It's flat.<br /><br />Go back and listen to A.M. instead. Or better yet, pick up Son Volt's new album, \\"The Search.\\" *There* is an interesting record.ch a \\"regression\\" to the days of \\"A.M.\\" and \\"Being There.\\" If only this were true!

B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind was recently chosen by the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the 200 Definitive Rock albums of history.  It certainly deserves this status.  I was a teenager when this album was released and it certainly changed my life.  The power, passion, angst, and emotion of the songs is what made it work for me and millions of other young people worldwide.  As a teacher today I continue to see younger people influenced by this album and band.  Forget the fact that it has sold 24 million copies worldwide and was chosen by the Library of Congress to be preserved for all time, this is an album that has passion and energy and will be a classic for a long time to come.  From the classics such as Smells Like Teen Spirit, Come As You Are, Lithium and In Bloom...to other lesser known songs such as Drain You, On A Plain,. and Polly....this is an album that has to be in everyone's rock collection.  For those who say this album is overated......compared to what?  Music is very subjective.  Nirvana were not Gods and they certainly were not perfect, but they helped to change the music industry and provide music that continues to inspire and influence people today.

0205313426|5.0|This is a book which teaches how to write in a clear, concise way. It teaches how to communicate most effectively one's meaning. It is a standard guide which means it can help in standard writing only. Professor Strunk at Cornell and his pupil E.B. White( Who revised and expanded his teacher's work decades after first being acquainted with it)  have a clear approach on how to write correctly. But such advice cannot really be of major help to those who are interested in writing as art. Consider the styles of Joyce, of Kafka, of Kierkegaard, of Henry James and see how small these rules appear before the ambiguities, repetitions, digressions, indirections of these great masters.<br />This small work has been of great help and will be of great help to many- but not on the highest level of writing as Art.
B000654YRY|5.0|If you're a Dire Straits and/or Mark Knopfler fan...it's a must have.
B000NY17J6|5.0|Both of Linda's massive selling GREATEST HITS Lps have been released on one CD. This nice UK import is also nicely priced and contains some of Ronstadts best known songs. Like Connie Francis before her, Linda delved into reviving oldies and finding a formula that worked for her that would eventually lead her to branching out into other unexplored musical areas that make her a premier vocalist of her era and all time. Some of the more interesting cuts are the lesser known ones LOVE HAS NO PRIDE has the angst without resorting to cliche or soap opera. Her version of DESPERADO far exceeds the Eagles original cover. Then there are the great hits, YOU'RE NO GOOD, BLUE BAYOU and so many others.<br /><br />A great 2 for 1 by the only female rocker of her era to \\"hold it together\\" as none equalled or surpassed her in her heyday.<br /><br />Great nostalgia and a nice primer to search for her more adventurous works that she dabbled with on her Lps that listeners will be enticed to explore.<br /><br />Terrific!
B000002N25|5.0|This is a really fine CD.  I'm a big fan of both Mark Knopfler and Dire Straits.  This CD, in my opinion, is one of the best of Mark Knopfler.  Favorites of mine on this CD are Imelda, Golden Heart, Vic and Ray, and Rudiger.  The songs on this CD are more moody, reminiscent of \\"You and your friend\\", \\"Fade to black\\" off the \\"Brothers in arms\\" CD.
B000002AT6|4.0|I absolutely love James Horner and his works, and I was not at all surprised when I listened to this stunning soundtrack.  The soundtrack brings peaceul serenity of the wilderness along with the sudden unpredictability of human character (in this case Tristan's).  It won't lull you to sleep so easily, but I am certain that is exactly what Horner wants- he doesn't want a lullaby but a soundtrack to describe the feelings, and the days of the characters who live the music.  Like the soundtracks of \\"Titanic\\", \\"Swing Kids\\", \\"The New World\\", and \\"Troy\\", the music will take you to another time, and mutes out the sound of traffic, and noise of this busy present day, to bring you near to the heart of the past and it's tumultuous times that seem all more beautiful than what we experience today.  For the regular people who are certain this music should only be confined to stuffy elderly people wanting a nap, prepare to be proved wrong as a teenager wrote this.  I highly encourage you to if not buy, at least listen to this music.    -s.budgeon
B00006J3T4|5.0|I really like Mark Knopfler, I think he's one of, if not \\"the\\" best guitar players today.  I know there's alot of people who said that before I did.  He has a unique \\"Blues-y\\" vocal quality.   This is typical for Mark Knopfler, never a bad CD.  This is not my favorite CD of his but it has more than enough of what I like about his music to make it a must-have for Knopfler fans.  For me, the import version would not be worth the doubled price for the reason that I have all his CD's and DVD's and the extras are found on other cd's.  If you don't have the Sailing To Philadelphia\\" CD, buy the import, it's worth it for even that one song.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|A delightful, easy listening CD that will appeal to anyone who is a fan of Celtic music.
B000LC4TJ0|5.0|Maybe because I'm a newer devotee of opera than others, but I found this Figaro to be interesting.  The singers are all wonderful.  I suppose if I had been used to another version, I might not like this one, but for those who love Ms. Netrebko, I think you'll like this as well.<br /><br />Here is a sample of some of the critics reviews: This new, excitingly original production of Mozart's most popular opera was the sensation of the 2006 Salzburg festival.  \\"What young director Claus Guth has made of Figaro - with Harnoncourt's active collaboration - is genius... The stellar cast performed with power and precision... This Figaro is as dangerous as the midday sun in one's eyes\\" (Le Monde).  \\"A triumph for Mozart... Netrebko's golden radiance and dark velvet are ideal\\" (Salzburger Nachrichten). \\"Shatterting, unforgettable\\" (The Guardian).  Bloomberg echoed the positive accolades: \\"This Marriage of Figaro should go down in history as departing director Peter Ruzicka's greatest Salzburg achievement . . . four hours of perfection.\\"<br /><br />Here is one last review I came across: \\"The acting is a lot subtler -- more filmlike, if you will -- in a 2006 Salzburg Festival staging of Mozart's \\"Le Nozze di Figaro\\" (Deutsche Grammophon 00440 073 4245), but director Claus Guth's angst-filled deconstruction packs a wallop just the same. Reimagined as a study of marital dysfunction, this \\"Figaro\\" evokes the deep well of sadness and ripple of forlorn comedy found in the best films of Ingmar Bergman (an influence Guth cites in a documentary on the DVD). Those who like Mozart for his surface froth will hate this production. Those seeking a revelatory evening of theater that taps the score's melancholy undercurrents -- shot by video-director Brian Large to communicate a palpable sense of live stage-performance -- will find themselves haunted by Guth's vision.<br /><br />All the production elements are cut from the same cloth -- Christian Schmidt's peeling, hospital-white sets and elegantly straitjacketing 1920s costumes; Nikolaus Harnoncourt's probing, expansively paced conducting; and, not least, the casting of some dramatically compelling singers. If focus most consistently rests on Anna Netrebko's Susanna and Dorothea Roschmann's Countess, credit is due not only to their ravishing voices and canny acting but also to Guth's eye-opening decision to have both characters actually carrying on the sexual affairs they're accused of having. Bo Skovhus's Count, too, emerges as a fascinatingly conflicted character -- sheepish when not bullying, hormone-driven yet visibly nauseous over his infidelities. Nothing is taken for granted about these characters; all are conceived with a fresh eye and a sharp theatrical instinct.\\"g 1920s costumes; Nikolaus Harnoncourt's probing, expansively paced conducting; and, not least, the casting of some dramatically compelling singers.

0345350472|4.0|Androids takes place in a not-so-distant future where a world war has spread a cloud of radioactive dust across the globe, many forms of animal species are extinct, many of the survivors have emigrated to colonies on Mars and the remaining humans are encouraged to emigrate, except for those who have been tested and classified as \\"specials\\" meaning the ones with diminished mental abilities because they have been affected severely from radiation. Emigrants are given androids, very sophisticated robots, as slaves. As the technology gets better, newly manufactured androids become more and more human-like, both in appearance and behavior, to the point that they are very hard to distinguish. Discontented androids sometimes kill their masters and find ways to smuggle themselves to earth, in hopes for a better life. In the post-world war earth, life is regarded so precious that owning and caring for an animal is both considered a highly moral life and a status symbol. Because real animals are so rare, many people have fake, very sophisticated and real-like electronic animals that they care for and hide from their neighbors the fact that their animal is fake. On the one hand there are bounty hunters who catch and kill androids, human robots which dreamt of a better life, evidently with some feelings. And on the other hand there is the value which people place upon animal robots. On the one hand there are intelligent, sophisticated androids like the one who made a successful carrier on earth as an opera singer; on the other hand there are hunters who emotionlessly kill her without regard to her artistic talent, or there are simple-minded specials. Throughout the plot, readers are given a lot to think about questions like what is life, what is empathy, where do you draw a line between the value of real and artificial life? It is a philosophical novel and the author puts all these questions before us with brilliant comparisons between characters. The only negative feeling thatone might get is the unusual, somewhat simple prose style but overall, a very good, thought provoking novel.
0066620996|5.0|I bought this book as a wife of a corporate executive with the intention of at least sounding like I was knowledgeable in the corporate world.  I am happy to say after reading it; I can definitely hold my own. Even for the inexperienced, this is a very easy book to understand and gain knowledge. I especially like how he compares and gives examples so you really gain a thorough depiction of his data.  It makes it that much easier to recall when the area under discussion arises-- as it has several times after reading the book.
B000P46QIG|5.0|Many thanks to Planet X for another ride in their universe of very different and interesting music. This album is a breath of fresh air. I own all of PX albums and I follow them since their first output \\"Universe\\". I find this as one of the most focused efforts of theirs. First of all I prefer Garsed to Macalpine on the guitar chair. I think Brett fits better this kind of \\"alien\\" music even if Tony played very well on the other releases from the band. Rumors are that for the next chapter the band will have Greg Howe on board. I hope it could be true because Greg is probably the biggest gun in these territories. Holdsworth plays here just a couple of solos, they are nice but don't change the overall feel of the music ... Brett contributes a lot more. What you can find here are a lot of dispair times at the point that sometimes you lose the guys. It is very funny and interesting. If you are a musician you have a lot to think about here rhytmically. If you are not, don't worry because the music is really entertaining if you love this style (metal plus fusion I may say). I really appreciate Virgil Donati's drumming. Sometimes I find myself focusing on his playing and wow, I have to say that he's incredible. I hope this band will release more albums in this area ... I think it is something new and that this style has the potentials to be something even more interesting in the future. But this Quantum is already a very nice album that I find myself listening over and over. Even better than Moonbabies if you want. Bravo to the guys, Brett and Virgil in particular.
1569242739|5.0|I was so excited to get this book six months ago, and my excitement hasn't waned. It is my goal to make every cupcake in this book. So far, the Dulce Sin Leche and the Cookies And Cream ones have been the best! Everyone has been blown away by most of these cupcakes, especially non-vegans! It is the best way to win over those meat-eaters ;)     However, I do want to mention that some of the recipes need editing. I found inaccuracies such as listing an ingredient, but not mentioning in the directions where or when to add it. Also, one recipe (I think it was the lemon macadamia) seemed to have gotten a blueberry sauce mistakenly added to the directions! I found the mint extract in one recipe to be way too strong/much.     As an experienced cook, I have been able to figure these things out, but just keep your eyes peeled! This is still an amazing book that has brought me back to my childhood - with perhaps fluffier and better tasting ones even than the homemade ones I had! (sorry Mum and Dad!). The ideas and combinations are incredible, and the directions are funny and simple. Another delicious cookbook every vegan should own!
B000001FKY|4.0|Everything down to the last guitar note on this classic 20 year old release was recorded to perfection. I believe that is what makes this record flawed. As it turns out, over-production may be the only thing that is wrong with Hysteria.        12 tracks and pretty much no filler. Great album rock songs such as Women, Rocket, and Gods of War. Pop hits such as Love Bites and Pour Some Sugar on Me. 7 MTV hits! That was and still is unheard of. I once read that there was also an 8th video that was for the song Love and Affection that was scrapped by the band. Back in the late 80s most bands released the rocker as the first single and most of the time did well with that. The Ballad was second and a lot of the time became an even bigger hit and if you were lucky you'd be able to release another single/video and that was pretty much it and you'd record your next record and start that process again. That formula worked very well for band in the same genre such as Motley Crew, Bon Jovi, Poison, and White Lion.        With Hysteria, Def Leppard totally ruled from about late '87 to about early '90. Almost all of my early teen years are bookended by this record. Looking back now almost 20 years later, the only thing I would change would have been the production, that today sounds dated. Even with that said, this record is a monster and if you were not one of the 20 or so million that bought it, it would not be a bad investment.
0385522401|4.0|Doesn't have the fullness of a novel, but this is a beautifully written story, gripping, interesting, touching.  Didn't care for the fast forward in the last 10 pages.  Good exercise for creative writing classes--write a different ending.

Update:    This record sucks.    2nd Update (3 months later)    This record STILL sucks.
B0002BO0AS|5.0|I definitely hate the way the rythm and speed constantly change as if the band did'nt know what they were doing,but after afew listens,I became more and more impressed. This album is just great. If you're not use to the Metalcore sound,give it time. You'll learn to love this messy masterpiece...Although \\"Bloodlust\\" is pretty organized. Stand-out tracks for me: Bloodlust of The Human Condition,This Lying World,Endless and Predetermined Sky. Great sh*t,man.
0714843377|5.0|I love that most reviewers give this book either five stars or just one. That fits with the book's philosophy; Arden urges readers to take risks and produce works that some people will love and others will hate.<br /><br />\\"It's not how good you are...\\" is small and short but brilliantly crafted. The ideas inside are simple but inspiring. Its insights apply to advertising and to life in general.<br /><br />I love this book not just for what it says, but how it says it it.<br /><br />I even love the way the paper smells.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|I have been a Scorpions fan since their World Wide Live and followed closely their career during 80's and 90's. To be honest I didn't liked their last records (Pure Instinct, Unbreakable, Eye2Eye) as much as their previous albums, they were too much experimental or not adding anything new to their career.    With Humanity Hour 1, they offer the best of both worlds: first, they return to their classic sound but still innovating and not repeating old formulas. The tracks are all linked to a single theme (\\"a la Operation:Mindcrime\\") and even when they are secuenced in concept, each song is strong and has its own personality. Hard to find a weak song in the record, I specially liked \\"Love will keep us alive\\" and \\"Future Never Dies\\" a couple of interesting songs, and 321, the next Scorpions anthem that reaches the energy of \\"Hit Between the Eyes\\". The ballads don't fall in the excess of sugar like the \\"You and I\\" and the riffs in each song are just great.    For those who feared that Scorpions career was close to the end, they are back and stronger than ever. This records reivindicates the classic metal and gives hope for the future.
0340752122|4.0|Written by an English anthropologist about her own nation's behaviour.  There're some interesting explanation on why British ppl are so uneasy socializing, talking about money and may sometimes talking in the opp way (hypocrisy).  While many of the explanations suggested by the author are convincing, I found those behaviour not unique to the British, they can be observed in our Chi society as well!  So it's useful in understdg ppl's behaviour.
0451205766|4.0|The strength of this book is Puzo's expertise and knowledge of the mafia.  It makes the plot, events and the characters in the book seem extremely real. I would describe this book as a historical fiction of the mafia.    This is definitely a book that will fly by and one that you will have a hard time putting down.  It is definitely a classic. It is a book that when you finish you will close it and say, \\"Now that was a good book!\\"     In the book you will be introduced to one of the most famous families in all literature. The Corleaone family of New York.  You will learn how the family got its start in organized crime and how the family operates. You will also learn about the honor and respect it takes to work for and be a part of the family.  And, of course, you will learn what happens when you cross ways with the family.    There were only two things that I did not like. First of all, I thought there was a lot of pointless sex irrelevant to the plot. I thought it was a little over-the-top and I just got tired of it after a while.   The other thing I did not like was the location change to Las Vegas.  I thought that it was unnecessary, a distraction and took away from the real story. Having that been said I thought the whole book was exciting and there was never a part in the book, like most, where there was a lull in the action.      This is definitely a book worth the money and time spent reading. If you do not like books with graphic violence, sex and drugs then perhaps you should read something else.  If this does not bother you then you will find this book extremely exciting. Personally I would recommend buying a hardback copy of the book and putting it on your shelf with your collection of other great novels.

We find them, we take them down and then we piss on their ancestor's graves.\\"<br /><br />And they do. You know they will and the fun of these novels is seeing how it comes about with all of the odds being stacked against him and with unexpected twists and turns occuring in the story line.<br /><br />Reacher and nine of his friends had been special investigators for the Army Military Police when they were in the service. Now all on their own, they are drawn back together to find out who is bent on killing some of them and why.<br /><br />That's really all you need to know. It's Jack Reacher.

1400063515|2.0|There is a lot to be said about the impact of highly improbable events.  Unfortunately, there isn't enought to be said in order to fill a book.     After Fooled By Randomness I was looking forward to The Black Swan.  But it's clear by page 50 that Taleb is padding his prose in order to produce something book-length.  That's sad because it eventually waters down a fine idea worthy of discussion.    The Black Swan is yet another example of good article length concepts that a publisher thinks will make a good book.  However, the author doesn't have a heck of a lot more to say than what could be easily fit inside the pages of Esquire or Vanity Fair.          .

It's written in the 1st person thru the eyes of a 15-year old autistic.    i'm sorry that i threw it away as soon as i finished reading it.
B000001EGA|5.0|Elton John and Bernie Taupin closed the chapter of their peak years by writing a song cycle about how they got there. \\"Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy\\" put away the glitter and the costumes and painted an austere portrait of the artists in their hungry years. By reigning in the excess and making many of the songs modest and sincere, \\"Captain Fantastic\\" gave fans of Elton the best of both worlds. The simpler storytelling of the earlier part of Elton's career was matched to the increasing confidence of his and Bernie's songwriting. While there was no glammy-hit with catchy chorus to be found on this album, it is easily the most consistent work of their glory days. It even made history by becoming the very first album to enter the charts at number one.<br /><br />It is also the most sentimental of Elton's albums. The humble beginnings are underscored by the title track, and the orchestrated original closer of \\"Curtains/We All Fall In Love Sometimes\\" is beautifully done. The late Producer Gus Dudgeon made this album glow rather than flash - he may be one of the most underrated participants in Elton's career. (He passed away in 2002.) This was such a departure for Elton stylistically that only one song became a hit single, the song of love lost without regrets \\"Someone Saved My Life Tonight,\\" in which Long John Baldry and Bernie talked Elton out of going through with a marriage that would have seen him ending his musical career. It is a powerful ballad and fits in even better when positioned in the \\"Captain Fantastic\\" storyline.<br /><br />Because the album is a concept album, it is best listened to as a piece. The angry \\"Meal Ticket\\" is a great rock song, as is \\"Bitter Fingers.\\" But it is the way all the pieces fit that brings out the brilliance of this album. Even though two of the three bonus tracks are number one hits, they are actually a distraction here. Even the liner notes concede that point, claiming that Elton and Bernie were really trying to stay true to form, and had no issues with recording singles as items not album specific. Even so, how many albums can have bonus material as terrific as Elton's cover of \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" or concert classic \\"Philadelphia Freedom?\\" Anyway you look at it, bonus tracks or no, \\"Captain Fantastic and The Brown Dirt Cowboy\\" is a classic, the moment that captures all parties at the pinnacle of their powers at a time when they were also at their most commercially successful.<br /><br />After-note: I received this album for a gift on my 15th birthday, and met Elton John in Philadelphia in 1989. When I told him how I got the album (and the poster), he laughed and said \\"you're making me feel f'n old.\\" That poster - also signed by Bernie - is framed and hanging in a treasured spot on my office wall.had no issues with recording singles as items not album specific.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I could watch James Bond (read Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan, not all the pretenders) anytime.  There was no one more skeptical than me about Daniel Craig.  BOY was I wrong.  Craig fits the mold of Fleming's character (went back and studied that) and what a screen presence!  Overall, the entire movie was great.  Craig's physical presence was awesome.  And not using the classic line until the last line of the movie was enough to make me want to see the next movie in the series immediately.

B00004Y6O7|5.0|I believe I was in 5th grade, a big AC/DC fan. These were the days of LPs; big album covers and sleeves you could hold and admire, a little bit of crackle before the first notes hit, 2-sided albums where you took a quick intermission to turn to the second half. This was the early 80s where things had not become so cheesy.   <br />  <br />I remember listening to it the first time with my best friend who was the yin to my yang; me the AC/DC fan, my friend, the Van Halen fan. I had enjoyed Halen very much - how could you not? VH I, II and Women and Children were all wonderful albums and in the good old days radio had an array of tasty singles to choose from. I miss early 1980s radio - good times...  <br />  <br />But back to the first listen; the cover was a bit intimidating and as Eddie's intro to \\"Mean Streets\\" crept up on me, it was a surreal experience. Not nice but irresistible. After the punch in the face of \\"Mean Street\\", Dirty Movies is the perfect follow up - again probably more than I could understand at my age at the time, but that probably made it more fascinating. This was probably the first or second album that had a mysticism to it, along with amazing songs. This and Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\" were both albums I could not get enough of. Albums we would listen to over and over and discuss to no end.  <br />  <br />This would be a long review if I talk about every song. I love them all - but \\"Push Comes To Shove\\", \\"Mean Street\\", \\"Dirty Movies\\", \\"Sinner's Swing\\", and \\"Unchained\\" are my favorites. I'm still amazed at 11-year's old I was listening to this kind of music but I did have older siblings so I did get introduced to quite a bit.  <br />  <br />My only complaint is there aren't enough songs on \\"Fair Warning\\". Obviously VH was MAJORLY inspired in the studio for this one. There's an angst in the performances and the lyrics - but not some sort of rocker/punky angst. This Eddie Van Halen exploring his playing without much thought to commercialism and it really adds to the mood of the album. Same thing for Dave Lee Roth. I'm very sad they didn't squeak out several more songs - actually a double album would be preferred.
B000P0J024|5.0|Was very very happy when I heard of the release of this set.I had purchased Vol. 1 on cassette,the best in my opinion and  Vol. 3 on cd. All I really wanted to do was replenish my cassette for a cd on V 1. Than I heard of the dvd and the extra tracks.Really enjoyed the extra tracks on both discs,especially Maxine & Nobody's Child.Always loved the videos and was happy of the selection.Of course,V 1 had Handle With care,Headed For The Light and End of The Line.But after re-introducing myself to the album,discovered again,Dirty World,Not Alone Anymore and Margarita. An exceptional album.<br />As for V 3,I wasn't so crazy for it,except for Inside Out and The Wilbury Twist.But as the same with V 1,was re-introduced to the other tracks and didn't realize how good of an album it is. She's My Baby,The Devil's Been Busy,Poor House,New Blue Moon and Cool Dry Place.I'm sure I'm not the only one who enjoyed the albums more after their re-release. Me,being a big fan of Petty's,Harrison's,Lynne's productions and ELO and Dylan's turned me on instanlty when the original release came out. The only artist I was familiar with a little was Orbison,but that eventually changed.<br />So,I would recommend this to any new fans,which I'm sure there will be,who are fans of the artists mentioned. I would highly recommend picking this set up. You won't be disappointed and say ,I wasted money.
B00008J4P5|1.0|The rest sounds like he's just making it up in the studio, especially the childish attempts at lyrics. Here's a profound sample;    \\"The smile on your face made her think she had the right one  Then she thought she was sure  By the way you two could have fun  But now you're scared\\"    WOW...    I still think Weird Al Yankovich is more diverse a comic/musician, plus a better musician/lyricist.

B000PHX8QG|4.0|If the opening seconds of Justice's debut album, \\"Cross,\\" don't tell you a thing about what you're in store for, you aren't listening. The mudded brass come marching in like they are coming to destroy, and in a way they are. Justice is a dance/electronica group, to be sure, but to label them as such is travesty in and of itself. Like that imperial death march, Justice is here to destroy. In this case, they have come to demolish your preconceived notions about what dance music is and what it can be. Now, until recently I have avidly campaigned against the genre which I feel is cluttered with mundane \\"artists\\" who rely on bad samples and horrendous loops to captivate a somewhat dimwitted audience. My opinion is slowly starting to change as I am introduced to artists who are challenging this perception. Justice is one of them.<br /><br />From the opening track to the very last second of \\"Cross,\\" I found myself, not only captivated, but amazed, entertained, and energized. Justice comes off as a bull charging towards its victim, with so much momentum and energy that attempting to slow it down would be a fruitless endeavor. Their songs are constantly changing, never relying on a single loop or phrase for too long. And these songs are not lite, easy-listening electronica songs either. They're harsh and brash, with the mids turned up too high for comfort. It's not your average dance album, it is a revelation!<br /><br />\\"Let There Be Light\\" begins with a near-unlistenable melody, but adds in drums, a thumping bassline, and so many cuts and glitches that you'll be in love with it before you know it. It concludes with an absolutely awesome composition that harmonizes synths with synths in a way that sounds like it'd be better suited for the closing credits of a Super Mario Bros. game than a dance record. \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" is one of the few songs on \\"Cross\\" with actual vocals, and while I found them a bit childish and annoying at first, I was shocked to find the song stuck in my head hours after I first encountered. The song sounds like the Jackson 5 on methamphetamines, if only for the lyrics, \\"Do the D.A.N.C.E., stick to the B.E.A.T.\\" The disco-esque strings and sing-along quality of the song make the song a sure-fire hit, which is probably why it is the album's first single.<br /><br />Elsewhere on the album, there's the cut-filled \\"New Jack,\\" the completely overpowering, yet satisfying \\"Phantom Pt. I\\" (and it's more audience friendly second part), and the 100% guilty pleasure \\"The Party.\\" The latter features such terrible rap-lines as \\"Let's get drunk and freaky-fied,\\" and if you actually find yourself liking it, then you may want to see if pigs grew wings. It's the one low point on an otherwise flawless album.<br /><br />The best part about \\"Cross\\" is the fact that it never gets boring, an attribute clearly made possible by the group's insistence on keeping the songs fresh around every corner and their refusal to use one loop or riff for any extended period of time. The quality of the songs is through the roof, and the genres touched upon in each song are too numerous to mention. While \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\" is clearly your crowd-pleaser, songs like \\"Stress\\" (which envokes serious Requiem for a Dream soundtrack memories) and \\"Waters of Nazareth\\" are designed for the sole purpose of making you nod your head in approval while simultaneously scratching it, thinking \\"What the heck am I listening to?\\" \\"Cross\\" is an achievement in electronic music that should be listened to by fans and naysayers of the genre alike. Finding a true definition for the music contained on this album is impossible, so I'll just call it this: amazing!<br /><br />Recommended for fans of electronic music and anyone who wants to experience shock and awe firsthand.<br /><br />Key Tracks:<br />1. \\"Let There Be Light\\"<br />2. \\"D.A.N.C.E.\\"<br />3. \\"Phantom Pt.

0689865384|3.0|Okay, I'm editing my previous review. This book is quite alright. Not as good as expected, but maybe because I built it up to much. The sequels were good. but I preferred the sequels to the first. My opinion. I'm just being honest.
1932100660|5.0|The health crisis facing the United States is unprecedented in our history as a nation.  At the end of World War II we were the most advanced industrial nation in the world with the highest standard of living, one of the best health care systems and healthy citizens that lived longer than most people in other countries.  Today we are far behind the rest of the world in terms of our health. 2/3 of Americans are overweight and half of those, or 1/3, are obese.  1 out of 15 Americans (20 million) has  diabetes and in 20 years, at the current rate of increase, 1 out of 3 Americans (over 100 million) will have diabetes.  What is most alarming about these figures  is that diabetes is now at epidemic proportions in children and that was not the case just 20 years ago.  Heart disease is still the number one killer, cancer rates are the same despite all the billions that have been spent since Richard Nixon declared war on cancer 35 years ago and osteoporosis has been increasing, not only in the elderly but striking people at lower age levels every year.  The US currently spends more on health care per capita ($5,700) than any other country in the world (half again as much as the next two highest spenders, Switzerland and Germany) and yet we rank 29th in life expectancy.    The China study explains why this has happened to our country and what we can do to turn this situation around.  I have studied nutrition for over 30 years and   have never read such a thorough book on the subject from a scientific perspective. The book gives the reader all the latest scientific data from 65 counties across China and the results of questionnaires and blood tests on 6,500 adults.  This data was compared to studies done in other countries and the US.  The evidence revealed that people who consume a mostly plant-based diet had far less disease than those who consume the standard western  diet with a high percentage of animal protein.  In fact, the majority of people in the world who do not have the \\"luxury\\" of consuming much animal protein are not plagued by cancer, diabetes, heart disease, stroke and osteoporosis that are common in western societies.    The meat and dairy industries are going to fight this book the same way the tobacco industry fought and tried to suppress the information linking smoking to heart disease and cancer.  There is already a campaign in China to discredit this book by the dairy industry.  The irony is that most Chinese are lactose intolerant but the dairy industry answer is that they can take a pill to allow them to consume dairy products.  Although the meat and dairy industries will attempt to portray the information in this book as radical, the only thing that is radical are all the diseases afflicting Americans today that are the result of eating the way the meat and dairy industries have brainwashed us into believing is healthy.  If you want to change your life for the better then read this book.
B000HCO83Q|4.0|I've watched this movie a couple of times now, and I still can't decide if I like it or not. Some complain about Halle Berry's increased role in the film. I don't understand how she couldn't have a bigger part, since Cyclops and Professor X die and Jean is a zombie most of the time. That only leaves Wolverine and Storm as the remaining members of the team!<br />My question has to do with the script. Which came first, the poor script or folks jumping ship, or did a bad script get even worse when key players bolted?<br />Marsden and Singer ran off to do Superman. Superman was good, but it wasn't great. Since the story is about Dark Phoenix, it would seem that Marsden would have had a bigger role as Cyclops in X-Men than as Lois Lane's fiance. And Singer had done the two previous very successful X-Men movies. Why would he think doing Superman would be better than XMIII? It sounds like both men knew a bad thing when they saw it and ran away as fast as they could.<br />And what about Patrick Stewart? Did the original story called for Xavier's death, or did Mr. Stewart want to be written out of the story? His death seemed to serve no purpose in the storyline - other than it was easier to show her evil side by killing him off as opposed to having DP destroy star systems as she did in the comic.<br />Of course the other possibility is that they were setting up the Wolverine movie by doing away with the X-Men......
B000BP86OG|4.0|I've recently pulled out my copy of \\"One Way Ticket to Hell...And Back\\" to verify a few parts of the title track (which I have been singing (apparently successfully) at karaoke (GASP!)). Though I've always enjoyed this album, I was surprised to find out how much better the album is than I remembered. \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\", with its \\"sensitive\\" verses full of chiming guitars and '80s-on-the-Sunset-Strip chords (not to mention its Boston-styled acoustic-guitar-chugging-next-to-stacks-of-Marshalls and über-harmonies) should be a summer single, and has been treated as such in my car stereo. \\"Knockers\\" is a fun number (that does *not* refer to, um, blinkers) that seems to best recall the first album. \\"Is It Just Me?\\" and the title track are fist-raising numbers that must absolutely kick solid a** live (because they do a fine job of it on album), and \\"English Country Garden\\" is just manic. Anyone wanting catchy choruses, walls of guitars and well-prepared basslines (not to mention excellently-recorded drums) come right here.    But what REALLY prompted me to write a review were other reviewers' comments that The Darkness does not surpass their influences. I want to put a stop to this before another GREAT band is basically ruined in an attempt to become truly \\"original\\". Safely put, \\"original\\" flew out the window when everybody and their dog saw their back catalogue released on CD. Lindsey Buckingham was taking inspiration from the Everly Brothers on the verses to \\"Go Your Own Way\\", Boston's Tom Scholz has admitted to being inspired by the James Gang's \\"Tend My Garden\\" for his classic \\"More Than a Feeling\\", Marvin Gaye's smash single \\"What's Goin' On\\" was stalled by the brass at Motown because they thought it was too \\"old hat\\" for their scene (\\"Nobody does scat anymore!\\"), and no one will ever convince me that '80s hair metal bands such as Poison and Motley Crüe didn't take a page from '70s glam (and not only in fashion). The reason why these bands/artists were considered original (as compared to maybe the Darkness) is that their influences were kept relatively obscure (I mean, come on, how many youth today know of \\"Tend My Garden\\"?). Today's discerning listener knows of Slade, Boston and Queen beforehand (not to mention many a band who've unsuccessfully tried to match this powerful trio). But please LAY OFF The Darkness for being \\"unoriginal\\"! I will fully proclaim my Revisionist's Cry of \\"Recognize the good, eschew the bad, and make it better this time around!\\" And that is a challenge to which I feel The Darkness answer in spades. And to add to that the fact that they are often tongue-in-cheek, it makes their harmonized operatic falsetto vocal parts and bent-note guitarmonies (check out that \\"WHOOMWHOOMwhoomwhoom\\" effect little over a quarter into the solo of \\"Dinner Lady Arms\\" after the orgasmic squeal of three guitars in one... sheer genius, whoever recognized that one) even MORE appealing. This is an album that took time and effort to create, and just like the first Boston album, all that sweat paid off. The reason why I am not giving it five stars is because half the album has yet to plant itself into my memory (I'm too busy listening to the other half), but this is already two to four great songs more than a lot of '80s hair band albums... and would you give Boston's \\"Don't Look Back\\" anything less than four stars, even if Side 2 is undercooked? Didn't think so. RAWK ON!
0790740443|3.0|Critically smashed at the time and DOA at the box office, Soldier was one a huge run of mega budgeted flops Warner Bros released in 1997 & 1998. But the suprise is how good this by the numbers sci-fi actioner really is.<br /><br />Kurt Russell gives one of his greatest performances as the emotionally stunted lead character. It's a true tour de force of cinematic acting-he hardly says a word, but his eyes, expression and body language surge through the screen.<br /><br />Paul WS Anderson's direction is efficient and tight, it's more his approach to the the look and feel of the material that's the problem. David Webb People's script is terrific and you can't help but wonder what Ridley Scott or John McTiernan might have be able to do with this.<br /><br />This is kind of an 80's throwback that you could imagine being an absolute blockbuster for Schwarzenegger in his prime- but it's 10 years too late, despite the brilliant work of it's star.
0783114893|4.0|If you're going to pick up a Hitcher, be sure that it's this original from 1986.<br /><br />In 1981, Rutger Hauer made his American film debut as diabolical terrorist \\"Wulfgar\\" in Nighthawks [[ASIN:B0001FGBWK Nighthawks]] . 5 years later he appeared in the original The Hitcher in the role of John Ryder, one of the most ruthless serial psycho killers ever to be born on the big screen.<br /><br />The 1986 version had a very 80s feel to it then, and re-watching it this past weekend, I can say that it is indeed very 80s. But it's very well done. There are some over-the-top stunts that would have killed any ordinary serial killer. But that was part of the mystique of John Ryder. Was he human? Was he a monster? Was he the Devil?<br /><br />The Hitcher's director in 1986 was Robert Harmon, who pretty much tuned to TV after The Hitcher, which is probably a good thing because the \\"TV camp\\" definitely came through in a lot of his original version of The Hitcher, but overall it was exciting and unforgettable.<br /><br />Fast Forward 21 years and music video Director Dave Meyers re-does 1986's The Hitcher with an all new cast and a few minor story changes [[ASIN:B000NO3DLG The Hitcher (Widescreen Edition)]] . Yes...I said \\"re-does\\" as opposed to \\"re-makes\\". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it better. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original (and in most cases makes it worse). The 2007 version of The Hitcher is a re-do.<br /><br />While the 2007 version definitely does take the 80s feel out of the original, it also takes a lot out of the fiendish, classic villain that was created by Rutger Hauer. Sean Bean is in the role of John Ryder in the 2007 version. Yes, Bean has played his share of villains, so he had no problem as a bad guy in The Hitcher 2007, but it was like taking Robert Englund out of Freddy Krueger...it just wasn't the same.<br /><br />Look, I'm not a big preservationist that thinks remaking good original movies should be taboo. I just think that a re-make should indeed be that...a re-make...not a re-do.<br /><br />So regardless of what your Mom has told you....You can indeed pick up a Hitcher; just make sure that it's the original.just think that a re-make should indeed be that...a re-make...not a re-do.    So regardless of what your Mom has told you....You can indeed pick up a Hitcher; just make sure that it's the original.
B000MZHW40|4.0|What a heavy price to pay for jewerly. Kanye West wasn't lying when he made his video about children dying over diamonds. This was a really sad brutal truth about the murders that go on in South Africa because of diamonds. It's filled with violence. Although it's action packed, I thought the little romance between the reporter and the soldier seemed thrown in and it slowed the movie down and made it boring during those parts. It also makes the reporter out to be somewhat of the hero. I didn't like that either. Certain parts were just unrealistic like how the reporter seemed to always walk away with just a bruise after running from the rebels. Meanwhile the guys were all bruised and sweaty. But, in the end this was definitely educational, but very graphic. Maybe that was the point?

B000001ESN|5.0|Enough has been said about this album already by others that anything I add would simply be superfluous, except to suggest that, aside from Geddy's different vocal approach (probably brought about by age as much as anything else) this would be the last album where Alex would be the star attraction. Whether that was a conscious decision on his part, a collective decision made by the group as a whole, or just a genetic mutation is a subject perhaps Neil should write a song about! Suffice to say that, as a guitar player for 30 years, the solo in 'Freewill' is still, today, up there with the best that May, Gilbert, Satriani, et al can put forward.

The author describes people and locations with amazing precision and texture. The story weaves in and out of different timelines, but everything connects perfectly. This book will change your life.
B000002L61|3.0|but dated now.<br /><br />'80's Heavy Metal is now so dated that this album lost all its fire only a few years after it was released, and most of those bands from that period have gone the way of the Dodo. The sound of this album is only one part of the problem: the guitars sound thin compared to the heavy albums of today, and the bass and drums are just completely lost in the mix.<br /><br />The other problem goes to the songwriting: nothing wrong with the subject matter, but musically the world has circumnavigated the sun too many times for these standard '80's riffs to cut it anymore.<br /><br />It gets 3 stars simply because it stars RJ Dio. I'm honestly surprised it's even available these days!

B000PFUAO6|2.0|DT's musicianship is solid as ever, but their lyrics are becoming so dark and depressing that I want to find a knife and slash my wrists after my first listening. I used to be excited and inspired after listening to a DT CD, but ever since Octavarium, they have taken a downward trip to the depths of dispair...it is really sad. John Petrucci is probably the biggest offender here.  With his lyrics for \\"In the Presence of Enemies Parts 1 and 2, and especially \\"The Dark Eternal Night\\" and \\"The Ministry of Lost Souls\\". He (They) have got to lighten up a bit.  I am sad to say that this will be the first of all the DT CDs that I have that I will be selling to the Used CD store. I hope they \\"dream\\" of something more positive next time.
0743289684|5.0|I have seen Ayaan Hirsi-Ali interviewed and knew who she was when I got this book, which was riveting from the moment I started to read it.  Her life story (to date) is an amazing road of transformation and realization.  This woman has determination, intelligence, and courage beyond anyone I have ever met.  As a woman born and raised in America and having opportunities available to me from the beginning, I am humbled tremendously by the incredible accomplishments of Hirsi-Ali.  Born in Somalia, one of the poorest nations on earth, and having lived in Kenya, Saudi Arabia and Ethiopia under strict Muslim faith, she managed to educate herself beyond the restrictions of the religion, escape the prison of such a male dominated culture and realize the hypocrisy of the world in which she existed.  Against all odds, she survived female genitle mutilation at the age of six, learned to speak several languages, and ultimately disgraced her family by refusing to marry someone she barely knew by seeking asylum in Holland.  Amid death threats, she further educated herself and ultimately became a member of the Parliament in Holland with a focus on women's rights and wrote a film about the submission of women in Islam which resulted in the horrific murder of it's director, Theo Van Gogh.  The assasins composed a letter to Hirsi-Ali and stabbed it into VanGogh's chest.  Her courage to share with us the tragic and horrifying events of her life, including severe beatings, a fractured skull, and her ultimate denouncement of Islam, demonstrates her determination to call to reality the backwards ideology of Islam, specifically the fundamental aspects, which threatens the Western World. She is grateful for all that she saw in the modern world, from friendly police men to social workers and democratic governmental agencies.  She was fascinated by bus schedules that ran on time, garbage collection, and all the things we in the West take for granted, including welfare. As Hirsi-Ali was amazed by hot and cold running showers, I am in awe of Hirsi-Ali and wish more educated women of Islam could find such strength and courage to stop the ignorance and violence and hatred that is ingrained in the children in the name of Allah.  Unfortunately, education and poverty is at the core of fundamental Islam and it is unlikely to change in those regions where Islam is the law, corruption abundant and women are enslaved.  Her insight is invaluable, her honesty is applauded and her curiosity, which brought her to where she is today, is refreshing.  Tragically, those values cost her a family who have disowned her and see her as an Infidel, but ironically, her choice to accept and embrace freedom has made her someone they should be very proud of because she is truly a woman of great honor, admiration and success.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We watched much of the Discovery Channel American version without the advantage of having a Tivo. Once the commercials drove us crazy we looked on Amazon and found this BBC original version. The narrated scripts are almost identical in the two versions and you gain all those minutes of program that were edited out to allow for commercials every 5-10 minutes.    When you see a program series of this quality you wonder why television cannot do it \\"right\\" more often. This is spectacular stuff and we will watch it off and on for years to come. If you have middle grade school children and up, buy it. Some of the images may be a little too intense for younger kids (or you can hit the fast forward button).

B00005ATZT|5.0|Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones deliver towering performances in this gripping thriller.      PLOT SYNOPSIS    Dr. Kimble (Harrison Ford) arrived home one night to find his wife Helen on the verge of death after being brutally attacked by a one armed maniac.  Before she died, she was able to make a desperate call to 9-11, so the police arrive shortly after the incident, just in time to find Helen dead.  The police notice that Kimble is all scratched up, as though he had just been in a fight or had just murdered his wife himself.  Despite Kimble's description of the true culprit, the police arrest him and charge him of his wife's murder.   The trial goes badly and Kimble is sentenced to death by execution.    On a prison bus, on his way to the facility that housed the chamber that would eventually kill him, some other convicts attempt to pull off an escape.  There is a violent uprising inside of the bus and the lumbering vehicle tumbles down a hill and stops on a railroad track.  The oncoming train collides with the bus and creates one of the most spectacular train wreck scenes to ever appear on film.  By chance, Kimble, and another convict, make it out of the crash alive and set out on foot to escape the law enforcement personnel who are sure to appear once they learn about the disaster.    Unfortunately for Kimble, the federal marshal who is put in charge of the operation is none other than Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones), who is completely determined, quick-thinking, and efficient.  He is unbendingly bound to his duty and will stop at nothing to catch his man.  This is revealed in the famous tunnel scene, when Kimble points a gun at him and says \\"I did not kill my wife,\\" Gerard retort is the cold \\"I don't care.\\"    Since Kimble has already been convicted and sentenced to death, his chances of resurrecting any kind of life are exceedingly grim.  He can either hide out for the rest of his life, or try to lead law enforcement to the real culprit.  In order to accomplish the second option, Kimble would have to investigate himself, and somehow, based on the scant evidence at his disposal, somehow find the criminal.  But can he do it before the brilliant Gerard closes in on him?      ACTING    Tommy Lee Jones' performance is one of those performances that won, and actually did deserve to win the Oscar.  Every second of Jones' performance is absolutely convincing.  It is rare that an individual's character can be developed so fully in a two hour film.  He is more than the stereotypical, \\"success at all costs\\" law enforcement office.  From his persuasive scowls when he hears of Kimble's successes, to the tone of his voice when he barks orders and makes observations, his performance alone is enough to watch this movie several times.    Harrison Ford logs in another solid performance.  Over the course of the last 30 years, Ford has been one of the most consistent actors of all time.  The Fugitive is actually one of his better roles.  He plays the part of Richard Kimble to near perfection.    It is not uncommon to see two huge stars on one film at the same time, but it is uncommon that they perfectly fit the characters that they are asked to portray, and it is nothing short of a rarity that they interact in such a memorable fashion as they did in the fugitive.    The more minor actors are nothing special, but they are not bad either.  Jerome Krabbe played a respectable Dr. Charles Nichols,, with his hair parted neatly to the side and his somewhat nerdy smile, he represented what most Americans picture when they imagine a highly educated doctor.  Joe Pantoliano played Cosmo, Gerard's assistant.  We get a lot of sarcasm in a high pitched voice, and that is what Pantoliano is known for.  It added some extra entertainment and made the mechanical law enforcement machine slightly more human-like.      SO DOES IT THRILL?    How does the fugitive stack up against other thrillers?  Most thrillers, even some successful ones, have a small amount of tension causing elements.  The movie-makers work with a somewhat limited script, and get as much thrill as they can on two or three suspense-provoking fundamentals.  Sometimes these movies do an excellent job at thrilling us, and leave us satisfied.  The producers, directors, and actors of the fugitive did not need to stretch out every possible element for cheap thrills, the script, which took years and million dollars in development, thrills the audience on multiple levels.  Even mediocre actors would have turned this script into a nail-biting experience, the super performances by Jones and Ford only make it even better.    This one is definitely a classic in its genre.  If you still haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and check it out.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is one of those albums that is almost impossible to outdo. Every song is brilliant. Meteora and Minutes To Midnight were fantastic, but I find myself grabbing this one whenever I'm craving LP. I rank this #1 in my HUGE music collection.
1400032717|5.0|This is a lovely, unique book.  The writer certainly has his finger on the pulse of autism.  While a novel, it is a simple, delightful read, following the main character who is autistic, written in the first person, on his quest to find out who had murdered a neighborhood dog.  Where it takes him, however, is a journey to self-discovery and family secrets.  The book also contains visual expressions of what the character sees and how he thinks at times, and thus, probably would not translate well to audio.  At times, the book is funny and sad for the reader as we sift through the seemingly emotionally detached world in which the character lives, yet we are engrossed by the details and inane observations of the things he does focus on.  This book is one of my all time favorites and I have recommended it to many people, all of who have enjoyed it immensely.  As I read this book, I wondered if everyone doesn't have a touch of autism in themselves...like when you talk with someone and they have a seed between their teeth and you can't stop thinking about the seed and whether you should tell the person and ultimately, you have no idea what your conversation entailed because you obsessed over the seed and retained nothing of the discussion. On the otherhand, you could feel the anguish of parenting a child with autism and the daily struggles they faced handling the child's repetive and obsessive behaviors, tantrums and phobias. I couldn't put this book down and finished it in two days.  There's a few math equations in the book as the boy is a bit of a mathematical savant, but if you aren't a math wizard yourself, it's simple enough to skim through that without missing anything relevent in the storyline.  All in all, this book is a great summer read, a great rainy weekend read, or a great dreary winter read.
0553208845|5.0|I thought this was a very good book.
B000P0J02E|5.0|The soundtrack was exciting with it's action sequences, but also with it's love theme. The love theme was my favorite I guess, and I enjoyed the way it was woven throughout almost all of the tracks. My favorites would have to be \\"One Day,\\" which is the most moving of the whole album and \\"Up is Down,\\" for it's playfulness. But overall it's a good listen, even the strange \\"Multiple Jacks\\" track. The vocals on the soundtrack don't seem out of place, and go well with each sequence. The At World's End soundtrack is definitely worth having if you love movie scores.

B000P0J024|5.0|It's hard to write a review about this new collection, since much of what I'd like to say has been echoed in nearly *every* review thus far.  That being said, this is a simply brilliant release, one that truly reminds us just how uplifting music can be, and more importantly, how great music *never* gets old.  Nearing the 20-year mark, these songs sound as fresh and poignant as they did back in 88/90 respectively, and with each repeated listen, I love them more and more.     What really makes this collection a smash is the inclusion of just about everything the Wilburys did.  From the two bonus tracks on Vlm1 (Maxine, absolutely brilliant Harrison, and Like A Ship, a Dylan-meets-Lynne with an incredibly 'Beatle-y' middle-8) to the additional tracks on Vlm3, it's such an overwhelmingly positive vibe, that you just can't stop listening.  I've literally moved these CDs from Car to Home Stereo, back to the Car, and just can't get enough.  And, if you don't nearly shed a tear watching the (short, but unbelievably effective) DVD documentary on the making of the Wilburys, well, then watch it again.  It's heart-warming, it makes you long for Harrison and Orbison, and it really emphasizes the greatness and the legacy that these two (along with the other surviving members) have left behind.     And, on the remastering front: awesome.  Loud, punchy, (especially the kick drums and bass---not overdone, but you really feel Jim 'Sidebury' Keltner!) with vocals literally jumping out at you.  And, despite the fact that these are technically 80s recordings (okay, 1990 as well), they don't sound it, simply because (as you'll learn in the DVD), Lynne and Harrison really kept the production to using 'natural' sounds, ie, no echoey-reverbed-gated Drums, no cheesy, digital delayed vocals and guitars; basically, pure sound, as it existed in the room, played together.  Again, brilliant.      So, what else can one say about the Traveling Wilburys??  It may be the 'End of the Line'...but that's what 'repeat' on your CD player is for.  Buy it.  Listen to it, and re-experience the feeling of divine musical magic.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|World at War is a classic!  The combination of high-level policymakers' viewpoints and individual citizens' and soldiers' viewpoints gives excellent understanding of the events and issues.  I highly recommend it for individuals or classes who want to learn about WWII.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|It's not their best effort.  The songs are heavy and some are fast-paced which always a good thing.  For a rock album, its good.  For a Pearl Jam album, its ok.

B000065V41|4.0|I watch this film twice a year, at least. I am disappointed about the screen format, but the story and characters are intact. Also intact is the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" and I have the 2002 DVD edition. This is a magical movie and all ages will love it.

B00005JPAO|1.0|I was not surprised at the selfish, egotistical, arrogance of the monarchy.  I was surprised at the lack of humanity for Dianna!  She was a beautiful person, who deserved a lot more recognition and respect!  She was ostracized because she was not cold and indifferent like the rest.  She was looked down on because she reached out to others and was not afraid to be human.  She was a ray of sunshine in a drab grey existence!  And this movie centered around a stuffy arrogant spoiled rich brat.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|A friend gave me this CD as I'm a Beatles fan, even own the old wooden CD boxed set.  I did not expect to like it, as the first thing I had heard about it was Cirque.  Boy, was I in for a big surprise.<br /><br />I adore this album.  It was beyond my wildest dreams.  I was never a fan of Strawberry Fields Forever (yeah I know I'm in the minority here) but I really enjoy it on this album.  It is almost a new song.<br /><br />It still manages to have the George Martin touch, even though his son is involved in it.  The only downfall (and I'd give it 4 1/2 stars for this if I could) is the melody portion.<br /><br />I enjoyed this CD enough to go out and buy Let It Be...Naked.  I'm not a big CD buyer as my collection is mainly 50's and 60's music (before my time)--much of it only available on LP, but LOVE did inspire me enough to make the trip to the store.
6305364648|3.0|\\"True Lies\\" is one of my favorite action films, being at the same time one of the prototypical mid 1990's action films and a parody of the same genre. It strikes a perfect balance between humor and action throughout the course of the film. It's a must see if you like Arnold.    However, the DVD release presented here is brutal. Do not let the THX certification on the front of the DVD case fool you. The film is presented in 2.35:1 aspect ration, but is not anamorphic widescreen, a format optimized for widescreen televisions. It is presented in letterbox format instead, which means that the picture is much, much worse than its anamorphic equivalent because the black bars at the top and bottom are actually encoded into the video stream. This process leaves less room in the video encoding for the actual image, reducing its quality. Anamorphic widescreen leaves the black bars out of the video encoding, preserving more of the video stream for the actual image and allowing the DVD player and TV to add the black bars if necessary. Since a widescreen TV does not have need for these bars, they can be left off entirely, leaving only the high quality image.    Anamorphic widescreen has been a standard feature of DVDs for years now, so it's easy to forget that not all DVDs have it. Old DVDs are especially suspect on this front. If you have a nice television, the lack of anamorphic widescreen will be very noticeable and distracting throughout the film. Maybe it will be out on Blu-ray soon...
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Miss Potter is based on the life of Beatrix Potter, children's author and artist of \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\\" \\"Jemima Puddleduck,\\" and \\"Benjamin Bunny\\" - among many others. Beatrix was raised in London by aristocratic parents who sheltered her from the rest of the world. Her childhood was influenced by the summers her family spent at the Lake District, where Beatrix would sketch the animals she encountered.<br /><br />As a grown woman of 32, Beatrix is considered an \\"old maid\\" and has decided that she shall not marry. She puts her drawings and childhood stories into a book, \\"The Tale of Peter Rabbit,\\" and meets with two brothers who own a publishing house. The brothers agree to publish her book, but only so they can foist the project off on their younger brother Norman, who they are sure will fail.<br /><br />What ensues is magic. Norman cares passionately about Miss Potter's book, and it becomes a huge success. They continue to make books together - and they fall in love. Her mother, who hates it when Beatrix brings \\"trades people\\" into the house (they bring in dirt), is horrified.<br /><br />I won't tell you any more of the plot, because I want you to see this movie. It is a love story, a story of a young woman becoming her own person, and an imaginative fairy tale. The scenery of the Lake District in Britain is reason enough to watch the film. Throw in brilliant performances by Renee Zellweger, Ewan McGregor, and Emily Watson, mix in the beautiful watercolors of Potter herself, and you have a perfect film.<br /><br />For fellow Monarch of the Glen fans, there's also a treat: Lloyd Owen, who plays Archie's brother Paul on Monarch, also appears in the film.<br /><br />It is rated PG for brief mild language, but for the life of me I can't remember what it was.
B000O1799U|1.0|I was very disappointed.  Everyone has compared this story to the Supremes, but the music was not even close to the Supremes.  It was more like from the 40's.  It didn't sound anything like the 60's music or even the music from the 50's.  It reminded me more of Westside Story.  It was a mis-representation.  I am a big Beyonce Knowles fan, but the music provided for her was a big disappointment.
6305892806|5.0|Excellent..superb..well acted..well scripted..dark and brooding......I could go on and on! We review FILMS here at Amazon...not the book from which the film came! As a film, Patricia Rozema's adaptation of Jane Austen's MANSFIELD PARK stands on it's own as a stinging, satirical view of the life and times of one Fanny Price in 1806 England. All that is Austen,the \\"advantageous alliances\\" that are made through marriage, scandals that could kill a family's reputation, the pecking order of sons for inheritance, and the heart as the moral compass and guide are all here, and brought to the screen with great effect infused with a little bit of naughtiness and innuendo. This retelling of MANSFIELD PARK is so interesting and wonderfully reconceived that it far outweighs the BBC version for it's fresh and new characterizations of Fanny and the Bertrams and the Crawfords.    What I really like about this MANSFIELD PARK is Rozema's clever weaving of the English Slave Trade into the fiber of the film. No doubt this WAS THE hot topic of the time as in 1807 the trade of the Middle Passage WAS abolished in England.(See the current film AMAZING GRACE)Yes,people who sought their fortunes in it DID turn \\"to tobacco\\",which was the trade simply continued in America!!!    As far as performances...they are OUTSTANDING. Harold Pinter as Sir Thomas was played with great complexity and the late Sheila Gish as Fanny's Aunt is one of the best comedic turns yet for an Austen adaptation!    Lesley Barber's soundtrack is lush, romantic and also full of witty motifs to propel the action.    This MANSFIELD PARK is full of fine direction, sets, costumes and modern sensibility that makes the timeless Austen all the more compelling.The film never lags and is quite clever. 5******'s for Rozema's Austen!
1401211909|5.0|Fairy tales tend to lose their sparkle when they're made into books for adults.<br /><br />But Neil Gaiman creates his own sparkling fairy tale in \\"Stardust,\\" an entrancing fantasy tale that never loses its magic. With beautiful prose, likable characters, and a mesh of the grotesque and the ethereal, this is Gaiman's reworking of fairy tales -- with a slight wink to the readers.<br /><br />Years ago, Dunstan Thorn fell in love with a beautiful slave from across the Wall. Nine months later, he got a baby boy on his doorstep. His son Tristan grows up unaware of his heritage, and longs for the beautiful, frosty Victoria Forester. When she rejects him, he makes a rash promise -- he'll pursue a fallen star over the Wall and bring it back to her, if she gives him her hand.<br /><br />But when he finds the star, he learns that it is a beautiful young girl, a daughter of the moon named Yvaine. The dying Lord of Stormheld threw a gem to the distance and accidently knocked her from the sky. Now his sons are trying to get the gem back, since the one who gets the gem will be the next Lord. What is more, an ancient witch is pursuing the star, determined to cut out her heart so she and her sisters can be young again. To protect the lovely star, Tristan is called on to be a hero, and to learn who he really is...<br /><br />Few fantasy stories are as well-done as \\"Stardust.\\" Gaiman mixes humor, romance, grisly realism and airy-fairiness in a tight little plot. It only really picks up two-thirds of the way into the book, but what a trip it is. It slides rather than explodes to a conclusion, where everything slips into place and all the loose ends are neatly tied together, in a way that makes perfect sense.<br /><br />His writing is a mix of beautiful details and fast-moving plot. Gaiman frequently pauses to describe the creepy Stormhelm, where murdered ghosts watch their brothers compete, to the beautiful forests of Faerie where little sprites mock people. Some scenes -- like a unicorn's skewering a witch -- are breathtakingly vivid.<br /><br />Everybody loves an everyman hero, and despite his mystery background, Tristan definitely qualifies. He's a little goofy and a lot clueless, but his earnestness makes him likable. Yvaine is a bit off-kilter in a good way, sharp-tongued and a little naive, but a good match for Tristan. And supporting characters like the evil Septimus and youth-hungry witch are solidly written; even Victoria is shown in a new light.<br /><br />This particular edition is graced with Charles Vess's exquisite illustrations -- delicate, colourful, ethereal, full of little details and shadowy corners. He captures every shred of the magic that Gaiman's words are able to conjure, and a little bit more than that.<br /><br />The beautiful adult fairy-tale \\"Stardust\\" is an entrancing read, wonderfully written and full of intriguing characters.

B000BB14YY|3.0|The film has been around as an arthouse favourite for years but this new dvd version add so much - full interviews and background makes the film come to life.  This legendary director deservedly carries the title as a Master in Japan and should have been declared a Living Treasure in his lifetime.  I am going to order the other movies by the master as well!

B000OMD4BG|5.0|Listening to the gorgeous double-album beggar's banquet that is New Moon, it becomes obvious that Elliott Smith's friends and survivors may have done him something of a disservice by loading down From a Basement on the Hill with so many \\"ugly,\\" dissonant songs that put his character flaws and occasionally odd mannerisms on display so overtly.  This is not to say that a lot of Basement didn't rock impressively.  Indeed, it offered the best and most harrowing portrait of an urban \\"scene\\" since the glory days of Nirvana.  But it also came unraveled once too often, suggesting that Smith was losing control by the hour and that his violent untimely death could almost be rationalized as inevitable.    I loved Elliott Smith, and was very lucky to have seen him in concert once.  I am still hoping a live album (with full-bodied full-band versions of acoustic classics like \\"Needle in the Hay\\") might yet be released.  But until that comes our way, New Moon will more than do as a worthy epitaph for this brilliant musician who was doubtlessly too sensitive, too poetic, and too idealistic for his own good.  Some of the lyrics on New Moon see all the way through to the burnt-out core of relationships with that Superman x-ray vision we came to expect after Either/Or and X/O.  At the same time, the music shuffles and ambles like a man who's trying to slip out of the room and down the highway before the unbearable tension rises to its fevered pitch -- \\"looking over my shoulder,\\" as one of the titles goes -- and yet can't help but tease the headlights of the oncoming truck.      Being unable to stop himself from getting immersed in things that weren't good for him, while at the same time striving with Herculean effort to get disentangled from those same quagmires -- Smith lived this daily conflict in his life and his art.  The fact that he didn't, couldn't, make it out alive is one of the central tragedies of my generation -- it's a heartache that we can't grow older and wiser with himanymore.  But New Moon, a better epitaph than Basement, shows that he's still somewhere far ahead of us, relaying back signals from a world of pure feeling that most of us have only visited in passing.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|All \\"Icky Thump\\" initially brought to mind was Graham Chapman telling Terry Jones how to say, \\"Eee, ecky thump!\\" into a mike.<br /><br />But it's also the title of the White Stripes' sixth album, and after the mediocre dry spell of \\"Get Behind Me Satan,\\" it's nice to hear that the Stripes seem to have regained their creative juices. This time they pack the album with dark seventies-style rock'n'roll and some traditional folk flourishes.<br /><br />It kicks off with the dark, plodding guitar that blazes up to life every few seconds, and a sinuous synth ripple that slithers through the melody. \\"Icky thump/Who'da thunk?/Sittin drunk on a wagon to Mexico?\\" Jack yowls, describing the less pleasant corners of Mexico, and taking a moment to jab at Americans (\\"Why don't you kick yourself out/You're an immigrant too!\\").<br /><br />It softens up a lot for the catchy, bluesier rocker \\"You Don't Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You're Told),\\" and the mellow gritty \\"300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues.\\" Then the album goes through two phases: the first is one of British and Scottish folkiness, and a trumpety rocker that sounds like a B-side from Beirut. Then the last leg of the album slips back to blazing rock'n'roll, full of dark energy and retro organ.<br /><br />I never quite figured out what was going on in the halfhearted \\"Get Behind Me Satan,\\" except that every band has their dud. And fortunately \\"Icky Thump\\" is everything that album wasn't -- spirited, creative, enthusiastic, and full of those little moments and brilliant instrumentation that bring it alive. Nice to see they haven't run out of juice yet.<br /><br />Yeah, we have Jack blazing away like a forest fire on his guitars, whether it's softer blues riffs, ringing blasts or hard-rocking swirls. And Meg smashes the drums like no other.

B00006F7S4|5.0|have you ever felt like you're about to totally spaz out and everything is out of control? Put this album on and it will cure your ailment better than any drug.  Some moments on this album reach the kind of transcendent peaks you hear very rarely on any album - the geniunely haunted Round the Bend, the yearning of Little One and the understated humor of Lost Cause.  Plus, if you ever need a cheap and automatic laugh, just take a look at the album cover - you can read many things into it but chiefly, I think Beck is trying to tell us - \\"Man, that chick just blew my mind\\".
0876852630|5.0|This book brings to mind Post Office though Chinaski finds himself in less stable circumstances. The title refers indirectly to a worker who has had many occupations yet is a master of none. He seems to only stay with a job for about a month or two and then moves on to another one in another city without any aim other than drinking and womanizing. The menial jobs simply fund his habits. His sour outlook on living in gentle seem to touch on the very cords of drunken and sober reality. People move along like ants at some absurd tasks and very rarely do people question why this is so. Bukowski's books are generally in the vein of Factotum yet this particular novel seems to go well after reading Post Office.
0316067598|5.0|I found this story to be a chilling reminder of the cost of war and how one side is willing to fight the war and the other....while being more then able to win this war...is not willing to do what is necessary to fight this war.  Our grandparents of WWII are known as the greatest generation that ever lived.  Mainly becuase of the sacrifices that they were willing to go through in order to win against evil.  I am afraid that if our generation is remembered at all it will be only as a footnote in history as teh generation that destroyed America as a World Power.  Read your history books ladies and gentleman....Europe thought that they could talk to Hitler and reason with him as well. These people that we are fighting want only one thing....and that is the elimination of the Western Culture.  To the soldiers who are fighting I say carry on and god bless.  Your acts along with your mission are honorable and needed.
0552998087|2.0|There is plenty to satirize and poke fun at in America but make it clever,do it with incite, and do it with humor.  After thoroughly enjoying 2 Bryson books, A Walk in The Woods, and, A Short History of Nearly Everything, this was very disappointing.   It started, laugh out loud funny but...by the 3rd chapter or so, I was  thinking I was wasting my time. I felt by the end it was a book he wrote  for easy money.   He drives from town to town, staying in cheap motels, watching TV in the evenings and makes virtually no attempt to engage the locals. He bemoans the changes and commercialization that has transformed many locations since his family visited in his childhood, any of us could make those observations.  His attitude is condescending. He simply makes sarcastic remarks and draws conclusions about towns and people based on buying gas, renting a motel room or eating in a local restaraunt. Making fun of waitreses and people who were genuinely trying to help him is not my idea of a humorous, or inciteful look at America.   The fact that Bryson is an observant, humorous, mid-westerner who has lived abroad for 20+ years should have made for an A-1 read.  Instead, I told my wife and sons, forget this one.

B000007MVD|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.<br /><br />Doesn't it seem unfathomable that a band in their own stratosphere like the Beatles could have any releases that are underrated?  The truth is there are many that aren't aware of the pure brilliance of the \\"BBC\\" and \\"Hamburg Germany\\" CD's.<br /><br />It doesn't get much better than the opportunity to hear not only the plethora of songs included on the double disc but the diversity of the material.  Do we take the Beatles for granted?  There are times.  If you listen to the music straight through it is easy to see why you may have a new appreciation for their collective genius.  If you study what they were doing in 1962 compared to any other  releases, it didn't take a special ear to comprehend great things were already here and a new level of honor would soon be created.<br /><br />The Beatles could take a cover tune and make you think it was there own.  They could mesmerize you with a ballad one moment and rock the house the next.  That is what the \\"BBC\\" selections are all about.<br /><br />Don't let any mention of some of the tracks sounding rough stray your course.  It adds to the charm, as if you are hearing it way back when!<br /><br />\\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" followed by \\"All My Loving.\\"  One of the many pleasurable aspects of the listening journey are the wonderful renditions of songs they didn't put on the released studio recordings these include but are not limited to the next five songs mentioned: \\"Shot of Rhythm and Blues\\" and \\"Some Other Guy\\" sound delectable through your speakers.  \\"Carol\\", Johnny B. Goode\\", and \\"Memphis\\" couldn't sound any grander if they did it 100 more times.<br /><br />When the Beatles paid homage to Chuck Berry and Little Richard and their other rhythm and blues heroes, they didn't cheat their own core of fans with the end results.<br /><br />Interspersed throughout the festivities are the tunes Lennon and McCartney penned.  If you want to soak up different arrangements of a myriad of songs you already know and love, it's as easy as clicking and buying.<br /><br />John and George we miss you!<br /><br />Enjoy the music and be well,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"the tunes Lennon and McCartney penned.

B0002XMF5I|1.0|Sometime in the early 80's there were rumours about Black Sabbath's new singer being Ian Gillan. We all laughed. We should have cried. Being full of anticipation I bought Born Again, but having listened to it, I was so sorry. I really tried to like it. Ian Gillan singing with Black Sabbath. What could go wrong? But all I was, was a sorry teenager having wasted what little money I had. It didn't sound like Black Sabbath at all. In my opinion the sound is too sharp edged and flat. All about the production seems rushed and the lyrics are really silly. And Gillan's way of singing doesn't fit the music at all. It actually feels a bit odd listening to Gillan singing while Iommi's riffing. Unfortunately this must be one of the least enjoyable recordings by any of the participants. Consider buying something else by Black Sabbath or Deep Purple, like all albums featuring Ozzy and Gillan in respective band.
0743289684|5.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's autobiography is a stunning look into the very roots of Islam, African unrest and the failure of the West's dalliance with multiculturalism - as demonstrated by her emigration to the Netherlands.  Ms. Ali grew up in the very heart of the present conflict in Africa.  Her matter of fact prose describes at times a troubling and beautiful family life.  Her support of her extended clan and the connectedness described in her book are heartwarming.  The sequence in which she suffers forced female circumcision is terrifying to read.<br /><br />The real worth of this book is in journeying with Ms. Ali in her slow discovery of the contradictions and failings of Islam, as it exists in her world.  This is a world in which families still practice honor killings, arranged marriages and isolation among other cultures in which they live.  The West has applied a civilized lens to a faith which has not fundamentally changed since its creation in 600AD.  This \\"rosy view\\" is stripped away thoroughly by Ms. Ali, particularly once she arrives in the Netherlands seeking asylum.<br /><br />The book reads well.  The connection to current events is easily understood and her perspective of a voyage of self discovery, including the related events within her family, make the story poingantly human.  I felt I could identify with the family, friends and teachers she described in her work.  Even those individuals who perpetuated the most horrible acts against her or her family had a distincly human cast.<br /><br />If you wish to understand the present struggle by Islam against the modern world, read this book.  Once you have, pass it along to someone else.  It is a perspective which needs to be understood thoroughly.

0553573403|3.0|THE ARGUMENT (Part I of \\"The Bad\\")<br /><br />Somewhere out there in the wide world of entertainment, there is an author that can pull-off no clich&eacute;s, complete originality and a nice good foundation from history without getting overtly obsessed with it. George RR Martin is, sadly, not that person. There is a line between where it is very realistic yet bearable fantasy and, on the other side, WAY TOO REALISTIC! For that matter Martin's sequence (A Song of Ice and Fire) is somewhere just a tad bit (at some points, at others really, really far) over the metre onto the WAY TOO REALISTIC! part. Gory violence, disgusting \\"interactions\\", and vile language are a big part of the book. I'm pretty sure that his originality is because half of the thing is borrowed from the TV-MA shows on HBO (Rome, Deadwood etc.)!<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />His writing is crisp, sensible and flows well. It is also written like someone would back in the 1000s (without the thees, thous and thys that is). His action when not gory is well-written and doesn't get smashed up in your head like those in Shannara and Goodkind.  I like his characters (the reason I read these books) who are:<br />1. Funny,<br />2. Likeable (with the exception of those from the Iron Islands),<br />3. Understandable<br /><br />THE BAD (Part Two: Writing-wise)<br /><br />If you are a history geek (like me, sort of) you can basically follow the plotline after the first hundred pages or so to DIRECTLY down the route of the War of the Roses. This is annoying because you can predict what's going to happen. Second, even though everybody says that he \\"Kills off a bunch of characters\\" he doesn't. I can think of three who've died and I've read all four books.<br /><br />THE PLOT<br /><br />Is unexplainable in words.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATIONS<br /><br />If you like this series, read these books:<br />* The Malazan Book of the Fallen Series by Steven Erickson<br />* Prince of Nothing series by R. Scott Bakker<br />* Anything by JRR Tolkien
B00005JOFQ|4.0|Well, after 1000 reviews, who needs my opin ion? I'm simply a country boy who took this film to heart, sadly know a few men whose lives are/were like this, even today. But as a film itself, it's a wonderfully simple, plaintive accomplishment.  <br />  <br />I didn't have a problem understanding Heath's mumbled \\"ennis\\" accent. It's an all-too familiar tone from uptight men who can't  open their hearts.  <br />  <br />The massive hype and hoopla of this film having settled down, perhaps the viewing public will someday see the other hundreds of films with gay characters; granted, not all better, but more uplifting, and not so predictably tragic.  <br />  <br />A nice film, based on a great short story. But when ever gay actors will be able to do as much, that'd be nice.  <br />  <br />Can you imagine white actors playing African-Americans who suffer oppression? No.  <br />  <br />Well, then, why does it have to be the same for gay cinema?  <br />  <br />Who knows. anyway, not much special in the DVD. widescreen is the only way to see it, for the cinematography.  <br />  <br />I liked watching it in Spanish, too.

B000696PWC|1.0|Don't buy it. I would give it zero stars if there were a zero option.  The music is good, but the manufacturer encoded the cd's with a custom music player.  You CANNOT use your own mp3/cd player.  Why these idiots went to this trouble is beyond human reason. These aren't rocket science secrets, it's MUSIC PEOPLE!  I was never so frustrated trying to listen to these cd's.  It FORCES you to install their own player, which has some privacy and other software warnings.  I immediately uninstalled it.  Don't buy it.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I'm going to write a lot so skip this if you hate reading, but I'd advise not. Read it and get a good opinion on an even better band.    Before last year I'd never really heard of Rise Against. One of my guy friends would always sing the screaming parts of Ready to Fall, and I loved it, but I never knew who sung it. During one of my long searches for interesting music on here I came across this cd. I sampled Ready to Fall and right away I knew the song. I bought it just because of that. And I love it. since then I've gotten more of Rise Against's cd's and I still don't understand why they aren't more famous. Their music, if you could say that punk  could be, is beautiful. it's really attention grabbing and addictive.    The songs are different than past albums, but they are more matture in some way, still political, but it's more hidden in the songs, it's not as direct as in Siren Song of the Counter Culture.    I'm not gunna rate the songs because that would be my opinion. I'm reviewing the songs as if I don't care about the music and I'm just here to review it.(though I really love it and I'm trying really hard to give you an honest opinion, but hey don't kill me if I make them sound a little better than they really are)    1.CHAMBER IN THE CARTRIDGE-This song is a great opener for the album. The beginning is really different **This is noise**...and then the guitar starts. It adds a really interesting effect and makes you somewhat interested. The beginning guitar kind of drags on a bit, but the lyrics finally start. Throughout the rest of the song the lyrics are pretty much the chorus and a few verses, but nothing too out of the ordinary. There's the hidden political view in this song if you listen.    2.INJECTION-The guitar in the beginning catches your attention and the lyrics are really well written. Because almost everyone can relate to something he sings throughout the entire song. It's a **oh, i know what thats like** sort of feeling throughout the song. Thelyrics stand out more than the guitar in most of this song. They don't overpower it, but you focus more on his voice.    3.READY TO FALL-The albums first single. It's a catchy song. The lyrics are really simple, but in a good way. Not too simple but well though out. The guitar blends in with the singing during the chorus which makes his voice stand out. Nothing is really special about the song(like an awesome solo or insane guitars or drumming), but the way Rise Against put the music and the lyrics together make this song really stand out. It's addicting to listen to because it's repetitive in a good way.    4.BRICKS-For only 1:30 long this song is a standout one. From the beginning the guitars and drums are fast. A pure straight up punk fast song that makes you want to get up and start a fire and riot during the song. The lyrics too, and on to it's pure punk feeling, adding its politicalness slightly, and it would go unnoticed if not listened to and accepted.    5.UNDER THE KNIFE-From the start of the song you know it's going to be a good one. The opening riff is catchy. The chorus(guitar part) has part of the intro in it which keeps the song alive (though the lyrics could by themselves). Again the guitar stands out with pounding drums and a thrundering bass to go along with it.    6.PRAYER OF THE REFUGEE-The beginnig with the guitar and bass is captivating. it catches your attention, because this song doesn't start out as heavy as the others. It gradually builds up to it with a scream along worthy chorus. Throughout the rest of the song after the chorus the music starts to keep its usual punky heaviness and about 3/4 of the way through slow down to the beginning riff and immedietly go into the loud chorus.     7.DRONES-Picks up from the ending of Prayer of the Refugee and kicks up from there. With a raging bass and drum beginning and a screaming guitar slide whats not to like about it? The lyrics are very catchy and you know you can relate to them when you have those \\"days\\" and want someone there for you. The guitar, bass and drums continute to rage with the beginning heaviness for the rest of the song. Again the hinting politicalness in the song(I'm not saying that's a bad thing. It's great that they can express politics through music. Its a talent and I love it.).    8.THE APPROACHING CURVE-They tell a story, which is a great addition to the album, and they don't do a bad job either. This song is captivating you get sucked into it. The girls vocals in the background(very quietly) was different, but a great addition to the song. It makes it more addicting and true if you relate. The guitars, bass and drums make a melody that go along with the song perfectly making the song something you could really lose yourself in and just focus on the song.    9.WORTH DYING FOR-The drums immediatly start in the beginning which makes a great entrance to a good song. The lyrics are very well written and go great with the album and everything going on in the world right now. The guitar througout is fast, like the drums and bass and make the song worth listening to because they add fastness and an addicting touch(though the lyrics help out so much). Speaking of the lyrics, they make the song so much better and add emotion to it.    10.BEHIND CLOSED DOORS-The singing and guitar make a perfect beginning for this song. You can relate to the lyrics and you could defniitally see a solider sing this song during war **we will survive**...The guitar and drums, bass too throughout the rest of the song is exceptional and keeps you hanging, like the lyrics. With pauses at the end of lines during some of the verse parts it adds a great effect of suspense. All in all this song is a good one and fits this album like the plastic cover the cd comes in.    11.ROADSIDE-I guess you could call this the Swing Life Away of The Sufferer And the Wittness. Somewhat slower and acoustic than all of the other songs. Here the girl singing is much louder than the occasional whisper in The Approaching Curve. It's a great addition to the song seeing that it's already different. So many people know what he feels while singing in the song. The guitar is the thing that really stands out over the drums(if hardly any) and bass(if it plays a little), but the lyrics overpower all of that with emotion.    12.THE GOOD LEFT UNDONE-The Guitar in the beginning again catches your attention. The vocals with the flower are different from any other song on this album which makes it unique. The vocals in gemeral are very good, the lyrics, well written and catchy, while the guitar and bass play on in harmony making an awesome rythm to the song as the drums play a great beat you practially want to air drum out. Then the ending, you think the song has changed, but it hasn't ans ends completly differently which keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for that last song.    13.SURVIVE-The guitar immediatly starts out heavy with matching drums. Perfect. A heavy punk song at the end of the album to add the finishing touches. The vocals you want to sing along with they're so catchy while the guitar and drums pour out their hearts giving it their best to be awesome. They got it. With the vocals, the well written lyrics, and and greatly put together music, Survive is the perfect ending track to an already well put together album.      THATS IT!! If you're an old Rise Against fan you'll definately appriciate their new album, though different. If you're a new fan you'll love the new and enjoy the old as well. All in all, buy this album, you won't be disapointed with it if you're a punk-hardcoreish fan.     Rise Against is a band to want to jump up and down and just straight up rock out to.

You really feel the results and all the right muscles are worked to get you ready for a summer of less clothing :) I am in good physical condition and workout to various intense DVDs combined with running and this still is challenging for me to finish. So glad I got it again.  Love, love, love it!

B000PKG6TE|5.0|The angst expressed by several reviewers is an indication of the rabid following for this band.  I see this as a good thing.  Two days ago I would have had no review to write, because it would have simply parroted that angst.    But now I have listened to this album at least four times in different settings.  First of all, it is not much of a departure from all the others in that at first listen it is uneven and maybe somewhat bewildering (even for fans who \\"get them\\").  Second, this is, individually, Homme's most impressive effort.  He's the heartbeat of the band, and I'll simply refer to the controversy in this space over Lanegan's contribution (or lack of it) as evidence of Homme's growth on this album.  I also assumed it was Lanegan on stellar tracks \\"Make It Wit Chu\\" and \\"River in the Road,\\" and these tracks on first listen were the saving grace of the album for me.  Homme is not merely mimicking Lanegan - those are his songs.    I love all of the other QOTSA albums, but upon repeat listens I must say this is the most consistent effort to date.  Turns out Lullabies, which hinted at a mainstream breakthrough attempt, was a prelude to the ability to craft a solid album through and through.  However, (again) on repeat listens, the grit is still there.      \\"Sick, Sick, Sick\\" is getting airplay, and so may \\"I'm Designer\\" and \\"Suture Up Your Future.\\"  But do yourself a favor and check out the real standout tracks: \\"Into the Hollow\\", \\"Make It Wit Chu\\", \\"3's & 7's\\", \\"River in the Road,\\" and a true throwback, \\"Run, Pig, Run.\\"
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Ten minutes or more of previews, and the viewer is \\"prohibited\\" from fast-forwarding, even though the option to do so is stated on the disk.  Who makes these decisions?  I would not have bought the disk had I known.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Its a shame that these films came out in such close proximity as now nearly every reviewer (including this one) links one to the other.  The Prestige is the far better film in nearly every way...The acting is excellent (with the exception of David Bowie and his ridiculous Russian accent), the structure fantastic--I love films like this that jump back and forth between events and time periods as long as the jumps are done so purposefully and not just to be \\"artistic\\" and Nolan does a very good job at this.  The tone was dark without being overbearing.  The film also does a nice job of toying with the audiences emotions, making you root for one character one minute and then against the same character the next.  One of the more intelligent and enjoyable films from '06 that I have seen...
1594489505|4.0|This book was good--but it was not nearly as good as The Kite Runner.  Had I not read and loved The Kite Runner, I may not have had such high expectations for A Thousand..., but I did, and it did not live up.  I liked the book, I read the whole thing in 2 sittings, and it was a solid book, but I kind of feel like it was written using a \\"formula plot\\" similar to The Kite Runner's.  The characters weren't as alive for me, perhaps due to the 3rd person narration rather than first.  And they didn't get my sypmathy like Amir and Hassan did.  Oh well.  Pick it up and read it yourself; maybe you will love it.
B00009L1UP|5.0|One of the BEST rock albums of ALL time.  Empire is an excellently performed and engineered album.

An EXCELLENT album!
0385340559|5.0|I first read Jack Reacher a year ago (the terrific \\"One Shot\\"), then made my way through a few more to kill off a fun summer of reading. I think the last one I read was \\"Echo Burning\\" and by that time, I was a little burned myself - Reacher was just too clever, too good at sensing red herring clues.. he was beating the bad guys with such ease I knew it was time for a separation.<br />So after 7-8 months and a brand new book, I roared through \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\", have given Reacher a new batch of artistic licenses, and the appetite is whetted for more.<br />For anyone who hasn't tried him, this Lee Child guy can flat-out write a story that is smart (I learn something new in every book) and current and has a character that rivals Travis McGee and (the early) Spenser for being a man's man, a ladies' man and just a damned fun read.
B00067BBQE|5.0|Forget about what some people think about the video editing. The music is hard driving and intense. The video of the live performance needs to reflect the music. I know some people just want to watch Amy Lee the whole time but that's not what it's about.   For the moeny you get the live concert version of many great Ev songs, live concert videos and lots of behind-the-scenes footage. My wife, who doesn't even like Ev enjoyed the behind the scenes parts.   It's well worth it.
0385340559|1.0|I'm only a third through the book, and I'm a die hard Jack Reacher fan, however, this will be the last one I will probably buy.  In the first third of the book he has bashed Christians and promoted PETA.  Unlike the author, I was actually in the military and am currently a cop, with everything from undercover narcotics to SWAT under my belt.  I have yet to meet any cops or military that would bash the Bible and promote PETA.  So from now on I'll be reading his books in the bookstore and not buying them.
B0000DZ3HM|5.0|I seen the first track on You Tube, The track called \\" Cantelope Island \\" and immediately knew that this was a must have item.  When I watched  the rest of the DVD and it's music, it may have been a great buy for the price. There was a great mix of  musicians, taking their solos, and putting lots of feeling into it.  There were quite a few long tracks of  music, which I especially like as everyone gets the opportunity to do  their thing
B000AOJ9X0|4.0|The first six tracks off of Buddy Guy's \\"Bring 'Em In\\" explode out of your speakers like a rocket ship -- fitting for a guitarist who continues to soar at an age when most strummers tend to lower their volume.     If \\"Sweet Tea,\\" Buddy's much-heralded previous album, was the raw, tortured sound of an ancient bluesman wrestling with the devil and evil women, his latest release finds him in sunnier spirits -- sort of.    He's still ruing lost loves, of course, both on the opening track, \\"Now You're Gone,\\" and later on with the anxious \\"Somebody's Been Sleeping In My Bed.\\" But then he's off like a hound dog, attacking Wilson Pickett's \\"Ninety Nine and One Half\\" and \\"What Kind of Woman Is This\\" with incredible fire. Both songs are filled with grooves from a bygone era and worth multiple listens.    Razor-sharp solos cut through most of the songs, including the rollicking \\"On A Saturday Night\\" and the Carlos Santana joint wah-wah fest that is \\"I Put A Spell On You.\\"    The second half of the album regretfully meanders. A duet with Tracy Chapman on \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\" inexplicably fails to catch fire, and Buddy clearly stumbles on a mawkish cover of \\"Lay Lady Lay\\" and \\"I've Got Dreams to Remember.\\" Minor quibbles, though. Buddy's inviting us in for a jam session, and it would foolish to turn him down.
B000P2A256|5.0|This has got to be one of the best CD's of the year so far.  So what if it's not Songs About Jane, it's not supposed to be and to anyone who thought it as going to be, get over it please.  I'm not saying they are anything close to U2 but if \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" sounded anything like \\"Joshua Tree\\", would you have been happy about it?  I seriously doubt it.  I think it's an awesome CD which allows us to see how they have grown in almost 6 years.  For those who've tried to compare \\"Kiwi\\" to anything Prince made, no, try again!  A few faves on this album would be \\"Back at Your Door\\",\\"Little of Your Time\\", and \\"Story\\" which was the bonus track if you got the disc from Circuit City and downloaded it.  I appreciate how Maroon 5 gave their fans something else to love them for rather than another version of Songs About Jane.  The album didn't go platinum just because.  It's actually great!
B000GFLAI0|4.0|If i could play with a rockingly beautiful understated band like this when i was around 66 year old-i would be happy as. Have a close listen to the lyrics on this album. They are still fresh. Like his Chronicles book, they just flow in his way. When he wants to rock, Tracks 1-5-9 The Band kicks Hard. This album Grows, so listen motre than once. Keep on the road Bob-Like Keith Richards, just play till you leave this planet and we shall find you again in the afterlife.<br />Thunder on the Mountain is one of the best songs Dylan has EVER penned. And the Band Rock it Beautifully
B000M4RG4C|1.0|I am not sure if anyone else saw this film the same way but I took it as a 90 minute Anti-War film with 15 minutes of battle scenes. Why was there so much time put into having the wrong names of the Marines who raised the flag on the island and the government covering it up? This point seem to be thrown out at you all throughout the film when there was on need for it. It should have been stated to set the record straight and then not brought up again. If they wanted to really honor the Marines they should have focused more on the events that took place during the battle, not the politics of the tour to increase the sale of War Bonds. Also the movie jumped around far too much. The son of one of the Marines who raised the flag was interviewing individuals who were on the island with flashbacks to the tour in the US for War Bonds who had flashbacks of the fighting which took place on the island. Too much time was wasted trying to figure out who was talking to who and at what point in time it was taking place. Someone should have watched \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" instead of \\"Pearl Harbour\\" before making this film. We have had enough anti-war talk from Hollywood. When is it going to stop? Don't waste your time with this movie, there are better films out there that honor the men and women who have fought for this country. Films like \\"The Longest Day\\" come to mind.
0753820250|5.0|I just finished reading this most brilliant novel and I am sad to bid it farewell.  And, although the prose is literature of a very high level, it had an unusual bonus feature of reading like a page-turner.  I simply could not put it down!  At every spare moment available to me, I picked it up and poured myself into the book and loved every bit of it.  This was one of the most deeply satisfying books I have read and I have wholeheartedly recommended it to my friends and my family.
0060989157|4.0|If you are a rocker then you must read this book. They leave nothing out and it opens yours eyes to just what kind of life these crazy people live. This is much better than Tommyland. Much better. If offends, it makes you think and it makes you realize that you may not have been nearly as bad as you thought you were when you were sneaking off with your friends to catch that elusive buzz. I was an angel compared to these dudes, and believe me....I left my mark, but compared to these lunatics Mother Tereasa would have made me Saint Carol of Chesterfield.  Read it, just for the kicks and to make yourself feel a whole lot less like a loser. It sure can't hurt and it is good for a laugh. If you have a pool and a free afternoon then hit the ABC store, drag out your lounge chair and whatever gets you through the Munchies and enjoy an afternoon of pure raunchhy decadence. Everyone needs to get away from the real world for awhile, so why not spend it in Motley Crew's World? You will come out of it smelling like a Rose.
0316010669|4.0|Great audiobook, and I think perfect for that medium. I like to hear the inflection an author gives the work, and Gladwell read well.  Gladwell also excels at story weaving -- starting an example, giving more information/research, then more story, then more information/research, then concluding the story.    There are a lot of people I want to recommend read this book--my brother for the Marine who won the war game thing (reminds me a lot of an uncle), my friend the auggie cop for the story of the cops who shot Diallo. I was personally fascinated by the study of facial expressions and musculature and would love to read more about that.    But the shortcoming of this book is that it doesn't really help one be more blink-ful, or blink-wise. It isn't a self-help book. There is also research in the book that I don't particularly buy the premise of, such as that having trouble categorizing disparate things into falsely dichotomous categories reveals culturally ingrained biases.    But it is a fascinating listen, engaging, and I'll be looking for anything else he has written for his style is terrific.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|What a great cast--- Leo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, Mark Wahlberg, Jack Nicholson....they are all just awesome and give superior performances. It's a thriller, a game of cat and mouse in which a Boston mob moss is trying to use his infiltrator on the police force to find out the identity of the officer who has gone undercover and infiltrated the mafia. It is a thriller that keeps you going till the very end and I did NOT expect the ending.     You must see this movie. I've seen Martin Scorsese's other films but this one triumphs as the best one so far. Thank goodness he won an Oscar for it, it deserved it!!
B000L212HC|5.0|Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan proves his skill as a director yet again in this thriller full of grudges, backstabbing, and magic. I don't want to spoil anything, but I'll just say this: this is a movie where about half-way through, you realize the story might go anywhere! It's got an amazingly twisty plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and the actors all deliver amazing performances. With magicians like David Blane and Criss Angel making waves on television, I think now was as good a time as ever to release this kind of movie. This is such a good thriller, it almost makes up for how disappointing M. Night Shymilan's \\"Lady in the Water\\" was, because it more than fills the gap.    The Blu-Ray itself is a true visual feast as well. It's got amazing black levels and color contrast that images seemed to pop off the screen, even on my crappy old 1080i-only set through component cables. This is definitely a great movie to play when you want to show off your Blu-Ray player or new TV!
B000LC55F2|4.0|The only other movie I've seen Christian Bale in was \\"Royal Deceit\\" with Gabriel Byrne made several years ago. He's quite a good actor and of course you can't miss with Michael Caine and Hugh Jackman. I just loved the way these two illusionist/magicians tried to outdo one another. The ending surprised me though and that's the reaction a good movie should have on you!  Not going to go into intricate plot details, all I can say is that if you enjoy drama and suspense, this movie is certainly it.
0785814531|5.0|What can I really say here?  A book of this magnitude is hard to really review because there is so much to comment on it's almost better to comment on nothing but the emotional pull of the work in general.  So, with that thought in mind I'll do that very thing.  Edgar Allan Poe is one of the darkest writers known to man, but on the upswing he may very well be one of the most influential and overall the most insightful.  Reading any of the selected work in this collection (ranging from masterful short stories to some of the most brilliantly crafted poems written) will open a door to another world, a world that lives in each and every one of us, a dark world that we shun for fear of understanding.  Poe brilliantly connects us to that world.<br /><br />Poe is often referred to for his horror, stories like `The Tell Tale Heart' or `The Black Cat' set a precedent for what we've come to expect from his work, but it's not limited and that's where the pure joy in unexpected gems lies in waiting.  Poems like the beautifully written `Annabelle Lee', a tragic story of love and loss, showcase a side to Poe, that while still maintaining a dark edge comes off softer and more heartfelt.  It's almost so beautiful its anti-Poe.<br /><br />Like I've mentioned, there is so much here it's hard to narrow down the must reads.  There are just so many here.  Every poem and story are classic in their own way and deserve our attention.  As some have already commented on, this is not a collection to breeze through or take in all at once.  It's too abrasive and may come across drastic and or blunt.  It's better to take it piece by piece and really allow the brilliance that was this tortured soul shine through with each passage.<br /><br />Edgar Allan Poe still today proves to be an inspiration for many recent writers, and his influence can be seen in many of the most praised, hailed and cherished a manuscript, but the truth remains that there is only one Edgar Allan Poe, and while writers of today have their own unique twists and assets, an imitation of the predecessor at times is nothing more than an imitation.  Poe was the real thing, a genius of the written word and it's tragic that he left before his time was through, but he stays with us through collections like this that capitalize on everything that was great and awe-inspiring about a man who lived darker than the rest of us, not because he was that much more removed from the rest of us but because he knew how to embrace the very darkness that lies in us all.ue twists and assets, an imitation of the predecessor at times is nothing more than an imitation.

B000E6GBV2|5.0|EATT was my favorite album of 2006.  BoH is so much better than MMJ it's ridiculous.
B000BW7QWW|2.0|I like Sci-Fi - Stargate, Battlestar, etc. A friend suggested I watch Firefly. Got the first DVD, could barely finish the episodes. Boring! So incredibly slow. The premise is okay though. So when I found out they made a movie, I checked it out. If you like the idea of the tv show but can't bare to watch it, try Serenity. It sums up the entire idea and reaches a conclusion without wasting all of your time.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This series is incredible! It looks beautiful on our HDTV!! (keep in mind this will ONLY play using a HD DVD player). We used our XBox 360 add-on and it looks fantastic! It's very clear that the high-tech equipment and five years it took to make this happen was all worth while. As someone who loves nature and travel, I loved being able to see places I've not yet been.     This is the version of the series released in Great Britain and narrated by David Attenborough. So, as long as you don't mind the occasional land mass comparisons to England and Wales and temperatures given in celsius, you will thoroughly enjoy these DVDs. Most of the content is very family friendly and educational. There are some predator pursuit scenes that could be a little intense for young eyes, so you might want to preview it before showing your children. Otherwise, you will not be disappointed at all.
B00005JPCF|5.0|George Miller's animated film, \\"Happy Feet,\\" is a visual wonder and accomplishes the same feat as Baz Luhrman's \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" by deftly weaving popular songs into the plot of the movie.  But please note, the title and the fact that the movie features beyond-cute penguins belie the fact that this is a more grown-up cartoon that earns its PG rating - this is not G-rated family fare for kiddies of all ages.    \\"HF\\" focuses on emperor penguins, and Miller pays an obvious tribute to \\"March of the Penguins\\" in the opening scenes.  Memphis (Hugh Jackman) falls in love with Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) and they have an egg.  Norma Jean then heads off for the fishing grounds, leaving Memphis with the egg through the long cold winter night - a scene that the movie creates with dazzling artistry.  Tragedy nearly strikes when Memphis drops his egg for a few seconds - anyone who has seen \\"March\\" knows that a few instants can be fatal.  Memphis is gravely worried that his instant of inattention has cost his family dear.    But all appears well when Mumble (Elijah Wood) hatches . . . but then he starts tap-dancing.  Memphis tries to help Mumble hide this odd quirk (penguins are a rigid society), but everything comes clear when Mumble proves that he absolutely cannot sing.  This is a big sin in emperor penguin land, as every emperor penguin has a \\"heart song,\\" and without it, you can never find a mate.  Mumble can't sing, but he can dance like Savion Glover (who provides the dancing).  Still, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), the best-singing penguin Mumble's age, won't have him because he can't sing, and Mumble is ostracized.    What follows is a wild ramble for Mumble.  He encounters dangerous leopard seals and meets new friends, some Latino penguins who aren't so hung-up on singing.  Ultimately, Mumble learns that the fishing problems plaguing the penguins (the fish are mysteriously disappearing) are not blamed on the penguins' lack of devotion to their ways, but the depredations of aliens (i.e., man).  So what begins as a musical romp turns into a powerful environmental message-film.      And powerful it is.  I first saw \\"HF\\" with my four-year old daughter in the Omnimax format, and many adults were shedding tears by the end of the movie.  This is serious stuff, but I have to admit that my daughter was also riveted by the movie despite its near two-hour length.      Look for more mature humor - this is more like \\"Shrek\\" than \\"Toy Story.\\"      All in all, \\"HF\\" is one of the best animated films to come out in recent years, and that's saying something as we are seeing more and more animated movies than ever before.  It's a little dark for some kids, so you should probably watch it with your kids the first time to make sure that it's OK.  But the good news is that you will enjoy Mumble's journey and probably have some explaining to do with your kids about man's siphoning of the penguin's fish.  An excellent film.
B000NVIXDW|2.0|I love Michael's other two Cds so I went ahead and bought this without really hearing any of the songs.    The end result? I like ONE song and that isn't even something I love.    The Best is Yet to Come is Ok. Same with \\"It had Better be Tonight\\".    I can't say how much I dislike the harmony that Boyz II Men do on \\"Comin' Home Baby\\". What are they doing on Michael Buble's album????    \\"Lost\\" is too slow and lacks the power of something like \\"Home\\"    \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" isn't one of my favorite songs, so there you go.    \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" would have been alright if it had just been Michael Buble but it is a duet with Ivan Lins so half of it is in Portuguese and it just doesn't flow the same way.    \\"Everything\\" is the song I like but it isn't noteworthy enough to make the CD worth it.    \\"Always on my Mind\\" is too slow and too bland. Elvis' version is slow but so sincere and powerful. In my opinion Michael ruins the song. (I never thought I would say that.)    \\"That's Life\\" has a Gospel Choir....???? It just doesn't fit.    And Good Grief, \\"Dream\\" is supposed to be slow but it isn't supposed to be torture to listen to!    I was really dissapointed with this CD. I see though, that I am in a minority. That's Ok. I plan on ridding myself of this CD, listen to the other 2 and hope the the \\"Best\\" is still \\"yet to come.\\"
B0009A40ES|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. Christian Bale drew me in when I first saw this movie. Every movie he is in, he always seems to be on top of his game. Sure some of his movie havent been all too great, yet he still puts on a hell of a show. I love the book as well, which is more explict then this. Its a great move.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I like all the songs and think that Hugh is great singing, also Haley!
B000GCFO0I|1.0|The film is like House of Wax; Nice set but the only real thing that stuck out from this so called \\"horror\\" film. It is a good mystery movie but its just too long. Alot of the movie could have been trimmed down. The ending looked like the guy stole it from Hellraiser. The video game for this must be a very boring video game.
B000N3ST9I|2.0|If you want to hear through the ashes... with great solo guitar you should get this album, but what makes this album get 2 star from me is after the song title \\"now i lay thee down\\" you only get song that sound sooo nu metal, yes i only like the first three song from this album, man this album is dissapointing me
B00005OAIE|5.0|I love his song \\"No Such Thing\\" because its upbeat and keeps your head bobbing. This guy makes me want to scream on top of my lungs!!!!
B000OCXMAE|1.0|Man i cannot believe linkin park sounding like this just listen the song like leave out all the rest, shadow of the day, in between, in pieces, the little thing give you away, those song??? how can they picked them up.    and the funniest thing is when you hear hands held high this song should be in fort minor album not linkin park, and you will know from this album that guys from linkin park is so confuse about their bands in the future, what should this band sounds like, this album is way out of the line man    but i still give this album 1 star bcuz there's track tittle given up and what i've done.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|If you loved Hybrid Theory, Reanimation and Meteora, this Album will leave you wondering why in the world did they change their awesome ways! They say in the Album that they wrote this Album for themselves and when you are an artist you do your album for YOUR FANS! This is garbage! Do not buy this, nothing stands out nothing.  Im very let down by this.
B000022TSW|5.0|This movie was hillarious from start to finish. They talked about some stuff that didn't really make sense to me but the rest was funny. South Park fans will laugh there F****** A**'s off. If you love the show you will love this movie. South Park is the best animated comedy ever.
0385333846|5.0|This book is a true masterpiece.  It is the best thing Kurt Vonnegut ever wrote, in terms of classic literature.  Some of his other stuff is more meaningful to me, but Slaughterhouse Five is the best put together, most literarily valuable book that he wrote.  It's also his first book.<br /><br />It was years after I read this book that I realized that this book may not be science fiction at all.  It may just be a depiction of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Slaughterhouse Five stands up very well as either an interesting book on time travel or a book on how the horrors of war can ravage the mind of an innocent man.  Billy Pilgrim, the main character, did get \\"unstuck in time in 1944.\\"<br /><br />I really like the part in the book where Billy Pilgrim is first married to his wife Valencia.<br /><br />Now he rolled off his huge wife...He was rich now.  He had been rewarded for marrying a girl nobody in his right mind would have married...<br />\\"I never thought anyone would marry me.\\"<br />\\"Um,\\" said Billy Pilgrim<br />\\"I'm going to lose weight for you,\\" she said.<br />\\"What?\\"<br />\\"I'm going to go on a diet.  I'm going to become beautiful for you.\\"<br />\\"I like you just the way you are.\\"<br />\\"Do you really?\\"<br />\\"Really,\\" said Billy Pilgrim.  He had already seen a lot of their marriage, thanks to time travel, knew that it was at least going to be bearable all of the way.
B00009RAJJ|5.0|I bought the original double album back in 1979 (I was a Junior in High School) and had mix emotions when I first listened to it.  Lindsey's music was a neurotic mess, while Christine's was too slow and boring and Stevie was becoming more elusive than ever!  Well I was wrong and now it's a complete masterpiece of a band during its hiatus and trying to keep it all together.  I still argue thou that it sounds like all 3 band members recorded their first solo albums with Tusk instead of as a band.
0553588486|5.0|There are many, many reviews for this book already; I just wanted to add my 5 star to the mix.  This series is amazing.  I really enjoy the character chapter style.  A long read but well worth it.
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|I have loved Rihanna since Music of the Sun because of her style, voice and especially for her Caribbean influence that set her apart from all the others.

B000FS9FCQ|1.0|Anyone who believes in the right of a creator to control that which he creates should not watch this film, pure and simple.    Alan Moore, the literary genius who wrote the spectacular graphic novel on which this mediocre action picture was based stated on numerous occasions that he did not approve of this adaptation of his work, that the work essentially \\"got it wrong\\" and missed the point of his book, and that he did not want to be associated with the film.    Since he said it better than I can, I'll quote him below:    \\"[The movie] has been \\"turned into a Bush-era parable by people too timid to set a political satire in their own country.... It's a thwarted and frustrated and largely impotent American liberal fantasy of someone with American liberal values standing up against a state run by neoconservatives--which is not what the comic V for Vendetta was about. It was about fascism, it was about anarchy, it was about England.\\" (from an interview of Alan Moore on MTV, 8-30-06)      The bottom line is that the Wachowskis and Silver took one of the most complex and intelligent books about dystopia, man's interaction with the state and the easy slide from democracy to fascism and turned it into a dumb action picture and low-watt paranoid liberal rant ala Air America, and I say that as a liberal.    If you want an intelligent, complex story, buy [[ASIN:0930289528 V for Vendetta]].    If you want \\"knife time,\\" dorky alliteration, anti-conservative paranoia, anti-religious paranoia and a nice pat on the back for voting for Kerry last time round, buy this movie.
B000PTYP5C|3.0|I love DT but this cd was disappointing. It seems like they just wanted to knock out a cd and get it over with. I am glad Petrucci decided to go a little harder on this cd.

1891252089|5.0|David was very conscious of making this book user friendly and he certaintly accomplished that goal.  First of all there is the spiral bound spine, which is beautifully covered on the outside with stardard book cover, yet perfect for putting it flat on the floor during practice.  The book has both the primary and intermediate series.  Each pose comes jammed packed with modifications to meet varing degrees of flexiblity.    There are explanations about Ashtanga Yoga and practice as well as some of the philosphy beyond this traditional.  This book is primary for the practice of asana so much more than getting into mediation or chakra or chanting, for that I suggest you pick up Power Yoga by Berly Bender Birch.  The photographs are in black & white obviously to keep production costs down, but no matter its beautifully done and truly inspiring.    Hats off to Swenson and his team for putting much thought into the creation and execution of this book,
B000OW8DW6|5.0|i had wanted to see this movie from the time i heard an early review proclaiming it as, \\"a modern day bladerunner.\\"  that comparison is debatable, as this movie stands on its own.    twists, turns, surprises, and a dying earth depicted in a decayed UK.  this is one of those movies that you cannot get out of your head for days or even a week followings its first viewing.  the final 45 minutes still haunt me.    human life transcends all political/organizational divides.
0142000655|5.0|Steinbeck can go either way. \\"The Pearl\\" was a disgusting waste of time and paper, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" a fabulous, emotional read, and \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" a fascinating book that totally engaged the reader. Where does \\"East of Eden\\" fit on the Steinbeck-o-meter? At the top.<br /><br />Many readers don't like \\"East of Eden\\" because of its length, its higher level of rambling, and just the overall overload. Then again, this is part of the book. \\"East of Eden\\" IS long. Steinbeck DOES ramble quite often here. But then there's the story, the emotion (and occasionally lack of), and the way hundreds of pages flew by that just bring this book up so high.<br /><br />\\"East of Eden\\" starts out with very difference characters than it ends with, and over time we notice the subtle shift. Granted, most of the book revolves around the same few characters, but they're so interesting and have so much personality that it fits well.<br /><br />There are many biblical themes here (Eden, for starters), but it's not exactly the whole story. Mostly, this is almost like a retelling of classic, ancient stories. There's the tale of brother versus brother, a devil (also known as the deceiving woman), and the miracle. But overall, Eden is an incredible read, a wonderful book, and written in an excellent way. Steinbeck has come a long way since \\"The Pearl\\".<br /><br />This is the ultimate Steinbeck. It's the heaviest, the most intense, and probably (in my opinion) the best. There is so much to it, and it's such a rewarding feeling to read it.<br /><br />An excellent book for any reader! I definitely urge you to read it.
B00006JDSI|5.0|Still the eeriest and most atmospheric of all the Dracula films, Murnau's \\"Nosferatu\\" gave the German director an opportunity to explore experimental visual techniques--like stop-motion and negative exposures--in bringing Bram Stoker's version of the legend to the big screen. But his biggest coup was in casting the mysterious Max Schreck (rumored to be another actor's alias) in the title role. With his rat-like features, ghastly pointed ears, and long, talon-like fingers, Schreck doesn't seem at all like a creature from our planet. Murnau completed the effect by filming on location in Eastern Europe. The result is a Gothic chiller you simply can't miss.
6305922756|5.0|I love the dry humor of this movie. I've been a huge music fan for years and love the way the various scenarios are blown out of proportion. For example, the little bread, big meat catering problem. You'll have to watch the movie to know what I'm talking about. If you need more of an \\"in your face\\" sort of humor, then this movie is not for you.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|One of the most influential films ever made, Lang's \\"Metropolis\\" was inspired by the director's awestruck glimpse of the 1920s Manhattan skyline. Visually astonishing and darkly surreal, \\"Metropolis\\" is a flawless example of German Expressionism on film, with its heavily stylized, futuristic production design, odd camera angles, and bleak, shadowy evocation of the not-so-harmonious techno-industrial future. Rudolf Klein-Rogge is especially captivating playing sadistic capitalist Rotwang, who engineers a slave revolt against the reformers. A hypnotic, enthralling silent masterwork by the legendary director of \\"M\\" and \\"The Big Heat.\\"
B000KLRUJS|5.0|This review will eventually be replaced by more informed, informative reviews. I just wanted to offer a placeholder to tell opera neophytes and curious listeners that this is the latest and surely greatest (sonically) incarnation of Solti's recording of this opera. Gramophone has called it, \\"undoubtedly one of the greatest performances ever on record.\\"    Amazon is still selling the first CD release at a much higher price. This is the one to get. The same is true with Solti's equally estimable recording of Salome.    Happy Listening,  G.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|I have to be honest, I wasn't expecting a steller album after the previous two that some may consider to be a let down (by Dream Theater's standard).  I went ahead an ordered the special edition with the DVD.  After listening to it a couple times, my expectations have been far exceeded.  In the DVD Mike Portnoy says they wanted to create an album that told what Dream Theater was all about.  I believe they have done this without question.  From my perspective, as an album, it takes something from every previous album, from the balads of Images and Words the meaty heavy riffs of Train of Thought.  The result: everything I like about Dream Theater in one album.  The album name itself also is a perfect representation of Dream Theater as Portnoy says in the DVD, ordered chaos.  Every track is memorable from the get go.  Other albums such as their conceptual albums (which I also love) take some listening to before you realize the brilliance, however this album will have you from the first listen.  This release definately has further solidified Dream Theater as my favorite band.  I am looking forward to seeing them in concert in a couple months.  At some previous concerts I've been to (including other bands) where an album just came out, I've wanted them to play more older stuff than new.  Honestly however I would enjoy the concert just as much if they played this whole album, it's that good after listening to it for just a couple times.  Like all other Dream Theater albums I see this one having great re-play value because of the diversity and enourmous depth of songs presented.  This could also be one of thier best introductory alubums for new listeners.  Lastly, make sure you get the bonus DVD edition of the album.  It really shows the brilliance of the workings of the band and has some absolutly hilarious moments.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I had my doubts about this at first. I really did. I wasn't sure if Priest could crank it up and crank it out the way they used to be able to. For any of you who are still on the fence, let me tell ya: this is one hell of a comeback statement. Sure, Priest has been around in name the last 15 years, but after Halford left, the band's sound changed completely. The first three tracks on their own are enough enticement to buy the album. \\"Judas Rising\\" builds from silence into a drum pattern from Scott, and then Glenn, K.K. and Ian literally come thundering in. A tremendous opener. The bass riff on \\"Revolution\\" has a bit of a blues feel to it, but that doesn't stop it from kicking back and rocking out. \\"Angel\\" is a nice little ballad (think recent live versions of \\"Diamonds and Rust\\"). The highlight, for me, is \\"Hellrider.\\" It reminds me of \\"Leather Rebel,\\" which is definitely a good thing. And then we have the closer, \\"Lochness,\\" a 13 and a half minute epic. It doesn't drag, and the chorus is really neat. The verdict: the metal gods are back in full force. Angel of Retribution fails to disappoint.
B000P0J024|5.0|I live that that line a lot.  These albums are what the docter ordered for a breezy autumn day because of there cozy atomsphere and style.  The second one - volume 3 - stinks a little but that is because Roy Orbison died and there is not enough George Harrison.  But there is one song dedicated to Carrie Fisher of Star Wars, called \\"You Took My Breath Away\\" and I think they really sound like they mean it.      There are famous musicians and then there are George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty.  I don't say Jeff Lynne because even though the sucess of ELO, no one still really knows about it.  He hides his face behind a mask of fascial hair that looks really stupid.  Especially for a man his age.  He is the worst singer in the group.    Jim Keltner is a great session drummer who is the drummer on both albums and deserved a \\"wilbury's nickname/alter ego\\" alogn the lines of lucky and so on.  Shame on the group for putting him in the background especially when Roy Orbison was only on one of the two albums and got a special name even though Keltner was on every one of the albums (I think ever track).    As for the songs themselves I have to say that my favorites are \\"Where did you Sleep Last night\\" from Volue 3 and also \\"New Blue Moon\\" from that same album.  \\"She Is My Baby\\" is a real rocker and it features the only part where George Harrison does not play lead guitar, too bad because when I first heard it I thought that it was him.  Oh well his awesome solo on \\"Poor House\\" makes up for it.  On the first volume, I have to say that my favorite is the fun and bouncy \\"Last Night\\" sung mainly by Petty.  I also \\"Handle With Care\\".    What I don't like on the first one is \\"Magarita\\" which is a big waste and just pads the album a little.  I always skip it.  Oh yeah and I don't like \\"Tweeter and the Monkey Man\\" because of the \\"and the walls came down/all the way to h--\\" because it is too gloomy.  But on volume three one of the ones I can't think of the name but Bob Dylan sings it.Something like \\"If She Belonged With Me.\\"      With two records plus a dvd on one package (and I haven't watched the dvd yet) this is one heck of a value.  I recommend it.

B00005JPGO|2.0|The great press touting \\"Blood Diamond\\" led me to expect a film with the depth of insight into the politics and social consequences of the diamond trade that I found when watching \\"Hotel Rwanda.\\"  The latter was chilling in its realism of the international politics connected with this genocide and excellent in portrayal of its characters.      Not so with \\"Blood Diamond.\\" For me, nothing in \\"Blood Diamond\\" redeems the film's failure to depthfully unmask the price paid by everyday African workers for a commodity that we so often use to symbolize the \\"good life\\".     It is a film heavy on bloodshed, threats to survival and brutality.  Characterizations are lightweight.  The African father, in particular, should have been portrayed with a great deal more depth. His character was so obscure and marginalized that there was no preparation for his actions at the film's end.    In short, on all counts -- I was deeply disappointed.  The best I can say of it is that there is plenty of action.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|One of the overlooked comedy classics, with Tom Hanks at his pre-Oscar best and Shelley Long matching him. Snappy writing and great one-liners makes this a movie you'll be quoting often. If you ever do any home improvement project, you'll find yourself muttering, \\"Two weeks!\\" over and over. Also makes a great gag gift for anyone about to buy or renovate a house.<br /><br />Note to Amazon: your internal review has factual errors. A major plot point is that Hanks' and Long's characters are NOT married, and she is not \\"attracted to a long-haired violinist\\" - he is a snobby conductor and her ex-husband, to whom she is NOT attracted anymore. It is difficult to take the reviewer's opinion seriously when he's so far off the mark on basic plot points.
1594489505|5.0|I thought \\"Kite Runner\\" was one of the top ten books I had ever read. Impossible as it seems, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is even higher on my list. It is simply a magnificent novel and a must read.
0786891084|5.0|I was a bit hesitant when I started reading this book because of the e-mail/im/letter format, but it turned out to be interesting and refreshing!  The character development was great and the storyline interesting.  Ahern presented a complex, realistic relationship between the novels two main characters, Rosie and Alex, as well as between Rosie and the other characters in the book.  Ahern really seemed to understand that life can be fun and encouraging as well as dramatic and unpredictable.    I had never read any of Cecelia Ahern's novels before, but now I hope to read the others she has written!

B000GFLE86|5.0|Madeleine's personal problems are all too well known; they may have affected the quantity of her output, but the quality remains superb.<br /><br />  This album is a follow-on to \\"Careless Love\\", and lives up to all of our high expectations. Madeleine is, once again, covering proven winners, and she's so good that she makes them her own. The duet, \\"River\\", with k. d. lang is a particular joy. From her much earlier album, \\"Dreamland\\", Madeleine has shown an equal facility in English and French, which is to be expected, given her years in Paris.<br /><br />  If you want to here jazz done right, don't miss this; the girl can REALLY sing.
B000003C4K|5.0|Exodus, in my opinion, do not get the credit that they deserve. They tend to get overlooked when talking about thrash metal bands, probably because they weren't as well-known as the more influential groups like Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, or Anthrax. However, I like to credit Exodus as being a TRUE thrash metal band through and through. For instance, Metallica changed when the 90s hit. The image, the attitude, the music; they all were altered drastically due to probably fame and popularity. Anthrax and Megadeth as well changed their purposes for rocking, the former mixing rap and metal (yuck) and the latter wanting that #1 spot ever so bad (with Countdown to Extinction) and also making a commercialized pop-metal album called Risk. They were losing their edge, conforming if you will, to the demands of popularity, success, and commercial status.<br /><br />But not Exodus. No, these guys were pure metal dirtbags from their rotted black teeth to their fungus-infected toenails. Never did they falter, never did they conform to the wishes of the media. Exodus' front man for this album, Paul Bailoff, in fact, was probably thee biggest metalhead of thrash, maybe surpassed only by Cliff Burton. His voice, if you've never heard him, is very unique for a thrash singer. He reminds me of Tom Araya from Slayer in the menacing way he presents the vocals and he's also similar to James Hetfield a little, cause he uses that screechy, high-pitched vocal style straight from the throat. The guy would go up to people wearing glam metal shirts, tear `em up, and wear them around his arm like trophies for God's sake; how metal is that? Anyway, this underrated band can not be tossed away like some ratty hair metal t-shirt (whoops). Bonded by Blood is easily a top-10 necessity if you wanna get into thrash metal and will be remembered by thrashers for years to come.<br /><br />Many people deem Exodus' guitar riffs generic and ordinary (most likely for the sole reason of raw production), but truthfully Exodus' riffs have a great deal of substance to them and pack heavy punches. How can any metalhead NOT headbang to the main riff of \\"And Then There Were None\\"? I mean, the first few measures of the riff draw you in tight, but then the pounding drums come in and then you really can't stand still. And of course you got Paul reaching into the bowels of Hell and expressing some real malignant images as well, so really the whole bit's just unadulterated thrash. Oh, and if want catchy riffs just get an earful of the title track, \\"Exodus\\", or a little dose of \\"Piranha\\", which has a brief but driving drum intro, one of my favorite verse riffs that has sort of a Jon Schaffer (from Iced Earth) touch going, and some wicked-a$$ solos which ice the cake.<br /><br />\\"Bonded by Blood\\" not only contains a catchy riff, but the chorus is insanely memorable and a great shout-along, on which Bailoff really delivers. \\"A Lesson in Violence\\" and \\"Metal Command\\" are fast-paced metal blasts with menacing vocals from Paul and driving, in-your-face thrash riffs; both add a great deal to the album. The solo on \\"Metal Command\\" is quite noodly and soaring as well, and the chorus on \\"Lesson in Violence\\" is definitely a highlight.  \\"No Love\\" opens with an acoustic passage showcasing Exodus' classical side, but in no time, another infectious riff creeps up and we have another amazing song on our hands. \\"Deliver Us to Evil\\" is somewhat epic (7:10 long) and is one of the best off the album. Paul's vocals are awesome on this track and the chorus is something special too. Last but never least, the closer, \\"Strike of the Beast\\" ends the album off on an incredible note. This number has great gang vocals at the chorus and some more evil vocals from Paul.<br /><br />So Bonded By Blood, while not THEE most influential thrash record, can not be taken lightly nor can it be disregarded. Yes Triple B might not be as good as more \\"classic\\" thrash albums (Master of Puppets, Peace Sells, Reign in Blood) but ask almost any diehard thrash fan, and they'll tell you, Bonded By Blood is a must have and essential for any metalheads collection.fan, and they'll tell you, Bonded By Blood is a must have and essential for any metalheads collection.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I watched the entire season (had it on my DVR) over a 2-day period. I'm not your history buff but did have some questions about the timelines.  Be that as it may, I was struck by the incredible acting - JRM commanded the room but unlike Richard Burton in Anne of a Thousand Days, he didn't take it over - his acting allowed for a powerful and increasingly more commanding Henry VIII and other personalities in his court to have their presence as well.  Unbelievable costumes....I can't even begin to imagine how all this clothing was made for one production. The jewelry and the jewels on the clothes...unbelievable.  The cast was so spot on right for their parts.  In the beginning, I thought Sam Neill was too \\"modern\\" to have played the part of the Cardinal but he grew on me until I forgot his other \\"modern\\" movie parts.  I, too, was a Rome addict and didn't think I'd get into another series so soon after Rome's ending....but now I absolutely cannot wait until this season comes out on DVD and have to wait until '08 for season 2 - I don't want to give anything away, but at the rate the production is going, they could spend 3 seasons just on the Anne B. storyline...I look forward to see where they go with this series.

B0000047CW|5.0|Bossa nova music was created largely by Antonio Carlos Jobim and João Gilberto in the late 1950s and early 1960s. When Charlie Byrd and his trio heard it, they wanted to make a bossa nova album of their own. The result is this wonderful CD.<br /><br />The CD track set opens with an extended version of \\"Desafinado.\\" The guitar gets plenty of air time in bossa nova music; and Charlie Byrd's guitar solo stuns me with its beauty and sensitivity. \\"Desafinado\\" plays with a few key changes to enhance the quality of the number; and the percussion works very well, too.<br /><br />\\"Samba Dees Days\\" picks up the tempo considerably; and this ought to brighten any party you play this at! Stan Getz plays tenor sax to perfection; and Buddy Deppenschmidt along with Bill Reichenbach play the drums very, very well. \\"Samba Triste\\" is the only truly mournful sounding samba on this album; the minor keys work very well as Stan's melancholy solo enhances the forlorn flavor to \\"Samba Triste.\\"<br /><br />\\"Samba De Uma Nota S&oacute; (One Note Samba)\\" exudes elegance and style; when you listen to this track the fusion of jazz and samba is very evident. \\"E Luxo S&oacute;\\" reverts to a faster tempo that really makes you want to get up and dance wherever you are; and \\"Bahia (Ba&iacute;a)\\" concludes the album with a silky elegance that is singularly beautiful.<br /><br />There is one extra number. The bonus track is the 45 rpm issue of \\"Desafinado.\\" Naturally, the shorter version of this number doesn't provide us with the luxurious meanderings of the full length track. Nevertheless, it interests the listener to hear what the band chose to include--and exclude--when, under time constraints, they had to deliver the number fast yet with all the brightness of the full rendition. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The liner notes include the original liner notes by Dom Cerulli; and there are great black and white photos of the band members playing. John Litweiler contributes an informative essay about the creation of the album as well. The quality of the sound is excellent.<br /><br />I highly recommend this CD for any fan of bossa nova music; and people who enjoy jazz with a samba twist will cherish this one for ages to come.e sound is excellent.

B000ECX0QU|3.0|\\"Topaz\\" is a tired Cold War thriller from the Master.<br /><br />After the disaster of \\"Torn Curtain\\", Hitchcock had a go at making another \\"Bond-like\\" film but once again he missed the mark and never tried it again. If he had not made the brilliant \\"Frenzy\\" three years later one could easily have come to the conclusion that he was well past his best.<br /><br />One of the major problems with \\"Topaz\\" is that the actors are all second-rate - particulary Frederick Stafford in the lead role of a French intelligence agent.<br /><br />There are some interesting touches  - for example the scene in the flower shop where we can't hear what the actors are saying - but this film smacks of a once-great director struggling to find his feet in the \\"modern\\" cinema.<br /><br />\\"Topaz\\" should be seen once by all Hitchcock fans, but despite the advocacy of Leonard Maltin and other reviewers, Hitchcock's third-to-last film doesn't have much to recommend it.
0393312836|5.0|A Clockwork Orange (\\"orange\\" referring to a seemingly normal outward appearance, \\"clockwork\\" referring to the idea that, on the inside, human beings are controlled by either God, the Devil, or the Almighty State) is a classic work of fiction known mainly for its rich use of \\"Nadsat,\\" a language created by Burgess and used throughout the entire novel, and its controversial elements of rape and violence.<br /><br />The book takes place around, and is told by, Alex, who at the beginning of the novel is fifteen and by the end of the novel is around eighteen. The book starts off with a series of events that set the tone for the state of law and order in the novel (Alex and his \\"droogs\\" rob, rape, and pillage with no regard for authority or their elders). In a nutshell, Alex's \\"droogs\\" turn against him, he is imprisoned, he is promised to be released if he undergoes Ludovico's Treatment, he is brainwashed against violence, returns to violence, and at the end finally decides to repudiate violence of his own accord (if the version you're reading contains the twenty-first chapter, that is).<br /><br />The book focuses mainly on a loss of morals, facilitated by the State, but carried out on an everyday basis by the people, or, more specifically, by the youth. Burgess satirizes such things as police brutality by portraying the State's hiring of gang members to positions in the police department, subtly comparing the police of future generations to be no better than the criminals. Burgess also satirizes the future status of religion by presenting Alex's point of view on the bible (when reading about the crucifixion, he imagines himself nailing Jesus onto the cross), which represents the idea that religion will become increasingly irrelevant as a direct result of degeneration among the youth. Other themes in the novel include: good and evil, the transition from adolescence to adulthood, government meddling, corrupt political practices, and free will.<br /><br />Overall, the book excellently demonstrates Burgess's intellectual grasp on society and also his commanding use of language. It's worth the read.tes Burgess's intellectual grasp on society and also his commanding use of language. It's worth the read.

B00007LTIL|4.0|This isn't in the same league as the previous Workingman's Dead. But like that album, American Beauty is a must, even if you're not a Deadhead, and I'm not one. The bad news is that they stretch a couple of these songs to the breaking point (Attics of My Life; Candyman), something they wisely avoided on Workingman's, and while I can't say I hate Till the Morning Comes, it doesn't really impact me all that much.<br />Now for the rest of the album, which is excellent. The back-porch folk Friend of the Devil is my favorite Dead song ever. The philisophical Ripple, pleasant opener Box of Rain, fine country-rocker Operator, groupie ode Sugar Magnolia, the oddly eerie Brokedown Palace, and the self-mythologizing rocker Truckin' (you know, the one with the famous double entendre \\"What a long, strange trip it's been!\\") make up the rest of my favorites. You'll note that's the rest of the album, which basically means \\"this is a very good album!\\" Because it is. Far better than the \\"classic\\" Live/Dead. This and its predecessor are two essential albums.
