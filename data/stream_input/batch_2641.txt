B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The acting was excelent and it gave you a great insight as to the life of the aristocracy in the early 20th century.  Kept my interest thru all seasons.
B000053W52|1.0|Would not play on my DVD player! Nothing in the ad suggested any type of language requirement or other options to purchase correct movie.
2930718323|5.0|At first Dorian does not realize his wishes been granted. He falls in love with a beautiful young actress who is every woman that Shakespeare ever wrote about. But once again due to Lord Henry's influence, he realizes that she's just a common girl.<br /><br />Starting with absent-minded acts Dorian slowly sinks into debauchery. And with every new act his picture becomes more grotesque while Dorian stays is young and as innocent looking as the day his picture was painted.<br />What will become of Dorian?<br />What will become of Dorian's painting?<br />What would you do if you were Dorian?<br /><br />Oscar Wilde paints a picture himself as he describes Dorian Gray's dilemma. And we as readers travel with Dorian as each decision is made. In some places in the story Oscar Wilde seems to drag on and on with detail; however we find that this detail is necessary to set the next scene.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde himself led a risky life that lead to a jail sentence; is attitudes can be seen in the dialogues in this book.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well it's really fun, it has the temple run sort of thing but you only go strait and switch lanes, it is very fun, with hover boards,awesome characters that you can customize and collect special tokens for sweet surprises. You can get higher multipliers bye doing missions and when you reach 30 multiplier, you can do special missions for super mystery box's, oh yeah, there are power ups, coin magnet, double multiplier, jet pack, and super sneakers. Every time you \\"die\\" you can save yourself with keys, and keep going.<br /><br />There are rare glitches but other than that it is an awesome game.
B0083SBMBM|3.0|Obviously I am in the minority, but I didn't get it. I am not a comic book or comic movie fan, but I loved the Iron Man movies. Captain America was also good. This was something else. Maybe you have to follow comic movies to get it. I thought it was a horribly confusing story. I couldn't tell who Scarlett Johansson was supposed to be or what her talent was. The archer guy was another mystery. The \\"heroes\\" often didn't act like heroes. The 3D was cool, but not enough to keep me awake. Downey was awesome, as usual. Samuel L. Jackson was himself... again. Overall it was just kind of boring.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a very great app and is highly addictive but after a while it gets boring.but dont get me wrong its still a great app
B004KAWC0C|3.0|Got the urge to re-watch this recently, and it was just as entertaining as I'd remembered. But what's the deal with the sound? There's a bizarre echo-y distortion that's particularly evident in sections where the orchestration is string-heavy. For  instance, the last section of \\"I Would Be Surprisingly Good For You\\" is almost ruined by it.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|No question about the world created, the interaction of the characters, the crispness of the dialogue but some of the plot twists seem quite random.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|It's a shame that such quality performances are rendered virtually unlistenable by the disgustingly brickwalled mastering.  If I would have done my research, I'd have held off buying the CD and found some lossless rip from the vintl master.  Never again. Five stars for the music, but only one for the brickwalled mastering makes it three stars in the end.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is a fun game to help pass the time. The game is very colorful and creative. Find out for yourself. You wont regret it.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love this stylus. The three tips help in everyday work with my tablet. The finest tip (inside) worked best with the art apps. The only thing I wish is that I could find one of these with just one more tip that would be a real pen or pencil.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This is a wonderful movie that was crafted very well. It reminds me of the blood feud of the ancient greek family house of Atreus. There appears no way out and the situation is hopeless. In the end, a person is sacrificed to removed the blood guilt. In this case, ironically, it is a Korean war Vet saving the life of an American Born Korean. This movie had so many unexpected surprises. I truly enjoyed it. It should have gotten an academy award. I think this movie truly grasps the situations facing America today.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. I had heard so much chatter that I wanted to check it out, but I have to admit to being disappointed. I wish this author the best and cannot deny her extraordinary success, but this is not a book I would recommend to friends. I am told that I might be hooked if I went farther into it, but I just couldn't hang with it.
B00BZODDYU|3.0|Scary. Not very at all. I was disappointed. The movie was ok but no creep factor. The plot was great but I expected so much more.
B000YJ6736|4.0|This book is very well written, McEwan is a wonderful author.  His characters are intriguing people, and McEwan explores their personalities fully.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. It was cute and funny. Some of the humor is more for adults and not so much kids.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is amazing. I love the fact that you can get inspriation, progect ideas, recipes, news articles and loved products. Highly recommended for any one seeking ideas.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I enjoyed this movie. The witches were creepy and action packed. You will not be disappointed if you order it.
B001IF277K|5.0|This is a brand new battery to replace my old battery which could not withstand power for a long time. This is working well and now I need not to bother much of battery loss as compared to my previous one. Overall nice purchase.
B003QTUQGU|5.0|This was a great movie. This is typical Tim Burton and it's fantastic. He didn't stray far from the original Alice in Wonderland but like always put his own twist on it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|this game is fun but now I am stuck on level 6.. anyone know how to find the blue weight?
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I never know what to expect from a Jodi Picoult book. She is so creative with her story lines and characters.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a delightful story that leaves you with a grin and a sigh. A quick read great for a trip or beach reading
B00CEQ1JOO|4.0|I bought Twyla for my little sister's birthday, but then I realized this was the doll she did NOT want. So, I'm keeping her instead. (: She's cute, but not my favourite. When I unboxed her she had very bad hair. There was too much gel and so much hair was falling out, but I gave her a quick wash and now she's fine. (: What I like most is that she's smaller (Howleen-sized).<br />There's also this small bump on her nose (like the CAM vampire boy but smaller) and I think it's adorable! I keep falling in love with Monster High's different face molds!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just love Bingo and this one is so exciting. and I can used my coins for SLOTS and play a bunch of games,
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Follett knows how to grab the reader in the first few pages...and keep you hooked. The setting is England and France during the final days of WWII in Europe; the focus is on the Brits role in supporting/tapping the French Resistance, and one particularly daring (and beautiful) senior British officer and her Nazi nemesis. Not super complex as Follett novels go...but an excellent summer read.
B008NA2JMQ|5.0|It is books like these that make me read almost exclusively non-fiction. You cannot make up stories like these. True events make for the best stories. The wolf of wall street's story is certainly no exception.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i like the game its pretty entertaining takes your mind off things aswell lets you play with horses who doesn't like that
0547978847|1.0|I was looking to download this Kindle edition to my tablet, and am I glad I decided to read the reviews for this newer Richard Howard translation first. Fortunately, I have a hard cover Katherine Wood translation for comparison. Well, I didn't make it past the first page of the sample, and would've been sorely disappointed had I actually paid for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really liked this book and was absorbed in getting to know the characters. While it was a sad book at times, it was not depressing.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|I really like Boz's new CD put into my playlist went we go sailing. Have got quite a few comments who is this I love this song.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love the game. Needs better instructions on how to play and get started. Otherwise its a pretty cool game. My daughter and I love it
B008J34466|5.0|P!nk has done it again - a kick ass album - if you like P!nk this album is a MUST HAVE - buy it and then go see her in concert - she is the coolest on a stage
0784011710|5.0|My mother had not seen this movie and had heard a lot about it.  Both my parents enjoyed it very much.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Alicia Keys has a voice like no one else and the songs on this album are a must have. Buy it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Cant stop playing! Really fun puzzle game! Keeps me guessing as I poke around the different rooms....Ive been stumped on quite a few levels!
B000T45C6E|4.0|If you work hard you can get what you want if the timing is right - great portrait of a true story and awesome acting
0142419303|5.0|My grandson loves to read and love's reading Roald Dahl's work. I've been told it was a very good read by my Grandson whom I had purchased it for.
B007HJ9LXE|4.0|Selma Hayek is portraying Frida Kahlo so good. I find this painter one of the most interesting characters in art over time
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|Awesome movie! Hansel is hot! Great special effects.I would watch it again. I don't know what else to say. thank you
B002GHHHL0|4.0|Everytime I think of this film I remember Dave Chappelle's imitation of Sam Jackson. The movie was good, I don't get why LL Cool J is one of the survivors, this would be like the 3rd film I watch in that he could have died but he doesn't. Saffran Burrows was good in the film, well done but not spectacular.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love love love this series. I just can't wait for the next one !! It is one of the best series I have read.
B003Y5H5FG|1.0|I hate when Hollywood makes remakes and reboots, they always try to add some actor/actress under the age limit that harms the reputation of a classic film, hence my point with this film.<br /><br />The film is not scary, no scene in the movie has a bit of it. No suspense, chiller friendly. The acting was hesitant and seemed to be pushed to do and say something.<br /><br />The classic had everything, this film had Colin Farrell, that's enough for me to say...
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Great script...great acting. Downey just doesn't know how to deliver less than his best. He is not only a magnificent actor....he is fun to watch acting. Downey has that innate ability to make any script work well. Can't teach that.
B00A9T1HUO|3.0|I bought this on a leap of faith as a loyal fan, even though I really didn't care for his last album, and to be honest (before I mount my soap box), it WAS more than I expected. I really liked some of the selections, such as \\"Un Alma Mas,\\" and \\"The Moon's a Harsh Mistress,\\" as well as the bonus tracks on the Target special addition that I purchased--especially \\"Satellite\\" and \\"Play Me.\\" Howeverrrrr.... I feel like Josh Groban has really fallen into a \\"blah\\" rut where all of his songs/albums sound the same and have the same flow. I won't even get started on how 7/11 \\"When I Fall in Love, etc.\\" is...... \\"I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever....\\" and ever... and ever.... and ever... we get it. Every time I hear he is releasing a new album, I hope he'll actually come up with something new, but it seems like every album is one of those situations where I buy the whole album, but really only listen to 3-4 songs ...consistently (assuming the skip button is within reach....). Maybe I'm just too picky, but as a former music major, I want to be surprised by and engaged in the music I listen to, and this new style of his just doesn't cut it for me. I give this 3 stars because I love his voice. I just wish he could recapture the \\"awesomeness\\" of his Closer album. <-- personal opinion.
B000Q7ZND6|5.0|Keanu shines in this movie, like he did in the Matrix Trilogy, as one of the most believable actors in Hollywood. Keanu was born for his role in Constantine....and the Matrix. The script and actor were perfectly matched.
0060235152|5.0|Each animal depicted can do a simple movement like this gorilla for instance on the cover, he can thump his chest and he asks can you do it? And the child on the next page says &#34;I can do it&#34;. This book allows children to mimic simple actions that get them used to following almost like a simon says pattern and has a format that repeats multiple times like all of Eric Carle's wonderful childrens' books that it creates a beginning reader just from the mere simplicity of repetivness, beautiful illustrations with actions that small ones can follow and interact upon and they begin to memorize the text so that when they are sitting with you following the words they already know, they begin to recognize how to actually READ those words and build their beginning reader vocabulary. We have been collecting Mr, Carle's books now for about a month and this one is a big hit with our little one who can now read the whole story TO US.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is well worth its cost.  Quick and reactive. Many different ways to play.  I love this game.  Thanks so much.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I read all three books in a row, so I am not sure how I would have felt about the ending if I had had to wait for the third installment to come out. I am a middle school teacher, so I try to read what the students are reading to keep up with their likes and dislikes. I suggested to the librarian that we bring this one in for the girls who had cut their teeth on the Twilight series.
B00D6BQPMM|2.0|While the story line was ok at best, i struggled to make it through the movie as the special fx are not the best. I would recommend waiting for this to hit Netflix or similar before watching. A waste of money in my eyes.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun to play; highly recommend it; I can not wait for more floors; one of my favorite free games of all time
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I didn't much care for the sorry line. In fact, for the first time ever mark Wahlberg nearly put me to sleep.
0061808121|3.0|Met Expectations in all areas. This items performed as advertised and was a good fit for my particular improvement needs
B00785P2QC|4.0|ok game much like cityville was on facebook. I dislike that in order to get rid of some goals I have tolike them on fb and subscribe to emails and write reviews. I will do all of those things if I want not be forced into doing it
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I was tired of playing the &#34;find the pack&#34; game all the time. Since we bought this we haven't lost it yet, even though we do have a backup just in case. Not to mention that it's adorable!
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Loved the entire series, especially Richard Armitage as John Thorton.<br />The music is beautiful & I wish BBC would release a soundtrack to this series.
030758836X|4.0|Great book, with such an unexpected ending. It kept me up at night bc I couldn't stand to put it down!
B00BHHB4WI|5.0|A must see for baby boomers! And please remember, when you recommend it to a friend, don't spoil the ending!
B00CF34B2I|4.0|.I love MTG and play it  on my  Xbox pc and now my kindle. As a collector of the cards as with well the art work is true to the real thing. If you love playing its a must have. You can play anywhere now!!!
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I read the book & this movie follows it right to the end...which will have you laughing & crying  at the same time!!!
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|Had I actually been able to view this I might have liked it but Amazon Prime does nort have suffient bandwidth to make this work!
B009LMTDL0|4.0|This book was filled with useful tips for getting ahead in a male dominated workplace. Really motivating to get out there and making a difference in the workforce.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|Just as good the second time.  Great actor Jim carry I love him. Topic is different than usual movies great
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Longmire is better in print than on TV. I love the flawed characters and the way the author describes the small town lifestyle.
B00AZRP2GA|5.0|Then getting old would appeal :-) This book was superb and exquisitely believable. As the previous reviews mention, every chapter brings forth a new and plausible concept - all wrapped up in humanities greatest fear - old age.
B000NOKA0S|4.0|i like anything Leonard Cohen writes or sings, although some are better than others.Loved Suzanne, Maryanne and some the others too.
B002W7H3EA|4.0|Espionage / Intrigue long before movies like Bourne. They just don't make them like this any more. You won't be disappointed
B004G600A4|5.0|It's a Disney flick, need I say more? I bought it off Amazon because I don't believe in paying stupid prices, I got this at a great deal and way under what the public was paying for it in the stores, even with the shipping price included. I buy most of my movies online because of this. Besides, I love getting packages in the mail.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I had a hard time keeping up with the characters. I would get bored and read another book, then pick it up and try to get into again. May be why I couldn't keep up! It just didn't hold my interest like his other books.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I kinda dig it ... no, it is nowhere near the Glory Days of Peace Sells, So Far, and Rust in Peace ... but it isn't half bad!  Mid-paced stuff ... but he has been going this direction for years!  So why is that a surprise to anyone?  Other than the title track, it is still unlikely to be played on Top 40 ... and even that one is a stretch.  So no, it's not bad ... fits a level above Risk and 13 ... a tad below everything else.  In summation, I was not upset I bought it at all.
1442359315|1.0|Dr. Alexander succeeds in making Heaven a boring read in this dull, drab book. I personally can't understand why God or actually that's &#34;OM&#34; to Dr. Alexander (he has renamed the Saviour - if that's not a narcissist what is?) would choose a man who's writing is so lifeless and uninspiring.  Even the note he writes to his birth parents is cold and impersonal. I personally wouldn't want to meet him.  This book left a bad taste in my mouth and I have to go with my gut. Unless God is trying to reach skeptical scientists through this awful book, I would be inclined to agree this is a money grab, from a guy who saw opportunity in his coma. There are better  'life after death' books than this one. Don't waste your money. If you must, check it out from the library.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is the bomb!  Great way to keep your mind sharp!  Will I introduce it to my 8 year old for problem solving practice.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Not that great.  Glad Sam's back in the picture.  But it seems like the story line is petering out.  Oh we'll.  There's always the HBO series.
B000AAF1U4|5.0|I wanted something for the family and old favorites are always a plus.  And there is no other site to find exactly what I want other than on Amazon.  Still the best.
B005IQZB14|5.0|I would love to have the balls to do this!! This was a very well told account of a life event.  I felt like I was right there with her (but glad I was safely tucked into my temperature controlled, bear free, running water equipped home).

B00DC7NNAC|1.0|Disney you are better than this.  The script was horribly corny and almost seemed like an afterthought to the cheesy overuse of CG.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I had been looking forward to this book but had a hard time getting into it. It seemed to drag on with filler of how they felt and were so perfect for each other. I also noticed more imitations of 50 shades in this book. When the author gets back to the formula used in the other books its is great. I eventually got more into it. I enjoyed seeing where the story of Gideon and Eva went. One thing I didn't like - they shouldn't promote using lotion in place of lube. But I did really like that scene and the story behind it. IMO - worth reading if you've been following the series.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The story goes on, yay, I'm so glad we get to read more about them and everyone else, books need to be here sooner
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Couldn't put it down, I didn't want it to end.  That's always a good sign.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|bought for my mom. she has Alzheimer's and is really enjoying watching the old classic movies! rgj retr rett rteer
B00AESN8XY|3.0|The Plague had my interest for maybe two rounds and then I said, “Why?”  I should have been turned off by the concept of the game but then again it’s just a game.  It was not complicated enough and I am not sure what I would do to improve the game but it needed something.
159562015X|5.0|got these for my team at work. we are still reading but very interesting to find out what our strengths are!

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Simply magnificent album after ten years or so 'absence'.<br />Another great example how some artists just keep improving over time on various creative levels.<br />Every time you hear it you'll hear something you didn't quite notice previously.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great book. I picked picked up Vol 1 for free and had to buy the rest. There are some really great original ideas in here. Great sci-fi dystopian future stuff. Interesting characters and a storyline that sucks you in. Bravo, Mr Howey, Bravo.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|Amazing show!! Recommend to all!! I can't blink from the beginning to the and!! Very different from regular vamps series!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book will also certainly change the way you think about your life. If nothing else, if gives tools for dealing with anxiety, fear...many of our problems that are caused by over-thinking. I personally still have many questions after reading it- an extraordinarily interesting read over all!
B005EVVESM|4.0|This is good music, very easy listening. I appreciate the fact that Amazon is really good about getting things to you pretty timely too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Season 2 was just as good as season 1.  The new characters added to the story were an added bonus and not just an extra addition to the story.  Very well done and can't wait until season three!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Nice re-boot to the series. The aliens are fun to watch and, and the plots are interesting. Captain Jack is fun to watch too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I've been playing this for an hour and I can't stop playing it!Totally worth it, runs great and is almost like having a horse! I would recommend this to anyone
B00821OX98|5.0|I was looking for some good sci-fi to watch when this shows up on Amazon Prime.  The show is well done and well acted, and it makes you think, but whatever are the New England accents I know and love?? These people are from the Boston area, and not one character has an accent!
B001EBWIV8|5.0|Every time I watch these movies I get more out of them.  Definitely worth the money.  The performances are great though there are a few instances where I'm annoyed because I am not buying something someone says or does.  However, this does not overshadow the overall quality and enjoyment of the films.
0385737955|4.0|I read the description for The Maze Runner like a couple of years ago and decided that I wanted to add it to my TBR list. But it's been since I initially added it that I've read the description, and I don't think I've read a single review for this book either. That being said, I pretty much went into The Maze Runner blind--which is a good thing to me.<br /><br />The Maze Runner was definitely different from most of the books I like to read. I like books that are about lurve! But that's not really what The Maze Runner is about. You do find out that Thomas has a connection to Teresa (the girl who shows up the day after him) where perhaps before they had their memories wiped they might have been developing a \\"thing,\\" but no memories means we don't know for sure.<br /><br />Anyway, Thomas was a likable character for me, but I didn't get too attached to many of the other Gladers. For some reason the majority of the guys living in the Glade were kind of secretive about what's going on. They pretty much kept Thomas in the dark about everything, but they'd get annoyed when he pressed for answers or when he didn't really know what was going on. Of course, Thomas couldn't leave himself in the dark and so he did what any sane person would do who has woke up in the middle of a maze with no memory of their previous life, he kept pressing until he got answers. All the secrecy between the guys in the Glade keeps  the reader in the dark just as much as Thomas and so from a reading stand point I was hooked early on to find out just what in the world is going on. However, that same aspect also got old quick.<br /><br />I loved how James Dashner created this world of the Glade and the Maze. I loved how the kids had their own language and terminology that has been developed over time. But I never could really picture the Grievers like Mr. Dashner described them. I came up with one picture in my head after Thomas's first glimpse of a Griever through the window, but then Thomas's first encounter with one in the actual Maze gave me a completely different picture. --I'm completely aware that if you haven't read this book, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but I'm trying not to spoil anything.<br /><br />All in all, I'm very intrigued to see what the next test and environment is going to be thrown at these poor kids in The Scorch Trials, book 2. The Maze Runner gets 4 Stars from me. What do you think? Have you read The Maze Runner? Let me know!<br /><br />For more reviews check out Somewhere Only We Know - [...]actual Maze gave me a completely different picture. --I'm completely aware that if you haven't read this book, you have no idea what I'm talking about, but I'm trying not to spoil anything.

B00BI73CVI|1.0|Les Miserables was my favorite book as a child so I was anxious to see this.  It might have been good had it not been a musical but  we hated that it was ALL done as singing.  This isn't like Sound of Music where there is a story being acted out and then interspersed with some songs at certain points.  The entire dialog was in song and we hated that and turned it off after 15 min.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|These books are great. It's been a while since I've been this engaged with a novel. Chapter after chapter, it never disappoints. Buying all 4 together makes sense. You can also use the search function to go back and review content forgotten, an important tool for books of this size.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|Special effects great.  Story line flowed.  I don't know why this movie did so poorly at the theaters.  I can't wait for the grandkids to see it.

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is very good and you can search for just about anything you are looking for.. it's a very good amp to have and we use it quite alot
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Loving this game takes long to load but still loving it. Keep doing what your doing. You guys did a wonderful job
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I've read them all and I'm starting to buy them for my Kindle, but I have them all in paper/hard back already. I'm super excited to see the movie and I hope they make all of them into movies. Can't wait for the final book to be released. I hate to see the series end.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|good need to fix a few things though like my cart and chat dont work very well but still worth geting if ur a pc gamer
1452110581|5.0|As a cat lover, I enjoy anything cat. I took this book to school and shared with my students. Middle schoolers loved it!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun playing this game with my boys ages 9 &amp; 15.  Wish it had more levels.  We found it challenging.
1449410243|5.0|As a multiple cat owner, I needed to know if my cats really coul do this. I know this was tongue in cheek and hilarious!
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|The only thing i can think of that would make it better is more weaps keep developing it you guys
B006C3Q6GG|3.0|Enjoyed the story but it is laborious reading. Fortunately the Kindle provides the integrated dictionary and internet search features that became essential to understanding the colloquial phrases, vocabulary, and ship terms.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I have shown it to my family members and they have also enjoyed the movie.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|It took me about a week to warm up to RAM - I must admit I didn't get it at first.  But once I listened to it 4 or 5 times, I found myself liking the tracks I had written-off in my first go round.<br />I really seems like they wanted to do something very different from their other work, and it absolutely is.  It's still spacey and futuristic, with the funky beats we've all come to know and love - but it's also seems to be harkening back to their past - to their roots - and even into their own hearts, souls, and memories.<br /><br />It feels like a very personal album and that, above all else, is what I love about it.
B005S9EKCW|3.0|Another movie version of a musical, like Phantom of the Opera, terribly miscast from a singing perspective.  Only the rebels at the barricade could sing.  Hugh Jackman's voice has range, but it is unpolished, and he screamed his high notes, Amanda Seyfried's voice also had range but was as thin as a rail, and Anne Hathaway's presentation of I Dreamed a Dream was dramatic rather than sung as it should be.  (It is the musical's signature tune.)  Forget Russell Crowe, who would have made a great Javert in a dramatic role but who should forgo future musical performances.  I immediately turned on the 25th Anniversary performance to hear the musical sung well (despite the gain-ridden sonics that ruin the recording, at least as presented on PBS.)  It's a MUSICAL guys.  Choose musicians for the roles.
B002TWWOHE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite shows. The chemistry between the characters is fantastic, the dialogue is witty, and the plot is original. I definitely think you should try it out if you're looking for something interesting to see.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great relaxing brain training.  Now my nieces and nephews love it, too!  Perfect for De-stressing after a rough day.<br /><br />Highly recommend.
B001OSIV62|4.0|Great documentary. I especially enjoyed watching him grow up with his true loves: his woman and his tightrope walking. I admire the universal message of happiness in his displays. My only criticism is that it took quite a while to even see him tightrope walk. Beggars cannot be choosers I suppose.
B0059A149C|5.0|Good aerial sequences (with some actual combat footage), restrained acting, believable situations in the airplane all go to make this film gripping and enjoyable. If you like war stories set in airplanes this is the one for you.
B008602KQI|5.0|Modern day Lord of the Flies. This is as lighthearted or powerful as you want to make it. Therein lies it's appeal.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show never interested me (sounded too hokey) until a trusted friend said to give it a try, and now I trust that friend even more. Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki  lead an ensemble of talented actors having fun doing something totally ridiculous yet making it seem plausible -- which is exactly why it works.<br /><br />Eye candy aside, the lead actors (Ackles in particular) display an impressive range of physical and verbal talent.<br /><br />The names they go by in each episode and the music are a delight and clever writing tool.<br /><br />I am a huge \\"Doctor Who\\" fan (since it was reborn this century!) because of the writing, and this certainly compares in refreshing, interesting, cunning twists and turns. The dialogue is delightful.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|I work in an industry that directly supports drilling and all of these nasty chemicals, and let me tell you, this is nasty stuff! 1/2 cup of ethylene glycol will kill a man, and it's virtually tasteless, odorless, and slightly sweet. I would caution you against assuming who the 'enemy' is in this film. I speak with 'customers' every day and I can tell you that they are you and I. They live on the same street as you, every other house all the way down the road. This is the rat race we live.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This Fifty Shades-esque story is defiantly worth reading.  I love that both of the main characters have their own issues to work out and by imposing them on each other each character grows.  Eva and Gideon love each other in such a way that they make you want to believe that it can happen to everyone - that there really is someone out there for everyone.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This one is a classic.  We like having the Blu-ray / DVD combo to be able to use the Blu-ray at home and take the DVD with us on trips.
B000784WMW|5.0|Very happy with my purchase this has always been one of my favorite movies. Will watch it many, many times.
B0030IIZ56|5.0|This one is a classic.  We like having the blu-ray / DVD combo to be able to use the blu-ray at home and take the DVD with us on trips.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is an awesome replacement for a real stable!!!!!! I love this game! so cool and I totally recommend it to everybody that loves horses!!!
B003ASLJK4|4.0|Thank you.  This is my favorite and I will do business with you again.  Hope you have a nice summer
B003P2WO5E|4.0|Imagine the life of a typical soldier running towards the battle line, Armour shining, shield raised to protect you against the rain of arrows, sword ready to defend or kill as necessary. Probably a 50/50 chance of survival. Now imagine the life of a Bridgeman, forced to be the first to run at the enemy, weaponless, without armour and carrying a 2 tonne ladder on your back. You are going to need the gods on your side to survive this one! Kalidin unknowingly is under such protection, gifted with the ability to consume Stormlight which enhances his combat abilities 10 fold and allows him to control gravity itself. Medieval Marvel anyone, a great first book, can't wait for number 2.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Thank you.  This is my favorite and I will do business with you again.  Hope you have a nice summer
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I purchased this as a gift.  After playing it he said it was lovely to just sit back and relax while listening to her sing.
B00003CXRP|5.0|Thank you.  This is my favorite and I will do business with you again.  Hope you have a nice summer
B0000CAXID|5.0|I didnt really become a big fan until about 10 years ago.  I never owned this cd, and I always buy cds because my favorite car isnt young enough to have an mp3 hook up, but it does have a cd player, and that's to compliment the cassette player.  Chicks cannot live by cassette alone!  Not anymore.  This was the last item standing in the way of my completion of the Foo's Ultimate-Carey's Kollection.  (Thats my own name for it, and I'm about to copyright it so dont get any ideas, k?) I cant say I have one favorite cd but this is in the top 3.  Despite announcing an indefinite hiatus, Super Dave is currently writing material for their 8th studio album.<br /><br />I cannot wait.  Well, technically, I can, but I'm kind of excited so I just say I cant wait.  I'll find something else to do besides just sitting here.  No worries.
B00013RC66|4.0|Thank you.  This is my favorite and I will do business with you again.  Hope you have a nice summer
B003Y5D776|5.0|I needed a way to record voicemail from my iPhone to my computer. (My father passed away a month prior and I wanted to keep the last messages he had left for me.) My new MacBook Pro does not have an audio in, this allowed me to connect a cable from the headphone jack of the phone into the Griffin, and record via the USB. No setup, just choose the input in the System Preferences. Done and done.<br /><br />Worked perfectly, even if I never need to use it again, it was more than worth it.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Thank you.  This is my favorite and I will do business with you again.  Hope you have a nice summer
B00CWY76CC|1.0|The title for this game should be called &quot;Can You PLAY??&quot;  The instructions for this game are nonexistent. Nothing to tell or show you how to begin to get started to play. I couldn't get anything to happen on the first screen.  Eventually found the horse puzzle but that was it.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Thank you.  This is my favorite and I will do business with you again.  Hope you have a nice summer
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I was expecting more from this book. I was hoping for more character development but instead left many things open and didn't reach a climax of any sort. The book was filled sex filler scenes that contributed nothing more than the previous two books. The ending was abrupt and out of the blue.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It solved my problem with my Kindle, it was handled quickly and at no cost.  Thank you so much. Arthur S. Moore
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I find it disappointing that kindle markets its products beyond the United States but denies apps to those residing outside of the US.  Considering that the world is one global village, alienating other markets send only one message...that is, the relevant companies are incapable of handling the growth of its product.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|An excellent performance by Matthew McGounhay, I didn't have any idea what the story was, but this movie easily held my intetest
B00BT1XCOU|1.0|The show should have only ran 6 seasons. After the sixth season the shows writing and acting seemed forced. The jokes were old, and the show is just terrible. The seventh season was slow, but season 8 was terrible. I am going to stop watching after this season.
B00866H7SS|4.0|What great characters.  These ones are more believable and the story is captivating. What a great easy read - to fall in love again again. Well done. Can't wait to start the second book
B005LAIH9A|5.0|When I first went to the movie theater to see this movie, I was afraid that it would be terrible. The reason why I thought it would be bad was that in the first three American Pies, they are all young and those movies were about the time in your life when sex was a major part of your life. When you get older and have kids, (like they did), your not that raunchy. I was SO glad I was wrong. It was hilarious! The characters have kind of changed, but not too much. The basic premise of this is the gang heads back to their hometown for their 13th year anniversary. I don't want to spoil anything for you, but it is a very funny movie, and I would highly recommend it. If you haven't seen any other of the American Pie movies (not the s****y spin-offs) you may be confused on some of the jokes. So if I were you I would watch them first.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|FUN game but wish there were more than the ten levels. Some areas were not responding well to touch either
1781162646|5.0|I have always wanted to read one of Stephen Kings books, I had enjoyed the movies his books were based on. So I decided to started reading one. I never thought a book would be scary, but this is scary. It is probually one of my favorite books.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book did not dissapoint! I love Eva and of course Gideon......what can you say except amazing. I was surprised at how the book ended and can't wait to continue Eva and Gideon's story.......
B008LCR9W6|3.0|Many good shows have had crappy starts, like The Office, Parks and Recreation, The Big Bang Theory, and even Friends. You just have to get through the first couple episodes then it becomes REALLY funny.
B007SO31BQ|5.0|A very intimate potraite with detailed sound and video of the behind scene pit action, issues, problems, worries, strategies and above, the dedication to his craft that this man had, abovce all others of his time. The concept of &#34;no fear&#34; is a marketing tool to sell T-shirts. This man, like all mortals, was afraid and rightfully so, based on his instincts and experience but he always pushed foward at every opportunity, not just because he was paid to, but because he had to, in his soul.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I couldn't wait for the episodes to become available on Hulu or other sites so I bought the third season and finished it within a week! Loved the third season!
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|Was excited to watch the movie and extremely disappointed, felt like I wasted money. Would not recommend or watch it again.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I love the show and wanted to be able to see it from the beginning so I purchased the first and second seasons.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I could not wait to read the 3rd book and read it straight away once I had downloaded it from amazon. I am now waiting for the next story of Gideon and Eva
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I caught the show last season and wanted to watch from the very beginning so I purchased the first 2 seasons. So far, I have loved the show.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a wonderful app and I look at it each morning and sometime during the day.  It keeps me up to date when I want to do different things during the day.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|He is cute and funny and can keep everyone laughing even if they don't plan on it.  Very contagious for everyone.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|LOVE this game ! My daughter keeps stealing it from me though !! Great for the elder kids to keep them occupied !!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is surprisingly good. the graphics are great and the objective is simple. can't wait to progress further and see what else comes up.<br /><br />Jordan
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved it a back and froth a foreshadowing of the future travels into the past. It always kept me interested. A surprising ending! Fantastic! A great read! A daring mystery, unexpected twists and turns, always keeps u guessing. I recommend to any mystery solvers out there.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I cant stop watching it, i watched season 1 in week. season 2 in 3 days. easy to download. pay with a click.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I freaking LOVE this game! It makes you really think about how things relate and I had a lot of fun playing it :) I recommend it:)
B004NS7120|5.0|enjoyed the movie.  Have watched it many times.  the action was great-couldn't believe it was based on a true story and got a chance to see how dangerous the train business is.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|Couldn't install latest update on MyTouch 4g with Gingerbread 2.3.4.  Removed from device to do fresh install from cloud, and now won't re-install.  I use this app, but now cannot even install it on my phone.  This app is NOT compatible with my device?
B009CF3P7E|5.0|I am an original fan and was very skeptical about this movie but absolutely loved it.  The actors were great and picked up some mannerisms from the originals but also made it their own.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|Amazing novel, but more so because this is Forsyth's first. The sharp, sly voice is a joy to read and drives the captive reader onward. An entertaining subtext leads to a tense empathy with the assassin over the bumbling hierarchy of the radicals, and, of course, the parallel on the security side, with the smart detective amidst the bureaucracy, pomp and circumstance. So much of the post-war popular literature (that was yet to emerge then) dwelt on East-West tensions; it was refreshing to be immersed, instead, in the French politics of the era and to witness the end of the colonial period. Also bracing was the reliance on paper-deskphone technology, with no miracle saves by computers. That leaves a lot of room for intellectual brilliance, which appears in showy profusion. I had not imagined how much I would enjoy this book as both literature AND entertainment.
B003G4W49C|5.0|At the heart of the war effort was a small group of children, brilliant children to be sure and a state of the art communicator the Ansible. The entire point of the war was to save humanity, to to so they had to destroy the Buggers! It had to be children simply because only a child would have empathy enough to understand the Buggers.  They also had to been young enough to be  manipulated, lied  to  and used.  It was a great day for the IF and a terrible day for Ender Wiggin, they won the war, he destroyed an entire race!<br />This is a well written, thought provoking. A definite recommended read.
B000XSWVEC|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and enjoy it every time I watch it. The music is great and the acting is too.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like to play this game all the time,but on paper (item)it says that you can make books and maps.HOW DO YOU MAKE MAPS!!!!!!!????????
B008IYSMLY|5.0|Oh snap!  Things are gettin' real in this season!  Been waiting six seasons for this finale!  Can't wait for season 7!
B0013UIUBC|2.0|This was a watered down version of the original!<br />The original was a 2001 German film titled Mostly Martha, and revolves around a hard-edged chef whose life is turned upside down when she decides to take in her young niece following a tragic accident that killed her sister.<br />I get so frustrated with American remakes at times. At times they get dumbed down & made into movies that tend to have only a hint of the original movie &/or screenplay. I feel like it's an insult to the art & the movie viewer.<br />I highly recommend the original foreign film: Mostly Martha & advise you pass this predictable flick right by!
B002ZM74Y6|1.0|This movie is about very shallow people living selfish lives killing and being killed and getting away with it or being given a pass by the law for witnessing against each other.
0142800805|5.0|I highly recommend this audiobook!<br />I recommend reading anything by this author & this book in particular! However, the audiobook brings the book to life!<br />This book has been translated several times over & brought to the book shelves in many countries. The audiobook has music in it that was composed by the author. I've tried to explain how the small clips of music between the chapters actually adds to the book rather than making it take on a silly note, but I ultimately end up lending out my copy & they hear what I'm talking about.<br />This is one audiobook that is in CD form that I will be holding onto for a long time!<br />This book is for book lovers & is so intriguing that I can't praise it enough!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I think this is an interesting story and worth the entertainment value.  I'm not a Ben Affleck fan but I think he did pretty well in this movie.
B00005KAQP|5.0|This movie made me laugh!!  I had the vhs copy, but the dvd is so much more convenient!!  zIt reminded me of Catholic grammer  school!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|I really liked this movie, I think.  But it stopped right before the end, I mean just as a denouement moment was about to happen. Yes, 15-20 minutes later it finally came back on but the flow was ruined.  So I can't tell if i was dissatisfied with the end because of the writing or directing or because of the video glitch.
0141442468|5.0|Great book. Cover well done by Penguin classics. Goes great in a set of classics by Penguin, and looks great on your shelves on a bookcase.
B00004R99L|3.0|Received this product with 2 other DVDs in a Gerber Graduates box. It has a musty smell, and there is something on the dvd that appears to be maybe something left from sticky fingers. I played it for 10 minutes to see if it would play. It seems to be O.K. despite the clump of residue.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this game is simple mindless entertainment. I can play for a few minutes or an hour. its a little frustrating trying to get to the next level, but praticing is entertaining
B00003CXCQ|3.0|The box this order was shipped in was a Gerber Graduates box. That wouldn't have bothered me, but, it was twice as big as it needed to be, therefore, since there was also NO padding inside, the 3 dvds flopped around inside the box breaking the little cogs that hold the dvds in place in the Sleeping Beauty case. Since there were two dvds in the Sleeping Beauty box, they mixed with the broken pieces and became scratched. When I ordred them, I was thrilled the Sleeping Beauty and the Snow White movies were new...that's why I paid a bit more for them, but now the Sleeping Beauty dvds are scratched with damaged cogs. To top it off, the box they were shipped in smells EXTREMELY musty making the DVD boxes also stink. I will not be purchasing anymore dvds from THIS seller in the future. Very disappointed. Am also unhappy about paying $11.97 for shipping for 3 dvds coming from the same place in a stinky, unpadded, thin box.
B001N3OJEG|4.0|I recall going to see this movie when I was 13 with my family. It wasn't on the agenda but the movie we were supposed to see was sold out and so the adults wanted to see this. Of course, as a 13 year old I never heard of it and thought I'd be bored to tears. Imagine my surprise when my siblings and I actually liked it! It quickly became one of the movies we sat together to watch whenever it was on television. Great acting! Great directing! Fantastic screenplay! Absolutely a classic.
B00001QEE9|5.0|Came as promised in great condition. Will be enjoying this favorite old much-loved Disney classic with the grand children very soon.
B005FISBTO|5.0|We love to watch this series and buy the DVD's so we can let our friends borrow them to watch. Great show!

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is a fun little game that hooked me for hours.  Test yourself by not buying any of the extras, they aren't needed!  You can even unlock the expansion game types just by beating the standard game types.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a great series with superb acting and unpredictable story lines.  Watch it and you'll love it.  Can't wait for next season!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I enjoy Evernote, but it seems to take too much memory on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Is there a mechanism to only sync more recent notes, or only certain notebooks? To cut down on space used?
1400064287|5.0|I'm a student of Arts Administration and the only thing I have to say about Made to Stick is that it has changed the way I think about my studies and my actions throughout my career. 5 stars and a recommendation to virtually any reader.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is a fun game I want get the new one but I cannot right now
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's fun for the whole family. My kids enjoy escape while traveling. We play together trying to find the next hint first
B00BBW14YC|5.0|unexpectedly entertaining.  it was even worth reading the subtitles!  of course, you could just watch the dubbed version but I always think that there are subtleties lost when it is dubbed.
B00846REIS|5.0|Could not put the book down , literally read it in one day. Interesting characters kept my attention from page to page, will recommend to friends!!
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have a slow internet so I download my videos and watch by playing from my computer to my TV.  It is pretty easy and the picture is good.  Game of thrones is an awesome series.
1781162646|4.0|Good mix of characters. Good progression of the story. I enjoyed it and I'll look for more books like this from him.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|My favorite bingo game so far!  I have tried most, only to return to my favoritest... BINGO BLITZ!!!<br /><br />To bad the bingo chips run out, Ya?<br /><br />I would have rated 4.5 but that wasn't working out.  lol<br />I don't think 5 is appropriate because there is always room for improving.<br /><br />Off for a game of BINGO BLITZ!
B00479SVBU|4.0|I just got back from a 6 hour plus road trip and the unit worked great.  I used with an iPod and iPhone and the quality was high.  I have used a lot of different adapters for my car and this ranks right up there with the best that I have had, especially for the price.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|What can anyone say about a great book except lets make the best movie possible.  Blue ray is the best way to go.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Needs more ways of getting diamonds and coins instead of paying with actual money and waiting for the next day.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|This was a show I missed at the start, but am so glad I picked it up mid season and went back to the beginning to catch up!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was just as good as the first book in the trilogy. As soon as things wind down, some crazy event takes place,only to grasp your attention once again. I can't read to read the final book of the trilogy.
0792839749|5.0|I grew up on this movie and so naturally had to purchase a copy. Still one of my favorites to watch to this day.
0763644765|5.0|Patricelli is some sort of mad wizard. The illustrations are so emotive, interesting, and relatable, this book is a favorite for my son even though it is a potty book. The gold standard.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I am now in anticipation mode of the next series of Downton Abbey. I had this one watched way too quickly!! Hopefully, though, I will see it sooner on PBS this time. I am left with a rift in my heart, though, with the final episode ending. ;-(
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Unlike the the dvd, this 2cd set is filled with non stop live Beach Boys at their best. The recordings are excellent, the band is in top form and you'll never find a bunch of 70 year olds sound anywhere near this good! My only complaints are, there were several songs I would have added if I were the one putting this set together, I was especially hoping for &#34;Kiss Me, Baby&#34; and &#34;Summer's Gone&#34; would have thrilled me, but you can't have everything. The other thing is the booklet,or lack of. No pics of the spectacular band, no info on where the songs were recorded,it could have been a lot better. But I guess we're lucky that it was even released so I'll shut up now and just enjoy...
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game sucks. I can't stand how the hair moves with the comb. This game only occupied me for 20 seconds. What a useless app. I'm sorry for the insults but this is what I think...
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|After reading some of the reviews I was convinced that so many people can't be wrong so I got it and now I am addicted! My son and I absolutely love this game! He loves sharks and has a blast playing this. Get it you won't regret it. And it's free!
B000006T0D|5.0|In my opinion, this is Blondies greatest album ever.  I remember growing up to this album.  I had it on vinyl and now have added it to my CD collection.  Thanks Amazon.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|For the price, this little gadget does a swell job. I bought this to replace a stolen E5 Amplifier. This is a nice improvement as it is light weight and makes good earphones sound stellar. Really, cheers for FiiO. They definately are a company to take seriously.
B00003CXWV|5.0|As a urban novelist consumer on kindle, i decided to give this a try. Based on true events excellent rags to riches to well you gotta see it.  Don't want to spoil too much.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|While this pair of earphones are more expensive than I generally want to pay, they are quality and produce an enjoyable fullness of sound.  I pair this with a FiiO e6 personal amplifyer (about 25 dollar gadget) and voila....  symphonic excellence!  Together I get a richness of sound that has bass and treble and everything between. It really improves personal movie watching on my Nexus 7.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star rating because it was a beautiful book. It expresses the feelings of Katniss and Peeta. The book also had lots of adventure added to make the book more fun and interesting. Over all, I really liked this book.
1608871827|5.0|Just arrived in the mail today.  Book is very detailed about how the movie came about, the movie characters, including both the Jaegers and Kaijus as well.  So much information to look over.  Worth the money that I paid for it and more.  Well written and put together.  Love the book.  Can't wait to see the movie when it comes out.  If you want to see the movie &#34;Pacific Rim&#34;, you should get this book.  I highly recommend getting it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|this is totally worth buying. I thought it was epic on the computer but this. this. omg. worth the money. good work ninja kiwi. (:  :3  :D perfectionnnnn
0785153942|5.0|Book explains what happens prior to the movie.  What happens to certain movie characters and how the Jaegers got started.  Well written.  Can't wait to see the movie itself.
B000F8O35U|3.0|The movie disc one arrived in good condition.  The case does not hold both disc's as it should.  One disc keeps falling out.  I did not play the 2nd disc until recent and it does not play.  I can not return because I have had both disc's for a while.  I would just make sure that if you are buying a used disc make sure to try all disc's at the beginning when they arrive to make sure that they play.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Started reading this book after I saw the movie which I loved! Keeps you on your toes and never bored!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love minecraft<br />Minecraft minecraft minecraft.<br />Must get<br />Must have<br />Must Love minecraft<br />Awesome  game to have<br />There is cow's,pigs,sheep,and chickens
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Love this book so much and it really draws the reader in and makes you feel like you are really there.
B00BTLOOAQ|4.0|I  like it im not a jazz head her voice is soothing she's very voluptious I  dont think  that has anything  to do with the quality of the music...but ehh lol its cool album to vibe out to in the car or drinks with friends if you like Gregory Porter youll love this..
B0029ATTAQ|3.0|Interesting movie. iHad forgotten a lot of the movie especially the nudity which iDon't think does anything for telling any story.<br />But, as for the way things are going with obama iThought it would be a harsh reminder of what can and will happen if 'We The People...shut our eyes and believe the lie's. We as Americans need to stay AWAKE!!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|I think its out of the box weird,bold disrespectful and a myriad of things that i like whats not like to like about ye...
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. I liked it more than I thought. It wasn't scary at all. Very entertaining.
B001BKAEHW|3.0|got me to buy this album its got some good songs this isnt really my kind of music, to me John Mayer is in the news for more than who he's dating than his artistry guess I can say I bought this  because of the former...
B000BISBDY|5.0|Johnny Cash is one of my all time favorite performers and this album is all great songs of his. I would recommend it to any Cash fan.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I started playing this game on Facebook. I love this game! I waiting for the rest of the Saga games to come on board!
B004U52VPS|5.0|My daughter likes it very much. Sience her ager is 3 years old, she just like the birds and not able to fix the sticks.
B002QP145C|5.0|No film conveys the national essence of a county as well as Talvisota conveys Finnish culture. Moreover, this is one of the very best war films ever made. This film is required for anyone interested in Finland, World War II or military history. One of the three best war movies ever made.
0062238868|5.0|well written, honest account of this person's experiences.  some of these types of accounts can be interesting, although hard to get through.  This was a page-turner.  Incredibly sad how Chris Kyle's life was ended (not in this book, just happened recently).  Chris Kyle was a true American & we were lucky to have him serve our country.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book reminded me a lot of Fifty Shades of Grey. Although it did have a different story and the female character was rich for which she did not need or want Gideon' s money. But I could not help but compare the whole time. I am looking forward to the next book.
B000066SBB|3.0|I am overall disappointed with the quality.  The sound is not  great and I feel that not much thought went into making this sound track.  It seems as if the songs were just &#34;thrown&#34; up in the air and whatever fell was recorded.  Such a shame because it does no justice to this great artist.
B0054SMID0|3.0|Although the movie is entertaining and worth watching, Matthew McConaughey does not fit the novel's character. Mickie Haller is a robust, slightly gruff character who doesn't blink when it comes to crossing ethical lines.  McConaughey is too pretty and naturally radiates a moral glow, thereby making him unconvincing in this role.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|If you read the book you are going to be disappointed.  I don't know why the director changed so much. If you did not read the book its ok, you won't know the difference.  .
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|The movie is entertaining.  The title is fitting since it is amazing how well the movie gives the ILLUSION that Ed Norton is such a handsome, macho and brilliant magician.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Bought for my Grandchildren don't ever play  this game or any other myself ,but I am sure they have been enjoying it!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is soooo all over the place. But in an excellent way. I love all the different stories going on. The actors are so talented in this show. They start as one personality and completely chane by the end of the season. I never thought to even watch this show, but I was very happily surprised when I did.
B004XVN1T4|4.0|This is the fifth time I have read this book.  It is one of four Follett books stored in my Kindle.  I just love this book.  It has very interesting characters and a great story.  Plenty of action and suspense.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Tame Disney like movie with good special effects does a nice job of telling the story. And, isn't any scarier than the one made years ago
B00CF34B2I|4.0|8Using Kindle Fire HD 8.9 with OS  8.4.3<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sound glitch happens frequently between menu screen changes or going back to a menu after a duel. It sounds like the first second or less of the menu song clipping on infinite loop. (Yes, I have cleared memory and reboot the Kindle.)<br /><br />Upon the Kindle going into hibernation, the same audio glitch has happened making the device still put out sound while the screen is powered down.  Then after 5-10 seconds, the speakers pop a few times need for stopping the audio loop.<br /><br />PROS:<br />MTG presented in all of its glory. Fun story arc &amp; all of the collection and customization you could ask for.<br /><br />Tutorials that make the game accessible to even complete CCG novices.<br /><br />Challenging matches against the computer opponent mean that you can play your favorite card game when no player are to be found.<br /><br />==========<br /><br />Were it not for how frequently the audio glitches occur, this would be the most solid 5 star game I have found for the Kindle. I will change my rating if they patch this problem.
0425263924|5.0|Awesome, hot, sexy. Could not put the book down. Cannot wait for the next Gideon Cross book! Keep them coming.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|I love any movie by Miyazaki. The characters in his movies are believable,  and by the end of the movie I believe I am watching a live action movie instead.
B005SAP45I|5.0|Great movie for kids of all ages.  Should be in everyone's collection of movies for when the grand kids come over.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Fun game but why doesn't the app allow me to review my messages/requests from friends? I get to use my 5 lives & can't access lives or extras my friends have given through the app. Also app should allow you pick some friends that you want to send stuff to & not just randomly pop up a few friends occasionally.
1881273377|5.0|I love, love, love this book.  I have given it to several people as a wedding gift.  It is such a simple idea and makes such sense...but like any relationship, it still requires work, this just makes it easier.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game!  My grand children love to play it.  So do I!  Its not an easy one.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|This is a solid performer.  The graphics from this APU are good for all users up to moderate gamers.  For more advanced gamers there are other options, even with this APU.  The CPU performance of this APU is top drawer handling everything tossed at it with ease.
B0088D3PYE|4.0|I cannot view this book as a standalone book. It works more as a bridge between the two previous and the final yet to come one. Still the story has the vivacity of the first book and keeps the reader hooked. I liked it but not as much as the other two.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|My four year old loves this game and luckily, since he can't write yet, the autocorrect feature on the kindle fire gives him items for playing similar to what he writes. He loves it!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Very good book.  I kept imagining the character were the ones on the tv show &#34;Castle&#34;.  If you like mysteries this is a good one.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This is by far my favorite game. I love playing this every day. The sounds and effects are exciting and the explosions of jewels give me such a rush. I love moving on to the next levels. There are other games on here as well that I enjoy very much. Awesome game!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Although season 3 had more sadness than joy, I still greatly love the show. I can't wait for season 4.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Who knew that my son would love this game more than angry birds! He loves creating different kinds of vehicles for the piggies and he cracks up whenever they fall apart. He finds it very entertaining. It is a great game.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I downloaded the free app on my tablet for my son to play, but unbeknownst to me, I paid over $140 for the game. I found out later that he inadvertently purchased gems and coins at $20 per 300 gems. This is the most expensive app I've ever purchased. Surely, I will &#34;uninstall&#34; the app and suggest that you shouldn't bother downloading the game.
B0098XY5VK|5.0|This is a great game for the multi-tasker. It keeps you very busy while on demand from the customers. It is highly entertaining.
B004LWZW42|5.0|This is the movie that legitimately got me into superheroes.<br />I did not watch any of the Wolverine or X-Men movies before picking this one up. Now I am not only hooked, but steadily becoming a true X-Men fan.<br />It is all in the acting.<br />James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender (and the writers who created Charles Xavier and Magneto) made this film the great movie it is. I loved Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, and everyone else did a great job as well, but it was McAvoy and Fassbender that end up carrying the show.<br />For the action junkies: spectacular fight scenes. For the romantics: I don't care if you do not ship Professor X/Magneto, you will by the end of this movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book was great.  I was just mad that it was continued.  I thought it was a trilogy.  Writers should have their outlines for a whole series so it isn't so long between books.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love the Crossfire Series, I thought this book was absolutely amazing and cant wait for the next book to come out. I will continue to read and love the characters I fell in love with in the very first book. I would highly recommend this series to anyone who want a great story with some hot and steamy characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absolutely love this game it's very addictive . I just can't seem to put my tablet down I even find myself staying up all night until the sun rises.  I love love love this game
B00821OX98|4.0|Noah Wylie and cast give a good nights entertainment.  The material is interesting but then, it is Stephen Speilberg!  Watch it!!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|I really truly enjoyed this movie, I wish my wife was into CGI movies.<br /><br />The pacing, storyline, and visuals are just great for an all-CGI movie.  I enjoyed it much more than Polar Express.<br /><br />CHILDREN: Around minute 9, a man gets machine-gun shot in the back, falls on his face, and dies; while you don't see the bullets permeating his body, it's all implied, and that is the most violent part of the movie. I don't know what age that is appropriate for.  The purpose was to clearly show how far the villian would go to get what he wants, but it may be the deciding factor to letting my children see it.<br /><br />There is heavy drinking done by the sailor, but it's mostly comic relief for the storyline.  As a parent, I don't think kids even understand drunkenness and its moral/ethical implications in a movie, so I don't have a problem with that.
B005LAII80|5.0|After the first Judge Dredd movie I was hesitant to watch this one...But upon watching this movie, I was blown away by it. It has a raw-sexy cool feel, the casting was perfect and the acting was on par. The story itself was really good as well. But the gritty and sharp soundtrack has to be one of the best movie soundtracks I've ever heard. It goes perfect with the dark and violent movie. This is truly a cult classic that I would definitely recommend.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Dope album, I consider Cole, Wale and K.Dot the new legends in place of Kanye , Naw and Jay. Future legend
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The bible version I want.<br />The bible reading plan I want.<br />The convenience I need.<br /><br />And now the things I don't like:<br /><br />(Wait a minute, I'm thinking...)
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|l love this game but sometimes when I open the tab it closes even when I don't press the on button
B00486070K|5.0|Compare to the after market product that require to load drivers genuine apple product just work no hassle with try to download driver or spending hour on Google it just works. that's why I love genuine Apple product.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I've read all the sookie Stackhouse dead books except the newest one - & so far (the first 2 of season 1)  the program follows the intent of the books pretty well
B003SI3URQ|5.0|My daughter found this and has watched it enough times to recite it by memory.  It is a great show for kids.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Oh my gosh. I am hooked the stories within the stories are crazy good. Haven't heard of anyone not getting into it
B004UPANAI|5.0|Hugh Jackman is incredible, once again.  Lev Schreiber is excellent, too.  The whole cast is wonderful and it is really satisfying to know Wolverine's story.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Good game play  some sections drag. The graphics are good. Crashes infrequently. Controls are limited because of the tablet  interface.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|On the first level I could not open the dyawer. Ether it's just me or I'm not doing it right.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This show brings on lots of laughs. Sheldon is so much fun to watch as he annoys and irritates his &#34;friends&#34; with his idiosyncrasies.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was ok, quick and funny read, but I think Kinney could do better. Only get this if you want a short read, not a long emotional novel.
B008LXZFH6|5.0|Will Ferrell and Steve Carrell are especially impressive in this comedy about the risibility of male chauvinism and the resilience of a fallen news anchor.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love game. The effects are awesome. I have become obsessed it is such a good game. Everybody needs this app.
6304406096|5.0|No matter what age you are, no matter which 007 movie he is in--Sir Connery lives up to his James Bond image and you will enjoy this movie!
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|This game only provides just flying around , shooting , and stopping to shoot evil soldiers. Before I was really excited,now I feel like I'm in a TV being rewinded. (Doing the same thing over and over)
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Not sure how I feel about the \\"then and now\\". I didn't like bouncing back and forth, but I did like how the story went and its outcome. Can't wait to start reading the next one. I like the way Lauren Oliver writes.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app help me with the percentage of the battery.  it helps by telling how much percents I have left in order to charge.  anyway I just love it. it just like a phone.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Love it !!!! got them for me to watch but I am sharing them with friends and family. Movie quality is great. prompt delivery. very satisfied customer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The most frustrating thing about this game is that - at present- there are only 10 levels. Can we please have some more soon?
0333961447|3.0|My four year old loves this book!  It's great.  He talks on and on about different &#34;spiffy&#34; clothes.  (He wants to wear a tie because of this book!!)<br /><br />However, this is the British version.  The English version is titled, &#34;The Spiffiest Giant in Town&#34;.  The British notion of &#34;Smart&#34; is much different from that of Americans (who assume that a &#34;smart&#34; something is intellectually gifted).  In this book, &#34;smart&#34; means &#34;well dressed&#34;.  For American audiences, I highly recommend the American version: &#34;The Spiffiest Giant in Town&#34;.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|A great family movie based on a true story. I mevet get tired of watching this film. This film will please everyone in the family from grandpa to the teenager in the  house.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The show is very cheesy, but it is growing on me. Aliens in rubber suits take me back to my childhood days.
B0062OCNAI|5.0|I read this for book club and was blown away. I can't say enough nice things. Original, developed, poignant, thought-provoking. I highly recommend this book. so far best read of the summer.
B001KZG99A|3.0|For an &#34;action&#34; movie, I found this to be a really slow moving film. I wanted non-stop action and I didn't really get that.
B004XD03RK|2.0|Don't like this CD...thought it would be better. Heard it once before and it sounded better when I don't own.
B000VWSINI|5.0|I just recently purchased this album and love the feeling and it takes me back to a place of excitement- just turning 18/19, going out to clubs for the first year, etc.<br />He's definitely pondering something deep in the back of his mind- I feel like the skits go a bit too far at alienating his female listeners and turning men into a-holes, but aside from that- it really shows how he is a genius at dissecting all of his thoughts and feelings about present circumstances and creating songs.. At the time, I wasn't a big Eminem fan- but I do remember listening to it and really \\"getting it\\"- why he is such a success and how talented he is at transporting the listener into another realm. Much more than just a one hit wonder..<br />I'm glad that I bought this album recently, because it makes me feel that excitement once again and this time, I can forget all the bad stuff I was going through and move on. Just keep the good stuff.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Very insightful.  An excellent contribution.  Well written and intellectually honest.  Show's again that intelligent folks who are not credentialed &#34;experts&#34; in an area often have better insights that the so-called experts because they are not trapped by the conventional wisdom
B0030DD9I4|4.0|I really like this album. I can really identify with his lyrics and the general mood and feel it fills a gap in the world of music. I love My Music Box which seems like an ironically funny take on passive aggressive and control disorders and Deja Vu which describes a listless lingering want that dissipates when reality settles down and one is still left with the absence of meaningness or being. I like the transition into each new track, but especially like Tanya into Same Song and Dance. (Although on shuffle, it's best to just leave Tanya out of the equation).. But it really flows nicely from one to the next. It's kind of just as one of the pictures on the booklet suggests- Em sitting in a tub of blood- looking like a deranged serial killer, like Yep. I did it. Of course there are a couple of songs that I don't appreciate as much such as Elevator and My Darling- which I was hoping My Darling to be one of the more bittersweet songs that really hooks a girl in, but wasn't. Overall though- it takes me away to a place where I feel at ease for feeling disorientated and disconnected with reality. A place where I feel connected and enjoy that feeling of things fitting more into place; giving me a catalyst to focus on my inside issues.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|reasonable good take on the classic story. animations of the giants is first rate, not so much when they interact with humans in the fight scenes. some glitches in the story like whatever happened to the bean stalk that falls and almost smashes the castle? lots of action after the first 20 minutes of context between Jack and princess. Would watch it again when it comes out on netflix or redbox, streamed well the first time on our playstation, not so later on the computer
B00C70FH7M|5.0|This band is incredible! Wonderful odd meters, heavy and atmospheric. I have waited to hear this for some time now and I'm not disappointed
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Intriguing relationships, mother-son, father-son, husband-wife, brotherhood, and mother-girlfriend-wife. Couldn't stop watching past seasons. Could use less violence but Can't wait until next season begins!
B00C3MKCIS|4.0|Really cool prog from Simon Collins and Dave Kerzner . The song Mobius Slip is very epic in multiple ways. Worthy of checking out.
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Not for the faint of heart. I enjoyed but wife was not impressed with the blood and violence and language.
B004LROUNG|5.0|First Grisham I've picked up in a few years and couldn't put it down!!!  You won't be disappointed at all.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love, love the third book. I hope there is more to come because there some unanswer questions and situation. Steamy HOT,are all the love scenes. Love the way Ms. Day described every single detail. I'm in love with Gideon Cross!!!!!!!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|this is a great ap. I can take my kindle to any part of the house or the yard and listen to sports from all over the country as well as all types of music and it's so convenient.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|The author probably didn't go over this twice and thrice, making sure every paragraph  was put together well. All the same, it's an inspiration work. Thumbs up.
B004WO9F56|5.0|You of course decline, only to discover that slot went to Iron Maiden!!!<br />So you change your mind & still get a headline slot.<br />Yes, Avantasia is that much in demand.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have a hard time waiting until January. My sister got me started on this series and I absolutely love it. It is a good mix between the rich and the servants. What a great story line.
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Awesome movie, special events, great DVD/HD DVD experience. You won't be disappointed if you purchase this video, I sure wasn't!
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|But since I've purchased the premium version on my toshiba android tablet I've had problems. Game closes after every round.  Can't get past Rome. I've loaded, deleted and reloaded app. Nothing helps. Great game though. Plays well on my smaller kindle fire. Sure wish it worked on larger tablet!
B009NY43NY|5.0|I enjoyed the story, the beginning was a bit convoluted but if you stick with the story, everything comes together...I hope this is not the last Sookie Stackhouse installment
B000J103OI|4.0|Funny movie. Friends of Anne Hathaway not much for friends. No support at all. I would be looking for other friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The updated version is even better because now you get to play survival so I highly recommend to get this game if you love minecraft.
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Thor handily manages the twin tricky tasks of leavening its story with humor and of rendering a world based on Norse mythology believable in a modern context.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|This is a perfect way to see how she got her start in singing and performing. It shows her early years.
B005IQZB14|5.0|What a great read of an amazing adventure. Finding one's self in nature, struggle, and and a journey riddled in pain.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this game is fun and the game play is very smooth. great details and plenty of help items. love it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again!  And the Mountains Echoed is a fantastic book chalked full of wonderfu stories.  I couldn't put it down.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|ESV is one of the best translations available today.  This is easy to read, but retains the true interpretations behind the manuscripts.  My only wish is that you could toggle the superscripts off in the Kindle version.  Almost every other word has a superscript reference to a note.  It's really excessive when you're trying to read the Kindle version.
B00AAIHAGO|1.0|The movie froze twice during playback.  My family won't have time to get together and try again with in 24 hours.  Amazon's recommendation is to call and leave my phone number for immediate call back.  Sounds good right?  No, you just get a typical voice menu and are told to hold for the next available representative.  I do not have this problem with Netflix streaming, or any other video streaming, such as youtube.  Just Amazon.  I have had to pay twice for movies several times because of this issue, so be warned.  This isn't an odd occurrence.
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|Almost no dialogue, very little action.  When things did occur, it was predictable.<br /><br />I'd give this less than one star if Iir was allowed.  Can I give this movie the finger?
B00125WAWS|1.0|This is a illegal copy of &#34;1THE GREAT DEBATERS&#34; AND  it is copied on a DVD RW. I would not recommend it to anyone.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Best shows ever. Love the story lines between all the characters. Need to acquire Seasons 1-6 for my collection at home.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|After getting this app it took my other app and erased half of the data I had for it.<br /><br />It was another cute little gameloft game.<br /><br />When you download please be careful.
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|This movie and its title serve as a particularly fitting eulogy to Hollywood.  From 1939's unforgettable masterpiece of cinematic art to this most recent empty, meaningless, unimaginative, unmitigated piece of excrement that represents what Hollywood has become, we have a concrete metaphor of the birth, rise, fall, and demise of yet another pillar of American culture.  RIP.  Hollywood died long ago.  It is now a rotting corpse that is stinking up the air and polluting the landscape.  Someone do the decent thing and throw some dirt on it.  Please.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|I was so shocked that I actually liked THE DICTATOR.  Though I did like 'Borat', I found Sacha Baron Cohen highly irritating in 'Hugo' (a film I didn't like, anyway, though), and I always found the commercials for 'Bruno' more annoying than anything else.  But when I saw Cohen in 'Les Misreables' I loved both him and Helena Bonham Carter so much, I had to try this film.  And was hugely surprised that it had an actual, linear storyline, instead of seeming like a bunch of spontaneous or ad-libbed \\"interviews\\" featuring yet another of Cohen's bizarre characters!<br /><br />Here Cohen plays Hafez Aladeen, hateful, oppressive, uncaring (and kind of stupid) leader of the republic of Wadiya, over which he rules with an iron hand - and lots of punishment for anyone who even annoys him.  Called to New York City to speak in front of the UN about his shady dealings with Wadiya's nuclear weapons program, Aladeen ends up in trouble when his second-in-command Tamir (the awesome Ben Kingsley) betrays him, replacing Aladeen with a double while also inadvertently getting Aladeen himself tossed onto the mean streets of NYC - where the evil dictator immediately meets/clashes with Zoey (Anna Faris), a left-wing feminist revolutionary determined to make her \\"cause\\" known during Aladeen's visit to the States.<br /><br />The film even gets a bit rom-com, between Aladeen and Zoey, but Cohen lovers needs not fear - there are PLENTY of off-color jokes and sight-gags on hand, some maybe determined to test the gag reflex.  The jokes are hit and miss, but Cohen certainly throws everything into the pot, and overall while not great this is an enjoyable enough off-color comedy that keeps Cohen's blue humor a bit in check, even as he works in his usual ad-libbed bizarreness when he can.  Not great but worth a look, and definitely (I feel) a step up from Cohen's usual fare.<br /><br />(Just an FYI, I did NOT see the \\"Banned and Unrated\\" version, just the regular R-rated version released in theaters; I hear there are significant changes between the two, so will be catching the unrated/banned version when I can.  For now, this was enough!)I hear there are significant changes between the two, so will be catching the unrated/banned version when I can.  For now, this was enough!)

B005S9EJ14|5.0|One of my favorite films I've seen this year is the charming, funny, and heartwarming treat THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL, which contains a handful of my favorite actors working today.  The story is about seven retirement-age Brits, each for reasons of his or her own decide to answer an ad and relocate to India, to the posh/upscale (yet very affordable) Best Exotic Marigold Hotel which has been specifically geared for retirees.<br /><br />There is Graham (Tom Wilkinson), on a mission to find a lost love; Doug and Jean (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton), who have lost most of their money in a bad investment in their daughter's online company; Muriel (Maggie Smith), a grouchy bigot who needs hip replacement surgery and can only get it right away in India; Evelyn (Judi Dench), a widow who feels she's lost her place in the world; Madge (Celia Imrie), on the hunt for a rich husband; and Norman (Ronald Pickup), the eternal skirt chaser who still fancies himself a ladies man even in his \\"golden years\\".<br /><br />All seven meet on the way to India, and upon arrival realize that the hotel depicted in the ads/brochure is by far NOT the rundown, shabby, badly-in-need of repair former palace that lies before them - run by Sonny (the ever-brilliant Dev Patel), who has so much energy and so much heart, and is determined to do everything he can to get the money needed so he can restore the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel (\\"Now with Guests!\\" as the sign he soon puts out front reads) back to its former glory.<br /><br />India, depicted as a patchwork of sound and noise and people - lots and LOTS of people - affects each of the seniors in a different way.  But each of them IS affected, most of them deeply, and the film is not only a love letter to India but also a love letter to the human spirit that lives - and can be rekindled - in us all, no matter how old we are or how far withdrawn from life we feel we've become.  Funny, enchanting, beautifully written and with a perfect cast, it's a film that will touch your heart without going overboard into sentiment.  A lovely, inspiring film.film that will touch your heart without going overboard into sentiment.  A lovely, inspiring film.
B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Intellectually demanding in a fun action-packed way. If you love sci-fi time travel, see this movie!!! You may need to watch it more than once but you won't mind!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We don't have any children, but my husband and I both love this movie.  We may have watched it 3 times the weekend after purchase.  I am glad we bought it and we are considering going to see the sequel once the first wave of watchers clears out.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Finally Bubble Witch is on the Kindle. I love this game on Facebook and now can love it on my kindle. So far not any problems, hope it stays that way.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book series was one of the best 3 books I have read in a long time.  We actually passed them around my office.  Great, fun read and you keep wanting more books to come out.  I loved it.  Highly recommend.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|AWESOME COOL AND SOOOOO MUCH MORE!!!!!!!!!!!! I LOVED both bear and daisy because they are dogs go dogs!I also can't imagine what it's like being August. You aren't strange but everyone thinks you are. Also  I liked the popular group because I can relate to them except for Julian who is incredibly mean. Plus summer's pretty \\"cool beans\\" spoiler make my review a good one please!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved this book.  The title was what initially grabbed me.  His writing is so beautiful, even when writing about clearly depressing situations. It seems the wait between books that are this compelling is a very long time.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|So as we all know the Goonies is the Pepsi generation film we have grown up watch as kids.  It has all the things any young boy or girl would want.  Comedy, romance, drama, action and pirates! The movie is based off a Steven Spielberg book.  Though he was a excecutive producer and not the director the movie still managed to be a huge hit back then till present.  I recommend you watch again or get the younger generation to watch it.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|i just love stories like this.  Emma is a family name of mine.  She is very funny and smart, if i lived in that time it could have been me!
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|This movie was well done, but the subject matter was a little depressing to me.  It was very action-packed throughout.
B003QF8E4A|5.0|wow. a must watch for any Leo DiCaprio fan, or for anyone who likes plot-twisty, &#34;holy crap moment&#34; movies. definitely loved it.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Ms. Charlaine outdid herself for this finale!  I really liked it and was happy with the ending.  I was able to hide from the spoilers that were leaked a few weeks ago.  I had no clue how this book would go and I enjoyed every letter of it!
B002WV5A9G|5.0|So i actually wasn't a fan of the original Star Trek series, but being kind of a sci-fi fan in general i thought i would give this movie a try and it was well worth a watch. a modernized experience brought to a classic franchise was actually done very well, and gives viewers a great story and cool overall experience. well done.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Every one of the cast is absolutely superb. I've watched it five times and can't wait to see it again.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's great but their was this glitch were everything is free and now it won't load and it always says their is a new version of world at arms and  I already downloaded it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved it . The book was full of shocking and interesting moments that no one would even expect. This book was amazing
B00633W614|3.0|It's not a cannot-put-down book but the characters and plot were interesting enough to make me want to know what happened to them.  I would not recommend it to anyone unless someone asked me to name a book to read while on holidays or travelling.
0061367036|1.0|This book is not a fun make-believe book of make believe creatures. Not only does the author talk about the real realm of spirits and demons, but he even outlays witchcraft and spells. Be Careful what you ask for!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun but hard i had to go on YouTube to find some things out. But i still like this game.
B002SZAU1Y|4.0|Good well-written book. Easy to read, a little bit depressing though.  I like the style of C. Ahern and I enjoyed reading all of her books.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is one of the best series ever.  Excellent characters, well acted and the plot is always moving.  Good reason why it won Emmys!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This as amazing. I loved the ending and how the book kept you on the edge of your seat. When she lost Prim I about cried, it really felt like it was happening to m e too.

B00COO2D6O|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  Each level I played has been winnable.  I have found no real need for in app purchase, although it is away to advance quicker.  It has smooth game play and I have found no glitches as of yet.

B005LAII80|1.0|If I can give zero, I will but that is very hard of me to rate such movie cos the graphics were good. The only problem was judge dredd never even took off his helmet like other judges do for the entire movie at all lol. The area of scenes were very limited. The fighting and killing were very brutal and very scary if that will be the law enforcer in real life lol.  If I can return it, I will but its waste if my money again for return shipping.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|This movie is breathtaking! It captivates you right away.  It kept me at the edge of my seat. This is one of those movies that you continue to think about long after your finished viewing it.

B004ZQRFGM|5.0|This is the first material I have heard by Ann Popovic, she is just a pleasure to listen to.  Her voice is perfect and her instrumentals tight and crisp.  She does the blues so well. I look forward to hearing more from her.<br /><br />At first I was drawn in by a woman posing nude on her album cover. I figured I'll give her a listen to see if she deserves respect for honesty and integrity, but the tracks are where she earns that respect.

1596438274|4.0|Nobel-laureate Physicist Richard Feynman (1918-1988) has been the subject of countless biographical treatments, due not only because of his multifarious scientific achievements, but because of his quirky, relentlessly honest and direct, character.  The quote on the cover alludes to this: \\"If that's the world's smartest man, God help us.\\"  The sheer number of biographical treatments about him in print, on film, and online mean that finding something new to say about him is difficult, and this book finds essentially nothing new to say. But the WHAT to say is not the point of this book.  It's the HOW to say it that matters...which is akin to Feynman's own obsession with HOW to explain his insights to others, how to educate them.  And Feynman was indeed an innovator in this, coming up with his \\"wriggly lines\\" to explain the interaction in space and time of photons and electrons as part of his Nobel-prize winning contributions to Quantum Electrodynamics.  In short, he gave scientists and the lay public a visible mnemonic device to enable understanding.  And this is precisely what writer Jim Ottaviani and artist Leland Myrick give us in this wonderful biography, which epitomizes the new and ever more popular genre of graphic non-fiction...a story told in illustrations like a comic book, appealing to the broadest possible readership. I noticed several details in the excursus that deserve consideration.  When I watch television programs I generally engage the closed captioning, because of a growing age-related deficit of hearing.  I am amused to see on this captioning notes like \\"indistinct conversation,\\" or \\"speaking in a foreign language,\\" which are labels to explain auditory unintelligibility.  In this work on Feynman, Ottaviani and Myrick have \\"indistinct speech\\" rendered not with labels but with transliterational simulacra--\\"mugga wugga mugga, mugga mugga wugga...\\"  At another place when they want to indicate iconically the reaction of an audience that is unable to understand Feyman's explanations of quantum electrodynamics they have the \\"speech balloons\\" in their illustrations read the audience's questions BACKWARDS.  The backwards questions indicate their \\"backwardness\\" in understanding in an iconic fashion, something this visible format significantly enables.  In the print come permutations of Feynman's chants, and a segmentation of the word \\"in-ter-es-ting\\" where it appears.  Even the \\"functional load\\" of the word \\"fool\\" plays a role, appearing 14 times in the text to relate Feynman's attitude toward himself and others who advance science by \\"having fun with it.\\"  But the format enables some confusions as well.  There are several places where a character is shown whose identity is not clear.  I had to make notes \\"which 'Bob\\" is this?\\" or \\"Who's Ralph?\\"  Even his sister Joan is visibly introduced in a way that a reader not already acquainted with Feynman's family life might confuse with a girlfriend.  But, all in all, I think that Ottaviani, clearly a kindred soul of Feynman's himself, and Myrick have significantly extended the boundaries of this new genre with this treatment.  This is, in my opinion, the very best \\"Feynman for Dummies\\" available and I recommend it highly.erstand Feyman's explanations of quantum electrodynamics they have the \\"speech balloons\\" in their illustrations read the audience's questions BACKWARDS.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book because the story line flowed well with the previous books.  It was so well written that it held my attention throughout the whole reading.  Also, I did not expect the final outcome, although it was befitting to the circumstances and events within the story.  I, personally, would have liked a different final outcome; one with less sadness.  But again, it seemed more true to life because life is never perfect.

B00887490Y|4.0|This is the first time I've seen Jessica Biel as a dramatic lead. I think she was stellar.<br /><br />The way it starts, you'll probably assume things will happen a certain way. Later one you'll think you were clearly wrong. And then later still you'll see it's something different entirely. This was not predictable in the way that so many American movies tend to be.<br /><br />While there could have been a wee bit more explanation, there was still enough for me to feel satisfied at the end.
B008JFUQ16|5.0|I loved this movie and both my daughters loved it even more. It is AS GOOD as the first part, therefore this review follows the main lines of my review of the first \\"Despicable me\\". This review contains very limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />1. Hilarity - Exactly as the first film, this sequel is HILARIOUS! There is hardly any 15 seconds in this movie that would not contain a really good gag, children or/and adult oriented. Whoever wrote the scenario was a genius!<br /><br />2. Despicability - in this film Gru is a little bit different from what he was in the first part. He is no more so grumpy, mean, petty and permanently aggravated - he certainly smiles more and all his attitude softened. He remains however exactly as insecure as in the first film. That being said, there are moments in this film when the old Gru resurfaces, when his heart is broken or when somebody REALLY upsets him. His geriatric sidekick and only friend (well, kind of) doctor Nefario didn't take all this change easily and he has some trouble to adapt his evil laboratory to new tasks of producing jam and jelly... Gru's murderous (and toxic) dog/rat/wolverine/skunk like pet on another hand felt completely under the spell of the girls - but still gives a great show! The two \\"bad guys\\" are also excellent - which is a real achievement, considering that one of them belongs to species usually not associated with evil villainy...)))<br /><br />3. Girl power - as in the previous film, I believe that any parent of little girls will fall immediately in love with Margo, Edith and Agnes, the three little orphaned sisters Gru adopted in the first part. Those seemingly defenseless creatures took him since under the sweet and soft but in the same time surprisingly totalitarian control little girls exercise over their fathers, adoptive or not...))) Agnes, the youngest of the three (I think she is 5) is still particularly sweet - if only she was real I would adopt her on the spot and spoil her silly all the rest of my life! Tomboyish Edith, aged around 8, still wears permanently her pink hat which seems to comfort her, but as you will see, she certainly recovered from her previous traumas...))) Margo, the oldest one, is now a young teenager (she is about 13 I think) and starts already to think about boys, something which TERMINALLY freaks Gru out - and I can relate here! Honest, if you already are a parent of a little girl, you WILL LOVE this movie. And if you do not have yet a young daughter, get one!<br /><br />4. As in previous film, as far as reasons to watch this movie go, even the girls must cede the first place to the minions! The totally devoted, fearless and highly professional and in the same time impossibly immature and conflicted army of Gru minions is THE greatest treasure of this movie. In this film there is even more minions and believe me - they pack incredible fun! I am very impatient to see their own film (which I believe will be released in 2014).<br /><br />5. Agent Lucy Wilde, a young rising star in the Anti Villain League, is a new element and a new delight added to this film and her character is a great success. Well trained in martial arts and using some extremely cool gadgets, she is also a mixture of perfect lady and a tomboyish, contagiously enthusiastic adventurer, still lacking a little bit of experience and therefore prone to attack first and ask questions later...))) And she is also cute, which certainly doesn't hurt.<br /><br />I purposefully omitted in this review some of the characters and did not hint at most of the gags and scenes, to avoid big spoilers and keep things short.<br /><br />To conclude, this is a TREASURE OF A MOVIE. A thing to see in cinema, then buy on DVD, watch, keep and re-watch on regular basis. And I ABSOLUTELY hope for A SECOND SEQUEL!<br /><br />PS. LONG LIVE MINIONS!life!

0307477479|5.0|I think if art is going to be effective -- if it is \\"good\\" art -- it resonates so powerfully that nearly anyone who encounters it says, \\"Oh my God. That's me. But how could someone I have never met know?\\" Yeah. That's this book.<br /><br />A Visit from the Good Squad -- constructed as a series of stories connected only by the human connections of Egan's characters-- is genius. I don't know that I have ever read a story that quite so astutely holds a mirror up to our 21st century lives like this one does. As we walk around (or even sit) with our faces perpetually turned toward our phones, we become absorbed in a kind of horrifying myopia. We forget that we are all connected -- that we are in this together -- that \\"no man is an island,\\" but here Egan reminds us that we're all on the same team -- and of course, she also reminds us that time is a beast that comes for us all regardless of how many toys and distractions we add to our lives. This book is painfully sobering and honest -- (and considering some of the reviews I've read for this book) perhaps a bit too honest for some.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|it is, i swear to god, so good, that trying to explain it with words would just sully it. So. AMAZING.
1400067820|3.0|Antifragile  by Nassim Taleb<br /><br />Antifragility is a step beyond robustness and resilience. I find it easier to think of something as long term robust and improving with volatility, instead of Taleb's use of the word antifragile.  He looks at the aspects of the world that have been robust enough to last a long time and says they are antifragile -ok.  Later he finds that robust or resilient aspects are not changed by volatility and disorder, but the antifragile actually benefits from them.<br /><br />His use of vocabulary is a bit different. Luckily he provides a glossary, but it's not alphabetical. Its roughly in order that he uses the term so you have to page through to find a term, perhaps this is deliberate but not friendly.  He often uses a lot of allusions to ancient history.  In some cases such as expressing his disgust with what big bankers got away with in the last financial crises, it is very much to the point. From Hammurabi's code: If a builder builds a house and the house collapses and causes the death of the owner of the house-the builder shall be put to death. If it causes the death of a slave of the owner of the house-he shall give to the owner of the house a slave of equal value. In many other cases it is more like interpreting an oracle.<br /><br />He does provide a table of the 3 columns for three types of exposure: Fragile, Robust, and Antifragile.<br />Under the heading of finance he lists: Debt, Equity, Venture capital. For learning he lists: Classroom; Real Life; Real Life and library.  For Science and Technology he lists: Directed research; Opportunistic research; Stochastic, random tinkering  (using what's available).  Under another heading of Science he lists: Theory; Phenomenology (investigation of experience); Heuristics (problem-solving by trial and error).<br /><br />Examples of antifragile are bacteria getting exposed to antibiotics and the ones that survive get stronger. Another would be an airplane crash where careful analysis allows changes in the system to make another similar crash very unlikely. Still another is survival of the fittest in evolution.<br />Taleb gives an example of two brothers one is an employee of a big bank (Taleb really dislikes big banks), the other owns his own cab and is essentially his own boss. The bank employee is more fragile because he is more subject to a firing from above with little warning.  The taxi driver, who makes about the same salary, is constantly seeing how he is doing and making his own small decisions on how to keep profiting. His job is more antifragile.<br /><br />Another example in medicine around 400 children were in the 1930's were diagnosed by doctors and about half recommended for tonsillectomies. The healthy half were diagnosed by another group of doctors and about half of these were recommended for tonsillectomies, the remaining children were diagnosed by a third set of doctors and about half were recommended for tonsillectomies. That is a lot of tonsillectomies. He calls this iatrogenics when a doctor's interventions do more harm than good. To avoid this situation it is easier if you procrastinate rather than try to solve every problem whether medical, economic or other immediately. By waiting, we may understand the problem more completely, and give time and nature a chance to solve the problem. Taleb generalizes this to a general problem solving method.<br /><br />In many areas, investing for example, Taleb suggests using a barbell strategy. For instance put about 90% of wealth in something that is safe to preserve your wealth such as short term treasury bills, rental property, investments that should protect against inflation that he sees as a possibility. This is protection against negative black swans. The other 10% would be in situations that have the potential to pay off big- positive black swans.  He uses the black swan term from a previous book to be a very low probability event. This of course depends on your experience. One of my favorite bicycle routes goes by a pond that has two white swans, the next pond has two black swans. In my area they are equally probable.<br /><br />Taleb gives an example of Thales who was one of the first to try to explain Nature scientifically.  Using his ideas about Nature, Thales predicted a good harvest of olives and purchased an option before the harvest (perhaps the first recorded one) to use the olive presses in the area at a discount.  When the harvest turned out to be spectacular he was able to get a much higher price for the olive presses. He paid a relatively small amount to have the right to exercise the use of the presses so his downside was a fraction of what it would have been to actually rent the presses.  Limited downside with a huge possible payoff - this is where your 10% should be invested.  The resulting profit can buy you freedom to make yourself more robust.  You want a situation where you have the right to take advantage of a situation if it moves in a favorable direction, but not the obligation if it does not prove profitable.  In a rent controlled apartment if rents go higher you stay and pay a relatively low price, if rents drop you can try to find a cheaper apartment.<br /><br />Consider using wheels in an airport - wheels can be used to make a cart to carry luggage. It took quite awhile for someone to think of putting wheels directly on luggage.  In a similar fashion the Aztecs used logs under large stones to move them, and they used wheels on children's toys, but never connected the two to use wheels to transport heavy stones.<br /><br />The point is partially that great geniuses fail to see possible applications of ideas to new areas, and often the person who does is not a highly acclaimed genius.  Taleb gives a few examples: one a very successful commodity trader who traded green lumber (lumber that has not been dried), and thought it was lumber painted green, another the biggest Swiss currency trader didn't know where Switzerland was and had never been there. This leads him to one of his sweeping generalizations that the education level in a country has nothing to do with the business success of the nation.<br /><br />Another generalization is that most breakthroughs in science and technology are not accomplished through government programs or big company research, pharmaceutical research for instance.  He's not impressed with work done at universities, though he seems to forget the large number of researchers who have started new entrepreneurial companies and act as advisers to similar startups.<br /><br />He talks about concave and convex in a much different way than normal ([...] to little point.  Most of us know that in many cases corporate mergers do not work, and too big to fail banks are very fragile for society, but not for their executives. These people have vast power, which is increasingly concentrated. Most things you look at are not evenly distributed, for instance on a committee 20% of the people do 80% of the work. The trend in Internet traffic is getting more like 99/1, i.e., 99% of the traffic is through 1% of the most popular sites compared to the whole of Internet traffic.<br /><br />The idea is that you can tell what is antifragile by looking at items like shoes, books, types of drinks and food, that have been around for a long time more or less in the same form we presently use them.  His heroes are knights, warriors, prophets, artists, entrepreneurs, maverick scientists, municipal government, great writers, investigative journalists, rebels, and taxpayers.<br /><br />Taleb seems like someone you'd like to have as a seatmate on a long flight or dinner companion, conversation would never lag. Whether you would come away believing most of what you discussed is problematical, but he'd get you thinking about and defending your beliefs.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|Hard, but fun.....worth the very small charge. Can't wait to get to the planes with guns. Wish there was more scenarios.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Mr. Altucher has a winner here. I learned some very valuable life skills and  thought processes. I don't do everything he recommends, but the things I do use have really enriched my life.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|This is a good book and definitely worth the read but it seems to jump around a bit and the writing style almost seems to change page-by-page, leaving the reader to believe that several individuals had a hand in writing this book with its obvious high points and lulls.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and challenging game.  Can't wait for next levels. Hard and easy at the same time.  Makes you think.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|although this game captures the essence of mlp, it is not right that we should have to spend real money to level up and buy some items. it is outrageous. and I had gotten very far the game until, without warning, it just erased all my work. I am very upset about this. so, I uninstalled the game
B004XDYJRU|3.0|It was working really good. But now, does not tune many stations. many of my stations, I consider favorites I am not eable to listen any more. Because it won't tune them and other takes to long to catch. I think that now that this app has make their money has leaving us in the cold now.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great to play I enjoy playing can't stop playing my husband like playing  we is how many times we get  bingo
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The graphics and gameplay are amazing. The interface is very simple to use and having the game in my pocket is very convenient. I've been playing Magic the Gathering, off and on, for about 15 years now and I love how it's gone digital. Please keep up the excellent work Wizards of the Coast.
B008Y73940|5.0|We saw this in the theatre and really enjoyed it.  The book was very good with lots more detail.  It was just as good the second time watching it at home.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|It doesn't get any better than North by Northwest with Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. Would highly recommend this movie.
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|This movie was fast moving, great banter and the time went by really fast.  We missed it in the theatre and enjoyed watching it at home.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I have truly enjoyed reading this series. It is a little sad to realize this is the last one, but feel it did end well with most of the characters &#34;doing&#34; just what their characters should do.  An enjoyable series with truly lovable characters.
1432794426|5.0|Their are to many books out their to tell you all the bad stuff about Michael. Finally theirs one to tell the story of his Struggles and Accomplishments. The real Story of his life without the hate that is often based solely on The media's point of view. A great book and a must read it is informative and entertaining.
B005HGZV6U|5.0|I love Daft Punk and I love the movie. I recommend this to anyone who likes Daft Punk. It's great!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Time does not slow for anyone. Remember that we are here for a very short time. Make the most of what you have and be the best that you can.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Excellent film depicting the greatness of a man having to face difficult times with determinationa and resolve while keeping his own persoanl feelings secondary to the need of his country.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This is an awesome app and i would really like an upgrade for this app it is really cool i recommend that u use this app
B00006JL1Z|5.0|They are a style and sound unto themselves. In my age group, no matter what the preferred &#34;sound&#34;, everyone likes Fleetwood Mac.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great games to be played! LOVE THE DAILY TOURNAMENT! The freezing mostly happens on the Daily Tournament. Wish this could be remedied.
B00B23O96A|4.0|i have taken the time to digest this latest release from the legendary eric clapton.if i had written a review after a couple of listens my opinion would have short changed what has turned into a grower for me.<br />this album doesn't contain any scorchers but does have many tasteful musical moments that can be savored with repeated plays.starting with farther on down the road,the set eases in with some nice taj mahal harmonica and ends with a nice clapton solo.angel is a fine jj cale number with impeccable playing.clapton sings a few standards that were old favorites of his,the winner being all of me.a lot of the material has a reggae vibe which is great summer time listening.if pop radio played more than just phoney audio tune sounds,a song like your one and only man should be a hit.maybe the next one will feature the strat or maybe not,but i choose to enjoy a master who has given me great entertainment for 50 years.long live e.c.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I loved this movie. It did a good job of showing how the Wizard came to Oz and became the Wizard as well as showing how the Evil Witch became the way she was. And the cast was great. James Franco did a great job.
B008N1V11U|4.0|I got this for a dollar when it was on sale, and it was awesome! but sadly, the game kinda lags and even crashes sometimes. it was kinda big and my kindle couldn't really take it. so wait until the price goes down to try it. but without the bugs, I really like it!
B00CWVG1Z8|4.0|Fiction at it's best. Everyone in this girl's family have GOD-LIKE powers. Worth a watch in my opinion. Two thumbs up all the way.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Didn't enjoy the book, it had a strange plot that offended me and made it difficult to continuing reading the novel.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Well done movie. This story has an interesting take about Jack and the bean stock is petty entertaining and worth watching.
B002ZM74Y6|1.0|boring and it was too mobish. I thought the acting was bad and the story was obtuse. I didn't even finish it
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Finally a zombie movie that isn't 50% loss and 50% scarey and 0% humor. Well done movie Start to finish. Most fun zombie movie I have ever seen. Worth watching.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A challenging little game. But not so challenging that frustration sets in. If there was a story to go along with it would be a great game.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|One of the worst \\"BIG BUDGET \\" movies I've ever seen. They should be ashamed trying to \\"prequel \\", or \\"re- boot\\" a classic. Through up in my mouth twice. 1 star.
B003XDVVNQ|5.0|Ordered a size 11 W because there were no 12 W available.  Love the oyster color and Shayna Flat.  Problem is I broke my foot last week so I haven't been able to wear both shoes yet.  They are a cute style, comfortable, perfect color for summer outfits.  Wish there was a larger supply of size 12s.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|Addictive just doesn't say it. I thought that this boxed set would be nice to read over the next few weeks when I have a spare minute. I started reading and finished the next day (I finally had to have some sleep so I could see the print). From the first page I was transported into the world of the Parasol Protectorate and absolutely NEEDED to see how the seemingly insurmountable challenges presented to these fascinating characters could be resolved within the confines of polite society, and still have time for tea. From the pragmatic Alexia using a hair pin to do in the RUDE vampire, to the irascible Lord McCann, werewolf agent for Queen Victoria, to the gossipy Ivy of the horrendous taste in hats. Ms. Carriger creates an atmosphere of such intrigue and suspense, and instills in the reader a vested interest in the outcome. The twists, turns, surprises and happily resolved crises (most are definitely NOT predictable) make for a most thrilling adventure. I loved the set and am now looking around for other works by the same author.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This movie has always been one of my favorites.  The acting is great - Ally Sheedy should have received the Oscar for her portrayal.
B0077EBWVI|3.0|I was not impressed with this movie.  It was crude and the language was foul.  Instead of simply updating this movie and making the music and dancing fresh, they just made yet another dirty teen movie.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|This book is an absolute &#34;must read&#34;. Laughed from beginning to end, and just couldn't put it down. Very well written first novel.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I loved the connection with the original Wizard of Oz. Very entertaining, great special effects, good for the whole family.
0738737909|4.0|I received my deck and was pleased with the cards. Of course, being me, my copy had a strip of the gold edging missing, and I was upset at first. Then I thought about it, and took it as a sign that nothing is perfect, that to strive for perfection in life means you are missing out on some interesting things along the way. I have yet to use this deck for a reading. I'm just taking my time, getting to know the cards, suit by suit. I can tell that this deck will be extremely helpful to use for both professional and private consultation.
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone else, so I am not going to give any specifics.  The film moves at a very odd pace -- sometimes it just drags on and you almost lose interest and then it zips through important plot points.  Oz, at most times, is an unlikeable character that was hard to root for and most of the relationships between the characters felt forced and uncomfortable.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Love the game. Play it everyday!! I wish it was easier to breed some of the dragons. I can breed a pair and not get what I want then try again with 2 different dragons and still come up with the same dragon. It gets REALLY. Frustrating. That's my only complaint.
0345533054|5.0|Gone For Good is the first Harlan Coben book I have read. I just finished it & went on to Tell No One & I am about 1/4 through. This guy is a very good writer. I know that the two stories are very much a like however the writing is good enough that I want to know what happens to these people.  There aren't many writers that can do that, Stephen King of course, & do it consistently. I want to know more about the characters than the landscape or the size/type of gun used. Mr. Coben is excellent at making his characters alive & interesting. So, a new favorite - that is great. I love getting started on someone new. Sometimes it takes quite a while to find an author like this.  I just read this book for the second time because when I read it before things were going on & I didn't get to concentrate on it as much as I usually do when reading. It just got me through a rough time when I needed some down time.  Very little was remembered although I reviewed before saying that I liked the book a lot.  Now I can tell you that I REALLY liked it - this time more than the first time.  It was almost a new unread  book for me.  You won't be sorry if you decide to try this one.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Very good soundboard headphones,very good sound quality good clear sound comparable to headphones costing twice as much buy them at this price
B00D41H2PS|4.0|After going through all the steps to find out what went wrong and for the ending just to tell you what went wrong was wrong!!!!
1781162646|5.0|Joyland met all my expectations! I usually  order  my books on my e-reader but I am glad I had to hold the actual Paperback.  Just like the old days when we carried those big heavy Stephen King books and told everyone we knew about the story and sometimes lent the book to a friend.  As in all King's books, the characters are so believable and I will remember them and talk about them.  The book took me back to the carnivals and State Fairs in the Midwest. And the story was thrilling, mysterious and poiniant.  Then, I turned around and read Under the Dome on my Kindle...And swooned.  I am happy to have Mr. King living right up the road in Sarasota.!
B009E9R1IM|5.0|Fantastic album, one of the best, after all this years remains relevent and powerfull. I'm recommand to purchase it, it's worth it
B000002GVO|5.0|I love everything that the Eagles did while Don Felder still payed guitar!  He wrote Hotel California all the music and Henley Frey did the lyrics.  This is a must have if your an Eagles fan.  Today. They are not the same missing &#34;Fingers&#34; Felder.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I like Nicholas Sparks books. I got this because the movie was out and I like to read the book before I see the movie. GREAT love story
B000FCKBCU|5.0|I enjoy her books so much and this one didn't disappoint. You know it's going to have a happy ending and everything will work out exactly the way you want it to, but it is still just a joy to read.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I use this app all the time for things. It is easy to use and have not had any problems with it so far
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|Love the entire CD, this guy is really talented. All the songs are good on the entire CD. Would definitely buy again.
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I did not like this one so deleted it off my kindle and got the one that had better reviews.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|everything was so hard u have to challenge ur mind its great for rainy days and its great game for kids
B004UID2LC|1.0|THIS APP is a virus and I repeat do not get it unless you want a hacker hacking on your data.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this book!  Very fun!  Read it with my kids and their friends!  It was like eating a box of chocolates!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I think that everything is good but you should get more gold from enemies and multiplayer doesn't work. I would rate 4.5 but I can't.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Having seen the movie first, I was pleased they followed this story line so well. Looking forward to rad the rest of the series.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I liked this season very much, but did not liked the ending, and yes I would recommend it to a friend.
B008518MOW|3.0|VERY GOOD FULL ON ACTION MOVIE. HOWEVER THE 3D ACTION TODAY IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE 3D OF THE 50'S. IF YOU COMPARE IT WITH DIAL M FOR MURDER IN 3D YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE. NOTHING COMES OUT OF THE SCREEN AT YOU. THE OLD DUAL CAMERA SYSTEM IS FAR SUPERIOR. ALL FOREGROUND, CENTRE AND REAR ARE IN FOCUS IN THE OLD SYSTEM. i CAN'T WAIT TO SEE  HOUSE OF WAX IN 3D.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Got this for airplane trips where I needed to get the volume up a little without overdriving the amp on my phone and be able to get over the jet engine noise.  Came with two 1/8&#34; - 1/8&#34; cords, two clips and the charging cord (you'll need your own powered USB jack but they're everywhere).<br /><br />Mission accomplished with the last two flights I was on.  Apparently there are some counterfeit articles out there but I ordered from one of the authorized resellers and it works great.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|It is really boring and too hard for 5 year olds Addison my sister has a hard time playing it
B00BESM14U|3.0|not the funniest coming of age film but if you have the time it probably will not disappoint. just not sure why we need another of these.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I found this book inspiring and hard to put down.  To me it is about the resilience of the human spirit in the face of crushing brutality.  It is about dreams that never die and the spirit that is summoned in the belief that the good in our selves will be day win the day and make life better for many.
B00DF0POXA|4.0|I actually give this album 3.5. 2 tracks I don't like and a 3rd I'm feeling is growing on me. People can say what they want about Ye going left but when so much of the field is only going right you have no choice to stand-out. Once again he has pushed the envelope on true production, not that formula repetition we are so use to hearing in the Hip-Hop genre. I call this new era because a genius always looks the craziest right before everyone else follows suit.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|We purchased the DVD Downton Abbey Season 3.  It is a wonderful addition to our library DVD collection for our library.
1455502758|4.0|I was heading into some brain surgeries and read a review of this book and decided to buy it.  As I read it, a Jewish friend started to share things with me that made me feel like it was perhaps in my spiritual best interest not to finish this book for now.  I feel a lot of the things Hitchens says in the pages I DID read and it's gotten enough good/great reviews that it's a good purchase to make.  I will return to it sometime.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It followed the first two seasons perfectly. A little sad, but it was in keeping with the story line. Excellent!
B002FGU40S|1.0|My first pair lasted many years. I have had this pair just over a year and the soles are coming apart. I guess I need to find another brand now.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Wow - I really enjoyed this book. Orson Scott Card has a nice style of writing with good flow. I immediately purchased Speaker for the Dead and enjoyed it as well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible now I can read and learn from it on my inclement fire that I use for everything.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I did enjoy this novel. Naturally, some parts were just unbelievable; however, I still enjoyed the entertainment of it. I will read Baldacci again.
B0096DZKZC|2.0|It's a good game, sidescrolling Sonic just how we like it. And with the added homing ability from the 3D games, it's a bit cheap, but adds new platforming possibilities. The stages are well done and the music is brilliant.<br /><br />However, the touch controls are a pain and reason enough to get the game on a console or PC instead, remember that this is Sonic the Hedgehog, a fast paced platformer and not a good match for touch-inputs. I had problems keeping my thumb on the \\"thumb-stick\\" and suffered frequent lods of control.<br /><br /> The graphics are decent, but as the GNex doesn't have as powerful a graphics chip as Tegra powered ones, the visuals aren't quite as good as on those devices. But they're good enough, and certainly not bad although not in native resolution.<br /><br /> The performance however, is not up to scratch. It's slow and although playable, it doesn't feel as smooth as Sonic should and only adds to the input issues already present.
B0083Z614S|5.0|All children thrive and prosper when out in nature. Give them a garden in which to grow things and they really blossom! This book reveals in Dickensian characterisation, language and plot twists how two sickly children, who today would be dubbed autistic, are cured in three months by the miracles of communing with sun, wind, stars, plants and animals. Their mentors are a boy and an old gardener who have long lived outdoors and therefore have the experience to decode Nature for them.<br />It's a turbulent ride with the classic stereotypes of an orphan, a distant father, hearty, wise and kindly peasants, the maid torn between duty and love and a robin redbreast as intermediary and seraph to lead us to the secret garden. A great read for adults and kids eight and over.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|The STG 44 is what tempted me to get it. It's fun to play with and the cats always run when I use it. Being a WW2 firearms simulator where is the .45 and mg 42? if they were included I would have given it 5 stars.
B001AW156U|1.0|Guess the old saying is true; you get what you pay for. In this case, I didn't even get the ones pictured in the description above. Like the customer below me, I spent 30 minutes or so trying to get the things on and looked up tutorial videos when I finally realized mine were different. Needless to say, they've been trashed now. The only reason I got these were because they were cheap but I guess I'll just shell out the $8 for the ones at Gamestop.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|Good follow up to a great first book.  Cannot wait for the final installment! I Couldn't put it down.  Well done Patrick Rothfuss
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I wish it continued it is very emotional and I had to keep from crying I will recommend this book to everyone I know
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice game, makes you think. Good for us old people to keep our minds active. I may even make it to the tenth floor:-)
B00AO686MY|5.0|This Blu-ray version has superb quality (and sound for its age).  Better than when I sw it in the theater 25 years ago.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Yes, there were story lines not even touched on, but with the expansive plot I'm not surprised.  I was thoroughly absorbed as with the previous books and sad when the end came (too soon as usual with a good story).  As time goes on I find myself becoming more and more intrigued with this story and very curious as to how it will resolve itself!
B00CWV8X04|3.0|This movie starts out like one of those movies that is shown on the Life Channel (chick flick).  So I was kind of ho hum about it until the plot twisted and turned,  So I kind of liked it for that.  Check it out for that if nothing else.
B009K86D86|5.0|Take the time to watch it - it's not always pleasant, in fact parts of it are truly disturbing and quite sad.<br /><br />The documentary seeks to trace where the food in the grocery stores in America comes from (there's little to no representation of food internationally - except when food production in USA impacts the world.).<br /><br />After setting out with this goal, it locks onto the key ingredients in the food (and what appears to be variety), and how they are produced - thus farms are shown (and therefore corn and soybean production - from seed to harvest), and meat production (beef, chicken, pork - from growth to slaughter).<br /><br />From there it shows you how these parts have evolved into businesses and thus - the title: Food, Inc.  The point of the movie, without really ruining it for you, is that this isn't always a good thing.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love all these apps!! Like playing dress-up with dolls from my childhood - very relaxing. With this app, everything is so pretty; and few things are left out. I do wish there were more backgrounds for final pics - maybe I am just missing them. Anyway - nice, simple, very lush and pretty app. Thanks, Devs!!!!!!
B007XNAQL0|5.0|One of the most memorable concert events I've ever attended. The original video -- then DVD -- was a cherished part of my collection. This Blu-ray remaster is a gift for any PG fan1
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Too many animated movies are lazily written, and may hold a chilld's interest for a brief time but be tediously painful for an adult to watch.  Not this one.  This is cleverly written, hysterically funny, and entertaining for kids and adults alike.  I have loved the commercials for the sequel, and decided to rent this.  After watching the rental, I immediately bought it for my video library.  I want a minion for my very own.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good game.  Made u really think but was too short.  Not enough levels.  Finished it in one day. Mini games were good.  Had to skip a couple as I could not figurre out. Has hint button so u didn get stuck and frustrated.
1490313370|5.0|Since starting my company in 2005 there are times when I wanted to give up and go back on the hamster wheel. I stayed the course and continue to do what I love in a these trying times that we live in. Reading this book has given me a new perspective, inspiration and a road map to make meaningful changes in my life. The world has changed and those that are willing to choose themselves will thrive and achieve true happiness. Today I wrote the down my daily practice and I will apply it to my life. Thanks James!
B00BZW5W3W|4.0|I've heard most of Maysa releases and this one it good, but not as great as some of the earlier CD's.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game to help pass the time and work your brain.  Trying to put the pieces together can be challenging.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|I had always heard of the movie but had never watched it until now. I think everyone should see it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun to play on the road and is Kinda challenging. I like the sushi one. I definently would reccomend.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I LOVED J.K. Rowling's work in the Harry Potter series and was very excited to get her newest work. I believe she is a brilliant writer, and could see her style (which I love) in the 20 pages I read - however what I couldn't get past was the language. The over use of the F bomb and other such language plagued the dialog so badly that I just couldn't read it. I am sorely disappointed and believe that Jo is a much more brilliant writer than this garbage shows.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My grandson watches it over and over! Now I love it too! We both know all the words to the songs.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The game definitely requires more time and attention than little children (3 -4) can muster, but the gameplay is excellent regardless. My 3 year-old loves the game and the characters stay true to the show...<br /><br />The Downfall is the money parents need to invest for their kids to seriously progress. It's honestly ridiculous!<br /><br />I suggest the game if you have the patience to save and increase slowly.  5 stars all the way. I help my little one, but keep days in between her play time. So I can save money to expand and buy shops to make progress in the game.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Poignant portrayal of the challenges of family and &#34;mental illness&#34; of varying degrees in several of the characters. Very true to life as to what goes on in many families - the emotional dynamics, superstitions, cultural programming that affects human perception and behaviors. Loved the gut level honesty of it. And, of course, the happy ending.
0345803485|3.0|Despite being a best seller, this book polarises audiences into a love hate faction, hence my modest review rating representing a global audience. The book has a tendency to  induce a love or hate relationship with the book.<br /><br />FSOG is palatable, easy to read, and a compelling erotica novel. It produces the essential raw hot sex scenes in torrents throughout the book. Upon first read it's empowering and confronting with it sexy romance scenes. Practically every other page either leads into or describes such a scene between the main characters.  Threaded in between these scenes lie the unconventional love storyline between Anastasia and Christian grey which an idealistic fantasy world that many dream of, but few are capable of dreaming off.<br /><br />Perhaps it's this stretch of fantasy that may antagonise the critics? It's easy to see the transparency in plot and fallible absence of substance: Gusto, bravado, and that `good-vibration' that all well-read consumers are so eagerly seeking within the pages of a \\"Masterpiece\\" book.<br /><br />Set your expectations well before considering. It is a great book to read at a leisurely pace, but it also provides you with the opportunity to whizz through it at dizzying speeds within a couple of days.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I love this book. I have read so many fantasy books, and this one is truly at the top of my list. The characters are intriguing, the story flows with twists and turns, like a river. I couldn't put it down. My only complaint is that the third book is not out yet. I am depressed beyond words. I have been drawn into Kvothe's story, I NEED to know what happens! Wonderful story, I highly recommend it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The show is fabulously written having characters who are funny and quick-witted. We can't watch just one episode at a time.  Very entertaining! It's my husband's favorite show.
1592537251|5.0|What a wonderful book.  In my opinion every artist should think of buying this book.  Is full of information.  Arrived super fast, in excellent conditions.  All I can say is, maybe you should get your copy fast!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|By this time you love all the characters, even the nerdy Louis whose weirdness makes one laugh.  I hope this show lasts for many many seasons.  It's that good!
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|yes, i really like this album, i have not stopped listening to it really, yes i like it, it is not the poet or home is where the heart is or the last soul man, but it is still a great album and the title song is his favourite so i will not disagree, thank you bobby womack for all the great music over the years.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't wait to get to the second book and am almost finished with the third.  Wonderful series. I would recommend it to anyone.
B00797MB0O|3.0|SPOILER. In one of the very last scenes, Patton Oswalt's character's sister talks to Mavis and gives her exactly the wrong message. Mavis had hit rock bottom and admitted wholeheartedly that she wanted change, but the sister responds with \\"No you're great, so much better than these people in this little town.\\"  That was the blackest of the comedy, and it ends the movie.<br /><br />So why'd they tell this story? To force me to rewrite that scene at the kitchen table with our antihero and the sister?<br /><br />If it weren't so well done, I'd have pressed the \\"Unwatch\\" button and cleansed my soul of it. And I adore Theron and Oswalt.<br /><br />Teetering on the brink of soul-crushing. Not quite funny enough to make up for the bleakness. Not one I'd recommend because there is no \\"Unwatch\\" button on your soul's remove control [pro tip: watch this one with a rohypnol at the ready -- it's as close as you'll get].<br /><br />Yet something here is human and beautiful. And boy I really like Oswalt in films and on stage.
B0012GTZC0|1.0|I have to admit, I didn't finish this book. I TRIED so hard. I got about 40% through with it and just couldn't make myself read it anymore. For me, there was no suspense and the main character was rather dull. I don't doubt what others say that this book might have been very interesting or shocking at its end but I don't read to try to \\"get through\\" the book that I'm on and so with regret I set the book down. I don't do that very often at all but this just could not keep my interest.
0345472322|4.0|It has great insights and the format is easy to read. I found some things irrelevant, but not too many
B005LAIHGI|4.0|As I said above, this movie was aladeen!  The jokes were very aladeen and the acting was a little aladeen par.  I found Sacha Baron Cohen's performance, as that of Ben Kingsley and all the other stars that are just scattered all over the film to be extremely aladeen.  It shows that Cohen knows a lot of other comedians and just put them in the aladeen places.  Script was aladeen, but we all know that the plots to Cohen's movies are somewhat aladeen and to be taken with a grain of salt.<br />I haven't laughed that hard in a while.  Worth it.<br /><br />And yes, you need to see the movie to get the \\"aladeen\\" joke.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I had never heard of this show but a young lady was enthralled by it (she even had a special cake made up with a &#34;red telephone booth&#34; on top). I had no idea what this was all about but she mentioned it was from a show called Doctor Who (who?). I went to it on my Kindle Fire and have been watching various episodes ever since and it is rather fascinating. How the British cram so much into a segment is amazing. I have found out that this &#34;telephone booth&#34; is actually an intergalactic time-traveling whatcha-macallit. Leave it to the British to take something mundane and turn it into something exotic. I have watched maybe 8-9 shows and I guess it has got me hooked. It is sometimes rather corny but one goes along with it. It is not as exotic as U.S. scifi flicks but that is okay.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The Game is so cute. My 3 kids love playing this game. It's easy for them to play and keeps them entertained. I would definitely recommend this App.
B00CCEHR80|5.0|A great cd but who wouldn't love Garcia??  The live cd is the best way to enjoy his music.  Bought several same time..  ENJOY
1932735410|5.0|this is a fantastic prep book.  if it weren't for this book, i don't know how i would have passed the exam.  however, if you take the exam before july 31, 2013, you can still use the 6th edition.  i had both editions, and there were such small updates to the 7th edition, that i could have easily used the 6th edition.  and yes, rita's process map tracks to the PMBOK's 4th edition knowledge areas chart!  rita just provides more information to make the process easier to understand.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Not a bad buy at$1.99. Some of the levels are pretty tough and can be frustrating if you are playing the timed version.
B008Y73940|4.0|Not at all what I expected, it was even better. Great way to spend a rainy afternoon. Love the ending.
0307352153|5.0|This is an amazing and empowering read whether you are an introvert, ambivert, or extrovert. I'm an introvert and it was nice to read that there are physiological reasons for it and that it isn't *gasp* a horrendous defect. It also helps to know that there are workarounds for some of the everyday things I struggle with and that it is nice to have, I guess, permission to take the time and recharge my batteries in solitude.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I read to the end of this because I wanted to find out what happened (and I had bought it instead of borrowing it from the library) and I was glad for a satisfying ending - but what hard work in the meantime!

B004LPLU4K|4.0|As a review I read stated - sweet with a happy ending.  The theme of a girl that has a hard life but helps another overcome a disability in spite of caring people who want to keep the patient, as it turns out, from rehab.  It has a happy ending.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and the characters!  Can't wait for season four.  I am glad that Amazon carries this, and it was so convenient to watch right on my PC.
034580404X|5.0|E.L. James is extraordinary in her pursuit of tying in each in every character. She always leave the reader wanting more.....
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book is amazing. And i Loved how it kept my interest the entire time. Always something new was happening.
B003XCVQ3C|2.0|Don't buy this adapter. It lasted less than a year. While it worked fine at first, it stopped working at all after minimal use.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My wife and I both have this game, it's fun to try and out level each other! Great time killer as well!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|there is a challenge to this game. you have to solve puzzles and place items in order. if you really paid attention all yours answers are there for you. eyes and mind open for clues. I enjoy solving each area and have gotten stuck. think think think
B0058YPL66|5.0|LOVE IT !!! i got it on time , its used DvD but its looked so new to me , and very good condition !! :) , and I am looking forward to get the second season :)
B009GEYX5E|5.0|My 15 year old son found these polaroids at a traders fair for $1.  He wanted to see how this worked and we found this film on Amazon.  Since we were taking a risk - we wanted to find the cheapest one possible.  He had a lot of fun with this.  If the film was cheaper, we would definitely buy more for playing.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|great and inspiring movie for children and parents alike. I was not too crazy about the magic parts but still a fun movie. Our daughters (7 and 9) want to watch it over and over
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I am pleased with product. I liked the many features and ease of operation. I would recommend this product to anyone.
B003SI7SRE|3.0|It's not going to win any awards, but this movie will entertain you.  I started watching it, but then had to do something so I was able to pick up the next day at the same place.  I liked being able to rent this movie from Amazon.
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Super movie. Did not get to finish it, but will absolutely watch it again. Not a real stretch of the imagination, considering the state our country is in today.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I liked the story being set during WW2.  I hope the sequel resolves what happens to Captain's love interest.  This is director Joe Johnston's best movie by far.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Probably the best surf movie I have ever seen. North Shore was my favorite until this movie. And, based on a true story, wow! Don' t miss this one.
0517543052|5.0|Ram Dass is so brilliant. So inspired. So connected. This beautiful man has given such a great gift to the world with his work and presence.
B0033VUH6A|4.0|This movie takes you into the nitty-gritty of what our soldiers had to endure. Kept me anxious and on the edge of my seat, wondering if an explosion would change a character's life or end it entirely.  This movie serves to remind us of how expendable we are when we put ourselves in harms way.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|My favorite past time is reading.  And, although I love great literature,  I prefer stories that can just take me away from my hectic life for a little while.  I look for books with characters I can fall in love with.  So with that said, Entwined with You is my favorite of the Crossfire series.  This book (and the entire series) is great to get lost in.  I love the characters and couldn't wait for this book to come out to see what lied in store for Gideon and Eva.  Sylvia Day did not disappoint!
B008NMT684|5.0|My son is two and completed all the puzzles in a hour. We didn't even know he could do puzzles! He has been playing it everyday since we bought it. Lots of trucks cars and construction equipment and every time you finish a puzzle you get to pop balloons.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Excellent serie, now im going for the second season.<br />Good performance and excellent history, it doesn't matter if it doesn't match with the real life
B00CL6HGIK|3.0|I was hoping for more.  Mark and Russell were well-cast in their roles but the movie was underwritten.  Wait to see it for free.
B00BJUQP4A|5.0|Because I have  \\"Maddie On Things\\" on my Kindle(ipad)I have this wonderful book with me at all times. I have pulled it out on numerous occasions when children have been a little restless.I open it up on my Kindle and let them look through all the pictures of Maddie.The parents are extremely grateful.<br />I recently had my car serviced and was passing \\"Maddie\\" around to everyone in the dealership waiting room. It sure made the time fly and we were mostly disappointed when our name was called to tell us a car was ready.🐾
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|I love this cd! It's eclectic and genuine and passionate and a go to! When I'm unsure what I want to listen to, I channel ORANGE for some great music! Love it!
B00C061I3K|5.0|awesome daft punk album, one of my favorite artists ever. I hope everyone can enjoy it as much as I did.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I bought this for my mom after she watched it at someone's house and wouldn't stop raving about it! She keeps it on constantly! Def a great buy!!
B000059MEL|5.0|beautiful vinyl, love daft punk. The pictures inside are amazing , I haven't listen to it because I don't have a recorder but I just ordered one
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|This cd was one of the best comeback cd's in a long time! I know he hadn't actually left music, but, since his fans hadn't heard from him musically in years, it felt like it. So glad this was what he chose to come back with. Mirrors is ah-mazing! But, I seriously love every song!!!
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|A little tedious with the romance. More mystery, fantasy less romance. It felt rather repetitive and that just lends itself to sappy.
1439181780|5.0|This book is a must have and one to live by.  I truly love this book and if you really want to change your life read it again and again until you understand it.  It is such a simple concept but one to master for life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an Awesome app. I also wish Amazon got Roblox which is an Awesome app which I think is just as epic as Minecraft.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Great movie. Surpassed my expectations. Bruce Willis will always be one of my all time favorites. The entire cast had amazing chemistry and really pulled off this movie.
0425252868|5.0|This true tale of WW11 is engaging from page one. It is written in such a way that even non-aviation types will understand the technicalities of flight. In this story we see the development of two aviators, one American and one German, as they head inexorably for war. We get a clear sense of the fear carried by all pilots who enter savage skies. More importantly, we see the unquenchable spark of humanness, and one grand gesture that changes lives forever. A great read.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|This was a good flick. I think the director may have thought that the audience would miss too much so he exposed the answers to the shows &#34;mysteries&#34; to blatantly. Other than that, it was a good thriller.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best  game ever. It is way better than that boring temple run<br />I am in luv with this gsme
B00846REIS|5.0|And I couldn't put this down, so exciting almost dropped my kindle in the pool. A great summer read while on vacation.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game BUT it sucks that you have to wait for ever for the horses energy to build back up. Besides that it's a great game.
B00AKO93JK|3.0|While it's a good workout, it was confusing because of all the changes of position.  First you're standing doing squats or weights, next you're on the floor doing floor exercises, then you're standing again, then on the floor ... it got a bit annoying with all of the changes.  It would have been more enjoyable to do a few more than one floor/standing exercise at a time before switching positions.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This book kept me intrigued to find out more. It was an AP Literature assignment and I couldn't have loved it more. It is a little confusing at times, but for school, my teacher couldn't have picked a better book. The plot is different from other books and interesting. The author did a great job at writing this. He couldn't have done better. This is sure a great piece of literature.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I loved it! Especially for reading and language class and those hard book reports. It is free and on my kindle from day one! It is a good book to learn from.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|i work odd shifts so i don't get to see much of regular tv.  this was a treat! the stories are great and the characters are built up so you can get interested in and care how the story builds around them.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Easy to handle & operate, it's a very good buy. Light & sturdy ! Highly recommend this to Nikon users.
B00DGN51O8|3.0|Not very compelling story telling.  Could have been better.  No one to care much about in this story.  Better luck next time...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really love this game I really hope I get,a lot farther in this game I'm on level 25 and doing alone I'm getting farther
B0063IH60K|3.0|Does not recognize matches, and is sluggish. The ads are not that bad, and the other free games are worse.
1932100660|5.0|Although I have not completed the book, this has been one of the most enlightening and informative books on nutrition I have ever read. A must read for anyone. Thanks to my son for opening my eyes to this.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Historical significance was excellent.<br />Very good read.  Carried well through the families lives from book one.  Every emotion was included!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It's so addicting I'm at the great white shark but I just need to buy it I thought the game wasn't going to be free but it was
B006MW3UZW|3.0|Much better than Tylenol PM, but not quite as effective as Ambien. The most overhyped show I can remember watching...
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I like this app better than the other YouTube apps BECSUSE I am able to see any and all videos without being blocked.
B00C7JFIRC|3.0|This is one wonderful movie as far as the color of the film and beauty. However the acting was well lets just say bad and go on/The acting reminded me of Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.Since i didnt care for the old one or the new one that kind of summes up my feelings about it. But that being said i have to go back to the wonder of the color and how it was filmed.This would be a good film for childern. Although that old wicked witch when she gets turned on it's a little over the top. But a good film for childern..And the young of heart , perhaps. B- from me.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Takes a long long time to get any questions answered and seems to end way too soon, but overall good book!!!
B004USLWVE|4.0|I am a serious amateur photographer.  I purchased this backpack for our family vacation to Disney-world. I packed a Nikon D800 with a 20mm and a 24-120mm zoom for this trip. This backpack is big, it would barely fit under the seat in front of me on the USAir flight to Orlando. Lay the backpack on it's back and slide under the seat in front, be careful not to pack to full or it will not fit between the floor and the bottom of the seat in front. Padding and configuration is mostly standard compared to the other camera bags/backpacks I own. The sling feature works well for me.
B0047GNCSU|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by LC's book. It was very well written and kept me interested. L.A. Candy reminded me of a less scandalous Gossip Girl novel. The book was in perfect condition and shipped fast. Can't wait to read the next one!
B006TF6WAM|3.0|Although I read this book from cover to cover it was a tad pedestrian :) the quirky insertions helped to maintain my interest.
B003B2C92G|5.0|I GOT SPAWN THE MOVIE SO I DON'T WANT TO RETURN IT AND THANK YOU THE MOVIE IS VERY GOOD
B007TK77QE|4.0|I was expecting to be underwhelmed and was surprised - in a good way - not a literary read but I enjoyed the story and angles.
B00ABLJ5NQ|3.0|Not a bad book but I couldn't quite engage with the protagonist -- they were a passive agent which other elements of the plot acted upon, but never became actively engaged in their own story.<br /><br />The book was, as well, fused with a heavily autobiographical subtext. The adult was obviously Mr. Gaiman, but we never get to know the man, only the child. This was disappointing.<br /><br />On top of this, there wasn't much of a story here and little by way of dramatic tension.<br /><br />The mythos was enjoyable but spare.<br /><br />This work is heavily influenced by chick-lit and offers little by way of interest for male readers. Perhaps the bulk of his readers are female, and he is writing specifically for them? This was not the case in Neverwhere or American Gods -- both of which I enjoyed very much. Still, this is not a book for men -- unless they secretly wish to be women. But that is a whole new argument.<br /><br />In summary, this is a VERY light summer read and one that you will forget as quickly as you put it down.<br /><br />Neutral Recommendation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this book.  I was in suspense the entire read and surprised at the ending. I wifi recommend this one to friends.
0767827902|5.0|This is a classic flick from the early 70's and is still a great one today. Received this DVD in great condition and timely.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|He is a favorite author and I always enjoy his stories.  I feel like I am watching a movie while I am reading.
086571701X|4.0|This is a great practical guide, but some of the more technical areas on water chemistry and the nitrogen cycle are confusing and not written with sufficient clarity or detail.
0307895505|5.0|This is a great buy, exceptional value. It gives hours of entertainment and has three times the amount of information that Elder Scrolls 3 & 4 had with very good quality.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Nice......Now when I have spare time away from the house, I can read my book......Just gotta figure out what to do with my Paperback collection of Forgotten Realms Books now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|After playing other games like this and 1000 floors, I decided this one is the best. Fun point and click puzzles...if you like those. I would also suggest &quot;The Room&quot;
B00CWY76CC|4.0|excellent challenge; just difficult enough without frustration.  looking forward to more levels.  I recommend you try this game don't think you will be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a girl and I love it. I don't know why but when you find your first diamond that's when it gets addictive.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I didn't like Mountains Echoed as well as author's first 2 books but I did enjoy it & recommend it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I love the Game of Thrones books.  I hate waiting for the next one to come out.  Read them all!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you have the odd 10 minutes to kill and enjoy solving puzzles, this is for you. I hope more levels will be released soon.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I really hate that I have to wait for the next one to come out.  Soooo many sub-plots and character stories!  Love, love, love the books.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So sad to see this end, i don't know if i'll enjoy the movie anymore but i had to read it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I just love the Game of Thrones books.  I hate waiting for the next one to come out.  Read them!
B00CF34B2I|2.0|First, let me say I'm a huge fan and play M:TG card game often. The one thing that spoiled this game was the fact that you had to constantly sink money into it. It's free to try. If you want to unlock certain decks or get specific cards, you need to feed the app real world money.<br /><br />The idea of booster packs was very new and exciting, until they charge you $1.99 after the first 6 packs. I won't be buying extra packs, especially when I can buy physical cards that have cash value for $3.99 at almost any retailer.<br /><br />Fun game, great graffics. If you like the card game, you'll love the app. Just don't think that $9.99 will open the whole game. :-(
1781162646|5.0|I love Stephen King... not everything mind you, but this  one was great. The story was good.. characters were fully fleshed. It was quick.. just right for summer!  Yet I was left with the desire not to have it end ... to continue with these &#34;people'!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is lots of fun, I love puzzle type games and this is much more fun than 100 floors.
B001AG52AG|5.0|Great cast of actors with their animal companions travel across the world on an exciting adventure the whole family can enjoy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It asks for a rating after a brief experience but for now I like it. We shall see if after playing it for a while I still like it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I decided to read this book because so many people were talking about it and how good it was.<br /><br />Here's what I liked: It was a good mystery, and I liked the way the author wrote in the two different perspectives of both the husband and the wife. Also, I did like how the story was a commentary on our media-saturated society and the dangers of jumping to conclusions before we even have all of the information or the facts.<br /><br />What I didn't like: Although there were several twists and turns, I have to say that I did figure out one of the big plot twists -- never a good thing for an author since I am usually not one to figure these things out. In addition, I thought the ending was truly disappointing and a &#34;cop out.&#34; It didn't feel like there was a resolution that was satisfying at all.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|, Fun and graphic.I have a broken hand and can't type but trust me...it is awesome.  You will love it.  Thrilling.
B009C7JS14|1.0|canceled it, because it had ads i canceled it and got the updated version, much happier because of it, thank you:)
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Never been a big animated fan but was intrigued by this two part story. Both films were fun and nice to look at for an animated beginner.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|i like this one better than the other, no ads and i can get the weather about any town or state I want.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|Very Good movie. Matt Damon and Danny DeVito are very good actors. It make me want to read the book.
B00448SE4S|1.0|Clearly, only stoners would appreciate the bright colors and dialog.  This movie was absolutely horrible.  Michael Cera has done better.
B004DF3S7A|5.0|Bought this for my mother-in law & she absolutely loved it.<br />Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys Rod Stewart
B001QFZADA|4.0|Like the love profile at the end. Showed clear examples of the 5 love languages even if one does not take the love profile test. Taught ways how to identify ones primary love languages.
B000FC130E|5.0|In that special Neil Gaiman way. Took me away and then left me back on my own doorstep, all day-dreamy.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|It is a little slow at first but it start to go faster the farther you get into the game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was given to me as a gift by a friend because she had already read the book and loved it.  This is more geared towards young adult readers which the both of us certainly are not but I enjoyed the book book as well.  The book does touch on a sensitive subject but is done so very tastefully that I don't think it would be offensive to anybody.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Like his two previous books And the Mountains Echoed was masterfully written and beautifully told. I did not want it to end!
B007N8RULO|5.0|One of the very best games on the web.  Try it one or twice and lovers of solitaire are certain to enjoy it.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Loved watching this the second time around also. Spur of the moment rental with the folks and a good time was had by all.
B00004RF9G|5.0|If you like musicals, ballet, Scottish Accents and love stories,  this one has it all!  A wonderful tale of a village that only lives one day every hundred years and the man who accidently stumbles upon it and falls in love with one of  the villagers.  He then has to decide whether or not he leaves or stays.  A wonderful movie!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie wasn't the CGI acid trip I thought it was going to be. Great cast. Mila Kunis stole the show. James Franco can do no wrong.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It's is very fun and challenging, but  at same time not hard. Each level does get hard.  It is very fun!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It was great to finally get this and it did not dissapoint. I read it quickly and now have to wait for the next. Can not wait....How long?
1582701709|1.0|This whole idea is nothing but a scam that is being perpetrated by con artists to fool the ignorant and weak minded! The presenters in the TV show of the same name are crooks and fakes.  Some claim to be Philosophers, Metaphysicians, and Visionaries but those are not even real jobs! If you look up their bios on Wikipedia several are known con artists. James Arthur Ray is a convicted murderer who let several people die in Arizona! They didn't get wealthy by the power of positive thinking but by selling books, videos and seminar tickets to suckers!  While there is a lot to be said for being positive, the whole idea that if you believe something it will come true is rediculous!  That implies that you would need to have psychic super powers in order to influence your surroundings to make what you want come true but nobody has that kind of super powers!
B00B7Y0206|2.0|It doesn't work after you buy the download for it. It keeps saying it is loading but never plays avideo. Needs to be fixed.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|I couldn't imagine diving without this filter after seeing both my video with it and a buddy's without.  Improves color and as a result clarity with distinguishing objects more prominently underwater.  Most definitely a must have for anyone using their gopro to dive.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this site; it allows you to easily brows, set up multiple boards, and pin lots of pictures.  Fun and addicting.
B009PK9SB8|3.0|This is a great addition which allows you to see what you are filming and taking a picture of.  If you do not mount your camera, it does improve your videos, however the touch screen is not the greatest.  There are spots which do not seem to work as well and it is sometimes difficult to get sort through the photos because of this.  However, simply for seeing what you are filming, it serves its purpose.
1449410243|5.0|I got this for my son for Christmas and he loved it.  I pretty sure he read it aloud to his two cats.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's a fun game that's like temple run, but I like this game better than temple run. Although it can get boring after a while.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|A great pairing of musical souls and talent for sharing feelings through song.  You'll find yourself listening again and again.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Works like a charm.  I really can't sing it's praises anymore other than I like it. I'll never review another product.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I love this show. Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen are both so great. The little quirks and obsessions that each of their characters have are well acted and portrayed. Hannibal is actually likeable even while he is manipulating and murdering. This shows keeps you completely on you the edge of your seat. I would recommend this show to everyone that can stomach the bloodiness of it all.
B002H3T3TM|4.0|Very good blu-ray with a lot of extras. Michael Buble show how works his relationship with family e musicians at Madison Square Garden.
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and would recommend if you like the Twilight movies.  Well written, good story line with mystery and romance.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|I really wanted the night sky.  However, It wouldn't work on my Kindle Fire HD.  I don't have any other things that it will work on.  So when I called Amazon about they said i should get  rig of it and returned my purchase funds.  Amazon is the greatest and the only ones that I trust for online buying.  Lulu
193700788X|4.0|Even though the last several books in the Sookie Stackhouse series lacked ,...something, I thoroughly enjoyed the series and at some point will re-read them all.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is fun and doesn't limit you to anything overall a great game I really enjoy the g r graphics
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|In a time where a lot of pop/r&b music sounds the same, Justin Timberlake came back with a bang. This album has a neo-soul/pop and r&b sound to it. It is unlike anything I have heard. You can sit and let the funk/soul move you, dance by yourself or with a loved one, or just groove to it while doing some work or in a car. Excellent album at an amazing price. I most definitely recommend this album for music lovers!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Pretty awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Would recommend to anyone looking for a mystery solving game. Keeps you thinking and the whole family enjoys it.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|Have heard of this band before but never listened to them until I bought this. Another great buy for a great price! If you like indie/rock/alternative, I would highly recommend this album!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Worth the money to get the full game. Keeps pace going and interest up and graphics are good. Won't regret spending the small amount.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The entire story was lacking plot and suspense. The story progressed much like anyone's ordinary life with ordinary problems, not with the prestige and glamour one might fantasize that would accompany a relationship with an extremely attractive billionaire. The series already started to decline with the second book, but this was the last straw. I have no desire to feed the minuscule amount of curiosity created from the first book or waste any more money. Wait for the price to go down because the content isn't worth the $9.99 that my impatience was sacrificed for.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This series is so addictive! I'm just blowing through these episodes. Such a well written, well acted show.<br />Once I finish I will be starting them over! Going to watch tonight!!
1932735410|5.0|I found the book to be very helpful in explaining some of the Project Management concepts.  Practice tests are to the point and worded similarly to the real tests.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Truly impossible, but a true story about one family that was hit by a Tsunami in Asia during there Christmas vacation.  Just an amazing story about this family and all of their struggles during this major event.  Well written, cast, and acted.  Something that changed their life for every and will never be forgotten!
B00D2K40WY|3.0|I love to pick out the outfits doing the makeup.But hardly any of the outfits r unlocked or makeup.So there's only a couple.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book lived up to the hype and its place on the Best seller list for so long.It moves along at a brisk pace as it examines the minds  and motives of the main characters. Just as soon as you think you've cracked the case, you haven't! gripping all the way to the end.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|It does have beautiful graphic and good information.  I travel a lot and it help decide what to wear for work.<br />Helpful when it works
0061142026|5.0|\\"Adventures are all very well in their place, but there's a lot to be said for regular meals and freedom from pain.\\"<br /><br />I'm going to forgo my usual plot summary, as the blurb does a good job describing the contents of the book and I don't think my blathering for a couple of lines could be more insightful as to what HAPPENS in this book.<br /><br />My first experience with \\"Stardust\\" and, incidentally, Neil Gaiman, was when a dear friend of mine lent me the movie \\"Stardust\\". You know, the one that did \\"Meh\\" at the theaters and seemed to fade into the background (or at least, that was MY perception of it). Anyway, I was like, \\"Oh, boy, here's a movie I'm probably going to hate.\\" (Optimistic me, eh?) I put off watching the movie for a loooong time, until finally, I was tired of being a horrible friend and watched it so I could return it.<br /><br />I was HUGELY surprised at how GOOD the movie was. It was charming, funny, intelligent, clever and FUN. The characters were great, acting superb, and scenes well done. I adored Tristan (note the name was changed in the film from TristRan to Tristan minus \\"R\\", which I think was a good idea based on how difficult it would have been to say Tristran the entire movie), Yvaine, and Captain Shakespeare. I enjoyed myself immensely and kicked myself heartily for not watching it sooner. I made a note to one day pick up some Gaiman books and check them out.<br /><br />Years passed. A friend of mine invited me to attend a Neil Gaiman book signing with her. I said, \\"Sure, why not!\\" It didn't matter in my mind that I hadn't ever read a book by him or that the only acquaintance I had with his work was a movie that didn't do all that great in the theater. That was just the impetus I needed to finally read a Neil Gaiman book, the book on which the movie \\"Stardust\\" is based.<br /><br />\\"Stardust\\" the book is just as much fun as \\"Stardust\\" the movie, albeit in a different way (particularly the ending and the sad omission of Captain Shakespeare and his crew). It's smart and funny; it pokes fun at fantasy and fairy tale cliches all the while reveling in them. It's got great characters, great lines, beautiful writing, and gorgeous world-building.<br /><br />The characters you come to expect in this novel are present here, but Gaiman refuses to just create an archetype and plug them into their stereotypical role. Tristran may be the \\"hero\\", but he really doesn't need to save the world from anything. Yvaine may be the \\"damsel in distress\\", but if she needs \\"rescuing from someone\\", it would be the hero! Victoria, the \\"Love Interest\\", has quite the astonishing storyline - she starts out the novel rather cold and heartless, but by the end, I really felt for her and was astonished at the clever twist Gaiman took her story. As for the other key characters - the scarlet witch, Primus, Septimus, and Semele - well, they were constantly throwing me for a loop.<br /><br />But that is just par for the course in this book. This book isn't like the movie, where there is a big \\"showdown\\". There is no big fight with the scarlet witch. There are lots of deaths, but not the ones you expect. Bad guys don't get their Disney deaths; the good guys don't all end up in palaces ruling in peace and harmony, with their loved ones forever and ever. In fact, the Epilogue is quite bittersweet.<br /><br />This isn't to say the novel is perfect. There were times that I felt really great stories were brushed over to get to the end of Tristran's voyage. Particularly episodes on Captain Alberic's ship were skimmed over; we hear how those were some of the best of Tristran's stay in Faerie but see painfully little. Something similar happens in the last third of their journey - adventures are mentioned in passing but never seen. Why say that it would take 6 months (or so) to get where the star is when you are going to spend so little of the book on these adventures? I don't need to see everything, but given the pace earlier in the book, it seems odd.<br /><br />But when the biggest (only?) complaint you have is you want to see MORE in this world, are you really doing badly? I think not - I'd rather read a book that makes me want more, that I enjoyed wholeheartedly, than a book that showed me everything I wanted (and more) that bored me to tears.<br /><br />Gaiman is truly a master storyteller and a beautiful wordsmith. \\"Stardust\\" may be the first of his works I've read, but it most certainly won't be the last.<br /><br />Brought to you by:<br />*C.S. Light*t seems odd.<br /><br />But when the biggest (only?) complaint you have is you want to see MORE in this world, are you really doing badly?

B00BESJYAY|5.0|I was movies by the story. Especially the youngman's relationship with his mentor. I highly recomend this movie to any fathers out there with teenage children.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use, infinitely customizable. Love the alarm sounds, let alone the music option. I'm very happy with this app!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Captivating book that is impossible to put down. Where most books reach a dull point, this one never did. It always left you wanting to read more. There were twists and turns that always kept the reader on his/her toes.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I enjoy his type of smooth singing and of course I like his voice, but he is the go to CD when I am stressed out and need something to relax me, while this might not be what the younger people need I am glad there is still music around for us 70 year olds.
B00621ENT0|1.0|the first two seasons make the show what it is, after that Lost just seems to become drawn out, idk.
1476719071|1.0|When I started buying books from Amazon with one click on my IPad, I started reading almost one book every other day. I also started reading books based on the reader's reviews. Over the past year, I have learned that there is a trend going on and a big chunk of teen books have the same theme: Bad boy/ musician boy  and a good girl or broken  girls/boys. Similar stories over and over..<br /><br />I belive that when we read, we learn something even from books written just for pleasure. However, we should be very careful with the message that we deliver to people, especially to teen population. I am a physician; however, I spend most of my clinic time talking with teen girls and telling them not to have sex because their friends are doing it, because it is okay. I beg them to finish school get a profession and be able to stand on their own feet. When I read the first pages of this book I was shocked. This cute , good girl watches a fight in which guys are beaten to a bloody pulp and our good girl does not even flinch when her cardigan is covered with blood. Second, I do not like the language.. saying F word is not cool and should not be the part of a routine conversation. In addition, this virgin good girl starts sleeping with a guy in the same bed for a month because of a stupid bid. Come on...how real is this..how normal is this?....Sorry I did not learn anything from this book but nonsense..<br /><br />I hated this book, I could not finish it.. I read fifty shades and similar books because they were written for certain purpose.  Although writers are free to write everything and this is what it should be, I suggest that they be careful about the message that they deliver to the society. Majority of our health care money goes to teen pregnancies, preterm deliveries and their treatment...
0316226424|5.0|This is the best book I could have read!Reality mixed with fiction=Young adults are now into reading.People who hate this book just don't pay attention descriptions.Read the story again! I read this book 3 times and I'm still interested in reading it 4 times.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Great book! I've read the first one (beautiful creatures) and loved it. I plan on reading the whole series. It's a great story with a magical twist with out being crony or dry, hope you enjoy it like I did.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|Boys typically like anything they can construct and then cut down and this fits the bill for my grandson. He makes and destroys stuff  and loves it.
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|it is high quality and full of fun, the minifigures are quite cute. It is worth the price. good enough.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Emma Watson is fantastic.  She and both her co-stars to an excellent job and give life to a wonderfully moving story.
B00CSR2J9I|3.0|I love this game at first I wasn't so sure about getting it but now I know that it is awesome GET IT NOW PERSON BYe!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Excited to read the next book and see what happens next.  Took awhile to get all the characters figured out, but enjoyed reading about all of them, especially enjoyed Tryion Lannister.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|It was amazing this book really captivate s the reader ans makes you want to learn more about each of the characters.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|Couldn't put the book down, read it in five days which is quite good considering I work full time.  A must for lovers of fantasy books.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|very well written and intense. The Swedish aspect was unusual an spell binging.  why do I need seven more words
B00004XQP4|3.0|Punk-pop-rock band Green Day released their fourth major label album \\"Warning\\" in 2000. This album marks a departure for the punk band and sounds a lot like Bob Dylan on steroids. While I like Dylan as much as the next guy, this album took quite a while to grow on me, and still to this day is my least favorite Green Day record.<br /><br />The biggest change in this record is that the balls out, hard cranking punk rock is all but gone on this release. This album sounds more like a band that wanted to mature their image while still having some fun in doing so. The album brings in all kinds of instruments that you never thought you'd hear on a Green Day album. You get some accordion, saxophone, harmonica and even some piano as well. The songs are also much slower and more relaxed as well. This isn't a Michael Bolton record mind you, but if you didn't know it was Green Day, you'd be hard pressed to imagine that it was them. I, did, however, like songs like \\"Warning,\\" \\"Minority,\\" \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Blood, Sex and Booze.\\"<br /><br />This isn't a terrible album now that I look back on it after thirteen years, but it sure was different when it came out. I suggest you buy the record, but be warned it's not your typical Green Day sound.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Let me see ? I need twenty words to qualify for my expressed views which are excellent ?  Just how mqny more words do I need to express my ideas ?  You begin to sound like the vicious catholic nuns who strove to make me hate reading except the lives of their so called saints
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!<br /><br />Would read it again if I could!!! Can't wait for the next book! On pins and needles for it!!!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|You never get tired of this app! It is the best! You can give them face masks and then you put makeup on her then you can put a dress on her, and many more accessories on her, please get this app, it is awesome and great for girls.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Love love love this series. It twists and turns and keeps you wanting more. Clary and Jace are that epic couple you root for always. And Simon is the best vamp I've read in ages
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series and look forward to future stories in this world. A bit hard-boiled, layered on top of sci-fi. A great read.
B00ACP3OOM|5.0|A few friends and I got this as a gift for a friend who's a swimmer. He said that it worked out of water, and worked even better in it. I'm so glad we got this for him - he loves it!<br /><br />Note: I also sent an email to amazon to request for a quality check of my item before sending it out, as I saw from the reviews that the biggest problem seems to be quality consistency. They replied to say that they will, and we did receive a working product :)
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Very excellent movie, Johhnie Depp and Angelina Jolie were terrific together.This was a most enjoyable movie.Great chance to see a clever turn in the plot.
B003NS2T9G|5.0|I started watching this show and enjoyed every minute of it . The show takes on many different subjects that it is way cool.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book kept me guessing the whole way (maybe I'm easy to keep off track?). Loved the ending. Worth the read!
B00003CXA6|5.0|This being the 150th anniversary of the Civil War , This movie brings the Battle to the public in a big way .
B001IF277K|5.0|My Experia x10 is still hanging on to life with this battery. Received battery quickly and popped it in with no problems. Over 10 months later, still holding a good charge.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|It was much the same as any other Eagles' performance that I've seen.  Pretty much a perfect reproduction of all of their hits with little risk-taking.  Even though I really like Joe Walsh, I would have probably also toned down his goofing around and goofy appearance.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|THIS BOOK IS THE BEST BOOK EVER!!! Such a good point behind it, very descriptive, so just forget the movie this is 10X better, I am so exited to read the next one. YAY!!! ONE MILLION STARS
B002UD56I6|2.0|Somehow I was expecting more music.  What I got was heavy on the production end of things and short on musical entertainment.
1609611543|5.0|It answers so much about how food really works on your body. We recommend this in our natural health clinic to everyone who is tired of being tired and tired of being sick. This is a must read!
B00BEXB18M|5.0|Of course I expected it to be good and I was not disappointed. Megadeth will always be my top favorite.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|This is a very heart warming movie. My family loved it! It arrived on time and was packaged well. Great movie for adults who remember Atari and a great movie for kids who like heart warming with action.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I liked this because it kind of helps explain my life. I enjoy its story and the way it was set up.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|My son and husband give this movie 2 thumbs up. They watched it 3 times in the theaters. They finally bugged me enough that I watched it. I loved it too.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I love all the actresses.  Very fun to watch.  I'm glad I joined Amazon Prime.  I get to watch my movies free!
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|The storyline is flat, and to be honest, I didn't need to see giants biting the heads off people throughout the film. I got the message the first time out. They eat people. Just once is enough to put the fear into it. This film just seemed gratuitous with it. The film makers should have focused more on story and less on the gore.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Great site for sharing large files.  Easy to share, easy to retrieve even for the technically-challenged.  Makes it easy to work with clients.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is an awesome game. Its very entertaining. It keeps me playing a little more everyday. I completely recommend this game.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I was pleased how this movie was done, as a prequel to the Wizard of Oz it seemed to make sense. The story line was pretty cool, and the graphics were awesome. I would recommend seeing this movie no matter what your age is.
B00BSBY38A|1.0|Don't even bother. I had to watch because someone else wanted. There is no message, no story and no nothing. You will be waiting for something the entire movie, and it will not come.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|It is a funny, entertaining, different movie about sombies, not the usual 2 hours killing spree. Recommended to have a nice evening.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I will have to watch it again. I think there is too much detail to fit in a movie. This would have to be a series.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The plot description interested me because of my Southern background. In my opinion, the novel read like a soap opera with quickly-resolved conflicts and sanitized characters. Slavery was far more complicated than this novel describes and had to have a far more intense effect on one's sense of freedom & individuality, even on those assigned to the kitchen house.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Good app. Fun to do.  It is a challenging site and takes a while to figure out.  I recommend this one.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|the battles are fun and the game goes fast but I just wish it was a little more creative than any other game when u build a kingdom
B005K17RU0|2.0|This app had been great until it updated a few days ago now there is no radar and the tools have disappeared.
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is a really cute movie to watch with the kids.  It was especially nice because it was an Easter gift and had the little eggs.<br /><br />This was shipped in a timely fashion and arrived in new condition.<br /><br />I would recommend this purchase to others.  It was a good experience.
B007SGM084|4.0|The actual story line behind this erotic series us awesome however, it is poorly written. Description words remain the same throughout all the books which trends to become a but irritating. Overall all I would recommend it though.
B0053FANRC|2.0|I wish I hadn't wasted my money. This obviously was a bad attempt at a sequel.  A better sequel would have cast the original characters.
1449410243|1.0|this wasn't worth the money. I threw it out before I was one forth done. It was so stupid and boring...........hope I never make another mistake like this again.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game me and my sister really enjoy playing it..its almost like having a real horse..this game is somewhat like farmville on Facebook.
B00DC7N9NS|2.0|The special effects were the best part about this movie from viewing the movie on a small screen like In a penny arcade to the lavish colors in the land of OZ.  The costumes and everything was over the top. The story was a little weak. Would have like to seen more about the wicked witches and why they hated Glenda and why did it have to be a man that turned one of the sisters evil. Oh we'll it was good brain candy for an hour and a half.
B001EN71CW|5.0|After seeing Serenity and hearing people mention liking this I gave it a go and watched the first 3 or so episodes on a cable marathon and like it enough to pick this up.<br /><br />All I can say is Shinny :D<br /><br />What a shame the network messed up this shows chances.
B00AMHFMIG|4.0|This item arrived in the time frame and the condition that was promised. I love this show it really is very funny. Thank you for selling this product in the condition that was promised.
B007T99ENE|4.0|This is a well researched history of the MI5 and MI6 in the 1970's and was an enjoyable read.  The ending keeps one guessing but on the whole I found it slightly disappointing for an Ian McEwan book.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I just can't get over the blatant disregard for physics that is the zombie, but the human stories are interesting.
0525953590|4.0|To me, this book reads like a thriller--what will happen next?  While the \\"god-particle\\" escaped much media attention, this book will fill you in.<br /><br />The author, Sean Michael Carroll, Ph.D. is a physicist from the California Institute of Technology who focuses his research on cosmology, namely relativity and dark energy/matter.  \\"The Particle at the End of the Universe\\" is told from Carroll's point of view leading up to the discovery of \\"the God Particle.\\"  He begins the book by providing a background to the discovery and how the particle had been often theorized, but not yet found.  I imagine that for most readers, you would need a fair amount of interest in scientific research to enjoy this book; but for those of us who do, the read hits you right down the middle.<br /><br />On the whole, my only disappointment with this book is that, at points, I had to force myself through the book in anticipation of what would happen next.  I was thankful that the latter half really picked up a lot of steam and rewarded me for having made it to that point (allegorical of the finding perhaps?).  I have to warn to potential readers that not all phenomena mentioned in this book are yet labeled \\"fact,\\" for example, Carroll often refers to gravitons when describing theories, though these particles are, at this point, still theoretical themselves.  The other unfortunate aspect is that this book had to span two genres between popular literature and deep physics--I think this presented a lot of restrictions.  Carroll explains quantum field theories and the mechanisms that drive them in a way that may displease persons particular to one genre or the other, yet I think he did an amazing job of reaching readers \\"in the middle.\\"
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I absolutely love this CD! I was NOT disappointed in the least!  True to New Kids' style, it has some slow songs, but all the others are more dance/techno than past CDs. I didn't get the typical boy band feel when listening to each song. I like what they've done on these songs!  I'm so glad they're back in it!! I love NKOTB!!!
B00ARVRD1Q|3.0|If you like flapper-era jazz, then you'll like this, especially if you're a Roxy Music fan. There's no singing by anyone, though, and it's better appreciated by vinyl lovers who like a good sounding album than by anyone who wants to listen to a cool new CD or download.
B002WSASIC|5.0|This is a powerful display of how racism is passed on from generation to generation as well as peer to peer. The message in this movie is that the irrational propagation of hate has to be stopped cold turkey. It's also about, no matter how hard it is, we can all change. I would recommend this movie as an educational piece for any bigot out there.
B002N5N5M0|2.0|I thought this was brand new.  I paid almost $30 for it and what a terrible picture.  No other DVDs bought from Amazon have been this bad.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|if you liked 100 floors you will like this game.  you have to figure out the clues in each room and complete them in the correct order to advance
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Very engrossing story of enduring hardship and triumphing! A story of family and survival, you will laugh and cry, really!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I had heard several people express disappointment with this novel, so i was pleasantly surprised that it came up to Mr. martin's previous standards in every way I could think of.  The story is gripping.  My one complaint is the ending which left me in agony waiting for the next book.  Was that really necessary considering the length of time we have to wait?
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|This is your typical Matt Damon role and Danny Devito has a great role which does not disappoint can you see crooked lawyer. A David and Goliath flick yes I would watch this again.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|So I contacted Rovio about the app crashing when I try to load the new Cloud levels.  They said it's an Amazon issue and they released the fixed version over 2 weeks ago.  So why haven't we received the updated version?  We are paying customers here.  As Kindle Fire owners we already pay more for our apps and wait longer than any other customers for updates.  I want my fixed update.  I don't think it's too much to ask for decent customer service when you pay for an item.  If Rovio sent the fixed update two weeks ago we should have had the update for two weeks....but no matter how many times I sync my Kindle Fire, update my apps, or restart my Kindle Fire I STILL have no fixed update.  Fix this or refund the money we paid for this app.<br /><br />Shoddy customer service causes angry customers that tell other potential customers how horrible of an experience they've had.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book was a huge waste of time, nothing really progressed. I was bored the whole time. This was not at all as interesting as the first two books......I can't believe I waited all that time for this, and to top it off we have to continue to wait for another ending, not to mention this was supposed to be a trilogy.
B002LVVCQM|1.0|I hope that Dawkins gets right with the God who created him (and everyone and everything else) before it is too late. Darwin knew one second after he died that his unproven, and impossible to prove, \\"theory\\" was wrong. The evidence for the Biblical account of creation is overwhelming. Dawkins and all those who reject God in favor of the silly theory of evolution remind me of the Scripture that states, \\"professing to be wise they become fools.\\" Don't make a monkey out of yourself, get right with God by biblically believing in Jesus Christ. It is the only way to eternal life in heaven. You don't want to spend eternity in hell. You might not believe in heaven and hell now, but you will when you die. But then it will be too late. Now is he time of salvation.

B00D6SBOWG|5.0|So happy to have on my Kindle.  One of my favorite card games on my computer and now I can take it anywhere.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Love that Rod's writing again. Really enjoy listening to songs from &#34;him&#34;; yes,  the words are from a bit older and wiser Rod, but I love them just the same. As far as the &#34;voice&#34; - LOVE it , LOVE it , LOVE it - Rod Stewart has always had one of my most favorite voices ( I am partial to GREAT signature voices) and HE&#34;S STILL GOT IT! This CD will soon be a match to all my other Stewart discs - well worn and well loved! Thanks Rod, for more great music to add to my collection!
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|The price is good, and the music is just so beautiful. It is a must-have for those people who play the last of us!
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King knows how to spin a tale.  Unlike many of his longer books, this one is a simple story with an uncomplicated story line, perfect for summer reading.
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|Good stories.  Always difficult to get my ear tuned in to British speak but once I do I enjoy the shows.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great game. still learning the ropes but theory is great. A tad slow on income but promising. works great on first generation Kindle Fire. Kindle Fire circa 2011. Good recommended game.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|best game ever. this game is awesome for people that like clgames where you have to find the things to pass a level.on the down side though it is only 10 levels.
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I bought this for my kids. It required me to download the Amazon application to download. I put the app on the phone , paid for the game . Removed the Amazon app, then tried to open the game. it will NOT work without keeping the Amazon app on the phone also. I refuse to let my kids have that type of access on their phone. i just wanted the game, not having something totally useless as an app with an unplayable game. Had to give it a one star would give it less if I could. i am rating Amazon's practices, can't rate something that I can't play. I will NEVER BUY ANY GAME FROM AMAZON APP EVER AGAIN!
B001AIY58O|5.0|One of the best cheesey, futuristic action movies ever.  3 seashells, Wesley Snipes?!?  C'mon now, how can you beat that? Nuff said.

B00DBSZ6ZC|5.0|this movie started and ended with action. I felt like 10 minutes but it was no way near there. great movie and the witches were out of this world crazy. I thought it would be some kind of kid movie but it wasn't.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I liked \\"City of Bones\\".  It was a quick and entertaining read.  Maybe I psyched myself up too much for it though.  So many people I know raved about it and I wanted to read the first installment before the movie was released in theaters.  However, I read a lot of paranormal young adult stories and this series starts out like a lot of them.  Teenage human girl (Clary, here) doesn't realize that she isn't exactly human.  Its been hidden from her for her own safety.  Then something happens and she is thrust into this new found world of magic and adventure.  Once there, sorry, this book really does feel like its taken liberties from the Harry Potter novels.  The villian in the book is Valentine, and yes he is pretty darn creepy, but he also reminded me of Voldemort with his passion to end all Downworlders (Vampires, fairies, werewolves) and make a more purebread (Shadowhunter) society. Clary becomes immersed in this Shadowhunter world and must fight for her mother even after her mother kept the world and her own past from her.<br /><br />Along the journey we meet Clary's best friend who wants to be more: Simon, a human.  He was my absolutely favorite character...followed by Alec.  There is a lot to Alec I bet but we don't learn much in the first book.  I am intrigued.  Then there is Alec's sister Isabelle (who is just there, don't feel like I know her yet). The siblings are both Shadowhunters.  Then there is their 'adopted' brother Jace.  I wanted to like Jace, I have heard so much about how wonderful he is...but he just didn't work for me.  He is cocky and sarcastic and that was kind of fun.  He has some good lines but that is about it.  Maybe he will grow on me.  Two other characters of note are father figure Luke, the alpha werewolf and warlock Magnus Bane.  Magnus is eccentric and reminds me a little of Mernin from Morganville Vampires, but Mernin is actually insane I think.  Right now I love Mernin more.<br /><br />The story was ok.  The pages moved quickly so it was an enjoyable read however I really think Clare could've done a better job of explaining the world.  The runes sometimes were unclear and yet they were very convenient. If there was a crisis situation, lo and behold there was always a rune to help them out.  Some of the best parts of the book were the passages that explained the history of the Shadowhunters.  I just wish there was more clarification going on.<br /><br />I did enjoy the Clary/Jace twist but I didn't like the idea of another overdone Young Adult love triangle.<br /><br />Still I bought most of the rest of the series so something about this book must have stuck with me.  I look forward to seeing the movie and hoping that it pulls me further into this series.was an enjoyable read however I really think Clare could've done a better job of explaining the world.

B00B97SNDY|5.0|I saw Dawes open for Bob Dylan at Cornell University and, despite the good music to come, would have been happy to leave after their one hour set-- they were that good. They seemed to cast a spell on the audience of thousands, drawing quiet appreciation even from those (most of us I suspect) who hadn't heard them before and couldn't understand the lyrics in the stadium setting.<br /><br />I thought of Jackson Browne immediately and this comparison held up upon listen after listen of Stories Don't End (especially once I could understand the lyrics). This comparison, which they might tire of hearing, is not a simple one. Not &#34;this could be Jackson Browne,&#34; but a reminder, &#34;this is why I like Jackson Browne.&#34; The essence of their music is so similar to Browne's early albums, Stories Don't End most of all, and still wonderfully its own experience. I love Taylor Goldsmith's lyrics-- emotionally evocative in a way that builds over time, rather than becoming stale. The stories are at once familiar and novel, as is the instrumentation-- particularly the drums.The vocals are gorgeous and unaffected.<br /><br />These songs are meant to be listened to as an album. While I like some more than others-- From the Right Angle, Just Beneath the Surface, Someone Will-- they stand together so well as a whole.  Having now heard all three albums, I like the way in which Stories Don't End holds together most of all. Having it on vinyl encourages me to listen to it as a whole and I'm glad.
B003L77FYS|5.0|I love them. Now I can watch it whenever I want.  One of the best programs on TV today.  now if they can go down on season 5 price I'll get that one soon when it comes out.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I really an not sure what the big fuss was about this movie - Jennifer Lawrence and Bradely Cooper were great - the story seemed choppy to me so i decided to read the book - there is a lot of repetition that i find overdone - overall  - thought it was ok.
B007N8RULO|4.0|The only thing I wish is that it had the free spaces like the original game does on your computer.  It's hard to win the multi suit games without them.  I still like having it though and for free you can't complain.
B00846REIS|3.0|Seems to me to be the same story as Fifty Shades of Grey (which I read First) but with better writing - the characters are flawed, they fall in love immediately, he is rich - she is clumsy - you know the deal!
0525952926|5.0|Years ago I came across & read Ken Follett's Pillars of The Earth & was hooked. I then suggested my 2 daughters to read it & they were hooked. We then continued to read his Trilogy series & have not been disappointed.

B007KOMTUI|5.0|Dont know what i'm gonna do when Don Draper and company end after next season! If you were raised in the 60's this show is a must see
B004UHL9EK|4.0|The product works well as a timer and stop watch. It allows you to save multiple timers by name. I found it awkward that along with the alarm it also speaks the name you give the timer. The start and pause buttons are on a pop up window with about 16 buttons. I find it a little confusing to find the button I need, otherwise I love the product.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I really tried to complete this book...after all i read the other two - but these two make me want to pull my hair out - i put it aside for now and may try to pick it up again later - when i found out there may be 1 or 2 more i pretty much felt done - these two exhaust me!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I was about to install this app untill I read the permissions it wants on your phone.  It wants to know your location, like where you're at all the time; home, work, store, etc. Via the cell towers you use.  It wants access to your contacts stored in your phone;  I'm sure family and friends don't appreciate you sharing their info with some company.  I can't imagine anyone installing this app.  Please pay attention people.  There are other Bible apps that don't abuse unsuspecting consumers.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book came recommended to me by my daughter who read it with her book club.  The first part is quiet annoying with all the back and forth - the second part sent me for a loop - didnt see that coming - but what happens at the end i think is a cop out - i think the author just didnt know how to end it and it just didnt work for me
0399165274|3.0|I've read a number of Frederick Forsyth's novels, but just his early stuff (The Day of the Jackal, The Odessa File, The Dogs of War, The Devil's Alternative, The Fourth Protocol).  I remember really enjoying those books, so I had pretty high expectations for The Kill List.<br /><br />But I was disappointed. I don't think character development was ever really one of Forsyth's strengths, but in his earlier novels the plots were fairly intricate, there were always at least a few twists, and the obvious depth of his research provided details that made the unfamiliar settings of his novels (the world of espionage, merecenaries, etc.) really pop. But in The Kill List, everything seems sort of bland and generic, and the characters are incredibly one-dimensional.<br /><br />I think one thing that has happened is that the bar has been raised considerably for this type of writing.  In the early part of Frederick Forsyth's career, he was one of the few people writing carefully researched novels of this type.  It is now a quite crowded field and the ring of authenticity that set Forsyth's earlier work so far apart is a bit more common now.  I think the other problem with The Kill List is the simplicity of the plot, which is essentially, \\"Here's a good guy...here's a bad man, as I will show for a few chapters...now watch the good guy go after the bad man.\\"  Novels like The Dogs of War and The Devil's Alternative had some interesting moral gray areas that lent them some depth and tension, and The Kill List has none of that.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This was a great extension on the series! The follow up from the previous books, including the inserts here and there refreshing my mind of who is who and other details, was well written. I felt a little unsatisfied at the end though. I felt the ending was the end of a chapter, not the end of the book. The other books gave closure by the end to whatever predicament was going on. This book created so many new paths, and revealed so many details, which opened a whole new set of doors, but then it left me standing in the doorway. As always I'm looking forward to the next book in the series, but only because I feel this one left me hanging.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very fun app!  Challenging but not too hard.  Hope they come out with more levels soon. Thanks for making this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|accurate way more than the weatherman, or any other new site out there! I always rely on weather channel maps and common sense before anything!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm totally hooked on this TV series!  It is so well done! I hate the thought of it ever ending!
1781162646|4.0|I had stopped reading Stephen King because for me he had gotten too weird .When his newest book came out I decided to give him another shot. Joyland turned out to be a pleasant surprise. Devin Jones, a 3rd year college student, takes a job for the summer working for a carnival. He enjoys it so much he postpones his return to school and stays on for the winter. With a friends' help he delves into the mystery of a young  woman who was murdered on one  of the rides.We follow Dev as he deals with the breakup  with his girlfriend,how he handles his friendship with a dying boy and also faces his own possible fate of being murdered. Great storytelling by a master.

B004EYSXT8|4.0|describes how myelin is formed and its role in learning.<br />mostly, it is a book about how to learn. whether it is myelin or not, it tells what works. same goes for the writers booklet &#34;The Little Book of Talent: 52 Tips for Improving Your Skills&#34; which i recommend for those wanting a short version of how to practice.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|This lego set is great for starters with kids.  However, the box is misleading, because there are not that may pieces to go in the box.  Order extra legos.
B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|Good album but doesn't keep momentum or the smoothness that Black Gives Way To Blue did. Good album just not a lot of stand out songs/singles. Alice in Chains keeping the grunge movement alive.
B0002HWJY6|5.0|This is perfect for a 1 year old's smurf themed cake.  We are using it in conjunction with several other pieces.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is amazing.  I have been doing it about every other day for two weeks.  I am really seeing results.  Yes, the workout is very challenging, but its only 20 min long so that a huge motivator and it makes it easy to fit into my busy schedule.  The workout is challenging, but not impossibly challenging- like a similar workout dvd I had tried in the past.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game I started playing on my moms phone and I fell in love with this game. It is a thrill rush and it is adicting and you will need a few hours, your charger, and the things you don't need to do
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Response was , very delighted and interest in Roman History was born to this young man.  He thanked me and said he would watch over again.
B0073TZ1AA|5.0|As being an author sometimes when writing a story it is nice to hear what you have written but you may not want to share your works with anyone just yet.Well with this program I'm able to save my work as a PDF and have it spoken back to me as i read along giving me the opportunity to edit as I may hear any errors. The voice is a bit 'tinny' but most of the pronuncations are right on.<br />I highly reccomend.
B000QQZHCY|4.0|I've liked Kamelot for years now, but for some reason I've never heard this album in its entirety until now.  It has all the elements that make Kamelot a great band, excellent vocals, great combination of Metal and Classical elements, good songwriting, etc.  And while I may not like it quite as much as &#34;Ghost Opera&#34; or &#34;The Black Halo&#34;, I will definitely listen to it a lot.
B005PK57IK|4.0|Some of the lawyers are as sleazy as we give lawyers credit for being but they dress nice. Well, it's only a movie.

1416987118|5.0|Exciting story.  My grandchildren love this book, and relate it to going through the woods at the cabin.  They insist on reading it over and over.  It's fun to listen to them tell other people the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game so exited everytime I play this but it could get hard sometimes it gets fast really quick
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I've tried the other flow apps, such as Free Flow &amp; Flow Bridges, but this app is better yet! I like how each app starts you out with ridiculously easy puzzles and eases you into the harder ones because they can get real tricky! The best part about this app is the sounds that it makes as you solve each puzzle; it sounds as if I'm tapping the keys on a keyboard or something! If you enjoy a challenge and/or liked playing the other Flow apps then you'll definitely love Neon Flow!!
0307346617|5.0|This was the first zombie book I've ever read. I couldn't put it down! I didn't want it to end.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I always get so nervous when one of my favorite authors come out with a new book, afraid that it might not live up to the high standards I have come to expect. Gaiman didn't disappoint! Still one of the only authors who can pull off fantastic adult fairy tales, not fairy tales for kids/teens that adults happen to like. Only bad part was that it was over so fast!!
B005FLX1HS|5.0|This is a great album it was money well spent. This album would be meant for anyone who loves skrillex.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love love love to play. Have it on two phones and my tablet too. However could use better incentive to play especially on higher levels to get more exotic fish. It tends to get boring if u do not want to exhaust your pearls on plants u have plenty of within the reef.
B0053TMP24|5.0|As always Rick Riordan is truly an amazing author. His book are so lifelike and I enjoy every single bit. His books are truly masterpieces.
B00CRS88IO|2.0|The idea of telling Ian Flemming's wartime experiences is a great one.  His life is one of those that proves the adage truth is stranger than fiction.  Unfortunately the author seemed to think that adding ridiculous exaggerations was required.  If you're looking for a historical novel look elsewhere.  If, on the other hand, you want a James Bond spoof, this is the book for you.
B006H8BIIM|3.0|Space Station is exactly what I wanted. A space game about mining. I've always loved resource collecting, and so should you!<br /><br />Do you love the space game? You'll surely love this game.<br /><br />I do have a few gripes, however. The game is too grindy, and brought the game to a standstill for me. I have no want to return. I don't care about the story, characters, or anything in the game. I just want to collect resources, but to collect them effectively you must grind.<br /><br />If you're into playing games to grind, this may be for you. It's not game breaking, and you can buy all the equipment, but it does bother me that it takes so long. You eventually unlock ways to get more points to unlock equipment... But it just doesn't stack up for me. Decent enough game, perfect in terms of what I was searching for, but grinding...
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love the speed n ease of this app. I Use it daily!!!!  Much better than the one that runs on my Nook. Go kindle!!!!!
B00B7Y0206|3.0|I've given this application three stars because I didn't feel it deserved anymore. It simply helps you view youtube videos. I won't mention the downloading part, being that it is illegal. I took no part in it, I only used this application once to watch a video.<br /><br />I can say what it does is helps you circumvent Youtube blocks on mobile content, which it did fantastically, at least for me. Besides that it just delivers content, has a decent search feature, and besides that not much else seemed different.
B000SEI230|4.0|I watched the movie years ago and loved it. I decided that I wanted to read the book, as books are always better than the movie. I wasn't disappointed; this was one of the best stories I've ever read.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|This game is a great download. It has wonderful graphics and fight scenes making it an amazing FREE app. Reason for 4 stars: I have troubles with updates. Whenever I get told to download a new version it opens an internet tab then brings me to the appstore and nothing else happens.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I think this is a 4 star [****]  because sometimes the colors [black, sepia, and white] Are frustrating to read becuase of that. But other than that it is a easy wasy ti use a Dictionary!! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Sometimes I can get tricked but otherwise this app is awesome it is kind of hard but some of it is easy it is the best app ever. Thank you MobiGrow!
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|all of the lead actors in the film are accomplished with many films to their credit. maggie smith in particular has been quite funny in those recent seasons of DOWNTON ABBEY---but everyone just tries too hard in this not so funny comedy about an accomplished artist moving into a nursing home of filled with other retired musicians and singers and wannabe singers/musicians who are trying to put on one last great concert to save the home from being shut down.<br /><br />maybe it was the casting. maybe it was the script. maybe it was the directing. maybe it was a bit of all three coming off as too obvious or forced--which made the film sort of plod along. can't recommend the film
B005M4EM5S|5.0|I read the book when it first came out and then listened to just this last month. I enjoy the listening partly because you can't breeze over parts like you can with a printed or ebook. Sounds like the same crew from the Wheel of Time reading and they do an excellent job! A massive story and I can't wait for the next one!
B00CWV8X04|2.0|talk about depressing and bleak. relentless from beginning to end. couldn't figure out why the filmmaker wanted me to watch this film. everyone plays it somber. the tone and look of the film is depressing. the subject matter about drugs and overdosing and this and that just further pushed me away. it's a shame b/c there is a really strong cast in place. one of the top film directors living today. a well written script...i just think it falls into the category of &#34;why was this movie made in the first place?&#34; that question probably has an answer that will never satisfy me. skip this film and go watch TRAFFIC again to see this director doing some of his best work.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Excellent story.  New ideas and thoughts shake our beliefs in zombies to allow new avenues of story lines.  Will read it again and again.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I ended up watching this movie because I was really bored, and honestly I wasn't really crazy about Katy Perry. But this movie completely changed my mind. I view her in such a different light now. She really worked hard for what she has now and she deserves everything she has. It shows how good a person and artist Katy is. I mean she sucked up her feelings and performed even when she was depressed. That shows pure courage to show her emotions to her fans. And it shows how much she cares for them, because she didn't have to go on stage when she was crying but she did. She is such an inspiration and this movie changed the way I think about her!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I thought it was too much like Lord Of the Rings movies and also I thought it was too long.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|I enjoyed reading but felt that no character was ever sufficiently developed, leaving me craving more. Good war scenes and details.

B003H4I4JU|4.0|Slow to get started, but all in all I enjoyed the read. Not a &#34;space western&#34;, more thought provoking. Worth the time.
0316113077|3.0|This book was not bad, but not good.  Seller had good timing on book and it was a very clean product, but it was more reading than demonstration, I think
B003H4I4JU|5.0|I just finished this book and it has to be the best book I have read in recent memory. Such an in depth story with every detail to be answered for and no questions left at the end except for &#34;what happens to Lusitania??&#34;. I loved this book and now it's on to Xenocide!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was great...but I felt like it was a build up to a boring climax. Pretty Disappointed with the ending.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's an amazing game. I would like it if you could help us get lots of coins,gems, and help our horse get more energy.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|If you plan on changing cpu blocks at all get this stuff. One tube will last a long time. Remeber only a pea sized amount in center of cpu chip.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is pretty well done. I definitely play this quite a bit since the advertisements are not in the way of the screen during game play
B00AALX5SI|4.0|Went in to this not knowing what to expect but was surprised at how well the story telling was. To see the ups and downs and the struggle to put on a smile even when the crap hit the fan was a surprise but good movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you love solitaire get this app, totally worth being free. I have this app on my phone as well.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is great. It challenging but not impossible. It makes you think and is not one of those games you can get through in ten minutes. Awesomeness!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am addicted to this series! Good writing, good acting, great entertainment! I can't wait to watch more of it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really appreciate the challenges!! They were difficult but not impossible!! I could play it all day and I'm not a \\"gamer\\"
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It's great, I use it 2-6 times a day. I think everyone should have this app. Thank you for this free app.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved the intricate details the mystery and suspense. The story continues can't wait to read book three of the best-selling books
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|The phone fits fine by itself, but if you have any covers on your phone it will not fit.  If you put the phone into the pouch with the 'on/off' button facing down, the phone continually restarts itself among other things.
0679721037|3.0|I believe this book is not that recommended but should be read only if you are interested in bombings and history. This book was mainly about telling the story of six individual characters of their prespective of the hiroshima bombing and how it affected them. Even though i love books that have to do with multiple prespectives, this book in particular didn'd really catch my attention. Not the best book, but it was ok.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I have a Samsung GS3, my wife has an iPhone 4s and an iPad2. We were able to fast charge all. Of these devices using this adapter(of course only one of the apple devices at a time. though I had to get a new usb cable for the GS3 so if you are having trouble with it fast charging try a better cable first. A true lifesaver since when I am running navigation on my GS3 with the screen at full bright, it will slowly drain the battery if it doesn't recognize the charger as a fast charge device, and we are halfway through a 3000 mile road trip that would have my phone die even though it was plugged in if the charger wasn't up to the task.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|I think one of S K's best books ,would recommend to anyone who likes this genre dealing with time travel.
0062011847|5.0|Its a discworld book, its always worth reading. One of the best Vimes stories yet. So if you like the Discworld series your collection won't be complete without this.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I liked it more than the kids.  Great twists and turns keeps it very interesting.  Don't pay attention to negative reviews.  Awesome movie
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I had a blast playing this game, this game is very highly addictive I would definitely recommend this game to anyone.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this app is really great. You have to destroy all the humans in the world! It also has good graphics. buy this app. You won't regret it!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I liked it a lot.  Couldn't stop playing.  I would definitely play another like this. Please make more games soon!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I honestly didn't think this game would actually earn 5 stars. I thought I would actually have to pay money to play it eventualy but to my relief that didn't happen. This game is great esspecially for horse lover's like myself.
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This gift is definately a win! I got it for my Dad because I knew he would like it. I saw the first two seasons and really liked the show. I bought both seasons for him as well. Now my Dad can watch both seasons with my Mom!
B004FN16DS|4.0|Chang revisits basic assumptions that govern thinking about capitalism.  In the end, Chang is in favor of coordinated, Big Government intervention.
B000FC146C|5.0|Captivating story of the Cleary family. Long time since I've read an epic like this. Couldn't put it down. Well worth reading.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This is a good coming of age movie.  The script is well written and the acting endears the viewer to the characters.  It struck me as The Breakfast Club for a modern generation.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun, fun, makes you think. Your problem solving skills get used. I do think it is a little silly to have to write so many words when one says it all,fun!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Absolutely thrilling! I cannot wait for season 4 to come out. Highly recommended for all the zombie enthusiasts out there.
193700788X|1.0|Honestly I am a huge fan of the supernatural, and finding out that Sookie eventually gets together with Sam and leaves all the supernatural behind was a bummer!! This ending cused me to HATE the whole series! I AM NOW SO REGRETFUL THAT I WASTED MY TIME READING THIS SERIES WITH AN ENDING THIS BAD! I believe that Sookie should have ended up with Eric. It was not cool of the author to lead us on like that with Sookie and Eric and than suddenly change ways, drop Eric, and continue on with Sam. It was just plain horrible. I mean yes maybe Sam is the best choice for Sookie, but were talking about what the READERS WANT to hear, what they enjoy. As an author she could have at least considered what her ans were asking/ wanting. As a huge vampires fan I was reading the whole series expecting and wishing for her to end up with a vampire (bill or eric), and her drastically changing everything was a huge let down. I was soo shocked! And I mean the ending seemed a bit too abrupt. One chapter they were fighting the suernatural and the next was sunshine and daises with Sam. Again as I said before....WHAT A WASTE OF MY TIME.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Once again, Khaled Hosseini takes several stories of family, love, loss, and betrayal and weaves you in and then brings it all back around at the end.  There is nothing I can say that any of the others have said, just go read this, you will not put it down, and you will wish it would never end!
B00633W614|5.0|This second  installment in the Clifton Chronicles lives up to the first. Archer keeps his audience on edge. I was pleased with the emergence of Emma as a step g female character. Excellent book and I can't wait to begin the final one.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|As others have said, the bar is high. Nevertheless, this is an astounding achievement, bringing together countless scenes from all the books -not just 1 and 10- in the most perfect homage Aubrey (or Capt. Pellew, for that matter) could ever have wanted.<br />I concur with others that Maturin was underdeveloped, but there was little scope in the South Pacific for his sort of work, short of the orlop.<br />Watching this brings a smile to my face and a warm glow throughout. Chapeau.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Great writing, great acting and interesting plot lines make for one of the best on TV, on paid or network!!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Now we finally have the long awaited answers, I can't wait to see what happens next. This is one of the best series out there, not to be missed.
0525953728|5.0|Well done!  Find description of training of Navy SEALS and execution of an important mission.Should be read by all Americans.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|Being a person who is crazy about nature and does nature photography, I fell in love with this movie.  It is very moving and beautiful in many ways, the acting is great, and it is a movie I will watch over and over.  Also, I especially love that it is based on a real person and true events and love her courage and knowledge of who she was and her determination to be true to herself.
B00D2BHO44|5.0|This Game's soundtrack is off the charts! Absolutely beautiful. Creates depth within the game and the music is crisp and clear.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|not sure of the accuracy of his personality; however, I believe he was accurately portrayed as very wise and related to each individual through a story that really resonated with where they were in life... very similar to Christ's technique
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Typical Bond movie with very few new twists. The special effects weren't even very special except for little propane tanks exploding like small nukes.
B00746O3X8|4.0|I read all of the reviews associated with this product before I chose to purchase it. I was most compelled by its price, when compared to the Cotton Carrier. The main misgiving that I have about the Opteka carrier is that the mount that screws into the camera's tripod mount has no provision so that I may attach it directly to a tripod. This is not a big issue for I do believe that I am more likely to be without a tripod when using the carrier, but I like having these choices. Since my tripod features a quick release plate, I will have to remove the Opteka mount in order to attach the plate and then vice-versa.<br /><br />The carrier comes with two safety straps that attach to your cameras. You are going to need the OP/TECH USA Utility Loop Connector in order to use these straps. They come with some split rings that I just don't see attaching directly to my cameras body. I think it would be wise for Opteka to include the loop connectors in this package, even if it means a slight rise in the price.<br /><br />There is a another issue I feel is worth noting. I found it difficult to adjust the Opteka's straps in order to get a good fit. I was able to get it adjusted to where I was comfortable with my initial use. I haven't actually used the carrier out in the field and I suspect that further adjustments will be necessary. I'm 5'11\\" and 200 lbs, so I have a bit of a belly. If the photographs here of this item are representative of the recommended location of the main carrier, then I have a problem. Right now, the main carrier is most comfortable up higher and against my sternum.<br /><br />That should not be construed as a flaw against this product. It is also worth noting that this product comes with a single sheet of paper that is supposed to be some type of user guide, but it is worthless in every sense. You're really on your own in trying to figure out which adjustments should be made first.<br /><br />This is what worked for me:<br /><br />1) set the velcro adjustment strap that is at the main carrier to be loose, for you are likely to want to tighten it up last.<br />2) set the height adjustments to get the main carrier at a comfortable location<br />3) set the side adjustments to create a snug fit<br />4) finally, use the velcro adjustment to fine tune that fit across your abdomen<br /><br />I am going to give this carrier some time to determine if it is really worth it to me to spend the extra $160 for the Cotton Carrier
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is amazing from chapter seven to the last sentence!!!!! Recommended to all adult<br /><br />lt women. It is a must read.

0399226907|5.0|I bought this in the boardbook style as a gift for a one-year old.  Perfect for the little ones to have read to them and for them to pretend to &#34;read&#34; to themselves.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The dialogue is witty and the characters are well drawn. The storyline is engaging and the cinematography is beautifully done.

B00DGN51O8|5.0|Well....we really liked this movie. Great visual, fairly plausible story, very good acting. For me, one of the best parts was the &#34;mechanics&#34; or the &#34;physics&#34; of the.........well, I'm not gonna spoil it for you.<br />  This is a good family adventure film. My wife and I commented several times during the film, &#34;This is a really good movie!&#34; Enjoy!!
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This is a movie for any member of the family. It is also a movie you can watch over and over.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I thought Red was fun and entertaining. Amazon streaming is pretty good, it did freeze up twice for less than 5 seconds even with having high speed internet.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I have been watching this on TV. But I wanted to have it on DVD for at home.  So I can watch any time that I want to just to refresh.  I also have season 1, so one of these weekends that is rainy I'm going to sit down and watch them both. Can't wait for the third season to come out on DVD.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|Considering the number of writers and producers on this album, you would think it would be better. Lyrics were basic. Production seems off. I think if you tie Daft Punk to anything, some people will instantly like it regardless.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This is quite possibly the best, most impact-full book I have ever read! I can't remember a time when I have highlighted so much of any book. This book is well written in that as the material unfolds the writers continue to build on and reinforce the material already presented. The real measure of a book for me though, is it's level of impact on my thinking and/or actions. This book gave me new perspective, a new level of focus, and I am already implementing it's simple concepts. Time will tell if the results are everything I hope for, but I have a hunch It has sent me down the right path!<br /><br />Well done! Must read! Highly recommended!
B0054U56B4|5.0|I love these books! The series is awesome! Kind of like Harry Potter -ish but different in a really cool and magical way. I really recommend the whole series if you're looking to get into something different and new.
B008N1LL42|1.0|Ok was looking for and expecting lite blockbuster entertainment but this was beyond lite with zero nutrition. Holy! Who greenlit and approved cuts on this mess?
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really enjoy this app.  I use it if I happen to miss the weather on TV or to see how close rain is approaching my area.  This app is also very accurate.  The graphics are also easy to read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love having to read on my iPad. Have the books but nice to only have one thing to carry around
B001H4NXCK|5.0|This is a very funny movie.  Mel Gibson is full of wise cracks.  Of coarse, James Garner is always wonderful.
B005HESLUA|5.0|I was watching every Star Trek they put on TV, until Voyager.  Partly personal reasons, I just stopped watching it after the first couple of seasons.  In my mind, TNG was the best, then DS9, then Enterprise, then Voyager.  I've been watching a lot of DS9 on Amazon and decided I was past the chronological point where Voyager started and I wanted to watch them in parallel, so I just finished Season 1 of Voyager.  It gets going much better much faster than either TNG or DS9, in my humble opinion.  Admittedly, I'm looking forward to catching up so I can get some DS9 back in - but that's partly because back over on that side the Dominion War is about to get started and I have fond memories of the show and various video games that came out around that time (Bridge Commander).<br /><br />One thing... Amazon has messed up something and included some Season 2 episodes as part of &#34;Season 1&#34;.  If you go to wikipedia you can see the correct breakdown of seasons.  Only Episodes 1-15 are really part of Season1.  Ep 16-19, which jump to that fall are really the beginning of Season 2.  Not sure why the mistake.  Maybe nobody cares since we're all likely to just binge watch episodes these days :-)
159463176X|4.0|And the Mts. Echoed was well written but more complex than Husseini's other two books.  I found myself getting confused sometimes about who was who, since the plot moved around from character to character a lot and was not strictly linear.  However, many parts of the book were wonderfully told and very moving.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I think this is the app I use most often.  If has all but replaced my clock/radio.  I especially like the white noise and music setting for when I am going to sleep.  The easily adjustable brightness and available weather are also very convenient.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My 3-year-old son is gaga for dinosaurs now so we got him this T-Rex for his birthday. He has several other Schleich dinosaurs, and this one is of the same quality as the others, which is very good. It's nice that his mouth opens and closes. Good product, good toy.
B00271B752|5.0|&#34;Serpico&#34; is based on the real-life experiences of Frankie Serpico, an honest young NYC cop who risks his life by exposing corruption running rampant city-wide on the force. Gritty and grim, this film retains its freshness in its impact on this viewer who had not seen the movie since its release 40 years ago.<br />Al Pacino's performance, in only his second feature to receive top billing, contributes quite well to an argument that Pacino is one of the truly great actors of our time. With DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman entering into movie viewers' lives around the same time, it might become a little too easy to overlook Al Pacino's work. I would encourage film lovers to really dig into the Pacino catalog to share in my appreciation!<br />Despite “Serpico” seeming to be a &#34;one man show&#34; by Pacino, there are also strong performances in key supporting roles, including Cornelia Sharpe as a free spirited girlfriend who helps Serpico develop his undercover self, Barbara Eda-Young as the love of his life who leaves him out of frustration for having to share in his sufferings, and the great but under-appreciated character actor John Randolph as Frankie Serpico's empathetic chief. Tony Roberts’ portrayal of Bob Blair, Serpico’s one friend in the justice department, comes off a little stiff and forced at times; otherwise, the overall cast makes the story so real.<br />Director Sidney Lumet places us right in the heart of the darkest recesses of a 1960's crime-infested New York City, and Al Pacino makes us feel like we’re watching Frankie Serpico in his quest to fight for what is right. Forty years may have passed since this movie's release, but &#34;Serpico&#34; stands the test of time as a &#34;must-see” cinematic classic!
B00D3XAA4M|2.0|This is not a guide but a teaser for the actual guides. However it is free and therefore a good starting point to get ideas to further reading.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I frequently use this app to clear junk files from running apps and closing other apps after I'm finished with them.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Based on a true story.  A family's struggle to overcome the odds.  A family film for 10+ years of age.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow is a great game that is easy to get addicted to. However watch out for there is a glitch every now and then. You have to connect the pipes in a certain order for some of them will stop as you move them. Its trail and error, and doesn't take too much from the game to go below four stars.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|The Iranian hostage crisis was what brought down the Carter administration.

B00COGZ8FU|5.0|A typical Tom Cruise film.  Fast action and a pretty decent story line.  Cruise fits the character very well and does an excellent job in bringing the story line to life.
B007L96VCY|5.0|Been a fan for years....recollecting the old albums.... Wow... What memories!  Bonus disk was just a bit of icing on the cake!
B00908DDZM|4.0|Every song on this album is awesome, but the pacing feels off.  Going from the high energy tunes straight to the deep philosphical ones.  Still, buy it.
0425263924|2.0|Having read the first two novels in this trilogy, I was eagerly anticipating the release of &#34;Entwined With You&#34;. The story picks up where Eva and Gideon left off but then goes through a very mundane description of their everyday, sex-crazed lives without any real action or plot. There were a few times when the tension seemed to ratchet up to tease at a new drama, only to have these issues be explained away in less than a page.<br /><br />I felt that this book was rushed out to meet a deadline with no real thought put into the story line. The story rambles and literally has no plot! I'm saying &#34;CROSSFIRE!&#34; and good bye to these beloved characters....the author killed them with her pen!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This story of loss and bravery leaves us feeling that we would wish to be as Leisel. I am sure that.there were many brave stories from that era.I am finding it difficult to understand that this book would be attractive as a Child's book as the readers really haven't lived long enough to relate to the characters.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I know a lot of people were upset that there are more books to come but I am excited and can't wait to get the next installment.  I like this book because unlike 50 shades they are both messed up and need each other in their own way.  If you haven't read the first two I highly recommend it, especially if you like 50 shades!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was a great watch would recommend to anyone who likes these types of shows. Watched all the seasons. Loved it
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Loved the book until I realized I was at the end! I was so mad! Just as it was getting somewhere!! Grant it, word is for there to be another, but I can't wait that long!!!
B000IFQLBE|5.0|This CD contains a very good mixture of all John Fogerty's music. It's a delight to listen to. Love it!
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I pre-ordered this when i could :) ven though not seeing the movie itself, I keep getting a lot of feedback from my friends saying it is amazing,being on the opsoing side I decided I listen to my friends and i buy this movie, dissapointing I can't see the film in Cinema due to no UK Cinema Release Date, but the DVD will make up for not seeing it at the cinema, I hope this movie is as good as my friends say it is, I look forward to this film with high hopes and anticipation.
0385349947|5.0|I love this book. It is so inspiring. At times it was frustrating or challenging, due to the societal barricades put up around professional women. At the end of the day, it's an issue we need to be aware of.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so cool. I just can never get the keys so when i die i die hdh fhdb dgdg  ssh dg dhdh
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|I bought this book with low expectations and thinking it was the usual message from typical self help books.  This book will exceed your expectations and contains valuable information that you will be able to use
1455828734|5.0|I love the Fever series , You will love this book answers some questions ,you can't put it down ,can't wait to get to the end .but you want it to keep going. I can't wait to see what happens next
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book seems to be an authentic answer to questions many of us have about life after life. It is especially reassuring to those of us who have recently lost, in my case an adult daughter, or other loved one. It is believable, credible and fascinating. It is a book I want to own , refer to often and share with others. For me it is a powerful treasure.<br />Donnie
B00DCX08MW|1.0|This game is great I was excited about getting it ...untill it wanted me to buy to unlock the planes missions and other stuff they only wanted one purchase but I'd rather just buy the whole game because now I can't save my purchase thanks rotors:/ make it 2.99 instead of IAP's  untill this is changed 0 stars if I could
1781162646|5.0|This was quite a different Stephen King novel. I enjoyed it and it kept you going until the end. Not the usual gore that you associate with Mr. King's books. Refreshing and a quick read!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game so far. Love the mini games and competitions. Not too hard. With patience, you dont have to spend real money. ***note*** so many reviews because developer gives you 3 ree gems to rate app.
1439153663|5.0|Along the lines of &#34;The Help&#34; expect it is in the late 1700's to early 1800's so the story line is around slavery and an indentured worker.  The story transports you to another time and accurately depicts the atrocities of slavery as well as the challenges faced by women during this time.  It is the type of book where you miss the characters even before you have finished reading it!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read I am going to read book 2 soon because this one was so good.  I like how the children have special powers and Jake takes a risk and leaves everything behind.  I recommend the series.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The puzzles are clever without being frustratingly hard (which is good because there is no help button).  Each level takes an average of 5-10 minutes to solve.
1590171993|3.0|This contemplative, beautifully written novel detailing the simple life of an English professor (William Stoner) would be an extraordinary reading experience were it not for the hollow, emotionless and socially awkward characters that inhabit it. Everyone seems to live in a vacuum, devoid of any happiness. Stoner's depression-era farm parents are dull enough but why he marries a woman with the personality of a doorknob is mystifying. As he settles into his profession, his teaching career is stymied by the bullish department head Lomax, but Lomax's dislike of Stoner is cryptic. Stoner's one bright spot in his life is an affair with a colleague but even that is soon extinguished. The weariness eventually wore me out although I trudged through to the end. Depressing!
B009O07NMA|5.0|Absolutely love this CD! Every song keeps you going and makes you want to sing along. Bought this on a whim and could not be happier!
006178480X|4.0|OK, James Rollins is one of my absolute favorite authors. I have all his books, have re-read them several times.<br />This one is great, I'm glad I got it, but it's my least favorite, just from purely personal preferences.<br />I've always been fascinated by his \\"situations,\\" but Deep Space has never been one of even my top 10 interests. Ditto for the quantum physics involved.<br />  And, I just did not like the way he ended it. Don't want to reveal too much here, but I didn't like that....technique(?).<br />  All that said, he's still about the best in his genre; I could not put it down, even given the above. It's a major page-turner, and his characters are great. I'm just more anxious now for the next one!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Erotic novel with a very romantic storyline. The characters were very likeable. I would recommend this book. A good read.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|Ang Lee's version of The Hulk is pretty widely panned, and mostly for good reason.  I think that Eric Bana and Jennifer Connely were the only things that movie had going for it.  This, thankfully pretended that version never existed.  The purpose was twofold.  The big one was to help set up the Avengers movie, and secondly to bring a movie version that paid homage to the series and the comic.  There was the requisite Lou Ferrigno cameo, and a posthumous cameo of Bill Bixby via a clip played on TV.<br /><br />I think Norton did a great job as Bruce Banner here.  It is unfortunate that he was replaced (although I do think Mark Ruffalo did a fine job as Banner in the Avengers), although if the rumors of Norton being difficult when it came to making this film are true I can see why he was.  Norton did a great job portraying the conflicted nature of Banner, the frustration and the fear that the character feels.  I also think he has fairly good chemistry with Liv Tyler who played Betty Ross, which was necessary given the role her character played in the story.  The movie does set up a possibility of a sequel, but obviously Marvel has put higher stock in the Iron Man, Captain America and Thor franchises. Whether a sequel to this movie ever gets made, and if so whether it continues the story started here remains to be seen.<br /><br />I think the CGI Hulk is far better in this movie than it was in the Ang Lee version.  I think it was one of the things that detracted from that version of the movie, but the technological advancements in CGI have come a long way, and while the Hulk does not look totally realistic, it looked a lot better.  Ferrigno has gone on record saying he thinks that Hulk should be played by a real person, but given that he is supposed to be 9 feet tall, that is just not practical.  If you notice in the film while Ferrigno is substantially bigger than Norton, he is not that much taller.  And they would have had to go back to the tricks used to film the series like cut aways and filming Ferrigno from below to make him look taller.  A CGI Hulk just works better.  Especially for the battle scenes.  There is just really no way they could have done any of the battles (especially the end battle with Abomination) without the CGI.<br /><br />The movie looks and sounds great on Blu Ray.  The special features consist of some behind the scenes material, making of documentaries, deleted scenes and trailers.  In all, if you are a fan of the Marvel series of movies, while not as strong as the first Iron Man or Avengers, it is on par with the others, and definitely worth adding to your collection.
B0094K1K42|1.0|Not worth my time. Did not finish watching the movie. Disappointed in Charlize. Slow from the start. Do not bother.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This i a excellent show. I am hooked!!!! I ca't wat until Season 5. I fnd myself lookin foward each moring ad gettin on my treadmill s I can watch it on my iPad.
B009EE1GC4|4.0|Such a surprising, lovely movie with an exceptional cast! It never made it to any theater in my area so I'm once again grateful to Amazon ony tv.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Kahled Hosseini excellent again.  Enjoyed both of his previous books .  Learning more about country was so interesting and his characters are always so engaging.
0553801473|3.0|Like the rest of the series a good story but I wish there was an easy way to keep everything straight. By the time the next book comes out I'm going to have to re-read the previous books.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|The Borgias Season 2 continues the Borgia family saga. Great acting, stunning visuals, and gripping story lines make this a must-watch series.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|This book had a great story line and was a good read until about 3/4 way through. The character build up seemed too much for the way the book ended. It was also confusing with the then/now chapter formats. However, this was a good, emotional read that got me thinking.
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my 13-yr-old nephew who is obsessed with all things Zelda, and he absolutely loved it! According to my nephew, this book is a must-have for anyone who claims to be a Zelda fan.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved the pov, it's the first that was that the man told his story completely and first not as a sequel. Characters are fun, dialogue witty and definitely had a few lols and left me with a grin 90% of the time.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Love love love this film. It's intricately plotted, has a compelling story and needs you to provide a bit of concentration to follow along. The effects are just great and the whole ending sequences of the film just blew my mind. I also like that it doesn't neatly wrap everything up and explain it for you, it leaves some questions open. Great movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Very addictive game. Once u Think u know everything, a twist occurs and it keeps you searching for more. A definite keeper for me. My brother also loves it and he is 29...so need I say more.
B008L1PYQU|5.0|I got this LP to get signed by the artist who originally did the cover art. It looks amazing framed.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Lots of plot twists that you don't see coming.  Very interesting read with so much detail about actual places that it is easy to get caught up with the characters.  You must keep reading because you can't wait to see what comes next.  Dan Brown keeps you guessing at which characters are on who's side.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|First 2/3 of the book were great, but then it switched to saying the same thing from another perspective... Nothing new, nothing exciting, no side plot... Sorry but this shouldn't have been a book - there simply isn't enough in there....
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|I read novels because they entertain, and non-fiction for enlightenment. I most enjoy a good novel, based on solid science, that entertains while it enlightens. This is that book. I've not often felt sympathy for the animal rights movement, because I think they show too little respect for humanity. We deserve a higher respect than even chimpanzees, but chimpanzees are our closest living relatives, more like us than even dogs, if that is possible, and they deserve our particular respect and our protection. I'm not ready to become a vegetarian but I now better understand why so many teens struggle with that issue and I have renewed respect for animal rights activists, and like the author, I long for the time when our country more closely resembled a democracy based on respect for civil liberties.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was so good that I went back and re-read The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. Hosseini gives a very graphic view of life as a native in wartime Afghanistan.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|this app will not open when ever I click it it just goes black then goes back to the home screen FIX IT
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is fun with lots of pieces to each floor before you get to the final solution!  You do have to click on lots of things along the way!
B0049VZ222|2.0|I visited the town in Georgia (Senoia) where this show is filmed so wanted to check out one of the shows.  Honestly, it was too violent and too gruesome for me and other adults in my family.  People who like the horror genre would probably like it.  I know it has gotten many awards.  Thanks for making it available to give it a try.
0385349947|3.0|After hearing wonderful reviews of this book, I was excited to read it myself. So I bought the hard cover and read it as I commuted on the Metro North train to and back to New York City. Frankly I had a mixed reaction. Yes Sheryl Sandberg makes a number of good points regarding how women could do more to help themselves, and I particularly liked her comparison of a woman's career to a \\"jungle gym.\\" Yet two things really bothered me. One, almost nothing she talked about in her book was really new to me. That may be because I have been working for ~30 years and have read other books on this topic and attended various women's events. Women in powerful positions and with lots of career experience have been telling what works and does not work in a men's world for years. So I am rather surprised at the \\"Oh, wow! We had no idea women had to lean in\\" reaction coming from so many. Maybe the title of her book was a clever and catchy way to get women's attention, or Sheryl Sandberg has a terrific publicist; in any case, I have not quite figured out the book's magic but my hat's off to her. The second thing that bothered me about this book is more important. Starting with the title, Ms. Sandberg's whole message is focused on what women need to do to get ahead in a men's world. This premise assumes that it is women and only women who need to change. In my opinion, that is like saying that blacks had to push themselves to behave more like whites in order to fit in and get better positions in a white-majority environment. Do we think South Africa could have gone through its transition without the whites in power understanding the native citizens' plight, agreeing to start a conversation and changing their own behavior? Would the civil rights movement in the USA be possible without President Johnson's leadership? I do not mean to equate gender issues to racial struggles; my main point is for us women to get ahead, we also need men to listen, understand and become our partners in this movement. I feel disappointed when I hear of successful women like Sheryl Sandberg, continuing to hold women accountable for why women hold less than 20% of the executive positions. That ratio could change very easily if men in power better appreciated the value of having more women on their staff and agreed to measure themselves against such a goal. God knows there are plenty of very well educated, hard working and smart women in the pipeline. Women can lean in all they want, and I would argue that they have been for quite some time, but in my opinion that's never going to be enough. Actually, this approach is such a women-like thing to do since women typically do not ask for help, instead they try to sort things out on their own by doing more. I think it is time to change the message and start getting men actively engaged in this conversation; I think it is time to ask men to \\"jump in!\\"
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Alex Kendrick has done it again.  Every movie he has made has been outstanding and this is no exception.  In a world where the media tries to make men second class citizens, incapable of leadership, this video presents a very different view of life.  This is all about the importance of strong fathers and the huge impact they can have on our lives.  Get this video, it is really exceptional.
B00136Q342|5.0|If you are Johnny Cash fan, this is the must have album. Most of the big hits are here, and the best versions of them out there.
B0002EXH4K|4.0|Megadeth is slowly becoming one of my favorite metal bands. Metallica and pantera uses to be my favorite but with dime gone and Metallica just putting out ok albums for ten years now( but I thought death magnetic was good). Megadeth just have a bigger catalog of better stuff now including the magnum heavy metal opus countdown. Awesome songs, still keeping the metal edge, while going into a more melodic radio friendly way. Heavier than metallica's black album and in some ways I think better. It seems like a natural progression from rust in piece to this album. This being my favorite era of megadeth ( rust in piece throught youthanasia) being some of my favortive megadeth albums. Amazing catchy riffs, hum along metals songs, this is a metal band blue print for metal bands years to come.
B008NNNF7G|4.0|They have a strong Southern Rock sound, with a little more influence on the Southern part. Great, blusy sound. Enjoyed about 905 of the album. If you like the more rock/blues based southern music, you'll love this.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|I liked this movie a lot simply because it was a very different idea, not the same ole, same ole. It was action packed from the beginning, and I had to pay attention to get it. It did have some language (which I don't really appreciate), but it did not have any nudity or sex scenes which I thought was wonderful. Thanks for producing a movie that's main draw isn't vulgarity! This is a truly creative film! :-)
B00BEZTMQ8|2.0|says brand new but outer case of the dvd is torn up and bashed. Now i have to give this as a bday present all torn and crap
B000FC0P9E|5.0|I have loved Stephen King for years.  I had not read this one.  I am so glad that I did.  It is more a psychological type of book.  It kept me on the edge of my seat.  I stayed up until 3 am to finish it.  No one paints a picture quite like Stephen King.
B008D28HYS|5.0|i really enjoyed this game. i love how it challenges your mind and in the end it makes cool designs.
B005K17RU0|4.0|The first version was good and nicely simple, it gave me all I wanted to know. The upgrade is somewhat confusing with too much information all on one page that you just scroll into view. I suppose I will get used to it
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|The worst book ever...... does not even rate a star.....story was draged out.... Eva is the biggest baby ever.....WFT with then ending????? And now we have to wait for 2 more books??? No thanks

B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This is a fun and challenging tower defense strategy game. There are four tower types so it's pretty easy to get into. The variety of enemies makes for a decent challenge. Can't wait for the kingdom rush frontiers on kindle
B0039PPW60|5.0|I purchased this to assist with running Karaoke on deployment and It works great and does everything I could possibly need to do. For the price, you can't beat it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I Love....Love...yes, abslutely Love, this show! I hope they continue for a long time. Some of the greatest actors and actresses are in this show. You get drawn in from the very first one and all through the other seasons. I can hardly wait until the new ones come out. Excellent program.
B008602KQI|5.0|I enjoyed the movie as it was a good rendering of the book. I am looking forward to the next movie now.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Wonderful storytelling, realistic characters. I loved the book.<br />It's a bit like being in the surroundings of a midsomer murder plot.
B00AWBYA2G|5.0|A friend introduced me to Across The Universe recently, and I was completely captivated by it. I can't believe I missed seeing at the theater, but I'm glad I finally saw it. If you love early Beatles music, and anything from the 1960s, you'll enjoy this love story. Well acted, well-written, and filled with emotion and symbolism, this is one feel-good movie you don't want to miss. It took me right back to my childhood when I would sit in my room and listen to those wonderful Beatles tunes on my record player. This film brings back images from the turbulent 1960s as well, and a time in which many American boys were being drafted and sent to Vietnam to fight a war they had no interest in either winning or fighting. The film captures some of the angst these young people went through trying to reconcile their beliefs in the cost of freedom. Do I fight in an unjust war because my country tells me to, or do I escape to Canada where I have no hope of returning to American soil as a free citizen?<br /><br />A beautiful love story unfolds between a young woman whose own brother is drafted and sent away, and her love for a British-born young man from Liverpool and his own search for his father in the United States.<br /><br />I can wholeheartedly recommend Across The Universe as good entertainment.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I chose this book because I had saw the movie when I was little.  I liked the book but I didn't liked how the tiny man be came tiny. But otherwise I loved the book.<br /><br />  Sincerely your fan Erika Stenzel
1781162646|4.0|Reading Stephen King is like putting on your old comfortable sweat pants. It just works, it's easy, and he writes conversationally as if you were talking it through. Joyland is written in the same easy manner and it's easy to roll into the book.<br /><br />I've read just about every King book (and some of his son's as well) and found Joyland to be good but not great. I know that may not be the popular opinion and I'm not saying that it wasn't good but it just fell a little short in relation to his other stories. It was often slow and never really reached the altitude that he usually accomplishes.<br /><br />So while I enjoyed Joyland, I wouldn't put it on my 'favorites' bookshelf.
B00D4FDNIO|5.0|I can't stop listening to this album. I never knew house music this good would be relevant, but it sure is. This sounds even better than the stuff I used to listen to in the 90s going to raves as a teenager. The vocals are amazing as well. Album of the year in my opinion.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game. I like to play this game all the time because it is alot of fun. I would like to buy the ninja on subway surfers.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I'm not sure how I discovered Lauren Oliver, but am so glad I did. I find her writing intriguing and can't wait to start book two of this trilogy. It is a fascinating!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This is a great film, based on the Bourne books.  It is not, however, just another Jason Bourne movie.  It takes place at the same time as Bourne Ultimatum, but with different characters in different scenarios.  Jeremy Renner is great as Aaron Cross, an agent of Outcome, a group of people enhanced with biodrugs.  They are, as stated, Treadstone without the inconsistencies (but with emotional issues such as hoarding and paranoia). All in all a great film I have watched 6 times.  Try watching all four in a row and you will be wowed out of your seat!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I enjoy this game so much.  I only wish I could go further without having to pay to play more levels.  It's a great game.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Official Tissue. It holds me down on my long commute to and from work. I like it. And it's free.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I now wish I had seem it in 3d. It is one of the most visually stunning movies I've seen in a long time. Franco is the man as well.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was hooked from the first paragraph. Great author. Another best seller by Khaled Hosseini. Heart wrenching and tear jerking stories.

B0042TV4IW|4.0|Liked this one from the first episode.  Interesting characters, good stories and familiar actors from other shows such as Downton Abbey, Whitechapel, Zen, Mr Selfridge, etc.  Looking forward to the other seasons.

B005544TRQ|2.0|I would have enjoyed the show, but the foul language was too much, especially the GD's.<br />After watching about three or four espisodes, I had to quit.
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|This \\"movie\\" deserves a rating of less than 1 star, but I cannot give it negative stars.  Think of it as a black hole.  It used to be a star, but now it just sucks in everything within reach and kills it by stretching it out into an infinity of atoms one after the other.<br /><br />But even this concept, a one atom deep reality, gives it a bit too much gravity.  It expresses ideas, but poorly.  It staggers from place to place as if it is some sort of drunk lout.  It keels over backwards, passed out and then urinates upon itself.<br /><br />This excrescence is the sort of movie one might have expected to emerge from the propaganda bureau of a police state government.  However, that said, it would not come from a sophisticated police state.  No, it could only be the result of a police state run by those sorts of policemen who bash in the heads of children in front of television cameras or who participate in murders and rapes and record it all on their phone so they can show their friends.<br /><br />And yet, it is none of these things.  It is a movie made by persons ostensibly hoping to make money and build/continue a career.<br /><br />Truly, sometimes fiction is stranger than truth.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|inthink it is a great game hard if you like hard games this is the one for you so go get this game
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|After a hard week at work, t,his was a nice, light adventure movie to settle down to on Friday night!
B00005JNEI|4.0|If you like Michael Moore's documentaries (and I do) then you will find Fahrenheit a good entry.  Those who don't agree with his left of center politics won't enjoy it at all!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a great game, especially considering it was free!! I like that my kids can sit with me and play along and help me!
B0087ZG7UW|5.0|I purchased the DVD because I always enjoy seeing the movie on TV and wanted a copy I could view at my leisure.  The film is still a classic and the acting is first rate.  It may be a little dated but it is still enjoyable.
B000J103YI|5.0|I love the movie and the soundtrack.  I purchased both from amazon.  The cd came early and I was thrilled because I wanted the soundtrack for my car.  It was packaged securely and it was a great price.  Thanks :-)
B00BWRKVVS|4.0|Walt Disney Home Entertainment is on a roll with the Blu-ray releases of three of the greatest animated features from the early 2000s on Blu-ray. They unloaded \\"Lilo & Stitch,\\" \\"Atlantis: The Lost Empire,\\" and \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" on the same day for the first time in high definition. If that's not reason to celebrate for fans of the Mouse House, I don't know what is.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" 2 Movie Collection 3-Disc Special Edition includes \\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" and \\"Kronk's New Groove.\\" Both films are together on one Blu-ray, while they each get their own regular format DVD.<br /><br />Kuzco is the selfish emperor of the large Incan kingdom. His scheming advisor, Yzma, turns the self-absorbed king into a llama to gain control of his throne and become its new ruler. The transformed Kuzco awakens to find himself banished from his royal city. He must join forces with a villager named Pacha to regain his leadership and find a cure that will turn him back into the man he once was.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is one of my favorite Disney animated movies. It features an all-star voice cast including David Spade, John Goodman, Patrick Warburton, and the late Eartha Kitt. Each one of these actors gives their characters depth and successfully brings them to life. This launched enough audience interest to convince Disney to make a direct-to-DVD sequel and a television show.<br /><br />There's some great humor found in \\"The Emperor's New Groove.\\" Of course, we get David Spade's sarcasm and wit. Patrick Warburton keeps audiences laughing in delight as he plays the \\"no brains - all brawn\\" henchman of Yzma named Kronk. It also helps that the movie isn't a musical. There's some musical numbers, but the character's don't stop dead in their tracks and start bellowing out a song every five minutes like many of the classic Disney films.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" is a great tool to help teach children the importance of thinking about how your actions affect others. It also shows how selfishness can cloud your judgment and hurt people. Disney continues to find entertaining ways to tell a tale of morality and be enjoyable at the same time.<br /><br />\\"Kronk's New Groove\\" is the direct-to-DVD sequel and obviously concentrates on Yzma's dim-witted henchman. When Kronk finds out his demanding father is coming for a visit, he becomes concerned that his new life as the chef of his own restaurant won't be enough to please him. The devious Yzma uses his insecurities to her advantage and lures Kronk to assist her in an evil \\"get-rich-quick\\" scheme. After realizing the consequences of his actions, the loveable lunkhead must find a way to fix all the damage he's caused to his friends.<br /><br />The Emperor Kuzco shows up briefly to provide commentary for \\"Kronk's New Groove.\\" However, that's all we see of him. This is a delightfully funny sequel to the first film and teaches children the importance of being honest and thinking about the consequences of your actions before doing something.<br /><br />As far as audio and video quality is concerned, both films look and sound better than they ever have before. Both are presented with 1080p High Definition with 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. The picture is vibrant and the sound effects and musical scores will delight viewers. I didn't notice any real drastic changes in the quality of animation like you get with most of these direct-to-DVD movies.<br /><br />Just like the \\"Atlantis\\" Blu-ray release, the special features for the two movies are only found on the regular format DVDs. This will no doubt frustrate many consumers who buy these new Blu-ray editions with the idea that they'll get everything on one disc. There's a \\"Making of\\" featurette, deleted scenes, music videos by Sting and Rascall Flatts, and audio commentary for the first film. The Rascall Flatts' video is instructional and teaches kids how to \\"Walk the Llama Llama.\\" \\"Kronk's New Groove\\" includes a \\"Behind-the-Scenes\\" featurette and two games.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" 2 Movie Collection 3-Disc Special Edition provides a great way to get both of these movies on one Blu-ray. Having to switch out discs to watch the special features might be a little inconvenient for those who want to watch them. Overall, having these two delightful films in one package will save you space in your ever-growing Disney home entertainment library.the-Scenes\\" featurette and two games.<br /><br />\\"The Emperor's New Groove\\" 2 Movie Collection 3-Disc Special Edition provides a great way to get both of these movies on one Blu-ray.

B00866H7SS|2.0|I  don´t  really  like  it,  exactly  like  50  shades, I thought  the  author  should  look  for  a  different plot, and  situations,.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I'll admit that I didn't have the highest of expectations for this, but it was an enjoyable movie. Family friendly, a slightly different take on the classic Jack and the Beanstalk tale.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down... read it in one day! You will not regret buying this book!
B00000255F|5.0|Simply the best rock album of all time. If came the U.F.O. and asked us: what is rock music? I'll give them a copy of this album!
0062278592|5.0|This was my first Neil Gaiman read. It will not be the last.<br /><br />It grabbed me from the first two pages. This story took me through the gamut of emotions and I would have to say this is what I enjoyed most about reading the book. I kept thinking I knew where the story would go and it would go somewhere else entirely. I thought I knew things about the characters that I figured out and I kept being surprised. The Hempstock's were a very interesting family and they got even more interesting as the story went on. Much of what happened in this story was fantasy, but I kept thinking that some of this was or could be real.<br /><br />I found myself getting happy, getting surprised, getting scared & even getting angry.  I got so mad at one point when Ursala had taken over the main characters father and made him do terrible things. I was so mad, I decided I wasn't going to read it anymore. Then, a minute went by and I thought, I have to see where this is going. Luckily, I kept reading and I was taken through the story. The story concept, the way Neil ties it all in and sums it up in the end was really quite amazing and it had a good ending, or did it?!!<br /><br />I think different readers will see it differently honestly.<br /><br />I read several reviews and most reviewers give a synopsis so I won't do this again and tell the story. But I will say that from the minute I picked it up, I was locked in.<br /><br />I recommend this to all fantasy readers. I'm not even a big fantasy reader or should I say I wasn't.<br /><br />Thanks Neil for one hell of read.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Really REALLY good read.  Can't wait to read another story from the author.  The story really sucked me in from the begining.

B00866H7SS|5.0|Wow, could not put it down once I started reading. The follow up was down loaded in no time and that also did not disappoint.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Norah Jones is wonderful in this album. Her musicality and songs are just superb. Her unique voice makes this album one of my favorite.
B00D3ZJB1S|5.0|This Best Buy Deluxe version is the definitive version to get, as it includes two CDs with a total of twelve tracks, whereas the non-deluxe version only has eight. There is also a pretty cool T-shirt sporting the \\"13\\" logo and is a must have for the die hard Sabbath fan. Best Buy offers all of this packaged and available for $29.99 plus tax. In comparing this Best Buy Deluxe version, with twelve songs, to the other Deluxe release, which has 11 songs, there is only one bonus track difference but it's \\"the\\" bonus track to have and you'll kick yourself for not getting the version with \\"Naivete in Black\\". I ordered online and picked up the CDs at my local Best Buy on the same day.<br /><br />Now, regarding the music, this album features the classic Sabbath lineup, with the exception of Brad Wilk sitting in for Bill Ward on drums. Wilk has paid his dues with such bands as \\"Rage Against the Machine\\" and \\"Audioslave\\" and \\"Black Sabbath 13\\" rocks as a result. The album will kick your a** and, moreover, transport you back to the early days of Sabbath. In my opinion, this album could be the second cousin once removed relative to \\"Master Of Reality\\" and there are also nods to \\"Black Sabbath\\" and \\"Paranoid\\". This is, in no small part, due to Brad Wilk, who has done an amazing job of staying true to the Bill Ward style of drumming.<br /><br />Ozzy is singing in a lower register on most of the songs but his voice is spot on and, as is his nature, his vocals go with the flow of the signature Iommi riffs and Butler bass lines. Again, to me, the songs are highly reminiscent of the band's early albums and it's wonderfully weird to be reminded of the early 70's, which was when these guys invented this style of music. Of course, the band consciously sought to go back in time and write songs from that era, including a track entitled \\"Zeitgeist\\" (spirit of the time) in the style of \\"Planet Caravan\\", which eerily contributes to this \\"Sequel of Reality\\".<br /><br />\\"Black Sabbath 13\\" is not what I would call a commercial album by any stretch of the imagination so you won't find any catchy little songs like \\"Paranoid\\". In fact, most of the songs subscribe to a much slower to moderate tempo and average well over seven minutes, with the exception of the bonus track, \\"Naivete in Black\\", which is a shorter balls-to-the-wall rocker. Overall, it's a very heavy album regardless of the tempos and you're sure to hear references to other Sabbath albums on future playings of this one. It's time to get your Sabbath on and you'll receive a better value with what is offered exclusively by Best Buy. Geez, now I have a craving for \\"Sweetleaf\\" - the song, not the smoke. :-)t what I would call a commercial album by any stretch of the imagination so you won't find any catchy little songs like \\"Paranoid\\".

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amzing i so many levels . Also Mojang upgraed cretive .Also theres more stuff to make . Also theres caves in minecraft pe
B003Z49LYO|4.0|I thought this was a good interpretation of the original novel,. The characters were well-cast, and it didn't rush through the plot with the number of episodes it has.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I can not wait for the next game. Really cool puzzles. Sad that I completed it already.  If you like puzzles you will love this game.
1250012570|5.0|Young adult romance is not the sort of book that I normally read.  If I do venture into the young adult genre, it is usually something along the lines of The Hunger Games or such.  However, I had heard so many wonderful things about Eleanor and Park that I had to give it a try.<br /><br />That being said, I was a little apprehensive because hype doesn't always work out for me.  Thankfully (oh so thankfully!), this was a book that lived up to the hype.<br /><br />There are a lot of things going for this book for me.  For one thing, this book is set in my time.  As far as I can tell, Eleanor and Park--if they were flesh-and-bone beings--would only be a year older than I am.  I'm a sucker of nostalgia and this book brought a lot of that for me.<br /><br />Secondly, Eleanor and Park does romance the right way--the real way.  I don't think their relationship is unconventional at all--although I wish that Eleanor's living situation was.  This isn't a hallmark card love story.  The best I can describe it is that it is a couple steps past a John Hughes movie (again, I think I just dated myself).<br /><br />The dual narrator format can be difficult, both to write and read.  In Eleanor and Park, it is what makes the book work.  Readers experience the turmoil of emotions inside both of the main characters as they try to figure out their feelings for each other and for themselves.<br /><br />Don't let the \\"Young Adult\\" label turn you off this book.  It may be about two teenagers, but it is a timeless story.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|Really a surprisingly funny and wellwritten book about the challenges of love and social interaction. A tribute to science and love.
B000VWGYHU|4.0|[[ASIN:B000VWGYHU The Marshall Mathers LP Explicit]]  this is the link you saw, i love the music and quite sure you will to. Lots of explicit language but good.  my opinion is that its quite good.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Wow, hate that I'm done, wanted the book to keep going! action packed, like the new characters, and on sad note, was in tears on two loses! saw it coming, but hated when it did happen! yes I was in tears, loved the characters! As always, James Rollins keeps you on the edge of your seat, and had my pulse racing, and your cheering for the characters, and crying for the characters! If you love action and adventure, this is the book for you!!  Now hoping for the next book! enjoy all!!!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|O.K. first off... I am not a musical genius. I can not and will not give you a track by track critique of this soundtrack. what I can say to you is I have Listened to Hans Zimmer for many years and this is just another incredible notch under his musical belt! I also own the John Williams Soundtrack for the 1978 Superman. Beautiful! They both are perfect music for there own time period!! Please do not try to judge them against each other. They Both are Brilliant!!
B006QLH7O4|5.0|Great movie even better in 3D. In 3D the movie had me on the edge of my seat. I found it very entertaining!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much. Actually found it hard to put down. Looking forward to reading the next book and more to be written.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|Just couldn't get into this one. Story was difficult to follow and didn't care for the black and white filming style.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This was my entry into the Dr Who series, and I must say the show is incredible. It is intelligent, witty, really funny. Rose and the Doctor start to feel like friends, and I am left in awe of their adventures. I highly recommend this show, it is worth all the hype it is given.
B00C1N9JWO|3.0|After getting enthralled in this series, I could barely wait for the next book. One of the strongest things the series had going was characters you fell in love with and could continue to follow through their lives as the storyline progressed. After all the buildup between the Psy/Changeling/Humans, the coming war, the status of the Psynet, the new changeling packs, the characters lives...this book left me terribly disappointed. Not one storyline was truly tied up. We were left with more questions than answers. And if the big surprise was the identity of The Ghost? It was sadly lacking. I could not be more disappointed and will not be purchasing another book by this author. If she ran out of idea's on how to end the series, she should have held off or handed it off to another writer. Frankly, her readers deserved better.
0205313426|3.0|I would have preferred the grammar rules included rather than simply the correct way to write or use the correct gramar.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Great story line and a great look into History. Outstanding performance by the actors. This is a very educational and enjoyable series.
0143121316|5.0|As a Chinese woman who went through Mao's Cultural Revolution, I totally agree with the views of Dr. Kissinger.  The book is written by someone who understands China but with America's interest in heart!  Make sure buy the paperback with a new afterword.  It is so very helpful to understand a country so vast with 4,000 years of history.  Kissinger is not naive, not at all; he is a very skilled (almost shrewd) politician.  Mao is a man with many sides.  He was narrow and cruel on one side but a great visionary on the other.  That is why he shook hands with his enemy, America, when he thought necessary.  We, people of the world, need such visionaries (Nixon, Zhou, Deng, and Kissinger).  It is time for America to open its mind and heart to the world.
B007SGM084|5.0|loved it... steamy and a great read. read it all back to back in about a week. didn't want to put it down!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This app really makes you think. Each level is increasingly more difficult than the one before.  It really makes you think outside of the box.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|THE MOVIE HAS IT ALL HERO..VILLIAN..LOVE STORY..FANTASY....ALL WRAPPED UP IN ONE NEAT PACKAGE..AN THOR...OMG WHAT A HUNKA HUNKA MAN..LOVE IT
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters is a fun action movie if you don't mind predictable storytelling, bad pacing and cartoonish gore. We are apparently all just water balloons filled with blood waiting to pop at the slightest bump. This film is clearly geared for the early teen boy crowd, so if you go in with that mentality, you'll probably enjoy the film.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Great album, but a little bit &#34;poppy&#34; for some peoples taste.  Listen to it all the time and need to put some more words . . .
B006M4F67A|5.0|Great fun, enjoyable, challenging, concentration, eye coordination & mind control.  Take your time, be sure & let your eyes travel around the board.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I can set multiple alarms for multiple days at multiple times I have 15 different alarms and I canxstill put more in some ways its better than a digital alarm clock!
B005DJREJS|5.0|I always watch a show when I work out, and it's generally dark, heavy, stressful Sci-Fi. I wanted something more lighthearted for now and this was recommended by Amazon. I love it. even thought it's a high school-oriented show, the content is realistic without being stupid and dramatic. The main character is smart & interesting, and it's got moments that are hysterical. Most of all, it keeps my attention for the entire episode. Good stuff.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This was a fun game.  Too bad there are only ten levels.  Definitely left me wanting more levels.  They said more levels are coming.  Hope it is soon.  Puzzles are challenging but not to the point of frustration.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This book will literally blow your mind if you are politically aware. Even if your not, I couldn't put it down, this is a book I will be buying a beautiful hard copy of. Hope the movie does it justice.
1781162646|5.0|The Master at his best,I would recommend this book to all readers.I'm older I wish the print was a little larger,but by far a great summer read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is better then the horse games ive played for systems! great game you should get it, it will provide you with lots of fun!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Great cast, fun / light-hearted story line, very entertaining. Good soundtack, too. I love Anna Kendrick - she selects good roles.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Can you escape is a very mind boggling game it took me a couple tries but it was fun. Every time I finished I had a whole new level.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I liked the book, and the perspective. Having a husband who formerly raced motorcycles, I knew a lot of the terminology and strategy of racing, which helped.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game was super fun. I love how you get to do all things you really do with a real horse.
0143117009|5.0|This book is amazing.  I can't believe the negative reviews.  This is one of the most informative well written/ researched books I've ever read.  You can not like the conclusions drawn- like why the Mayan empire collapsed- but they are exhaustively backed up and rationally explained.  5 Stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a really cool game! And also fun! Like really fun!I'm glad I have this game at.least it didn't cost money:)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is awesome. Both easy and hard puzzles.  Story lines is engaging and well done. Graphics are cool. I won't play with sound so can't comment.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an amazing app that helped me in so many ways! Like great ideas when your mine is blank I love it!
B003Y5H574|4.0|I can't think of anything about this movie I don't love.  All the actors are great and I love the fact that Josh Groban is in it.  I even loved the weird love Robbie had for his babysitter.  Also, one thing I love about watching films is being able to quote them later and this film is definitely quotable.
B00536OCYG|5.0|If you are a Pink Floyd lover, this is an album to own and listen to often. It is truly a masterpiece! I never get tired to listening to it because it so well made and lyrics are so well written that, in my opinion, it will never get old no matter how often you listen to it. It is truly a timeless piece!<br /><br />I recommend to anybody who appreciate an artistic musical piece!
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|I think this movie is underrated.  I know it was in theatres, which is more than most indie films can say, but I still don't think it gets the recognition it deserves.  It has some of the best actors, in my opinion, including Chloe Grace Moretz - whom I absolutely love.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A VERY CHALLENGING GAME FOR SURE. I HAD TO  LEAVE THE ROOM A FEW TIMES TO GET MY MIND GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. TAKE IT FROM ME, YOU WILL FIND THE ANSWER IF YOU NEVER GAVE UP.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Hate movies like this. But this was a great movie to watch. No wonder it was an academy award winner.
B005LHO274|5.0|Then this app will be an ideal addition to your collection.<br />Plenty of useful features and up to date information.
B001NA6096|5.0|I really did not expect too much and would not have even bothered if someone had not recommended it to me.  After all, the description of two people walking and talking did not inspire too much anticipation.  However, the two people are charming and delightful, the cinematography and views of Vienna, wonderful and the conversation insightful.  Within the span of about 12 hours, the viewer is privileged to follow the formation of a relationship between two people which is totally believable and form insights into the individual characters.  Beautifully done and I  would highly recommend this movie!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A perfect game for a mobile device. Clever puzzles, stellar graphics and decent sound makes this a game to remember. Although a little short, i didnt put my tablet down till i finished it. Cant wait for more rooms!!!
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Love connect games and this is good one. Have played 20 levels so far and its relaxing but keeps you thinking. Would be great voice for elementary age first connect game experience.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|Why can't they put this music on the radio it's all you will ever need to bump to whether it is at the gym or in your car. In short it is an awesome free music app, just get it
B005I4JG80|5.0|It was easy to read, fun and really helpful. Ideas and points of view that have been left aside here in America
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Watched this with my daughters, granddaughter and grandson. Some of them read the books.  All the family is waiting for the next one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just read it. And then re read it. Totally worth it.<br />I just wish I knew more. I want more!!
