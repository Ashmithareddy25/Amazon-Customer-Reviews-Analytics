B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have bought over 200 books on Amazon but this is only my 3rd review.  This series is brilliantly written - I highly recommend.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|super fun so far!  easy to earn acorns, having a hard time connecting with nieghbors though,  that's kinda  frustrating!!  but other wise lots of fun :)
B00785P2QC|5.0|I thought I wouldn't like he game but as I started to get the hang of it I couldn't stop playing I love this game very well put together.
0345803485|1.0|Okay.  I am embarrassed that I wasted my time reading all three books in this series in a vain attempt to understand why the author of this disaster is receiving so much attention.  There are so many talented authors out there.<br /><br />And I tried, I really tried.<br /><br />This series is nothing more than a cheap Twilight rip-off.  Brooding, copper-haired, good-looking, wealthy Christian is about as close to Edward as you could get without the whole being a vampire aspect.  And boring, inexperienced, plain, lip-biting Anastasia -- Bella, anyone?  And seriously?  Set in Washington State??  Stephanie Meyers should sue.<br /><br />The characters are under-developed and the writing is completely sophmoric.  The two main characters spend all of their time e-mailing each other, \\"clambering\\" into and onto things, and gasping.<br /><br />And do not get me started on Ana's \\"inner goddess.\\"  ARE YOU KIDDING WITH THIS CRAP??<br /><br />What might be interesting is a book written from the perspective of the staff of these two one-dimensional idiots.  You know, an account of how annoyed Taylor must be having to babysit Anastasia all the time while simultaneously listening to Christian's temper tantrums and how Mrs. Jones is really pissed off about having to clean dirty \\"playroom\\" toys for a living.<br /><br />What's worse is that women are reading this series and secretly resenting the men in their life for being average men.  When their guys come home from their regular, 9 to 5 jobs and plop down in the recliner to watch a little CNN before dinner (meatloaf again--a little burnt), their wives are all biting their lips and wondering where they can find a hot, athletic, copper-haired, 26-year-old genius millionaire to give them a spanking.<br /><br />What a waste.
0670022950|4.0|This is not a perfect book, but it is unique, and if you skim the first 400 or so pages, the last 300 are a pretty good attempt to apply what's known about behavior to social changes in violence and manners over time. The basic topic is: how does our genetics control and limit social change? Surprisingly he fails to give in any clear way the explanation for this in terms of inclusive fitness which is entailed by neodarwinism  Mostly the criticisms given by others (I read them all) are nit-picking and irrelevant and, as Pinker has said, he could not write a coherent book about \\"bad things\\", nor could he give every possible reference and point of view, but he should have said at least something about the other ways of abusing and exploiting people and the planet since these are now so much more severe as to render other forms of violence irrelevant.<br /><br />Extending the concept of violence will provide a very different perspective on what is happening in the world right now and how things are likely to go in the next few hundred years. One might start by noting that the decrease in physical violence over history has been matched (and made possible) by the constantly increasing merciless rape of the planet (i.e., by people's destruction of their own descendants future). Pinker (like most people most of the time) is often distracted by the superficialities of culture when its biology that matters.<br /><br />This is the classic nature/nurture issue and nature trumps nurture --infinitely. What really matters is the violence done to the earth by the relentless increase in population and resource destruction (due to medicine and technology) About 200,000 more people a day (another Los Angeles every three weeks), the 12 tons or so of topsoil going into the sea/person/year etc. mean that unless some miracle happens the biosphere and civilization will largely collapse in this century and there will be starvation, misery and violence of every kind on a staggering scale. People's manners, opinions and tendencies to commit violent acts are of no relevance unless they can do something to avoid this catastrophe, and I don't see how that is going to happen. There is no space for arguments, and probably no point either (yes I'm fatalist), so I'll just make a few comments as though they were facts. Don't imagine I have a personal stake. I am 71, have no descendants and no close relatives and do not identify with any political, national or religious group and regard the ones I belong to by default as just as repulsive as all the rest.<br /><br />Parents are all Enemies of Life on Earth and women are at least as violent as men. The fact that women's violence (like most of that done by men) is largely done in slow motion, at a distance in time and space and mostly carried out by proxy -by their descendants and by men --does not ameliorate it. Increasingly women bear children regardless of whether they have a mate and the effect of stopping one woman from breeding is on average much greater than stopping one man. In my view most people and their offspring richly deserve whatever misery comes their way and (with rare exceptions) the rich and famous are the worst offenders. Meryl Streep or Bill Gates and each of their kids may destroy 50 tons of topsoil each per year, while an Indian farmer may destroy 1 ton. If you deny it or don't want to deal with it that's fine, and to your descendants I say \\"Welcome to Hell on Earth\\"(WTHOE).<br /><br />Human Responsibilities must replace Human Rights. Nobody gets rights without being a responsible citizen and the first thing this means is minimal environmental destruction . The most basic responsibility is no children unless your society asks you to produce them. A society or a world that lets people breed at will and supports their progeny will always be exploited by selfish genes until it collapses (or reaches a point where life is so horrific it's not worth living). If you want to maintain Human Rights asprimary, that's fine and to your descendants one can say with confidence \\"WTHOE\\".<br /><br />\\"Helping\\" has to be seen from a global long term perspective. Almost all \\"help\\" that's given by individuals, organizations or countries harms others and the world in the long run and must only be given after a very careful consideration. If you want to hand out money, food, medicine, etc., you need to ask what the long term environmental consequences are. If you want to please everyone all the time, that's fine and again to your descendants I say \\"WTHOE\\".<br /><br />Dysgenics: endless trillions of creatures beginning with bacteria-like forms over 3 billion years ago have died to create us and all current life and this is called eugenics. We all have \\"bad genes\\" but some are worse than others. It is estimated that up to 50% of all human conceptions end in spontaneous abortion due to \\"bad genes\\". Civilization is dysgenic. This problem is currently trivial compared to overpopulation but getting worse by the day. Medicine, welfare and \\"helping\\" of all kinds have dysgenic consequences which will collapse society even if population growth stops. Again if you don't believe it or don't want to deal with it that's fine and to your descendants we can say \\" WTHOE\\".<br /><br />Beware the utopian scenarios that suggest doomsday can be avoided by judicious application of technologies. You can't fool mother nature. I leave you with just one example. Famous scientist Raymond Kurzweil proposed nanobots as the saviors of humankind. They would make anything we needed and clean every mess. They would even make ever better versions of themselves. They would keep us as pets. But think of how many people treat their pets, and pets are overpopulating and destroying and becoming dysgenic almost as fast as humans. Pets only exist because we destroy the earth to feed them and we have spay and neuter clinics and euthanize the sick and unwanted ones. We practice rigorous population control and eugenics on them and no form of life can evolve or exist without these--not even bots. And what's to stop nanobots from evolving? Any change that facilitated reproduction would automatically be selected for and any behavior that wasted time or energy (i.e., taking care of humans) would be heavily selected against. What would stop the bots program from mutating into a homicidal form and exploiting all earth's resources causing global collapse? There is no free lunch for bots either and to them too we can confidently say \\"WTHOE\\".primary, that's fine and to your descendants one can say with confidence \\"WTHOE\\".<br /><br />\\"Helping\\" has to be seen from a global long term perspective.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love this game!! fun for people that can and can't draw! just wish it didn't take so many coins to get new Colorado. is hard to find people that will play.
B0040Z9H5K|5.0|Iron Man 2 was still a amazing movie but i cant put my finger on it, it just wasnt as good but still just as good you know what i mean? Im still giving this 5 stars although the only problem i had with this movie was the bad guy and Hammar who after awhile just got on my nerves to see.
1595825045|5.0|This is an amazing work of art!<br /><br />My foray into the Airbender saga began when I read an article about the 10 best episodes in the series. The moment I saw these, I was hooked and had to see every episode across all the seasons! The variety of costumes and design and styles definitely captured my imagination!<br /><br />This book is a perfect companion to the animated series in that it explores the various design elements that were explored as part of the series and how the design evolved from one season to another.<br /><br />Especially interesting is the commentary (wish there were more) on how the style was developed and the various inspirations for the design (wish there was more details on the process of creating all the characters but this would have made the book enormous)<br /><br />A definite must have for fans of the series or art enthusiasts.
1455844195|2.0|I loved this book!  I read it in a day and couldn't put it down!  As a middle school teacher, I immediately wanted to use it with my students, so I purchased the audio version.<br /><br />I have purchased other audio books for both personal and professional use.  When multiple discs have been involved (This set has seven.), they have always come in some type of hard case to keep the discs protected.  I have had many even come in a binder type case with soft, protective sleeves for each disc.  This set came in a flimsy cardboard box.  Each disc is in a simple paper sleeve, like you'd purchase in the store to burn your own discs.  This really disappointed me as I'm concerned on how well protected these will be during use and storage considering how often I will be using them.<br /><br />The other disappointment was that the tracks are not labeled on each disc.  There is no list printed on the box, or as an insert inside.  The disc does not even say how many tracks are on it, let only which chapter belongs to each disc.  Sometimes the chapters and tracks match up, one chapter per track, but longer chapters are split between multiple tracks.  If you're just putting this in your car for a long ride, not a big deal, but if you want to follow along with the book, it is a challenge.  I have had to listen to the first few seconds of each track to match it to the book and create my own table of contents for each disc.  Assuming many teachers and parents would want to use the audio version with their students and children, this is not very convenient.<br /><br />As I said, the story is wonderful and the audio quality is fine.  But considering I paid $18.00, (regular retail $25.00) I would have expected a bit more to the product.  For what I got, I could have recorded myself reading the book and saved a lot of money!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I got this and beat it a day. It was really fun, but I expected more levels. I noticed that for the original angry birds in he doesn't have all the worlds. I hope it wont be like that for this. Over all it's great.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was rather looking forward to reading this book.  I enjoy a good book that also has some steamy sex (Linda Howard is one author).  I am no prude.  However, this is about S and M, which is just too freaky, and the story itself is redundant and boring.  I found myself skipping the sex scenes, because it was just more of the same.  The best written part of the book was the witty e mails sent back and forth.  Ana is always in angst, always questioning him, and his character is just unreal.  More plot!!  I have no interest in reading the next books.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i love the game but i have lots of problems seeing friends islands. i have done everything costomer service has told me to and still have the problem, leading me to believe it is not something i am doing wronge.
B002UTKSBK|5.0|Playing this CD in the background will keep you in Middle Earth. Howard Shore has written a great score whose melodies are ethereal and haunting.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I thought the movie was great. Yea the acting was not top notch, but using real Navy Seals made the action much better. It put a whole different perspective on war tactics and how they go about missions. The brotherhood of our soldiers is amazing, and i can watch this movie over and over (seen it 4 times in theatres already lol).
B007HO392S|2.0|Did not enjoy playing this album at all. Played it through 8 times but cannot find any tracks that I like. I am a huge Country Music and Pop Music fan going back 44 years. It seems that the USA does not have any outstanding country song writers any more,hey wait there must  be because Kellie P's cd was fantastic! Sent from the UK.
B000FC10MU|5.0|Before I truly get started on my review of American Gods by Neil Gaiman, I should mention a few things. First off, I was struck in awe and wonderment at being able to read the works of such a master wordsmith. Neil Gaiman is a craftsman when it comes to words. His prose, while not overly flowery, has a depth of emotion and poetry that is a joy to read.<br /><br />Secondly, I benefitted greatly from a website that compiled and explained the mythology behind various gods and characters. If you decide to read this book, may I highly recommend bookmarking and referencing \\"Only The Gods Are Real?\\" [...]<br /><br />Trust me when I say you will appreciate the way Gaiman weaves metaphor and mythology so much MORE when you understand the stories he's drawing from. The way he describes the gods and the situations he places them in is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />American Gods is a really large elephant of a book. It's been a few days since I've finished reading this novel, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around all of the various concepts and layers. When I focus on one aspect of the book, the others seem to fade out of reach in my mind.<br /><br />They're still there, but slightly out of view. Then, as I shift my attention to another angle of the story, the original thought recedes and goes out of focus. I realize that they're all connected and inter-related, but being able to explain precisely how it all fits is a challenge that seems beyond my scope and ability. In the end, I've been left with a sense of enormity and magnificence, while still not managing to see the whole beast at once.<br /><br />So, then, let's look at the components separately, instead.<br /><br />+++American Gods is a story about a man named Shadow Moon.+++<br /><br />Shadow Moon is a man who was sentenced to six years in jail and is due to be released early for good behavior after only serving three of them. A few days before he's to be freed, his life is shattered when he finds out that his wife has died in a car crash.<br /><br />On his way home, to attend his wife's funeral, he meets a man named Mr. Wednesday. Mr. Wednesday wants to hire him on as his bodyguard and all around errand boy. Originally, Shadow declines the offer, but Mr. Wednesday is insistent and eventually Shadow acquiesces- with a few stipulations.<br /><br />From the very beginning, Shadow can tell that things are not all as they seem. At first, he's reluctantly sucked into the events that unfold, but as things progress he becomes more willingly engaged. He comes to understand that there is a storm coming. There will be a great battle between old and new gods, and that Mr. Wednesday, who is really Odin in disguise, is at the heart of the events unfolding.<br /><br />Much like the skin of an elephant, this is perhaps the easiest aspect of the story to identify. It is roughened by age and elements and yet still manages to be intriguing and comforting. Even if all you wanted to do was read this book on the surface level, it would be an entertaining and pleasant read.<br /><br />+++American Gods is a story about the struggle between old and new.+++<br /><br />Odin is the greatest Norse God, otherwise known as the All-Father. Immigrants brought the old gods from all over the world to America in their hearts and minds. Gods have come from China, Greece, India, Ireland, Egypt, and anywhere there were people who prayed and kept faith in a higher being.<br /><br />Slaves, paupers, peasants all brought them oversea and across land on their backs and then tethered them within America's borders through sacrifice and worship. As the people who believed in them stopped believing, or teaching the new generations, or as they began to die off, the power of the old gods faded.<br /><br />The old gods were left to fend for themselves and take what little bit they could from the mythology and stories that remained. They had to resort to lying, cheating, whoring and preying on the people as best they could for their existence.<br /><br />Their diminished power made way for new gods. The gods of credit cards and freeways, television and computers, internet and media, modernization and progress.<br /><br />What the new gods have not realized (or maybe they suspect and fear it's truth) is that everything is impermanent and their very existence is still inherently based off the belief that people instill in them.<br /><br />As time moves forward, they will find themselves in a similar situation as the old gods. The lingo may be different, but the function is the same. The new gods fear that there isn't enough room in the people's hearts and minds for all of them, and so want to kill off the old gods.<br /><br />+++American Gods is a story about religion and the role of gods in our society.+++<br /><br />Gaiman delves into the roles that religion has played in all cultures around the world. At one point in the book, Mr. Wednesday says, \\"There's never been a true war that wasn't fought between two sets of people who were certain they were in the right.\\"<br /><br />How can anybody say this isn't relevant to today's geopolitical situation? With so much unrest in the Middle East and the blooming of the Arab Spring? With Iran rushing to gain nuclear capabilities and threatening to wipe Israel off the map; Israel threatening to train their weapons on Iran in retaliation. With the ethnic cleansing and genocide in Sudan and the Darfur?<br /><br />Hasn't it always been the same throughout our history? These are relatively recent examples, but at any point in mankind's past, there is a religion being used as an excuse to wage war and commit murder on masses of people who are different and equally- fervently- calling themselves \\"right.\\"<br /><br />Throughout humanity, gods have been thought of as, \\"a dream, a hope, a woman, an ironist, a father, a city, a house of many rooms...a celestial being whose only interest is to make sure your football team, army, business, or marriage thrives, prospers, and triumphs over all opposition.\\"<br /><br />The vehicle used to express the idea of God (or gods) is through religion. Religions are, by definition, a metaphor. They are a means to relate the story and concept. At one point in the book religion is described as an operating system.<br /><br />However, if you were to boil any religion down to its base, you'd be left with the concept that, in essence, gods are ideas. Ideas are more difficult to kill than people, it's true, but they can be killed and, therefore, it is possible to kill a god.<br /><br />+++American Gods is a story about the American identity.+++<br /><br />When Gaiman wrote this book, he'd been living in America for a few years and was trying to come to an understanding about our country's sense of identity. In his search, he takes the reader from Chicago to San Francisco to the smallest towns via back roads and kitschy tourist attractions. He addresses his findings and musing throughout the book and makes some very astute observations. Not exactly as a stranger, but not quite as an insider, either.<br /><br />At one point Mr. Wednesday mentions, \\"This is the only country in the world that worries about what it is.\\" Which, in my own limited experience, is exactly true. Throughout our history we've fretted over the influx of a particular demographic. Long ago, it was the Irish, then the Chinese. We've fought ourselves bloody over slavery and civil rights and interned our Japanese. A more modern example may be the laws recently passed in Arizona, primarily focusing on Hispanics.<br /><br />Each era, we have questioned ourselves and what it means to be American. The ones who have been here longer wrap themselves in the flag and gorge themselves on apple pie, all the while tucking away their own immigrant ancestors. The fact is, nobody is American. Not originally. And, that is entirely the point.<br /><br />One of the things I'm most proud of is my family heritage. My mom is caucasian. Blonde haired and blue eyed, her family has been in America since the 1700s and originated from England (I think there may be a bit of Irish and French in the mix, as well.) My maternal lineage could be considered one of the oldest families in America and has so many branches it's nearly impossible to keep track of them all.<br /><br />In contrast, my dad is full blooded Thai and first generation American. It was my grandparents who immigrated back in the 1940s in order to attend university and eventually make lives for themselves. I love the fact that I am a combination of some of the oldest Americans and newest Americans. I feel like I am the true embodiment of what it means to be American because of these two aspects. It's helped me to have a greater appreciation for our immigrant nature and realized that everybody who comes to this country has had a hand in shaping it's heritage AND it's future.<br /><br />I consider myself to be very patriotic. I still get a lump in my throat when I hear the national anthem hit that high note of hope and aspiration. I still marvel at the brilliance of the fireworks on the Fourth of July. And I insist on representing my country as best as I can when I go traveling abroad; choosing not to hide behind a Canadian flag simply because I'm afraid people will think less of me because of my country's reputation and propensity for war.<br /><br />However, that's not to say that I haven't been critical of our government and foreign policies. That doesn't mean that I haven't marched and protested and written multiple letters to Congress. I think a major part of the American identity is the fact that we DO have a tendency towards self-reflection; of constantly looking in the mirror and asking, \\"Who are we?\\"<br /><br />Despite our disparate pasts, cultures, languages and religions, how do we manage to make this country (that doesn't seem like it should work) function and persist? Even as we question our heritage, our language, our \\"American-ness\\" we have some undefined quality that makes us distinguishable from any other country.<br /><br />+++American Gods is a story about an elephant.+++<br /><br />Have you ever heard the story of the seven blind men in a room with an elephant? They are all asked to touch some part of the elephant and then to describe what it looks like.<br /><br />The first blind man touches the elephant's leg and says, \\"An elephant is like a pillar.\\"<br /><br />The second blind man touches the elephant's tail and says, \\"No, an elephant is like a snake.\\"<br /><br />A third blind man touches the elephant's trunk and says, \\"No, it's like a tree branch.\\"<br /><br />The fourth blind man touches the elephant's ear and says, \\"An elephant is like a hand fan.\\"<br /><br />And so on, down the line, each blind man grabs hold of a part of the elephant and declares what it is.<br /><br />In the end, they were all right, and yet...they were all wrong, as well. The fact was, the elephant was too large of a concept for any one man to grasp wholly. Some things are just larger than us and not meant to be fully understood.<br /><br />To fight over things we can't possibly know, such as what the exact parameters are in order to be defined as \\"American,\\" or over the will of God and the rules of higher beings, is an exercise in futility, ignorance and arrogance. Such is the impression I'm left with after reading American Gods by Neil Gaiman.<br /><br />+++Epilogue+++<br /><br />At the risk of mixing metaphors, or adding to this already bloated review, I'll leave you with one final quote from the book that I hope will help illuminate what I think is the essence of this book.<br /><br />\\"One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The way one describes a story, to oneself or the world, is by telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a dream. The more accurate the map, the more it resembles the territory.

0553801473|1.0|Only good point of this book , his writing skills are still sharp as ever.<br />Now bad points, I dont pay money to read about nothing happening. Plot doesnt go anywhere.<br />There is no character development or movement in the timeline.<br />Coming to violence , he must really have a dark and dreary mind if he cannot write a single chapter of hope, of unsullied dreams. I am tired of reading about his endless sufferings that the good guys have to suffer. By trying to make his bad guys so bad he is making them look like fools. & he is forgotten about the main threat from behind the Wall. There is no appearance of them in the entire novel.<br />I was compelled to write such a scathing review of him because he is a well-establised behaving like he can get away anything.<br />One star is because of the beautiful writing.
0312611692|5.0|Once you open this book, you will not be able to leave it. Ian Morris bombards you with information, not only from history and archaeology, but from a variety of auxiliary sciences, and although that makes for probably a slower reading, it also will keep you hooked in for more. The question he sets for himself is to explain why the Western civilizations of Western Europe and North America have led the world economically, culturally and militarily for the last 200 years, and not the Eastern civilizations of China and Japan; but he isn't happy with the explanations others have given. He constructs an index of social development to measure the advance of civilizations and evaluates the evolution of each region throughout history to arrive at answers as to why social development rises and falls, and rose so spectacularly since ca. 1800 in the West.<br /><br />Not all is successful. The huge rise in the 19th and 20th centuries of all of his index's parameters would have demanded that he split it in two; one pre- and one post- industrial, to better account for the peculiarities of both sides of the upturning curve during the Industrial Revolution. As it is, the graphic looks like a 90-degree turn from almost horizontal to almost vertical. It is a realistic view considering the enormous material growth of the last two centuries, but makes comparisons between the pre- and post- era hard to maintain. This is yet exacerbated by his usage of the same index towards the future. There really is no argument anywhere on why the slope should continue to be the same rate in the future.<br /><br />Another omission that I consider to be important is the almost complete neglect of South Asia. Morris does a very good job of summarizing Chinese and Japanese (for the East) and Middle Eastern and European (for the West) history, the pressures each faced, and the ways they raised (or not) their social development. The annexation of the Americas and Africa into the Western empires in the ageof 1500-1950 probably is good enough to justify their omissions. Yet it doesn't seem justifiable to me to omit South Asia in a book that aspires to explain great patterns of history that explain the rise, stagnation or fall of civilizations across each great cultural core in the world. South Asia is clearly independent of both a Sinic East and a Sumerian West, and although in contact with both since classical antiquity, it has never really integrated into either anymore than you could say Japan and the Asian Tigers have Westernized in the last few decades. If even in a global village era it makes sense to speak of West and East (which Morris assumes all the book, but by the end you get the impression he leaves this assumption unjustified and probably is himself not convinced of it), then it should make sense to speak of a \\"middle\\" South Asian core too.<br /><br />However, the real shortcoming of this book is in its extrapolations for the future. While all of them are presented as nothing more than possibilities, you still get the impression that, compared to the great erudition and analysis displayed before, they lack a lot of rigor. Morris has exposed by now, over and over, civilizations dominating their natural environment and modifying their social and economic organization once and again; sometimes giving rise to new heights of development, and sometimes falling victim to nature or to man-made crises. These falls, themselves, sometimes are short and sometimes last for centuries, and the climbing back itself takes several forms, depending on the experiences learned and the new opportunities available. Then he does not seem to try to apply the same to the future. He posits a future where his graphics would continue under the same tendencies, with the standard of living on both the North Atlantic rim and China steadily rising until by 2103 the East surpasses the West and becomes the most advanced civilization. Then he says he doesn't really believe this will happen, and advances a dichotomy between a Singularity future, where technology again breaks all the barriers previously set, advancing social development to heights we can't imagine today; and a Nightfall future, where nuclear war or environmental catastrophe reduce humankind to the stone age again, or even exterminate it. Now, there is no denying that either of these two futures should not be discounted, and should be considered possible. What should be questioned is that *only* these two futures are considered viable by Morris, with no kind of intermediate future. Everything he wrote previously regarding past collapses of empires and civilizations seems to apply again, and imply that a collapse, while possible, should not push humanity back into the stone age, but stall, maybe even reverse, some development, but only temporarily before the challenges were met by new people and civilizations discovering new ways to organize and meet the challenges thrown at them by nature and other humans. Conversely, everything about previous rises of social development indicates that ceilings are approached sometimes and that when this happens, it takes time before any civilization is capable of breaking them. There is nothing in history that predicts either Nightfall or Singularity, and everything to predict some intermediate future, and all the previous chapters stand as proof, which makes it all the more of a shortcoming. (In this context too, it ends up being more of a disappointment that he doesn't examine more regions. South Asia, again, seems like an obvious place to examine, but now again the Middle East, Africa, Southeast Asia and even Latin America could well be regions that discover new advantages of backwardness, surpass both the North Atlantic and the North Pacific, and solve the Gordian knot of Singularity or Nightfall, if indeed it were an unavoidable dichotomy with current ways of organization. It is also disappointing that, although he speculates about nuclear war, financial crises, nanotechnology, robotics, genetics, and clean energy, he only mentions in passing the demographic crises that most of the world is heading toward, including all the core East Asian countries and all of the core Western ones except the USA).<br /><br />That said, I still give it 5 stars, because it is a very well researched and written book, which as I said, will keep you hooked for more from start to finish. It also seems to me that Morris makes a plausible and well supported argument about the reasons why Western dominance since the 1750s happened, which is its main goal. It should spark debate both about its main issue of Western rise to global dominance, and about its speculations about the future, which should be a positive thing. This is a seminal book, which is sure to become a classic. Yet be aware of the shortcomings I mentioned too.
1905236042|5.0|These yoga cards were in perfect condition when I received them. They have been a great asset in my yoga classes, as each card is designed in a fun and funky manner, providing colourful drawings of yoga postures. Visuals are great for kids, and the descriptions on the back of the cards, break poses down so that children are more likely to attempt the poses. The only thing I would say is it would be good to have some sort of clip for the top lid of the box, as I can see it may eventually wear, and/or tear off.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book continues the story of Christian and Ana and this book is basically more of the same of books one and two.<br /><br />The best parts of \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" is when we get glimpses into why Christian is the way that he is as he finally opens up to Ana about his childhood but that's basically all that is different. Every thing is just a rehash of the what happened in the previous books, Ana bites her lip, she drives Christian mad with desire, gratuitous sex scene that's not really all that erotic. End scene with cuddling. Rinse and repeat.<br /><br />What was a welcome surprise is epilogue at the end, Fifty Shades of Christian, where we get to experience parts of his courtship of Ana through his eyes. This is where E.L. James actually shines as a writer and all it did was make me so disappointed that these books were not told via his point of view.<br /><br />If you've read the two previous books, you'll most likely enjoy this one since it follows the same formula. I gave this book 4 stars because it did hold my attention but is it the greatest story ever told or book I read? Absolutely not.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Please bare with me, this is my first book review. A little background first to help make this review a bit more understandable. I have never heard of the \\"Hunger Games\\" until February 2012 AND still didn't quite understand what it was all about. I know...clueless. My daughter gifted me for my Kindle \\"The Hunger Games\\". Brought me up to date quickly. Got me to pay attention to all the reviews and such on TV. She e-loaned me \\"Catching Fire\\" about mid-March. I wasn't done with the first book and only had two weeks on the e-loan. I was ecstatic! Many late nights, 3-4 am, late nights. Half way through \\"Catching Fire\\" I just had to have \\"Mockingjay\\". No matter how much it cost. Less than $10 Amazon Kindle e-book. YES! I finished \\"Mockingjay\\" in April, and it is now near end of May. Some of the minor details I can't recall right now, so again, bare with me. I give to you how I felt during and after reading the book. Suzanne Collins did a remarkable job bringing all the ends together. Every individual story came to closure. No loose ends. I do have to say, the first three chapters were a little dry/slow for me. Life right after the second round had me thinking...ya, so what....But as I said, everything came together. Not what the reader might have wanted or expected, but I will definitely read them again.

B005LAIGOQ|3.0|This poor boy will probably never fully breakaway from Harry Potter even though he's done fabulous theatre work. This movie had a decent story line, and was well acted by Radcliffe. However, this movie is filled with jump scares. It was a slow film, but I kept watching in hopes of getting a good ending. I think the ending was unexpected. Overall, I would rate this as a \\"Red-box Night\\" film and not a film to add to your collection unless you're a Radcliffe fan.

B007PFU4NQ|3.0|Two discs-42 minutes each approximately.  The booklet contains a short essay on Coltrane's life in music up to this album, and on through to his death.  Every Coltrane/jazz fan has heard this album, recorded in 1957.  Besides Coltrane, it features Lee Morgan-trumpet, Curtis Fuller-trombone, Paul Chambers-bass, Philly Joe Jones-drums, and Kenny Drew-piano.  You may feel the monaural version is worth less-for reasons listed below.  This set (especially in mono) is somewhere between 2-3 \\"stars\\", so approach accordingly.<br /><br />The stereo version is clean and punchy-without sounding harsh.  There's an open feel to the sound, being in stereo-but fans (like me) may also be interested in hearing a monaural version of this great album.  Overall the sound doesn't have the \\"open space\\" feeling as heard in the stereo version.  However there's a fullness, an evenness to the sound that's missing in stereo.<br /><br />In mono each instrument can still be heard easily.  The highs from Morgan's trumpet are a bit harsh sounding-as if the trumpet had reached the highest recording levels.  But when he stays out of the higher registers, the sound is fine.  The lows are full without sounding muddy.<br /><br />I'm assuming that the source for the mono album (if not both) is from a good vinyl source.  Listening without headphones I can't hear any horrible sonic anomalies-sometimes apparent when even a good vinyl copy is used as the source.  With headphones I detect some occasional slight anomalies-so if you're a true audiophile-you may want to pass this by.  I wish someone would release this in mono from a good source-maybe one day.<br /><br />So, if you're curious to hear this seminal album in mono, and/or want it for your Coltrane library, this is worth purchasing-as long as you understand that it's not anywhere near a perfect recording.  And the low price (as of this writing) makes it worth a listen-as long as you know what you're getting.

0345803485|1.0|I have never in my life reviewed a book. I believe that people have very different tastes and, who am I to tell them what to like? But 56% into this book, I decided I had to review it.<br /><br />I read the good and the bad reviews and I decided to give it a try. After all, it is a best seller and I enjoyed Harry Potter and The Hunger Games (and I am a 40-yr sold woman), which have both good an bad reviews, also. I am also not a reading snob. I enjoy a good story even if the writing is not up to par, and I have read anything from Austen to Fitzgerald to Coehlo to Rice.<br /><br />Two pages into the book, I realized that the author HAD to be a 16-year old girl. Her use of the expressions \\"Jeez\\", \\"Oh my\\", \\"holy cow\\", \\"crap\\" and the like, and the way she reasons with herself irritated me so much that I had to force myself to keep reading. It occurred to me that, being British,  the author watched movies like \\"Clueless\\" and \\"Mean Girls\\" and decided that all young Americans must speak like that, even newly graduated English Lit majors.<br /><br />The writing is very childish. She uses run on sentences and keeps describing him as \\"so hot\\" and then goes on to say he's \\"mercurial\\". She uses the words \\"down there\\" when referring to her clitoris, and keeps blushing and biting her lip.<br /><br />I have read erotica and enjoyed it, so I decided that the plot was nonexistent and that I would try to skip to the sex parts just for fun. Well that was also a disappointment. He descriptions are so sloppy that I had to go back in my reading to see if she was supposed to be standing or sitting or lying down. In addition, both characters have almost instant orgasms, making the sex scenes numerous but very brief. All he has to do is look at her with those grey eyes and she is having an orgasm. Fun for her, but not much for the readers.<br /><br />In all, the most entertaining part of this book were the reviews, finding that most readers agree with me. That brought a smile to my face andmade me blush, biting my lip. I am embarrassed to have spent $10 in this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutley love it. I am not one to just sit down and read, but this book changed that I cant put it down. It keeps me interested and wanted to find out what happens next. Would recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Not a bad book. It is very bums on seats. Don't get me wrong, if you fancy a read, it is a perfectly readable book. It is not, however, a masterpeice.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yes, of course it was good, its part of The Hunger Games! What else can I say? The price was fair for the popularity of the book at the time.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|The humans have \\"noticed\\" the vampires and lycans and are quite reasonably annoyed that they've been milking us for blood for centuries. A pogrom ensues and the few surviving undead have gone underground. Selene and Michael have been captured and have been in deep freeze for over a decade. Selene escapes, but who let her go?<br /><br />And so we arrive at part 4 of the Underworld franchise. A new production team but no new ideas. Let's start with the bad and move onto the good...<br /><br />Plot? there ain't none. There's a back-story, the story-boarders were clearly very busy bees, but there's no >story&lt;. The cast run around a lot, look gorgeous or gross (depending on species) but no-one is really achieving much or going anywhere. Well, I guess you don't pick something like Underworld up at the video store after thinking \\"Hmm, a good, complex story with twists, turns, chicanery and various other alarums and excursions is what I REALLY want tonight...\\" but they could have made an effort couldn't they? The first two Underworlds had plot; tensions, surprises and so-on - complexity, however simplistic... how hard can it be?<br /><br />Really though, Awakening is a vehicle. A vehicle for two things - the lovely Kate and some quite astonishing quantities of gore. That brings us to the good. Kate Beckinsale certainly is easy on the eye. Her skintight PVC uniform returns, and she certainly knows how to use it: her moves are familiar (if a tad... predictable); leaping from buildings, swirling of leather greatcoats, straining of bodices and gussets. For those of you who prefer good looking fellas? Well I'm hardly qualified to comment but this is a bloke flick so you ladies will have to make do with Theo James, because Stephen Rea and Charles Dance (doing a creditable, if unimaginative Bill Nighy impression) probably won't ring too many bells and a digitally projected Scott Speedman spends most of his screen-time upside-down in a fridge.<br /><br />The gore... oh the gore. There's nothing subtle about Underworld Awakening. The previous episodes were bloody, but Awakening turns it up to 11, with head-shots, decapitations and the traumatic (and often manual) removal of critical organs. Even Selene's sweet, 12 year old daughter (and that barely counts as a spoiler, I can assure you) gets in on the act, ripping lycans in half down the medial line and so-on. OK, so it's a vampire/werewolf flick and we should expect stuff like this. It's fine. I can enjoy a good, brutalising evisceration like any normal person, but it does get a little... indecent? Desensitising? Dare I say it... unimaginative?<br /><br />So there you go. More of the same (as a fellow reviewer has already said). I truly loved the first, enjoyed the second and was disappointed by the third. I think, for all its faults, Awakening is still a good gore fest, undead actioner, excellent for a Friday or Saturday night after coming home from the pub and it falls somewhere between its predecessors. Good but not great. Acceptable but not aspirational. I'll give it 3 stars. I'd like to give it 4, but I think 3 is the best I can do at the moment.<br /><br />This is a 2 disc edition and the second has the usual line up of extras that I haven't yet got around to watching (or even listing). I shall remedy that at the soonest opportunity.ere's nothing subtle about Underworld Awakening.

1849903670|5.0|The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes<br /><br />These are the first twelve short stories about the most famous detective in fiction. They were written in the 1890s when illumination came from fire (candles, oil lamps, and gas). Local travel was by horse or foot. No telephones. Technology has advanced but human nature remains the same. The character of `Sherlock Holmes' was inspired by Doctor Joseph Bell, the famous medical professor in Edinburgh Scotland. Reading the original stories reminds you how good they are, much better than the many imitators. Greed is the motive for most of these stories. I wonder how many were adapted from long forgotten true crime cases?<br /><br />.A Scandal in Bohemia. A big, tall man visits Holmes on a secret mission. This nobleman is in a photograph with an actress, and this can endanger an arranged dynastic marriage. Holmes is given £1,000 for expenses [a small fortune then]. Holmes uses a trick to find a hidden valuable object.<br />.The Red-Headed League. A man with blazing red hair visits Holmes with his problem of a lost well-paying job. Holmes visits his shop on a side street. A watch at night catches the burglar and saves the bank its fortune in French gold. Holmes explains his deductions. A man who works for half-wages?<br />.A Case of Identity. A young woman wants to find a missing fianc&eacute; who disappeared before their wedding. Holmes figures out the fraud and why it was done. The law can't touch this scoundrel. [The impressions of a typewriter can identify each unique machine.]<br /><br />.The Boscombe Valley Mystery. Charles McCarthy was found dead by a lake, his son James was arrested as a suspect. Holmes thinks the son is innocent, but has a secret. Holmes studies the crime scene and collects the clues, then identifies the murderer. James was acquitted, a confession did not have to be used. Justice was served, not the law.<br />.The Five Orange Pips. A young man visits Holmes for advice. He tells what happened to his uncle and father. Now he received the same message. Can Holmes save him and catch those responsible. Or will they answer to a higher power?<br />.The Man With the Twisted Lip. Kate Whitney visits Dr. Watson about her missing husband, an opium addict. Watson finds her husband, then joins Holmes in a search for Neville St. Clair. Only a professional beggar could know what happened to him! Holmes succeeds in locating the missing man.<br /><br />.The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle. A man lost his hat and a goose in a street fight. Can the owner be found? The goose was cooked, the rightful owner received a replacement. Will an innocent man be convicted for a theft? No. Holmes shows mercy.<br />.The Adventure of the Speckled Band. A young woman consults Holmes about her fears, her older sister died earlier. Why was her bedroom changed? What makes her stepfather so fierce? [Mad as a hatter?] Helen's life is saved, the guilty person falls into his own trap.<br />.The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb. A murderous attack severed the thumb of a young hydraulic engineer. He tells his story to Holmes. He was offered high pay for a few hours of work in secret. He had a narrow escape! Holmes takes him to Scotland Yard and they go to Eyford. But it is too late, the criminals escaped capture.<br />.The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor. Lord St. Simon asks Holmes for advice on a runaway bride. Was there anything in her past to cause this? Holmes solves this mystery by following a back trail. [What does this say about the nobility?]<br />.The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet. A tall, portly man visits Holmes. This banker loaned £50,000 to a nobleman who gave a beryl coronet as security. After it partly disappeared a relative was arrested. Can Holmes recover the lost gems and solve the crime? Yes, he explains what was overlooked. The guilty party will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.<br />.The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. A young woman asks for advice on changing jobs, she is offered very good pay. But she must cut her long hair short. Weeks later she sent a telegram to Holmes asking for help. Holmes arrives to solve the mystery. There is a happy ending.
B0049985XW|5.0|It had been many years since I first saw this movie, so I didn't remember any of it. I'm glad I got it, because it is something I will watch again soon. It is interesting to compare the photography of older firms to today's work. Those old films illustrate how talented they had to be to film without the wiz-bang of today's gear.
B004132HZS|1.0|Sherlock Season One, 2011 film<br /><br />The \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" stories are classic mysteries that also record the society of the late 19th and early 20th century Great Britain. They also record the beginnings of criminalistics. Setting the stories in modern times can make them seem more realistic and avoid the problems in recreating a century-old background. But culture and laws are different from over a hundred years ago. Writers who copy the originals do not have the talent to create their own characters. Part of the appeal of the original classic stories is their world just before modern technology. Horse-drawn transport and steam locomotives, a world lit by fire (candles and gas lamps), no telephone or electricity, etc. make these stories a travelogue into the past. Even fingerprints or ballistics are not in use! Council Housing and the Labor Party eliminated most of the Victorian slum housing, and there were other changes. A cartoon parody is inferior to the original. Note the right to keep and bear arms then. The National Health Service would have provided a salaried job for a young doctor. Watson would not have needed to share the costs of a flat. Setting these stories in modern times produces mistakes. \\"What is good is not new, what is new is not good.\\"<br /><br />Sherlock: A Study in Pink<br />This story is based on \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" but without the chapters spent in 19th century America that provide the background and motive. The faults in this drama result from copying some features from the original and creating new ones. This version of SH seems overly nervous and high-strung compared to the original. The murders committed here seem senseless (without the events in America). There were plenty of murders and other crimes that required expertise to solve them. [Most murders are caused by love or money, to get it or to keep it.] There is usually a personal involvement between victim and perpetrator. Murders by serial killers, or organized crime, are harder to solve since there is usually no prior involvement between the victim and the killer. This story seems ridiculous in having a murderer commit crimes during his working hours! I don't think that is probable. The story also makes jokes about the original characters.. Copying the original prevents them from creating a better story. I think admirers of the original won't like it, and others won't become fans of this series. There will be a few exceptions, of course. [Using nicotine patches is a cute idea, but some say nicotine gum is better.]<br /><br />Sherlock: The Great Game<br />Holmes talks to a prisoner in a Minsk jail (who speaks English). There is a joke about hanging, and Holmes leaves. Watson finds something in the refrigerator. There is a noise from outside. Watson sees the news on TV. Mycroft visits Sherlock to look into a death of a civil servant who worked in the Defense Department. Lestrade calls Sherlock about a letter. A warning? A photo of a room in an E-mail message. There is a phone call from a woman in a car. Sherlock analyzes the behavior of a young man for a young woman. Watson inspects a pair of shoes. Sherlock adds to it, then remembers and old case where the shoes were missing. Another strange phone call to Sherlock. He goes to look at a rented car. What is in the manager's wallet? The case is solved (the wife was in on it)! Another emergency call. There is a dead body of a TV hostess that needs inspection. What are they dealing with? Sherlock solves the murder, it was done with a botox injection! Another telephone call, they find a body by the Thames. Sherlock deduces information from a dead man. Sherlock visits an art gallery, he has sources of information. A giant man attacks Sherlock and Watson. [No gunshots?] Sherlock figured out why that picture was a fake: a detail in the sky. Next to solve the death of that civil servant. We see how the body was planted. The missing memory stick was recovered. There is a meeting by a swimming pool. Jim shows up to tell about his skills. He boasts about burning Sherlock, putting one over. [Is this believable?] There is a last scene that avoids an ending. This story jumps around too much with too many different plots. Sherlock diagnosed the dress of a young man and formed a conclusion as to character. This is proven wrong in the ending, its part of the parody.
B0083GNOYW|5.0|This was the best season finale I have seen from this show. I won't give it away, but the bride is revealed. Ted finds a possible love. etc. Worth your time.
0866119760|5.0|The Adventures & Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes, A. Conan Doyle<br /><br />A. Conan Doyle wrote these stories in the 1890s. Lighting came from fire (candles, oil lamps, gas). Local travel was by horse or foot. No telephones. Technology has advanced but human nature remains the same. The character of `Sherlock Holmes' was inspired by Doctor Joseph Bell, the famous medical professor in Edinburgh Scotland. Reading the original stories reminds you how good they are, better than any imitators. Money is the motive for most of these stories; love is minimized. I wonder if any were adapted from long forgotten true crimes?<br /><br />A Scandal in Bohemia. A big, tall man visits Holmes on a secret mission. This nobleman is in a photograph with an actress, and this can endanger an arranged dynastic marriage. Holmes is given £1,000 for expenses [a small fortune then].

Holmes thinks the son is innocent, but has a secret. Holmes studies the crime scene and collects the clues, then identifies the murderer. James was acquitted, a confession did not have to be used. Justice was served, not the law.<br />The Five Orange Pips. A young man visits Holmes for advice. He tells what happened to his uncle and father. Now he received the same message. Can Holmes save him and catch those responsible. Or will they answer to a higher power?<br />The Man With the Twisted Lip. Kate Whitney visits Dr. Watson about her missing husband, an opium addict. Watson finds her husband, then joins Holmes in a search for Neville St. Clair. Only a professional beggar knows what happened to him! Holmes succeeds in locating the missing man.<br />The Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle. A man lost his hat and a goose in a street fight. Can the owner be found? The goose was cooked, the rightful owner received a replacement. Will an innocent man be convicted for a theft? No. Holmes shows mercy.<br />The Adventure of the Speckled Band.

[Mad as a hatter?] Helen's life is saved, the guilty person falls into his own trap.<br />The Adventure of the Engineer's Thumb. A murderous attack severed the thumb of a young hydraulic engineer. He tells his story to Holmes. He was offered high pay for a few hours of work in secret. He had a narrow escape! Holmes takes him to Scotland Yard and they go to Eyford. But it is too late, the criminals escaped capture.<br />The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor. Lord St. Simon asks Holmes for advice on a runaway bride. Was there anything in her past to cause this? Holmes solves this mystery by following a back trail. [What does this say about the nobility?]<br />The Adventure of the Beryl Coronet. A tall, portly man visits Holmes. This banker loaned £50,000 to a nobleman who gave a beryl coronet as security. After it partly disappeared a relative was arrested. Can Holmes recover the lost gems and solve the crime? Yes, he explains what was overlooked. The guilty party will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment.<br />The Adventure of the Copper Beeches. A young woman asks for advice on changing jobs, she is offered very good pay. But she must cut her long hair short. Weeks later she sent a telegramto Holmes asking for help. Holmes arrives to solve the mystery. There is a happy ending.<br /><br />Silver Blaze. A favorite horse disappears and its trainer killed. This benefits some bookmakers. We read the known facts of this event. Holmes inspects the murder scene, and looks beyond to find the hoofprints. He visits a nearby stable owner and gives him instructions. What did the dog do in the night? Holmes produces the missing horse and solves the killing.<br />The Yellow Face. A man visits Holmes on a delicate question that involves his wife. She makes mysterious visits to a nearby cottage. What is her secret? Holmes and Watson visit this cottage and learn the secret. There is a happy ending for all.<br />The Stockbroker's Clerk.

B006OFN0SE|1.0|I can't believe that someone like Clint Eastwood will waste his time and money making a movie about the biggest black mail artist in US history and picking a lower tier actor like L. DiCaprio that has been trying to redeem himself after Titanic...but is never going to happen. I don't care what people think about Inception, he doesn't have the chops to play serious roles!!!<br /><br />To the elite few that watch the history channel(H2), J. Edgar had the biggest porn collection in history, one that he collected for himself from HIS AGENTS and developed a filing system because he worked in a library when he was younger.<br /><br />Therefore when the FBI started which was really a joke because the men in the agency weren't really qualified as agents per say, he made files of people's sexual lives to blackmail them from JFK, NIXON and many senators and congressman. So someone like JFK couldn't fire him because as we know he loved women. I can't imagined what would've happened to Clinton if this idiot was alive in the 1990s. But Im glad he's dead.<br /><br />He also had a thing for homosexuals in the FBI and guess what. He was GAY. He had a male companion for over 40 years and whom he left his state after he passed away..<br /><br />To me after all my research and the History Channel, this was a waste of the tax payers money. Worse yet, I can't believe Clint Eastwood will spend his time and money on something like this.<br /><br />Clint, I'm a big fan but you were WAY of base on this one. Maybe you had too much beer like on the movie EVERY WHICH WAY BUT LOOSE!!<br /><br />RATING -100<br /><br />Don't waste your money if you are a history buff....and thank you H2 channel for opening my eyes. I had no idea this guy was this bad and an embarrassment to the history of this country. This should be in the $1.00 bin.

B004A8ZWWO|3.0|Heist is a funny and fun at times movie with a great comedic cast and typical politically correct directing.  Albeit, Question; why are all the Hollywood bad guys white, male, and usually rich, or republican or insinuated to be conservative or religious? We're really getting tired of the Hollywood typical stereotypes and social programming.
B005FUTBWS|5.0|Red State is a BRILLIANT modern horror/thriller on dvd now from Kevin Smith. EXCELLENT, thought provoking, politically charged, but entertaining. Must See! Probably better to see without seeing the trailer, but see it any way you can. Loved it.
B0014VQGX4|2.0|The backhoe was beautifully crafted and might be a great toy for children four or five and older. Unfortunately the connections of the front and rear bucket were very fragile and were broken within the first few hours of play.  This might be a great toy for five and up, but it is probably too fragile for younger kids.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I not only am very pleased with the speed of service; I am very happy with the quality of the DVD.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|I thought it waqs a good movie. Worth watching. I can't believe some of the comments related to the 1 star reviews. One guy gave it a one star because he didn't get to see a 16 year old (IRL) naked. ANother thought it was OK, until he realized Sean Penn was involved. It would have been different if he didn't like it at all & then found out Penn did it & then said \\"well that makes sense\\".<br /><br />A lot of other giving this a bad review sound like bitter old men that expect everyone to conform to their narrow minded view of the world.<br /><br />Whatever! agree or disagree with the choices a person makes. Fine. But to give a well done movie an F because you disagree with the main character is rather weak.

Along with fighting to save each and every unique patient that steps through Seattle Grace's doors, the residents (towards the end of the season) are stressfully fighting to pass their boards. When all seems well and good, it was time for the season's end.<br /><br />And it sure ended with a bang.<br /><br />Your favorite doctors are put in a traumatic situation unlike their everyday trauma.<br />They are the victims.

1591844096|5.0|This book really makes you think about not just business, but the world around us and how it operates.  I love Seth's writing style and find it hard to put his books down (reading my 5th now - in less than 2 months).  My daughter (15) is reading Linchpin - She is a perfectionist and puts so pressure on herself in school - from work to her hair and clothes (typical teen)and is worried that she won't get into a great college...  Hoping that when she reads this book she will give herself permission to not be perfect and to challenge the status quo.  So far she is enjoying it - and my brother has asked to be next in line to read it.  Highly recommend...
0671027344|5.0|This is the first time i ever review anything on amazon, and I'm glad its for this book, its truly amazing!!!!!!
B000UZNRS2|4.0|I think that this is one of Baldacci's best books.....great detail, suspense and intrigue. As an Army brat, the story really reeled me in to the workings of the military, the government and a disreputable back country coal operation. A perfect summer read!
B007WV05GY|2.0|Given the production values and a pretty good cast, I had high hopes, but apparently not high enough, as this movie only pissed me off increasingly as it rolled along.  Well executed crash, but unfortunately, downhill from there.  Evidently the viewer is supposed to believe that it wouldnt occur to a single survivor to search bodies and wreckage for weapons and food, as though anybody would go off to the Artic without both.  And what was in all those backpacks?  And you could tumblej down icy rapids with no hypothermia, and on and on.  My kingdom for a spear?

0062119044|4.0|This book is best understood as a nightmare landscape rather than as a depiction of reality. Few (if any) mothers have ever produced a monster as horrifying as Kevin but what woman, when contemplating bringing a stranger into the world, doesn't secretly fear that it will all go completely wrong? We've all had it drummed into us that having kids drastically changes a relationship, in our worst nightmares the kids become a wedge between us and the person we love most in the world. This is a well written, suspenseful, touching, and cathartic rendition of this fear. If you like that sort of thing, you will find the book enjoyable. If you prefer plausibility you should probably look elsewhere. Personally, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />There are a few unexpected enjoyments for those who are not hung up on whether a story like this could really happen. First, being only a couple months older than Kevin himself, I thoroughly enjoyed the mid-late nineties nostalgia, if the story itself is unlikely, the setting is expertly drawn and perfectly realistic. I also found the character of Kevin unexpectedly likable and the Eva/Kevin relationship was certainly much more intriguing than the Eva/Franklin marriage. The thesis that we want to be understood even more than we want to be loved is hardly original but it is certainly worth engaging with on a regular basis. Overall, this was well worth the time and money.
B002BWP49M|4.0|I rate it four because it was still a good movie but just like the book, the best part is going to be the second half of the story. The ending was pretty cool too.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|they finally updated it so your crops and buildings dont reset to 7+ days till you can collect from them. so now its pretty awesome
0345803485|1.0|After struggling and \\"rolling my eyes\\" through the first several chapters of this book (at the horrendous grammar, lack of and/or strange misuse of punctuation, and utterly repetitive ramblings that had me recalling middle school story-writings from the kids who were reading at a second grade level and could barely form complete sentences), I looked up the author to see if she was a high school student or something, hoping for a smidge of insight as to how this atrocity of an \\"author\\" got her book published. It reminded me of my struggles to get through the 'Twilight' series and my complete inability to understand why people rave about that poorly constructed mishmash of sparkling vampire idiocy. How interesting (but not exactly shocking), to find that her inspiration is Stephanie Meyer, who was, until now, the poorest current writer I had encountered in print.<br /><br />I was already saddened by the lackluster 'Twilight' series gaining such outrageous popularity, but to see '50 Shades of Grey' getting such rave reviews... I am so very far from being an English-major type, but \\"holy/double/triple crap,\\" are we really so simpleminded as people to consider this quality entertainment? People are just reading this garbage because they inexplicably love the simple-minded 'Twilight'... right?
B000CNESU8|5.0|The often used phrase \\"They don't make 'em like that anymore\\" is often proved wrong, usually by the brothers Coen. (They make old movies. Brilliant ones.)<br /><br />Here, however, is one that they don't make anymore, one that needs to be seen now, maybe more so than it needed to be seen on release. I was a member of the privileged group to see this as a teenager, and came away stunned. Brilliant casting, brilliant cast and the idea then seemed outlandish, but now it appears to have been sadly prophetic.<br /><br />The dialogue in this film is one of the high water marks in writing for cinema, razor sharp, penetrating and possessed of a rather potent vocabulary. This is not a film for 8 year olds of all ages, it requires a focus, a desire to do more than merely sit and stare but to listen as well as watch.<br /><br />The film is a powerhouse, a brick thrown from a high rise window, but just as important, it is far more subtle than a one time viewing would suggest.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|Yes, it is a pretty game, but that's about it. It's buggy, but more important, it's boring. Their idea of hidden objects is to find 10+ of the same item. Game play was always interrupted by dialog. sooooo much dialog. Soooo much tapping to get to the next screen.<br /><br />I know there were other small bugs, but the one that really pissed me off is trying to move the objects in the maze puzzles. The ones where you had to move from one side of the screen to the other. I had to keep swiping the objects over and over and over.
0061186473|4.0|I'm a big Gaiman fan, and if you're new to Gaiman I guess you have to start somewhere. This is a reasonable place to start, but I don't think it reflects his best work. As in all anthologies there are some winners, (the Holy Grail story \\"Chivalry\\", the 12 months sitting around telling stories in \\"October in the Chair\\"), and some losers. There are also a number of early pieces that aren't particularly satisfactory. I could see a YA reader finishing this, being underwhelmed, and not going back to Gaiman, which would be a shame.<br /><br />Gaiman takes lots of risks, tries his hand at many different types of story-telling, and goes where his interests and whims lead him, which makes him hard to pin down and almost impossible to anthologize. As a result it takes more patience than usual for a reader to get a bead on any particular work. So, it seems to me that the best advice is to just try a few works; one is sure to hit the sweet spot.<br /><br />For what it's worth, to my mind, \\"Neverwhere\\", \\"The Graveyard Book\\" or even \\"Stardust\\" might be better places for a YA reader to start.
0307951529|5.0|Really enjoyed this book, contained a lot of helpful information and gave me a lot of motivation. Will defiantly read this again and would recommend to others.
0061478784|4.0|I like Diana Wynne Jones' sense of humor and her characters. She is endlessly inventive in a very satisfying way. (A lot of her work reminds me of Terry Pratchett, another favorite.)<br /><br />  But, this book is intricate, complex and at times exhaustingly complex. That's OK, but be warned that this book demands a high level of patience and application, which may or may not be consistent with your reader's skills and aptitudes. On the other hand, this is certainly a big step up from the usual middle grade read, so it is a great next step for a growing reader.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have read almost all of the available novels set in a post-apocalyptic world and this is by far the most well written of them all. The character development and plot were far better than many famous, &#34;professional&#34; authors. Publishers should be lining up! … superb.
B005IS565S|5.0|Five Finger Death Punch delivers what their fans love once again with American Capitalist. Loud and rough, Ivan Moody's vocals are unmatched and characteristic of the band's previous albums. In contrast to \\"Way of the Fist\\" the band finds a softer voice on a couple tracks (i.e. \\"Remember Everything\\") that are toned-down enough for radio play, but I feel they still maintain the characteristic 5FDP sound and roughness to such a degree that there's no fear of them being accused of selling out. It's typical of bands to diversify as they hit their stride (compare tracks on Disturbed's first album with their last couple). 5FDP mixing in some ballads is simply a reflection of that. No matter how you cut it, if you liked their previous albums, this one will certainly not disappoint.
0345803485|1.0|I found it hard to get past the first chapter.  I can't believe a woman wrote this!  First of all, a mega sucessful man doesn't work in a 20 story building.  Secondly, someone who is fumbling out of embarrassment doesn't call the man of all power \\"a control freak\\".  This was only published because of the writer's connections, not her talent.  Don't bother to buy into the press of how great this is.  Three day old tuna smells better!
B007BVOF8E|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but agree with other reviewers that compressing the book and series to a 2 hour movie was too ambitious.  Great story from a great book.  The stellar acting by Gary Oldman makes this movie worth watching.
1933633867|5.0|This book has the capacity to lift the publishing industry out of its slough. Extensively referenced, beautifully written with great humanity. I have already made 5 purchases following the ideas presented in this book. Event after event is described in a new and compassionate context. What is the relationship between the Incas, the Chinese Ming Dynasty and a Medieval English village? You can't imagine one. There is actually a very strong, yet startling relationship. The Nasruddin stories are among my favourites but there is much to inspire and distract.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read all 3 books in about a week and was upset that I was done with them! I wanted more!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love playing spider solitaire .  I am glad I found the game on my kindle fire.  loads of fun.
B00723NWJE|5.0|everything Norah Jones does is amazing, this is no exception.  Although different from previous albums, you cannot really expect an artist to keep doing the same thing.  I would never have paired danger Mouse with Norah in my mind, but the results are way better than anything I would have expected.  I really enjoy when an artist takes a different direction and the results are exceptional, this is awesome.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|The acting was superb.  Mel Gibson and Eliot gave great performances.  The subject of war is tough and brutal and maybe movies like this might discourage this country from other mistake and this is said recognizing the courage of those who died.  A very good film.
0345803485|1.0|OI. Where to begin?<br /><br />First of all, I don't usually read this kind of book, but since it's gotten so many rave reviews, I decided to see what all the fuss was about. I've been pissed off ever since. Let me just start by saying that the writing is horrible. Juvenile and trite immediately come to mind. Second, the author should be ashamed of herself. The entire premise is offensive to women as a whole.<br /><br />We have a 21 year old virgin from a dysfunctional home and a 27 year old sexual predator who sets his sights on her. But it's okay because he's rich and good looking and she signed an agreement up front not to tell anyone what he does to her. Are you freaking kidding me?<br /><br />Mothers beware. The levels of absolute debasement to women is astounding here. I have a hard time believing a woman wrote this and if she did, she needs her head examined. This book is a cautionary tale and the publishers should be flogged for putting it out there.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and leave this garbage where it belongs. In the trash.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Do you remember that scene in \\"Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle\\" Where Harold (John Cho) and Kumar (Kal Penn) are hiding in the women's restroom as those two women play \\"battle sh--s\\" with one another? It was not only expected that that scene would be better than the 131 minute duration of \\"Battleship\\", but the way that scene possibly smelled would also be like a bed of roses in comparison. Brought to you by Hasbro, the company that brought us \\"Transformers\\" is a movie that looks like it's trying so hard to be exactly what you've already seen in those three blockbuster movies. The actual result is one thousand times worse than you can possibly imagine.<br /><br />For the first 45 minutes, you're left wondering where in the world is this movie the trailers hinted at? You're introduced to Taylor Kitsch as Lieutenant Alex Hopper, who appears to be still drinking off the failure of \\"John Carter\\". Alex is the stubborn rebel who never listens to anybody and flies by the seat of his pants except all of his decisions would be idiotic even to a ten year old. On his birthday, he is jobless, drinking with his brother Stone (Alexander Skarsgård), is shot in the back with a taser gun after breaking into a closed gas station food mart trying to obtain a chicken burrito to impress a buxom blonde named Sam (Brooklyn Decker), and is drafted to the Navy the following morning by Stone.<br /><br />If that wasn't enough, you're subjected to a game of soccer where Alex continues to be terrible at everything as he gets kicked in the face, misses a goal that would've sent the game into overtime, loses the nerve to request permission from Sam's father Admiral Shane (Liam Neeson) about marrying Sam, and gets into a bathroom brawl with Japanese Captain Yugi Nagata (\\"Thor\\"'s Tadanobu Asano). Isn't this amazing, you guys? It's exactly like the board game you used to play growing up!<br /><br />Then the aliens arrive. You tried to contact alien life with groundbreaking technology and then you're surprised when you get a devastating response that could affect the world as we know it. Smooth. As they arrive, Peter Berg reveals just how much he looks up to Michael Bay as he tries to mimic every explosion, action sequence, and plot device the Californian director has become successful for. \\"Battleship\\" is a combination of \\"Armageddon\\", all of the \\"Transformers\\" movies, Halo, and James Cameron's \\"Titanic\\" as the main references to the board game lie within ammunition from the alien ships looking like game pegs and the entire \\"water displacement\\" scene being the actors playing the game itself on a huge screen. The line \\"You sunk my battleship!\\" is never uttered. They had to make room for a fist fight between a man with no legs and one of the aliens. Oh, if only that was meant to be a joke.<br /><br />The acting is really, really bad. Taylor Kitsch attempts to be the lovable idiot, but he comes off as more of a lite version of Keanu Reeves. This is also Rihanna's acting and feature film debut, but her character was only designed to state the obvious and verbalize sound effects (\\"BOOM!\\"). Hamish Linklater's entire performance seems to be inspired by Tom Green and Liam Neeson could only stomach having six or seven minutes of screen time despite how much money was thrown at him. It's like they cast Hawaiian natives and war veterans with no acting experience in many of the supporting roles.<br /><br />\\"Battleship\\" wants to be \\"Transformers\\" so bad. The lame and juvenile attempts at humor are along the same lines as the humor everybody hated in \\"Revenge of the Fallen\\" that was crammed down your throat the majority of the movie. Its formula is even similar; aliens invade earth and destroy everything they can with a plan to overcome the Earth, a (bunch of) secondary character(s) dies that inspire the main cast, the once thought useless character becomes useful, saves the day, and grows into a hero without learning a lesson but teaches the world to succumb to his reckless ways. The only difference is \\"Battleship\\" has this old man AC/DC montage that goes on entirely too long and they make a battleship drift out in the ocean that would impress anyone from the \\"Fast & Furious\\" franchise.<br /><br />\\"Battleship\\" is just so awful every way you look at it. If you could somehow take out the entire first hour and the last fifteen minutes, and watch all of the action sequences on mute, it would still only be partially watchable. If the atrocious acting and mind numbingly familiar storyline weren't enough, the regurgitated attempt at recycling Michael Bay's success should be enough to send you running and screaming out of the theater.

B003Y5H5BA|5.0|dont listen to what them 1-3 star people say this movie was hilarious. funniest movie i have ever seen. they need to announce a second movie. 5 stars
B007V2UGPE|4.0|great game. upgrades keep you busy and the game looks and sounds great! some upgrades make you pay real money but they are not necessary or even important. the combat is ok nothing special. definitely worth playing
B005UBNKWO|5.0|Listen folks I own the fx-6100 I upgraded from an Athlon II X3. I see better performance than what I had along with the better and newer parts I bought obviously. If you want an inexpensive processor that will play most games and have them look good to the human eye or you just internet and watch blu-ray movies then this a great processor upgrade. This is a great processor for REAL WORLD usage. If you are wanting an upgrade from some ultra beast cpu that was clearly designed for benchmarkers and hardcore gaming and you have it overclocked to the moon this isnt for you. What people dont seem to understand is AMD's real focus now is graphics (since they bought ATI), mainstream market, and the corporate server world. This is a mainstream market CPU and if you are a power user then yes this does have some overclock features and some ways you can get more out of it. I hope this will help some people in a future purchase to the real world performance of this CPU and not what some benchmark (which btw most or Intel cpu biased) has to say.<br /><br />All that said I have mine overclocked to 4.0ghz and doesnt get much hotter than it was at stock heats. For the price point that this CPU is at now its totally worth the money if you coming off an Athlon II or lower. As I said if you are rolling in the money and can afford the extreme edition i7's or whatever then this isnt even your league anyway. Again If you are person who does everyday stuff like watches videos and uses the internet and then every now and then youd like to play a game or two like an MMO or even modern warfare 3 this is great for all of that.
0802130208|5.0|I bought this book for a book club I am in. I was a little weary of buying a used book because you never know what the quality is going to be like. But the description said \\"very good\\" so I went for it. The description was no lie. The book was in great shape. No tattered or dog-eared pages and the cover showed little to no wear. I will be buying many more used books from Amazon.
B0061S0A64|5.0|A must have for music fan and musician alike!! Node Beat is a very creative and fun app for anyone. The fan of music will find hours of fun, just watching nodes bounce around the screen, and moving them around to discover new sound patterns. For a seasoned musician like myself, it is a neat tool for inspiring creative sound ideas for future music compositions. Easy to use, and fun as well.

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I downloaded to try this, being that I grew up with the original Oregon Trail as a child.  I really wasn't enjoying it that much (too much like a \\"Farmvile\\" game), so I removed it from my Kindle.  When I went to pay my credit card, I found that three \\"game cash\\" purchases were made from the game without my approval.  I know that my children did not do this because I have the parental control lock in place for ANY purchases or installs of new apps.  While Amazon was very helpful in removing these charges, I have to now spend extra time watching for more bogus charges from this company.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really fun it's so much easier playing on my Kindle than on my fun. thanks for this exciting game plus it's over a hundred games for free!!!

0060873027|1.0|This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but it's close.  Michael Crichton had amazingly creative stories and this could have been another Jurassic Park, had he lived, and written the story that was in his head.  Unfortunately, it's a longer remake of \\"Honey I Shrunk The Kids\\" with a bad guy thrown in for good measure.  I kept getting the feeling that it was really written as the basis for a movie or a video game.  If you are a 12 year old boy, you may like it.  Otherwise, don't bother.
B004FOA84A|5.0|This was my first adventure game and I had a lot of fun with it! It took me way longer than a couple of hours to complete but thatvmadr it all the more worth the money! I would love more of this type of game.

B004T4LUPW|5.0|It was so easy to download and sync  (I synced outlook to my google - then turned off the outlook sync, then sync google to Calendgoo.  I had a couple duplicates at first - but cleaned it up once and now it syncs daily - no problems.  I love the agenda - turn on \\"floating events\\" and it gives you a check box to click when you finish, and it forwards it to tomorrow if you didn't finish.  Love that I can pull up all my calendars at once, or one at a time when needed (when I work, I close everything except my work calendar).  I feel so organized now.  I absolutely LOVE this calendar!!  I made separate calendars for birthdays, husband, me, kids, work etc... now I can look at the schedule as a whole, or an piece I need to.  I sync before I go out, and I can make appointments on the go - and when I get home (or in Wi-fi range) - it is automatically updated to my computer!  And it gives me audible reminders on my Fire if I set up pop up reminders.<br /><br />Had this about 6 months now.  Still using it every single day and I still love it.  Can't live without it now!
B005P59ANS|1.0|BUYER BEWARE! My dust cover door broke today and I was just told after waiting on hold with customer service for an hour and a half that effective May 1st 2012 Lifeproof no longer has an advance replacement policy. I must go without a case until I mail mine back and wait on a replacement. The dust cover doors on these cases break very easily and this is a common problem. By making people wait for a replacement, the company is hoping that people will just get fed up and buy another. This is a terrible change in policy and will cost the company any additional business from me or my recommendation to anyone else. I have purchased six of these cases and have recommended them to at least 50 people. Love the cases but customer service is very important as well, and this change in policy is a giant leap in the wrong direction. I will be posting this information on the customer ratings sections of the Best Buy, Amazon, Buy.com, and iPhone accessory web-sights along with a rating of 1 star. If I can cost the company at least 1000 sales due to my dissatisfaction with their change in customer service policy, it should overcome any savings that they might realize through their change in policy. I would encourage any other customers with similar concerns to post similar comments.<br />Mike

0393064476|5.0|This book read like an old-time detective novel - a real page-turner. Slowed down towards the end but for good reason. For anyone who is interested in the link between history & the modern age, this I feel, is a must-read! Wonderfully written.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I've long heard how great this trilogy of books is, and I couldn't help but cheating by watching the Swedish trilogy of films first.  But I know books are usually better, and this one was no disappointment.<br /><br />The reader is introduced to the leader character, a veteran journalist of a controversial magazine that is ruined professionally and financially by losing a lawsuit.  During his time of loss, he is hired privately by a wealthy man of a large but obscure family to solve the disappearance of his sixteen-year-old girl missing since the 1960's.<br /><br />Enters title character, a girl that lives outside of a world of editing newspapers, company parties, wealthy people who is eccentric but extremely intelligent, and if nothing else, deliberate in everything she does.  For a woman victimized by society on one way or another her entire life, by no means is she a victim.<br /><br />By the time the journalist and the title character meet, together they begin a complex journey to solve a series of atrocities committed against women for decades.  The story twists and turns enough to show that all is not what it seems; therefore, the ending to me is not the predictable \\"whodunit\\" template.<br /><br />Afterwards, the girl with the dragon tattoo begins to grow within herself, realizing she can trust other people.  As she tries to change her life, it may be immediately as she planned, but she knows there's good out there and she's on the way to finding it.  All around, this is a mesmerizing read that's entertaining, with an excellent backdrop for violence against women.  Five stars!

0307716546|4.0|Grace, a devoted mother of two, narrates Afterwards, a compulsively readable thriller from the Rosamund Lupton of Sister fame. Grace is in a coma resulting from her heroic efforts to rescue her children from the burning school. In her current out-of-body state, Grace will become obsessed with finding out who is to blame for setting the fire that has devastated her happy family.<br /><br />The point-of-view in this novel is very unique. Grace is nearly omnipresent and can overhear conversations that in life she wouldn't be privy too. This makes her an interesting investigator because while she is at that advantage, she can't let the others know the things she has learned. Grace is telling the story to her husband and  while the novel is a crime thriller it is also a love story. I was surprised just how well the style worked for this novel.<br /><br />Sister is still waiting on my to-read shelf but I after hearing so much praise, I was excited to be able to read Afterwards. Once I started I really couldn't put it down, much to my husband's chagrin. It's been awhile since I've read a thriller so completely captivating. The mystery kept me guessing until the very end. Grace is a likable narrator--emotional yet witty; tender and insightful.<br /><br />While I appreciated Grace's thoughts on love for her family and her willingness to admit that she has wrongfully judged plenty of people during her life, she does repeat herself quite often and at times it become redundant. There is some swearing in the book that might be offensive to some readers. The swearing doesn't really fit the character's style and because of that it draws attention to it. In fact, the characters themselves talk about swearing which makes it pretty hard to miss but does fit with the story line.<br /><br />Overall, Afterwards is the kind of crime-novel thriller that I especially enjoy. It isn't overly graphic or gory and has lighter moments. With a near-perfect pace, it keeps the reader engrossed in the mystery and also becomes a testament to the eternal love of one's family.he mystery and also becomes a testament to the eternal love of one's family.

1609613937|5.0|\\"The Starch Solution\\" gives us Dr. McDougall's latest book after his ~40 years of leading people to optimal health. You will find consistency with the guidance in his other 12 or so books since 1983, his DVD's, monthly free newsletters, free website at drmcdougall.com, 5 and 10-day TOTAL HEALTH SOLUTION (THS) clinics, Advanced Study Weekends, and  Adventure Tours solely to Costa Rica now. The truth has legs!<br /><br />Dr. McD offers so much more than optimal nutrition guidance.  His 1985 book \\"McDougall's Medicine - A Challenging Second Opinion\\" shows that he has been at this very important aspect for a long time, too! He gets you off of many medical drugs and steers you away from over-testing and from submitting to many medical procedures.  Go to his website and download for free two e-lectures to watch on your computer. #1 -- \\"ACLM Presentation\\" in 2006 to the American College of Lifestyle Medicine Symposium - \\"Why current therapies for chronic diseases don't work & Why lifestyle medicine can't fail.\\"  #2 -- \\"Marketing Milk & Disease.\\"<br /><br />My family of four participated in his THS clinic over nine years ago, plus we went to his Costa Rica Adventure Tour 8 years ago, and have been on his plant-based, whole-foods, starch-centered optimal nutrition for health program since then.  I am 76 and healthy and take no medicines or supplements, except for B-12.  Good food should be your main focus -- 80% of health benefits come from optimal nutrition, 20% from better exercise.<br /><br />For the last 5 years, a retired family physician and I have conducted \\"Healthy Lifestyle\\" 10-sessions seminars, independent of public agencies.  We point participants to Dr. McDougall as the best overall health guidance source!  People quickly get healthier --  reversing type 2 diabetes, getting off of blood pressure medications, resolving GERD problems, etc.<br /><br />It was lonely and even hostile in 2003 for someone on a plant-strong nutrition path.  Fortunately, many more healthy lifestyle experts have been effectively teaching the world about the huge earth-improving benefits of eliminating animal-based products from your diets.

B000QCS8TW|1.0|The books are well written, and the background world is fascinating. Very few of the characters are one-dimensional.<br /><br />Apart from that, violence is the overwhelming theme. Every character is destined for a senseless maiming and/or death. Lots of sex, very little of it consensual. Graphic scenes of dismemberement litterally made me queasy - you'd have to be a fan of fps video games, or a member of a Mexican drug cartel to be inured to it.<br /><br />I stopped reading midway through book 4 (persistent I guess), because each chapter is just another depiction of brutality and doesn't advance any story. No justice, no overarching plot line, it makes no sense as a novel - if you want senseless brutality with no good ending, then read the newspaper, at least you'll be informed!<br /><br />These books could go on for ever, just replacing main characters with fresh victims, since everyone is expendable. You get attached to a well-fleshed out character and bam! he/she is dead/incapacitated/trapped in the most horrible situation - making you the victim of an elaborate hoax by the author. IT'S JUST NOT FUN!<br /><br />Oh yeah and the Kindle bundle is terrible - no page numbers, no table of content, no bookmarks.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|\\"No wind, no rain, ... can stop me\\" are a few words from the song, \\"Ain't No Mountain High Enough\\".  Isn't it ironic that the first concert begins and ends with this song?  Or maybe it's poetic justice which describes how the wind and the rain do stop Ms. Ross and this first concert.  Perhaps it's an act of God. So we have a new song or play of sorts being enacted, live from New York, staged at Central Park where no man, no woman, including Ms. Ross, can stand against the forces of nature.<br /><br />What actually happens to end the first shortened concert so abruptly?<br /><br />First, it starts to rain, but Ms. Ross continues to perform.  Then, even though the wind is strong enough to push Ms. Ross back, Ms. Ross continues to perform.  Finally, the strong winds and heavy rains force Ms. Ross to stop the show.  As this short concert ends, Ms. Ross makes a promise to return the next day.<br /><br />The next day is a new day, bright, and sunny - a day full of promise.  Ms. Ross returns to fulfills her promise. In this second and lengthened concert, she is  energetic, sexy, emotional, classy, and professional.<br /><br />Both concerts have huge numbers of people gathered at Central Park, along with a heavy police presence, \\"the boys in blue\\".  It's interesting to watch the dynamics between the police and the public, with Ms. Ross as the moderator.  She uses tact and wisdom in dealing with the audience, giving instruction when necesssary.<br /><br />The DVD video quality is not the same as a new DVD today.  The quality is the same as watching a regular standard television in 1983.  The audio is also not like a CD.  Nevertheless, the DVD is fine enough to enjoy.<br /><br />Here are the two open air concerts from the Summer of 1983 at New York's Central Park.<br /><br />First Concert<br /><br />July 21, 1983 Rain Concert<br />Total time (47:29): At under 48 minutes, I enjoyed this concert just as much as I enjoyed the second concert.<br /><br />Track List<br />1.

0345803485|1.0|This is Book is awful. It's not exactly terrible as much as it is highly boring and repetitive. Please see the other critical reviews, as they pretty much sum up my thoughts.  Perhaps a slightly intriguing, if cliche, storyline-- but with the most juvenile, basic writing I have read. Phrases are repeated over and over again dozens of times. If I had to read about \\"those pants that hung so deliciously from his hips\\" again, I would have croaked. This goes with the \\"# shades of grey\\" phrase, as in 7 shades of <expletive> up, fifty shades of mysterious, shades of grey, shades of whatever..... Someone just finished their high school literature devices cla ss ;-) And the characters are just so flat and ridiculous. Finally, the ending is quick, unresolved, and ridiculous. Perhaps a clever way for the author to extract more cash from you by offering sequels? Terrible!<br /><br />The biggest problem with Kindle and iBooks is that you can neither give the book back nor give it away!  Hard to believe this is a best seller. Do yourself a favor and skip this one!

The only people impressed and obssesed with these 'novels', are mainly women- suffering from imposed celibacy.Tat being 12 - 'why-is-there-no-more-twilight'-year olds. And as so accurately previously stated, over the hill singles and stay at home moms. (Not unlike the one who gave pen-birth to this pre-teen-dry-dream). All of which, forgive me, probably have no exposure to great sex, especially erotic sex. This book is mild, not shocking and it is Absolutely appallingly written. The grammar is terrible, and the repetition is painful. I can forgive sloppy writing in a first draft, but the thought that this actually made it through editors and publishers, before purchased is absurd.

1439153663|4.0|I couldn't put this book down. I enjoyed it very much. But I felt the courtship between Lavinia and Marshall was rushed. I would have liked to have seen a softer side of Marshall, that showed he had some feeling for her. I also felt some loose ends needed to be tied up with Will and Lavinia. I am not big into romance, but I think that is what was missing in this book.

B000GIXIGY|5.0|I was supposed to review Turn of the Cards last summer... and then again this winter... but I kept getting sidetracked by pointless stuff.  So *now* I'm ready to review it.<br /><br />What a classic.  I give this album nothing but the highest praise.  It's really difficult to choose a best Renaissance album but this one absolutely HAS to be in the top 3.  Annie's vocals and... oh wait a minute.  According to the notes *everyone* in the band is singing backup vocals!  What?  Really?  I can't think of any other band where this has happened!<br /><br />\\"Running Hard\\" is INCREDIBLE!  The dramatic and eerie piano build-up in the beginning soon reveals that this is not some kind of classical imitation but rather, classical influences intended to develop into an entirely different monster.  Once the beat gets going and Annie's vocals come in, oh boy.  Then the tune becomes really *really* awesome.  Annie's vocals sail and weave through the orchestration taing place in the background, and... the pace never slows down or approaches anything near disappointing (which is a popular problem I have with most music that attempts a similar approach- boredom rearing its ugly head eventually).  A perfect song the entire way through and the fast pace in the middle assures that *anyone* can appreciate it.<br /><br />\\"Mother Russia\\" has an intro that reminds me of somewhere enchanted, such as getting lost in the woods and finally finding the open fields and the feeling of mystery that you're not where you thought you'd end up.  Then however, something BAD rolls over the hills!  This all occurs during the adventurous 2 minutes of instrumental music taking place in the beginning.  Annie's vocals then promptly come in and the dramatic and highly melodic nature of the orchestration soon follows.  The chorus sounds like it only feature two notes repeatedly going back and forth but it feels totally fitting and not undeveloped or anything.  You know the \\"Red blood, white snow, so cold, so true, Mother Russia she cries for you\\" line.  Again though, not a complaint because it's awesome.  Only Renaissance can turn simplicity into brilliance assuring we don't even feel the need to pay attention to such songwriting choices.  Annie then howls near the 5-minute point and it sounds so chilling and fitting for a Russian theme.  The piano playing has more emotion than I'm able to convey into words.<br /><br />\\"Black Flame\\" has an eerie Pink Floyd-like way of opening the song (I'm thinking \\"Hey You\\" in particular) but the chorus is AWESOME!  The way Annie sings the line \\"I'm not to blame I didn't see the black flame\\" makes me almost cry with excitement.  It's REALLY good.  Actually the melody sort of reminds me of the one from Hawkwind's \\"We Took the Wrong Step Years Ago\\".  No way Renaissance were listening to those guys, however.  Two VERY different bands!  \\"I Think of You\\" contains a pretty melody and \\"Cold Is Being\\" is just... unusual.  The church organs are really cool and the melody is dreamy and chilling.<br /><br />\\"Things I Don't Understand\\" has a really cool intro with the jerky/jazzy way Annie sings the vocal melody.  The \\"la la la\\" section is just as memorable and the devastatingly beautiful \\"oh oh oh\\" male chorus that follows.  Talk about a band where every member knew *exactly* what they were doing- this is it!  Shortly after the 5-minute point, we experience a touch of heaven with the way Annie is able to hit all the right, high-pitched notes and the piano sprinkles just makes the experience perfect.  The piano and vocals at the end leaves more than a lasting impression.  A very strong note to end a superb track on.<br /><br />What a song... what an album!  I recommend picking it up right away, without delay!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my 6yr old loves the ice age movies and clips when she sees scratch run across the screen.  it's more than just a game to us... it has become a daily 15 minute routine- &quot;Daddy,how is my Viking Ice Village doing?&quot; everyday after work/ school.
0071762345|5.0|I have been actively using social media for business and personal purposes for over 6 years. While I knew this was going to be a good book based on Dave's reputation,  I was 1/2 thinking \\"Hey, I already know a lot about social media. Will I really learn much from this book?\\" Well, I was wrong. \\"Likeable\\" is chock full of fabulous insights that I will be bringing back to the team at my companies, RIGHTSLEEVE and commonsku.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as a practical guide for succeeding in this often confusing age of engagement media.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Oh My!  This is the silliest book ever.  It reads as if it were written by a 13 yr. old with a thesaurus close at hand.
0345803485|5.0|Keep reading!  Even if you think this book isn't your \\"cup of tea\\", just keep reading and you will be happy you did.  I was a little apprehensive as I approached the middle of the book, but by the end of this book - I went right out to get the rest of the trilogy because I wanted more!!  There is a reason all three are on the bestseller list.<br />Read. It.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|I too was reluctant, but for the good reviews I went ahead and rented this for my grandchild and was throughly delighted!  It's a DARLING movie and it leaves you HAPPY!  What more can be said.  I actually liked it as much as the first movie and my grandchild was just as happy.  So rent it and enjoy!  Don't let the negative minds deter you...they're just too old at heart to see as children do. So too bad for them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book! I couldn't put it down.  The other two books in the trilogy are just as good. Would definitely recommend.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I meant to save this book for my vacation. However, I made the mistake of reading the first paragraph. Now I have to find something else to read on vacation, and I know it won't compare to this little gem. I kept reading until I finished just a few minutes ago and was determined to write a review, which I seldom do. I want everyone to know this author deserves kudos, lots of them. It takes quite a bit of skill to make you love a character in just a few paragraphs and even more skill to make you rush through those paragraphs to find out what happens next. I am anxiously awaiting more of WOOL.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|My wife is the Train fan. She tells me it's not quite typical of their prior, but it is good.
0385342063|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book! I was a little sad when it ended. My favorite Sophie Kinsella book to date!
0571238343|5.0|I have been talking to many people about animation online and every last one of them told me to get this book. I soon decided to get it to see how it is and i have to say i like it, the price is great as well. For me this book got me to thinking how i should be animating, and it also talks about the early days of animation.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn animation basics, a lot of information for a great price, i hope this helps in your decision
B0054JZC6E|3.0|way to many ads. the ever other game full screen ad was a bit much. still fun to waste time while playing.
0142410705|4.0|I am not a math lover - but I loved nearly everything in this book (Including the math, nerdy appendix).<br /><br />Here's what I've come to love about John Green.  He makes nerd look AMAZINGLY COOL.  And I have to give him props for that.  He also makes the most amazing heroes out of kids that.. well, they aren't exactly easy hero material.<br /><br />An Abundance of Katherines is about Colin, a boy prodigy who dates only girls named Katherine, loves anagrams, and is pretty scared of not becoming a genius ... kinda.  Basically, he wants to make his mark in the world, something I think everyone can agree with.<br /><br />So after completing high school he sets out on a journey with his Muslim friend (who, by the way.. hilarious - yet again.  Love the sidekicks in Green's books).<br /><br />I cannot express how much this book tickled me, even with all of the math and the footnotes, which.. I admit, I kind of glazed over at times (with permission of the author of course!).<br /><br />Highly recommended for teenagers who think that being cool means you have to conform to a certain mold, and for adults who want to read a fun, interesting novel.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|absolutly love it. great way to pass time when thers nothing to do or watch. plus my four year old loves to play and watch the game.
0525478817|5.0|If perfection can be achieved in a book, then The Fault in Our Stars has achieved it.<br /><br />I am overwhelmed by how much this story affected me.  Even more so now that I'm studying many of the techniques used by John Green in writing this book.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I would ever feel compelled to pick up a story about a teenager who is struggling with terminal cancer, but John Green's name has carrying power, and so I did.  What I did not expect was the bittersweet humor that was injected into every. single. page.<br /><br />Seriously, for a book that (you would think) has a foregone conclusion (this is exactly what I thought when I picked it up - no spoiler here), would you expect to be laughing while wiping away tears?  I expected the tears, but not the laughter.<br /><br />Hazel's voice is so genuine that it gives me this pleasant pain in my heart to remember it.  I get the pain because I miss her.  She is someone I want to know, and I somewhat resent the fact that she is merely a figment of Green's imagination.  It isn't fair.<br /><br />What else isn't fair about this book is the brilliant method in which Green puts a book into the book, and the idea.. well, read the book.  I was astonished.  My jaw literally dropped. So, so brilliant.<br /><br />Filled with twists and turns - you cannot take any moment for granted in this beautiful book.  I highly recommend you check it out as soon as possible.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|I enjoy off the wall comedy, and this is perfect for people who want to watch some action, gore, cheesy comedy, and a bit of mystery and suspense.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These r GREAT games for all AGES! I have a 4 yr old and 7 yr old girls an they lug the games an so do I!! I recommend. this app to everyone!!!
B0073U2FB2|4.0|why all the bad reviews?  I think it's better than Haywire or Mission Impossible, and my husband feels the same.  I thought the effects were interesting, and there were constant surprises of a main character biting the dust. (get it? LOL)  Some holes in the script, but they didn't detract for us.  I'd recommend it if you like terminator-type movies.  As a side note, I loved seeing what Moscow actually looks like--the \\"living\\" city as opposed to the tourist areas.  I'd enjoy a sequel, but doubt it will be made after so many negative reviews.  =(
B002IFT1ZA|2.0|I, like others, have had issues with the media not working properly. I have the DVD release and have now had episode 7 on disc 4 about 10 minutes from the end episode cause all 4 different DVD players to skip over part of the episode. I even got a replacement disk and EXACTLY the same issue occurred. HBO should stop wasting so much money on packaging and make a product that actually works.
B005LAIIS0|4.0|I guess people can't see beyond thier own expectations of things.  This movie is getting reviewed so hard because people feel like this is a bad surivior/horror film.  This film is a bad survivor/horror film because it isn't one.  This movie is steeped in very deep meaning, about mostly death and how people come to terms with it.  There is nothing nice and sun shinny about this movie at all.  I just can't beleive how many people reviewed this movie bad based on situations in the movie. There are moments in this movie that you wonder if they could really happen in real life, but for me they fit because thats not the point.  The point is about the meaning of the movie.  I enjoyed this movie alot, because I took an outside of the box approach with it.  Its a movie, that if you have people around you that watch movies, try to understand them, you can talk about it for awhile trying to figure out exactly the moral reasons for this movie.  Its not for everybody, about what we see in reviews 50/50.
0553381695|4.0|The series is GREAT--I am on the 2nd book and am having trouble getting anything elce done.  Amazon enabled<br />me to find and purchase the books in paperback and in the larger size by giving the dementions and # of pages,<br />allowing me to find the correct size first try.  Bought from Overstock-no book size or page # and had to return,<br />costing lots of wasted $.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|One of the Best albums I've heard in 10 years!<br />Great voice, inspired me to travel from DC to Canada to attend his concert!<br />Gregory Porter is GREAT!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My kids really enjoy strategically placing the animal homes and catching scrat.  So far they seem to like it.  The only parts they don't like are the things that require acorns because it takes forever to earn them. The littlest one likes learning the names of the different animals and making happy families but again, the acorns are an issue because he doesn't understand saving them up.  It would be great if there were more ways to earn them instead of buying them.
3836531038|5.0|this was a great book and if you are a fan of pictures taken by the ones in them then this is the book for you very interesting and a must buy for all.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think angry birds is one of the coolest games of the year it is totally awesome. I love this app it is so super and I recomend it for everyone.
0061743526|5.0|I have read the book about three times and have never gotten around to writing a review.  I guess it's about time.<br /><br />  The book takes place in Maycomb county, a small town in the 1930's.  Our narrator is Scout-an 8 year old living in a world of injustice, prejudice, and confusion.  The story seems very simple and technically it is.  However, it is a book with moral and meaning.  Many misadventures take place in the small town.  Mainly, the trial Scout's father decides to take on.  In it he decides to defend a black man in this judgmental community.  The book has a very controversial perspective.<br /><br />There's not much to be said about this classic that hasn't already been heard.  It really is a work of art that is truly an eye opener.<br /><br />This book means a lot to me and I know it does to others as well.  It literally is one of those books that can change someone's perspective or life.<br /><br />It's a book that I believe everyone should have a chance to read.
0938045768|5.0|I have been opposed to the so-called \\"functional strength\\" movement for a long time.  I was a State champion powerlifter in high school and college, and upon joining the military began doing \\"calisthenics\\" that were little more than flopping up and down as quickly as possible.  They made my joints hurt, but they never seemed to improve my physical condition.<br /><br />This book, on the other hand, presents calisthenics as a STRENGTH endeavor.  It gives me everything that I miss from powerlifting, and in what I believe to be a better format (I hesitate to use \\"functional strength\\", because I have seen that lable applied to a lot of nonsensical programs).<br /><br />My only caveat is that I don't use Mr. Wade's set/rep scheme; I do the excercises in a deck-of-cards workout.  I think that the smaller number of reps per set and larger number of sets will improve the neural training aspect of the workout.  Time will tell.
0385513755|4.0|Having read Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code before acquiring the illustrated edition, I found him to be a very vivid and descriptive writer.  This Illustrations made me feel like I was actually there.<br /><br />Not only was it nice to have the pictures available, I felt like I was more fully understand what was going on.  The story was much easier to follow with a visual A.  The photos are stunning and I enjoyed simply looking at them.<br />  It was interesting to have the pictures available considering the controversy of the book.  It allows a reader to take a look for himself and really decide how they feel about it.<br /><br />I very highly recommend that you purchase the illustrated edition.  It gives more thorough perspective and I believe that one can enjoy the novel to a fuller extent.
B005L38QHA|3.0|The SteelSeries World of Warcraft Legendary MMO Gaming Mouse is a comfortable mouse with lots of highly configurable button options, at least for WoW.  For comparison, I was previously using the venerable and excellent Logitech G5 gaming mouse, which I still love and use for all other games.<br /><br />The SteelSeries mouse has many more buttons, and has a nice pulsing illumination, which you can customize or completely turn off if you wish.  The four thumb buttons take a little while to get used to, and the placements of the key Buttons 4 and 5 are not that intuitive.  Button pressing is comfortable, but doesn't quite have that satisfying tactile \\"click\\" that I am used to.<br /><br />Players of WoW will enjoy using the mouse, but if WoW is not the only game you play, the other buttons typically don't work at all in other games.  For example, Star Wars: The Old Republic is not compatible with this mouse (although other people have posted a workaround by running the mouse driver with administrator privileges).<br /><br />After getting tired of swapping back and forth between mice, I end giving up on the SteelSeries mouse.
0545265355|5.0|I was hearing about the movie \\"Hunger Games\\" and I had never heard of the books.<br />I bought the boxed set  because I figured I should know the whole story.<br />I started reading the first book and realized I was enthralled.<br />I read them in the course of a few days (I had to eat and sleep, after all).<br />I highly recommend these books for the middle school and up crowd.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is great it keeps kids entertained for hours on road trips has stopped them from arguing all the time lol
1597801585|2.0|I really wanted to like this book because the premise sounded so interesting.  I normally like dystopian style books and I have a sense of wonder about what the future of this world will be.  I found most of the book tiresome and boring.  The only character I found I cared about at all was the Windup Girl herself.  She is introduced and the book starts to get more interesting but then falls flat on its face again.  It failed for me.  I stopped listening to my mp3 of it about 1/3 of the way.  I just couldn't take it anymore.  It was like torture.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've been going through countless apps on my Kindle Fire for several months now, but when I discovered Quell I realized it was in a class by itself. I'm not normally a puzzle guy - short attention span, I guess - but this one just keeps drawing me to dive back into it. It's so elegant, deceptively simple and easy to play, and you can go at your own speed, but it just keeps gently upping the complexity. Great game.<br /><br />PS Don't understand the recent comment about nagware because I've seen nothing, but I play it with Wi-Fi off so maybe that makes a difference.
B000FC12ZA|4.0|Easy read. It makes you reflect on your choices, your impact on the environment, the effect your choices have on the people you care most about, and rethink what is important to value in your life.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I use a kindle and I have had no problems. Even logging in through facebook or otherwise.  I love it, great game for almost all ages. As long as you know how to doodle.
0439023521|5.0|I was reserved about reading these books because of the topic of killing children.  After my (2) stepchildren read all three books and loved them I realized I should have an open mind and give them a chance. So our next book club I suggested the Hunger Games. I was hooked right away and read all three in 2 weeks.  The author did a wonderful job and all were smooth reading.  I liked that you did not know what was going to happen until the end of each book.  They are not just teen books.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love his game so much. I can talk with all my friends in my guild and have fun all day.
B006IGZX0C|4.0|This was a very enjoyable, entertaining, and informative movie.  Not quite as good as the hype, but still well worth watching.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All 3 books were a great read and each left you with a different emotion to ponder.  I liked the first book the best but the 2nd and 3rd books are not to be missed out as well.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this game is so easy to play.  I taught. my cousins child in acouple of minutes.  I like where the undo is. I play it when I cannot sleep. so the. large print helps when I do not have my glasses. I love this standard. version.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved reading about the ups and downs of the relationship between Anastasia and Christian. Well written novel and looking  forward to book two.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|First, I will say, that I am and always have been a Woody fan! But I must say that I was disappointed! Not sure why! Liked the story and the idea of it! Liked pretty much all of the actors!....I guess maybe I missed woody playing the lead!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|It's ok.  Not addictive like the others.  I usually look forward to playing but not with this game.  To me, it's just ok.
0446572993|3.0|I have read all of Baldacci's books and this is not one of his better ones. Strains credibility. I gave it 3 stars but most of his books are 4 or5 stars. Disappointed.
B007SGM084|5.0|I simply couldn't stop reading! Great collection! A bit expensive for an e version, but it was worth it! Enjoyed each book and I'm hoping for a fourth book!
B007SGM084|5.0|I haven't read the series yet...since I just downloaded them...the word of mouth reviews by my daughter, daughter in law and friends have set me up for success in my purchase! I will know in a couple of minutes. But after reading the other reviews I felt I needed to add my 2 cents in...I love using my iPad with the kindle app on it. I like to read in bed at night but don't want any lights turned on as my husband is a light sleeper so the e book on iPad, kindle etc is a fantastic solution for this. Also, I had shoulder surgerym4 weeks ago...I spent many nights in bed in pain reading my books while my husband slept away. This alone makes using the e book worth it's weight in gold.
B0063GORYU|5.0|relaxing way to pass the time.  no frustration with pigs laughing at you.  easy game to teach childred.  have fun.
0439023513|3.0|\\"Mockingjay\\" completes \\"The Hunger Games\\" series as Katniss Everdeen copes with the Quarter Quell aftermath.  While the storyline and survival techniques are  sufficiently thorough, I have trouble imagining the environment.  I pictured a utopian lifestyle for those in the Capitol but the encounters at the end contradicted my impressions.  I have mixed feelings over the conclusion, on one side it seemed rushed but on the other I was glad to have Katniss's constant chaos and indecision over.  I kept reminding myself she's only seventeen though.  I believe Haymitch may have been the more fascinating character to follow.<br /><br />I cautiously recommend the series to any fan of the survival action genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|It is a story that keeps you reading even when your shocked, sad, happy and even irritated with what is unfolding in the story, it is a brilliant book and every book after that in the trilogy, could not put it down. worth the irratable husband for for a little while. :)
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I am so glad that Santana got away from Clive Davis long enough to make a real Santana album. They are not kidding when they say \\"20 years in the making.\\" I was really beginning to think that \\"Santana,\\" as such, was a thing of the past, but Shape Shifter came along and saved the day. Think about it, Carlos Santana is pushing 70 and we are still able to review a brand new real Santana album. What a blessing. All I can say is, at 55, I have been along for the ride sinse \\"Live at the Fillmore 1967\\" and I have waited a long time for this. Forget the silly 2 and 3 star reviews. Run after this disc, then, tell us what you think. Thanks Carlos, for a lifetime of great rock and roll music!!!
B004LWZW24|5.0|First off this movie is so scary I couldn't sleep last night I felt like somebody was watching me I was fearful Lol<br />I said Never Again This movie is Something else I tell you the truth I was tossing and turning all night when I tried too sleep
B006PAZMMK|1.0|This is the worst music to exist in the history of music.  If you like this music, I have to believe that you have a mental deficiency.  A person with an IQ could not possibly hear this and think \\"I want to listen to this all the time\\".<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you like this album, you are stupid.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Really fun game!  I feel like I can actually play the game and earn game money over time to upgrade items (rather than the game requiring actual money in order to make any real progress).  Very enjoyable game to play!
B003NFM3JK|4.0|I read A Christmas Carol when I was a kid. It was an abridged version, if I recall. So I am familiar with the story, not the book. I was watching the special features on this movie, and they were talking about how this book, even though it was written so long ago, really lends itself well to the animation process, because there are so many things actors can't physically do. And, this is the most faithful adaptation ever. Of course, if you watch the special features on any movie, even one that got horrible reviews, you will hear the actors and backstage people brag about how well they interpreted everything, what a fine cast they had, how perfectly it all came about, etc.<br /><br />Well, I did enjoy the movie. I enjoyed the animation. I can't really say how faithful it was to the book because I read it too long ago. But the basic story seemed to be there. Scrooge's change from penny-pinching to generous seemed a little abrupt to me. It seemed more from fear than learning. I can agree that they did things that were physically impossible and needed animation for. But then I wonder... why did they use motion capture? They had to set up all those weird contraptions to move around the actors, and then animate most of it anyway. Doesn't that just make it all a lot harder? Like doing it twice? They said (bragged) in the special features that using all the dots on the actors' faces allowed them to capture all the nuances of the actors' expressions. But then, animators on regular computer-animated movies are pretty proud of the expressions they come up with for their characters, too. I don't really get it. Their characters didn't look any more expressive then characters in movies like Shrek. I think they just made more work for themselves. But what the heck. The actors said it was a lot of fun.<br /><br />Well anyway, I enjoyed WATCHING the movie. I didn't get to see the 3-D version. I'm not a Christmas Carol aficionado with tons of things to compare it to. And I didn't have any little kids to scare. So it was a fun diversion.any little kids to scare. So it was a fun diversion.
B00701897I|5.0|Excellent movie and is a very good idea the distribution of theses items in them main three formats.... BR3d - BRD - DVD<br />[[ASIN:B0034G4P4Y The Adventures of Tintin (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)]]
B004UID2LC|5.0|love it. insread of having to buy songs, i can just download them with this app! :D five plus stars
B0079R8IYW|4.0|I like this cover a lot. The kindle Fire slips into the cover perfectly and the screen is framed by it. There is an inside pocket and credit card slots and the stand feature in this case also works well. It is a lightweight very smooth leather finish. The only negative I could say is that finger marks show up very easily, but so far have been easily wiped away, but my daughters greasy prints after eating pizza took a while to disappear. Highly reccomended.
0920236251|5.0|This story is absolutely fabulous.  My daughter and sons all love it.  When I signed on to Amazon to buy a copy, at first I was going for the regular Paperback version (~six dollars), but then I saw a $1.99 version and bought it instead.<br /><br />Big mistake.  It's a pocket sized book...smaller than an index card in size.  I didn't realize that--although in hindsight, I should have wondered why it was so cheap. :)  It's in color, though--so that's a nice surprise.  Just way too small.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|This was just an okay book for me.  It revealed who the murderer was as soon as it happened, and never really got deeply into proving it.  The whole story was told by the dead girl watching the relationships of her family from her heaven. It lacked excitement.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Its great and entertaining the only problem I have with it is that you have to check it about everyday but I still love it.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a good app because the number are big for you to see them and I like the idea it keeps the last amount.  Great on my kindle fire!!!!!
0345803485|1.0|On page 9 and the writing is so horrible, pretentious, and the author right clicks the mouse every other word to the thesaurus to sound extra douchey and to feign intelligence.  I am kicking myself for buying all three at once. The erotic part better not disappoint!
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Mommy porn.  Don't waste your time or money.  The story is stupid and the writing is terrible.  Appears the author just wanted to cash in on loney moms.
0345803507|4.0|I'm going to start by saying that I really loved this trilogy and I recommend you read all 3 books. It's a journey. It's gripping. Scary. Emotionally charged and everything else in between. That being said, I'm giving this one 4 stars because there is a turn this book took that I was hoping did not take place. And although the events following this turn were beautiful, it was still a road I wish this particular story did not travel. So I cannot give my 5 star rating.<br /><br />Now on all other fronts this last installment does not disappoint. We finally get straight answers from Christian! More understanding and insight to this delectable complicated beautiful man. I was so pleased for the most part of how this one turned out. How things were brought to a close a put to rest. This trilogy took me well passed my comfort zone but caused me to want to stay surrounded by my discomfort. This trilogy was that addicting to me. Ms. James I feel, told a very raw, real story.<br /><br />All 3 books will have you shocked, angry, happy, sad, aroused and on edge. Experiencing emotions that have yet to be defined maybe? You name it. So as I said, yes I would recommend this read. I recommend this trilogy. Enjoy!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I downloaded this to my phone since I don't own an actual Kindle. I like to read while waiting in doctors' offices, etc, and my phone works great for this. So far, this version looks great. No need to comment on the book itself, everyone knows that Wuthering Heights is a classic that can be read over and over.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is super fun and awesome I regimens you get it oh and the only thing you add on to it is cars for. each family yu know in then you could upgrade the cars and you should put some ice snipes.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its pretty cool its just very simple and not very mind exercising. no problems though except for all the ads.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It wasn't amazing. The author could've done WAY more with it. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over, and although it did have some interesting things about it, such as Mr. Grey's dark past and the relationship between him and Ana, eventually I was just bored. It was mostly the poor writing that ruined it for me, because it seemed like it had a lot of potential when I read the summary. Anyway, even though I did finish this first book, I will not be reading the second or third parts of this trilogy, as I do not feel it was money well spent.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty Shades of Stupid.  I wish I didn't purchase all 3 books at one time on my kindle.  The author needs to take \\"writing 101\\".  Just bad.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I just got this. The E6 enabled me to do just what I wanted. I had very little volume coming from my headphones, when using my PC. Now, I have as much as I wanted, plus some nice bass.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow!! Before this book went viral a few friends recommended it to me. I began reading the series and imediately became... what's the word? Oh yes, OBSESSED!! No man (in real life) will ever come close to that masculine, overbearing, controlling, yet so freakin sexy Christian Grey! ::sigh:: Haha Yes, yes, I know... it's jussst a book. But that's the kind of series this is, you just can't seem to get enough. By the time I got to book two I couldn't stop reading. As soon as book two ended I was left thinking \\"WTF?!\\" and immediately jumped into book number three (at like 3am)! Yes it's THAT good! I definitely recommend this book to everyone (guys included). It will spice up your sex life and pull that inner Dom from within. I promise you, your boyfriends/girlfriends, husbands/ wives will thank you later! ;)
B00723NWJE|4.0|Not the best album, kind of depressing at times. Although I really missed what she did with her first album. However this is an interesting attempt at something different. I found Happy pills and Miriam very good happy pills being a bit up beat and Miriam a total spacey tune. As for the other tracks they are so-so and don't seem like much was put into them. I hope Norah will release something like her first couple albums which I still can listen too and be blown away by. However, I am not sure I would recommend the entire album... Just get a few tastes on youtube to see if you want to buy it. Overall I was looking for old Norah but I guess musicians are always changing, this is one of those times. Final note her vocals are still great and put her voice to great use.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I look forward to reading all the books in this series.  I can't believe how true the series is to the dialogue from the books...I'm enjoying reading, even though I know what is to come in the future, however, the writing clarifies the experience for me.  The beauty of the HBO film is intensified by the book.
B004WQ1Z0C|5.0|If you haven't delved into the world of Harry Potter, you should. This is a great film. I had to purchase again after someone ran mine over. Quality is awesome, and the story is fantastic!

B000EULJLU|5.0|Beautiful art, both on the cover and inside, stereoscopic lenses provided for viewing the images in 3D.  Wonderful music including really good songs like:  Vicarious, Wings for Marie (parts 1 and 2,) the  Pot, Jambi and Right in Two - Probably the best overall album from Tool.  The seller sent everything perfectly, on-time and undamaged :)

B0013O123Q|2.0|The movie starts at the end and goes backwards. Its like an art film but NOT a horror movie!It has a couple violent scenes in it, including a disturbing rape scene but this movie is not scary at all.The camera work made me dizzy, and was done for effect. If you are looking for a violent movie about revenge, check out the \\"I spit on your Grave\\" remake starring Sarah Butler. \\"Irreversible\\" is a hodge podge of visual images that attempts to turn rape and revenge into artistic cinematic statements. It doesn't have much of a  plot and there is no character development. This movie might have gotten a 3 star rating or better if it had a cohesive plot. It isn't total trash but I didn't enjoy it.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|Review of \\"Bared To You\\" by Sylvia Day<br /><br />I enjoyed this well-written book and found it difficult to put down. As a result I finished it fairly quickly. The chemistry between the main characters, Gideon and Eva, was smoking from the jump. Although the book began as a typical \\"boy wants girl\\" storyline, as we get to know more about the characters we see their relationship is anything but typical.<br />Throughout the story, as heartbreaking as it is to see characters attempt to destroy each other, it really describes reality and what to expect in the very real world of love and maintaining relationships. The baggage the characters bring into the story heavily impacts how much their desire to slay their demons walks a fine line with just wanting to run away and say \\"forget it.\\"<br />A supporting character, Cary, is delightful throughout the book, yet, as he begins his own journey toward love, he appears hell bent on sabotaging anything good in the romance department. It hurt my heart to see the struggle he faced and how much he declined as the book progressed.<br />I am not sure I liked how much Gideon remains even platonically involved with past and wanna-be-loves, it is almost as if he enjoys baiting Eva by maintaining regular contact and conversations with them. Although he proclaims both with his physical actions, as well as his words, he is \\"with\\" Eva, I'm not all convinced he needs to care so much about the women in his past just to try to appease them, or spare their feelings. Especially when he knows how much it upsets Eva, who is irrationally jealous and makes that fact very well known on several occasions.<br />I really enjoyed the fact that Ms. Day writes a story that many people can readily identify with because in the real world, fairytales do not exist and love takes work. However, it was easy to get swept up in wanting to live the life of a billionaire, like Gideon, and thinking how much easier that would make things. Which, let's face it, most people are not only dealing with the toughness of intimacy, they are also dealing with financial issues that add to the real world stress on relationships. Our characters in Bared To You have the luxuries most of us only daydream about.<br />The sex scenes are plentiful and explicit, so, you get your money's worth just in those alone. Although I was not fond of certain terms, words, or a means to describe passionate acts in Bared To You, those were strictly my personal preferences. For example, I do not normally like using the term \\"her sex...\\" to describe a woman's most intimate orifice, but, that is solely my penchant. Although, in defense of writing erotic fiction, it becomes quite difficult to find creative ways to accurately describe in clear detail, without repeating oneself, any part of anatomy, act, or description of passionate interludes. Ms. Day does successfully spin a deliciously enticing image of characters entwined truly aching from desire.<br />I recommend this book to anyone interested in erotic fiction. It's a great place to start no matter if you are new to the genre, or have several book notches in your bedpost. I look forward to the continuation as the ending left us with several important questions about each of the characters. A romantic cliffhanger for sure.eople are not only dealing with the toughness of intimacy, they are also dealing with financial issues that add to the real world stress on relationships.

B000WMEAKC|4.0|Bought this album because I listened to it in a friend's car. The song \\"Apologize\\" doesn't have Timbaland on it which is fine, because I don't listen to that song anyway. The whole album seemed very cohesive, and the sounds is pop. Maybe coffee-shop pop. I couldn't definitely hear this playing in a Starbucks. Ryan Tedder's voice and melodies on this album are catchy without being over produced. Overall, a solid debut.<br /><br />Favorite songs on the album:<br />Say<br />Stop & Stare<br />Prodigal
B003V4AK8E|3.0|I received the controller within agreed time and the first thing I did was charge it and started using it.<br /><br />Pros<br />-The conroller feels just like an Xbox controller<br />-It has plastic grips on the handles, which feel very nice (and helpful for those gamers who get sweaty palms)<br />-It has a nice little feature where you can have all your buttons light up red.<br /><br />Cons<br />This first con is something I was really disappointed in, and made me seriously consider using my Dualshock ps3 controller when I played online.<br />-In order to use this controller, you literally have to be in direct contact with the usb dongle connected to the ps3, otherwise you will lose connection (I don't have to tell you what this means when you're playing COD online and your controller suddenly stops working for a couple of seconds)<br /><br />As of right now I use he controller when playing uncharted 2 or Assassins creed etc. (No First person shooters or Online gaming) But I would still recommend it if you're more of a leisure gamer and play games.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it!!! Very good Story line and character imaging. I had to buy the second and third book this one was so good.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|With this sweet little program, you can grab videos off Youtube and save them on your storage card for offline viewing.  This includes videos that say &quot;not available for mobile&quot;, by the way.  There are plenty of multipart video sets that I've grabbed this way.  In fact, that's how I was introduced to some of my favorite comedians, whose podcasts I now enjoy!  Try searching for &quot;statutory rape rock&quot; by Adam Carolla. :-)
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's dumb, but fun.  You can learn to play it instantly.  The only problem is it's addictive. A lot of entertainment for the price.
B002SEW5WW|3.0|My favorite song on this album is \\"Secrets\\" but the rest of the songs don't really do it for me. I liked their first album a lot more. There aren't really any other songs with a great hook, and they all kind of bleed together.

0307592731|4.0|I loved this book...in spite of myself. Ms. Strayed and I are such polar opposites politically, religiously and culturally, that my rigid 'Wally Cleaver'-self was not supposed to care for her 'Janis Joplin'-esque journey of discovery and healing. But BAM! But there I was - recoiling, for sure, but turning pages like an addict.<br /><br />The shared, rock-solid, fundemental foundation which permitted our unlikely connection is our mutual and overwhelmingly emotional affection for the natural splendor that is Oregon & California. I've stood on outcroppings of the Pacific Crest Trail, most notably along the Eagle Creek (Oregon) alternate route, and was rocked to my core by the majesty of what my eyes beheld. I've stood on the rim of Crater Lake and had to force back tears. There literally is no adequate spoken language to describe the rapturous splendor that power-surges your senses, and certainly, there is no sufficient method by which to react to what just hit you.<br /><br />But the author and I connected in another way, too. Ms. Strayed is real. Her unguarded vulnerability and expressions thereof make this read very, very personal and, for me, richly, richly rewarding.<br /><br />I'd also like to echo (at least) one of the other reviewers. Fear not; this is not a 'hiking' book.<br /><br />What this book IS, is an ultra-intimate journal of a young, troubled woman who voluntarily jumped head-first off a sheer precipice into the seemingly bottomless chasm of 'what-do-I-have-to-lose'?<br /><br />I envy you for not having read this book yet and for the experience you're about to have. I'm sad for me that I can't rush out and instantly find another book to duplicate the joy I experienced in reading Ms. Strayed's masterpiece.
0525422943|5.0|I liked but didn't love If I Stay. I got all the hype, it was written well, etc. but it was just so \\"nice!\\" Nice characters, nice family, nice friends, everything. But because I was looking for a new book, and read the first one, I figured why not give it a try. I'm so glad I did! Finally the characters have flaws! And things aren't perfect! Yeah!! I really, really enjoyed this book, loved seeing how their relationship fell apart and changed and who they became when they were apart. I also really liked this taking place in one day, it made it all seem that much more urgent.<br /><br />I think it would be really hard to read this if you haven't read If I Stay, but if you have you should definitely give this a try.
B000H1RFKA|3.0|Good buy, disc was brand new, not too much for special features but a great flick that's fun too watch.

B002U0KHMY|4.0|This show is about Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer), a sexy con man, who strikes a deal with FBI agent Peter Burke (Tim Dekay), to spend the rest of his prison sentence working as a consultant to help the FBI catch white collar criminals. (Think Frank Abignail, Catch Me if You Can) The show is great because it intertwines Caffrey's work with the FBI into Caffrey's other mission, to find his ex girl friend, Kate.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this show is it doesn't take itself too seriously, like other crime dramas. The relationship between Caffrey and Burke is great, they really bring you into their world.<br /><br />The other great thing about this show is the way the two of them solve crimes. It's smart and innovative. Add a little Mozzie (think Monk) and Peter's Wife, Elizabeth (Tiffani Thiesen, the fantastic and still gorgeous Kelly Kapowski), and you have a great combination!<br /><br />If you don't want to buy the DVD, you can watch it on Netflix, but pre-warned, you're going to be addicted.
0240815807|5.0|What's so important about EQ? How do you get your vocals to sound \\"professional\\"? Why the hype about room treatment?<br />Mike senior answers these questions and more in this excellent volume. He walks you step by step through the song production process and covers everything the home producer wants to know in extensive detail. Subjects range from picking nearfield monitors to the importance of phase and ethical compression in the mix. The reading can become a bit cumbersome at times, but that doesn't diminish the book's overall appeal. Mike definitely knows what he's doing and is more than happy to provide examples and sound files all tailored to the needs of the aspiring home producer. As one who's just starting out myself, I can personally attest to the usefulness of this volume. A fine fit for anyone in the music industry.
0525423281|3.0|I listened to the audio narration done of this novel and it was well done.  But the story just fell mostly flat for me, even though there were peaks of the story that I really liked.  I enjoyed the first 1/3 of Lola and I think this story would have made a decent novella, I don't think there is enough storyline to fill an entire book, however.  I found it hard to always sympathize with or understand why Lola was so upset.  I just didn't think her parent situation was that upsetting. But, other things were dealt with well.  I continue to think that Stephanie Perkins deals well with conflicting and competiting emotions and the confusion of being in one relationship but wanting to be in another relationship.<br /><br />It was sweet to see Anna and St. Claire, but while they were so sweet they were just too perfect.  They made me jealous!  I also found it hard to accept that college students would go out of their way to hang out with a high school student no matter how interesting she dresses.  Crikett, the \\"hero\\" of the story, is yes very lovable and attractive but a little too perfect.<br /><br />If you are expecting another Anna and the French Kiss, Lola is not that.  But it is a decent young adult romance and angst novel if you are willing to accept some plot holes and leaps.  Otherwise, it is sweet.  I would recommend reading the story v. listening, as in the end I am not sure I enjoyed listening (but the narration was okay so I can't blame it on the narrator).
014241543X|4.0|I kept reading this book, which is saying something because I usually stop if I'm not liking a story. I liked the characters and the story, but there was something I couldn't put my finger on that kept me from giving this five stars. Everything just felt too NICE. The boyfriend is perfect, the family is perfect, the friends are perfect. The story was like a constant simmer as opposed to a boil. That said, I did finish it and I would recommend it, everyone's taste is different!
B006RUJST6|1.0|This book was ridiculous.  The story was horribly unbelievable and just BORING! The guy (I don't even remember his name) was a pathetic, spineless wimp, and the girl, Lake, was....ridiculous.  I got sooo sick off all of the Avett Brothers crap and thought the idea of dressing up as lung cancer because your mom is dying from it one of the most retarded things ever written!<br />I really wanted to enjoy this book, but I didn't.  I don't understand the 5 star ratings this book has received.  This book was pathetic.

0670022411|5.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It captured my imagination with an intellectual premise and kept my interest throughout for the fantasy and romantic adventures.
0345803485|4.0|This is not a typical romance, though it is a love story of sorts. The heroine, Anastasia Steele, is a naive virgin when she meets the protagonist Christian Grey hence those 'Shades of Grey' which serves as a metaphor for the dark, sexual side of Mr. Grey and his attempts to tone down the sex to something more normal for Ana. Not surprisingly, the naive virgin in Ana goes bye,bye really fast and Ana gets reeled in by the dominating and domineering Grey. Kinky sex ensues.<br />Ultimately, this is a borderline porn tome that is greatly redeemed by very good prose which moves at a decent pace and avoids the redundancy that is often amplified in the context of a romance. To legitimize this story and also justify all the graphic sex, the author has Ana wondering what in Grey's life has influenced his sexual preferences/perversions. I have to admit that I felt the same way and wanted to understand Grey, too.<br />Maybe it's general lack of estrogen on my part, but what initially seems risky and exciting and interesting at times also seemed sort of old and tired and stalled in sort of an inevitable sameness.<br />I can totally understand why most 20 somethings would love this book and its sequels if only for the huge jolts of sex, but  this is actually a good story beyond the sex.<br />If you are interested in exploring the dark side of sex, this book is going to grab you hard and take you for a ride. It is hard to put down and achieves what every good book should: it grabs its readers full attention.

I usually don't write reviews, but when a product is clearly superior to all the competition, then it's worth the effort.

0525478817|5.0|I've read all of John Green's books and this is absolutely my favorite so far. For what could have been a depressing topic this book made me laugh and smile and I never knew what was going to happen next - and these are characters who are teminally sick! I mean, you KNOW what will inevitably happen, so how did he keep me turning the pages? Because he's awesome and this book is amazing and you should totally read it.
0812550706|4.0|I rate books on a scale of 1-10, where 1 is terrible, 5 is an average book that's usually still worth a read, and 10 is a book that breaks on you like a religious experience. Very few books, in my opinion, would warrant a \\"9\\" or \\"10\\".<br /><br />Writing Quality: 6/10.<br />I read a lot of Card's novels when I was a kid, and loved them. As an adult, I still love them, but I'm a little more discerning about what Card's inadequacies may be. They're not glaring inadequacies. His actual ability as a wordsmith (in this novel, at least) is above average, just not the bright spot of the novel. He doesn't get bogged down in character monologue or philosophical musing, (see Terry Goodkind's Wizard's First Rule for a whole lot of both), but keeps his writing fairly simple, straightforward, and focused on the action. If you really want stuff to get bogged down in philosophical musing, wait for the third book in the series, Xenocide.<br /><br />Depth of Concept: 7/10.<br />There are those who hate Ender's Game. Not many, but those who do claim that Card romanticizes violence, or that he is out of touch with the way real children behave and respond to adult situations. I think a person could make a case for those things, but I think that Card's characterization of violence, war, leadership, and \\"necessary evil\\" are respectably nuanced, and that his descriptions of gifted children are not wildly unbelievable. Even if they were a little out of place, I think that the scenario Card dreams up in which children fill roles normally reserved for adults during wartime provides a clever allegory that has helped me and a lot of other readers to rethink the ways that wars are conducted. It's no surprise that a variety of military institutions, as well as school classrooms, have used Ender's Game as course reading material. For being a source of multiple meaningful interpretations, I put its depth of concept even higher than George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones (which I gave a 6/10), which is no slouch itself when it comes to depictions of war.<br /><br />Rounded Characters: 7/10.<br />I considered scoring this a \\"6,\\" because I was concerned that maybe I just liked a lot of the characters, which is different than them being particularly realistic and nuanced. Still, I think that Ender, the protagonist, struggles with legitimately difficult situations, and does so with a personality and motivation that felt both distinct and well-developed. Not all of the other characters are as well detailed; some are merely likeable side-kicks, and some are sort of generic authority figures. Still, I thought Card set up some really interesting dynamics between his siblings and his mentors. I'm looking at my review for A Game of Thrones, which I scored a \\"6\\" in this category, and second-guessing myself...but for now I suppose I'll leave the score as it stands.<br /><br />Well-Developed World: 7/10.<br />Card does a good job of detailing the particulars of the world, particularly the battle school. While you'd never confuse Card's writing for hard science, he does a good job of explaining the limits of technological possibility in his futuristic world, and of describing the wartime situation that makes the battle school and other military services be what they are. It's easy to get immersed in Card's descriptions of tactics, both in the battle school and in the real-time scenarios, and that's a task that lesser authors might botch.<br /><br />Page Turner: 9/10.<br />Definitely. As I write this, I wonder if I should have bumped it up to a perfect \\"10\\" for being a page-turner. Perhaps the only reason that I don't is that I rarely felt that the stakes were so high that I feared for characters; really, very few bad things happen to the likeable main characters in the book. In that sense, it's more like an episode of MASH (without the comedy) than Saving Private Ryan. I'm sure there's a better example to use, but I hope you get the picture. Also, I found scenes involvingEnder and the battle school somewhat more engaging than the scenes with his siblings.<br /><br />Kept Me Thinking: 6/10.<br />Despite what I think is a clever use of allegory and thought-provoking wartime scenarios involving virtual realities and machiavelian questions about whether the ends justify the means, I still was mostly reading this to have an action-packed good time. Others may feel they were able to be a lot more introspective during and after reading...but frankly, I spent about as much time thinking really critically about the novel just now writing the review as I did during and after reading. Not because there isn't worthwhile stuff to think about...but because it's packaged in such a quick, slick, entertaining read.<br />___________________________________________________<br /><br />Overall Recommendation: 7/10.<br />Ender's Game won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards when it was released, which is quite rare even for award-winning fantasy and science fiction novels. It's better than a lot of books that have won those awards, though perhaps not the best (I gave Red Mars an overall recommendation of 8/10 because of its immensely nuanced and extremely intelligent and useful look at colonization, though I'll concede that Ender's Game is much more fun to read). Still, if you want a super-engaging science fiction novel to read, that you can still have a reasonably intelligent discussion about afterwards with your friends or book group, it would be hard to do a lot better than this. It's not as earth-shattering as Moby-Dick or The Road by a long shot...but I need some quick reads in-between big emotional undertakings like those. This one fits the bill. I'm going to leave it at a \\"7,\\" but it possibly deserves an \\"8\\" for the simple reason that huge numbers of readers (not just science-fiction and fantasy aficionados) cite it as one of their favorite books of all time.

1401235417|5.0|I have read million of Batman comics, but most of them have never appealed to me. Almost all used to have psychotic villains. Batman was forced to unnecessarily go through one tragedy after next. Even the character of Bruce Wayne wasn't that perfect.<br />But , now  Scott Synder seems to have developed the perfect Batman.  He doesn't brood always , as before. Hell, we can even see him smile once or twice in the initial issues! Bruce Wayne, is shown more like an optimistic businessman and philanthropist who wants to do good for Gotham, not just a playboy.<br />Batman finds that,as events develop, that a clandestine organization called the \\"Court of Owls\\" have been active in Gotham since the city came into existence. The Court wants to kill Bruce Wayne for its own reasons and then , obviously, Batman also gets involved.<br />Characterization is excellent. Lot of twists and turns and jaw-dropping moments. Hats-off to Snyder for providing readers with such an entertaining book.<br />This is the first time I'm reading a Synder book and I must I enjoyed it immensely! I had bought this book just because of so many positive reviews when the individual issues were released. And now I know why bat-fans are going crazy. This is the BEST batman I have ever read. This is that Batman book which puts all the other bat-books to shame. I was really fed of all the usual sadistic and psychopath-based stories that used to dog the Batman series.  Too many supporting characters also, sometimes. And always there used to be a darkness around the bat-comics. But, this..this is just PERFECT. There seems to be new \\"zing\\" to Batman , starting from the first page itself. He doesn't have that grim, brooding look. Also, he has upgraded his tech. The gadgets he now uses are just too good. This is the best re-launch BAtamn could ever get. In fact, I wasn't happy with the DC relaunch in general but I'm glad that at least the Batman one is brilliant!<br />Art by Capullo is awesome. In the first few issues, Batman looks very bold, confident. Then In the last few issues, when he is captured by the Court, then he looks really run-down and frustrated. Meaning to say, Capullo is too good with facial expressions, among other things.<br />Once I started reading, I just couldn't stop until I reached the last page. The next one would be the \\"Night of Owls\\" ..eagerly waiting for that!
B001VEHZZ2|5.0|One of those books I didn't think I'd like from the title, having no particular interest in Islam or politics.<br />But I was immediately drawn into it. The leading character, Changez, is addressing an American he meets in a Lahore teashop (and by extension you the reader.) Hamid never lets you forget you're being 'talked at' rather than reading an autobiography; Changez regularly asks questions or makes polite comments to his American (although the latter's voice is never heard.)<br />Changez begins his narrative when he was a student in the US. As an outstanding Pakistani youth he got a scholarship to Princeton. Here religion doesn't seem to feature in his life at all- he aims high, mixes with his classmates, drinks, holidays, falls in love and ultimately lands a prestigious job.<br />But cracks start to emerge in his American persona:<br />'I was a modern day janissary, a servant of the American empire at a time when it was invading a country with a kinship to mine.'<br />Unputdownable.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am one of the many who find it hard to believe this book is actually a bestseller. its not the story line that bothers me or that its \\"erotica\\" which i don't really think it is, i mean i have read regular romance books that are heavier in that department, but its the low quality of writing. I mean, there are just too many of the same words used too often, and it just got annoying after awhile. And secondly it was obvious the writer is from across the pond because of the way somethings were worded or that these people drank flippin tea ll the time. I love tea and i don't even drink it that much!<br /><br />But in case you don't know the story line, Anastasia Steele is a college student who fills in for her best friend to interview self made millionaire, Christian Grey. The two hit it off right away, him becoming completely lovestruck by this super ordinary (in every way) girl, he pretty much becomes her stalker and then they decide to \\"date\\" only he wants her to be his submissive, aka sex slave. Because not only is he \\"super hott\\" he is also super kinky in the sex department, being sexually abused as a teenager himself. There really isnt much of a story beyond that, basically just them working out the arrangements for their sex contract and also him deciding he wants more than just sex with her, for some reason he cant explain...blah...blah...blah....<br /><br />i would advise waiting till the price drops drastically on these books or borrow them form a friend if you must find out for yourself, because there not worth the money. and if your looking for some hott love story with some hott love scenes you wont find them in here. i would rate this book a \\"G\\" version of Erotica!
B000001Y2U|5.0|I feel sorry for kids now that cant experience this album as I did in 96 before the internet. Back then this guy was really shocking. Now with the internet you can watch snuff films just at the click of key. I still remember the look the cashier game me when I bought this back then.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Decent version of spider solitaire. Convenient interface. Ads are a bit annoying but you can remove with a touch. Responsive.
B005DC68NI|5.0|David's done a great job and provided a much needed service for those of us starting down the path of self publishing.  He combines strong rationale, some easy to follow steps, practical resource tips and I loved the case studies.

B0067R0APK|5.0|I like it. It seems to have accurate weather predictions, so it lives up to its name. Graphics are great, too.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|enjoy playing every game. great game to pass time and challenge your skills as a gamer. would recomend to all my friends.
0307352145|5.0|The author really prepared well for presenting so many important facts about introverts and the world in which they live. The dynamics of a society with all types of school children,  coworkers, colleagues, and even social relationships introverts have a very important place. ...and for all these years I just thought I was socially clumsy. Wish this book had been written when I was a teenager, or when his kindergarten teacher wanted to hold my (now grown up and very successful) son back because he didn't speak up. Very well written, extremely informative, organized book presenting all three personality types and how they contrast and complement one another.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Has anyone actually paused and slowly gone through the pictures in the opening credits?  Would recommend!  I have all four seasons and I can't wait for the 5th to come out.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was the most thought provoking book I have ever read.  I thought about it for days after reading it.  What would I do if I were in this situation.  I have recommended it to my friends.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|this book was well written and continued to keep your interest throughout the book.  it had unexpected twists and<br />turns until the very end
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I play this all the time!! my daughter even plays it too and she's only two and pretty goof at it. simple fun.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Didn't care for this at all.  Perhaps some women are into being submissives to a dominant male who likes to hurt them.  Where I'm at in my life there's nothing interesting or appealing about that lifestyle.
B0036EBARO|5.0|I'd say Head First and Seventh Tree are their top albums.. both very different but both very well done. As most have mentioned, Head First as an album seems more like an 80s pop tribute, but it's a very strong tribute! Personally I feel like the melodies all flow very nicely and I love to sing along with almost every song. If you hate 80s music (though really, how can anyone hate 80s music... so much of it was good!), then you *might* not like this album, but I'd still recommend giving it a try. Now that I have it as a CD I'm sorely tempted to buy the vinyl version.
B0070TEH08|5.0|When we went on a short vacation I neglected to record this series that my wife loves. Thanks to Amazon for the opportunity to stream the series when we returned and keep me out of the dog house.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|I got this set even though I was a little skeptical about the price to piece ratio (~400 pcs. for $60 is not very good) but I was blown away by the set. The build is great, features nice landscaping and a cool technique to create the curved wall. The minifigures are awesome and it features two of the new lego horses! I heartily recommend this set for Lego fans and LotR fans alike!!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This is such a beautiful story.  Too often movies are made all about sex, but this is more about the journey to acceptance.  This was very well done and very believable.  The dialogue was very casual and volumes were spoken with the character's eyes.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film and recommend it to anyone and everyone, regardless of your sexual preference.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game sucks because it doesn't give out any hints... u just have to tap around the screen and hope to get Lucky..  this should have been free!!!!!!!!!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I love the Disney Princess Wall Decals. It add some more elegant and class to my 5 year old daughter bedroom. We recently, purchased her a new bed room suit, a Disney Princess Comforter and the Tinkerbell Comforter. And, I needed to purchase some sticker/wall decals for more decorations for her room. And, these Disney Princess Wall Decals was the perfect thing to purchase for her room. My daughter loves the stickers and everybody who comes to see her room loves it too. They also works very well and they stay on the walls. The wall decals do not come off the walls. That's another thing I love about these Disney Princess Wall Decals. Thanks!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|good game. response is good. wish I had more control over slashes. allies are little weak. all in all it's a great game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I found this game very unique. I recommend you get this game for your kindle.101 games in one is an excellent idea for a game.
B0063IH60K|5.0|good game I enjoy playing it. I like the graffics too. I like how u can play for awhile and then come back to it later
0307352145|5.0|This is a wonderful book for anyone who thinks they're introverted, who loves an introvert, or  if you're interested in personality psychology. Susan Cain does a wonderful job of exploring our \\"extroverted ideal\\" society and the differences and strengths of both introverted and extroverted personalities.<br /><br />As an introvert myself, similar to many of the people described in this book, I often was made to feel that there is something wrong with me if I am not comfortable with the types of social interaction and \\"charisma\\" that society pushes us to believe we must have in order to succeed and be respected. This book made me feel accepted, understood, and valuable for my strengths as an introverted individual.<br /><br />My favorite parts of the book came toward the end when Cain explores the \\"communication gap\\" between extroverts and introverts when they must work (or live) together, particularly in romantic relationships. I could really identify with the couple that she describes in detail (introverted wife, extroverted husband) and the issues that arise due to personality differences. It was wonderful how she explored ways in which the two personality types complement each other and how they can work on compromising so they are both happy. I also enjoyed the chapter on dealing with introverted children, especially in the school classroom. I was an introverted child, and I have strong memories of some serious anxiety about certain activities and situations at school. I also work with children in a classroom setting and I can easily pick out those kids that react to things a bit differently, because they remind me of myself. Cain offers a great explanation of how these children can flourish in the classroom, and gives helpful advice to both parents and teachers for how to help these quiet kids thrive and not be overlooked.<br /><br />A wonderful book, easy to read (no fancy psych language, and everything is thoroughly explained), with a great use of \\"case studies\\" to give names and faces to what is being described. Many psychological research studies are cited to back up all of the information that is presented. Overall, a fascinating read for anyone who can relate or who is interested in this sort of topic.
0345803485|3.0|This book is EXACTLY the type of book, that when I was in junior and high school, that I would sneak out from under my older teenage sister's bed and read in my room fantasizing about being Mrs. Ricky Schroder, while looking at my posters of him!!!, except triple x rated!!!. I have the sneaking suspicion that MOST of the people that are reading this book are junior and high-school girls!!. That so, reading this book took me back, Are people sure some high school kid didn't write this?.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a cool time killer...I like it. very simple old style nintendo/arcade games. don't like that u have to earn coins or purchase them.
B005LAIGPU|5.0|Great film, I felt like this film is one of those better hand held type of films, it comes with Blu Ray, Digital Copy, and regular DvD, a few things you missed in the theater version which only add on to the films greatness.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|Any resemblance between the brilliant Broadway original and this abbreviated piece of pop culture tripe... well, just doesn't exist.  Even if you've already seen this version, even if you actually LIKED this film, please do yourself the service of watching one of the complete stagings with the proper casting.<br /><br />It's the emotional difference between stepping off a street curb and jumping off the Empire State Building... one gets you six inches closer to the other side of the street, and the other transports you to another world.<br /><br />Take this sad but necessary advice from a dedicated fan of Burton, Depp and company.  This time they've cheated you out of one of life's great transformational experiences, and slapped you in the face with a short skit that has all the artistic impact of a Gong Show outtake.
B004EJUMT2|1.0|Horrible vocals just make this impossible to listen to. If you want music with the satanic edge listen to Onslaught, at least they can wail. This is for young emo kids and people under 20.
B0055Q5F36|1.0|I bought a case for my phone only to find out that is was not the correct Samsung Galaxy 2 model once I received it. It took over a week to arrive and after I sent it back 3 weeks ago, I have still not been reimbursed. They told me there is a 20% stocking fee, so I knew I wouldn't get it all back, but now I wasted postage for nothing at all. I've called twice and nobody has even answered the phone.
B006HGXGWU|1.0|is how wrong (imo) so many reviews, including those of professional critics, were about this movie. Maybe my expectations were too high going in but I have not been so excruciatingly bored in years. Usually when this happens, I find at least some distraction in the scenery, cinematography or writing. Sadly, not here. The writing was flat and sketchy, the photography pedestrian.<br /><br />It seemed as this film progressed that the pace became slower...and slower...a.n.d......s.l.o.w.e.r. I was reminded of that great old Bob & Ray radio show about the slowest talker in the world.<br /><br />The whole thing was like a badly remembered episode of Twilight Zone. Maybe it would have worked as a half hour on a small screen.<br /><br />One of the few times I really wished I could get my 2 hours back. :(((
B003O86FMW|4.0|Seems like I am on the same page as other reviewers with my opinion that this second book of The Hunger Games trilogy is not as good as the first. That being said, I still enjoyed it.<br /><br />This series, with its government-conspiracy-revolutionist-stuff, sort of feels like a mixture of other literature (such as 1984 and the darker Harry Potter books). There's even a hopeless romance for good measure. I can't quite place what makes the Hunger Games different. It just... is. I guess you have to read it to feel it.<br /><br />I think Suzanne Collins writes well. I know others have complained of her \\"simple\\" writing style, but the reader must also remember that this is a young adult book. As someone who makes a living teaching young adults, I have to say she made the RIGHT choice in using common vocabulary with only a few colorful words thrown in here and there. It's difficult to keep kids' attention in the first place, and even more so if they have to stop and look up words they don't understand. I think she does well to use words to describe situations, emotions, etc.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this book is that some of it just seemed overkill (pun not intended). There was a lot of \\"shock value\\" in the first installment. Honestly, I still can't wrap my head around making kids kill other kids for entertainment. But this time around, I found myself thinking, \\"Really? Is that really necessary?\\" - and the effect was lost. I'm not entirely sure what she was trying to accomplish with some of the things that happened in this installment of the series.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|After seeing the movie advertised so much and hearing reviews about the movie I said I have to get the book and I must say I was not disappointed at all. The book starts out a bit slow in the first couple of chapters but after that it is full speed ahead. It is so gripping and compelling I did not want to put down the book. This is probably one of the first books that I went to sleep reading the night and as soon as I woke up the morning I picked it up to continue where I left off, it is that good. I wanted to finished this book so badly, that when I was at work I could not wait to get to break or lunch just to read it.
B00701QVVY|5.0|The first three tracks just wail so hard it makes ya wanna cry. See them on tour and they'll perform all three. With this album it's official...the big four have being replaced by the big one. Overkill. Seriously, Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax and Slayer? Those four combined can't compare to the consistently great material Overkill has put out over the years. Nostalgia is great and all but Overkill has never stopped rocking.  Bobby Ellsworth gets my vote for the current King of thrash vocalists.
0307387178|4.0|My opinion is similar to a previous commenter's: the kid needed serious help, and what caused this was not his fault. The kid was not the first to run away from civilization, and will not be the last. Jon is an excellent journalist, and the book will be better if he includes the opinions of social workers.
B005FMZVLQ|4.0|The entire watch is perfect. Only when you start to use the stop watch function which you can see the hand does not stop on the zero mark. :(<br />other then this the whole item is PERFECT. Soild and nice feel.
B0000YEEGM|1.0|I was terribly disappointed because I purchased the movie and it had flaws that were bad enough to interfere with the enjoyment.  Also, i asked for replacement, but i got a refund which was very disappointing since they do have the movie in stock to replace it.
B004EPYZUS|3.0|This was a good actioner - nothing too bad, great effects, decent acting but something about it just didn't click.  Not sure what exactly it is even as I write this.  I just didn't buy into the back story about Ethan's wife getting killed or the crew he was working with.  They just didn't really gel on screen or make me care one way or another.  Cruise didn't really have much going on emotionally, other than looking 20 years younger than he really is (I think I may need to check out this Scientology thing!).  Which left me watching a bunch of really big, cool set pieces, stunts and effects, but with no really emotional engagement.  When the resolution comes at the end of the story, I was just kind of ready to shut it off.  Not a bad film, but nothing too special either.  Probably better to see it in a theater with a bunch of fan boys, than at home on the couch.....
B007V2UGPE|5.0|great graphics fun game cool effects. anyone who loves hack and slash games will like this game. zombies rock dude
B004T4LUPW|4.0|This app synced up with my Google calendar immediately and updates automatically. I did have some trouble adjusting the font sizes and colors on my Kindle Fire. There are a lot of ways to customize the settings and it's a little complicated (for me anyway). Editing and deleting events can only be accessed from the Agenda view (as far as I can tell). It works great -- just have to figure it all out.
B006WR0A8W|5.0|I bought this for a lil speaker to bring by my pool. I am REALLY impressed. Small package but huge sound. I wish it was water proof. Had it on in my kitchen and we had to turn it down to talk.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Great book with a total surprise ending! I loved every minute of it and would recommend this sad, funny, and intriging book to all fans and newbies of Jodi Piccoult. This was my first JP book and I am hooked now!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Not much to say other than I was surprised across the board that this held up.  Great acting, cool visuals and a well done, well thought out, taught film.  Much better than I think the reviews even indicated.  I suspect that fans of the series will always come away underwhelmed because film just can't pull everything together like you can in 1000 pages.<br /><br />If you think you will be turned off by the grisly nature of the story, I urge you to check it out.  Some scenes can be tough but Craig and Mara have great chemistry.<br /><br />Big thumbs up!
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|I know a lot of people don't consider this film to be a worthy prequel to John Carpenter's almighty 1982 classic, The Thing, but i think it hits the mark when you want a feeling of watching the original 82 classic all over again. It's not perfect, i first thought they had too many unknown actors in the lead roles, but over time, they all grew on me. The Thing creature could of been more gory, but for the scenes it was in, it was pretty cool. The Ending in my own mind, is the most perfect ending to a prequel ever. It just flows into the 82 classic flawlessly, when you see the Norweigian Base Camp frozen at the end, and the dead scientists inside, it hit the mark right on cue. I am actually glad they made a prequel instead of a remake of the 82 classic, because they wouldn't have done it justice. 4/5 stars for me.
0143116738|2.0|Pretty much a bunch of stories of people finding their passions. But that wasn't much help--or inspiration--in helping my find mine. I ended up skimming most of the book after awhile.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game having trouble visiting other peoples rescue center but other than that I love it. also the affects are pretty cool :) I would most deff recommend this game to people who are bored and have time in their hands.
0307951529|4.0|I see two business types spotlighted in Chris Guillebeau's latest guide to seat-of-your-pants entrepreneurship. The larger type consists of businesses like the London waitress who started a one-woman PR firm, and discovered she was so good at it that it went multinational; or the arts festival organizer who proved so good at creating buzz that it became a sensation. These are truly small businesses, one or two people, who got rich by doing a good job.<br /><br />The smaller type consists of businesses like the one-man mattress emporium with which he starts the book, or the book publishers he cites occasionally. These businesses appear small, but rely on complex networks to make their business models even possible. The mattress mogul created his retail outlet from spit and staples and string, but workers on an hourly wage make his product. Publishers require contractors to print the book or, for e-publishers, server slaves to distribute the product online.<br /><br />This gulf lurks under much of Guillebeau's book. I find his larger business model admirable. Guillebeau shows how these pioneers made a marketable product out of their own knowledge, effort, and connections. My favorite is the Omaha woman who sells custom wedding dresses worldwide: I just really, really like her. But Guillebeau doesn't examine the assumptions under his other model, which turns a profit by outsourcing the more tedious operational procedures.<br /><br />Guillebeau also does a good job explaining the how-to of making a market for the product you've created. I enjoyed his chapters on leveraging early success into continued growth, and on how to take your microbusiness into the big boys' world, if that's what you want. And he does a good job of showing how to turn a business failure into a learning experience (though again, that only works when you are your own best product, instead of shucking somebody else's output).<br /><br />I just fear that, despite the good points Guillebeau makes, heoverlooks too many assumptions of what being \\"small\\" means. If it means you make something, whether a product or service, which you then sell to others who can benefit from your expertise, then I like it, and want to follow on his trail. If it means externalizing tedium, and getting rich off the more glamorous parts, that's as bad as the bosses we all want to quit, and I want no part of it.
1607050072|5.0|I really love this book.  I think that the author's designs are fresh and fun and have a real folk-art flair.  It is also fun to follow her blog.  The designs are simple but they are appealing and I also love the seasonal aspect to many of her designs.  Having lived in Europe and traveled extensively, it's fun to see the Scandinavian design point of view applied to patchwork and quilting.  A great book for quilters of all levels and experience.  I thoroughly enjoyed it, and turn to it often for fun inspiration and ideas.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|Folks, no where, o no where, does it say in the product description that an HDMI AV adapter is needed to attach the device to the XBox.  You would think, spending this much darned money that they could have included this three dollar item.  Now I need to sit and wait until the small item gets delivered.  Buyers beware - make sure you have an RCA / Toslink Audio Adapter for Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Slim in your house, or order this part at the same time.  Don't have the disappointment I just suffered.  Amazon, you should make this right!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I have been playing graphic adventure games since the nineties and this game WOWED me. The scenery is stunning. The map helps speed play by eliminating the need to either remember where you've been or make your own map. The puzzles are challenging enough that I had to get a few hints from the built in hint system. Hope that Fire Maple Games publish many more of the same quality.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Lynne Ramsay (Ratcatcher, Morvern Callar) directs We Need to Talk about Kevin, an obsessive little film that explores the darker psychological side of motherhood. Anxieties about the developing relationship between mother and child, natural love and obligation, burgeoning personhood (read here daemonhood), gender and the culture of violence are fully realized in this maternal nightmare.<br /><br />The film is fractured, image-driven, and every frame feels Composed. The color red is always prominent. Elements and concepts repeat: slivers of bitten nails, laid out on a table are, later, eggshells pulled from the mouth and placed on a bowl's edge. Visual symbolism is heavy (the aforementioned shells begin as an entire carton of maliciously crushed eggs, which are none-the-less scrambled and eaten), and it helps if you like that sort of thing. Also worth mentioning are the darkly funny moments scattered throughout Kevin, which are visual and discreet, or owing to the stellar, unexpected soundtrack.<br /><br />The performances alone are enough reason to see We Need to Talk about Kevin, especially if you are a fan of the \\"bad seed\\" genre, or thrillers in general--Tilda Swinton is at turns radiant and haggard, empathetic and pitiable; Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller are cold and gorgeous monsters; John C. Reilly is so subtle he disappears in the role--but \\"enjoying\\" it requires the viewer's surrender to the emotional landscape, which is somewhat bleak. I held my daughter close after this one; I told her she was an angel, and that she'd never done a wrong thing.
B001GSTOAM|5.0|This was a very well written book.  The principles and ideas in this book have had a very positive impact on my code and on the other guys on the team.  We all read the book.  I highly recommend this book.
0345803485|1.0|All the girls at work started talking about \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\"<br />and so I stupidly shelled out $12 at the local bookstore thinking it<br />would be a sort of guilty pleasure. Like reaching for a second piece<br />of cake, you know it's bad but it's just so good, and you deserve it, right?<br /><br />The Entertainment Weekly blurb on the cover should have warned me that<br />this was not going to be the case.<br /><br />It wasn't the one dimensional characters that ruined this book. It<br />wasn't the poor, repetitive narrative peppered with whatever big word<br />the author's finger landed on in her thesaurus. (Concupiscent,<br />really?) It wasn't the incompetent editor who, by the way, ought to<br />fired immediately. It wasn't even the absolute lack of any real plot,<br />any sense of who these people really are, or the unfortunate love-I'm<br />sorry, \\"expletive scenes\\" that fall flat in their attempt at being exciting.<br />Nor the constant references to the status of main character's inner<br />goddess every other page. Even the author's nakedly obvious<br />foreshadowing didn't destroy this story. I could even forgive her for<br />incorrectly using words like edifice or pretending to like Thomas<br />Hardy.<br /><br />Actually I'm lying, that's pretty unforgivable.<br /><br />It is the unbelievable behavior of the characters, however, that<br />completely takes this book from silly and trite to over the top bad.<br /><br />No 21 year-old virgin worth her salt is going to be deflowered in such<br />a way and then dance around to her iPod in her (brand new) boyfriend's<br />kitchen the next morning making pancakes with no sense of shame. Any<br />girl who flushes and bites her lip every ten lines would be sobbing in<br />a locked bathroom, trying not to make any noise while coming to terms<br />with what had happened. No girl who thinks of her private parts as \\"down<br />there\\" would be enjoying one climax after another or ready to make<br />herself intoa submissive a chapter later. And if your boyfriend is a<br />billionaire running some company, he's probably too busy to be with<br />you or even email you every ten minutes. We never actually find out<br />the nature of his business either. Other than aid missions to Darfur<br />which, last time I checked, are not very profitable, he reveals<br />nothing to our damsel, who in turn betrays no curiosity.<br /><br />But what bother's me most, other than the undeserved press and<br />following this book has managed to garner, is the thought that impressionable young girls are going to read this.  Not only are they going to be exposed to over the top abusive sex<br />scenes, but the wearied and tried idea that it is a woman's job<br />\\"change\\" and rescue her lover from himself.<br /><br />My recommendation? Don't buy this book. And if you already have it<br />might make nice kindling for a bonfire.<br /><br />I have read a great deal of bad literature in my life but this is,<br />without reservation, the worst.
B005F3DFXG|5.0|The product was purchased by me on april 28th and it seemed to be fine, until I put in my PS3.Honestly im a little ticked the disc was said to be an \\"ALL REGION\\" format ,but when I received the product it said it was only \\"REGIONS 2&4\\".Now being in a REGION 1 area you can see where a REGION 2 and REGION 4 blu-ray can be a problem for me.
B000001Y5J|4.0|After their debut was released in '89, they made a comeback in the early '90s. It's an EP with 6 full length tracks and 2 instrumentals. The songs are a lot better than any off Pretty Hate Machine and it's when they turn from '80s electronic/techno to industrial and hard rock. It's not real mature lyrically or musically but it's a step and it's a sign of things to come. The songs are way heavier than on their debut and Broken still is their only truly metal album to date. Wish, Physical and Gave Up are my favorites and stand out the most. Rest of the CD is also very enjoyable though. Broken is only the beginning and The Downward Spiral comes 2 years later.
B004UID2LC|4.0|for kindle. it does work well. it does unexpectedly crash and it is harder to find youtube channels. you have to know the name/keywords of the video you want. also, download it as video unless you want the visual.

0307951529|5.0|I just finished reading The $100 Startup and loved it! I've read some other books and web resources along these same lines, but what most of them fell short with was including specific examples. Guillebeau's book has tons of examples of people who did exactly what he is proposing - go out and make a living doing what you love and making your own future. It was refreshing to read about so many people who have made a go of it for themselves and not only made money, but found something in life that has real meaning for them. If I just wanted to learn how to start a business, I wouldn't be reading this book. If I just wanted to make money, this isn't the book for that, either. It's about combining what you love with a way to generate real, livable income. I have already contacted two of the people profiled in this book to ask for further advice in my own career journey, and I am getting the help I need. I also really like Chris' idea of doing something that gives back to others. That's my idea of living a full life. I think if you're looking for a book about how to make a quick buck cheaply you won't find this book appealing, but if you want to quit giving up what you feel is your true happiness in life in exchange for a paycheck, if you want to feel like you're living your life instead of just participating in it, then this book will give you a great start in figuring out how to do it.
B002KKBV92|5.0|Very nice toy. I got this for my kids when they turned 3. They played with it a lot initially. Now after 6 months they don't play everyday but they do like to play with it every now and then. They build shapes, letters, a house out of it ! Definitely recommend it.
1451673442|5.0|This truly is an amazing book. I've read both The Secret and The Power and while I thoroughly enjoyed and loved both of those books, The Magic is the missing link that binds them together. The best part is that you do not have to read the other 2 books in order to understand this book. The Magic takes you through 28 daily exercise that help you to focus on gratitude. I thought I understood what gratitude was- until I read this book! I am now thankful for things I never would have ever thought of. It's really opened my eyes and has really changed my life and my way of thinking. I am now able to incorporate the law of attraction into my life without second guessing myself. Now when doubt tries to creep in , I am fully equipped to handle the situation properly. A must read for anyone!<br /><br />Also, I think it is important to note that this is a super easy read. You really just read one exercise daily so It's easy to fit into your schedule. And SO worth it :)
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|This edition as great picture and sound, a great expireance for all the fans and for people is seen for the very first time, and is marvelous, no doubt it is listed as one the greatest movies of all time, and the itens the came along with this great movie just mada the edition simply stunning!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book was actually very well put together, it was exciting and kept me wanting more so in my opinion you should buy this book cause it is awesome! oh and the movie was also good.
B004BSFC6Y|3.0|They are a little hard to get on, I think using wrist rattles would have been more effective. The material isn't shaped like a sock and it isn't very strechy so they are hard to get on and they just come right off. My girls love the actual bug on them and the colors are good. So I am only giving 3 stars. Not great but not awful, it gets a shoulder shrug.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it really is like you are holding a calculator in your hand.  great....clean graphic....easy to use.....free is good too.  simple...don't get if you are looking for more than that. Cause then you will rate it less than 5 stars. That would not be fair.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the best game in the entire whole wide world. it is fun and inspiring and life changing it gave me a whole new outlook on life
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game. very simple. some games are difficult to beat but you can earn points to unlock different games in a lot of different ways.
0446572993|4.0|For me Baldacci has been hit and miss lately so I'm never quite sure what I'm going to get with each new novel.  Though I wouldn't put this one among his best it's still an enjoyable read with enough suspense and action to keep most readers interested.  Like many books of this genre, you have to put aside reality for a while and accept the loner, tough persona superhero who can out think, outrun and outgun the good guys and the bad guys.  We've all met Will Robey before, even in previous Baldacci books.  He just had a different name and probably a slightly altered background.  But accept the necessary trade-off of reality for entertainment and you'll find yourself enjoying the ride.  Baldacci stretches a bit when he ties all the plot elements together so cleanly at the end but he still delivers a fun, shoot-em-up thriller that's also a quick read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I don't usually like these kinds of games but this game is pretty awesome U don't need dev points or whatever sill much.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I can quickly check the days weather each morning and decide what to wear then  plan my day.  Extremly helpful and easy to use.
B000069AUI|5.0|Listening Rush Blood Head after 10 years, I am amazed that it was the 21rst of the 100 best Rolling Stone recordings for the 00´s. It could have been easily in the top 5. Amazing what time does. This has to be the best music cd of the so far 21rst century. Full of masterpieces in simple and loving form. Can´t describe the feeling of WOW.....
B004FEFS5E|5.0|So, I have been seriously shooting for about a year, or I should say I got my first DSLR a year ago after using a \\"Bridge\\" camera for the last decade.  My DSLR, a Sony A700, is a fine camera, it is also a \\"Pro-sumer\\" level camera in that along with the standard PASM (Program, Aperture Priority, Shutter Priority, and Manual) exposure capabilities the camera has many fine manufacture designed creative options built into the camera. And with so many options and so much to learn in handling the camera I chose to concentrate on framing and general composition to start with- sticking with \\"Auto\\" and the six fundamental \\"Scene\\" options easily set with the camera's top dial.  Choosing this path I did get some nice images right off the bat!  After about six months I decided to commit to setting manual exposures- mostly aiming to keep images sharp and in decent dynamic range contrast wise- I'm a landscape shooter. About three months into this I picked up a copy (downloaded a Kindle version on to my pc) of the 'Understanding Exposure' after reading of others suggesting it at the Ugly Hedgehog photography site. What a revelation!  For getting great images right out of the camera this book pulled everything together for me.  I now deliberately process my setups in terms of what I want the camera to do in regard to the image it will make.  A very well thought out, and easily understood book- in my case it seamlessly translated to improved photography practiced in the field.  I highly recommend it.  A must read for photographers wanting to improve their skills.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|This could have easily been a 5 star movie with just a few minor changes.  First drop the \\"Disney\\" label; this is not your typical Disney movie, at least not compared to anything released recently. Keep in mind when you watch the movie that it is based on material that was written 100 years ago, so the \\"science\\" is dated and seems silly at times.  The plot could have been modified to make Barsoom a planet in another solar system, instead of Mars.  Changing the location to somewhere other than Mars would have vastly increased the believability of the entire plot.  Don't listen to the paid critics, when viewed in the correct context this is a very good movie.
1451627289|5.0|After the first few pages I couldn't stop reading this novel.  It's my first Stephen King book and I hope others will have the same effect.  Great story/concept but I especially liked the character development.  Enjoy!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|glad I waited till I could read all 3 at once.  did not think I would like them, but was urged to read them by a family member.  I loved them. great reading and I think relates to our world today and what we could become as we let government take control of our lives.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice age takes you to Skrats world and is so easy for my 7 year old to enjoy. I have my own world too. its very addicting!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Was so excited about the third book that I purchased it while I was reading the first book. Little did I know that I would feel more than irritated at the &#34;heroine&#34; as she refused food, bit her lip, blushed and holy~cowed her way through this novel. It was good while it lasted~ in book 1 and 2.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fun time killers. the controls for some of the games aren't very good. its free.  you get what u get
B0063IH60K|3.0|Too easy; I win all the time.  Needs to be more challenging. It is OK for some zombie-like amusement but it isn't an attention getter.
0439023521|5.0|I saw the movie first, but I ended up liking the book better. the ending is different than the movie, which is also better.  I love the plot the most because it's unique and engaging.  I also love the love triangle part :)  Also, I never ever read books. And I loved this. It has made me want to read more books now
B007J4T2G8|5.0|You will fall in love with all the characters in this book.  Christen Grey is my fantasy now! You will not regret this purchase...all 3 books are worth every penny. Oh and a side note, your spouse will benefit from this book as well. I won't tell you how but they will....just read it now!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|You can already tell by all but 1 person (as of writing this) that this is an amazing flashlight...so why do I really need to say what has already been mentioned? Next I will get the TK70.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|I saw the DVD over the weekend and it was just awful. The thoughts corny and embarrassing quickly came to mind while I was watching it and it pretty much describes the entire movie when finished. I think if the horrendous dancing and singing snippets were taken out entirely it would be a much more enjoyable movie. I mean come on we have to listen to \\"walk it out\\" and \\"under pressure\\" being sang by penguins? Horrible.
0439023513|4.0|Spoiler Alert!<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />Okay well I loved this book during the first half. It had suspense, but then right around the middle things started moving really fast.  People started dying left and right and there wasn't much mention of them afterwards.  That made me kind of disappointed.  Also, it made me kinda sad how Peeta was never the same again.  He was my second favorite character and he totally lost his personality.  I thought they would find a way to fix him or something.  Then at the end things really started rushing and she didn't really mention why she killed coin.  I mean I can figure out why, but she didn't really give any explanation afterwards and she never mentioned if they actually did have another HUnger Games because I thought katniss only agreed to another hunger games to gain trust from coin. I also wish she would have given an explanation for that decision too.  Then, at the end when katniss was arrested and had to stay in her old room in the tower , I felt like she changed too much.  LIke she wanted to commit suicide, but I thought her character was a lot stronger than that. And she didn't seem worried about what happened to peeta or gale.  then when she was released she never really menitoned them still.  And it make me kind of upset at the very end when she talks about how gale ended up working in another district.  It's like she just completely stopped caring about him or something even after all they have been through :/ And then it's like she never sees her mother again too. And the epilogue was kind of depressing.  It's like katniss just wasn't the same anymore.  She just sounds like some depressed person, which I get I mean I know a lot of people died , but she just lost her personality to me.  Overall, the ending was disappointing, but most of the book was really good and it had plenty of suspense and action.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Although the first book in this series was great, this one almost lives up to it.  I'd love for there to be more books in this series.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love it!  Great for taking short notes.  Never watch t.v. without it!  Love the fact that I can type a note on my phone and have access to it on my kindle and home and work computers.
B005XT10YS|5.0|Years ago, I saw a television play on the trial of Mary Surratt. It spurred an interest in history which has stayed with me to this day. Her's is an interesting story and the debate on her guilt or innocence in the Lincoln Conspiracy will rage on. Certainly her trial was not a high point of American judiciary proceedings. The film is well done and well acted. My only objection is that it borders on the propagandistic in several places, but it stayed close to historical events by and large. Viewers who are just seeking entertainment will be disappointed by \\"The Conspirator.\\" Those who have an interest in history should find it very revealing. This is one of the better films from last year. Highly recommended.
0439023491|5.0|This was my favorite book out of the trilogy.  It had a lot of suspense and action.  Also I loved that there's a huge twist in it that I wasn't expecting.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game is pretty cool. The graphics are nice and vibrant, if a bit cartooney. If I have a complaint, it is the lack of being able to earn premium coins.
B000WAGVHE|2.0|i cant put the disc on the package because is broken and if i leave it in the disc will be loose and might get damage. i have a picture of the product
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I feel its a bit of a childish game but when you want to do something brainless and relatively easy and fun this app will definetley help kill time.
0345803485|5.0|Not only does e l James provide details that make you clench your teeth there's also a romance that leaves you longing for more. The romance is these 3 books is one I wish I can find one day and I will re read these books over and over again.<br /><br />I can only hope ahe comes out with a fourth ! It's. Must read !!
B004UID2LC|5.0|It works very very well. The only problem is that the first thing you download becomes the cover for any other song you download.

B00008BXJJ|5.0|I Love AC/DC! They are totally awesome. I used to have 13 of their L.P.s, but I do not seem to have many CDs. This collection has an awseome version of \\"Thunderstruck\\". The rest is great, too.<br /><br />AC/DC Rocks! but only if you wanta rock-n-roll!

B0010SEMP0|5.0|This book is a perfect compliment to the way the first book ended. Excellent character development and storyline. I enjoy reading the banter and slang tossed around between characters, and the story is fun and pulls the reader in for the ride. Enjoy! This is a great book in a great series.
B000G6O2TS|5.0|I got this for my 3 year old son, who likes horses and knights.  He loves it - even takes it to be with him.  It's very durable and detailed.  The lance is removable (he doesn't like fighting, so he took it off), and the knight comes off the horse, too.  We have other models by this manufacturer, and they are all favorites.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|Loved this book, the only thing I had a hard time getting beyond is the college kid atmosphere, and the fact Abby is so young, it almost felt wrong to share some of the feelings she had. I laughed and cried and wished there was more when it came to an end!  Would recommend to young adult.
B004K4AVAG|4.0|Just great beats!  People will see a 62 year old white male head banging in the car to the great beats.
0345803485|3.0|Make no mistake - this book is badly written and so poorly edited that I am forced to question whether the author self-published. James' writing style doesn't flow easily, and as a reader, I found myself getting tired of reading Anastasia's perspective as the story is written in the first person. For a heroine that is supposed to be an English Literature student (one with a 4.0 GPA no less), Anastasia's vocabulary is extremely limited to about five adjectives that she repeats to the point of redundancy and three expletives preceded by the word &#34;Holy&#34;. Her thoughts, frequently represented in italics throughout the book, are completely unnecessary and superfluous. In fact, the book would benefit from completely deleting those out.  However, those cons aside, I must give James credit for an interesting story. Although Anastasia is somewhat annoying (I blame poor editing and the fact that the book is written in the first person), Christian Grey's character is fascinating to start (despite being ridiculously unrealistic), and I found I could not put the book down because I wanted to discover what happens between the two.   Had I not been interested to know more about Christian Grey, I would probably have given this book one star purely for poor editing. But as much as I hated James' writing, it was a page-turner and as such, I rated it better.
B007ZCQJOM|4.0|Very Good follow up to the BEAUTIFUL Teen Dream LP. This sounds like it could be the second disc to teen dream, very similar in sound, but not as great. A definite must buy if you liked their previous album. Both go great hand in hand.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|The Grey is a very depressing and factually incorrect movie. Why didn't you stay with the plane people? The black box emits a location radio signal beacon. Rescuers would have come for you. Gave it one star for the scenery. I wasted $3.99.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had not heard much about this book until one of the librarians at our library happened to mention how much she enjoyed it. I decided to check it out and was honestly captivated from the beginning. I had a very hard time putting it down and will definitely read the other two books, as well. Excellent book, i highly recommend it!
B004J88SGC|4.0|Enjoyed the concert Dvd.  i was not familiar with some of the songs, but  I believe a mored dedicated Billy fan would be.  Enjoyed the songs, acommpanying musicians, guest performers, and a historic night closing down Shea Stadium.  Glad I bought it.
B007C9N4H8|5.0|High quality video, no problems loading, user friendly interface.  Movie was very enjoyable tribute to the classic Muppet films, any fan of the Muppets will enjoy this movie.
0553385461|5.0|Excellent book, by one of the greatest minds of our time, with crisp langage and good detailed information. Felt like revisiting my history+physics classes all over again.
B0082K1LJY|5.0|This is about two brothers who fight supernatural monsters. The acting is great. The story line is interesting. I strongly suggest starting with the first season and watching all the way through. I would not start watching with this season. It would be too confusing to get the story line.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent trilogy.  A \\"difficult to put down\\" read.  The Hunger Games reaches a wide range of readers.  Saw the movie and it followed the first book very well.  Really would like to see more books on it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Well done. Fun and interesting. Shooting is still as hard as grade school version lol. Nice to go back and still be able to enjoy it.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|David Baldacci didn't disappoint he creates a novel that keeps you turning the page.  I am an avid follower of Baladacci he keeps on going strong.  I recommend his books.
0811879542|5.0|I received this book yesterday. It looked interesting and had great reviews so I ordered it. I was little skeptical of how interactive it could be, but was quite surprised and impressed with the book. Both my 3 year old (for whom I bought the book) and my 8 year old LOVEDit. We read it four times in a row last night.<br /><br />I can't believe I haven't heard of Herve Tullet before. I guess that's what happens when you only look at the Scholastic order forms for your kids. I hunt Amazon for my own books, why havemti done this for my children before? I know. Whata \\"duh\\" moment.<br /><br />I am purchasing this book for my preschooler's classroom. It is THAT good. I also very rarely take the time to writes review - it is THAT good, too! Looking forward to collecting his other books - I really think they will be keepers.<br /><br />PS/ when I went to the publisher'swebsite, I discovered there is an app for the book. I was about to purchase it, but then stopped myself. It's son nice just as a book, and we have so much distraction with the iPads and iPods that just having it as a book is great enough.
0345803485|3.0|I've read the good and bad reviews here. As far as the good reviews, I thought the book was an interesting, easy beach read...although I have to admit that I hid it when children walked by my beach chair. There were some hot scenes and then some really messed up stuff...but then again, I'm pretty \\"vanilla\\" and more into love stories than this whole BDSM stuff. To me, some of it was very disturbing because it was like reading abuse scenes...but I guess if you're into that, who am I to judge? I did skip through the spanking scenes and the \\"flogging.\\" Ha! My husband better not get any ideas...<br /><br />As for the bad reviews, c'mon, did you really think this was going to be a great piece of literature? So many are complaining that it is poorly written. Sure, it's no literary classic, but take it for what it is...a good easy beach read. I am not a \\"bored housewife\\" but did enjoy reading a book that took me out of my normal day to day for a moment. Believe me, I work 40 hours a week, have a 2-year-old, a husband, a needy dog and am pregnant with #2...I'm not bored. If anything, this book has made me appreciate my husband a little more. He's no Christian Grey, but at least he doesn't beat the crap out of me when I speak out of line. Sheesh, I'd be black in blue if that were the case.<br /><br />Overall, I give this book 3 stars as it is no literary piece of art, but it was interesting enough to keep me reading...and I was able to finish in about a week. I went ahead and purchased 2 and 3...not because I think it's a great book, but because it's like watching a really bad reality tv show that you won't admit to watching but can't seem to turn off.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 games is awesome! It has the best variaty of games to chose from and you get them with points stored up from winning previous games that you have then passed!
B0076NAWWA|5.0|I didnt know what to expect - an assortment of amazing musicians noted for their progressive rock efforts doing (as rumor had been saying) pop music?!? But knowing Neal Morse & Steve Morse, with the quality of their output being consistently high throughout their careers, I had nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Sure enough, even with the shock of it being very pop song structured material, this CD in one word ROCKS. There's two or three tracks which get a bit heavier (hard not to do with Portnoy drumming) but overall its a true mix of all their influences in a cumulative amazing stew of wonderful songs. I put it into my CD player in my car and have not taken it out yet after more than four weeks since receiving the package. Highly recommended CD!!
B0053TMP24|5.0|this is an awesome book but please make the release date (for mark of athena) earlier than OCTOBER!!!!!!!!THATS SIX MONTHS(or something like that)!!!!!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After reading all the negative reviews, I guess you can put me in the \\"moron\\" category.  I have never before read a book of this type, \\"erotica\\", so to speak, so who am I to say if it was good or not?  All I know is I enjoyed it, took it for what it was (a story) about two people of differing backgrounds and experiences, having an affair, and, eventually, a relationship.  What's all the fuss?  I'm sure the writer didn't expect he/she was writing the next great classic novel.  Just take it for what it is..entertaining.  If you don't like, fine.  But apparently, plenty of others did.  I enjoyed the first book, the next and the next.  That's just how I roll..

B00030DEQE|4.0|I purchased this card to use in a test VMware ESXi system. Since it had great reviews and others stated that it worked with ESXi, I decided to buy it.<br /><br />During the install of ESXi, everything went smoothly. However, when I booted the server for the first time, the card was not visible is ESXi (i.e. 'esxcfg-nics -l' only showed the on-board NIC). Reviewing the output of 'dmesg' showed this error for the new card: 'e1000: 0000:01:06.0: e1000_probe: Invalid MAC Address'<br /><br />I then used a bootable Ubuntu USB drive to start the server so that I could further diagnose the issue. Running 'ifconfig -a' showed the card to have the following MAC: 01:01:00:00:06:a2. This is an invalid MAC address according to ESXi, I believe because of the first octet, and it does not match the MAC address printed on the card. Fortunately, this was a simple fix using a package called 'ethtool.'<br /><br />This will not be extremely detailed and is probably not for beginners, but you can do the following to fix the issue:<br /><br />1) Run 'ethtool -e eth0   head -n 3', which will dump out a couple of header rows and then a line of hex. The first six bytes of the hex output should show the currently configured MAC address.<br /><br />2) Run the following to replace the invalid MAC address with the MAC address printed on the card (e.g. 00:07:e9:01:02:03).<br /># ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x017c8086 offset 0x0 value 0x00<br /># ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x017c8086 offset 0x1 value 0x07<br /># ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x017c8086 offset 0x2 value 0xe9<br /># ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x017c8086 offset 0x3 value 0x01<br /># ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x017c8086 offset 0x4 value 0x02<br /># ethtool -E eth0 magic 0x017c8086 offset 0x5 value 0x03<br /><br />3) If you run 'ethtool -e eth0   head -n 3' again, the first six bytes should show the new MAC address.<br /><br />4) Reboot the server and ESXi and the new card should be able to get an IP address now.<br /><br />In short, I am guessing that this cardis a refurbished item and that the refurbish process did not include resetting the EEPROM. At least it was a simple fix, but I still only gave the product 4-stars because of this issue.
B004ZY0VHY|1.0|I sincerely do not understand what makes this an acclaimed novel. Perhaps it is the psychological case study of Eva (psycho boy's mom). To the point, why do we need a fictionalized account of a school shooting when the thing itself stares us in the eye? I suppose other women may find this offensive. Perhaps I am dismissing Eva's struggle to find out what it means to be a mother. Perhaps not. If you want a real grasp on the reality of lives lost, a community fractured, and the young people behind it all, read Columbine. It is not painful to read and it will not bring you joy, but it does attempt to bring understanding to the school shootings that have rocked America. Dave Cullen painstakingly researched the matter over the span of 10 years. It is a must read. I felt morbid when I bought it, but quickly came to understand how purposeful it is. Give it a try if you are sincerely interested in the matter.
0345803485|5.0|When I first heard about this book I didn't think it was something I would be intrested in reading.... then I saw it on the Dr. Oz show and decided to give it another look. I am so glad I did. When I first began reading it I couldn't see how it could help strengthen my marriage. I was as shocked as Ana as I learned, with her, things that I didn't know existed. I couldn't put the book down and ended up reading all three in four days. Not only are the books well written but they are complete. I love the ending, it was perfect, perfect, perfect! Nothing was left unanswered. I learned alot from these books, not just about sex and relationships, but why people do what the do, why they feel the need for such control. Amazingly it opened up conversations with friends that I had never had before, learning that we as humans live with and are affected by our past's every day. I have had in depth conversations with my husband about my wants and needs, simple things like holding hands more often, as well as discussing his. If you give this book a chance, and keep reading when you are blown away by another lifestyle so different from your own, you learn that in the end love changes a person for the better, you learn that a relationship is a complex combination of the past, present, and future that defines who we are as individuals and as a couple. I can't say enough good things about this book and how it has opened my eyes to things I had not seen before.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|I can't recommend this series enough to people! Everyone who asks me I tell them the same thing \\"YOU MUST READ IT!\\" Fascinating story, love the characters.

B006FE83UE|5.0|Released in 1962, To Kill a Mockingbird ranks #34 on the AFI top 100 movie list and shows clearly just how powerful a classic movie can be. Where many movies fade and wither in time, To Kill a Mockingbird remains just as powerful, just as memorable as when it was first filmed. In other movies the characters can feel dated. The acting can seem shoddy. People make excuses about \\"well, it was only the 1960s. What can you expect.\\" THIS is what you can expect. The dialogue is stellar. The acting is superb. Even in black and white, even with the limited technology available, you get sucked in, immersed, and feel the full reality of what is going on. This is what high quality movie making is all about.<br /><br />The movie is a perfect window into events which were all too familiar during the Great Depression. People struggled to get by. They had to try to pay their bills with crops grown in their back yard. People with mental illness were treated little better than dogs. Women were beaten. Into all of this comes young Scout, a girl growing up with her older brother and widowed father. She is a tomboy, eager to speak out and fight for her cause. The worst thing her brother can accuse her of is acting like a \\"girl\\". She has strong ideals and is not afraid to voice them.<br /><br />Her father, a lawyer, is tapped to represent a local black man who has been accused of raping a white woman. Most of the town wants to lynch the poor accused man, although some townsfolk see the injustice of it. Scout leaps into fights with her schoolmates to defend the honor of her father. And ironically, when her father is threatened, it is her willingness to speak up and say what she feels that helps to soothe the situation.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this film. Gregory Peck is incredible. He gives just the right touch to so many scenes. You can see in his eyes the mix of emotions as he stands strong on the steps before the mob. When his son is hurt, and he's standing outside the window trying desperately to figure out what to do, my heart ached for him. His strength in the courtroom, and his tenderness with his kids is just stunning.<br /><br />I have seen this movie many times, and I look forward to seeing it many more. Every time someone tries to make a case for a shoddy movie from the 60s or 50s, claiming \\"well it's just how movies were made back then\\", I point to this one. THIS is how fine movies were made in this time period. This shows great acting, great dialogue, and a mix of characters who are authentic and interesting and respectful of their origins. The mentally ill man is not treated as a joke. He is a real human being. The drunkard father, the lying daughter, and the plight of the black members of the community are all shown with clarity and realism.<br /><br />It is a minor, interesting note, that despite the movie seeming to revolve around women, they never talk with each other! It's all about how men impact their lives. Scout is central but she is primarily talked to by her father and brother. Those are the influences she cares about. Only briefly does the nanny character talk with her. Similarly, the lying daughter is another key character but she is only ever talked to / at by the lawyer and her father. The movie is about how the women are handled / guided by men. I think the only time a female really talks to any of these women is when the nanny scolds Scout for how she behaves to a guest. That's the one instance in the entire film.<br /><br />Highly recommended in the strongest possible words. Everyone should see this film.de the window trying desperately to figure out what to do, my heart ached for him.

B003X5UFWW|5.0|One of the best martial arts movie I have ever seen.  The martial arts is very well choreographed and executed. The story line was excellent and well written plus this is a true story, unbelievable.  You just have to see it for yourself.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|first this was my favorite game then I was in school and tried to open this it didn't work blackout and then closes. it says that I have too much on my kindle fire I deleted a bunch but still same reaction. I will b so sad id this continues!! :(
031250926X|5.0|i loved this book growing up and i am very happy that i now have a copy for my son.  the price was great and i received it fairly quickly after ordering.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|This author is very good at creating his world with words. The detail is astonishing and it makes you feel like you're really there, from the warm, rich climate of Kings Landing to the cold and desolate one north of the Wall. It does get very depressing but only because you create a kinship with the characters and anything that hurts them hurts you as you're reading. I'm not use to a book taking me so long to read but only because its so full of detail and this book is well over 1,000 pages you have to read carefully because if you skim even one paragraph, you'll be missing something important. This is entire series is amazing and if you have HBO tune in to the show.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Place a science fiction show in a small town in Maine, and the product is Haven. The characters are more complex than they first let on. However, it is the chemistry between the partners that carries the show.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love the Adobe Reader it's AMAZING for my kindle. There were alittle technical difficulties but then I figured it out. This review was mostly just saying that you could have some problems with it but it's easy to figure out.<br /><br />By:Awesomer101. &lt;3
006197806X|5.0|I'm always looking for books that are age appropriate for my child.  This book is fine for my 14 yo who is currently reading the first book of this trilogy, \\"Delirium\\".
B004132HZS|5.0|Sherlock is hysterical. I go to Caltech, and I've met some genius just as smart and self-absorbed, but never any as funny. Watson isn't a bumbling idiot, and his background as a war doctor is interesting.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|We truly enjoyed Walking Dead I and II. So much so that we ended up staying up way into the morning hours with the anticipation of *One more show* until there was One more left and we called it a night *er or early morning?* lol<br />Can not wait for Season III
0061726834|5.0|I'm always looking for books that are age appropriate for my child.  This book is fine for my 14 yo, she is actually reading it now and having a hard time putting it down.
B001LF347E|5.0|I think this show is hysterical. The interaction between Arthur and Merlin always makes me laugh. This has easily become one of my favorite shows.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book delivered!  Couldn't put it down!  You might as well buy the whole trilogy!  You cant stop at the first one, you'll just want MORE!
B006MVJ2L4|2.0|Could not wait to get my hands on 'Tresspassing' after repeatedly playing his previous album \\"For your Entertainment.\\" But unfortuently Tresspassing fell short. Though the songs were incredibly strong and heartfelt, I miss the old Adam and his retro 80s sound. Sorry this album was not for me.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This show is awesome! I watched the entire first season in only a few days. The characters are amazing, and the special effects are quite good for a TV show. I'm scared to watch the second season because the first was so good.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I liked the Mystery of Crimson Manor better....this one was REALLY short....I love these types of games, though....was still enjoyable....wouldn't say it was worth a dollar....watch for lowered price before you buy....
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun to play when you have no life haha. fun to play when board out of your mind. you should get this app
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Awesome read!!! I read the whole book in a day! I would absolutely read it again and recommend it to anyone that love a good love story. The characters were well developed the storyline... Although similar to a lot of the romance love novels out... Ie twilight, fiftty shades etc... Had a very different story line that I thoroughly enjoyed. Right when you thought the book was going to be like all the others it took a turn and really kept you interested. If you were a twilight/fifty shades fan, I think this is an awesome follow up!
0345803485|2.0|I'm not a prude but this is over the top!  how many men will now believe women ENJOY being dominated and hit???  None of it is believable and I won't be purchasing #2 and #3.  Sorry I wasted my precious reading time and money on this one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|diz game is actually gd............loooovvvveeee it but nor as much as Sims but still gd...<br />creating our own village dats just creativity rite there my friends.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Same powerful attitude and riffs that i expected after their debut album.  This has a better variety of songs.  Some nice slower tracks to go with the great hard rocking ones.  The explicit version is not something you want to play at your grandmother's party but is still pretty tame. If you liked the first album or other female fronted hard rock, this is a must buy.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game. It's alot like Mario, but it's still fun! Plus it's FREE! And unlike most apps it works on the kindle fire. It's a must have.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I love this cd and the title song is amazing! I wish he did Trespassing on American Idol but maybe it was a bit too wild for the show. I hope he does it on another show sometime soon because it is amazing!! Love Him- Love the CD!
B005ZUR724|4.0|This game is great and would have given five stars if gameloft would do quest bug fixes and do new content/ dungeons.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|His is the best app if you want to get your daily dose of God! It has everything from reading plans to Bible audio. I highly reccomend for ANYBODY!
B007DIQC90|3.0|I stumbled upon Of Monsters when I was doing some research about one of my favorite bands, Sigur Ros. I quickly bought `My Head is an Animal' and instantly liked it. The songs on this album are borderline pop- with a great mix of the folksiness of bands such as Edward Sharpe and the Magnificent Zeros, the Arcade Fire and even a slice of Fleet Foxes, yet there is sweetness to their music that reminds me of a spring day, windows down, sun shining, music loud.<br /><br />The biggest complaint that I have is that the album seems too repetitive. That folk sound, the `Heys!' the strumming of the chords is similar in every single song, there is little growth or distinction from track to track. The problem is that finding the sound of the band is a sure way to provide the fans with great music, but to me it signals a huge problem for future endeavors. There are no single songs that come across as the best or the worst, they are all the same. With `My Head is an Animal' the formula works well, but tracks on an album are meant to evolve, to grow, to give the listener a music experience- a revelation and it is not here.<br /><br />Of Monsters and Men are definitely a band that I will watch and hope that they can grow in their craft. I think that the talent is there, from the song writing to the melodies.<br /><br />To be clear, I do not think that these musicians are a lost cause, there is clear talent here, but I think they do not have voice of their own. It is almost like 'folk-pop' or what have you. You have the folk musicians, such as Avett Brothers, My Morning Jacket and even Iron & Wine and then you have those bands that are more commericially exceptable, such Mumford and Sons- each different type of folk artist I welcome with open arms, but there is a distinction between these musicans. What I find with Monsters is that they are trying to find what direction that they want to go- and that is NOT to say that they cannot be genre-less, the album is just a mixture.<br /><br />I like their sound- they are a welcomed new breeze in a land of boring, I just expect more I guess. But, by all means given them a try if you like Mumford & Sons, the National and even Bon Iver. You will not feel as though you have wasted time getting lost in the head of the animal- you just may have a hard time (like myself) waiting for the next step in the evolution of Monsters and Men.<br /><br />Favorite Track: Little Paws.r />I like their sound- they are a welcomed new breeze in a land of boring, I just expect more I guess.

0345803485|5.0|Such a good series! Totally enthralled and can't get enough! If Tou haven't read it yet what are you waiting for?! Your significant other will thank you ;)!
B004WR125O|1.0|- The adapter was easy to configure, I had zero issues connecting it to my network. I did find that when streaming it would constantly drop the connection and buffer. The signal was no better than 20% at any given moment. I am only 20 feet from the wireless access point. I plugged in a netgear wireless USB adapter and to my surprise the onkyo receiver picked it up and began to use it. I get 90% strength with the receiver in the same location. I am sending this back for a refund.
B0061S0A64|4.0|Simple in theory but if you are a music leaning person it will entertain you for hours. Does exactly what it says. I'd love to see how they expand on the idea in future updates.<br /><br />The sleep timer is very cool, that is, if you set up some music which you find relaxing.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love this game! Very easy to earn coins and acorns. I play this game every day as it is very addictive!
1451673442|5.0|I have read \\"The Secret\\", \\"The Power\\" and \\"The Magic\\" from Ms Rhonda Byrne. I think \\"The Magic\\" is the most \\"practical\\" than other two. According to the \\"practices\\" recommended from Rhonda to be done in 28 days, as I am so eager to try them in my daily life, I did all the practices in three days. So, the magic begins! The gratitiude becomes the source of my energy and it totally changes everything around me. People who didn't talk to me much, start to talk to me more and very nicely. My work is going smoother than before. My daily life is full of happiness and surprises. Every morning, I am just looking foward to what amazing things will happen that day. All the negatives become the \\"positives\\", at least I change my mind on this \\"negativities\\" into \\"positivities\\" and gratitude.<br /><br />So, Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br /><br />P.S. For the Magic Rock, I pick a jade, which was from my mother and she passed away 4 years ago, and hang it on my neck as necklace. Whenever I touch it, apart from the gratitude I have, I also feel LOVE.
0307951529|5.0|I have gotten through this book twice so far and I plan to read it three more time.  It is packed with so much useful information that I have to take it in layers or I fear I might miss something.  Really great job Chris!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is so much fun I think you should make another app like this one it is really cool!!!!!!
B007C4ZJ3K|1.0|We watched scene after scene that had little or no dialog.  There was no plot and little rhyme or reason for the next action sequence.  It was a shock that Michael Douglas made a cameo in this film.  He must be hard up for cash.  This was a waste of time making it and viewing it.  Don't waste your money or time.  This film is very poor.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This movie was AWSOME...full-tilt-boggie from start to finish. Dont listen to negitive reviews of this film, cant wait for the next one.
B00000HYXB|5.0|As a Tolkien fan and a lover of The Silmarillion, I found this rock opera amazing. It offers a new look (or sound) to an amazing history while really capturing the emotion of the events!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This game is really fun but a little hard. The bird's powers are cooler than they are in the regular angry birds
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Really well constructed. Plays great on Kindle Fire. Very similar to Mario games but probably a little easier. Would recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is a real pleasure to use. It has so many different versions. I have my favorite version on my kindle fire so I can use it anywhere. There are many great devotionals as well. It's so easy to use. I love it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a genius app and I would recommend it to everyone. As an artist, a writer and the person who oversees nearly evey activity going on at my household the ability to sync my tablet, phone and computer all together with a simple notetaking interface is a godsend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|A few spots in the series were a little redundant...but overall a good story with some writing that made me seriously wonder if the author had written from experience (lucky girl!) Or was just incredibly creative!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Like so many of the curious, I found myself a copy of 50 Shades of Grey so I could read what all the \\"hype\\" was about. I read some reviews, watched Ellen's little skit on Youtube and decided I would take a look for myself before passing judgement. I'll admit I was looking for the \\"wow\\" factor that transitioned E. L. James from a Twilight Fan Fiction writer to a traditionally published author.<br /><br />Fan fiction aside (both the author and publisher insist it is an original work of art, despite evidence to the contrary), the writing is redundant and lacks polish. The editor should be mortified over the miss use of words such as \\"subconscious\\", not to mention the repetition, the word is found on nearly every page. Aside from its blatant miss use, it quickly loses effect and becomes boring because there is very little variation in Ana's internal dialogue.<br /><br />Still, pressing forward, what is it about this book that so many women are gushing over? It can't be the sex. Either I'm too jaded, have read too much or \\"just don't get it\\". There is much better erotica easily available to women everywhere: erotica that isn't degrading, but still involves rough play, bondage and other fetishes. A trip to a sex show will easily illustrate these are very common activities and not really so taboo as they once were. After a while, even the shock value of the sex wears off and loses its appeal - perhaps the author is simply giving away too much.<br /><br />I must be losing my marbles - I can't find any redeeming features in this book. At this point, I have read about one half of it, have skimmed over other parts and am struggling with finishing it to the end. Looking at character development - there simply isn't any. Ana is whiney, annoying and nearly spineless, despite her last name of \\"Steele\\". Christian is an ass - overbearing, selfish and quite frankly, rather bland. Perhaps I need to force myself to read a bit further, but my time is valuable, and I think, for my purposes, I've done enough research to answer my own question.<br /><br />Vintage Press, an imprint of Random House, should be embarrassed by this publication. Not because of its contents, and not because of its origins, but because of its poor presentation. For all intents, they seem to have been in such a hurry to deliver it to the public that they couldn't be bothered to give it the attention and invest the resources any published book deserves. Sure, it's selling millions of copies, and making them millions of dollars - but what it's done to their reputation is irreparable. In fact, the entire situation makes me glad I'm an Indie writer. If this is what one of the \\"big six\\" puts out, I'd rather be dependent only on myself. I'll be spending my pennies on Indie Books in the future. Many of them are better written, with more engaging characters, and interesting plots. There's no point in supporting major publishing houses when they can't be bothered to spend the money necessary to make an author's work the best it can be.es, I've done enough research to answer my own question.<br /><br />Vintage Press, an imprint of Random House, should be embarrassed by this publication.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have this on my ipod touch and now on my kindle fire! everyone in the world should get this game! 100 stars from me!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Saw this movie 3 times and never got bored it was absolutely fantastic, thrilling, and great acting. One of the best I have seen for quite sometime.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I am really glad that I downloaded this app. I like the fact that all my PDF files are located in one general area for easy access.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|I went through several bottles without any luck. I ended up using the device to score an even line and then clamped my dremel tool to my work bench, set up the wet/dry vac behind the dremel diamond rotary blade and slowly cut around the bottle of Stone Brewery Ale. Use 120 grit and then 220 grit sand paper to smooth the edges.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This young adult trilogy has elements for everyone.  I am in my early 30's and throughly enjoyed these books.  Each book leads to the next and they are very difficult to put down!  The character development and different plot set these books apart from other young adult fiction.  Also to consider the world that Collins has portrayed is both surreal and yet believable.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Easy to read and overall a great book! This one is just as good as the first two of the series. It has a great ending to the trilogy. Highly recommend you read all three and then watch the movie. =)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|my sons just love it and so does mom. they just love playing with my tablet at least this way I can choose what they're playing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy to read and overall a great book! I read the first one (The Hunger Games) while on vacation and finished that one in three days. When I came home from vacation, I had no choice but to buy this one, and this one was just as good! I love the whole \\"love story\\" and metaphor of war detailed in the book.<br />Once you read this one, you have no choice but to read Mockingjay!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is fun and entertaining!  Keeps your interest even after a few days unlike most games! very impressed.  the animation are cute and funny
B000002OZY|1.0|My player says I am listening to the WHO's Greatest Hits, but it is in fact TOMMY. This CD is worth ( because of defect)  $1.00  ----  rip off
B005DOL0R0|5.0|It's a good product, seems well made, and is holding up well after a month or so of use.  The padding seems sufficient enough to protect my Kindle Fire from getting banged around, and the material is durable and lightweight.  A decent value as well...
B0066W1AZK|3.0|this app is very good but seriously needs to be updated!!!! I would reccomend getting a different chess app.not this one. quality is poor and it really needs to be updated.Its ok.
B005NKGEP2|4.0|At times it was a bit lame but other wise ok.  The characters were believable and the locations were nicely described.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|This was a beautifully constructed deeply moving novel about a very contemporary topic. The characters are very believable, the situation in which they find themselves heartbreaking. Nonetheless, the author avoids descending into bathos. There is also humour in the tale, life does go on, and the tale is wrapped up with a hopeful ending. Gripping, it held me spellbound from beginning to end.
0060926317|1.0|This book was selected by my book group years ago when it first came out. I have not been to Australia but my husband lived there for several years and has talked to me about it. Even with my very tangential knowledge of Australia, I could tell this book was fake. The writing was amateurish and pretentious. I hope I had just borrowed this book because I would hate to think I might have supported this hoax. Ugh!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was an excellent conclusion to the Millennium Trilogy, and in parts it is a spy thriller, political thriller, courtroom thriller.  If any of these types of books are in your milieu I believe you will find them enjoyable and realistic.  A few minor details contained in the book I could see coming, but these details didn't affect the overall ending and I saw them as superfluous so they didn't affect my opinion.  All in all you will not be able to put this book down and it will absorb you life for about a week.
B0029LHWFO|1.0|The content within this book has been proven untrue, this is not about Obama's family or his life.  The girlfriend in the book doesn't even exist, the story having to do with the theater and they argument he said they had never happened.  The magazine he claimed to have seen about the black man dyeing his skin out of shame was not true and the article doesn't even exist.  From beginning to end the book is not about his life or his family, it is a collection of fairy tales and should not be taken seriously.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|Awesome! Seriously, I quite enjoyed it. I can't believe I didn't take notes of all the quotes I enjoyed!!!!!!<br /><br />The Story<br />Atticus is 2100 year old Druid who happens to have a God with a grudge after him. Uhm, that's basically the story. There are witches with sinister plots, werewolves that are excellent lawyers, Gods who play with people's minds like they're puppeteers (or master manipulators) and a cute Irish Druid who is awesome with swordplay, druidic magic, a smart mouth and knows like seventeen languages!<br /><br />Likes<br />--The way the speaking parts were written. I loved loved loved all of the banter between Atticus and his wolfhound Oberon. Seriously, hilarious.<br />--I enjoyed how the author had the characters speak to each other, if it was centuries old people talking versus if it were young people talking. (if this makes sense)<br />--Loved all of the pop cultural references, made it quite hilarious at times<br />--Enjoyed that there were words that I had to look up to find out the meaning, this doesn't happen often (this is also a dislike as it took me out of the story)<br />--I actually enjoyed that all factions of religions were portrayed. Old Celtic gods, Russian, Christian, etc. etc. etc. Everything was in here! Same with mythologies, faeries, vamps, weres, demons.....hmmm, didn't get angels in this book.<br />--LOVED that there was a pronunciation guide at the BEGINNING of the book!!!!<br /><br />Dislikes<br />--It took me a few chapters to get into the book and get hooked (but once I did I read it straight thru)<br />--Because there were soooo many characters I didn't quite feel that I got to know the side characters as much as I would have liked (but this will probably be remedied with further books in the series)<br />--What else, what else, what else.....uhm, that's it :)<br /><br />Conclusion<br />READ IT :) This is an adult book, there are a few sexual innuendos and sex scene...ish. It wasn't in depth, it was more hinted at. Like ooohhhh, we're going to have sex, then cut to the pillow talk afterwards and make funny innuendos that sex had occurred. So beware that. If you like stories that mix all myths and religions together in one big thing with no overt pushing of opinion on what you should think, read this. It has action, fighting, bloody scenes, little bits of history and an awesomely hilarious dog (wolfhound)!<br /><br />Quotes I liked<br />\\"'So after I killed him and stowed him next to the doe, I sampled his smooth(ie) concoction in the parking lot and found it to be quite delicious' - See, sentences like that are why I nurture a healthy fear of the Tuatha de Danann.\\"<br /><br />\\"Whoa.

B000001C6M|5.0|SHOW NO MERCY, SLAYER debut is a raw brutal fast thrash record!!! Got some ALL TIME gems like DIE BY THE SWORD, THE ANTICHRIST, BLACK MAGIC and TORMENTOR... It´s really different from what SLAYER became on REIGN IN BLOOD, but If you like Slayer you will like this raw debut by one of the true legends from the heavy music scene!!!!

B000FCKGPC|5.0|I've read many of the reviews here and I don't understand why folks have such negative opinions of book #4.  In many ways it helped expand my view into Westeros and it brought forth some interesting new characters.  George RR Martin hasn't lost any of his talent with this book.  I like how the book explores the Iron Islands, Dorn, and Bravos. It also explores more of Cersei and her schemes.  House Stark might have been beaten and scattered by House Lannister in books 1 to 3, but everything is now falling apart for House Lannister.  This book does a good job of bringing the war in books 1-3 to an intermission.  The combatants are tired, scattered, and decimated.  But  you know things will heat up for a big climax by book 7.  The table is being set.

B001DJ7PMI|5.0|JFK: THE DIRECTOR'S CUT SPECIAL EDITION IS A MUST SEE AND OWN FOR ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE ASSASSINATION AND THE CONTROVERSIES THAT EXIST ALMOST 50 YEARS LATER. EVEN IF YOU ARE NOT A JFK ASSASSINATION BUFF OR A CONSPIRACY THEORIST, THE MOVIE IS SUCH A GREAT CINEMATIC WORK THAT IT SHOULD BOTH ENTERTAIN AND PROVOKE STRONG EMOTIONS REGARDING ONE OF THE MOST TRAGIC EVENTS IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
B004K4IZ3G|4.0|3 nitpicks that make this movie a 4 instead of a 5.<br /><br />1) The reveal of young CGI Jeff Bridges at the beginning just doesn't sell and looks bad (also on the TV shot where he's giving a speech at Encom). You buy the CGI more once you're on the Grid because it blends better with the environments. They should have kept the reveal of him being de-aged for CLU after the disc wars when Sam is brought before him.<br /><br />2)Tron should have played a bigger part and his face should have been revealed at some point: either when he captures Quorra or when he crashes his light-jet into CLU.<br /><br />3) The very end was a little too \\"Blade Runner\\"-esque, I wish they'd have taken those shots, added in CGI effects and particles of the grid re-appearing around the bike in the real world and then used that as a cool transition into the grid-looking end credits sequence. Could have been a cool bridge instead of a hokey fade to black.<br /><br />In terms of the product, the blu-ray is beautiful, it retains the IMAX aspect ration for a number of scenes and the film itself is a lot of fun!

0345803485|1.0|I'm an avid reader.  50 Shades (of awful) is the first book I read that does not have a PLOT.  Really.  NO PLOT.  Chapter 3 was the same as Chapter 23.<br /><br />The Story: There is none.  Except sex on every page.  It has the potential to be good sex, even hot sex however, phrases like \\"he cupped my sex\\" REALLY and \\"down there\\" ruin it for me.  Sex is not hot when you're incapable of using the words vagina and penis.<br /><br />The writing: Is elementary at best.  The editor needs to be fired. I have never read a book with so much repetition. I have never read a book with so much repetition.<br /><br />The Characters: one dimensional and boring.  Ana is inconsistent and annoying and Christian abuses woman for pleasure.  And that is NOT sexy.<br /><br />One of my favorite sayings comes to mind on this one.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.  I will not be reading books 2 & 3

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this book. So many people compared it to Fifty Shades of Grey, which I loved by the way, but I was hesitant that the storyline would be too emotionally wrenching. Sometimes I get too caught up in stories and it can be overwhelming to be right there with the characters when they're experiencing tough emotions. When I read that this book was about two abuse survivors, all I could think about was a codependency drama disaster that was going to violate my mind in uncomfortable ways. I'm happy to say though that I'm glad I took a chance on this one, it was worth the read and this book was able to take me through a comfortable range of emotions without taking me to dark places.<br /><br />While there were some major differences, I can definitely see why the Fifty Shades comparison. However, while I really really liked this book (it's much more grounded in my opinion than 50) I still think the story and blazing attraction between Christian and Ana spoke more directly to me. That's not to say this book can't hold it's own though. Sylvia Day is a much better writer than EL James and had Fifty Shades been written with her experience I believe that it would have surpassed much of the criticism that it has received.<br /><br />Bared to You was a refreshing read. Eva is a woman who has a real depth to her emotions, not the cardboard cutouts that have become so popular with protags such as Bella and Ana. The way Eva feels and responds to Gideon is intense but it's not intense in a vacuous way. Eva has a dark past and it shows through in the way that she acts and responds to other people, Gideon in particular. I felt through the entire book that her emotions were justified because we as readers had something to base them on. There was none of that crap about characters getting pissed and storming off leaving the reader wondering what the hell they're so upset about. With Eva, you know exactly where she's coming from. She has a great deal of personal insight and her inner dialogue is very insightful and mature, no doubt due to her many years of therapy. She is a well developed character and it shows. This really gave a deeper layer and a sense of reality to the story. Of course Gideon and Cary are also great characters. (I just didn't find myself swooning over Gideon like I did for Christian though). They all meld together in an enticing way and it's easy to see how and why they fit together.<br /><br />Seeing as how this probably also classifies as erotica, it bears mentioning that the sexual tension (and easement) between Eva and Gideon is just as gratifying as it was between Christian and Ana in Fifty Shades of Grey and the emotional connection (from reader to story) was even better. I'm looking forward to reading more about Eva and Gideonnsight and her inner dialogue is very insightful and mature, no doubt due to her many years of therapy. She is a well developed character and it shows. This really gave a deeper layer and a sense of reality to the story. Of course Gideon and Cary are also great characters.

B0058YPL66|5.0|Once upon a time ABC created a new ambitious show. They promoted it heavily and used characters we all grew up with.<br /><br />Who would have thought in the year 2011/2012 we'd all be tuning in with our families to watch the adventures of Snow White, Prince Charming, The Evil Queen, Rumplestltskin and more? Fortunately for ABC and Disney: their idea worked.<br /><br />The concept seems so simple. The Queen (Lana Parilla) is furious at Snow White (and it's not about looks!). She uses an evil curse and moves every character out of Fairy Tale Land and put them all in a town called Storybrooke in the state of Maine.<br /><br />A little boy finds out the truth and seeks out to find Snow White's daughter and use her help to break the curse.<br /><br />There's a lot of good episodes. Only one was meh (The Dreamy episode).<br /><br />Best episodes include:<br /><br />1) The Pilot<br />2) The Thing you love most<br />3) The heart is a lonely hunter<br />4) Skin Deep<br />5) The Stable boy<br />6) An apple as red as blood<br />7) A land without magic
B007J4T2G8|2.0|While this book was certainly erotic, the writing style is sophomoric at best. The story led the reader down a very predictable path that I found tedious. The only thing I can say good about this book is the eroticism does what eroticism is supposed to do! I will not be reading the subsequent two books. I can already see what will take place.<br />It also bothered me that the dominant/submissive relationship was a bit violent. Just my opinion, some might like that.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|The Camel Club is comprised of a group of men who are sort of a counter culture of their own after having served the country in some form or fashion, enough to be suspicious o the publicly fedf information from the government. They lead an odd existence, each with unique quirks and eccentricities, and meet each month to compare notes on what they're hearing from various inside sources. On one of these evenings, they unfortunately become witnesses to a stunning event that puts them in the middle of a situation that threatens the safety of the country and the world.<br /><br />There are several stories going on here that ultimately converge, which is an approach I happen to love for this genre. While it presents a challenge to keep up with all the characters, it certainly heightens the mystery, suspense and intrigue. There are quite a few twists and surprises that make it even better, ultimately leading to a pretty exciting climax, though I had some issues with some things in the ending. Political perspectives are also rampant with multiple points of view to keep it provacative.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and plan to continue the series.

B0074MZSWW|5.0|I have always enjoyed a wide variety of music. In my youth in the 1960s I listened to Sinatra and Tony Bennett along with Motown, the Beatles, 1950s do-wop, pop and rock, and classical, but my favorite music was always Soul Music like Otis, and Aretha, and Booker T.<br /><br />There have been few and far between popular performers in the past couple decades that I have really enjoyed, the main exceptions being Springsteen, Mariah, Bonnie Rait, and Norah Jones, plus a few far less well known ones like Loreena McKennitt...<br /><br />Well, I spent ALL last weekend listening to/watching Alabama Shakes on YouTube for hours at a time after seeing an on-line article about them.<br /><br />These [unbelievably] young musicians have thoroughly absorbed musical influences from ALL over and put out ORIGINAL music that is pure Soul with an added jigger of Rock and Roll. The band is tight: I was hooked in about 4 bars of the first song, but then once Brittany Howard started singing with that magnificent instrument which is her voice, I was moved by the discovery of a totally new force of nature. She is truly amazing to watch sing! I wish they had a full concert music video for sale [there is a short free one on their website].<br /><br />The string section [which includes Brittany], drummer, and organist also do a little on backup, but Brittany Howard really needs no [vocal] backup.<br /><br />This is no nostalgia group copying other bands' songs [which is fine by itself]. They are reinventing Soul music for a new generation that has heard all the music since the hay day of Stax-Volt. You never heard anybody like this.<br /><br />I hope they will have a long and successful career!<br /><br />Note to some buyers who thought there was a 'problem' with the CD mix:<br /><br />I ordered 3 copies of the Boys and Girls CD, two for gifts. When they arrived earlier this week I tried the CD on my computer with \\"stereo\\" speakers built into the flat screen monitor and found it a bit disappointing. Our 20+ year old rack mounted, surround sound [5.1]and Dolby Stereo system is hooked up to our main TV and DVD entertainment center so I had to wait until my wife was done watching TV.<br /><br />The CD REALLY ROCKS on a decent stereo!<br /><br />Time to upgrade the speakers on my PC! [I'm sure Amazon will be able to help me there. ;-)  ]<br /><br />I hope this helps!
0385534639|2.0|I feel like this book was just really slow and never sped up. You know those books that you just CANNOT wait to pick back up and you become entranced with the characters and their world? Yeah, this book was not that.<br />I thought that it was a lovely idea but the author did a very poor job describing what exactly was going on. Even when the author did give the reader some \\"hints\\" or whatever, it was just all over the place and confusing.<br />I had very high expectations for this book and I was let down greatly.

0062197258|5.0|This was a very good book - very hard to put down. Cathy Baily met a man who she thought was the greatest guy going until he started controlling her. When she tried to get away from him, he hurt her badly. The last attack left her cut and bleeding and barely alive. None of her friends would believe her about this guy, and so wouldn't say anything against him on the witness stand, only that they thought she was going crazy. He was sentenced to a couple years in jail, and while he was there she moved to London and started a new life. However, her fear of him was so great that she developed obsessive compulsive disorder, panic attacks, agoraphobia, and anxiety attacks. Then she meets a very nice psychologist who moved in to the top flat in her building and they develop a relationship. He talks her into getting help for her OCD and Cathy begins to grow stronger everyday. Then, she sees an old friend, Sylvia, who wouldn't believe her about Lee and once again she begins to see Lee everywhere. He even came to her place of work to apply for a job. But Cathy keeps seeing her psychiatrist who is helping her overcome her panic and OCD and she continues to grow stronger. One night she comes home late to find that Stuart has been attacked and Lee is in her flat. She confronts Lee and he tries to over-power her. She knows that this time he will kill her, so she fights back with everything she has. That is all I am going to say because I don't want to give away the ending, I will just tell you that this book is very good and well worth the read. I can't wait to read another by Elizabeth Haynes. There are a few places in the book that tended to drag, and she might have been able to complete the story in fewer pages, but reading a few extra pages is a small price to pay for reading enjoyment like this.

B004VUP8WK|5.0|Illud Divinum Insanus is not what you would expect from Morbid Angel. It is experimental and creative. If you can get past the first 2 or 3 tracks which are OK but not great, you are in for a treat...Blades for Baal, I am Morbid, Destructos vs. Earth, and especially Nevermore are Legendary tracks. The CD shreds through blasting riffs and beats along with some creative lyrics and themes. David Vincent's vocals are booming throughout. I feel bad for the people who are dumping on this CD on the reviews here. If you sit back and give the entire CD a couple of listens, you will realize this is an astounding masterpiece. Good Job MA. It takes balls to do soemthing different and creative. I think long term you will be vindicated by the true fans...

B0053O89KG|5.0|This season kicked it back a gear form the mature setting covered in season 3.  There were still dark moments to be had in season 4, but the majority rallied on beckett's and castle's feelings and light-hearted cases.  It really did go back to season 1 comedy for a good amount of the episodes, which I loved.  I'm sad to see the writer Will Beall go, but marlowe maintains that excellent charm and witty writing throughout the episodes.  If you're a castle fan, you need to get this!!

0670023329|5.0|Animals. Man and government treating people worse than animals, twisting their brains physically and emotionally. I am not a war monger but reading this book makes me want the U.S. military to go all in and just destroy the leadership.

God helped Shin escape to tell this horrible tale. No more! Let's stop this!
0374158460|5.0|Freedom was my first experience reading Jonathan Franzen. I'm one of the few people who enjoys literary fiction but who hasn't (yet) read The Corrections, nor have I read Franzen's two prior novels. I wasn't victim to the hype either; I didn't even know Freedom was coming out, and the media outlets that would hype such a book are outside my sphere of influence: I don't own a TV, so I didn't see it on Oprah or Charlie Rose; I don't often listen to NPR; I don't subscribe to the Times or The New Yorker or any similar publications; and my Internet exposure is generally relegated to Twitter, some independent acoustic music, and a few blogs.<br /><br />Instead, I saw the book in a bookstore window--sure, I know what you're thinking: if it weren't such a hyped book, then it wouldn't have been in the window for you to see in the first place. And I have no way to argue against that point--while I was walking down the street and Franzen's name caught my eye, but not because I knew him as some famous mega-author, but because I remember David Lipsky writing about Franzen's visit to a suicidal David Foster Wallace in his pseudo-biography, Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself. I had been intrigued by Wallace's writing for quite some time (especially after his death in 2008) and thus was sort of attracted to Franzen's writing (Franzen was supposedly Wallace's best friend as an adult) by proxy.<br /><br />As for the book itself, only a handful of \\"current\\" novels--probably only Ellis's Lunar Park, Wallace's Broom of the System, and McKinty's Dead I Well May Be (the latter of which solidified my desire to write fiction, while Lunar Park taught me it was OK to be unconventional and Broom, by a 22-year-old Wallace, humbled me immensely and showed me I had a lot to learn)--have made the same kind of impact on me as Freedom. Suffice it to say, Freedom is the best book I've read in a long time. And it's not for the conventional reasons either (although the characters, plot, storyline, and pace are all outstanding). The reason it was so powerful for me was its morally-instructive and redemptive understanding of life. The story itself contained an expansive array of insight into my own life. Perhaps it has to do with where I am in my life right now--a twenty-something guy who is fortunate and lucky (at least ostensibly) but who also, somewhat paradoxically, just went through the toughest, most arduous year of his life (for a myriad of reasons that aren't pertinent here)--that made Franzen's erudite wisdom so appealing to me. Whatever it was, it moved me. And it gave me some clarity.<br /><br />Take, for example, the recurring theme of loneliness: \\"I did it because I'm lonely. I'm so lonely, I'm dying of it. And the reason I'm so lonely is I love you and you're not here. I had sex with somebody else because I love you. I know that sounds mixed up, or dishonest, but it's the truth,\\" (p. 406).<br /><br />Or the need to reciprocate love if you want to continue to receive it: \\"[Y]ou couldn't keep expecting wholehearted love without, at some point, requiting it. There was no credit to be earned for simply being good,\\" (p. 335).<br /><br />Or deeply wanting something you couldn't possibly have--something that wouldn't even make you happy anyway--and then realizing why you don't need it: \\"I've spent three years wanting a thing I knew would never make me happy. But that didn't make me stop wanting it. You were like a bad drug I couldn't stop craving. My whole life was like a kind of mourning for some evil drug I knew was bad for me. It was literally not until yesterday, when I actually saw you, that I realized I didn't need the drug after all,\\" (p. 375).<br /><br />Or how vast pain, while incredibly painful, also lets you know you're alive: \\"The pain was quite extraordinary. And yet also weirdly welcome and restorative, bringing him news of his aliveness and his caughtness in a story larger than himself,\\" (p. 407).<br /><br />Or how the pain of losing someone is appreciably different than having a desire to actually have that person in your life: \\"[A] flutter in his stomach warned him not to mistake the pain of losing her for an active desire to have her,\\" (p. 412).<br /><br />Or feeling weak for needing someone in your life: \\"[H]e lay boiling with shame and regret and homesickness. He was very, very disappointed in himself....It was unfortunate to have to need somebody, it was evidence of grievous softness...\\" (p. 430).<br /><br />Or for the need to be alone, for solitude: \\"Seventeen years in cramped quarters with his family had given him a thirst for solitude whose unquenchability he was discovering only now,\\" (p. 455).<br /><br />And the life lessons--about depression, about what freedom might mean to different people, about petty indulgences that can ruin your life, about sex, about cynicism and anger, about shame and regret, about guilt, about the genuine and irreplicable excitement of being with someone you love, about caring about other people, about selfishness, about self-loathing, about suicidal thoughts, about death and the potential freedom it brings, about dwelling in the past and how that leads to suffering, about the considerable differences between generations, about the exact-sameness among generations--go on and on and on.<br /><br />If you strip away all of these life lessons though, you still have some great characters within a great story that hums along at a great pace and would undoubtedly keep the masses of people who are buying this book entertained. I was very, very entertained. There are parts throughout the book that had me laughing out loud in public and attracting stares from people I didn't know. Franzen has an amazing, satirical, and somewhat sardonic sense of humor.<br /><br />As for the complaints about Franzen's lack of understanding of the working class that some readers and critics have alluded to, I'm a bit skeptical about that complaint. I just don't see Franzen's writing as a patronizing take on blue-collar life. If it's patronizing at all, it's towards the Yuppies who, no matter how much stuff they buy (or destroy), can never be happy. Or perhaps it's just patronizing in general, towards everyone that is, pointing out their flaws in a patronizing way. Then again, maybe I'm not your typical Jonathan Franzen reader--I'm a 29-year-old white male without a college degree who grew up in a small Ohio town with his minimum-wage-earning single mother, all of which seem stereotypically working class to me--but I just don't see a disconnect between Franzen and the so called working class.<br /><br />And for the comments and the hype about Franzen being the best writer of his generation (no, I'm not so obtuse as to not realize that some of these comments are said or written in jest), I haven't read anything else by Franzen so I am terribly unqualified to comment on that. It is, however, hard for me to imagine anyone more magnificent or more defining of a generation than David Foster Wallace, who is (at least for me) the writer who defines Gen X, the generation I joined as its door was closing in 1981.<br />Jonathan Franzen's Freedom gave me a new perspective for what \\"freedom\\" actually means to me. I, like many Americans, have always related freedom to independence or freedom of choice. When I finished \\"Freedom,\\" I wrote a note at the bottom of the last page. It said, \\"Perhaps real freedom is about finding the ability within yourself to give yourself to the people who are special to you, to contribute to the people who mean something to you. Perhaps that's real freedom.\\"ing someone is appreciably different than having a desire to actually have that person in your life: \\"[A] flutter in his stomach warned him not to mistake the pain of losing her for an active desire to have her,\\" (p. 412).<br /><br />Or feeling weak for needing someone in your life: \\"[H]e lay boiling with shame and regret and homesickness.

Franzen has an amazing, satirical, and somewhat sardonic sense of humor.<br /><br />As for the complaints about Franzen's lack of understanding of the working class that some readers and critics have alluded to, I'm a bit skeptical about that complaint. I just don't see Franzen's writing as a patronizing take on blue-collar life. If it's patronizing at all, it's towards the Yuppies who, no matter how much stuff they buy (or destroy), can never be happy. Or perhaps it's just patronizing in general, towards everyone that is, pointing out their flaws in a patronizing way. Then again, maybe I'm not your typical Jonathan Franzen reader--I'm a 29-year-old white male without a college degree who grew up in a small Ohio town with his minimum-wage-earning single mother, all of which seem stereotypically working class to me--but I just don't see a disconnect between Franzen and the so called working class.<br /><br />And for the comments and the hype about Franzen being the best writer of his generation (no, I'm not so obtuse as to not realize that some of these comments are said or written in jest), I haven't read anything else by Franzen so I am terribly unqualified to comment on that. It is, however, hard for me to imagine anyone more magnificent or more defining of a generation than David Foster Wallace, who is (at least for me) the writer who defines Gen X, the generation I joined as its door was closing in 1981.<br />Jonathan Franzen's Freedom gave me a new perspective for what \\"freedom\\" actually means to me. I, like many Americans, have always related freedom to independence or freedom of choice. When I finished \\"Freedom,\\" I wrote a note at the bottom of the last page. It said, \\"Perhaps real freedom is about finding the ability within yourself to give yourself to the people who are special to you, to contribute to the people who mean something to you. Perhaps that's real freedom.\\"

B001FAFO3W|4.0|It is hard to find this movie in stores so when I went on Amazon there were so many to choose from. I was happy with my purchase although the plastic wrapping on the DVD has about a 2 inch cut in it. I gave this to my sister for her birthday and had to explain the cut, which was kind of embarrassing. Other than the cut, happy with my purchase, and great price.
0142418471|5.0|John Green is my favorite author in the world, and, combined with David Levithan's fresh, distinctive style, this is an amazing book. It follows two 'Will Grayson's through their lives as they meet, leave, and then meet again. It follows both hetero- and homosexual romance, depression and happiness, and is an overall amazing book. Perfect for any audience- boys, girls, gay, straight, whatever. Although I would recommend high school-ish or above. So so so so so good. Buy it. Buy it now.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|As with most sci-fi films, I tend to ignore media reviews and just go see it myself. Because often the reviewer just doesn't GET sci-fi, and the review does not reflect the sci-fi fan's \\"sensitivity\\".<br />So, I adored John Carter Of Mars! Despite the fact the name was changed, the marketing went pear-shaped and the studio lost confidence. I was encouraged by the very strong supporting cast - Ciaran Hinds, Dominic West (who gave the film a great plug on The Graham Norton Show), Samantha Morton & Willen Dafoe. The main protagonists were fine and heroic - Taylor Kitsch brought surprising gravitas to his role (when he grieves for the loss of his family on Earth, it was heartbreaking) and Lynn Collins was sensational! A fiesty, lusty princess, as the Princess Of Mars should be! In some ways, I thought it was a shame the original name was not retained, as I loved the hokey-ness of it.<br />The look of Barsoom was well done, in an age in which we are constantly being confronted with other world scenarios.<br />I LOVED the \\"new, improved\\" John Carter on Mars (excellent in 3D), and the fact that none of this was hinted at or given away in the advertising, and I thought this was the strongest point about the character, and done extremely well. I enjoyed the sexy gauzy princess costumes and old school roman military style costumes - it all harked back nicely to the original ERB books and the age the books were written in, without sinking into the total corniness of the Flash Gordon remake (loveable in its own right for Dino De Laurentiis' wacky vision).<br />I especially loved the old-fashioned plot, which was retained - it's a different age which required the hero to be wed to the princess before any hanky panky could take place, but I appreciate the acknowledgement that that's how stories used to be plotted. No need to update everything - it still worked for this film!<br />It was a perfect adaptation, respecting the original source, era and vision of the author.<br />Look forward to enjoying the extras and blu-ray experience. And the sequel!<br />[[ASIN:B005LAIH3G John Carter (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D/Blu-ray/DVD + Digital Copy)]]<br />[[ASIN:B003CRM6QO Flash Gordon [Blu-ray]]]forward to enjoying the extras and blu-ray experience.

1439127700|5.0|This book focuses on the complex relationships between and among presidents and ex-presidents and between and among ex-presidents themselves. It has found a niche that has supplied interesting historical information that I was not aware of.  The club starts with Hoover and Truman and the creation of the Hoover commission after WW II and continues to the present.  The discussion includes as necessary a brief explanation of the historical context to set the stage, but the focus throughout is on the relationships and dealings of the men themselves.  If you are at all interested in history or presidents, you should throughly enjoy this book.

B005LAIH2W|5.0|In \\"John Carter\\" we meet characters and themes which marked the birth of modern science fiction and inspired both scientists (such as Carl Sagan) and writers (Clarke, Bradbury, and countless others) in the century which followed the original publication of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels.  Disney's treatment doesn't slavishly parrot the novels, and includes material from more than one of them, but is as true to the original as the images in the minds of most of the millions of readers who have enjoyed these stories since their first publication (as \\"Under the Moons of Mars\\") in 1912.<br /><br />There's a sharp irony in the fact that Disney, the epitome of the Hollywood Establishment, was so badly burned by the Hollywood Establishment when almost universally bad reviews (and that can be read both ways) kept moviegoers away from what may be the finest Disney release in years.  If you're a fan -- and why else would you be reading this page? -- consider your purchase of this DVD a vote, perhaps not for Disney but for Barsoom, for Burroughs, for the classics of science fiction, and for those who invested so much time, effort and money in this film and might be persuaded to continue the \\"John Carter\\" series of films in the future.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run is one of the most amazing and inspiring books I've ever read; I'm now actually tempted to become an ultra-marathoner! Even though this is a work of non-fiction, it reads like a novel and in fact is a page turner. After finishing the Kindle edition, I immediately purchased the audiobook and \\"read\\" it again while running. This may be the first book I've ever read twice within a single month! My only wish is that I'd gotten around to reading this a few years ago, back when I first started getting into running. Very highly recommended. Note that there are interviews with some of the main characters in the book available on podcasts - doing a few web searches while reading will aid your enjoyment.
0345803485|1.0|Just like the title says! I read to page 245, barely (only because I spent money for the paperback), and I gave up and put it back for sale. I can't believe this is a best seller.

Billionaires and simplistic virginal girls, completely unrealistic. Yuck. Don't waste your time if you really like to read.
140053271X|5.0|I've been deployed for a bit and can definitely appreciate a speedy shipment from the states (5-8 days).

0345803485|1.0|I decided to do the audio unabridged version of this book.  It's horrible.  I find myself skipping over so much.  This author has a very limited vocabulary and isn't able to express the \\"correct\\" emotion for certain situations.  I agree with a lot of the reviews that this book is full of repetition...I roll my eyes every time she says \\"crap\\", \\"double crap\\", \\"my inner goddess\\", \\"panting\\", \\"emails back and forth to each other that just seem to NEVER end\\" (use a damn phone!!!!), this non-legal contract that seemed to last 2 chapters of what she was expected to do and not do, etc.<br /><br />The character is an extremely naive girl that can't be older than 21.  How can anyone fall for a man that is going to be so abusive to her outside of the bedroom?  I understand that he wants to have this BDSM relationship with her, but does it really need to carry at other times?  And the fact that he calls her \\"Miss Steel\\" while they are in the act...is disgusting.  Every single time they are together it is so formal that it makes my skin crawl.  How is that erotic?  There is no relationship.  Just a contractual obligation between an arrogant, self-absorbed, jerk getting his rocks off 24/7 with a visibly inexperienced, naive idiot.<br /><br />This book is absolutely horrible.  The only reason that it's won awards is because it \\"barely\\" pushes the envelope of this alternative lifestyle.

Thanks guys, you rock!
055338466X|5.0|Is philosophy dead?  Stephen Hawking thinks it is.  In his view, philosophy hasn't kept pace with science.  According to Hawking, the ability to answer the big questions in life -- why we exist, why there is something rather than nothing -- resides in physics rather than philosophy (sort of an odd position, given the extent to which he creates a science-based philosophy in the concluding chapters).  Together with his coauthor, Hawking suggests the answers to those questions in a short but surprisingly readable book that I, as a nonscientist, almost convinced myself I understood.<br /><br />If Hawking's mind is a sleek and speedy Ferrari, mine is a rusty tricycle with wobbly wheels.  It is to Hawking's credit that he can explain quantum mechanics in such simple terms that I can fleetingly grasp his meaning.  As Hawking says, \\"The quantum model of nature encompasses principles that contradict not only our everyday experience but our intuitive concept of reality.\\"  No matter how often I read about these principles, I never quite grasp them, but Hawking nonetheless came close to rewiring my brain with his patient explanations.  Hawking's writing is full of wit, yet Hawking is a serious thinker and The Grand Design is filled with serious thought.  His discussions of complex questions are insightful despite their abbreviated nature.<br /><br />Most of the early chapters include a brief history of science with special attention to physics.  Demonstrating his ability to pack an enormous amount of information into a compact volume, Hawking tells the reader a bit about the backgrounds and eccentricities of these scientists, whose groundbreaking work he obviously admires.  Admiration doesn't stop Hawking from being a critic; he repeatedly illustrates the unfortunate truth that scientists often become wedded to a theory and will postulate all sorts of fanciful explanations for experimental data that contradict the theory rather than abandoning it.<br /><br />The most interesting chapter addresses a puzzling question:  Is there such a thing as objective reality?  I hope we are not all living in [[ASIN:B000HAB4KS The Matrix]], but Hawking argues that there \\"is no picture- or theory-independent concept of reality.\\"  There are only models of reality, and the model that fits best with our observations at this moment is the one we choose to call reality.  Different models of reality might be equally valid under different conditions, a notion that rejects the concept of an \\"objective\\" reality.<br /><br />Despite Hawking's skill at explaining difficult concepts in simple terms, I became lost (as always) when, in chapter 5, he discusses the difficulty of creating a Grand Unified Theory that would integrate each of the four forces of nature (or however many there might turn out to be) as components of a single law.  Once the discussion turns to quarks and Feynman diagrams and virtual particles, not to mention M-theory (the current best model of the grand design), I feel myself sinking into a very deep bog.  That isn't Hawking's fault, and readers who are more adept at wrapping their minds around abstract notions will derive more from the text than I did.<br /><br />I felt slightly less lost reading Hawking's explanation of the origin of the universe, despite the troubling notion that it is meaningless to ask what happened before the universe began because time did not exist (and \\"before\\" did not exist) until the universe originated in a quantum event.  Hawking's deft use of analogy makes it possible to visualize the complex theories he's explaining.  I was back on solid ground with chapter 6, where Hawking turns his attention to the philosophical implications of the quantum principles he discusses in earlier chapters (it's easier for me to be an armchair philosopher than an amateur physicist).  In chapters 7 and 8, Hawking discusses the likelihood of life originating on Earth (and perhaps elsewhere in the universe and perhaps in other universes, aswell) given the unique set of environmental conditions and physical laws that make life possible, providing a thoughtful and effective refutation of the notion (developed at length in Robert Sawyer's [[ASIN:0765322897 Calculating God]]) that a divine guiding hand must have intelligently designed those laws and conditions.<br /><br />I wish I had the sort of mind that intuitively grasps the principles of quantum mechanics that underlie The Grand Design, but for readers like me who are better with words than math and more at home with novels than physics textbooks, Hawking's book is a wonderful resource.  For physicists and others who have made an extensive study of the book's subject matter, The Grand Design is probably too simple.  It is more an overview of current thought than a groundbreaking treatise.  Physicists clearly are not part of Hawking's target audience, but I am, and I can recommend this book to those who are equally unschooled in physics. Philosophy might be dead, but ideas are not, and The Grand Design is filled with them.well) given the unique set of environmental conditions and physical laws that make life possible, providing a thoughtful and effective refutation of the notion (developed at length in Robert Sawyer's [[ASIN:0765322897 Calculating God]]) that a divine guiding hand must have intelligently designed those laws and conditions.<br /><br />I wish I had the sort of mind that intuitively grasps the principles of quantum mechanics that underlie The Grand Design, but for readers like me who are better with words than math and more at home with novels than physics textbooks, Hawking's book is a wonderful resource.

B005LAIGPU|4.0|What if ordinary people acquired extraordinary powers?  It's a tired theme, to be sure, but it's never been given the found-footage treatment.  I know; it doesn't exactly sound like something that would work.  But thanks the deft hand of director Josh Tank, and a superb cast, CHRONICLE manages to pull it off admirably.<br /><br />The story isn't complex: three high schoolers (loner Andrew, popular Steve, partier Matt) stumble upon a strange glowing thing underground.  They come away from it with powers.  Things spiral out of control.  You can predict what happens; the focus here is upon how it's captured.  The story lends itself to breaking away from the typical \\"one of the characters shoots the whole movie\\" trope (in some creative, and some annoying, ways), and the special effects, though at first hokey, become more and more awe-inspiring.  The acting from the three leads (Dane DeHaan, Michael B. Jordon, and Alex Russell, respectively) is above-par; very naturalistic, very organic.  You can feel them bonding, having a typically teenage time discovering what all they can do.  This is where CHRONICLE is at its best: three friends learning about themselves and each other, set against some unnerving superpowers.<br /><br />The film becomes a bit more typical in its final act; at first, this is okay--it's not as fun as the third two-thirds, but it's impressively rendered.  Then it just sort of dissolves.  That's CHRONICLE'S biggest flaw--it ultimately succumbs to the conventions it has tried so hard to flaunt.  When it works, it's very impressive (and I'm skeptical of the whole \\"shaky cam/found footage\\" genre; in fact, this is the first one I've enjoyed in a long time).  But the film can't stand up to the pressures of conformity.  And that's a shame.

0984183523|5.0|After trying to prepare with Case In Point and various other materials, I still didn't know what I was doing; practice cases with current and former consultants were average at best, and I somehow never seemed to really understand most of the feedback.<br />I found Victor's site via a google research, and immediately spent hours perusing the many free articles and watching his 6hour video; next step was purchasing his LOMS (Look Over My Shoulder) product, about 20 hours worth of audio cases + comments where you hear Victor grill and dissect CIB (Case Interview Beginners)'s performance. Listening to this about 5 times (i.e., about 100 hours worth of work right there) really took my performance to the next level; a couple more practice cases just before my interviews convinced me that I was ready.<br />I have the kindle version of this book, and could see immediately it was the same high quality stuff that Victor has gotten me used to; I am actually buying the paper version as well just to be able to put my hands on it at all times.<br /><br />What is Victor's secret? He explains what to do, then shows us why that's working AND shows us why not doing it leads to failure (e.g., start with a hypothesis, explain the structure & why you each piece will help confirm the hypothesis (or not); do regular interim conclusions as you move from one part of the case to another; start the final conclusion with the answer before the rationale... all things that really make sense but typical applicants don't do.  I know I didn't! Oh - and how do I know it works? I've successfully passed all 6 case interviews I've taken since then :)
B000007SPU|4.0|this has some great moments, but it can be uneven and sounds a bit dated now. I was a 4AD addict way back when but sometimes there can be some cringe-inducing moments of frilliness on this one, also moments of over-production, but I suppose that was part of the 4AD sound. \\"It'll End In Tears\\" is really the one to get. This is a runner-up. Still has moments of beauty though.

I think perhaps some underrate this because it's more accessible, there are no dirges really on this one. And come on, \\"Who Loves the Sun\\" and \\"Rock and Roll\\" are on here! How can anyone NOT love this album? Only some kind of purist would nitpick about this. And the cover art is acceptable, IMHO, if a little cheesy.

B000SINT52|3.0|For all the hate he garners, I still say God Bless Micheal Moore for going against the tide when that was a very dangerous thing to do. He does probably merit some criticism for being manipulative and sometimes, he arranges information in a decontextualized way that can come off as conspiratorial. By I really don't think this is a \\"Truther\\" documentary, just a scathing indictment of the laxity of the Bush Administration, that rightly had it coming. For him to accomplish this in the eye of the mainstream, at the time that he did, before everyone else was parroting it, took a lot of nerve.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|When I purchased this book I was certain my self-diagnosed adult ADD would prevent me from getting passed three chapters before I'd flip-flop back to the other books I was reading. I'm infamous for inserting incomprehensible Wah wah woh wah wah's over the paragraphs of crap that make books drag on for what seems like years. Not once in the time span it took to read did this happen. Charlie Brown's teacher didn't over shadow the imagery that Hugh has verbally painted, nor did my mind wander to things like needing to paint my toe nails or what I should cook for dinner. You don't need me to write a review 7,000 words deep to get that I enjoyed this. I freakin' enjoyed the heck out of it, then told everyone I know that's literate to read it too.

B000007SPT|5.0|Especially the stand-out tracks with Lisa Gerrard, such as \\"Song of the Siren\\". When it was released, this album opened up a whole new world of sound and aesthetics to me. It was also a relief that there were people going against the gnarly grain of the era by seeking beauty instead of just wallowing in squalor and dysfunction out of some need to prove their punkness. A few years ago, I saw a drag tribute to 4AD and they did a fine job of mocking the excesses of the ethereal aesthetic, but you could tell they did it out of love. This album used to be life-affirming (yes, I dare used that hackneyed phrase) in a very dark time. Indispensible album.

It's meant to be entertainment, people. Escapism. She didn't write this as an example for young girls to live by. hahaha. this is fiction after all. :)
B000001FFJ|5.0|Either this or \\"Swordfishtrombones\\", which is lyrically possibly one of the best songs of all time. This is Waits at his peak, before he started to really repeat his shtick. It has his humanity, his poetry, his great sound. And if I'm not mistaken, Keith Richards is on this (but I could be wrong; it's been decades since I read the liner notes) I think \\"Jockey Full of Bourbon\\" is probably my favorite track. A must buy.
B00110K62U|5.0|I bought this because my other copy is on VHS tape...no more tape player.  This version so far exceeds the recent \\"25th anniversary\\" production that it isn't even funny.  This is so beautiful.  If you love Les Mis, it is worth the money to own this.
B000005DQR|5.0|This was another musical turning point for me when it was released. I think for just about everyone else too. I think only Amon Tobin was able to carry the torch and take it further. (Not that I'm an expert in this genre, but sample-based music had some humble beginnings that do not always date well, if I recall). A sonic ground breaker in the way that My Bloody Valentine's \\"Loveless\\" was and still is today.

The sex itself isn't so bad, it's the fact that Anastasia thinks she can \\"fix\\" Christian's problems (at least 50 - he's \\"50 shades of f'd up\\"). When the book begins, Ana is likeable. She starts out as a normal-seeming college senior with a lot of independence, a fairly nice, normal roommate, and something like a future. The only thing unusual about her is that she's a . . . wait for it . . . virgin.<br /><br />Then she meets Christian Grey. So much for Ana's life. I guess it's every woman's fantasy to have their life taken over by a ridiculously hot 26 year old billionaire who has nothing better to do with his time (when not stalking) than have sex with his female submissive sex slave. I know the books are inspired by Twilight and began as Twilight slashy fan fiction. But Christian Grey is very Patrick Bateman-ish (American Psycho). Not so much the book-Patrick, but the film Patrick, portrayed by Christian Bale. It's hard not to think of chain saws, circular stairs, drills, and Patrick's lovesick secretary when Christian the tech billionaire shows up unannounced at the hardware store where Ana works, gives her a cell phone that will let him know where she is \\"at all times,\\" forces her to accept the gift of a car, also with GPS tracking capability, and even shows up to save her after she parties too much and hurls in an alley (I think it was an alley . . .)<br /><br />Pet peeves in addition to Christian's stalkery and Ana's \\"I know I can fix him if I let him suspend me from the ceiling and whip my privates with a leather flail!\\" attitude . . .<br /><br />Christian: \\"Stop biting your lip. You know it drives me crazy.\\" Seriously - sometimes 3-4 times a page.<br />Ana: \\"My inner goddess . . .\\" bleh. Bleh bleh. Bleh de bleh bleh. (\\"Did the dance of the seven veils.\\" \\"Did a mamba.\\") etc.<br /><br />I want Ana's inner goddess to do the polka, leave Christian, and get a life.<br /><br />That said, E.L. James does her work in hooking the reader in the beginning. I didn't feel this way about the book while reading the first three chapters. After that, the repetitive language, oddly-paced scenes, and to me, not very romantic stalking behavior, wore me down. I'm not an erotica reader, so I can't judge whether or not the sex is \\"good\\". Readers just starting out should know that Christian begins with normal (aka \\"Vanilla\\") sex with Ana, so the rough stuff isn't the only type of lovemaking portrayed. That said, this book works for many readers and E.L. James has a very refreshing and down to earth attitude. I just didn't feel good after finishing the book. I still feel a little dirty and downbeat, and I did not find Christian romantic.et a life.<br /><br />That said, E.L. James does her work in hooking the reader in the beginning.

B00418NVLW|2.0|If you don't have it, get \\"Boatman's Call\\"- very excellent album. Really outstanding.<br /><br />I bought this when it came out and thought \\"It's Nick Cave, how bad can it be?\\" Well, it CAN be bad and it is. The packaging was beautiful- I love good packaging- it's a silkscreened fabric box-- but the contents...well, maybe I didn't give it enough of a listen but I couldn't get through it. It had choirs and all kinds of schmaltz that I did not see coming from Mr. Cave. I guess finding Christ was not good for him artistically. Maybe if I picked it up again and gave it another shot, but when I hear a choir, I generally have to think they've hit the \\"We are the World\\" point creatively. The only choir I can tolerate, generally, are real ones singing actual classical music, or the Polyphonic Spree. Other than that, I don't want to hear it.
0756405890|4.0|I almost put this aside, but am very glad I did not.  Kvothe's life story starts off as bog-standard fantasy stuff--a gifted young boy gains a wise teacher who instructs him in the ways of their mystical world via the building block technique.  Nothing you haven't read 100 times before.<br /><br />It isn't until he reaches Tarbean, and starts experiencing real adversity, that the book hooked me.  So much so that I ordered book two immediately after finishing it.  It made me eager for bedtime so I could get an hour of reading in, something that hasn't happened in too long.<br /><br />You end up with a clever, brave boy navigating the unfamiliar world of the University.  I couldn't help but be reminded of Harry Potter at Hogwarts, but that's a trope as old as fantasy writing.  And the setting is the only real similarity.  The story stands on its own.<br /><br />Rothfuss has a real ear for clever phrases and similes. (I think similes is the right term.  I always get them confused with metaphors.)  It was a pleasure to read.
B000001FTJ|5.0|Lyrically, Waits is every bit as good as Dylan, in my regard. And the surreal narrative of \\"Swordfishtrombones\\" is probably my favorite lyric of all time; it's a 'story song' with a poetic bent, lots of wordplay and dark imagery and the brilliant rhyme \\"He got twenty years for lovin' her from some Oklahoma governor who said everything this doughboy does is wrong...\\" Somehow Waits manages to be cynical and human simultaneously. And musically, whoever this line up is, they're genius and provide the right sonic background for the stories Waits weaves. I've seen him live twice; really a true genius and this is him at his height. You won't regret buying this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book, or series is amazing!  I finally feel like an adult again.  I went from reading Chuck Pahlinuk and Vonnegut to Twilight...then further on to Hunger Games, and even though i did read the Shades of Grey series, (which although had adult content, the actual writing felt like something a 7th grader had written) I found an author that is writing books that I can read, and not feel the urge to hide what I am reading when another adult enters the room!  Wool has the pace and excitement of the tween books but in a completely adult world!  In his questions and answers which I actually read in this book, Hugh Howey comes off as a totally personable and down to earth guy.  He is obviously no longer a nobody!  Great book, fast read.  (Already assuming a movie deal is being made if the production hasn't started yet.) I couldn't have been luckier to stumble on to his works if I had, say, won a lottery!<br />Thanks for the entertainment Mr. Howey!!
B001VNB54A|2.0|dont expect anything like Band of Brothers. weak and dull non combat scenes, dont get to appreciate the characters and their roles. does have some good, but brief fighting scenes. could have been MUCH better-must have spent the money they made on Band of Brothers and used that series to entice you into buying this one. Best advice, wait until you can watch it for free.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Product was exactly as described. Holds and protects my KF perfectly and looks great too! I think that the price was spot-on for this product. Thanks Marware and Amazon.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I really didnt even want to give it one star. Really i do not understand what the hype is all about. If anyone even got slightly turned on by this book, you really need to check in with yourself. And to think that it has had 5 mins. of broadcasting on news stations, tv's etc., really disappoints me. We live in a world where predators are everywhere and this makes them look good and justifies what they do. To think that the author made millions on this book and the trilogies really distrubes me. Yes i was curious just like everyone else, i would skip pages because it really was disgusting and i will not continue to read them. Next person who picks this book up.....think about your daughter reading this.....then write your own review....i bet you would change your mind really quickly:(

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This is an excellent film depicting the way a cruel, Jewish, literary agent at Harper and Row, \\"Missus Stein,\\" toys with and tortures a gifted and naive young southern woman who is trying to break in as a writer.  Even after Stein clearly recognizes the literary/commercial merit of the work, she continues her sadistic ways by making a non-negotiable demand for a full manuscript in a completely unreasonable amount of time.  The director deftly emphasizes Stein's cruelty by having her layout her demand over the phone while gaily enjoying her evening with two male companions in New York.  Her terms and her manner of presenting them underscore her pleasure in having one hundred percent of the power over the aspiring writer.  I must admit that I am somewhat surprised that Hollywood would touch this theme of the cruelty and exploitation of southerners by New York power brokers.
014241493X|3.0|3.5 Stars<br /><br />Margo Roth Spiegelman has been 17 year old Quentin's crush for a long time; she lives next door, used to be his childhood friend, and they both go to the same school. However, they're in different cliques, and travel in different circles, although Quentin suspects that Margo is the sole reason why his band stopped being the school's bully target.<br /><br />One night Margo climbs through Quentin's window and demands he accompany her - in his car - in order for her to finish accomplishing 11 items on her list. He agrees, although he isn't told what exactly it is that Margo intends to do.<br /><br />After their spree, he looks forward to seeing Margo at school but finds out that she ran away from home. Because she had turned 18, she isn't considered missing, and her parents have had enough of her disappearances, and do not bother looking for her (I found that unrealistic, but it didn't really take away from the story for me).<br /><br />Quentin's sees it as his mission to find Margo and enlists his friends for help. Margo usually leaves clues when she runs away and Quentin is set on finding her. He becomes obsessed with the thought and tries to crack the few clues she left behind, one of them being papertowns -fictitious towns. This part of the story was kind of slow, but otherwise, I enjoyed reading my second Green book. It was less dramatic than Looking for Alaska, but quite enjoyable.
0345803485|5.0|At the first sexual encounter in this book I was unsure if I could continue to read, but I did and loved every bit of this book.
0470876417|5.0|Of all the business books I've read, Business Model Generation stands out as one of the most visually compelling and well-structured offerings. It takes a useful 'building block' template then expands upon it, using relevant contemporary examples of disruptive business cases such as Skype, Cirque du Soleil and the Wii, and important models and trends such as multi-sided businesses and free models. I enjoyed the discussion of design thinking and blue ocean strategy, as well as the more application-oriented end chapters.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I've downloaded and read about 150 kindle books (mostly fantasy) over the past year or so, and this is my first review. I had to write it and give this book 5 stars because it is amazing.<br /><br />Vivid world building, rich character development, intricate plot, emotionally complex. And very very good writing. All of the action, tragedy, love, and depth I want in great fantasy novel.<br /><br />I would pay way more than $1.50 for this book, so while it's still this cheap, buy it now!! Can't wait (but will wait however long it takes) for the next one.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I started to read this book like every other, but this is the first book I write a review on and first book that made me cry ..I love everything about it, its so real to life- not some fiction life-love story .

B0055PGUYU|5.0|I found this book to be an enjoyable read but wasn't looking for much more out of it. However, after finishing it, I found myself recognizing patterns of habit that I hadn't been aware of before. I agree that this is not a self-help book but it is an interesting look at why we do what we do.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is a great time passer and very entertaining it reminds me of zoo tycoon if you ever played that and I love how you don't have an energy bar you have to wait to refill in order to keep playing just a great game :)
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Disney gave up on John Carter before it was released. The trailer`s for the movie were no help and the marketing was nowhere to be found. I felt the movie was as true to the orginal novel as most films are. I`m sorry it failed I had hopes for many sequels. On to Venus
0345803485|5.0|I think that this book has to be one of the best books I have read. I read all three books in a week and I was sad when it came to an end. If you dont read a lot and would like a book to keep you glued to every page, this is it. I strongly recommend the trilogy to anyone. I usually dont read books like this but had to read it when every single one of my friends read the trilogy. It is easy to read, does not have a million characters and keeps you interested the entire time. Book 1 was good, Book 2 was better and Book 3 was the best!
B006JD48NM|5.0|The film, \\"Senna,\\" came to me very highly recommended and I was not disappointed.  I am told that I was engrossed in the film from beginning to end, but I don't remember that because I was too involved in watching the events unfold. Fascinating! -- Bob C.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is by far one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  No story line, plot or character development, not to mention the insipid middle school dialogue.  The fact that it encourages and glorifies what is an abusive relationship is very disturbing and frightening.

B0000TAZBK|5.0|This product took up to two weeks shorter to arrive than was estimated. Since it was coming in from out of the country, I was pleased. Also I was worried about packaging, but everything arrived in great shape.
B001F7MSG6|3.0|This is one of the noisiest fantasy films I've seen, the soundtrack all crashes and smashes and busting glass almost constantly throughout. The visuals are a feast, though, with much more going on than in many films of this genre. I'm not a big fan of Ron Perlman's Hellboy character, since he's the only one that looks really fake. The plot and the dialogue are secondary to the look. If you enjoy these types of comic book movies, this one should not disappoint, though it's exhausting to keep up with all the non-stop action.
B002OOG6YY|5.0|WOW! B Just....wow. I have never seen ANY BD look THIS good! Much less being a CONCERT FOOTAGE VIDEO!!! I have about 2dz. metal video DVDs and BDs. They all look like VHS compared to this one. In fact, I will have a hard time watching/listening to most of them now. If you like MM, high quality 5.1 sound, and crystal picture, buy this ASAP. Anyone rating this less than 5 stars, obviously cannot be appeased by ANYTHING!

B002AT8KB0|5.0|I have had this on VHS for so long that it was totally amazing to see it on DVD,the picture is generally good.If your a movie buff like me,and you have not seen Road Warrior,then you are missing one of the best films of B movies.Yes,this is a B movie,but unlike most B movies about the end of humanity,this deserves to be watch again and again.They tried to make movies in this genre,and not come close to Road Warrior.And if you get this,you will need to get Mad Max and Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome(even though Beyond Thunderdome was a high budject production,it still falls short of Road Warrior).Just buy it,but don't pay a arm and a leg for it,no movie is worth what some of these sellers on here think they are worth.
B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I HAD READ THE BOOKS THEY WERE VERY GOOD. I BOUGHT THE VIDEO TO SEE WHY THE MOVIE DID NOT DO AS WELL AS THE BOOKS.<br />THEY LEFT OUT SOME OF THE MOST DRAMATIC SCENES AND INFORMATION THAT GIVE THE BACK GROUND OF MADE LIZBETH<br />LIKE SHE IS.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun to past the time,  but some game controls are akward to use. then some games are just too boring
B007G5K066|4.0|This is a slow paced movie that may be hard to follow on the first viewing.  It is best when viewed several times.  It is somewhat different than the BBC Series of the same title, but it is well acted and tells the same basic story.  It is a story of deception and manipulation and involves very little action.  Gary Oldman does a superb job in the role of George Smiley.  The other main characters are easier to differentiate than the ones in the BBC Series.  A lot of communication takes place thru facial expression rather than dialog.<br /><br />I recommend that you watch the LeCarre interview after watching the movie and that you watch the BBC Series of the same title if you like the story.  This is a story best studied and viewed several times.  It is not for the ADD crowd that likes flying people, endless violence, and a simple plot. It is highly recommended for anyone who likes a complex mystery written by someone who knew MI6 well, because he was there.

I don't need Claire and Jamie's sexual adventures portrayed for me, it's just cheap filler material.  And agree with some of the other reviews, how'd Jamie become captain of that group anyway?  The book seems a little like The Perils of Pauline.

0060989157|5.0|This folks, is not a Cinderella story it's a Rock`N' Roll story which means that there are plenty of overly loud music, sex, drugs, alcohol, bad marriages, porn actresses, conquests, tragedies, overdoses and revival, tears,  tragic death, car crashes, breakups and reunions and swear words. If you don't wish to encounter such tales move along this isn't the book you are looking for because the above description represents almost the totally of Motley Crue's existances. However if you're a Hard Rock/Metal/Motley Crue fan, enjoy honest and sometimes shocking biographies or anything interesting, you'd be well advised to pick up The Dirt if you haven't yet. The highs were high and the lows were low, in this book lays all the dirt.<br /><br />There are three unofficial \\"acts\\" in The Dirt as I see it. The first is the band members getting together, recording their first two albums and basically being kids enjoying all the excess and debauchery that comes before fame, earning local recognition and realizing they were going to be the biggest band in the world.  The second act sees the band achieving worldwide success and their struggles with celebrity, Nikki's drug overdoses, Vince Neil `s car crash and jail stint, failed weddings and excessive touring. In the third act the band's popularity wanes as we reach a new decade, the 1990's and they lose momentum with the new Grunge/Alternative music scene, splitting with Vince Neil and being dinosaurs without an audience to play to. In this act the original lineup gets back together and Tommy Lee departs and there are more failed weddings. The Dirt gets it right because band members get pretty much equal coverage, some are more detailed and talkative like Nikki Sixx and some are more quiet and brief like Mick Mars but it's all good. What I thought was fantastic is how every period of the band is covered adequately and nothing is left behind, album or tour and approximately the same amount of space is spent everywhere making it without a doubt the most balanced bio I've read. Some books give higher coverage of the highs and the success and try to build up the legend; The Dirt is an honest coverage of the Motley Crue journey from then to its release date.<br /><br />The main subjects of interest here are obviously the four and original members of Motley Crue; Nikki Sixx, Mick Mars, Vince Neil and Tommy Lee. You might have heard of them over the years on tabloids and hum... adult videos. Nikki was the mastermind behind Motley all along, the lyricist and soul of the band hiding an addiction to heroin. Mick was the old school blues-obsessed guitar player older than the rest of the band that barely seemed human and hid in alcohol. Vince Neil was the womanizer who killed his best friend and was constantly with women. Tommy Lee was this trippy, happy-go-lucky, hopelessly romantic and childlike \\"dude\\" as he would say. Put those four different personalities in one band, add drugs and alcohol and you have 1) a recipe for disaster and 2) a really captivating story for a book. Nikki's chapters were the most interesting because they are so intimate and personal and I feel he reveals the most. What we learn from Mick is interesting because unlike the rest of the band, he seems to have a smaller ego and doesn't need or directly pursue attention as much. Tommy is this really lucky kid who got to live his dream and marry Hollywood actresses. The most heartbreaking chapter award goes to Vince Neil. The way he talks about his four year old daughter Skylar dying of cancer is saddening and very emotional and it's clear that this was a tough time for Vince. He has a son that he barely talks about and he makes it clear that when he lost Skylar his entire world changed, he didn't seem to care about anything at all except his daughter that is. I liked reading about Vince's career once he went solo and all the happened in between his departure and reunion with the band. Same with Motley, their short period with Corabiwas interesting to read about. One of my favorite parts was reading about Vince Neil's car crash that killed his best friend and everyone's angle on this sad story, no doubt Vince must deal with a lot of guilt even today. Then there's Nikki's OD where everyone thought he was dead. It's hard to pick favourite moments because Motley Crue, just like this book, is just one wild crazy ride from begging to end.<br /><br />Neil Strauss is a master of the biography genre, already had made an impression on me with some of his previous work notably Marilyn Manson's The Long Hard Road Out of Hell and he was obviously an important part in putting and assembling this book together and making coherent the way it is. What works so well with The Dirt is how the stories are told by individual members in an honest way, each taking turns to describe the events as they happened. What helps the book even more is the entourage of the band chiming in to tell their own stories. I can think of manager Doc McGee, whose contributions were highly readable. Or Doug Thaler, A&R man Tom Zutaut who got the band signed. Even John Corabi who replaced Vince Neil for the self-titled album and toured with the band gets a few chapters in the book and his story is just as interesting to read his perspective of someone joining an already established band that was in peril at the time. One of the best things of the book is the total honesty that lies in from cover to cover. Nikki's youthful hate and his resentment towards his parents is wholeheartily felt, Vince's chagrin over his daughter's death, band members hating each other, opinions, punches thrown.... The only mystery that remains at the end of the book is how those guys managed to get through the 80's and beyond and are still together. Oh, and Mick Mars! If there is one thing that could have made the book better it would have been more Mars, who is a highly secretive, solitary person and this book is the only insight fans are allowed in his life.<br /><br />As I recall The Dirt was one of the very first Rock biographies I have ever bought and it set a high standard for every musician bios that came after it. It was more than ten years ago and through the years it remains my favorite out of all the music related work I own. It seems to me that ever since this book was released, everyone who's ever been in a band has released or is writing one, The Dirt wasn't the first bio that went to the extend and earned as much success as it did (*That would probably be Stephen Davis's \\"Hammer of the Gods\\" on Led Zeppelin although it doesn't have any input from the band itself. Therefore the first rock bio to earn that title would be Aerosmith's \\"Walk This Way\\") but I think it has to take credit for the abundance of books on the band and the subject that have come out since. It's more than just a tale of decadence and rock and roll there's also a very human side to it and to see four individuals who seemed for quite a long time indestructible tell all about their fascinating lives and stories makes us realize how they really aren't so different from us regular/normal people.<br /><br />If there was sixth, seventh star I would give it to The Dirt, this book was a big part of my rock'n'roll education and the blood, sweat and tears found in this book are highly entertaining. I read this as an impressionable teenage fan of the band so, there you go.  I think even someone who is not into Motley Crue the band could enjoy the book but may end up being shock or think it's a just a \\"let's make a band, get drugs, party, tour, have groupies, record etc. and repeat\\" or a typical rock journey which is not the right attitude to approach reading this book, it's really unlike anything or any bio you've read previously. As a fan of the band and the music I enjoyed this book tremendously, what can I say it is a page turner whether you like them or not, approve of them or their actions or not. Fantastic read, if that's what you're looking for. The highest recommendation possible.br /><br />As I recall The Dirt was one of the very first Rock biographies I have ever bought and it set a high standard for every musician bios that came after it.

0061992860|5.0|I got the little version of this book for use in our camping kits. I was impressed by the amount of information they have managed to pack into the tiny pages. If you have vision problems, you may want to look elsewhere, as the print is (necessarily) rather small. The book itself was well-made. The binding was tight, the cover glossy, and the pages easy to turn. Overall, this is as great a book as it always has been...just in pocket size!
0470913029|4.0|There seems to be an endless selection of books out there that promote a particular diet, with a good number of recipes tacked on end.  'The Paleo Diet' is one of these books.  If you are vegan you'll cringe at a diet that promotes eating lean meat.  If you are a cheese lover you'll be upset at a diet that mandates going dairy free.  However if you are open-minded and read the author's well grounded explanation on why his diet is effective for both losing weight and regaining health I think most will be convinced.  Admittedly his diet recommendations are very challenging.  But from my experience I believe it does what the author says it does.<br /><br />I suppose my only quibble with the book is that it doesn't provide anything beyond what can be found on the internet.  The book didn't provide me much more info than what I already learned from online resources.<br /><br />Bottom line: a good book that promotes an excellent diet.  Recommended.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game to past the time. would play more but it gets boring and level limits cooking rates as well as the parts needed to build things.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I love this book! It's one of my favorites. I hope they make it into a movie soon. That would be awesome. I liked the shopoholic books and the first movie was really good.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|We, too, were SO looking forward to watching this movie. We found it depressing, disappointing, and hard to figure out where we were in the story. The flashbacks and present? Totally confusing. Gave up less than half way through. Alzheimer's deserves a more thoughtful portrayal.
1439153663|4.0|This novel is set in the South around the time of the second world war. It is a story or race relations at that time. It is set on a farm in a small southern town. Lots of twists and turns. I learned a lot by reading it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I got this CD for Mother's Day this year, after coveting it for quite sometime (thanks, sweetie!) and we've been inseparable ever since.<br /><br />Obviously my favorite songs on the album, initially, were the ones I was already familiar with, having heard them repeatedly on the radio, Glee and SNL. I puffy hearts adore \\"Rolling in the Deep,\\" \\"Rumor Has It,\\" \\"Someone Like You\\" and \\"Set Fire To The Rain,\\" obvy. After so many radio hits that I was into, I assumed the rest of the album would be solid gold.<br /><br />At first, I was disappointed. I didn't have that immediate crush on the rest of the album that I have on those first five songs. But I had a feeling it was because I didn't really know them yet. I couldn't sing along passionately and confidently with the windows rolled down while driving my daughter to preschool classes and play dates. Yet.<br /><br />I listened a few more times and I gradually began to fall in love with the non-radio songs from 21, too. Turning Tables, He Won't Go, Lovesong, Don't You Remember... and okay, basically the whole CD. Listen to it a couple of times and I'm pretty sure it will become your new favorite album, too! It's quickly becoming the soundtrack to my life - and if you haven't gotten yourself a copy yet, trust me when I say, you need to get on that!
B0055SWM08|4.0|the game starts off easy then gets harder as you go along. I downloaded it for free on my Kindle Fire when they were offering it for \\"free app of the day\\". You can turn off the music if it is too annoying.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|Ok I keep stopping and restarting and erasing what I wrote.  This movie is as stated very disturbing, not in graphic images, but in implied emotions, and happenings.  Potential Spoiler in review.<br /><br />The movie starts out really slow and disjointed, much like the review I am trying to get out.  When it starts it has that artsy European feel to it.  It goes back and forth and is somewhat confusing - stick it out, it gets better.  This is very disturbing subject matter, and I wouldn't recommend anyone under 13 watch it for sure, and maybe older.<br /><br />I think the movie eloquently shows the horror of what a Mother goes through in the after math of a huge tragedy.  Unlike many movies that show you what is to be the obvious victim people care about - this takes on (very well) the less easy to identify with Mother of the Mass Murderer.  What she goes through as she knows there is something wrong with her child, and the aftermath of the tragedy.<br /><br />The casting of Kevin was perfect in all the ages.  It was heartbreaking to watch.  I think this is a movie where 10 people can see it and have completely different views on it.  Some will think it was the mothers fault, others will think Kevin was completely at fault, others will see it as no one caught it.  The interesting thing is not everyone will be able to come to the same conclusion.<br /><br />So my review is I hated this movie because it was so real.  But I loved this movie for making me think and be better able to empathize as a human.  I kind of thought the Mom was always a weirdo, but the more I think on it the more I think there is so much that happened that was not shown.  I kind of thought Mom should have taken the kid to psychiatrist, curious to know what others felt.  The one thing I don't doubt is that you will feel something.

B000L212HC|4.0|In many cases, I end up doing reviews on BDs long after the DVD has been released. Sometimes, the reviews fall a bit to the wayside, indeed, since they are something of a sequel. But, in these cases, the review is almost as important as the film, no matter how out of time they are from the original material. So be warned - this is a rant that includes a review.<br /><br />Take the Prestige - a fine novel turned into a finer film by the Nolan brothers. In the theatres, the film captures our imaginations as it should. On DVD, there are many people who were just as like unhappy with the sheer lack of behind the scenes material, the prestige of the film, as it were. So now, a few years beyond this, we have the BD. Ergo, my review.<br /><br />Of course the film can be lauded for incredible acting and an amazing turn in cinematography, especially with the 1080p presentation. The sound is almost as nice, 5.1 as is the standard of the industry. But again, it is in the lack of the behind the scenes that dulls the brightness of this product. Don't get me wrong; they included a very nice 'Director's Notebook' that gave us the rare glimpse behind the camera. And there were three scenes, selected by the director for their arresting visual natures. And we get the same features from the DVD as well.Who are the people who decide how much bonus material we get on our DVDs and BDs? Nowadays, one would assume that the motto of \\"don't hold anything back\\" would have more drawn. After all, there are a large number of us who make our purchases on the merits of behind the scenes and extras.<br /><br />The Nolens are amazing magicians of film, and I hope they may allow for more of their own impressions to be made once their films gain their next life, beyond the lifespan of the theatre. As to the inevitable question in these cases: 'should I keep my DVD or upgrade to BD?' I would go with the upgrade, simply for the magnificence of the production value sunk into the sets, costumes, lighting and music. These elements live larger than life compared to it's DVD predecessor. But if you are hunting just for more features and optional footage, keep the DVD.and music.

B005LAIHPE|4.0|So I went to the Midnight showing last night...and it was OK.  I did not want to race out and see it again, I may never rent it (although Alexander Skaarsgaard sure was pretty).  So why 4 Stars? (Possible Spoilers after this, not that much in this movie is a Surprise)<br /><br />This movie did do a couple things really right from a sentimental point of view.  I am unabashedly a Pearl Harbor Patriot.  I own all the books on it and I cry at all the movies, and when I go an visit I am just a MESS!  I cry big cry, not little tears.  So I LOVED that they referenced the Veterans in this movie.<br /><br />I also loved that they had someone portraying a double amputee injured serviceman, and they did not make him someone you felt sorry for, thought it was great that they showed that he was still able to be a warrior.  That was FANTASTIC, and nice to see.<br /><br />The next thing I loved was and here is the Spoiler - last chance - that they made use of the Veterans that worked on the USS Missouri.  I loved them showing that just because people age, they are still useful, due to the knowledge they had.  Also - I loved that the Missouri opened up a huge can of whoop *ss on the aliens!!! Go Mighty MO!<br /><br />The other thing that I thought was great historically was being at Pearl Harbor and having us work with a Japanese captain to save the world.  It showed how far we have come since 1940's and our perspective and relations.<br /><br />So as you can tell for completely Sappy reasons, I gave this 4 Stars and not 5 because of the rest of the film which I will get into now.<br /><br />See it on the big screen because the cinematography awesome.  No way will your home theater due it justice, especially the panoramic ocean views.  I would go to a Matinee rather than full price.<br /><br />It was such a cliched story line with my exceptions above - super smart hot guy who is a bit of a screw up and enlists to straighten out, but then he is still a screw up that puts himself first, and is very selfish.  Let's his buddies down by being a \\"Top Gun\\" in his own mind.  Then (SPOILER) his brother dies (dang it, he is reason I went to see movie)  and conveniently every person with rank above him and he is thrust into being a Captain.  He still is thinking of only himself, but someone snaps him out of it and he starts leading - blah blah blah - pretty trite.<br /><br />They tried, but the dialog was just not as snappy or clever as was intended, and my biggest gripe - the inconceivability that they let his ship continue to exist!  So these super smart aliens have these awesome destructive balls that wipe out freeway overpasses and get rid of all the helicopters, yet they continue to let his ship float.  Just stupid.<br /><br />So with all that said, I enjoyed all the big blow em up stuff and effects - the aliens were morons for not killing off our tragic hero and Rhianna from the get go. Rhianna did ok - it was nice that they did not try to put her in a bikini or anything, and she did alright as a tough girl.  I would watch it at a Matinee if I knew then what I know now, and I would not purchase it on dvd/blu ray - because it just was not that great.  I liked it for totally sappy reasons that might not hold for everyone.<br /><br />On the other hand my Dad LOVED it - but he is secretly a 12 year old boy ;).st, and is very selfish.

B004QOT098|5.0|I am disappointed I live in the same world as people that buy a region B blueray, and then moan about how it doesn't work in there region A players. If you are about to spend money on a item I feel that it is common sense to first read the description for it. As far as why amazon would sell this item when it is clearly region B, and most people that shop Amazon live in region A; I can give you my personal reason. I live in US, the US version is no longer sold, importing from japan is expensive, I have a PC that I have hooked up to my monitor and, TV. That PC has a blue ray player, and I have software on my PC that is multiregion.

B00783NWB6|1.0|Shortest review ever...<br /><br />UGH. A complete and utter disappointment. The 3D was only slightly less impressive than the dreadful storyline. Best advice? Give this one a miss.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|The Iron Lady was a poor representation of Margaret Thatcher's great accomplishments as a strong conservative leader from 1979 to 1990. Leave it to Hollywood and Meryl Streep to portray this great woman as a doughty old lady living with her memories of the past. Don't waste your time watching this movie if you want to learn about Margaret Thatcher during her three terms as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.<br /><br />Meryl Streep won the Oscar for her portrayal as Margaret Thatcher and I give Ms. Streep credit for her acting. Too bad The Iron Lady script didn't give the actress material to better portray this outstanding woman and her politial career. Perhaps, that was the goal for all involved.

B000VUCIZE|5.0|Sam Harris has a wickedly sharp intellect and it shows in his very clear, well reasoned explanations for the positions and ideas he presents in this book. Along with being well reasoned he is passionate without being overblown or 'ranty'. He discusses all of the pertinent points I wanted addressed in a conversation on Faith: Belief, Sprituality, 'knowing', and how perception, language, and action go into and result from these topics. Really fantastic read and for being non-fiction, it is a very fast read that was hard to put down.
B007MJ9LA2|3.0|No vocals on this Santana album. With the exception of track number two \\"DOM\\" this album will put Santana fans to sleep. I purchased the CD based on liking track #2. I'm sorry to report the rest of the album is rather boring. Not bad mind you, just unremarkable. Just finished listening to the entire album. Yawn. I think I'll take a nap now.

B004SH40BQ|3.0|This is the second KOKKIA i10s. I've owned. The first was stolen (along with the 4G Ipod Nano it was attached to) from my car several months ago.<br /><br />The unit itself works fine with the new 6G Nano I just bought. It connects flawlessly with my two wireless bluetooth headphones. Sound quality is fine, although not quite as loud as I wish (this probably has more to do with the Nano than the transmitter).<br /><br />However, I echo the comments of many 6G Nano users about the short battery life you get with this. With my old 4G Nanon, which normally got about 10-15 hours with a corded headphone, the Kokkia reduce the charge to around 8-9 hours. Annoying, but not unbearable. However, like others, I'm barely getting 3 hours of charge with this attached to my 6G Nano. Kokkia's advice on power management is nonsense. By default, Nanos turn off their display after awhile. The distance between the Nano and the headphones shouldn't matter--does the Kokkia adjust its power up or depending on proximity? I doubt it, and, in any case, I wear my Nano on an armband that is no more than two feet from my headset at any time.<br /><br />But, it really isn't fair to blame Kokkia for this. If you look at reviews of different brands of bluetooh ransmitters, most state that the device drains 6G Nano batteries. Which suggests that the Nano battery itself is completely underpowered and not built to hold a charge. Which makes sense, because so many things about the 6G Nano are just plain awful that power-sucking is only one thing on the list.
0805086846|3.0|This classic reads like an American author's \\"final will and testament\\" to the white man's shame for the complete destruction of America's only indigenous culture. Its focus is on the end game of the so-called \\"Indian Wars,\\" which like all of the so-called \\"black riots,\\" more accurately should have been called white pogroms against red and black men. It begins with the forced removal of the Navaho in order to make space for more white settlements and to steal mining rights in \\"legally designated\\" Indian lands. The Navaho are tricked onto a reservation called Bosque Redondo in exchanges for promises of food and warm clothing. But instead (and as usual) they get nothing but more grief, as the rest of the \\"holdouts\\" are rounded up and killed. This scenario is repeated almost without variation for other key tribes for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Except for the summary in the introduction, which goes all the way back to 1492, the book is restricted to the era that began during and right after the Civil War, and ends at the turn of the 19th Century. Not coincidently, the loose ends of other racial business, was also being tied up at this same time. The reader may recall that the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued, in 1861 and then as soon as the war was over, and for the remainder of the century, it was effectively overturned and reversed (or \\"redeemed\\" as the Southerners called it).<br /><br />That these two racial convulsions came to a head at about the same time, I believe was no coincident. The Birth of the Unified white nation through \\"Manifest Destiny\\" was little more than dirty racial business euphemized as \\"Christian racial progress.\\" Put simply, American history is about little more than ethnically cleansing the whole North American hemisphere of non-white races. And in this dirty business, of his own making, the white man was taking no prisoners and no responsibility for his cross-generational shameful deeds.<br /><br />As for the history of the final Indian wars, the only thing new here is that it is related to us from the Indian's voice as that voice is filtered through a white author's prose. Instead of a single trail of tears, this narrative is the story of many similar trails of not just tears, but also a trail of gross injustices, official lies, broken treaties, wanton killing and violence, untold suffering and grief, greed and the coveting of arable land and mineral rights -- all done with no one being held responsible for what are clearly crimes against humanity. The idea that these crimes could all have been euphemized as \\"the inevitability of broad undirected social forces (such as Manifest Destiny),\\" is itself a monumental crime against history. It is very much equivalent to suggesting that Hitler's rise to power in Europe was due to the inevitable imperative of the forces of Christian progress in Europe.<br /><br />And as is usual, when discussion of the white man's misdeeds are raised, the prose invariably is cast almost entirely in the \\"passive voice.\\" So what we get here is a gallery of \\"mealy-mouse\\" phrases such as \\"the tribes were displaced,\\" and \\"surrounding areas were occupied and colonized;\\" \\"they were the last to be moved to Indian reservations,\\" \\"the government's dealings as they continued efforts to destroy, the culture, religion, and the way of life of Native American peoples took place,\\" etc.<br /><br />Stylistically, it is as if no one really wants to know who is doing all the killing, maiming, removing, and wanton destruction of a whole culture? Likewise, and as per usual, the \\"active voice\\" is reserved only for Indian responses, which throughout the book can all be summarized by the simple phrase: \\"the Indians repeatedly attempted to save their peoples by peace negotiations, raids (which is called war) and then by being ignominiously forced into retreat and surrender.\\" Stylistically, this book, which is one of the few that even tries to give the Indian's side of the story, still engages in shameful verbal sleights of hand, and in a complete lack of willingness to place the blame for three centuries of ethnic cleansing and wanton destruction of a whole culture and way of life, where it belongs, in the white man's lap. Three stars
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|My first complaint is that mine was missing a weight. It was missing the rounded weight that goes on first, attaching to the black assembly. I had to flip the others around to attach them and therefore couldn't attach the other round weight. So I ended up with two of the weights Scotch taped to the others. It was an excellent tape job, don't think that it was the cause of my next complaint.<br /><br />My next complaint is that once balanced, every single time I put the thing down and picked it back up it had to be re-balanced. This is because there are two joints that have plenty of wiggle room/play (which they shouldn't have). The main elbow that you twist to adjust has quite a bit of play which can not be tightened because then it won't adjust, and where the mounting plate connects to the round tube going down was also quite loose. I tried to tighten it and that did not make it any better.<br /><br />Third complaint is I emailed Opteka about the missing weight twice and never heard back.<br /><br />Another complaint is the lack of a manual. I mean really? I got online and figured it out but a manual should be included. Not a huge deal though and certainly not the reason for the one star rating.<br /><br />If they had included the weights that were supposed to come with it, had better customer service, and everything wasn't loose this thing would be great. But it sucks. I'm sending it back and I guess I'll have to spend more $ on a quality unit. Very disappointed.
0393340244|5.0|Everyone who even considers buying this book has certainly heard snippets of scientific research regarding male and female differences.  This book goes over these snippets and discredits most of them!  It's alluring and exciting, very well researched and extremely well-written.  I HIGHLY recommend it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I really enjoyed this story.  The characters were great. It held my interest to the end.  I've been reading  a lot about the old South and I'm hoping times have changed.  It's sad to hear how slaves and women were so disrespected, just to make money.  Everyone is at fault for this behavior.  Hopefully a story like this will make people think of how they treat their neighbors.

1905492073|4.0|Despite the various misspellings and redundancies (that at times make you feel like you are being beaten over the head with the same information), this is a well written and thorough account of decompression theory and physiology. For a beginner in the field there is no other book like it. There are times though, being a future molecular biologist or chemist, where I want to really know \\"why\\". During these times, it seems like I have to take some of the material on faith and don't have the answer to my desperate curiosity that forces me to ask \\"why\\". When this occurs I normally surf the web looking for my answer but can rarely find it. This just reaffirms the fact that there really is no other book that is covering the material that Powell with the same intended audience. Surely there are research papers out there discussing the same issues but those are rarely a good research for answering the theoretical questions that I have or the basic \\"why\\"; rather, they answer a normally obscure hypothesis with empirical support. Overall, I would recommend it and is completely worth the read as my knowledge (and therefore lack of knowledge as Einstein said) has grown greatly.
0345803493|4.0|The second book in the \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy starts out with Ana and Christian's future up in the air but they soon find they can't stand to be apart.<br /><br />This book was better than the first one. It had more than just sex which always gives a relationship more weight. Ana finds just how tortured Christian really is and he finds out that he's finally discovering what love is.<br /><br />I found myself crying and heartbroken for the little boy Christian and cheering for the grown man Christian is becoming. Ana Steele the heroine, exasperates me as much as she does Christian, the hero.<br /><br />I can't wait for the third book now, even though I still find myself skipping the repetitive sex scenes for the real meat of the relationship.
B005HSL626|4.0|I am slightly annoyed with the bad ratings, this game is awesome. the ads are a small annoyance but not nearly as much as people say
0345803485|3.0|Ana Steele, the heroine, is naive and headstrong. Christian, the hero, is strong minded and tortured by a beginning in life that should never be wished on anyone. I find myself wanting to cure these two of their stubborn self hatred. But when these two come together, good things happen and the world awakens them both in different ways.<br /><br />However. The first book of the Fifty shades trilogy is a mess of repetitive sex scenes meant to titillate but I found myself skipping them about 3/4s the way through the first book to stay with the actual meat of the storyline, which is good and gets better with each book. I'm now on the third book and cant wait to see how it ends, despite the author's inability to infer people have had sex and give us more actual dialogue.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't want it to end.  That pretty much wraps it up.<br /><br />But if I may share just a few thoughts...<br /><br />To address some of the reviewers who are complaining:  If after reading every page of this book (not skimming but reading and truly taking in every page) you are complaining about the historical inaccuracies of this book -- you didn't get it, the boat left without you and nothing anyone says will help you understand the meaning and the message of this story.  Pity because this is one of the best stories I've read in a very long time.<br /><br />To me, this book is not about Oswald and Kennedy and Dallas as much as it's about all the time in our lives we spend wondering, \\"What if?\\"  What if I did/didn't get that job?  What if I did/didn't marry?  What if I did/didn't move to Europe?  What if I did/didn't have kids when I did?  It's about realizing that while at times we may long for the past and wish we would have done things differently, we can't and shouldn't go back.  We try but can never relive things that have already been lived, or change things which cannot be changed.<br /><br />Jake was in a very unsettled part of his life.  He was in his thirties.  Divorced.  No kids.  Not dating.  And lonely.  And that's the key, right?  If he wasn't lonely and generally unhappy, he never would have considered travelling back to begin with.  In fact, he never even would have been in the position to have gained the knowledge that he could go back.<br /><br />Much of the book is spent in a much sunnier and brighter place than Jake had grown accustomed before his trip.  School plays, a sense of community.  Heck, I longed for where Jake went!  The grass was definitely greener.  But was it really?  Or was it just different, with some different good and some different bad?  People seemed much less cynical, but a whole lot more judgmental.  The community seemed closer, but also more closed to people who didn't look or behave like them.  There weren't cell phonesor other technology to distract you from spending time with the people you loved, but there weren't cell phones when you needed one in an emergency either.  Just a few examples of taking the good with the bad.<br /><br />Listen, maybe I read a whole lot more into this book than was intended.  Maybe this really is a story about what if Oswald didn't kill Kennedy.  But I don't think so.  I think this is a story which reminds us that in more difficult times we tend to look at the past quite fondly but choose not to remember that the past is the past for a reason.  And while it may be a nice place to visit occasionally, the more time we spend there, the more we lose of our future.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I was disappointed that the main characters were left hanging.  No conclusion to any of their stories.  I wonder what the wait till book six?
B0042H6VY6|5.0|ANOTHER Pet Shop Boys disc for my collection!  I LOVE Them and this CD is amazing as all of their CDs are!  If you are a fan, I shouldn't have to recommend this to you, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO ANYONE!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is awesome.Ps you can get out of it by going to the option scroll on the right. then you can see the arrow that. let's. you go to home screen.so I think this game is the best
0553386794|5.0|Some books you want to see on the big or in this case the small screen, but some are better left to the perseption of the reader. There are always differances and things left out or added so...  this is an excellent read and takes it's place on the book shelf next to the Lord of the rings and the Hobitt.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible I use it everyday. If you haven't. try it yet go ahead and try it out.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love this App. The App provides many different peaceful sounds to help you relax or sleep. There is zero set - up required and the App runs very smoothly.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|very good game with many levels to play, its just a great app!! once you get a lot of levels complete you will be happy!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|its time consuming, you gotta get it. You can play offline as well as online. And it has great quality features.
1594744769|5.0|i would definitely recommend having the book rather than the kindle. it is just so unique and beautiful, i think that something would be lost in kindle form. i bought a copy for myself and my 8 year old niece. she is a voracious reader and loved the book, but found the beginning a bit scary. otherwise she loved it. i love old photos and i thought that the concept for this book was just really clever. highly recommended!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i wish the level updates happened the same time as the apple appstore and other places...<br />like i still cant get the space update on my kindle even though i sync daily
B001NLKT60|4.0|Another pretty solid pageturner from Stieg Larsson. I give a slight edge to Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, because this one takes a little longer to get into. I felt like I was halfway through the book before I knew what the main story was going to be. Salander is a great character, and when she goes missing halfway through the book you're just waiting for her to be re-introduced. It's a long book but an easy read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read several books from classical romance to erotica and paranormal romance novels. Fifty Shades is in a class of its own, I cannot compare it to any of the other books I have read. I fell in love with Christian Grey and god bless little Ana.... I purchased only the first book, but halfway thru, I purchased the other two, the only bad thing about this series is that it is going to end!
B007VGXS8M|5.0|For those who get frozen on the start screen, I really feel bad for you. This game is EXTREMELY fun (in my opinion, at least) and I love it. Admittedly, it got stuck once, but all you need to do is hold the start button of your Kindle Fire for fifteen seconds, then turn it back on and try again. If that doesn't work, I don't know what will, but my point here is that I love this game. I recommend this to any Waldo fan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. it is easy for me to pass all the games so I'm almost finished!!!! I love it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What more can I say... All three books were fantastic, incredible, amazing with a great story line. I love reading trilogies.
B0049IHX2C|5.0|I loved the first MIB movie, just like everyone else did. What haters of MIB 2 don't get is how fun the homages are, beginning with the opening with Peter Graves. Tipping his hat to Ed Wood and \\"Forbidden Planet, the pre-credits bit sets the stage for a film that loses nothing from the comic tone of the first, but gains a lot in pure fun (especially the \\"worms\\"). Smart casting makes this one a major winner, even better than the first.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Fantastic! I read the first book, The Hunger Games in less than one week and it left me wanting more. I couldn't put it down, it was as good as the first book and kept me on the edge of my seat. An easy read, and I highly recommend all three books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoy playing.  Especially. good while waiting for an appointment!<br />I think you will like it if you love to play cards or games<br />in general.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love this game! it is more challenging than regular solitaire and more fun.  it is hard to believe it is free!!
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|If you like Train, you will like this CD... another set of songs with fun tunes and wordplay.  I recommend 'Bruises'
B0054JZC6E|4.0|something for everyone. very fun. it is great to play for adults or children together. what I am not good at my daughter is. makes us both feel good.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book after hearing all the hype and now I regret wasting my time and money. How can women fall for a man who is violent, a stalker, and possessive? She is always afraid of him being mad at her and hurting her. Is this the kind of men women like now? I will not be purchasing the next two books. It is a shame that a book this horrible is selling so well when it has poor quality of writing and no substance.
B00846F1YW|5.0|this game is very fun. enough time to find objects and nice areas for searching. definitely recommend for people who like hidden object games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really love this it gives me so many different choices in games that I want to play...I don't have any problems with it freezing or force closing def download
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fantastic thinking game. Needs more levels. I love that you can earn solutions to skip over the more boring levels and only focus on the fun ones.  Runs very smooth on evo 4g
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw Hunger Games at the movies first then read the book. I must say that I'm glad I saw the movie before reading because it gave me the visuals I needed to really enjoy the book. There were some differences but still great......so much so that I read the other two books as well. I don't read books that often......have to be in the mood for them but I read all 3 in less than a month. Thanks for the great adventure.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Daughters loved it. Great quality and color! Any princess loving child would want this on their walls! Easy to apply.
0312430000|5.0|Many reviewers already identified the value of this book -- that checklists provide a systematic method of thinking about the world.  Checklists, when used properly, can slow down the thinking process and force people to make their thinking more deliberate before taking action.  This book deserves consideration from everyone making decisions of any kind, and it is concise enough to be accessible to even the busiest person.  Gawande's book reads like a long magazine article, which makes it perfect for a plane ride or a few minutes before bed every night for a couple of weeks.<br /><br />Recommended.
076781214X|5.0|Would definitely purchase more movies from this seller! I hadn't seen this movie since I was a little girl, and watching it brought back some good little memories!
B0076LAF24|5.0|I you haven't see them live, this is like being there... front row or even better from all the angles it was shot. Good stuff!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great free app for difffering versions of God's word. Easy to find verses and has a daily reading plan. Definitely a &quot;Recommend&quot;.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After watching the movie Hunger Games, I just had to find out what happens next. I just kept reading until I was done with the very last page of the story. Loved the characters and their worlds. I appreciated the story even more when I read Suzanne's bio. She mentions how her dad was always talking about war and peace, and yes, human are not the best at handling peace. It's creative, loved the tension, had me on the edge of my seat from cover to cover.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game!! It is so much fun! the only bad thing is you lose energy fast and you can barely do anything without energy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After watching the movie Hunger Games, I just had to find out what happens next. I read this book and the next one in only a few days. Great stories, very original. I appreciated the story even more when I read Suzanne's bio. She mentions how her dad was always talking about war and peace, and yes, human are not the best at handling peace. Very creative, loved the tension, had me on the edge of my seat from cover to cover.
B000002J1B|5.0|Relayer became my favorite Yes album kind of by default, as it was during the Relayer tour in 1975 that I first saw the band live, and if anyone else remembers the spectacular shows that Yes was doing back then, you'll understand how it could have affected me at 17 years of age. Totally blew me away and changed my way of hearing music from then on. Yes became something to me at that time in my life. There are so many great moments all through Relayer, but Gates of Delirium really put it over the top for me, especially live, in a big stadium (Roosevelt Stadium 1975 & 76), with big sound and a big production!<br />  Of course, those days are gone forever, but at least I still have some of my memory left of those incredible times!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been very impressed with all the translations available in this app.  Wonderful for bible study!  Thank you YouVersion!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|it is fun for all ages but i wish my energy lasted a lot longer i dont want to pay for it
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a great game for playing on your breaks at work, as you can easily blow right through the energy you've accummulated while you've been away from the game. However, while you have the in-game energy, it can be hopelessly addictive to play. There's just one very large flaw that others have mentioned and that I hope the most recent update has fixed, and that's the timer reset on the game that suddenly can add 144 hours to the wait you have until you can play again. If the update's fixed that, the game's earned the four stars I gave it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|i found that after this particular epsoide, there isn't any need for therapy...the show centers around sheldon's character ( the know it all ) knowing the cricket that is heard by: sheldon, howard and rajesh, is none other than the snowy tree cricket. sheldon, thinking all will just take his word for it, goes back to the conversation they were having, only to be challenged by howard. howard tells sheldon he may know allot but this he ( howard wolowitz ) knows the cricket is a common field cricket. sheldon ( of course argues ) until they bet on who is right. then the fun begins...rajesh brings up the point of having to find said cricket in order to solve the bet. the part where the three get caught in the closet!!!! i still can't watch without pausing the tv so that i can stop laughing long enough to BREATH? i love just about all the epsoides,but i believe the bet on tree cricket's is the best. review by madhattercyn
B000E116CQ|5.0|A gift for my son who did not believe that is still vinyl and the sound is better than CD. Now he can compare with one of his favorite bands. Long live the LP's!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|awesome game, easy controls, Glu hits again! make sure to let the upgrade meter charge up, makes game easier. 3 days later and i'm level 40.
0670022411|4.0|I think this is the most underrated book on Amazon! But I think I know why the bad reviews were created.<br />The book is amazing, and I would definately would have given it 5 stars but for certain aspects of the book, but I think parts of the book made some people, especially men, uncomfortable given the extremely detailed romantic impulses and actions of the female protagonist and her lover. OTHER THAN THAT this book was the best book I have read in YEARS and thoroughly enjoyed it. In most of the incredible fiction books I have read the romance and feelings of possession of the main characters stops at a certain point and is not a featured part of the book, but this book definately may make you hate that friend you have that might be obsessed with her boyfriend and vice versa.<br /><br />However, this book kind of reminded my of a super-upgraded version of Twilight, and was so glad it was long<br />and there are two more books on the way! After reading a lot of disappointing novels in the past few years and<br />too many that were aimed at young adults, this was a welcome change! I just think a lot of adults might think vampire novels like Anne Rice novels are more mature, and the feelings of the protagonist could have been minimized and more action in the story could have been involved in the place of the feelings of possessiveness/and or romantic obsession.
B003L77G10|2.0|This is a great show, and it is a crime that the quality control on production of these DVDs has failed the creative team behind this show. I don't even have an HD tv and I was painfully aware of the fact that these DVDs were produced using sub par compression techniques. Just pop it into your computer and you can see that they've compressed 4 Eps down to 4.35 GB!! That's less than a DVD-5 can hold. This is DVD production malpractice. I'm going to be really cynical and saw that I can only surmise that this is a ploy to force people who want decent quality to purchase HD versions of the episodes. This season is not yet available to purchase on BluRay, but it /will/ be...
006056251X|3.0|STORY BRIEF:<br />Evie has been a stuttering wallflower.  Her father is wealthy, owns a gambling club, is sick, and will soon die.  Evie has been staying with her relatives who want her to marry her cousin so they can control of her father's wealth.  They beat her, withhold food, and keep her in a locked room.  She escapes out a window and runs to Sebastian's home.  He needs to marry for money due to his father's mismanagement.  He's known for having lots of women.  Evie proposes marriage.  She hopes Sebastian can protect her from her relatives.  He agrees and they immediately leave for Gretna Green and marry.  When they return they encounter problems from her relatives, a disgruntled employee, and mismanagement of the gambling club while her father has been sick.<br /><br />REVIEWER'S OPINION:<br />Evie allows sex only to consummate the marriage.  After that she believes he cannot be faithful so she insists on no sex.  That was ok and somewhat interesting.  But I found that Sebastian changed too quickly. As soon as they begin their trip he turns into quite the gentleman, very caring toward her.  Then as soon as they marry, he seems to want only her.  I would have preferred that he change more slowly.  He immediately became this ideal husband and problem solver.  I wanted to see more interaction between them before he changed.  It was nice but not enough depth.  The first sex scene was very good.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the conflict with Evie's relatives was so brief.  I was hoping for more intricate character development and underhanded activities from the relatives.  I wanted to see Sebastian and others initially at a loss and do unusual things to solve the problems.  The way it happened was too easy.<br /><br />DATA:<br />Story length: 368 pages.

B000WC4A8O|2.0|If you're looking for some affordable Led Zep vinyl, then just pick up some second-hand original albums and give them a good clean. Don't bother with these. Perhaps the Mothership remasters were done to sound good on CD, but on vinyl they suck. Bonham's drums sound like he's using a drum machine, and Page's guitars sound like a synthesizer! In comparison to my original albums from the 1970s... well there is no comparison. The price and the packaging are good, but that's it. One just hopes that when the eventually re-release the individual albums on vinyl they will be straight from the analog tapes or pressings with no digitizing.
B007Z9QS5K|1.0|nothing but garbage! waste of film. why was this made?<br />what a joke! why people say hollyweird sucks! nothing<br />but complete crap! watch this and your brain goes limp!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was just amazing.  The story is engulfing and I found it hard to put it down.  Fifty shades trilogy is a must read.

1607053888|5.0|I got this book last week and I made the large pleated zipper bag.  so easy and it came out great.  I can not wait to try the others in the book.<br />I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to make simple fun bags.  Beginners can follow these directions!
B0063IH60K|4.0|great app. easy to use and a fun free. way to pass the time<br />easy enough forty's kids to play
B002L4QP0M|4.0|A good story, very well written. If I wasn't already a Jeffry Archer fan, I would become one. I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
0307592731|5.0|This is a wonderful book by a wonderful writer.  I am writing this mainly to say how shallow I thought some of the other reviews were that seem to judge the book and her by some of the 'poor decisions' and problems she had in her life.  To me she seemed to be a wonderful and open person to be able to share so much with the world.  I made a similar journey in my life for somewhat analogous reasons - mine was a 6 month bicycle trip - 4 years after my wife was killed in an accident and some floundering in my life.  I think a lot of the wonderful people you meet on the trails of the world are working through some troubled times in their life.  This is the best book I have read in several years and I thank Cheryl for sharing it.  One part that sticks in my mind is walking thorough the snow for days working hard to stay on the trail but never knowing if she veered off and was lost in the wilderness- I have had that feeling and it really brought it back.
1936719010|5.0|Real talk in this book.  Gets to the very heart of your procrastination and offers practical solutions to dealing with it!  A must read for anyone struggling with any project!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game a lot really helps pass the time and entertains also I'd recommend it to anyone especially since its free that makes it even better!!!!
B001BN1ZHW|1.0|I am one of more than 400 reviews and it is likely nobody will read this, but perhaps someone can save their money on the bluray version if they do. In teaching a musical theatre appreciation class a few months ago I presernted this in DVD along the theatre version. Young high school students will love this one more; it is gothic and true to their taste. But I am not going to write a long diatribe on the quality of the piece; everyone knows that. I am a Broadway and Sondheim fan, and I do like this movie. I might not find some of the actors convincing (Bonham Carter cannot sing) but as a movie, drama and tragedy this is very compelling.<br /><br />What I am truly angry about is the bluray delivery.<br /><br />Having showed it on DVD successfully, I got this bluray version expecting improvement, but no. Perhaps the video is slightly better, but the audio volume is so low, I was forced to put on subtitles!!  For that reason, this is a disgrace and Dreamworks should be ashamed of themselves.<br />If you want a true awesome experience, get the DVD or wait until some idiot at DreamWorks wakes up and apologizes.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game very easy to work with lots of rewards the rewards are often. the baby's are easy to hatch
0805086846|5.0|This book is one of the most detailed and documented histories of how the pioneers, the US Army, and the US Government stole the United States lands from the Native Americans.  With the addition of beautiful photographs of the main Native Chiefs of each tribe, the reader gets to know these brave Native leaders intimately.  This is a book that should be used to teach the real history of America.  The only thing I would add would be maps of the various areas mentioned, as well as marking the various old forts, many of which no longer exist on a modern map.  I found myself going to Google Earth to get the lay of the lands mentioned and was in even greater awe of these Natives as they were chased hundreds of miles by soldiers who wanted to exterminate these beautiful people.<br />A riviting book, to be sure that will bring the reader to tears by the tremendous injustices and broken promises by the American government to this proud race.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This may be the best of the three!! I was so sad when I finished the book. It was almost like a ride was over that I didn't want to end.  It is crazy, but now we all want our own Mr. Grey. I am going to have to take some time off of reading because no book can compare! I need more stars!!
B007MLDC2I|3.0|After listening to several of my friends and family members rave about \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" I decided to have a look. I had seen the original so my expectations were rather high, and I was rather on the fence about this one. There was certainly enough action to make it worth seeing, and the special effects were really good. I would recommend this to others to see. I would also recommend that you see the original version, subtitles and all as personally I think the original was better.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I think I'm the last person on the planet to read this book, and after all the hype I was REALLY skeptical (I got tricked into reading a Twilight book and I still haven't recovered). That being said, here are my thoughts:<br /><br />This is a book written for a teenage audience. It's very short, simplistic and basic. The plot line is straight forward, and the action starts quickly. There's very little in the way of prologue or character development. The characters are very basic and one dimensional, and the plot evolves in a very predictable way. For younger audiences I can see the appeal. It wastes little time with flowery language, and you're right in the thick of the action very quickly. The story develops and resolves itself in the exact way you would want it to, without any real surprises or emotional blows, and the book is done very quickly.<br /><br />It's a fast read (I was done in about 4-5 hours), and fast paced and entertaining enough to want to keep reading. It's not a classic, it's not a subtle critique of humanity or our political environment. It's just a fun story... And for that, I give it 3 stars!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 games actually my faverite is the balloon one.and the games were very good the cool easy game was the light game awesome.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I love this game. Had it for almost a month now and got up to level 44 or something like that. I finally bought. some coins yesterday and got some really good stuff. I open the game today and its been reset. I'm back to level 1 and have no coins!!! Ive contacted amazon to get back the money I spent. never had any problems before I made on game purchases.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This great app involves mini-games that you must play and complete to get points which you later use to get more fun games. The games are fun and addictive,  but some of them are really hard as it's hard to get enough points on some. Overall it's a really cool and fun app! My mom played it and my brother wants it on his Kindle Fire too!
B0026RHR6K|5.0|Absolutely great!  Just wish there were a second series of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\".... and who wouldn't love a collectible cylon?  M
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a quick and easy way to get your solitaire fix.  I love the fun bright screen to update old games and the ability to play them anywhere.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I tried- I really did. I am a 34-year-old female, I should love a nice erotic story to get me through my dreary day as a housewife, right? I wish I could say that I was able to look past the horrible writing, the ability the author had to make sex boring, the unnecessary scenes, but alas, I could not. The story was slow and boring and the flow was horrible. I don't understand how this book became a bestseller unless it is because women by it and only read the sex scenes. I just don't get it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game would have gotten a five star if i didnt have to buy anything. other than that its fun and addictive.<br />I do like it. I would recommend it to my friends.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this is a pretty simple game, but it is strangely addictive.it keeps whispering &quot;how about just one more level&quot; .
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I loved Frontierville when it first came out on facebook,  but it had so many bugs and was so slow I stopped playing. The Oregon Trail:American Settlers is so much more fun!  The gameplay is smooth and the surprise events keep it interesting.  Great APP!
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|Who knew Santana could still play like this.  For me this is his best since 1972's Caravanserai.  Yes Milagro is great in the 90's but I think this is the best in 40 years.  I love that it's over 90% instrumental. Can't wait to see the tour this summber.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I wanted to like this book because it had good reviews. This book is not for a teenage girl. Travis (whatever) is a bully who wants to control Abby. The entire book was back and forth. She hates him..she loves him. He has issues and it is not normal to beat the frick out of someone that even wants to dance with a girlfriend. I kept reading because I was hoping someone would grow up and realize that the relationship was toxic.He needs her for everything in his life and calls it love. Co-dependent you think.. America (her best friend) was not a great help. I love to read and never post anything. I seriously think that Abby and Travis have a lot of issues. He cannot even let her leave his sight and if she does, he knocks the crap out of them. Is that normal??? His whole life is to make her his (yuck) who let's someone do that?? I made myself finish the book even though my eyes were bleeding at the end.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is great you can decorate your pictures and share then to FB and or E-mail!!!!!! so c00l!!! I &hearts; it!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|best app on my kindle. lots of fun! great for all ages and I am so addicted. I cant get enough of this game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a good book once you start reading you can't stop. Read all three books within a week!!  I recommend this book to anyone 18 and over because of the steamy scenes.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I thought it would be just as fun as the other \\"angry Bird\\" games..but it bored me fast. its a cute game, and even my little girl loves \\"angry birds\\", watches the videos on youtube, plays the \\"seasons\\" quite often, has stuffed pillows , etc...but she also didnt care for \\"space\\".. She likes \\"Temple Run\\" now as well as \\"seasons\\". \\"Temple Run\\" is a game I enjoy very well...
0385344228|5.0|This is a profoundly entertaining novel. William Landay uses his legal background to pen an intriguing story of an Assistant D.A. who suddenly finds that his son is accused of a heinous murder in an upscale Massachusetts town. Surprisingly removed from the case by his boss, the D.A., our protagonist, Andy Barber, nevertheless sets out to `defend Jacob', his son, while he and his family become the target of vicious slander and culpability from the town. Landay, in profoundly stripped down exposition, is marvelous at balancing the legalese with a strong familial component to this work while adding numerous twists and turns, to churn out a fast paced, page turning thriller.<br /><br />The overall merit of this work and one which is the overall draw of this book, to me, is Landay's ability to drive the reader through all of the technical details...the crime scene investigation and forensics are described in enough detail to be not be dumbed down; conversely these details were not overwhelming but embraced his families ever growing problems as the case becomes more and more complex. I was especially impressed with his ability to transcribe the `teenage' vernacular to where it wasn't too contrived as well as Barber's deeply emotional conversations with his wife as the trial started. Finally, owing to his legal background, the courtroom scenes were wonderfully portrayed both from a testimony standpoint and judicial rule perspective...again in just the right amount of detail.<br /><br />At nearly 400 pages this was an amazingly quick read and completely carried my interest throughout. I would have no trouble recommending this to any lover of fiction...I believe there is something here for everyone.
B004XWLIJS|3.0|This movie was okay if you are really bored. I much prefered the origianal. Jason Statham is decent but certaily no Charles Bronson.
B003B02O14|5.0|I enjoyed reading and thought it was going to end too soon, only to realize I was only half way through.  The balance of the story was intriging, each twist was very clever, and most were not anticipated.  Enjoy this light read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  recommend. to all people better then I expected. go for it. try it out for money cant beat it.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|The first part of this book was decent.  But by the time I was halfway through I couldn't wait to be done.  It was like watching a very mediocre movie where you just want to know the resolution.  I ended up skimming the entire second half.  In large part, I skimmed so much because the writing is bogged down in endless, overlong, and not very good descriptions of irrelevant aspects of physical locations and of the protagonist's thoughts.  I also ended up skimming because I could tell that the resolution of the \\"mystery\\" was not going to be satisfying in the least.  And it wasn't.
B001D0DQUC|2.0|This is a film that has bugged the heck out of me for years.<br /><br />Maybe I should give it another shot, but what's to like about a film that glorifies a narcissistic jerk who cuts class, disrespects everyone in his life, and pursues a crazy adventure that you know he's going to get in trouble for?<br /><br />Why exactly do people think this is a classic? If I want this kind of a movie, I'll turn to The Graduate, because at least that film starts out with a sense of restraint. This movie is a set of snapshots of an unsympathetic prodigal son, leaping out of the nest at breakneck speed with flagrant disregard to everything except his own inner pleasure-seeker.
1596912863|4.0|Jane Hayes is on a mission to disband, disillusion, and disconnect herself from Mr. Darcy.  Poor Jane has suffered through a string of unsuccessful relationships, and perhaps her obsession with Mr. Darcy is the reason she isn't finding the real love she craves.  When Jane inherits a three week, all-expenses paid holiday to Pembrook Park, England, she decides to use this opportunity to say adieu to her Mr. Darcy infatuation forever.<br /><br />Pembrook Park is a country estate in Kent, where guests get to \\"experience\\" living in 1816.  Mrs. Wattlesbrook and her team of actors and servants are ready to play their parts so clients are able to live out their Regency-inspired fantasies.  After a couple days of formal manners, playacting, and pretend, Jane is finding herself unfulfilled and desiring something more real than this land of fiction and pretense.  Is the reality of Mr. Darcy not living up to Jane's fantasy?  Will she finally break free from her Darcy obsession?  Can she find real love?<br /><br />I'm so happy I finally had the time (and the excuse to make time)* to reread this novel.  It delights me to say that after more than four years and close to two hundred Austenesque novels later, I found Ms. Hale's frothy and fun tale to be no less enjoyable than when I originally read it!  I love how Shannon Hale created this wonderful world, transplanted a Jane Austen Addict in it, and posed the thought-provoking question: Is this what you really desire?  I took great pleasure in witnessing Jane's journey and self-evaluation as she attempted to nix her Darcy-habit, throw in the towel on love, and indulge in a game of dress up.  It was a captivating introspection of fantasy verses reality.<br /><br />Just like in any Jane Austen novel, Ms. Hale did a marvelous job of creating characters that were likable, well-drawn, and eccentric.  One of my favorites is Miss Charming with her false British accent \\"what-what,\\" \\"spit spot,\\" and possessiveness over the male actors!  In addition, I loved how except for Jane Hayes, Ms. Hale didn't reveal the characters' true identities and personalities until the very end, letting readers experience the uncertainty and mystery Jane felt the whole time.  It was a very clever twist!<br /><br />Want to indulge in a little make believe?  Do you fancy dressing up in empire waist gowns, strolling through the shrubberies, falling for a haughty and reserved man in breeches?  Looking for something entertaining and hilarious?  Perhaps a trip to Austenland is just what you need!  Call your travel agent (a.k.a. favorite bookseller) today!<br /><br />*While one doesn't really need an \\"excuse\\" for rereading an enjoyable novel, having Midnight in Austenland waiting patiently on my TBR shelf the last couple of months served as my impetus in this case.  Also, I wanted get ready for the movie adaptation of Austenland which hopefully will be out some time this year or next year!<br /><br />Austenesque Reviewsaddition, I loved how except for Jane Hayes, Ms. Hale didn't reveal the characters' true identities and personalities until the very end, letting readers experience the uncertainty and mystery Jane felt the whole time.

B000I9YWDO|2.0|The first word that came to mind while thinking of this film was 'odious' but I'll do it a bit of a service and say it's merely *trying.* I watched it on Amazon instant (I like the service but keep in mind I am no hard-core cinephile, my concern is the story alone, not so much the technology) and made it through to the end.<br /><br />I felt rather ragged afterwards. The character of Milton left perhaps the biggest impression on me - he looked and sounded and acted like a Muppet, particularly Beaker. That was a very trying element in this film. I felt like I was watching a strange permutation of James Thurber's The Catbird Seat, told in a backwards way from some unimportant background characters.<br /><br />The protagonist didn't feel like a protagonist. The only really wonderful piece of acting was that of Mr. Lumberg, whose dry, grueling \\"that would be great,\\" stole the show. It was grotesque and hilarious.<br /><br />Otherwise, this was a legitimately unsatisfying film. I don't plan on watching it again.
B0000DYKET|5.0|I have owned my Keens for at least a year or more now. I feel in love with them as soon as I started wearing them. They are great for light hiking and walking through streams or light fly fishing during the summer. I wear them quite a lot. They are my preferred shoe choice. I used to enjoy my Berkinstocks for several years but they were simply slip on shoes and not designed for any wet situations like streams and boating. These Keens do well for any type of streams, boating, pool side situations. I'm not sure about wearing them in the sand at the beach though. I picked the leather style so I could use them for casual wear and going out on a date with the wife. I have worn these with wool socks before during the winter time as well. I highly recommend these sandals. I have a little bit of a wider type of foot I have read some other comments about these fit well for wider feet.<br /><br />I will definitely buy another pair of keen sandals some day.
B007HJB6OG|3.0|I really enjoyed the story line.  The characters are awesome and it's as delicious as you'd expect from HBO.  But I'll be honest...the finale was a real disappointment.  I really wanted to see Ned return in the second season to destroy the Lanister empire.  To loose the most central character of the entire season (and symbol of hope) was disappointing. And I loved Khal.<br /><br />Perhaps HBO did too great of a job in the writing, because I got so enthralled.  And of course I'm writing from the female perspective.  And had the season ended the way I'd hope, maybe it would've come off a little cliched.  But I have a feeling I'm speaking for many other female audience members here. I would've eagerly purchased the second season to watch Ned and Khal kick butt.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very useful.  I check it all the time.  Easy to use.  Well thought out.  I recommend to young and old.
B0055MI8K2|4.0|I really wanted to like these sandals, but went back to Toachi 2's.  The strapping system is much better padded and I love the quick release on Toachi 2's.<br /><br />These Terra Fi's have a more durable sole for pavement, which is why I tried them out.  But being used to extra padding and the quick release, I went back to my favorites.<br /><br />Hopefully someday they will make these with Toachi's strap system.  My ankles might have got used to the straps after a few days...but I already had a blister and can't afford the down time.  Bummerrrr....

B0050DIWFC|5.0|As a reader of Lee Child, Vince Flynn, David Baldacci, Stephen Hunter, etc., I've got to tell you that this was one of the best books I've ever read. Great characters, great story, great suspense. You can almost \\"see\\" this book unfolding before your very eyes. Landay has really got it going on in this one. Read this book.
B002RSQGQK|4.0|One of hitchcock's best with a timeless Jimmy stewert performance.  This is a classic to be shared with grandchildren, they'll be drawn to plot and suspense too.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cannot honestly understand why so many people rag on this book.  I thought it was beautiful and touching and it sends a message that war can and will destroy you from the inside out.  The things you fight for are always vulnerable and in the end, no one really wins.  Everyone loses someone or something dear to them in war.  Some people have said that Katniss is a completely different person in this book, and you know what?  She is.  She has been through some ridiculously traumatic experiences, so you cannot really expect her to still be the same girl.  Every good author out there knows that their characters need to change with their experiences, and even better authors know that those changes do not have to always be positive.  I feel like maybe I have a better understanding of what happened with Katniss because my own grandfather has PTSD from his time in Vietnam.  He doesn't have breakdowns often at all anymore, I suppose because of all the time that has passed.  However, when he first came home he was a completely different person.  He was paranoid and he often woke up screaming.  He would lapse into fits of rage and forget that he wasn't in Vietnam anymore.  It isn't pretty to hear stories about, and I can't imagine what my grandmother went through.  The ending may seem confusing and a bit convoluted because for the first time ever we aren't privy to Katniss' thoughts, but when you sit back and think about her decisions you soon realize that her thoughts were hidden because of her trauma and because the author did not want to give away what was going to happen.  Remember, if your answer isn't Coin right away then you are a threat.  Katniss was forced to answer the way she answered because otherwise she would have never had a chance to try to fix everything one last time.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the Hunger Games trilogy.  The author paced the story well and provided sufficient twists and turns to keep my attention.  While some of the characters' actions were illogical at times (even given the framework of the story:  e.g. arrows vs airplanes), the totality of the story was engaging and I recommend it highly.  I'd like to see the v2 trilogy come out (next generation, perhaps?).
B0045HCJG2|3.0|COBRA is the ultimate \\"bad\\" Sly action film, made when he was hot-trotting with Nielsen, an actress of dubious talent.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />As police Lt. Marion Cobretti, '50s throwback Stallone mumbles his way through sentences of six words or less. My faves: \\"Hey dirtbag! You're a lousy shot. I don't like lousy shots!\\" and \\"You're the disease... I'm the cure.\\" Here, Sly takes on a small army of \\"New World Order\\" thugs who have been killing randomly chosen victims with knives and hatchets. When Nielsen (in a bad blonde wig) scarfs an eyeload of their leader (Thompson), the entire mob comes after her.<br /><br />For no explicable reason, she falls in love her cop guardian, Mumbles Cobretti  and they \\"do it\\" in a cheesy motel room while the gang, tipped off by Nielsen's bullish policewoman chaperone (Garlington), closes in. After Sly wipes out several dozen of these Harley riding fiends without sustaining a scratch, the two lovers ride off on a purloined bike. This film was a huge misstep for Stallone, one that left him with the still persisting (if inaccurate) stigma that he's stupid and tongue-tied.<br /><br />Santoni reprises his [[ASIN:B001EC0OQI DIRTY HARRY]] (1971) role of the star cop's sidekick. In both films, he doesn't have a lot of luck. Robinson, who was the crazed serial killer hunted down by Inspector Callahan in that same classic picture, brings more than a touch of Scorpio's insanity to his role of Det. Monte. We're not sure why, but he passionately hates Cobretti and is constantly insulting and annoying him. You just know that before the final credits, Monte's gonna be spitting out teeth.<br /><br />Other character clich&eacute;s abound here along with a pass&eacute; and intrusive '80s music track and a plug for a Colorado brew. Unlike fine wine, COBRA has not improved with age. Only for devoted Sly fans.<br /><br />Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 IMDb viewer poll rating.<br /><br />(5.3) Cobra (1986) - Sylvester Stallone/Brigitte Nielsen/Reni Santoni/Andy Robinson/Art LaFleur/Val Avery/Brian Thompson/Lee Garlingtontte Nielsen/Reni Santoni/Andy Robinson/Art LaFleur/Val Avery/Brian Thompson/Lee Garlington

B001NEK2GE|4.0|i tried a console game pad and Nostromo, then got this g13.  i'm surprised these keyboard:conroller hybrids are not more evolved, but the G13 is further along than most.  rather than echo praises, let me point out a few remaining flaws in the G13's ergonomics.  the joystick should have a seat that can be rotated 45° so your thumb has more precise control - I found myself hitting NorthWest(W+A)instead of North(W)most of the time.  The two Thumb buttons above and below the Joystick are not keyboard quality - rather toy like keys similar to the crap found on any Nostromo.  The push down button of the joystick is too hard - or a flatter joystick head is needed to make that push down button more available.  people buying this for more buttons should be aware that many keys G7,G14,G19,G20,G21,G22 are more than one key away from your 4 finger home position, so you may not get much use out of them without glancing at your hand position.  while the three center home keys have a slight depression to find your way back to them, I would have preferred the center key had something more distinctive like a dimple as I'm often losing my home position on this keyboard - something I never suffered using a Nostromo.  I really wish Logitech had a scaled down version of all it's gaming products without these silly screens - I hate having them and having to pay extra for them.  So now that my rant is over - Let me conclude by saying this is the best solution available, it's just shameful that in 2012 with people investing $1-2k in gaming rigs and retiring their console games to the back of their closets - that this G13 is the best they could come up with so far...

I checked it out on CD from the library, but since it was 30 CDs, I knew there was no way to finish it in two weeks.  I still remember when Kennedy was shot.  It brought our little Oklahoma town to a stand still.  Since I haven't finished the book, I can only imagine how killing Oswald would change history.

B0002EXH4K|5.0|This was the follow-up to \\"Rust in Peace\\", what most people consider Megadeth's best album. I have to say that after hearing \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", I would say these 2 albums tie over-all in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"Countdown\\" maintains some of the thrash and shredding solos that were signature Megadeth but this time around, the band incorporates melody and experimentation. There's acoustic guitar on \\"Foreclosure of a Dream\\" for instance but it doesn't make it any less intense or heavy. They struck the right balance on each song.<br /><br />At first I have to admit that I was a bit weary when Dave Mustaine spoke verses on songs like \\"Sweating Bullets\\", but I really can't imagine the songs any other way. Dave has this way of speaking with such conviction combined with an insane aggression that actually works (he doesn't do that with every song on here). Songs like \\"Psychotron\\" are driven by spoken verses like I mentioned and somehow they sound powerful and amazing instead of coming off as lame or cheesey.<br /><br />The songwriting and musicianship on this album is right up there with \\"Rust in Peace\\" and on some songs surpasses it in my opinion. It's literally mind-blowing listening to the instrumental arrangements and the musicians playing these brilliantly penned songs.<br /><br />As for the bonus tracks, \\"Crown of Worms\\" sounds like a pretty good B-Side but not up to the caliber of what was originally on the album. The rest of the bonus tracks are demos and you basically hear skeletons of what would become masterpieces.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Megadeth and don't own this, get this as soon as you can.<br />If you're new to Megadeth, you can start here or with \\"Rust in Peace\\".

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book at the recomendation of a few friends. It was not worth the read. There is very little plot and the writing is simplistic at best. The repitition of phrases and words is mind numbing and makes the various sex scenes boring. There is an attempt at creating dynamic characters, but I found them predictable and stock. Don't waste the time or money. I wish I hadn't.

B004HEXSLI|5.0|Dr Jill Bolte Taylor reckons she \\"was to Nirvana\\". What could the girl mean?<br /><br />Some traditions of Buddhism say that Nirvana and Samsara are the same thing. In English this just means that you and I are in Nirvana, right now! The only reason that we cannot see this is that a blanket or a veil or a curtain has been put over our eyes. Some veils are thicker on some people than on others, enlightenment is when the curtain is lifted; so this is why that bloke you know is a bit thick; because he is blinded by the veil of ignorance. The Buddhists call our thick headidness 'avidya'.<br /><br />Ok this is very poetic and somewhat comforting and its different from the idea of heaven being 'up there'; but is it true? Well yes it is!<br /><br />All these Eastern traditions, as well as Freud and Jung, have been talking about the world of appearance, or the software of the thing. For thousands of years our brightest and best people only ever had access to the software. They achieved great things with the appearance, and then they died.<br /><br />For a few decades now, we have been working on the thing in the skull, the hardware of the world we call the meaty brain.  The results have not yet penetrated the naïve realism of traditional organized religion, and even science, however, the evidence is in; the truth is more shape shifting fantasy land than good old positivist Rock N Roll.<br /><br />It's been discovered that the brain is the firewall that regulates the experiencing software. They all say this; that if you inhibit the left hemisphere of the brain, like Dr Jill Bolte Taylor did via a stroke, then you are in Nirvana! I am aware that it's trendy to mix Buddhism with western psychology, but maybe the a similar thing happened to the Prince under the that tree, all those years ago? Who knows!<br /><br />Dr Taylor is no Oprah cash cow reject, far from it. She is a fully paid up member if the scientific community, as are all the latest brain people who are able or brave enough to think outside the box.<br /><br />There are two more eye opening books like Stroke of Insight that can help introduce the reader to these ideas. Iain McGilchrist's masterpiece, The Master and his Emissary goes into this theme in more detail; however, being British and having a job to keep, he doesn't allow himself to let rip with the obvious truth, like the American Jill Bolte Taylor does. Tony Wright has written a brilliant short introduction to the brain hardware called Left in the Dark.<br /><br />If you read these books, then you are probably on the path to the truth, just like those Victorians were when they sat down with Darwins Origin of the Species.<br /><br />These are very exciting times indeed!e enough to think outside the box.<br /><br />There are two more eye opening books like Stroke of Insight that can help introduce the reader to these ideas.

0307592731|5.0|I felt as though I took this journey with Cheryl Strayed. I felt her exhaustion, pain, and exhilaration all the way through. I'm not a hiker--I'm not even a nature lover. In fact, one way for a writer to put me to sleep is to rhapsodize over the beauty of a scene in nature. There is some description of this type in Strayed's story but no more than necessary.<br /><br />I have read stories about hikers before, and the authors who peak my interest are the ones who describe their physical and emotional struggles--their war against the elements so to speak. Let the trees and flowers be and tell me what you're feeling--tell me about those mutilated toes with the blackened toenails or the aching back with the monstrous backpack. Tell me about the creatures, both beasts and humans, who threaten your existence on the trail. Tell me about your all-consuming hunger and thirst and, yes, you can even tell this Medicare recipient about your sexual yearnings. I'm up to all of it. Tell me about handling your bodily functions. I'm not the squeamish type. I want to know about how you handled yourself in every way, especially as a woman on the trail. I want to know how your journey changed you, how it healed you. If it helped you to finish grieving the end of relationships and/or the death of a parent, I want to hear all about it. And, Cheryl Strayed, you did it--you told me everything I wanted to know and in the most beautiful prose. It was sprinkled with some obscenities--but nothing horribly offensive. By the last few pages Strayed had me in tears--I was so moved.<br /><br />If you're a backpacker with a need for specific information about the Pacific Crest Trail, I'm sure that there are many other books more appropriate for you. But if you enjoy human stories which make you feel as though your feet are the ones walking the trail, give Wild a try.

B004TI5N38|3.0|I really believe David Baldacci to be one of the great fiction writers around today.  He has achieved great success in his field, obviously because of his talent and dedication to his craft.  Therefore, I feel a sense of embarrasment that he would stoop to creating a character who is so much like Lee Child's hero that the reader needs to search for dissimilarities rather than similiarities. Jack Reacher is,indeed, my very favorite fictional character and Puller is merely a very pale carbon copy.<br /><br />Having said all that, I want to review the book itself.  It starts out well but somehow gets bogged down along the way.  I was bored with all the detail about iranium and plutonium.  That was information that I neither want or need to know. The climax came as a real surprise, and not a good one,at that  Without meaning to be a spoiler, I feel that what happened there was only to permit Puller to ride into the sunset unemcumbered. It also seems to me that this author leans a little too far to the left for my taste.  There are some not so subtle remarks that are not necessary to the story line. I do not think I care to read anymore John Puller books.

B005S9EJ14|4.0|Exotic locations and old-fashioned storytelling conventions are nothing revolutionary at the movies, but when executed with professionalism and an abundant heart, it can make for charming entertainment. This is exactly what happens under the reins of director John Madden ([[ASIN:B00001U0E1 Shakespeare in Love]]) with this whimsical 2012 dramedy that brings together a sterling cast of accomplished British veterans to play seniors who choose to \\"outsource\\" their retirement in India's colorfully mythical Rajasthan region. What they discover upon their arrival is a decrepit hotel run by an irrepressible young owner appropriately named Sonny. Optimistic to a buoyant extreme, he tries to gloss over the hotel's numerous shortcomings with a mix of responses from his rather addled guests, and their individual transitions into the local culture is what makes up their narrative adapted by screenwriter Ol Parker from Deborah Moggach's 2004 novel, [[ASIN:0812982428 These Foolish Things]].<br /><br />The group of seven strangers who turn up on the steps of the Marigold Hotel is led by Evelyn, a recent widow who finds she has been saddled with her husband's seemingly insurmountable debts. Through her blog, she provides the film's central voice as she identifies her tentative steps toward not only assimilation into the Indian way of life but her own personal emancipation. Graham is a high-court judge who chooses early retirement in order to find the love of his youthful ardor when he lived in Jaipur as a boy. There's Muriel, an irascible spinster who is looking for a cheap hip replacement and plans to go back to England given her acute xenophobia. An unhappily married couple, Douglas and Jean, have come to the Marigold because they can't otherwise afford a retirement residence that meets her material needs. And then there are two singles both looking for mates in a new locale - saucy Madge who pretends to be Princess Margaret to gain entry into an exclusive club and incorrigible Norman who catches the eye of a lonely widow.<br /><br />Sonny has his own issues as he faces stern maternal protest to his efforts to save the family hotel and marry the fetching girl he loves, an employee at a local call center. Needless to say, each character figures out what to do to work through their challenges as their lives change in the process. The cast is unsurprisingly excellent even though some of the characters are rather sketchily developed. Judi Dench lends her particular gravitas to Evelyn as she evolves from fearful to empowered due to her fulfilling job as a cultural instructor at the call center. Tom Wilkinson makes Graham's journey to India a genuinely poignant one with an unexpected denouement. Maggie Smith steals scenes easily as Muriel, although I have to admit I found her changed attitude the most incredulous to accept. Bill Nighy plays put-upon Douglas with charming vulnerability, while Penelope Wilton has the unenviable task of playing the shrewish, frightened Jean with conviction.<br /><br />In roles originally slated for Julie Christie and Peter O'Toole (...how lovely it would have been to see such cinema icons in this film), Celia Imrie and Ronald Pickup provide a nice blend of impudence and optimism to Madge and Norman. Bringing youthful vigor to their lives is Dev Patel in his first major role since [[ASIN:B001UEBHYS Slumdog Millionaire]], and he brings a welcome comic ebullience to the proceedings as Sonny. Despite the creakiness of some of the plot devices, Madden keeps the pacing nimble enough so that no one character's arc dominates the tone of the film, which is crucial in reinforcing the message of hope he and Parker are conveying within the context of retirement and old age, that indeed life can get better with the proper attitude. Particular kudos need to be given to cinematographer Ben Davis ([[ASIN:B006INDMEE The Debt]]) who captures the teeming life and colorful splendor of Jaipur and Udaipur. This is not a film for the Avengers fanboys, but clearly the appeal of the distinguished cast and exotic locales has a clear target audience.ers fanboys, but clearly the appeal of the distinguished cast and exotic locales has a clear target audience.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I got this a while back on Amazon and just got around to viewing it.  I got it because I loved Band of Brothers and expected this would be just as good.  It didn't disappoint.  The production values are amazing, the actors are great and the suffering of war is tangible.<br /><br />There are scenes that remind me of Band of Brothers, even some of the dialogue is the same, and I actually liked the familiarity.  I appreciated the fear and the suffering and the savagery of war.  Spielberg and Hanks are very good at picking writers and directors and the ones on The Pacific really come through with a fine story.<br /><br />There is some political correctness which some viewers might not appreciate.  The Japanese are not seen that often, but there is one scene where a Marine medal of honor winner praises them as determined warriors, etc.  In truth, they were not.  One only needs to watch a documentary on the Bataan Death March to know what kind of warriors they were, not to mention the cowardly sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.  But that stuff aside, it really is a good miniseries.<br /><br />Compared to Band of Brothers, it doesn't hold up as well.  Band of Brothers takes the viewer from training to D-Day to the German surrender (amazing scenes there) and on to VE-Day, and what happens to everybody afterwards.  The Pacific doesn't do that.  So that was the only thing that disappointed me.  I was hoping for the same kind of set-up.<br /><br />I did learn a tremendous amount about what the war was like in the Pacific, thanks to the Spielberg/Hanks meticulous attention to detail.<br /><br />One other important point:  You have a choice on viewing options.  You can choose to play each episode with \\"historical background.\\"  Choose that option.  You will be glad you did because before the segment starts, you will hear from actual Marines who were there, just like in Band of Brothers where you heard from Dick Winters and the others.  This is the best part of the series.  Hearing directly from the actual Marines is humbling and enlightening.  It makes you grateful to the men and women who made it possible to continue the way of life we all enjoy.<br /><br />One other thing, on disc 6 there are interviews some of the Marines depicted in the episodes.  Wow, what a wonderful collection of interviews with these men, and in the case of the men who'd already died, their families.  This is well-worth the price of the set.  I highly recommend this.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is another great series from Spielberg/Hanks.

0375507256|5.0|The instant I finished reading Cloud Atlas, I realized that this was a book I could immediately start back over with no regrets, just so I could savor it all over again. And while I'm not doing that (immediately, that is - a re-read is definitely happening within the next two weeks), the fact that the book is so rich and rewarding that it could be read again is testament enough to how much I loved it. I want to be careful about how much I say about this so as not to rob you of the fun of discovering how complex and tightly structured it really is, but I'll tell you this: Cloud Atlas is made up of a series of novellas, each written in an entirely different voice, style, and even time period. There's an 18th century epistolary novel, a modern crime mystery, a post World War I tale of a dissolute music composer, and even some science-fiction thrown into the mix. Over the course of these stories, Mitchell showcases an incredible literary talent of mimicry and creation, creating books that feel less like an author paying homage to the past and more like long-lost discovered texts. And on its own, that would be enough to make Cloud Atlas a great read. But what's more fascinating is the way that Mitchell gradually reveals connections between the stories, connections that are both literal and thematic. By the time the book hits its beautifully written final lines, you realize how elegantly Mitchell has set up themes that echo across the tales and across the centuries, creating a book that's far more than the sum of its parts. In short, Mitchell has created an absolute masterpiece - a literary work that's incredibly accessible and entertaining, a writer's showcase that's also clever and fun, and a deeply moving statement about humanity and our tendencies and weaknesses.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Perfect in every way.  Perfect vocals, creative arrangements, intelligent music that's fun at the same time.  As of the moment I played this CD, I declared my hatred of pop music over.  Between Adele and now this, I'm encouraged.  Oh, and thoroughly entertained!
B0079R8KO0|1.0|Other reviews mentioned the wrinkled plastic cover but I was an optimist...  Mine came with a wrinkled cover.  I tried to look past it but I just can't.  If the cover was taught (like the pictures on Amazon's and Marware's web sites) I would have liked it.  The interior material is fine and the material on the back is fine too.  The fake leather on the front looks pretty fake.  For the price, fake leather is fine.  But I just can't use something with such poor quality, even if someone gave it to me for free.  I'm sending it back.<br /><br />The overall design is good.  The clip attachment is nice.  I very much dislike full enclosure (i.e., sliding in a frame) or the bungy-cord type holders.  If Marware can improve the quality, it would be a nice product.

0345803485|1.0|As an avid reader  I was interested when CBS reviewed Fifty  Shades of gray. I obviously did not order the correct title for my Kindle. I got the Kindle review of Fifty Shades of Grey and read the full review. The story was about a young girl recently graduated from college and learning about the world. Sounding like a sweet innocent read I ordered the book. Reading more, the book took a turn into a dark world of what I would call sexual abuse and unnatural sex acts. Interested in the relationship developing between the main chacters, I sped through the sexual pages and read the relationship ones,when suddenly almost mid sentence, the book ended. I was offered the opportunity of finishing the 3 books in the trilogy.<br /><br />My complaint is that the  review given did not indicate the true tone of the book. The sexual portions of this book were so graphic and abnormal that I don't want to read them in order to learn how these 2 peoples relationship develops. And while I could  fast forward through them, I don't want to spend $30 for something I didn't order in the first place, pornograhpy.
B007Q2N0HA|1.0|This book was recommended by Amazon, because I read 50 Shades of Grey.  That being said, I was less than impressed with this book.  Besides typos and possibly missing pages (allusions to key conversations that never happened!), the relationships were sketchy-- at best. The female lead gets banged into submission constantly. Quite possibly, the problem with this book is that it brings up some very serious issues, but doesn't do anything with these issues. Every time they come close to talking about Gideon, he starts seducing her or one of them takes off. Maybe the author digs more into these issues in a different book, but I don't plan on reading it to find out.  50 Shades of Grey was sexy-- this just felt cheap.

B0001US8EO|5.0|I used to love western movies in my earlier days, and they were so much more abundant. I guess they must have been the action movies of old times. In any case, I picked up a \\"Wyatt Earp\\" DVD from a Ross bargain rack and watched it last night. The movie was exceptionally well done but I wouldn't exactly think of it as an action movie. In fact, it seemed extremely long and drawn out with a fairly slow pace. Interesting and well done as it was, I began to fatigue a bit. Then the movie stopped and a little note appeared to go to Disc 2. Groan. What can I say? This is an interesting movie, without question, but it just exceeds my ability to concentrate, especially late at night when I'm watching it.<br /><br />The movie is centered about the legendary Sheriff Wyatt Earp, together with Batt Masterson and Doc Holiday, and the exploits in Dodge City Kansas and Tombstone, Arizona. I expect that the depictions are much more realistic than most of the westerns I've watched, but I really have no way of knowing. The acting was quite good but seemed a bit stiff and formalized as in a lot of British depictions of more ancient times. There was a certain amount of blood and gore, but it was done in good taste, if that designation might be applied, and fit the context of a western movie. There was a certain amount of foul language, but it was fitting and appropriate to the scene, not like an overwhelming amount of F-speak found in a lot of modern movies. The sets, scenery and filming of such was excellent. The sound was quite good, much better than most modern surround-sound movies. The movie was an extremely interesting historical depiction. All in all, it was a very worth-while movie but if you attempt to watch it, leave a lot of time. I'm thinking of it as a 4 1/2-star movie, becaus of the excessive length, but I can easily upgrade it to a five.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B005LAIHIQ|1.0|If you've seen the coming attractions for this 2012 film, you've seen ALL the funny (or vaguely funny) scenes in the film. There is nothing else except the interminable wait for something else to amuse, shock, or otherwise lift your spirits.<br /><br />Unless you are very hard core Tim Burton or Johnny Depp fans, there is really nothing here for you. Even fans of the TV show will be disappointed.<br /><br />While this certainly isn't the worst film ever made, when you look at the talent involved and the miserable product they give us, it's a real shame to see resources wasted in this manner.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|I finished this book two days ago and it's taken me a couple of days to sort out in my mind the things that really bothered me about this book.  Let's start out with the good.  The writing and editing is good.  The story kept me moving forward even when I wanted to throw it across the room.  I really wanted to understand the characters and wanted them to change and I think that's what kept me moving through the book.  Now for the bad.<br /><br />I tried to tell myself that relationships and young love are filled with high drama, craziness and misunderstandings.  And that's okay, that's what young love is all about.  What is not okay (not okay at all) is how this book glorifies an abusive relationship.<br /><br />If your partner is controlling who you are allowed to see, if he/she flies off the handle with rage to the point where they are beating up people on a regular basis, if he/she uses sex with others and/or alcohol to cope like the male character does, that is not a healthy normal relationship, it's abuse.  It's not passionate or charming or dramatic love, it's scary and threatening.<br /><br />I would love it if all these folks giving this book a 5 star rating sat down with an abused woman and asked her \\"Looking back, what were the signs of abuse?\\" chances are she would describe many behaviors the male character in this book displays.  It's not okay at all that the author glorifies and romanticizes abuse.  Especially when young girls (ages 13-25) are often the victims of partner abuse but haven't been educated as to what the signs of abuse are.  Not cool at all.  It's not cool when a sparkly vampire stares at you when you sleep (hello?  creepy stalker!) and it's not cool to beat people up  and manipulate the person you confess to love.<br /><br />Honestly the main male character is not the charming bad boy the author wanted him to be.  He comes across as a massive controlling jerk, and a violent abuser.  If this guy was around in real life, he wouldn't be the\\"stud\\" of the campus, he would be in jail facing assault charges.<br /><br />I think the author was trying to show how these two very flawed characters are a disaster on their own but good together. By the time the main male character finally confessed how he felt to  the female lead, I prepared for him to get his stuff together and be the man he could be.  This would have been a great place in the writing to insert the very tragic event that happens towards the end and really make the story about how these two disasters of people are able to come together and grow stronger in the face of a true disaster.  Instead I got about 100 more pages of jealousy, violence, misunderstandings, and abuse before the tragic event that brings the characters back together.<br /><br />Yeah, about that tragic event.  Really?  Are you kidding me?  You write a scene describing a horrific event and the loss of the lives of people the characters probably knew (after all the author explained it's a small school with a big rumor mill) and the characters are unaffected?  They run off and live happily ever after with a couple hours of sadness thrown in for effect?  That's it?  I didn't think the characters were so ultimately heartless but I guess they are.  That aspect of the ending moved this book into the realm of worst ending ever for me.<br /><br />I guess my ultimate hope is that folks read this book not as a grand love affair between two flawed characters, but as a book about an abuser and the girl he falls for and her inability to see her role in the relationship as a codependent enabler.<br /><br />I gave out one star for the writers ability to put together a story (no matter how flawed it was) and one star for editing (which wasn't the best nor the worst edited that I've read).

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this whole series. I only started the first book because I noticed that a few facebook friends were discussing their love of this series but they didn't mention what genre it was. As I was having a hard time finding something that would hold my attention I got a sample of the first book and then could not put it down. I read all three books within 3 days and I already miss the characters. I have not read any type of romance books since my 20's and found this one to be intriguing. I normally read mystery, thriller or sci-fi. I found not only a love story and a mystery but a story so well written that I fell in love with the characters. The only other books I have read that I felt so strongly about were \\"The Stand\\" by Stephen King and the series \\"Sweet Savage Love\\" by Rosemary Rogers both of which I read in my 20's nearly 25 years ago.<br />I have read some of the  controversy about these books and I totally disagree with all of it. IF you are not prudish about sexual content you will love these books. I am recommending them to everyone I know including my husband!<br />Since the movie is in the casting phase, I find myself constantly checking to hear the latest news about it. E.L. James needs to write more on these characters!!!!
B007Q2N0HA|1.0|Was I ever disappointed with Bared to You!  This is one of the poorest written books that I have read in several years.  We are asked to suspend reality with this couple as they have meaningless sex on every page!  Get real, they couldn't walk if they had that much sex in a day.  There is no plot, no dialogue worth mentioning, the story does not move, and the main characters are wooden.  This is a waste of time and money, and rip off of Fifty Shades of Grey, right down to the unbelievable apartment, the complete knowledge of everything being known by the \\"hero\\", and the tragic events that hold both main characters in their \\"reach\\" to love and become normal.  What drivel.

I applaud Jacee for being able to talk about her captivity and write a book about it.  I am forever changed by reading it.  Everyone should read this book, it was hard to put down.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|You WILL NOT REGRET buying these books, no matter what your age.<br />Suzanne Collins masterfully put these books together, & deserves her accolades.<br />I'm a 32-yr. old female, & at 1st I WAS hesitant about purchasing books intended for \\"young adults\\" (I'm not sure what the age spectrum on a \\"young adult\\" book is), but I finally gave in, & bought them one-by-one (via Whispernet for the Kindle)...& now that I'm finished (just finished today), I can't stop thinking about the storyline.<br />I haven't shed a tear in over two years, & at two points in the 2nd book, & @ the end of the 3rd, I actually teared up! That's how powerful these books are. Sure, there's a decent amount of teen angst stuff that could have been cut out, but it's still an amazing piece of work. Guys, I NEVER CRY! Or tear up! But somehow, this series managed to touch me THAT deeply.<br /><br />The last series that I had been reading prior to \\"The Hunger Games\\", were Charline Harris's \\"Sookie Stackhouse\\" books, which in my opinion, aren't very good. I only read them becuz I love True Blood (& Alexander Skarsgård).<br />Before that, I read George R. R. Martin's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series. To be fair to Charline Harris, it's quite hard to top his amazing writing abilities & the multi-character perspectives in which you're treated to (altho a god/goddess only knows WHEN he'll finish the last two books).<br />& before that...ummm, it was probably Stephen King's \\"Dark Tower\\" series, & prior to that...Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" series....& of course I read J. R. R. Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series (I REALLY like series lol)...sigh, I could go on & on, but it's pointless. I just wanted anyone reading this to know that I am very well read when it comes to fiction, that I'm 32, female, & I LOVED THESE BOOKS!!!!!!!<br />Bottom line, get them!

0393324818|4.0|I am not much of a sports person, and even less of a baseball person. I wanted to read this book before I watched the Brad Pitt film adaptation, which has been taking up space on my DVR for a while now. I was surprised by how much I liked this book. It's clever and funny, and while I learned a lot more about baseball than I knew before, this isn't just a book about baseball. It's about money, logistics, and heart. I think anyone even remotely interested in the story of the Oakland A's will enjoy this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|the audio makes for a great night read and the voice is soothing! definitely great that this is a free app too!
B003Y5H5AG|3.0|I finally caught \\"The Smurfs\\" on cable. A big fan of the original cartoon from my childhood, I was not pleased with the trailers I saw for the CGI version and assumed this movie would be smurftacularly awful. Well, I was wrong. Amazingly, it's not half bad. I think most of the credit belongs to Neil Patrick Harris and Hank Azaria, who are very amusing to watch. The CGI Smurfs are just okay. They are probably the weakest part of the whole movie, which is unfortunate, but they aren't nearly as bad as the likes of CGI Scooby-Doo. Parents should be able to tolerate watching this with their children.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like it. it has good and fun games to kill time. my kids and hubby likes playing them as well.
0374275637|5.0|Like the title of the review says, I wish that I had read this book earlier in my life.  However, I'm sure that there was a time in my life when I would have rejected this book out of hand as either not applying to me or as being boring.<br /><br />Only read this book if you are willing to consider what it says with an open mind.  This book just might change how you think or how you see things.  There is little chance that this book (or any other) will change how you behave, mostly because of all of your innate biases as revealed in this book.  The author himself admits to discovering something surprising but finding himself behaving in the same exact way as before.<br /><br />At the very least, you will learn something from this book and you'll have fun while doing so.
1451673442|4.0|The best part about the book is that it provides many exercises. There are a total of 28 exercises you can do that are incuded in the book. It teaches you about the Law of Attraction. You may also go to the author's youtube channel and get everything you need to know. Where she also is grateful for the things that she has in her life. The Magic will do amazing things for your life as well as the same way it did for the authors. I also would like to highly recommend another amazing read [[ASIN:1477461248 The Door is Open]]

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book makes me sorry for all of the gifted writers out there who don't get an iota of the publicity and hype this trilogy received.  I don't think E.L.James can be faulted for writing, publishing and profiting from these works.  That being said, I do think that she has committed a cardinal sin:  writing erotica that is boring!

B004EPYZSK|3.0|What do you get when you have both Indiana Jones and James Bond fighting nasty space aliens? Surprisingly, not much. It's a lukewarm effort, COWBOYS & ALIENS, a sci-fi horse opera that kicks its intriguing premise to the curb. Jon Favreau, dude... &iquest;Que paso hombre?<br /><br />Is it that too many cooks are in this kitchen? The script, treated like a frisbee, was tossed around amongst Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby, and there's always worry when you have that many script wranglers in the mix. It surely did not help that the eventually better-reviewed (yet lesser budgeted) ATTACK THE BLOCK debuted at the box office on the same day, never mind that COWBOYS & ALIENS, going into it, had garnered more fanfare.<br /><br />Props to Daniel Craig for a really good performance, and with a bang-on American accent, to boot. He brings to the table his patented coiled physicality and a certain quiet swagger that lends itself well to the oater genre. And, as usual, he's not exactly a fount of blabbety-blab. Dude is stoic. He plays a scruffed-up stranger who gallops into the dusty desert town of Absolution, New Mexico. The man has no memory of his past and he's got this odd metal shackle circling his wrist. From his waking up in the desert to the run-in with some rough hooligans to his arrival in Absolution, it's all good. Those scenes had me anticipating a good time at the movies.<br /><br />And then the other cast members shuffle in, and the central casting department must be empty as heck, because all the stock characters have surfaced onscreen here. There's the gun-toting preacher (Clancy Brown) and the sort of wimpy doctor (Sam Rockwell) whose wife insists that he has nothing to prove (meaning that he does) and the little boy who you keep expecting, at any moment, to yell out \\"Shane! Come back!\\" Olivia Wilde brings the sexy but elicits endless bemused expressions from me, and, worse, she doesn't even get buck nekkid as may have been hinted in certain promos. She plays a mysterious gal named Ella who claims to know something about the brusque stranger with the lunky metal bracelet. She strolls with a gun belt on, so we realize that she's far from a damsel in distress. Until later on, when she becomes a damsel in distress. There's a reveal about her which, again, bemused expression.<br /><br />There's half a mo when I thought Harrison Ford's character, awesomely, would be a straight-out villain. That would've been an interesting twist for Ford. But, it turns out, his despotic Colonel Dolarhyde is merely misunderstood, that it only required a scared little boy to soften him up. I really expected something grander from this big name ensemble, instead of this pedestrian outcome.<br /><br />The grizzled town sheriff (Keith Carradine) learns that it takes more than a mere \\"Reach for the sky, mister!\\" to cow the stranger who had just braced and bruised the bullying son of the town's principal benefactor, who happens to be influential cattle baron, Colonel Dolarhyde. And since the Colonel's son had just shot up a sheriff's deputy, he also sees the guts of a jail cell. But, look, here comes the ruthless Colonel Dolarhyde, bent on springing his wastrel offspring. So far, the plot is unfolding in generic western form.<br /><br />But before things could go full-on RIO BRAVO, alien vessels streak out of the sky and begin raining destruction onto Absolution, a town that just got even more dusty. Grappling harnessy hook-thingees project out of these vessels and ensnare random townspeople, and this may be when the film achieves its most electrifying moment, as these caught victims rapidly dwindle into these tiny dots in the sky, all flown away. This is around when the stranger realizes what his wrist shackle is truly capable of. I wish then that the film had focused more on the reactions of loss from those left behind. \\"Doc\\" is the most visibly affected, his wife one of those abducted. The rest seem all gung-ho to form a rescue posse, bypassing any modicum of devastated grief. I understand that you have to keep things moving, but the result is that I wasn't as invested in these characters. Because if they don't give a what, then why should I?<br /><br />COWBOYS & ALIENS does have some spiffy action sequences, the highlight of which is the big showdown between the search party - composed of cowboys, Apaches, and badmen - and the savage aliens. But clogging up chunks of the narrative are these long-winded, lethargic moments. I just can't get past the clunkiness. Not to mention, the big bad aliens themselves may look good but their motivation is strictly by-the-numbers stuff. Not counting Daniel Craig, the performances of the cast members (even Harrison Ford) come off as rote. The western stereotypes pile up, and not even the sci-fi injection can ultimately bump it up. So, I say, check this out when it's on cable because what Daniel Craig does here is worth watching. But what I really recommend is the graphic novel this film was based on. And, also, ATTACK THE BLOCK, if you're hankering for a more spirited and creative sci-fi thriller.ho to form a rescue posse, bypassing any modicum of devastated grief.

0670023329|5.0|This is an incredible story of evil among us right now today. It is a horrifying story of evil in North Korea. A young man born into a forced labor camp who knows nothing but what is in front of him. Rarely permitted to see his parents. They are all starved and worked to death and the only hope of more food is to become a rat and tell on those around you who are complaining or planning anything against the government. He tells the authorities of his Mother and brothers plan to try and escape and receives more rice; but he also is required to see his Mother and brother executed before his eyes for their plans. It is one incredible, moving and terrifying story of how one government on earth treats those they deem not worthy participants in a normal way of life. That is about all that needs said and you should read this book so you can thank God everyday for the country we live in with all its faults. What I have shared is a pittance to the horror this young man went through in his story which has been validated. You'll also learn of the incredible kindness the South Korean government has shown in the way of helping programs to give these people a better life. Incredible story like a holocaust today. And to think these leaders of North Korea have nuclear weapons is downright frightening.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was unable to stop reading once I picked up the first book.  I read the entire trilogy in 5 days and I work full time.  Every minute I had I was reading.  The story line kept me in suspense.  It was not predictable at all.  Do not purchase just one book - purchase the trilogy.  You will not want to wait to read what is going to happen in two and three.

B00402FGE4|4.0|Another wonderful show killed by greed. People aren't watching much TV anymore because of the greed of TV executives. WAY TOO MANY COMMERCIALS. When you take a show no matter how wonderful it is and load it up with tones of commercials, there's no point in watching. People watch TV so they can loose themselves in a wonderful story but if it is interrupted every few minutes by commercials you CAN'T get involved in the story. This was one of the few really good TV shows to come along in a long time. Greed kills good programing. I don't bother to watch TV anymore because of just this problem. I wait till it comes to Netflix. I don't even own a TV now. What's the point. TV SUCKS!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I never review books, but am coming out of the closet to hopefully save someone from the hype.<br /><br />Save your hard earned dollars, folks - I can't believe this is the no. 1 book on Amazon right now.  It is positively the worst thing I have ever read, and I am not a book snob.  It's not so much the content (although that sucks too) but the writing style and the over use of phrases such as \\"oh my\\" \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"my sex\\" that makes my stomach turn.  Don't buy this.  Just don't.  Your life will be better for not reading it.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why is this book a bestseller? This book has a writing style that is painful and repetitive. The sex scenes aren't that exciting. I found their flirting, bickering, arguing, mood swings, and sexy talk nauseating. Someone enlighten me, how has this book exploded? I was going to give it two stars, because I did in fact finish the book. But I decided to drop it down to one star when I remembered I paid ten dollars for this piece of garbage.

B005LAIGPU|5.0|I'm not going to bother with a synopsis and conventional review. That is covered in detail by others.<br /><br />I'm just going take a moment to debate the argument of those who criticize this movie.<br /><br />Firstly, this movie is being mistaken for a superhero flick, which in fact it definitely isn't. It's annoying to see people (who are fixated with the standard comic book template) telling me how much more fun x-men is.<br /><br />No this is not the rise and fall of heroes or villains, rather a much more complex story that is probably more like the adult interpretations we find in Japanese mangas like 'akira'.<br /><br />It's the rise and fall of friendship, a group of kids who are bestowed tremendous power without limits. It triggers the imagination in a completely Different way. Nobody puts on a cape here. What would you do? And as it progresses it reveals the very realistic conclusion. An inner struggle to contain what is spinning out of control. The frustration of his cousin to contain the 'big secret' and the demise of our main character as he begins to take on a superiority complex.<br /><br />It unravels in a very realistic and thought provoking way. And the 'found footage' perspective helps to distinguish this from marvel comics etc. Overall I found this incredibly refreshing.

I got stuck towards the end, but luckily there is a hint system built in the options menu. It's easy to control and manipulate things and the graphics are gorgeous.
030788743X|5.0|Seriously people. This is a really good book.<br /><br />I am not a book reader by any means. I am however and avid gamer and a lover all things nerdy which only helped me relate to this book even more. Ernest Cline creates a book that paints a movie in your mind that you want to watch over and over agian. I had a hard time putting this book down once I started and I am already tempted to pick it back up to make sure I did not miss a single event of this epic tale.<br /><br />For his first novel I am very impressed. I can not wait for his next work. If you want a amazing tale that will keep you waiting to see what happens next after every word get this book today!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great story. Got a lot of hype for being a \\"dirty\\" book. It's a great read and love story with  erotic scenes.  \\"Dirty\\" if you're a prude.  Loved it,  loved it.  I couldn't put it down.  I immediately downloaded the second book.  And the third!
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I like this app if you don't have wifi 24/7 it doesn't stay accurate. You have to go to a place that does have wifi to update the app every 24 to 48 hrs. So I actually was going to rate this 3 1/2 stars, four stars had to do. So if you have internet access this app is great for you, but if don't have time to update the weather than I would rethink buying this app.<br />The plus side to this app it shows great weather graphics, with hour time clock.
B0026IUXO2|4.0|We watched this movie last night on an impulse and because Cate Blanchett had the title role. Neither of us knew anything about the movie nor had we read any reviews so we had no warning or preparation for what we were about to see. My biggest impression out of this movie was a sincere feeling of gratitude that I was born in the United States.<br /><br />The movie is interesting but also depressing; there is very good acting but miserable, distorted lives are being portrayed. One is left with a slightly dirty feeling and recognition that things are really not so bad in the good ole USA. One begins to wonder if the inbreeding of the nobility hadn't already begun to cause serious problems in the gene pool. There were really no sympathetic characters with whom we could relate at any level. Whereas the movie was instructional it was not entertaining.<br /><br />Although we appreciated the quality of the acting, it won numerous Academy Awards; the story was depressing and dark. It is not a family film and this is one I suggest you view before you buy. We will probably never watch it again.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|everything was fine with my purchase.[[ASIN:B0007KTBIU Pocahontas (Two-Disc 10th Anniversary Edition)]]<br />thank you for all you have done!this just so happens to be my daughters very favorite movie! so pleased to have the dvd.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I LOVE IT. Everyday my kindle comes on and reminds me to read the word. Each scripture fits my day. This is truly a perfect prophetical product.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book?<br /><br />Well, for the first time ever, I bought a book solely on it's hype and without reading a single review. I'm ashamed. I can only hope no one else makes the same mistake. It makes me sad to think so many wonderful authors are never recognized for their work, yet this book (which I consider the herpes of the writing world) leaves it's disfiguring mark on so many minds.<br /><br />I can only assume the character of Christian is based on Bret Easton Ellis' Patrick Bateman, although I'm told the story is inspired by Twilight. Ugh. He is nothing more than a good-looking sociopath. No dimension whatsoever. I don't find anything remotely intriguing or attractive about this man.<br /><br />I'm not sure who Ana is based on, other than a generic, naive moron. A virginal girl with no previous sexual experience who quickly accepts a BDSM lifestyle as easily as an order of fries with a Big Mac.<br /><br />The characters are dry and unbelievable, the writing is juvenile, and the sex is as hot as a box of rocks. One more mention of sensations \\"down there\\" from Ana or her inner goddess and I will surely vomit. I'm turning Fifty Shades of Green just thinking about how much money this woman made.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i read all three hunger games books - and all of them were great. But the first one is the best as allways :)
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I loved the flow of the text and the upper class New York experience you get when you read \\"Bared to you\\", While its sinfully descriptive, I feel it doesn't take away from the story and the emotions of Eva and Gideon, if their love making doesn't have a significance in the way the characters interact or change toward each other it's not described, and I appreciated that. I cant wait for the next installment of the series, They're two damaged people just trying to find a place in each others world ::sigh:: I love a hopeless romance and \\"Bared to You\\" was a \\"don't bother me, I'm reading!\\" kind of story :)

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I totally love this game. Except for the point that u have to buy games with coins u earn. I mean I'm keel with that but its super expencive. At least its not real money. You play games to earn coins. You use the coins to buy more games. Its super fun. And there's a goal u have to get to. I really like this game
B00785P2QC|5.0|great fun very additive. I would reccomend this game to anyone that wants to have fun.the onlyvbad part is I don't have enough time to play
B007SYWFRM|1.0|In app purchases are only supposed to be a welcome addition to an already solid game. Their decision to make the game &quot;free&quot; and monetize it everyway possible from the very beginning is misleading. Every parent would rather pay a couple bucks upfront than to end up paying several purchases throughout gameplay. I can't believe the people behind Ice Age would green light such a sketchy model. Formatting a game around a profit motive instead on playability cripples the enjoyment &amp; creativity. Who knows maybe the problems shutting down the game or closing the shop which many people report isn't a glitche at all... with this game's intent it's anyone's guess.
B000SJJCX4|4.0|This is not a gigging pedal. You do not have time to tune with this pedal at a gig, so if you're planning on gigging in the next month or so spend the $50 on a Korg. However if you're an at-home player who just wants to not have to mess around with regular electric tuners, this is worth the price. It sits right on the pedal board, the signal flies through it when it's off so there's no monkeying with your cables everytime you want to switch between standard and Drop D, and it's as accurate as the Korg is. It's just also slow. It takes a good 2-3 seconds to register a change, which is fine when you're just practicing or even for recording at home where a few seconds aren't crucial. I just recommend something a little faster if you need to tune quickly between songs.
B006LQQ1GE|2.0|I really enjoyed \\"Somebody that I used to know\\" and had high hopes for an eclectic indie rock album. Unfortunately, what I heard was a very confusing mix of genres that don't mesh.

B007HJ84ZK|1.0|Streamed video looks like a bootlegged copy.<br />I have enjoyed the book I really would like to watch this show, but do not want to spoil first experience by watching crappy pixelated low resolution copy of it.
0060873027|4.0|First the bad news: this story is, technically, utterly impossible. Yes, you read it here -- the band of protagonist scientists are acutally shrunk to a height of half an inch with some high-tech gizmo.<br /><br />Now the good news: if you can get past that, the story coheres rather well. It is very like a cross between Crichton's [[ASIN:B0002STNQ2 Prey]] and [[ASIN:0345370775 Jurassic Park]]. A band of scientists (life sciences: botany, entemology, etc) have to get out of an extremely hostile, surrealistic environment, as in Jurassic Park. At the same time, they have to battle killer micro-bots controlled by an evil monomaniac villain.<br /><br />This book is classic Crichton: crisp action and dialoge, very light-to-nonexistent in extraneous description and characterization. Crichton's signature layering of plot events and character motivations is, as usual, exquisite. A real page-turner full of twists and turns from beginning to end.<br /><br />But the reader must first get past that hurdle of the book's \\"Fantastic Voyage\\"-like premise.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I downloaded the sample first chapter out of curiosity about the fuss over this book. I was surprised to get hooked on it.  Yes the writing is silly and the book could have used a good editor to slash out all of the blushing, inner goddess stuff and the lip biting.  The book says Gray gets turned on by her lip biting but think about it if she's doing that she looks buck toothed all the time and how sexy is that? In spite of all the nonsense the author has written a fast paced book in which you like Anastasia and want to know what is going to happen next. Many a better written novel has missed one or both of those elements.  My advice, download the sample and check it out.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I was a bit skeptical about how great the sound quality coming from a headset could be, but after buying these, I am a true believer.  The sound is phenomenal and really immerses you in whatever game you're playing or movie you're watching.<br /><br />There are a few negative points.  They crackle and emit static on occasion, probably due to interference from other devices, the microwave for example really messes with them for some reason.  They also eat batteries for breakfast.  I anticipated this however and bought some rechargeable batteries and recommend the same to anyone looking to purchase any wireless headset.<br /><br />They are a bit on the expensive side, but being able to play games or watch movies with the volume as loud as I like, anytime I want and without disturbing my wife, make these bad boys worth every penny.
0385344228|5.0|Well-written, so very layered, nothing given away until the end. Incredible writing skill and a compelling story. I can't wait to read his other books - I'm so in awe of how well-composed this novel is.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|used it for quick note/reminder but regardless of pen size still awkward and clunky think it would be better served if the scripting was a little more precise and clear persons with larger fingers have problems trying to write with precision in a pinch it will do
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It was fantastic to have the option to have the trilogy to download instead of each book on its own. Plus the savings you offered were the greatest gift. I am glad to see that you now offer books in sets as well as singles.<br />The books themselves were fantastic. Total cliffhangers. I couldn't put them down. I had so much fun getting my friends and family involved by recommending the series to them. And then once the movie came out we all enjoyed comparing the differences. I hope anyone who takes the time to read these books enjoys them as much as we all have.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|This first part is amazing, it prepares perfectly for the second part and is a real journey with the characters. David Yates made a very good job at portraying the lonely, desperate journey of the three, keeping always the story interesting and flowing...
B007V2UGPE|5.0|)This game is like fruit ninja on steroids. One angry samurai versus the zombie apocolypse. Awesome graphics and excellent game play.
B000000W9Z|5.0|This is an absolute masterpiece. One of his very best and the one I love the most. It has a unique atmospere, very David Lynch, I would say...Well a song has actually been used in Lost Highways \\"Deranged\\". The piano work is incredible. One of the best albums I've ever listened to. All the joy I see through these architect's eyes.

B001UV4XIS|5.0|I'm really satisfied with this end of the saga. It has the right amount of action and it doesn't forget the most important thing: the characters. I like everything of this movie. A very good work has been done in ten years, and this saga is already \\"classic\\". Let's review the film here!
B003WMX3SY|5.0|Well I'm just an average geek and probably I built a couple of pc's and so far this one is one of my favorite case! You have plenty of space and the ventilation is awesome! I live is south Florida and I hate turn the AC on, so my PC need a really, really good ventilation. I love that they add to your purchase a couples of fans and that save you a couple of dollars! I used to hate the lights on pc but with the blue led light from the fans just made me buy some extras UV and white lights and that's make my PC look so AWESOME!<br /><br />This case worth every dollar so don't be afraid and invest in a really awesome case!
B000TETKA8|3.0|Ashes to ashes is one of the best songs I've ever heard, but I really can't stand the rest of the album and don't get the hype and love around it. Teenage wildwife, how can you like it? It changes continually, there are too many words, it seems it has no end...I've tried to like this album, but no, it is not for me.<br /><br />EDIT:<br /><br />I quite like it now...I still don't love it, but I've changed my mind. I still cannot stand Teenage Wildlife...too long, too exaggerated...it loses reality...it seems...theatrical...It wants too much to be...There is another couple of songs I don't like towards the end...But I now quite appreciate the \\"whole\\"...Ashes to ashes is one of the best things I've ever listened to.
030746363X|3.0|Excuse my review title.<br /><br />In short, everyone can get SOMETHING out of this book, whether its bodybuilding (Although he recommends 4 hours a week...complete BS unless you are a beginner. I already trained before the book for about a year and I know from testing different routines that you need at least 5 good days of exercise, and cardio almost everyday if you are an endomorph, which means you are prone to fat gain from carbs).<br /><br />Let me tell you that it was thoroughly entertaining, regardless of some of the absurd suggestions he gives you. He has done his homework, and I commend his first 100 page section on fat loss, although I should have read it backwards because I was on my gaining cycle and he tells you to eat almost 100% differently during a high caloric cycle.<br /><br />Here's what I love about the book. He talks to you intimately...although he seems to exclude phenotypes (Endomorph, Mesomorph, Ectomorph) as not being all that relevant, when let me tell you as an Endo with an Ectomorph roommate, it makes all the difference in the world. I see my roommate taking gainer shakes (600 cal, 80g Carbs, etc...) twice a day, eat mass amounts of carbs, mostly simple carbs, and not only not get fat but gains next to no muscle, and I eat a serving of ice cream as my weekly splurge and put on 3 or 4 pounds of bloating and temporary fat (I work it off), it makes ALL the difference.<br /><br />I do like the supplements he suggests, as they're all relatively cheap for the fat loss cycle, but when he gets to the muscle building cycle, he suggests some outrageous supplements, especially on a college budget. I've taken a bunch of said supplements, N.O.Explode, Lipo-6...and they're both not extremely expensive, but he named off half a dozen that he takes on muscle building cycles. Those 2 alone are $50+ and that's if you buy off amazon...In stores, they'd add up to at least $75-100 for a month's supply. I wanted to throw the book at this point, feeling cheatedby genetics and knowing I would be ripped if I was only THAT rich...<br /><br />Like I said, this book does offer something for everyone...I personally don't need a muscle building regimen...mine's not perfect, but I know that it works. Short of dangerous anabolics, there is little to no chance of losing fat while putting muscle on and little chance of not losing muscle while dropping fat.<br /><br />It's just how it goes for most body types without golden genetics. My 4 pack has gone to a 1 pack and now that I'm satisfied with my 10+ pounds of lean mass, I can drop back down to my normal weight.<br /><br />Read the book as if you want some good pointers. But it isn't cheap on your wallet in terms of supplementing and fat loss eating. He talks about a man spending 31 dollars on food a week and I was in shock at the calorie deficit. It seemed unhealthily low for a 220 pound man.<br /><br />Just a suggestion if you read this book, do a calorie calculator and listen to it depending on your weight and exercise level. Just because you're feeling full from mass amounts of fiber, you could still be dropping a lot of lean mass along with it. Don't go too far below your recommended calorie intake.<br /><br />I tell you this only because I love you.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Who were not introduced to the BDSM erotic genre through EL book, it's an appalling rank amateur attempt at trying to write it. I could not make past the third chapter to read indepth and skimmed through the remaining chapters.  Poorly conceived and written and an insult to authors who write it well. I hate I had to even give it a star. Was the editor sleep on the job?

0955153077|5.0|I have to say I was very reluctant to buy this book because of all the free tutorials you can already find online. If you are looking for step-by-step guides only, this book might disappoint you, and perhaps you should stick to the online tutorials only. This book is different, though. You will get advice not only on how to paint, but there is a lot of tips on actual design and composition which could be applied to analog painting as well. The book itself is of great quality; I also bought Digital Painting Techniques vol.3 and I'm planning on eventually buy more from 3dTotal; years ago I bought 3dTotal Textures to use with 3dSMax and they have never disappointed me.

0439023491|5.0|I took my 12 year old daughter to the movie (Hunger Games) and we greatly enjoyed it.  She can't get enough and has now read all three books, knows all the districts and what all 12 of them do.  Me, I was greatly entertained, the casting was the best and I can't wait for the next movie.  Now, I guess I should read the books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Overall its a great refreshing new concept for the usually boring mini game setup. There are a few control issues with some of the games where the screen sensitivity isn't lending itself to your best interests...sometimes the game didn't react to my movements until it was too late and I would die. However, I love the challenge of earning new games and the whole interface is very supportive and encouraging. For example,  you're awarded points for persistence even if you don't win the game. lol Very nice guys.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome you should so get it this is great new games with your points and it is just so awesome
B0068FZ0GK|5.0|What a classic!  It is a feel-good movie that I can watch with my grandchildren.  On vacation a few years ago, I visited the field--it was awesome to walk the bases!
B003UPPO2G|5.0|We first saw the \\"One Night Only\\" with the Bee Gees on Public TV a few years ago, LOVED the program and decided to order it up  from Amazon to share with our friends... and enjoy the show!!
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I read all three. Well, I skim read the second and third. These books started off promising in the first few chapters of the first book. But then, they got progressively less erotic, which is fine, but also progressively less character and story driven. Too much, ,I love you, I love you and notnenough content. Sappy and sentimental.<br /><br />The sex part: my guess is that these are either written by a man trying to appeal to the mommy market in soft core porn or by a woman not too knowledgeable about creativity and sex. Just my opinion.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|After hearing about this book for some time from friends, I finally picked it up. It delivered on everything that I heard about it. The story of the lost running tribe, Caballo Blanco and the evolution of hte Copper Canyon Ultramarathon left me wanting more. The story is inspirational and a great motivation to puruse your own running challenges.
B003PBB4ME|2.0|Yes. This \\"stabilizing handle\\" does not stabilize at all. It's made of plastic so it is very light and does not feel sturdy. I put a camera of medium weight on it and the shakiness of the image when I view it on the computer is the same as if I held it with my bare hands (okay, I'll be honest, AT MOST 10% shakiness reduction). The camera I used was a JVC Everio GZ-HD7 by the way.<br /><br />The thing is, when you hold this by the top (which is ideal) the whole thing swings like a pendulum when you move around with the weight of the camera on the bottom. This would not be a problem if the grip was heavier. I've discovered that taping a light dumbell to the bottom helps somewhat.<br /><br />The only thing you would buy this for is the extra mount (for microphones or lights) on top, the convenient helicopter-style bottom (if you don't want to get your camera dirty on the ground, but then again why the heck would you put an expensive camera on the ground), and simply a better grip on the camera (which does not guarantee at all that it will stabilize your image).<br /><br />Overall, if you want to get a good stabilizer at this price, you're better off getting a tripod and using that to double as a stabilizer. It works quite well.

B007Q476KU|3.0|I want to give this movie 2.5 stars but I will round up to three. It finished up ooookay but it opened with quite possibly the worst 20 minutes in cinematic history.<br /><br />This story about a boy and a horse opens with 20 minutes of extended celebrations of literally the smallest victories imaginable.<br /><br />Horse comes into the world.<br />Cut to extended shot of boy enthralled with horse's beauty, mouth agape and eyes wide.<br /><br />Horse stands up.<br />Cut to extended shot of boy enthralled with horse's beauty, mouth agape and eyes wide.<br /><br />Boy has an apple and the possibility exists that the horse MAY take a bite of the apple.<br />Cut to extended shot of boy enthralled with horse's beauty, mouth agape and eyes wide.<br /><br />You can do it, War Horse!<br /><br />But this is no one-trick pony. Bad things also happen to the horse.<br /><br />The horse might be sold.<br />Cut to extended shot of boy sniffling and blubbering, eyes watering up.<br /><br />The horse might be shot.<br />Cut to extended shot of boy sniffling and blubbering, eyes watering up.<br /><br />Ten minutes in we suspect it, but by the one hour mark, we are utterly convinced of the thesis Spielberg set out to prove with this film: This boy is gay for his horse.<br /><br />There are no two ways about it. Spielberg sets out, argues and concludes his case in one of the most convincing films of all time. This film leaves no doubt whatsoever in the viewer's mind that, this kid loves horses.  Big time.  You will walk away with the absolute knowledge that this kid loves horses.  Loves looking at them, loves crying about them, loves walking beside them, hugging them, feeding them fruit, thinking about them, dreaming about them, looking at pictures of them, putting collars on them, telling his friends about them, writing letters about them...<br /><br />War Horse.<br /><br />Also, the horse goes on some adventures, some more interesting than others.<br /><br />I recommend this if youhave a giant picture of a horse on your bedroom ceiling. Otherwise, you can probably take or leave it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|and the feelings and fears and denials of the parents.  Reminded me of the Jodi Picoult books in this respect.
0307277887|4.0|This one was en route to five stars until Lindsay got to the climactic character crisis and farted out an eye-rolling cliche-ridden \\"oh what do I do\\" back and forth that would have been better in a Tom and Jerry cartoon than as the key moment in an otherwise great book.<br /><br />Still, it wasn't enough to drag the whole project below four stars.  The central character is compelling, the pages turn quickly, the supporting characters are interesting.<br /><br />It makes the travesty that was Season 6 of the TV show all the more tragic.
B003SNJZ3Y|5.0|Mallaby does an amazing job of giving a detailed summary of the history of hedge funds over the past 50 or so years. His explanations of financial techniques and strategies are lucid and (I think) accessible to most non-professionals. I worked in investment banking during many of these episodes and his descriptions ring true. This is not often the case with financial journalists.<br /><br />He's able to make this potentially stultifying subject come alive through the use of telling anecdotes that reveal the fascinating characters involved, and by creating a series of narratives that demonstrate just how difficult it was for these players to adjust to volatile markets. His writing is a pleasure to read.<br /><br />My quibbles are that the book is perhaps a bit too exhaustive for the casual reader, and his conclusions a bit too sanguine. I agree with his overall thesis that hedge funds offer a good alternative to \\"too big to fail\\" financial institutions, and his innovative suggestion that they might play a larger, more important role in the future. However, there are real concerns about hedge funds' disruptive effects on the marketplace, as anyone whole lived through the Asian financial crisis or the 2008 meltdown can attest. A school of sharks can make an ecosystem stronger through winnowing out the weaker players, but they can cause a lot of pain and suffering along the way.
0812416643|5.0|This is pretty much the best bang for your buck you can get, in terms of wisdom per page.  It can't be more than 150 pages (something like 120, I think) and even a fool will find something that relates.  The story of Siddhartha is told from a Buddhist perspective but, whether you subscribe to those teachings or not, the story itself says a fair bit about life in general.<br /><br />If you read it and nothing in the book speaks to you, try it again in 10 years and get back to me.
0783225903|1.0|People kept recommending me this movie over and over and it sounded pretty interesting, think Monty Python meets 1984, now think about it again, wait that sounds pretty awful doesn't it? Well that's this movie in a nutshell, but lets go over why it sucked in detail shall we?<br /><br />-Stupid Love Plot: Terry Gilliam tries to ape George Orwell by throwing in a forbidden love story, but here the guy falls in love with a lesbian truck driver and their love and bonding are shown through 'zany' 'wacky' car chases through many expensive sets. Why does he love her again? Because she looks like someone in his dream; wow this is genius, someone pass me more crayons to chew on.<br /><br />-The Main Character: the main character is a bumbling pathological liar, feel sympathy for him yet? Don't worry you won't, he pretty much is a clumsy oaffish drone that decides to throw it all away to 'follow his heart', and this is basically the jist of the movie. He's getting into wacky chase scenes with the police that is supposed to be funny or informative or something? Really though it just felt like one big budgeted cartoon that took itself seriously, and you're supposed to relate to this clod.<br /><br />-Other characters: You see his mom a few times getting her face stretched, then you see her in a coffin later in the movie. Wow plastic surgery... BAD?? Wow Terry, that's deep man. You also see Robert Deniro who probably was drunk on the set show up as a 'vigalante air conditioner repair man'. You read that right. He shows up, beats up the two government repairmen, fixes the idio-I mean hero's air conditioner than zip-lines away. It's like Terry Gilliam got his son in kindergarten to write that part. Oh and near the end when the hero's dreaming of his escape Robert DeNiro's character comes to aid him but then gets smothered by pieces of paper floating around. *Cough* *Cough* Wow man this movie's like blowing my mind, beauracracy... BAD? That's like, too deep man, pass me the bong... Other characters show up I guess to spoon-feed the presumably stoned audience the same boring message over and over: beauracracy bad. We get it Terry, thank you, you can show us something new now, yes thanks Terry, we... get it! Moving on now, yes?<br /><br />-The Stage Designs: The designs are admittably impressive, however with all of Gilliam's works they serve almost no purpose to the plot and is basically just Terry going \\"look guys, I've done drugs before!\\". Set piece after set piece is trashed/destroyed as a car plows through it or a character runs through one, and the fact that five minutes afterwards none of the set designs stuck with me goes to show that Terry's 'surrealism' is all bark and no bite. The main character's dream sequences weren't much better either, it was some dungeon's and dragon's fantasy that shows that office drones have dreams/aspirations too.<br /><br />So yeah, it's all one big lavish waste of time. The script/message is nothing new to think about if you passed high school, the story is strange and uninvolving and I didn't care about any of the characters or the main characters ultimately selfish aspirations, the only part I did like however was the ending, it was suprisingly grim which was a nice twist on things. If only the ride to that part had been more enjoyable.<br /><br />*Edit* For people telling me I don't 'get' it, wake up, there's nothing to get from this massively overrated live action cartoon geared towards pseudo-intellectuals.Other characters show up I guess to spoon-feed the presumably stoned audience the same boring message over and over: beauracracy bad.

B000P2A24W|4.0|As one would expect from Bon Jovi, this is an impeccably produced CD with near flawless musicianship. However, there's nothing here that hasn't been done before by groups like the Bo Deans and Foster and Lloyd 25 years ago. Additionally, some of the lyrics sound like they were written by an anxiety-filled high school sophomore, which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />If you like easy listening songs, not too deep on philosophy, but with good production values and musicianship, you'll probably like this. I did; it's just not a classic.
B0072X2O66|3.0|Adrenaline Mob have produced a hard rocking metal album that strings together every metal cliche ever used into one very safe listening experience. You would expect that bringing together two forces of metal music in vocalist Russell Allen from Symphony X and legendary drummer Mike Portnoy from Dream Theater would result in some inspired music but it just didn't happen this time. The sound of the album is massive and Portnoy is hammering the drums but the lyrics are very lame and there just aren't enough memorable songs to make this an album made for repeat listening. Highlights include the passionate chorus of \\"All On The Line\\", the grooving ending of \\"Hit The Wall\\", the interesting cover of the Duran Duran song \\"Come Undone\\", and the melodic ballad \\"Angel Sky\\". Despite the pedigree involved, Omerta is an album I can only recommend to die hard fans of these musicians who must have everything they put their talents to and will probably be enjoyed by fans of Black Label Society styled music as well. At least they made a memorable album cover....
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I will have to agree that this the best of the MI series. On the movie front, it shows that gadgets aren't everything and, the mind is still the most dangerous. The plot line and action kept the story moving and interest from waning. I think a good move was showing, at the latter stages,  why someone in the position of Hunt has to forego a serious and long term relationship and, the dangers of having one.

0143038583|5.0|This is one of those books that will open yours eyes to many issues in the food industry. I thought I knew enough about our food, but realized how much more there is to know after reading this book. Interesting, provocative reading with an in-depth look at how we eat, what we eat and where it all comes from. Since I read this book, I picked up his other ones, and they are equally great. That said, The Omnivore's Dilemma is an absolute MUST to read for anyone who eats food. Period.

I truly hated to get to the end of the book. It was heart-wrenching at times, and then LOL funny at other times! Do read!
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Yes, the first DVD is Beatles, but that's to be expected I guess. I thought the product dealt with his spirituality more than his personal life but I found that interesting. I loved the bit with men in suits trying to discuss meditation with George and John. Interviews are great, we hear from Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam too, the Rutles story by Eric is priceless. Extras were good, not just photos labeled as extras. When I saw a Jeff Lynne interview I immediately went to watch it. I've always liked him, another genius IMO! Overall my eyes teared up more than once watching it.<br />Everything to be said has been said here in reviews. Beatles fans will like it. George fans, you need this in your collection!
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I love this cast! Love Gary Oldman and John Hurt, and most especially love Colin Firth. That said, wow, what a dense plot, what straight-faced line delivery, and such confusing cuts back and forth to the past, back to the present. At least I THINK that is what was happening. Don't ask me, though, because I fell sound asleep after about a half hour of wondering if Gary Oldman's character was going to remain silent through the entire film or eventually speak. My husband also fell asleep.<br /><br />Recommendation: For fans of serious, British, ponderous, impenetrable drama.
0345803485|2.0|In my opinion, the book is a cross between the Twilight books and Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum series...  The first book was a little dark for me as well as repetitive (personally, I don't think anyone could have sex that much and still walk).  I wasn't going to read the second book, but the end sucked me in and I went ahead and read the next book.  You know what?  It was just OK.  I wish there had been more to the characters, more to the story, and it had been a little more realistic...
1451637500|4.0|Well, perhaps not *mugged*, but that's how it feels when the book starts out.<br /><br />I should mention that Cryoburn is something like the 14th book in the Vorgkosigan saga. While self-contained, I believe it would be much more enjoyable to someone who has read the whole series. [[ASIN:B005BH9T86 Shards of Honor (Vorkosigan Saga)]] is effectively the beginning of the series, and one of the best of its books, so start there.<br /><br />Cryoburn opens with Miles disoriented and lost, much like the reader, at least for the first few pages. He's been an Imperial Auditor for many years now, and is on assignment on Kibou-daini, a world covered in cryo storage. As the story unfolds, he is helped out by a local urchin named Jin Sato, who winds up playing a central role in the rest of the book.<br /><br />Like most of the books in this series, Cryoburn is a mix of social and political commentary and science fiction. If you're looking for hard sci-fi, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a good, character and plot driven story, and happen to like sci-fi, this is probably a perfect fit for your tastes.<br /><br />Overall one of the better books in the series, though not the best.

B007IQX1G4|1.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie, but when it was over my wife and I mutually went \\"That stunk\\".<br /><br />Great acting and all the characters were very believable, but the story was non existent, to say the least.<br /><br />I am stunned someone funded this movie. I am sure it was funded knowing enough movie goers will be tricked (duped) into watching it that it may make enough $$$ to pay for itself (I hope it does not, I hope some company has a loss on their hands). Patton did a great job, I hope at least he gets some credit and recognition as well as a few other actors. But the \\"It must be decent because Theron is in it\\" sucked me in and burnt me bad. Wow, that was a rip off... So many good movies to watch, and this was not one of them.<br /><br />I figured the trailer moments were a tease of the fun it would be to watch, but the reality is if you take the few good scene's there are, and combine them together, all you have IS the trailer. That's it, this movie could be summed up by the trailer, as the rest was terrible fill...<br /><br />This was a very well acted and well filmed terrible movie. I felt like I was watching a homework project, but that would be an insult to a homework project! Not the worst movie I have EVER seen, but I will not be duped to watch movies because they have an actor I like in it. Thank goodness I only wasted $1.25 at Redbox... Major reminder to read reviews no matter who is in the movie. The saying \\"_______ has never made a bad movie\\" is no longer true for Theron. I am no expert but this must now be one of her worst movies.

B0058YPL66|5.0|Who knew that network television could sustain not one but two programs based on childhood fairy tales?  One of these is the fascinating \\"Once Upon a Time\\", whose premise is that a collection of story book characters have been cursed and frozen in (modern) time and place (the small Maine town of Storybrooke) and are largely unaware of their real identities.  Into this situation walks bail bondsman Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison from \\"House\\"), who stumbles across the son she gave up for adoption ten years.  The son, Henry, has been adopted by Regina Mills (Lana Parilla from \\"Miami Medical\\"), the Mayor of Storybrooke, who doesn't take kindly to Emma's presence.  It is the knowing Henry who explains to the skeptical Emma that her destiny is to end the curse.<br /><br />The plot quickly develops into a nasty rivalry between Emma and Regina over the fate of Henry and the town.  Emma is significantly handicapped by her inability to accept the cursed nature of the town and its inhabitants.  The audience has the benefit of flashbacks that explain the amusing and/or scary backstories of the residents.  Regina is of course the Evil Queen who instigated the curse.  Snow White and her Prince Charming are living in the town, but sadly unaware of their relationship or that Emma is their daughter. Pawn shop owner Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) is a devious Rumpelstiltzskin who plays off Emma and Regina against each other for his own purposes.  Little Red Hood and Pinocchio makes surprising appearences as characters, among others.<br /><br />If the plot can be a little challenging to follow, good acting and a great mixture of humor, drama, and some moral lessons sell the series.  The season finale brings a shocking change to Storybrooke, but viewers will have to watch Season Two to find out what the change means.  \\"Once Upon a Time\\" is highly recommended to its fans.

0375842209|4.0|When he wrote \\"The Book Thief\\", Marcus Zusak thought that he had finally broken out of the young adult genre into the literary world.  His Australian Publisher agreed and marketed the book in the adult market, but his American publisher, Random House, must have been afraid to miss the young adult market.  If you go into a bookstore today, The Book Thief will be in the young adult section along with all his other books.  But the Book Thief did make the jump to the literary world, delving into adult themes that only literary-minded high school students could grasp.<br /><br />Thief follows the life of Liesel from the age of eight to about the age of thirteen, from the age of a child to the age of reason, the age at which a woman-child begins to make her own decisions and begins to see the different shades of color of the world around her.  The story takes her from the complete destruction of her life at eight at the hands of the German army to the complete destruction of her life again at thirteen at the hands of the Allied bombing of Germany. The story charts her life from the ashes of evil to the resurrection of good.<br /><br />The story begins around 1940 when her father leaves the family to join some unknown movement against the Nazi government, a movement that may have been the socialist or communist underground.  Her mother takes Liesel and her brother from the north of Germany, the Lutheran-dominated industrial area which later became East Germany, to the Catholic-dominated Bavaria of southern Germany to live with a couple sympathetic to her father's movement.  With the exception of a few cities, the South tended to be more rural, less industrial, safer from the potential raids and bombings of the Allies, but populated by Germans less educated, who spoke a less refined, heavily accented, more profane language than the sophisticated North.  But in route from the North, her younger brother dies in Liesel's arms.  She and her mother continue to journey where sheis left with the unknown, sympathetic couple.  Liesel stands at the gate of the modest house wailing in grief as her father and mother abandon her now, and death having taken her younger brother, alone with every human relationship in her life stripped away, her life, as she knows it completely destroyed.  Over a period of several years her life is rebuilt around the couple that took her in, new relationships are built as she discovers the world of books and the power and fear of words, and the dangers of daily living gradually shift from fear of the Nazi brown shirts to fear of the Allied bombing.<br /><br /> Zusak uses a motif of color throughout the story as a symbol reinforcing various aspects of the story, but the technique has another purpose.  The only significant novel dealing with the devastation of the Allied bombing was Kurt Vonnegut \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" a novel in which Vonnegut used a motif of light.  A captured American soldier imprisoned in Dresden in the industrial north suffers through the Allied fire bombing of Dresden.  In a theme wrapped around determinism and fatalism, Vonnegut weaves a story of the hopelessness of the life of common man, lives completely out of their control, where they have no choice, No freewill, they live in a prison only to await death.<br /><br />By pointing subtle arrows toward \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" Zusak is challenging Vonnegut's fatalistic view of life.  While Liesel is completely stripped of every human relationship in her life at age eight and again at thirteen, each time the community reaches out to take her into their arms.  This is not a melodramatic tale but a story of how common man reaches out and circles around others in their community.  Zusak draws a portrait of the good in man even in the worst of destruction, contrary to Vonnegut's fatalistic view of the evil of mankind and the purposeless of life.

0439023521|5.0|With over seven thousand reviews and counting, it seems almost redundant to write about the Hunger Games. Yet since everyone in the world seems to be talking about this book, I guess it's time to fall in line and add my two cents. By now it's pretty well documented that Suzanne Collins got the idea for \\"The Hunger Games\\" late one late when channel flicking, finding that clips from reality television and news footage of the war in Iraq were blurring in her mind. From there, the concept of the Hunger Games was born: a competition in which twenty-four young people are trapped inside an arena with weapons, tools, and a single objective: to kill each other until only one remains. Glory and wealth awaits this sole survivor.<br /><br />It's a gripping idea, but it needs context. Thus Collins has devised a dystopian future in which a wealthy, decadent city known as the Capitol maintains totalitarian control over twelve districts that produce food, energy, coal and other raw materials for it. As a way of reminding the population that it is in complete control, the Capitol randomly selects two tributes (a boy and a girl) from each district every year and forces them to partake in the Hunger Games, which are then broadcast live to Capitol and districts alike. Whilst the districts watch their children die, the people of the Capitol view it all as extreme entertainment, and can bet on the winners, sponsor their favorites, and send supplies into the arena to give their contestants an edge.<br /><br />Next come the characters to go with such a winning premise and setting. Katniss Everdeen is the book's protagonist, a seventeen year old girl from Distinct 12. With her father killed in a mining accident and her mother still grief-stricken over his death, Katniss is the breadwinner of the household. She frequently goes poaching in the nearby woods with her friend Gale, all in order to provide for her little sister Primrose.<br /><br />But at that year's reaping Prim's name is pulled out of the lottery, and it doesn't take a genius to release that Katniss will volunteer to play in her place. She and her companion Peeta Mallark, the baker's boy, are whisked off to the Capitol to be fed, groomed, styled, interviewed, trained and eventually escorted into the arena. But Katniss and Peeta utilize a unique strategy to give them an edge: to increase their popularity and gain more sponsors, the two of them pretend to be deeply in love. Naturally this performance masks what may or may not be truer feelings between them, an added level of complexity to a scenario in which everyone's first impulse is basic survival.<br /><br />Between these three components, it's no wonder that \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a bestseller. If there's one thing that any reader would be hard-pressed to deny, it's the book's near-perfect pacing. There is not a dull moment from start to finish, not a word wasted or a paragraph padded. Never before have I been so unconscious of how quickly I turned pages, and I had completed the book and was ready to move onto the sequel in a matter of hours.<br /><br />The idea of sporting matches in which the participants play for their lives is not exactly a new one. The entire plot is reminiscent of [[ASIN:1421527723 Battle Royale]], [[ASIN:0451197968 The Running Man]], [[ASIN:B001EC0OPY Thunderdome]], [[ASIN:B003PIUBZS Spartacus]], and of course, the reality TV show [[ASIN:B0001ZDKXI Survivor]] were that show actually *about* life-or-death survival and not middle-class Americans fending for themselves in the wilderness. To accuse Suzanne Collins of plagiarism is rather disingenuous considering the regularity with which this trope reoccurs in fiction, especially since it was the Romans who set the precedent, what with their gladiatorial arenas. Along with a nod to Greek mythology (twenty-four was the number of youths sent from Athens to Crete each year to be sacrificed to the Minotaur), Collins chose to call her world \\"Panem\\", an allusion to the phrase \\"panem et circenses\\" (or \\"bread and circuses\\") coined by the Roman satirist Juvenal in order to describe the aspirations of a population that are happy to give up civic responsibilities in exchange for basic needs and entertainment. Furthermore, dozens of Roman names are strewn throughout the novel (including Flavia, Cato, Portia and Seneca, among others) making it very clear where Collins drew her inspiration from.<br /><br />Collins is restrained about divulging details concerning the post-apocalyptic world she's created. Though Panem is implied to be in North America, the state of the rest of the world remains a complete mystery, and details about the society, politics and technology of the future are disclosed to the reader on a need-to-know basis. Though Collins is scant on the world-building, this actually ends up working in the book's favor, as the reader isn't bogged down with needless detail on how everything came to be in this rather disquieting glimpse into our potential future.<br /><br />Likewise, I was rather surprised at the on-line debates surrounding the love triangle between Gale/Katniss/Peeta - it was pretty clear to me that Katniss would have unhesitatingly forsaken them both in order to save her little sister, and the romantic entanglements (particularly in this book) barely constitute a subplot. Perhaps the focus on this aspect of the story was a side effect of the prominent endorsements from Stephenie Meyer splattered all over the covers and spines of the book. I gotta say, they're a little strange. As far as female protagonists so, Katniss is the polar opposite of Meyer's bland, whiny, co-dependent Bella, and every time I put the book aside and glimpsed Meyer's name, I couldn't help but laugh at the image of Bella in Katniss's environment. She wouldn't last twelve seconds, and the only thing that the two books have even *remotely* in common is that they're both told by the teenage protagonist in first-person narration. Collins really excels in bringing Katniss to life: she's stoic, determined, relentless, uncompromising, and more than a little clueless when it comes to emotions and relationships.<br /><br />As such, the book is made up of short, fragmented sentences that get the point across and no more. Katniss isn't one to wax lyrical about the sunset or the wind in the trees or her boyfriend's \\"tousled hair and crooked smile\\" - she's got more important stuff to concentrate on, and the writing style conveys this throughout the story.<br /><br />Though \\"The Hunger Games\\" is a riveting read, there are a couple of flaws in this first installment that bear pointing out, namely that Collins raises some sticky moral dilemmas, but never really explores them. It's convenient, for example, that Katniss's kills in the arena are all self-defense and that she's never required to kill a fellow combatant in cold blood (not yet anyway). Likewise, there are a couple of deaths that are blatantly manipulative. Still, these shortcomings count for little when the power of the pacing and the nail-biting tension of the plot sweep you up into the story. It's an addictive rollercoaster ride, and you're going to want to have the sequel [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire]] on hand directly afterwards.se \\"panem et circenses\\" (or \\"bread and circuses\\") coined by the Roman satirist Juvenal in order to describe the aspirations of a population that are happy to give up civic responsibilities in exchange for basic needs and entertainment.

B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Graphics are great, along with ease of zooming in and not losing resolution. I really like that you can use a timer or not - I prefer the timer since sit makes it more exciting for me. I also like that your are penalized for clicking mu ltiple times without results - that was a flaw I  saw in other G5 games. Overall pretty good, but my biggest complaint is the picture that was chosen for the main page - I almost didn't buy it because of that!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is addicting and great for little kids. in Ice Age Village, you are allowed to create your own zoo. If you ask me, this is just as good as tap zoo, tap safari, tappily ever after, and tap dragon park. they are all the same almost but have a different theme for a zoo. I believe 100% that you will enjoy this app.
B005IZLPME|3.0|I was on the fence with this film the first time I saw it, but I liked it a bit more the second time around.  I appreciated the performances, humor and character development more, and after seeing \\"The Avengers\\" and then re-watching this film I had more appreciation for the tie-in with that blockbuster.  It also tied in nicely with the \\"Iron Man\\" films (don't want to say how or that might spoil it for some).  However, the pace of this film was a bit on the slow side for my taste, and I didn't really care for Steve Rogers' merry band of soldiers or Red Skull.  (The same type of serum that turned Rogers into a super soldier turned another guy's head red and made his nose fall off? What's up with that?)<br /><br />The visual effects used to reduce Chris Evans from his usual pumped up, muscular self to a 90-lb. weakling were amazing, and the effects were good throughout most of the film.  However, there were a couple of scenes where I thought the effects still needed some work, like the flying wing and few moments that looked like the actors were standing in front of green screens.<br /><br />Anyway, there were some funny moments and good action scenes, and the HD and 7.1 presentation was great.  The 3D effects were disappointing though.  This wasn't really a surprise given the fact that the movie was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D in post production.  The titles and main menu utilized the 3D gimmick well, but not much else.<br /><br />One question remains though: why does Captain America bother to wear a cowl when the world knows his identity? Seems pointless, and his costume looks better without it.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|I decided to watch this the another night with 4 friends that will normally sit through anything - especially if we paid for it. Usually at worst we can entertain ourselves by mocking the movie if it is lame. This was an exception. It wasn't even worth mocking... we just all sat there scratching our heads. The movie struck me as an art students attempt to overuse every possible film stylization ad nauseam. As some of the other reviewers said; absolute waste of time and money. If only we had stuck with watching the trailer.... it was the most entertaining thing they filmed for this movie.
B006QR2888|2.0|Fairly poor vinyl transfer. The turntable/cartridge was not properly set up and you can hear lots of anomalies. There are several other versions of this that are much better. You won't get the mono verion but, for me, it was so distracting that I got rid of the CD since I wouldn't listen to it. The music is still classic but the rating of 2 stars reflects the quality of this product.
0439023513|1.0|Suzanne should have named this book Selfish Mockingjay, because that is what Katniss is. I really hate this book and wish i never read it. How can an Author destroy all her with one book. She just gave Peeta the most awful horrible person,to end up with. The book should of ended with her alone, because that's what she deserved. Poor Peeta, the only reason i read the poor. A real disappointment. And first person narrative is really not working for her. you can get away with it if she wrote Peeta etc side of the story.

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|I thought 'The Grey' was well worth the rental price. The plane crash sequence was done wonderfully and I found myself actually 'feeling' it.  For what it was, it was acted well, and the meaning behind the movie was great.<br />  My only 'glitch' with the movie is that I believe someone should have survived.  Didn't have to be Neeson or anyone in particular, just someone.  Also, I don't think it would have been too difficult to have constructed some types of better weapons from plane parts, to fend off the wolves.  They all had knives.  What happened to knives on sticks for spears?
B003VANOFY|5.0|Been using this for about a month now, and sound quality is awesome. I use it to play BF3, Skyrim, and Diablo 3.  I have not had any issues with the mic's performance in either Ventrillo, Teamspeak, or BF3's Battlelog chat function.  Battery seems to be fine. I used it the day of D3's release in Teamspeak for 6 hours. Range is good also.  I can easily go to the kitchen or bathroom without signal loss. When you are not using the mic and it is in the up position, it has an automatic mute function, and when you mute it when in the down position, there is a red LED light indicating it is muted. Plenty of room from the cushion to the actual speakers themselves to eliminate the dreaded ear pain from wearing them too long.  Only down side is your ears do slightly prespire during extended use, but the ear pieces swivel 90 degrees to allow a quick break.  Well worth the $$ if you don't want to be tied to your PC.

0061743526|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel about growing up in Maycomb, Alabama in 1933.  Scout and Jem adore their father, Atticus, who is a lawyer.  Their mother has died and Calpurnia is their African American housemaid who cares for them most of the time.  They have a friend who visits each summer and the three of them have plans to get their reclusive neighbor Boo Radley out of his house.  Scout is a precocious narrator whose innocence leaps off the page.  Scout is a pants wearing, tree climbing, tough girl much to her aunt's chagrin.<br /><br />Around 1934, a black man is accused of raping a white girl.  Atticus Finch agrees to defend Tom Robinson in court even though he knows he is going to lose.  This is a hard lesson for Scout and Jem.  People call them names and start fights but Atticus is firm in the belief that you must fight for truth and what you believe in, no matter what.  The trial of Tom Robinson is convincing and like the children, the reader roots for the defendant.  As Scout and Jem lose their innocence and learn the world is not a fair place for all, the reader is reminded of history and injustice.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird is historical fiction at its finest.  Maycomb, Alabama may be a fictional place but the reality of a southern small town, full of racist attitudes and a social class system that perpetuates a hatred of the lower class, is and was very much alive across America.  Lee has written a book about the loss of innocence children face as they grow up and discover the world is not equal.  To Kill a Mockingbird is at times, funny, poignant, and heart-breaking.  It is truly an American classic.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961.  It is the only book written and published by Harper Lee.  The book is currently read nationwide in schools.  However, I never read it in school or college.<br />My son Max brought a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird home and said his English class was reading the book.  I was shocked that he was assigned this book as a 7th grader.  I read To Kill a Mockingbird about 20 years ago and decided it was the perfect time to reread it alongside my son.  Reading this book as a parent gave me a different perspective.  What age did you read To Kill a Mockingbird?

Hopefully, better designs, faster development, and... overall happiness! Very pleased with this book, and while only half-way through it, I'm already considering a few follow-on books. Also, Head First has other books which look interesting.<br />Suggestion - the authors recommend you fully immerse yourself in the contents and exercises within. Do that! It really pays off.

The North Korean young people ask permission of their parents for each<br />plan they make .  One can't help but compare the respect North Korean parents receive from their children.<br />Our children demand to get everything they want - they are such spoiled unpleasant people.<br /><br />So, I predict most reviewers will note the richness in our own country compared to the poverty of the<br />North Korean citizens.<br />It is terrible that they are starving.  My heart breaks for them.  God Bless the North Koreans and Give<br />Them Hope and Peace through Jesus Christ, Our Lord.

0439023513|1.0|Loved the first two, too many unresolved issues in the third. Characters I loved absent and uninvolved. Not a series I would read again and I would not recommend reading the third book to anyone.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|I'm not sure how this movie could get good reviews? The characters are completely unlikable and unbelievable while also being used for social commentary. The movie was much too long and they could have edited 30-40 minutes out (or more). I watched the black-and-white version because I'm an early film fan, but this movie doesn't even deserve having a black-and-white version. Not to mention the snap-zooms and other poor techniques that are uncharacteristic of black-and-white cinema. The ending for the movie barely made it more interesting and overall I would recommend this title to nobody.

0553278398|5.0|Compared to the rest of the Foundation trilogy, this book explores the mechanisms behind psychohistory, while the others tend to focus on the consequences and effects of applying psychohistory.<br />This is a great book for an armchair psychologist or sociologist as it explores the inner workings of societies and groups of people, and their effect on the individual.<br />I find that even though the \\"futuristic\\" technology in the books seems dated, the book as a whole is still relevant because its description of human group behaviour is still relevant.<br />It isn't hard to picture different cultures in the book living in today's society, and the protagonist's position as an emigrant from another planet is perfect for exploring the oddities of their -and our- world.<br />While there are action scenes in the novel, it is fairly analytical, and a significant portion of the development takes place in conversation, which is a detractor for some readers.<br />This is great if you want to have a big long think!
0060254920|5.0|[[ASIN:0060254920 Where the Wild Things Are]]<br /><br />I can remember enjoying this book when I was a child and continue to love it as an adult.  I have read this book to both my children and they have also enjoyed listening to it.<br /><br />Reading and seeing Max' imagination come to life makes it much more exciting.  Maurice Sendak really demonstrated his creativity in his illustrations throughout the book.  It shows how Max' imagination become lively in his mind and takes over his room.  I absolutely love how Sendak slowly changes and adds to the bedroom and transforms it into a jungle. The design of the book is magnificent from the beginning of the story showing small pictures to them eventually taking over both pages as the plot thickens and the wild rumpus begins.  There are very minimal words to read but this picture book has great illustrations that a story can be told from them.  Maurice Sendak was a talented author and illustrator.<br /><br />This book shows how a child's imagination can easily run wild from the ordinary life.  The creativity and detail of the monsters and jungle show how a child such as Max might imagine the unknown.  I can understand why this creativity and detail can have some controversy but it shows how many children might view their surroundings.

To the even more terrifying howl of the stalking wolves sound is used in the film to expertly convey the truely terrifying state these men have found themselves in. This is the movie that tests your thinking on many levels. Would you lay down to die when hope seems lost?\\" These questions you will ask yourself while having your senses completely assualted. This is survival horror at it's best.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was excited about this book.  Finally an erotica book that had gone mainstream.  I no longer had to hide in the dark reading my smut.  I thought this book must be written so much better than any other erotica I had ever read.  It wasn't.  The language is fairly elementary, the characters are not well developed and their interactions seem unbelievable.  Yes, it is fiction, but a person reads a book in order to get lost in the characters and ultimately believe that in some other existence the characters could exist..these, not so much.<br />The sex scenes, which is why we read erotica..right, leave a lot to be desired.
0061120073|3.0|While Betty Smith's A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN will never rival Henry Roth's CALL IT SLEEP for so-called high-brow literature, the two books have something in common:  pluck.  In the eminently readable A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN, Smith shows it to us in the Nolans--a half Irish-, half Austrian-American family at home(s) in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  In CALL IT SLEEP, Roth uses stream-of-consciousness alongside narrative descriptions of squalor and depravity on the Lower East Side of Manhattan to show us--if you'll allow a clunky metaphor--an alternative definition of pluck:  namely, \\"the heart, liver, windpipe and lungs of a slaughtered animal\\" (American Heritage Dictionary).<br /><br />Is it fair to say that one novel is better than the other, that one writer is more accomplished than the other?  I think it is.  Henry Roth wins hands down.<br /><br />If Roth's novel deals with depravity, Smith's deals with deprivation.  The difference between Roth's David Schearl (the beaten young \\"hero\\" of CALL IT SLEEP) and Smith's Francie Nolan (the coming-of-age heroine of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN) is no less than that between resignation and hope.  On Manhattan's Lower East Side in the first two decades of the last century, 'hope' would've been a cynical sluice to the East River and its pollutants.  In the Williamsburg ghetto of the same period, 'hope' would've been the only dyke keeping that same river and its pollutants at bay.  Hope, for the heroes of both stories, is just a well-appreciated resting place along the way to resignation.<br /><br />If there's any similarity between the two novels, it's to be found in Chapter 43 of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.  This--at least to *my* way of thinking--is where Betty Smith's prose shines with a brilliance equal to Roth's.<br /><br />Why, then, would I here suggest that Roth is the better writer?  In deciding upon the virtues of the harp or the lyre versus the trombone or the tuba, first consider the player--as much the reviewer as the author.  I find that Roth takes me deeper into his characters and into their immediate circumstances while Smith tweaks me as a reader.  For my money, she's a bit too heavy-handed in jerking the obvious tear.<br /><br />Would I read either or both once again?  Unequivocally, yes.  I've already read CALL IT SLEEP twice.  I may one day invest in a second reading of A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN.<br /><br />If, in a word or two, I had to characterize the two novels, I'd say that CALL IT SLEEP stretches the brain cells while A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN tugs at the heart strings.  Either way, you can't lose.  But what do *I* know?  CALL IT SLEEP had to wait thirty years to find an appreciable (and appreciative) audience; meanwhile, A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN was an instant success.  Is there a more fitting--and telling--tribute to the American myth?  Ms. Smith, meet Mr. Horatio Alger.hor.

B0083GQKQG|5.0|Like others have mentioned, the warning about how disturbing this film is cannot be underestimated.<br /><br />But I rated it 5 stars because, unlike so many films about spree killers, it takes no moral stand. It simply shows the potential effects of such psychoses on everyone, but particularly on the immediate, surviving family.<br /><br />I will disagree with the other reviewers here about feelings of holding the mother partially responsible. I believe this film shows the very real probability that the mother merely reacts to the obviously errant development of the child who becomes a psychotic killer. She does, indeed, seek help. Only to be rebuffed by doctors and experts; labeled as an hysterical mother.<br /><br />As a student of neuropsychology, and a long-term ponderer of the psychology of those who kill, I have come to believe that the biology of the brain of these kinds of killers is congenital. Genetic? Maybe. Maybe not.  But inborn? Positively.<br /><br />And this film explores that possibility. Tilda Swinton plays the hapless mother of the congenitally disturbed Kevin and does so brilliantly. Her character's growing fear of the title character, who plays her against her husband's life of denial (Reilly, played perfectly), is palpable. This grittily realistic woman makes you ponder how you would handle such a difficult reality.<br /><br />Of course, that is exactly the point, in my opinion. My heart breaks for her, as she lives out the consequences of ignorance in the public, who blame her for her son's evil acts. Personally, my opinion is that no matter how lurid the childhood of killers, it is nature (in the formation of the physical brain), not nurture (in the rearing), that creates a killer such as Kevin.<br /><br />Too many children have been raised with horrors far beyond those this title character endures; yet they do not kill. It seems to me this film points out that Kevin was born with no capacity for empathy, and, worse, with a keen appetite for torture.  Particularly satisfying to him is the torture of his mother. It is disturbing in the extreme to see how well he ultimately conquers her completely.  And in stealing from her a peaceful life, he condemns her to a fate worse than his own in prison.<br /><br />In the end, it asks us to ponder how we would feel if it happened to us. Which causes much discomfort, because of the protective mechanism in our minds that leads us to find reasons it could not happen to us. But maybe it can.torture.

B005LAIGW8|1.0|This new version for the GHOSTRIDER was just as bad as the first if not worst . I would not waste my money or time on it, the acting and story could have been much better.  Mr. Cage as the Rider, thought that they would have learned from the first movie that he was a bad choice (The Worst choice) that could have been made. I was lucky and only spent $2.00 to see Spirit of Vengeance and was very disapointed in that and if I was hard up for money I would have asked for my 2 bucks back.  The only good thing I could say about this verison was the FX was perty good, but not worth seeing or buying.

B005LAIH2W|3.0|I wish there were some way to give this movie a 2.5 on this website, because I'm being VERY generous giving it 3 out of 5 stars. The only reason I'm doing so is because I felt the movie was not as bad as all the so-called \\"Top Critics\\" who really bashed it said it was.<br /><br />In 'John Carter of Mars' (which, if you're from an older generation, you'll know is an adaptation of writer Edgar Rice Burroughs' 'Barsoom' novels), Taylor Kitsch (who played Gambit in 'Wolverine: Origins', and also starred in the TV series 'Friday Night Lights') plays John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army Captain now searching for wealth, to get away from the several different party's hunting him, and to escape from failures in his past. When Carter ends up in the cave of gold he was searching for, he ends up killing a being known as a Thern, and is accidentally transported to \\"Barsoom\\" (the real name for Mars in the novels). Carter is taken prisoner by the Green Martians, but discovers that he has the ability to leap great distances & perform feats of great strength due to his different bone density & adaptation to Earth's higher gravity. Carter soon finds himself caught in the middle of a Civil War between the two Red Martian (who are more human looking) cities, and finds a love interest in the form of a Princess named Dejah Thoris (played here by Lynn Collins, who also starred in 'Wolverine: Origins' as Silverfox).<br /><br />Despite my insistence that the film was not that bad, there is no denying that 'John Carter of Mars' WAS a bad movie. There are a lot of impressive effects, but nothing really special that we haven't seen from other space-themed movies such as 'Star Wars', 'Star Trek', 'Babylon 5', etc; the cast is horrible (only Taylor Kitsch who plays the main character seems like he was actually TRYING to act); the story is long, difficult to follow, & doesn't really hold your attention all the time; and really Disney? You let a PIXAR director who has never directed a live action movie direct this film??? You can tell the director did not know what he was doing, as the style & visualization for this film is really bland.<br /><br />Bottom line, I'd only recommend this movie if you were a fan of the 'Barsoom' novels, or if you're under the age of 12. Also, make sure you rent the movie first before you decide to spend the money to purchase it.

B003O86FMW|2.0|I was sorely disappointed in Catching Fire. Mainly because the book builds up a beautiful premise for a rebellion and uprising, but then abruptly abandons this direction and heads straight for d&eacute;ja vu. The book immediately takes off where the Hunger Games ends. The victory tour, and life-changing status rank from Katniss' POV are enthralling. Her perception of Capital culture juxtaposed between life in the Seam has a lot of unexpected comedic relief, and lightheartedness. Less than halfway through the book is where the buildup of suspense screeches to a grinding halt. We're thrown from this plot evolution and it just sits there.<br /><br />[START SPOILER] We're thrown back into the arena for the 75th annual games, which happens to be the Quarter Quell. An event celebrated every 25 years that changes the tradtional dynamics of how tributes are chosen. This year, victors from the previous games are drawn from a pool of 59 living winners to compete in the 75th reaping. Peeta and Katniss are once again forced to compete this year. [END SPOILER]<br /><br />It causes the plot to be interrupted. We never hear from it again in this book. We are suddenly introduced to new characters. (Some stay, others don't). Once again, Gale's opportunity for character development is stolen from this change in plot. We don't get to know much more about him other than some backstory. The pacing is so incredibly slow that I found myself rushing through the last 65 pages, not caring what I missed.<br /><br />Catching Fire steals much of the raw emotion from The Hunger Games and beats us over the head with it. It's completely unnecessary and mind-numbingly rehashed. It nearly ruined the desire to even want to read Mockingjay. One of the new characters introduced (Finnick) is the ONLY reason that kept me reading cover to cover. He's more interesting than one might think.<br /><br />This book could have easily been condensed by about 50% into Part one or Part three.<br /><br />I honestly would suggest someone who has read all the books to give specific spoilers from the second half from Catching Fire, so you can skip it and start Mockingjay.<br /><br />****** About the movie ******<br /><br />The movie was a flawless adaptation that is very entertaining and well-shot. It has a completely different, engaging feel to it.

0439023513|3.0|I shouldn't be surprised by the number of mixed reviews this has. What I will say is that the book (unlike Hunger Games and Catching fire) is more about fighting the politics of Panem, rather than another story about the arena. The book strips down every single ounce of idealism and hurls the reader into a ground-zero war zone story of realism. The idea of a warm and fuzzy ending is completely crushed. Whichever main character you enjoyed reading about, has their personality negatively altered to a victim of war trauma. They are not the same person they once were.    Positives:    Katniss (whom I've always seen as affirmative, resilient to trauma, and undermining authority) is whittled down to a very down-to-earth, grief-stricken young woman with lapses of PTSD. The story is now told through the eyes of someone who does have the capability to make foolish decisions and be emotionally weak. A major offense to some. I, however saw this as a positive. She has personality flaws that she finally becomes aware of.....but then ignores them. Choices have to be made for her because of outright non-compliance.    Because of her current instability, (and Peeta's....\\"absence\\" from the storyline) the book gives other characters a chance to shine. Finnick, Gale, Plutarch, and Boggs in particular help weave the plot into something worth caring about and lingering for. Katniss does pick herself up and becomes the Joan of Arc character that everyone around her demands her to be. A very amateur Joan that doesn't come close to District 13's propaganda. (Something I really enjoyed. A message within a story about how media sells the romanticism of war and the hero/heroine. When in reality, the battlefield doesn't even come close to the bits of airtime we see on TV.)    Haymitch has a fleshed out, powerful personality. I genuinely cared more about him than the central main characters.    Negatives:    What I found irritating was the general self-absorbed, push-and-pull of the narrative.The whole \\"Will I? or Won't I?\\" thought process is dragged through the mud. She agonizes over EVERY. SINGLE. DECISION. again and again. Its relentlessness gets to a point where I found myself saying \\"Oh shut up and make up your mind!\\" Katniss is not THAT inwardly focused. It also has a \\"told, but not illustrated\\" feel to it. We don't get to experience the grief and pain. We're just told what happens in a statement like way, and the story continues on.    Speaking of \\"Will they or won't they?\\" The love story is neatly tucked away until the very end. With a very short epilogue to sum it up. Quite anti-climatic, but I was relieved to see it take a backseat to the trilogy.    Near the end, there is less of a climax, and more of a gore-fest. WAY too many characters are needlessly killed off. Two in particular frustrated me to the point of actually walking away from the book, so I could grieve their deaths, and resume reading.      Final thoughts:      I've heard a lot of complaints about the ending. I thought it was fine, but I **REALLY** hated the epilogue. (can't spoil it here).     People need to stop demanding super-human resilience from their characters, and accept that they cope with problems like the rest of us would.  Who knows? With this much complaining over the book, maybe the ending will be thrown out in the movie so we can all get drunk off the happy ending we really wanted. Since we just won't have it any other way.over it and live happily ever after\\".<br /><br />Who knows?

0345803493|4.0|I was shocked when reading the first book at how explicit it was, this book is much more toned down.  There's still some of the detailed sex scenes such as from book one but I felt in a MUCH lesser manner.  I found this book more enjoyable for that reason because it seemed to actually attempt to hold a storyline.<br /><br />This book also (like book 1) just ends.  You go to turn the page but it's over.  It's somewhat frustrating.  I have not purchased the third book because I have numerous other books on my to read list but I will say, I enjoyed this book more than the first and for those of you who thought there was \\"too much porn\\" or whatnot in the first, this one is much quieter in that aspect without withdrawing it.  It's definitely not as erotic or kinky or crazy as the first one.<br /><br />You learn more about the mysterious Christian Grey in this book and that was a fun change of pace as I am not one to go in search of sex books but prefer a book with a good story to keep me entertained.
