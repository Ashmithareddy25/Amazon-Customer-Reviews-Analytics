B0001ENYKS|5.0|Excellent debut! How about some sound samples for the none believers.
B00008LDPU|1.0|I rented this thinking it would be awsome, it had like all these sites saying the animations was awsome. When i saw the first like minuit animation thing i thought, thats good. then the rest... ohhhh the rest... I literally shut off my VCR while watching like the 7th one. This was the most reduculous thing i have ever seen. No offense to those who like it. But i would STRONGLY not reccomend even wasting the 2 bucks to rent it at a video store.
B000002N25|5.0|I rarely give five stars, but I could not give less... This is completely dreamy music... I adore it. I'm a long-time fan of MK and this music has the intrinsic flow of intensity that one would expect out of a songwriter that is new to music, rather than the seasoned legend he is -- probably because that's what MK is trying to convey in his music... a return to the songwriter's passion in a very simplified, down to earth way. I love it and am looking forward to listening to the others he's done as well. Highly recommended to anyone that loves romantic love songs with a little mystery and attitude thrown in.
B00004WGAI|5.0|This is the first Jane Eyre production I saw but since then I have seen other versions.  But I still choose this one far above the rest. Though I do admit I have not seen the Ciarn Hinds/Samantha Morton version yet.  I have heard mixed reviews on that version but I do highly recommend if you like this try seeing Ciarn Hinds/Amanda Root version of Persuasion, for it is excellent.  I also highly recommend if you like this try out Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle it is also excellent.
0385512104|5.0|This book is a great read for a variety of audiences. I took a chance and picked it for our book club and everyone loved it!!! Very well written, it will give you a great overview of autism along with a heart warming story.
B00012FXAE|5.0|The debate over which film--Alien or Aliens--is better appears to be unending. It must be noted that both films are crucial to the sci-fi genre and represent the best of their respective sub-genres (Alien: sci-fi/horror; Aliens: sci-fi/action), but, from the standpoint of well-rounded filmmaking, it is truly Aliens that is the victor. <br />Simply put, James Cameron recognized the shortcomings of the first film (lack of adequate character development and lack of a more suitable pace for a broader audience) and improved upon them so much, that Sigourney Weaver's character (Ripley) showed up on the cover of Time in 1986. The said shortcomings of the first film weren't really shortcomings at all in context (the first film is designated as a horror film, because we're made to not care about the characters so that we can feel jumpy about the timing of their deaths and be caught up in the atmosphere that the slower pacing creates), but, in order to take audiences to new places and really make the &quot;Alien&quot; monster a fright for the ages, we needed a &quot;show.&quot; Again, Cameron did this with so much bravado, that it put people (such as critic, Roger Ebert) in a state of silence after first seeing it. The suspense is simply unrelenting once the machine gun magazine clips begin to unload on countless alien baddies (this film also boasts an unexpectedly creative and maternal mom vs. mom showdown of true &quot;science fiction&quot; proportions and curious metaphor). You don't feel &quot;good&quot; after this film, but you'll walk away with truly memorable characters (you'll likely find yourself quoting Bill Paxton after seeing it), an increased heart rate, further commentary on corporate corruption, a truly superior display of action filmmaking by Cameron, and, thanks to Cameron again, a female lead that forever changed stereotypes for women in film.<br />This is an important film and demands the viewer's full attention.
B000084T18|1.0|Ask yourself this - why do you never see any of the \\"Top 500 Amazon Reviewers\\" reviewing crap like this or any rap for that matter.<br />OK, I'll tell you the answer. Because...it sucks. Nothing but 12 year old white wannabe gangsters listen to this and uneducated people with no jobs that own huge suburbans.<br />I personally don't like ANY rap but I do have respect for Outkast...and let me tell you something, that is where the future of rap music is going.<br />Not this.....garbage (to put it kindly)
B00000J5Z6|5.0|Been a long time fan of bob marley it was one of the greatest delight of my life when i first saw this cd. I was not disappointed the renditions are superd. For all monty and by extension marley fans this is a must have.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|An outstanding show!  Innovative and intelligent.  Joss Whedon, creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, always provides fantastic writing and attention to detail.  Together with Tim Minear and a stellar cast and crew, he has created a show that should bring in new fans as well.  While set 500 years in the future, the show speaks to situations and issues that people face now.  Firefly is visually interesting, intellectually stimulating, emotionally poignant and hi-larious.  The complexity makes repeated viewing a joy.<P>The violence may bother some people, but it is not gratuitous.
B00005CDNK|5.0|ABBA have really done a great job on this one.This album is a REAL clencher.By far I have to say that &quot;The Visitors&quot; is by far my best loved album.They sound so much more matured in their music style and vocals..This album appeared in the year 1981,sadly at a difficult time for the group.This LP had been a huge hit on it's release,but as it was said,this was not the happy-go-lucky ABBA back in the 70's.The lyrics seem much more complex than previous!During the release of this album,there were however many major events taking place for the individual members..Bjorn got re-married,was one..the ladies had already embarked on solo careers....The guys were at work together on the side though with Tim Rice on another musical project,&quot;The Chess&quot;.Details can be found about all this if you buy the remastered issues of the LP.<BR>   The songs I loved best were &quot;The Visitors&quot; of course,&quot;Head Over Heels&quot;,&quot;When All Is Said And Done&quot;,&quot;Soldiers&quot; and &quot;Slipping Through My Fingers&quot;.<BR>   To begin with this album had started off in a bright spirited and lively atmosphere,but had gradually become reflective and gloomy later.You could tell that the impending shadows of their separation was in clear view.But I loved every song so much...I listened to it everyday!&quot;The Visitors&quot; track opens the album,and is a nice sophisticated song by ABBA...dancey and colorful.I was smiling pleasantly at the track on first hearing.Obviously the group were looking to make a come-back of some kind.But it had a disastrous chart placement....in the US charts.Their once massive appeal to producing singles had declined and so this song had payed the price....but it is a lovely track.The next two tracks namely &quot;Head Over Heels&quot; and &quot;When All Is Said and Done&quot; follow the title track in musical complexity and style...Magnificent work again!Dancey and bouncy tunes all the way....These tracks had also had a limitedchart success,I wondered why.The track &quot;Soldiers&quot; is quite a sultry track.A rare piece by ABBA.&quot;Soldiers write the songs that soldiers sing,that u and I won't sing.....&quot; I don't understand the meaning but it sounds great,classy drumming by Per Lindvall...feels like I could have started marching in tune with the drum and saluting too!!   hehe.They are trying different styles of music which I liked.Now the next one &quot;I let The Music Speak&quot; is a slow and reflective song,featuring Annifrid on the lead.She sounds better on slow tracks like this.The music to say was more suited for a theatrical work more.....again they are trying out new musical styles.This was a hit but not succesful enough...&quot;One Of Us&quot;,obviously is quite autobiographical in nature.Their lives are depicted here.Music is just amazingly done and suits the mood of this track.U will definitely feel the pain that they themselves were feeling back then....Nice sing-a-long vocals too.I loved it...&quot;Two For The Price Of One&quot;,oh yeah....this is really something.Attractive,not so usual musical stlye that they usually pursue,it was sophisticated again!!The track speaks of a man who had no personal life to look forward to,who by chance looks up an ad.in the newspaper and finds,u could get two girls at a price for one...if the guy was &quot;feeling blue&quot; in life.Nice story and the track ends with the sound of weding bells.This is a strong track,a track worth the entire album,cause u won't get this track anywhere else.The second last  track on the CD was &quot;Slipping thro'My Fingers&quot;.Ahh....I can never get bored of this one.This track will speak volumes for itself...some tracks are better left unsaid...U gotta hear it and enjoy.It's definitely a personal fav.for me.Lastly a slow and pensive track &quot;Like An Angel Passing Through My Room&quot;...that closes &quot;THe Visitors&quot; LP/CD.U will hear the sound of a ticking clock,acompanied by Annifrid's voice.It was generated by Benny playing on the synthesizer....It is surely a farewell song to us all....Oh my!.The words go ....&quot;long awaited darkness falls,castings shadows on the walls,in the twilight hour I am alone.....and it all comes after me tonight...in the gloom,Like An angel passing thro' my room.....&quot; well I felt the gloom as well!This album was effectively and surely ABBA's farewell album to us all...I feel they should have stayed longer ,sad though.A bright and brief career has left me shaken and thrilled.In a way this is my tribute to them.Lovely stylish music and vocals here for us all.I highly recommend this album to all!.On my CD I have addtl. tracks like &quot;Should I Lauh Or Cry&quot;,&quot;Under Attack&quot;,&quot;The Day Before U Came&quot; and &quot;You Owe Me One&quot;....These songs together with the original tracks make this album a great ABBA purchase.Go for it!!Don't their cover picture look great as well?? Beautiful and candid.
B0001GOH6Q|2.0|Went with eager anticipation to see this one.  Ended up bored to death, looking at the time wondering when it would all end.  Interesting premise, amazing visuals but way too drawn out.  I was with 3 other people and we were all disappointed.  Expected much better.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I heard all the accolades this movie received so I went and bought it on DVD without renting it first. BIG MISTAKE. I couldn't tell you how horrible this movie is with just a 1000 words. I am an American that lives in Japan and could relate to the characters the first time I came here, but this movie just never grabbed my attention. <BR>  We passed this around to our friends who had similiar reactions. The best quote was from one friend who gave it back and said, &quot;I'm sorry we didn't get to finish the movie, we had to go change our sock drawer.&quot;
B0000TB01Y|4.0|Stephen Schwartz has again proved that he can take staid material, twist it on its ear and create something new, innovative, fun, and memorable--he did with Godspell, Children of Eden, Working and now Wicked.  Idina is one of the most amazing voices on the planet and her &quot;Defying Gravity&quot; is one of the greatest act one closers in theatre history.  Kristin adds her unique spice and crystalline voice to the mix.  Some of the songs are a bit far reaching, but one can follow the characters, storyline and attitude of the production by simply listening.  If a score is meant to remind you of the show you've seen, then this is glorious...if it's meant to get you to NYC to see it, it succeeds on that level to.  A must own for even the not-so-serious theatre lover.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This is a really enjoyable, charming film, with great performaces from both lead actors.<BR>I have never seen Bill Murray act so subdued before, and it was refreshing.<BR>The story is slow, with not a huge amount happening, but don't let that put you off, because there is a lot of humour throughout, a lot of which is very subtle, and a lot of it is because of the Japanese / Anglo cultural differences.  (This film does not in any way ridicule the Japanese).<br />A charming, funny and well observed film which is really likeable.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|When I read the description of this movie, it didn't sound too interesting to me.  But when I heard it was up for best picture, I thought there must be something to it.  WRONG.  This was a terrible movie.  There was little if any story, none of it made any sense, it was full of scenes that had nothing to do with what was going on (i.e., Bill Murray staring at his razer, Scarlett Johannson sitting in the bathtub staring into space) and I never once felt the urge to find out how the story ended.  I am sure that is because there was no story to end.  I asked around and every person I found who had seen this movie felt the same way -- it's a dud.  I love Bill Murray as an actor, but there was simply no material in this movie and there was no interesting acting (except for maybe the one scene when he was making a commercial).  This movie was certainly not worth what I paid for it, and I doubt I would even recommend the $3.95 to rent it.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|First of all, I hope everyone agrees with me that this CD is one of the best live recordings ever! Rush has 5 CD's that are live and this one is the best. All The Worlds A Stage is their first one and you sure can tell. The material on it is older and doesn't have the fine tuning that their newer live stuff has. It just seems to be missing something. Exit Stage Left is much better as far as the quality of sound goes. I really like Exit Stage Left because, the songs chosen for this CD are from a time period where keyboards and synthesizers weren't used quite as much as in today's music. There certainly isn't anything wrong with using keyboards and synthesizers though. Some of Rush's best material has keyboards and synthesizers in it especially from the 2nd half of their career to present date. A Show Of Hands is a pretty good CD also but, not long enough. It left me wanting to hear more. Different Stages Live is an excellent choice for live music and is almost guaranteed to please having 39 songs on it that really rock! Rush In Rio is an excellent venue to record a live album at! This CD really kicks some butt!! I really think this is one of the best live recordings I personally have heard! I would give it an 8 1/2 on a scale of 1-10. Buy it! I don't think you will be disappointed.<BR>There just seems to be something about Rio that makes for a great CD. I hope you will enjoy!!
B000001EL7|5.0|This album is timeless and one of the best ever from the mighty Kiss!
B00005CDNJ|5.0|If Voulez Vous was their disco album, the followup, Super Trouper, a slang term for the giant spotlights used in their live shows and stadia, maintained a sound consistent with winning albums like their self-titled effort and Arrival, but with the energy of Voulez Vous.  The result is one of their best albums.<br />And it did give them two more UK #1 singles, making a total nine.  One is the title track, sung by Frida, about a singer who's going to be blinded by the giant spotlights on the stage of her concert, but won't mind, because somewhere out there, among the thousands of people, is her loved one.  &quot;Feeling like a number one?&quot;  Chartwise, definitely.  Its B-side is the galloping &quot;Elaine.&quot;  This was a B-side?  Should've been an A-side, as its frantic energy recalls other barnburners like &quot;So Long&quot; and &quot;Tiger.&quot;<br />The other #1 is the bittersweet &quot;The Winner Takes it All,&quot; a song inspired by Bjorn and Agnetha's divorce, but more about the pain of such a split-up.  The song veers from the couple's split to an analogy to the judges decision in some competition.  There's a biting sense of predestination, of one not being in control of one's destiny:  &quot;The gods may throw a dice/their minds as cold as ice/and someone way down there/loses someone dear.&quot;<br />The Top Ten single &quot;On And On And On&quot; with a mighty insistent stomping drums and synth rhythm, blaring synths, and an energy rivalling their previous albums.<br />&quot;Andante Andante&quot; is indeed an andante song.  In music, it means moderate tempo, faster than adagio, but slower than allegretto.  It makes a leisure slow-dance song, highlighted by the usual harmonies by the ladies.<br />With a fanfare like keyboard synth opening that continues throughout the song, &quot;Me and I&quot; explores the dual nature many people have, Jekyll/Hyde, and how normal it can be is encapsulated in the snappy chorus, &quot;We're like sun and rainy weather, sometimes we're a hit together/me and I/gloomy moods and inspiration, we're a funny combination/me and I.&quot;  And not to worry:  &quot;I don't think I'm different or in any way unique/think about yourself for a minute/and you'll find the answer to it/everyone's a freak.&quot;  One of the best songs here, and it's definitely allegretto allegretto.<br />Another andante andante song is &quot;Happy New Year&quot; and the group is definitely one for New Year's Resolutions and new starts, where the vision of &quot;a world where every neighbour is a friend.&quot;  The fact that it had just turned 1980, and how ABBA was a group of the 70's, makes Agnetha wonder &quot;what lies waiting down the line, in the end of 89.&quot;  Oh, if only they knew!<br />Frida sings in the wistful &quot;Our Last Summer,&quot; a personal song by Bjorn, the fond remembrance of a teenage summer in Paris during the Summer of Love, and how the feelings haven't changed years later.<br />I first heard &quot;Lay All Your Love On Me&quot; when the Information Society covered it on their first album.  After hearing the original, I detect a hint towards 80's techno in this song of how an initial meeting with someone yields possessiveness and jealousy on the part of the affected party.  The choir-like harmonies in the chorus give this song a kind of hallowed atmosphere.  One of my favourites here.  Definitely allegretto allegretto.<br />And now for an adagio adagio song, the Auld-Lang Syne atmosphere of &quot;The Way Old Friends Do,&quot; recorded live at Wembley Stadium, with the harmonies, orchestra, and synths reaching a heavenly pitch.  The farewell-type aura of this song seems to herald their imminent dissolution.<br />&quot;Put On Your White Sombrero,&quot; sung by Frida, was only put on the Thank You For The Music box set and finally here when Bjorn finally decided that it was actually a good song.  There are cowboy motifs in this goodbye song of someone who thinks life is a movie and rides offinto the sunset for some meeker senorita.<br />However, ABBA's penultimate album shows them still in top form, with stronger sounds, well-constructed songs and melodies, with little indication that their next album would be their last.  And it's official:  instead of Arrival, I deem this my favourite album by them.  It's super, troupers!into the sunset for some meeker senorita.<br />However, ABBA's penultimate album shows them still in top form, with stronger sounds, well-constructed songs and melodies, with little indication that their next album would be their last.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|If you dig The Hives, Bazooka Jones, The Vines and all the other garage rock heros that have been saving us from slodgy, depressing formula 'new rock' than you will really like this album. Sure, it may be the same 3 chords and some familiar formulas, but it has just enough spin on it to deserve serious attention. It's straight rock and roll, and lately that has been sounding so good. Fantastic vocals and raw guitar with plenty of space. Three thumbs up!
B00013PHGS|5.0|Air's new album is being described as the &quot;new&quot; Moon Safari, that so many of their listeners are relieved to have those easy listening and deep sounds back again. Though the Air albums to follow Moon Safari were quite different in sound and pure composition, Talkie Walkie is its own creation. Yes, it is fairly reminiscent of MS, but I always dislike hearing such things b/c a piece of art is created at a moment in time, and the feeling attained in one moment will never fully return; at best, there will be some residual elements that come back for a short holiday when creating something new. Talkie Walkie is great, just like anything Air does. The beauty of Air's music, and this is very apparent in Talkie Walkie, is the calamity and the calm; the obsession and the recovery. Air's preoccupation with space is utterly fascinating and will evolve with every album. There is loneliness, danger, despair, and the pleasure of discovery and rediscovery. Air is so very emotional and this album seems to be more so ... but I have no complaints. It is more than another Moon Safari, more than just another saunter through space.
0767830520|1.0|If I could I will not giving any star, it's an horrible movie.  Robert Deniro is terrible in it, he gets on my nerves, Cybil Shepard is annoying, only Jodie Foster seem fresh and interesting but we don't saw her much.  To much violence for nothing and awful cheezy music.  It was soooo boring.
B000002L75|5.0|I think this album is one of DM's finest. It has many strong melody lines and awesome lyrics, most by M.L. Gore. He's a genius... anyway, I'll roll off the tracks for you, and give my own personal rating for each.<BR>1.Something To Do - This song talks about boredom, and ironically is a great cure for boredom. I say bravo, 5/5.<BR>2.Lie To Me - A great song, perhaps the strongest on the album. It has a great percussion and bass line, and classic DM lyrics by Gahan. I say 5/5.<BR>3.People Are People - The first American single. Nothing else to say except that it could be less preachy, but it has a good percussion line. I say 4/5.<BR>4.It Doesn't Matter - Martin, you've done it again. This song is poetic, has great synthesized background music, and much more. I say 4/5.<BR>5.Stories of Old - This is a rocker! It seems to be kind of like &quot;Master and Servant&quot; in structure (maybe that's why I like it), and great lyrics by Gahan. I say 5/5.<BR>6.Somebody - Another piece of slow poetry by Gore, and while it may be a bit naive, it holds together with good sound effects. I say 4/5.<BR>7.Master and Servant - A song that is perhaps against indentured service? Message aside, this song is also classic DM. The high vocals by Gore: &quot;It's a lot!&quot; Gahan:&quot;Like life.&quot; I say 5/5.<BR>8.If You Want - Maybe Wilder should step aside and just let Gore write... I say 3/5.<BR>9.Blasphemous Rumours - I wonder why this song wasn't saved for &quot;Black Celebration.&quot; Anyway, a gloomy angst song about teenage suicide, but a really good percussion line. I say 4/5.<br />Well, that about sums it up: 39/45. Still a great album to own and get it now!
0385510438|5.0|After reading a number of other booklovers' reviews, I get the distinct impression that Grisham had durn well better write a thriller, or his biggest fans will be disappointed.<br />Not me.  I think the non-thriller-lawyer books he writes are better than the others.  There's just so many times you can bring out that tired old attorney-in-trouble recipe and make it work (see Clancy, King, Cornwell, etc., for examples of going to the well once too often).<br />If his books such as &quot;Skipping Christmas,&quot; &quot;Bleachers,&quot; and &quot;A Painted House&quot; had been released under another name, it would have kept his diehard fans happy.
B00005AWMF|5.0|Sade, as an artist can never go wrong. All her songs, whether they were released and became a \\"great hit\\" or were just tracks on her album, are all great in their own right. Sade has the most sexual husky yet feminin voice, she lures you into her music. Besides the sexuality in her music, she does sing with an important message like songs \\"Slave Song\\" on Lovers Rock. She is unique, and did something with her music, that no soul artist, r&b, or anyone for that matter has ever done. The originality makes her what she is. This album is one of the best greatest hits, because all the songs are easy to listen to. Thats mainly why she's so good, her music is easy and GOOD to listen to. \\"No Ordinary Love\\" is the best track on this album, but the entire album by far is respectable. You'd enjoy the listen.
B000000WCA|5.0|Easily the best pop album of the 90's, the music world was never the same again as soon as these 5 girls from England stomped onto the scene with their battle cry \\"I'll tell you what I want what I really really want!!\\"  And for the next 2.5 years they did just that--racking up 40 million album sales.  There are no fillers on this album.  Every song could've been a single.  It also shows the diversity of the Spice Girls (for which they have never been given proper credit for).  There's the over the top pop of Wannabe, the old-school disco funk of Who Do You Think You Are?, the pop/motown/R&B of Say You'll Be There (complete with harmonica solo a la Stevie Wonder!), the sexy jazziness of Naked, and of course the inevitable pop ballad Two Become One in which the girls advise their guy to \\"put it on...cause tonight is the night when two become one\\".  One of the best album covers as well!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|When the movie came out I wasn't interested in seeing it.  When it came out in DVD I still wasn't interested but I had a 99 cent rental coupon so I decided to give in to the hype and rent it.  Well, I should have listened to my inner voice.  I kept waiting for it to get interesting and just kept shaking my head trying to figure out why everyone liked it so much.  Weak plot, lackluster characters, mediocre acting.  Frankly I just didn't get it.  Rarely do I stop watching a movie midway through it but after I got to the part where they are singing karioke I couldn't take any more.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Before the show started airing I had seen the \\"Girl in a Box\\" ad campaign, and was vaguely intrigued. So, I watched the first aired episode (The Train Job) and spent the next several months trying to figure out what the heck the \\"Girl in a Box\\" was all about.  Turns out that the episodes were aired out of order.  But, after seeing the episode \\"Objects in Space\\" I was genuinely excited to see what would happen and then Fox canceled the show.  Well several months later I stumbled across the DVDs and I am completely hooked.  I spent one weekend watching episode after episode.  Since then I've rewatched the shows several times and I must say this is easily the best show that has been on television in years, honestly as long as I can remember.  I will be one of the first in line to get tickets for Serenity (the Firefly movie) when it comes out.  <P>If you like smartly written, intelligent story lines with an outstanding cast you are doing yourself a favor by buying this series.<P>In a word, Incredible!!
B00005JKC3|2.0|I so wanted to give this film a better review, because if nothing else, &quot;Hulk&quot; at least takes a more interesting than average approach to the comic-book-turned-into-summer-blockbuster genre.  Ang Lee gets kudos from me for his use of split screens to suggest the panels of a comic book, but that's about where my praise ends.  Because I usually like Lee, I'm giving this two stars instead of one, but I'm doing that under duress.<br />&quot;Hulk&quot; is dreadful. It's 140 minutes of nonsense, which might be o.k. if that nonsense had any notion that it was nonsense.  But Lee and company seem to take their material utterly seriously, which is deadly for this kind of film.  Lee uses the comic book look for his film, but he doesn't use the comic book tongue-in-cheek style of story-telling, so every single scene comes across as unintentionally silly.  Even with that, the film might have been enjoyable.  Hey, I enjoy a fun bad movie as much as the next guy.  But this is a fun bad movie without the fun.<br />The story takes forever to get going, and once it does it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway.  I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is one case where the story overwhelms the visuals.  I don't really need that much back story to the Hulk---what I want are cool action sequences and zingy special effects.  Well, the effects in this suck.  I almost have to believe the CG animation in this film was intentionally corny, otherwise the producers got seriously ripped off.  The only thing I can say about the animated Hulk is that he's a better actor than Eric Bana, who plays Bruce Banner.  Please don't ask this boy to act, and especially don't ask him to cry.  Jennifer Connelly is starting to really get on my nerves.  She's stealing the market on noble suffering away from Joan Allen.  But the real booby prize goes to Nick Nolte, who has driven another nail into the coffin of his career with his appearance in this.  He's absolutely putrid, chewing the scenery every chance he gets in a greasy fright wig.  His big showy soliloquy toward the end might have been more effective if the viewer could understand a word he says, but I doubt it.  Perhaps the filmmakers should have chosen to use a CG version of Nick Nolte instead of the real thing.<br />And darned if this movie doesn't suffer from action movie syndrome, complete with false finale and a real finale that is jaw-droppingly wretched.  $100 bucks to anyone who can make sense of what happens at the end, and who can also tell me how all of the people back at the military base were able to see the big battle between the Hulk and Nick Nolte as if they were watching it on screen as we are, even though they are miles away watching nothing more than a radar screen.<br />Bad, bad, bad.....<br />Grade: D-
0783225792|4.0|'Casino' is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen.  It is not for the soft-hearted.  Still good and in some ways better than 'Goodfellas'.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a film that was completely mismarketed. This is not a film, as the previews and original teaser suggested, about pure male testosterone being manifested in basement brawls. It is not a mindless-violence, action-hero flick used solely as a vehicle to show the washboard abs and chiseled man-waist of Brad Pitt. It is, actually, a film about the chaotic descent into madness and clarity by the main character. It is about the schism of personality that occurs not only with manic depressives or schizophrenics, but on a smaller scale with each and every one of us, every day, as we question our purpose, our reasons for fitting the mold when all we want to do is break free, and our intense and inward reactions to the immense pressures of culture and society. <br />This is not a film that exploits violence simply for the entertainment factor. It's a deeply funny, deeply thought film about the roots of violence, and the possible need for violence amongst the displaced men of today's culture. Suckled on advertising and inhabiting the soft life of corporations, how can the past hunters of society not be driven to make violence-or at least something that feels powerful-with their hands? It taps into the rage men feel at being promised and denied a spot as a demi-god in the culture simply because of their gender, and also taps into the hopelessness the younger generation feels at having been raised without our fathers. <br />Helena Bonham Carter is really the only woman in the film, but having a mostly male cast does not hurt this film for an intelligent female audience. So many of its components speak more directly to a generational frustration than any male-female dilemma, and the insights on the current male situation through this film are thought provoking regardless of gender. <br />I'm eternally glad I let myself be argued into seeing what I had already dismissed as a gratuitous smash-fest featuring the less-than-desirable Pitt (I call him \\"Pockmark\\"), as it now holdsstrong at #2 on my list of favorite movies of all time. David Fincher has created something truly stunning out of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, and the acting performances by all involved are hilarious, dynamic, utterly natural and completely absurd.

B00000IMTG|1.0|Just A note for the somewhat misguied US reviewer. While this album (CD these days) was released after Rainbow 'Rising', it came from the tour for the 'Rising' LP. It was definately prior to the release of 'Long Live Rock 'n' Roll'. The LP was originally to be a Japan only release, but bootleggers had already started taping all of the shows on the '76 Tour. It was released worldwide in an effort to &quot;Beat the boots&quot;. Other boots of this tour have mostly the same track listing as 'On Stage', but occasionally have more or less 'Rising' tracks on them, depending on which leg of the tour they were on. You also must remember that these years were also the &quot;jam-happy&quot; years at concerts. Deep Purple songs were also kept in for fans of that Blackmore era of  Purple. If you want a far more representative album of the tour try &quot;Live In Germany '76&quot;, which I tend to enjoy better than this LP(CD)... and they probably were smoking something!
B0000UJL96|5.0|Arguably the best of the six STAR TREK feature films sporting the entire original series cast, THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY is a well crafted tale of political intrigue that effectively bridges the gap between the original series and THE NEXT GENERATION.  In the capable hands of Nicholas Meyer, who also directed the second Trek feature THE WRATH OF KHAN, each of the cast members are given fuller, more important roles to play.  Not only that, but there is still plenty of room for other wonderful characterizations by such guest stars as Christopher Plummer, David Warner, and  Kim Cattrall!<br />Though some have expressed a desire to see the theatrical version of the film released on DVD, this edition contains the extended Director's Cut of the film.  There have been a  few very minor changes made to the film this time around though, making it the third version available to the public since its debut.  Three sequences have been altered, but  only one of them is actually noticeable to long time viewers of the film.  If you are uncertain as to what scenes have been altered, view the text commentary as it will explain what has been altered.  I think that the changes work quite well, being subtle enough not to make you suddenly realize that this is a different version of your favorite film!<br />As for the extras, Paramount has finally achieved the perfect balance of interesting material.  The useless space-filler documentaries of the past Trek special editions, several of which never seemed to pertain to the actual film in any way, are wisely avoided this time around.  Now we are presented with nicely detailed interviews and behind-the-scenes excerpts with director Meyer, writer Denny Martin Flynn,  as well as the rest of the cast and crew that really give some wonderful insight into the actual creation of the film, from the first idea to the final thoughts about the finished product.   <br />The best documentary on this set is the one made in tribute to the late DeForest Kelley, who endearingly portrayed Dr. Leonard McCoy.  Many clips from Kelley's long acting career are shown, much of which pre-dated STAR TREK, and it is fascinating viewing.  The documentary takes you right up through the last appearance of  his infamous character in the franchise (this film is the last time the venerable actor played the role of McCoy), as well as the last few days of his life.  This, as well as the interview with him made during the end of filming for this movie back in 1991, are the absolute highlights of the DVD.  DeForest Kelley will always be fondly remembered by fans and critics alike!<br />Other documentaries abound, such as a nifty tour of the props department.  \\"The Perils Of Peacemaking\\" is a very interesting piece that details the history of the Chernobyl disaster and how it directly influenced the idea and theme for this film.  There are interviews with each of the original cast members, as well as Iman (who plays the changeling \\"Martia\\"), where they answer questions and give their insights on the franchise.  There is even an interview with composer Cliff Eidelman, who created a very dark and haunting score for this particular entry in the series.  Also, storyboards highlight some alternate and deleted scenes of the film  that are not to be missed!<br />The commentaries are very good this time around.  The audio commentary is provided by both Meyer and  Denny Martin Flynn.  Meyer usually tends to pursue rabbit trails in his commentaries versus sticking with the actual film (a reason that I was not looking forward to this commentary), but coupled together with Flynn, they stay focused on the film and the creative process and development that went into it.  Overall, a surprisingly informative commentary that I really enjoyed.  The text commentary by Michael Okuda is what we have all come to expect, revealing lots of interesting facts and trivia about the cast, sets, and locations of the film.  Very well done as usual!<br />Surprisingly, thefact that this film was nominated for two Academy Awards, one for Best Make-Up and one for Best Sound Effects Editing, is never once mentioned anywhere in the documentaries nor is it commented on during the audio or text commentaries.  Oh well, at least you can see and hear for yourself just exactly why it received these well deserved nominations on this disc.  The picture quality is superb and the  new Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround mix is simply awesome.  Quite simply, the film has never looked or sounded better! <br />As fantastic of a job as Paramount did with this special edition release, I am somewhat baffled by the sloppy packaging of the actual set.  Though Paramount plans to stop packaging their DVDs with paper inserts, one has to wonder why they didn't at least include one here for the last of the original cast films.  Small nitpick to be sure, but still it would have made the set of six films universally alike.  More disturbingly, however, is the lack of quality control when it comes to ensuring that your discs are printed correctly.  To place a picture from a completely different movie on Disc 2 is one thing, but to print the words over the picture upside down is just plain ridiculous!  Even the interactive motion menus (which I always look forward to seeing) were a let down this time around.  The one on Disc 2 seems to be incomplete, basically taking you on the exact same journey regardless of the selection made.  It is ashamed that such a wonderful DVD full of great special features was sloppily packaged in such a rush to get it out on store shelves!<br />Overall, this is the best Trek DVD to be released to date.  I recommend it to anyone even remotely interested in the franchise.  Hopefully, the future releases will continue to either  maintain and/or  improve upon this level of quality, as well as avoiding any further un-needed packaging mistakes!
B00006FR47|5.0|I have made my feelings about Chicago V know to Chicago fans on many occasions. All I have to say about the DVD of this greatest of albums by a US-based rock band ever (from a creative standpoint, and a commercial standpoint - after all, it was a number one album in the summer of 1972) is that it is incredible.<br />Rhino had the foresight to make both the stereo version (like a CD) and the Dolby Digtial 5.1 Surround Sound version playable from any DVD player. I even got it to play surround out of a stereo that has parts that are 20-years old (but they still sound great!!!). I cannot guarantee it will do this on your system, but just being able to hook a modern DVD player up to an old system and being able to play surround sound is a credit to the folks at Rhino.<br />The stereo version sounds enhanced indeed, and I was quite surprised at its sound quality. However, when I switched it over to Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound, there was a world of difference. The extra sound separations brough out Saturday In The Park, Dialogue, While The City Sleeps, and all the other great album cuts on this recording in a way that I was thrilled by. I also appreciate the extra bonus cut of Dialogue.<br />The only thing I wish Rhino would have done (and this is a spectacular effort) is to include the same bonus cuts with this DVD as they did with the CD (the instrumental version of A Song For Richard And His Friends, for instance, and add the song at the end of the movie Chicago was involved in that year, &quot;Electra Glide In Blue&quot; - which hit the theaters the next year. That song is &quot;Tell Me&quot;, the brilliant Terry Kath tune. This song was also used on the last episode of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.
6305268843|5.0|Firelight is a stunningly beautiful film, a real work of the cinematic art, that is successful on many levels.  <br />The plot is compelling.  A young penniless girl accepts a deal to bear a child for a wealthy aristocrat in return for payment.  In the course of their \\"business deal\\" are sown the seeds of a potential relationship.  But this is nipped in the bud.  A child is born and duly handed over.<br />But the child acts as a magnet, drawing the mother in a search for her daughter, in her adopted role as governess.  And at last, she tracks down her daughter, and her erstwhile lover, to his estate, where he lives with his invalid wife.<br />Can she, in the role of governess, capture the love of her unruly and wayward daughter?  Can she live under the roof of her daughters father and maintain a distance?  <br />The central theme of the film is Desire.  How strong and what a terrible thing is desire, that can tear up families, ruin estates and cause good men to kill?  As universal a question as can be found.<br />All of this is the makings of a good film, but what elevates it to excellence are the cinematography and Sophie Marceau in the lead role.<br />In firelight, we are told, when the lamps are turned off, time stands still.  And when the lamps are lit, and time starts again, what occurred by firelight is not only forgotten, but is as though it never happened.  By firelight the film is all yellows, browns and reds, warm and passionate.  The rooms small and cosy, filled with life and light.   But in daylight all is blue and grey, stark and cold.  The rooms are large, cold and empty.   Charles comments \\"All these grand rooms and we live our lives within three feet of the fire\\".  By day the film moves with the pace of a Jane Austen or a Bronte novel.  It is reminiscent of Stanley Kubricks film of Barry Lyndon, austere, paced, measured, like Bach or Hayden.  By firelight everything softens and warms and relaxes.  All of this is achieved by the cinematography.<br />Marceau is now well know for her roles in Braveheart and The James Bond: World is Not Enough.  But this is a far more personal performance, more crafted.  And she is, if anything, more beautiful for being stilted in her environment.  She is the making of the film.  Stephen Dillane is excellent as her counterpart, but the low interest at the box office possibly had much to do with the fact that he is not the typical Mr Darcy character you would expect.  He is not tall, not dark and not handsome.  And yet, he is perfect in the role as the disapproving son of a spendthrift lord, the loyal husband of  a wife who is a vegetable, and the overindulgent father of a wayward daughter.<br />As films go, this is a class act.  A lesson to film makers, and a great movie to watch.  Don't forget your tissues!
B00000JLWW|3.0|Ok, great special effects, terrible doom for most of the crew and passengers in a Terminator fashion. Cameron worked so hard to show us he had a humanistic and artistic side. (he did all the drawing designs for Terminator, before Termintaor he was a sfx artist; it fits). However, like T2 and even T1 and Aliens, the sentimental and romantic bits come out too forced. It reminds me of Ang Lee who is good at making chick flicks but giving us too much soap opera in the Hulk. While Cameron is good at the action but tries to prove mostly unconvincingly and sometimes annoyingly <BR>that he can direct good characterization. As others have said, the movie I really enjoyed started when the Titanic hit the iceberg. The first part is an awful teenybopper soap with atrocious dialog , anachronisms and exaggerations of the actual event mainly to serve Leo's idol image, while the action part is a decent disaster film with Cameron's sfx and scenes of mass mayhem, with brilliance approaching The Poseidon Adventure. Though as usual in Cameron films, the heroes have seemingly more common sense and superhero bravery while the rest of the cast are sterotypical fools or cowards just like the characters in Aliens.
B00005NTN5|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, and being used to the standard offering where macho italian mobsters beat up on their dumb molls, it is a real breath of fresh air.<br />Jennifer Tilley oozes sexuality from the opening scene in this movie, and never stops right to the end.  She plays Violet, her character, brilliantly.  A mob club Vamp who is there as furniture for the boys, and they drool and fight over her, little realising her true nature.<br />Enter Gina Gershon, the butch ex-con called Corky, flaming obvious lesbian, replete with tattoos and leathers.  Boom!  Violet moves from Vamp to seductress in some of the hottest sex scenes ever filmed - gay or straight!<br />Having formed a sexually charged but shallow bond, the ladies embark on a plan to relieve the mob of a couple of million in blood money.  Violets significant other, Caesar (played brilliantly by Joe Pantoliano) is busy in the apartment laundering the money for the mob.  In a tongue in cheek parody, he actually has to launder the money, washing off the blood, haning it to dry, and ironing it.<br />In classic Hitchcock tradition, Violet and Corkey tell us exactly how the heist is going to go down.  And of course, it all goes horrible wrong.  Caesar is not as dumb as they thought, and the plot escalates into angst, madness, violence and murder with a neat Tarantino-esqe twist.<br />This is a great movie - Hitchcock meets Tarantino.  Lots of atmosphere and suspense, but also lots of laughs, not to mention mayhem and murder.  Not a movie for those who are squeamish around blood, murder, violence, lesbianism or drain clearence.  But highly recommended for those who love bondage, leather, tattoos, butch lady decorators and shiny stainless steel sink traps.
B00009Z574|4.0|Tormato nunca ha estado entre los discos favoritos de los Yesmaniacos. Sin embargo, al lado de lo que vendra despus: 90125, Big Generator, Union y Talk, ha de ser considerado casi una obra maestra. <BR>La inspiracin no fluye por los antiguos surcos de este disco. Es un poco como el &quot;and there where three&quot; de Genesis. Es lo mismo, pero sin ngel. Sin embargo, en esta edicin el nmero de temas extra supera al de temas originales y eso merece un comentario aparte. En primer lugar para los seguidores de Yes supone un festn de nuevos temas. En segundo lugar, muchos de ellos tienen ms calidad que los incluidos originalmente. Lo cierto es que tomado en su conjunto es una muy agradable adquisicin para cualquier aficionado al grupo.
0736041850|5.0|I was first given a copy of this book as a gift.  At the time I was recovering from an injury and looking for &quot;other&quot; ways to work the injured area.  Since that time I have had to replace it twice, as my daughter &quot;borrowed&quot; my first copy, as did my neighbor with the second copy.  I liked the book enough to replace it [twice] and would do so again.
B00009Z576|5.0|No entiendo como alguien puede criticar el que un disco ofrezca ms material. Si no te gusta, sencillamente, no escuches los temas extra y &quot;sin problemas&quot;. Pero es que, adems, en el caso concreto de Drama, los temas extra son del mximo inters, especialmente los cuatro que se incluyen de las olvidadas sesiones de Paris en 1979. De cualquier forma, nos encontramos ante el, para mi, ltimo gran disco de Yes. Tradicionalmente no se ha valorado suficientemente este disco por el hecho de suponer una especie de punto y aparte en lo que a la participacin de Jon Anderson en el grupo ha supuesto. Es verdad que no est Anderson, y eso se nota, pero a pesar de ello este disco, y las vas que en el se descubren son mucho ms interesantes que la zambullida en el &quot;heavy blando&quot; que supuso el siguiente: 90125. En este disco se conjugan perfectamente algunos de los mejores temas del Yes ms clsico con una apertura hacia mundos ms pop, sin que eso suponga una merma en la calidad de los temas, cosa que si ocurra, por desgracia, en buena parte de Tormato. Escuchando este disco con atencin, uno solo puede lamentar que quedara como &quot;botn de muestra&quot;, y no fuera el primero de una serie de discos con esta formacin. Lamentablemente, la incorporacin de Trevor Rabin sumi al grupo en la travesa del desierto que supusieron los aos 90. Tras los grandes discos de la mitad de los 70 que estn en la mente de todos, Drama es uno de sus ms interesantes experimentos.
B00008RH3L|1.0|I was expected a great movie because I usually like the Coen brothers but Miller's Crossing was just boring. Too much useless dialogues for not many action scenes.<BR>Not many outdoor scenes neither. Actors were okay but the story is simply not interesting enough.On the other hand, I liked the special features.
B00012QM9K|4.0|Back in January of 1994 my friend Ryan and I went to the AMC theater to see the new Steven Spielberg film Schindler's List. I knew nothing about this movie. I had no idea what the title referred to. I just new it was a Spielberg movie and with the exceptions of a couple of misses such as Hook and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, that name meant quality. So I picked up a box of Red Vines, took my seat next to Ryan and sat down and watched this movie. For the next three hours I sat in my seat and my eyes never left the screen. I felt shock, anger, sadness, and dread. I cried a few times. Heck, I even giggled a few times. But I was never bored. At the end of the movie as the lights turned on my Red Vines sat in my lap untouched. <br />Now ten years after winning the Academy Award for best picture Schindler's List is now available on DVD. The movie Schindler's List presents Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson, as a flawed man. Yes, he did save 1,100 Jews from death, but that is towards the end of the movie. During the first two thirds of the movie Schindler is seen as a man who is disloyal to his wife, bribes officials, and uses the tragedy with the Jewish people as a means of acquiring great wealth. Towards the end of World War II Schindler learns that the Jews are to be sent to Auschwitz to be exterminated. He devises a plan, with the help of his financial manager Itzhak Stern, played by Ben Kingsley, to purchase the Jews and save them from certain doom. <br />As the movie opens we learn that the Jews are being dumped into ghettoes. They are arriving at more than 10.000 a day. They are robbed of their property, they homes, and their dignity. Those Jews who are skilled laborers are spared as they can serve a purpose for the Germans. Those who do not, such as teachers and musicians, are more likely to perish. An hour into the movie there is a segment called The Liquidation of the Ghetto in which those Jews who serve no purpose are murdered. This is a long, tenseundertaking to watch. There have been a lot of movies in which there are long rampage scenes, but often the violence becomes repetitive and dull. This time each death is like a blow to the head. It's a horrible experience watching so many murders.<br />Ralph Fiennes plays Amon Goth, the head of the German SS. Fiennes plays the role of Goth on the right note. His steely eyes and calculating manner are a far cry from the Nazi's portrayed in the first and second Indiana Jones movies. In those movies the Nazi's were portrayed as comic book villains. This time Goth is played as a man who will kill another without hesitation for no other reason than he had no use for them. At times he kills for his own satisfaction. At other times he kills in what he believes is part of his job. There is a scene in which he complains about the mass killing as it means more work for him He is also a man of great contradiction. As much as he hates the Jews he falls in love with on. Watching him fall for his Jewish maid is horrifying. He wants to love her but at the same time he (In his twisted mind) feels she is subhuman. Unfortunately, the maid receives many beatings at his hands because he cannot contain his feelings for her. <br />This movie is pretty much flawless except for one detail. The movie focuses on Schindler and Goth but not on the Jews themselves. We get to know some by name, but we don't know of their lives before this tragedy took place. We know they are scared , they fighting for survival, and many of them keep hope alive. However, we don't know them. They are background characters. If you would like to see a similar movie that focuses on the lives of the Jews I would like to recommend The Pianist. Having said that Schindler's List is still one of the best movies ever made. I this movie 5 stars.<br />Now some remarks about the DVD. Universal decided to play it cheap this time and make this a single disc set as opposed to a two DVD set. That means Schindler's List is a flipper. Titanic is just as long and fits on a single disc side. The extras are really nothing to write home about. Now this comes in two versions. The disc buy itself and a $60 collectors edition. I wish I saved my money. It comes in a Plexiglas case for reason I have no idea. I guess if there is a freak earthquake in El Paso and all my DVD's are destroyed I'll still have Schindler's List. It also comes with the soundtrack (I could have bought both the no frills DVD and the soundtrack for about $35) and a book with a bunch of pictures. If you want this movie I suggest going with just the DVD and not the boxed set. I give the DVD of Schindler's List 3 stars.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is a great album, in short.  While it's not as good as Toxicity, one can overlook that cuz technically these songs were the &quot;rejects&quot; from it.  But theses songs are great, rejects or not.  While yes, System is a political band, and they do express their political views in this one (trust me), they're no Rage Against the Machine.  Also, most if not all of their songs have an inner meaning.  As a final note, Chic 'N Stu is about the  extenths to which advertisers will go to get people to buy their products (to the point where they need therapy).  So buy the album, or steal, either way, just enjoy Toxicity's brother.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I am helplessly getting closer to Josh Groban's voice. I have never heard something quite this enchanting. I didn't know a song could actually sound this good. A lot of people can sing, but Josh's voice resonates. \\"Oceano\\" and \\"Broken Vow\\" are so breathtaking because he takes his voice to another place and time. He gives each song the attention it deserves and doesn't disappoint.
0385504209|5.0|Awesome book!  Hard to put down.  Whether or not the theories are true, they are certainly interesting.  This book is a very entertaining read.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Think of Josh as the new flavor of ice cream at Baskin-Robbins that everyone is talking about. You've been dying to try it, but you decide to stick to your favorites. No room for a newbie because you're afraid that you might like it better. Besides, your friends will curse you and spit on your name if you even mention the words, \\"Tropical Surprise.\\" You're a Mint Chocolate Chip devotee (my favorite). Why would you ever want to try something else, right??? WRONG!!! I'll tell you why:<br />1. Tropical Surprise ain't goin' nowhere anytime soon. There are now unofficially 32 flavors. This flavor already has Tenure.<BR>2. Mint Chocolate Chip won't mind. They can never keep up with the demand anyways.<BR>3. If you like Tropical Surprise, you can look like a genius with your friends because you discovered a new and revolutionary flavor. They'll worship you forever.<BR>4. One scoop of Tropical Surprise will never be enough. Addiction is inevitable, and you'll enjoy every last spoonful.<BR>5. Ice cream has never tasted this good. The secret formula is guarded more heavily than Coke's.<BR>6. Tropical Surprise is a modern-day miracle. The Gods have truly blessed us this time.<BR>7. Well, seven is the day of rest. So, you get to spend all day enjoying it.<br />Okay, yes, this interpretation is a little wacky. But I though I would take a different approach. Hope you enjoyed it. I love Josh's new CD and this is the only way I know how to express my true feelings. Sorry if the review purists are offended.
B000066C1N|5.0|I saw the movie first.  Watched it on HBO Family.  Normally movies don't have an emotional effect on me, but this one just blew me away.  Who would have thought a &quot;G&quot; rated kids movie could do that!  I personally believe the credit goes to the incredible music.  Admittingly, I went and downloaded the songs from Gnutella immediately.  I was so impressed though, that I went and bought the entire soundtrack only a few days later.  I plan to buy the DVD when I get my next paycheck.  I've been listening to the music almost non-stop for the past several days now.  This really is awesome music!  My favorite songs would have to be (in order): You Can't Take Me, This Is Where I Belong, Sound The Bugle, uh.. sheesh, its so hard to pick a favorite order, I just play them all randomly.
B00005U8EM|5.0|I think one reviewer said it best: this is one of those rare films that has many levels --it's clever, it's comical, it's a love story.  It also challenges morality and delves into how we define human existence.  It makes you think AND feel.<br />Most of all, all these combinations work to create a unique and thoroughly enjoyable movie.  I wish these came along more often!
B00009RDG9|4.0|I recently picked this up cheap at the local Wal Mart.  It was one of those cop-type films of 2003 that I have been wanting to get.  So I was gleeful at the price...bargain bin deal if you know what I mean.<br />But anyway, this movie reminded me of cross between 1993's &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and ironically 1981's &quot;First Blood&quot; (Rambo I).  The Fugitive because of the cat and mouse game played between Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Torro, and First Blood because of the setting and &quot;hunting tactics&quot;.<br />The movie starts out with del Torro in the middle of a battle zone during the Kosovo conflict in 1999.  This was the most intense and realistic battle scene of this conflict I have ever seen on film.  Great special effects and tension.  You've got del Torro sneaking around, playing dead half the time, evading Serb soldiers to get to his final target, a Serbian commander who's ordering the shootings of every ethnic Albanian.  This scene is what finally made del Torro flip.<br />So del Torro is back in the states 5 years later and starts going on a killing spree, killing a group of hunters in the north west around Portland, OR.  It is then that we're introduced to Jone's character who was del Torro's killing instructor in the military.  So from here on out through the rest of the movie, we see a cat and mouse game between the two ranging from environs from the forest to a waterfall/river/damn, to the city streets and industrial complex.  It ends with an extremely bloody knife fight where both fighters end up near dead.<br />But anyway, the thing that really pulled me into the film was the great soundtrack.  Very powerful and emersive 5.1 surround track.  Especially the Kosovo battle.
0812550706|4.0|Ok, i know my review may be a bit biased, since i am a huge fantasy and sci-fi buff, but i still think this is a truly awesome book.  Ender is a very complex character to figure out, as he has many, many different sides to him, and the intricate weaving of the plot is phenomenal.  I can also relate to Ender, because i am also different from most kids my age (they consider me very bright, kind of like Ender, but i dont wanna brag), and I think he did a good job of coping with things the way he did.<br />The reason i only give it four stars is because i dont think it is necessary to have such crude language in this story (or some of the crude images of the goings-on in the barrackses).  Overall, however, i think this is a very good story that every sci-fi fan should read.
B00007G207|2.0|If this newer version of Cinema Paradiso were the original version of the story, it would probably rate as a mildly above average offering of Italian cinemia.  Worth seeing in the theater perhaps, but certainly not distinguished above the usual continental European fare of adult melodrama.  But as a &quot;director's cut&quot; of a magical masterpiece, this newer version is a huge hatchet job.  The term &quot;more than I wanted to know&quot; came to mind so many times.  This version force-feeds us so many details that ruin the mystery and magic of the original.  From Toto screwing the theater's resident prostitute, to his getting back together with his old flame later in life (with all of the cliched dilemmas of never being able to recapture the innocence of youth), to Alfredo's complicity in the deceipt that prevented their successful marriage early in life, all of the tawdry details that didn't need to get told get aired like so much dirty laundry.  The adolescent Toto doesn't even come across as convincingly heterosexual in this version.<br />I'm sure that many fans of the film will enjoy revisiting the world of Cinema Paradiso, and no doubt find many of the new revelations fascinating, and the extended time frame an indulgence. But who among us can honestly say that the understated magic of the original hasn't now been explained away, and that the innocence hasn't been tarnished beyond repair?  Now that we know all of the gritty details that got left on the cutting room floor, even the experience of watching the original has been sullied beyond repair.  Stay away from this version if you still want to watch the original with the same sense of wonder.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Ok, i have already written a review of this movie, but i really feel the need to at least try to talk some sense into the morons who say the movies are bad.  I must admit that i like the books better, but they are still some of the best movies that exist.  John Fumunda, i really think you need to just hit yourself over the head until you get some sense knocked into you.  The problem is not us, or Peter Jackson, its that you are writing a review taht sounds like the person who wrote it had an IQ of -2.  Sure, you can write a review with words six letters long, but you cant even recognize a quality movie when you see one.  You even understand some of the meanings behind it, and some of the biger picture, and you still dont appreciate it.  With all the trash thats out there these days, i cant see how you could not like the respite this gives you from the foolishness of Hollywood.  Im not just talking to him, either, im talking to all of you who were too senseless to see the genius of these films.  All any of you ever do is whine, so just give us a break and SHUT UP!
0061015725|5.0|If you're a fan of science fiction, you probably have some grasp of the so called &quot;difficult subject matter&quot;. Come on now, it's basic comp sci stuff and the rest is really not that hard. THE BOOK IS GREAT. suspenseful and gripping definitely. The science stuff is NECESSARY to grasp the full realization of the potential antagonistic consequences. But it's not like it's literally nuclear science published papers.. IF YOU DON&quot;T &quot;UNDERSTAND IT&quot; and that's what blocks you from enjoying this book then you're ignorant and you should stick to Cat In the Hat books...

0385510438|1.0|Grisham has definitely lost his edge! Where is the suspense? Where are the page turners we so eagerly awaited since &quot;The King of Torts&quot;? Were sick of reading about racism in the South in the 1970s, we want a book thats a gripping read like his earlier books. Quite a disappointment.
B00000IL1K|3.0|I am surprised that so many have given this album such positive reviews because it has one fatal flaw: the synthesizer mucking up about half the tracks.<br />Whatever in God's name possessed her, or her producers, to put that godawful synthesizer throughout the album. Here we have these great orchestral backgrounds, only to be mucked up by a cheesy sounding synthesizer.<br />I love her selection of songs, I love her voice, but I only wish she'd stop trying to be &quot;hip&quot; (although synthesizer sounds went out years ago, except for some New Agey crap) and just do some straightforward musical arrangements using traditional arrangements, with real drum tracks, not drum machines! (Actually I'm not sure they are drum machines, but if they aren't they sure tried to make them sound like they are!)<br />So anyway, I hope her forthcoming albums continue in the same vein of pop mixed with classical sounds, but without the synthesizer which only cheapens the overall sound quality!
B000056H24|5.0|I recently wrote a review on Jesus Of Nazareth. Shamefully though a pitiful review of a spectacular and wonderful mini series. I started off mentioning The Greatest Story Ever Told as the definitive Christ movie til I saw Jesus Of Nazareth. The truth is I love both these films with equal passion. I can't believe when I read people love one but revile the other.  Both of these shows offer intense drama, marvelous backdrops,  tear jerking moments, and a way of penetrating into the essence of your very being. But credit must be given where it is due. I find The Greatest Story Ever Told to be the superior DVD presentation. The bonus features disc is informative and entertaining. The Widescreen format is breathtaking. The Greatest Story Ever Told is a wonderful treasure to own.
B00014NE62|5.0|Maurice, based on E. M. Forster's posthumously published novel, was hardly the first homosexually oriented film to be released.  The Boys in the Band, Parting Glances and numerous telefilms had already been released.  But Maurice was the first film of any note--depicting homosexuality in a sympathetic light and with a happy ending to boot--to become a crossover success.<br />Set in the years 1909-1913, Maurice has been referred to as Forster's weakest novel, and there is justification in that label.  In the novel, Clive seems to have no clear motivation for his transformation from gay to straight, and he seems to become genuinely heterosexual following a trip to Greece.  The screenplay has improved on that by involving a secondary character in a homosexual scandal, which ruins his own life and frightens Clive.  Further, it's made clearer in the film that Clive's marriage is a loveless sham.  In this and several other respects, the film is a distinct improvement over the novel.  One cannot imagine Forster being unhappy with the changes the screenwriter made.<br />James Wilby realistically plays the title character, whose journey towards self-acceptance is the plot's main focus.  Wilby plays Maurice without a trace of affectation, as a homosexual who could easily pass for straight, but who has no patience for sham and rejects living a lie.  Hugh Grant as Clive--prissy, judgemental, and fearful--mirrors the sad tale of many a gay man who's stepped back into the closet.  But it's Rupert Graves' Scudder who remains in the mind long after viewing.  Graves manages to make the rough, uncouth gamekeeper sympathetic and even likeable (it doesn't hurt that Graves is very easy on the eyes).  The love scenes are handled with frankness, but without sensationalism.<br />Director James Ivory has a keen eye for camera placement (the memorable shots are too numerous to mention here), and draws natural, unforced performances from the cast-no easy task considering the formal dialogue.  The production, shot on a shoestring budget, looks impressively lavish-thanks to the excellent cinematography, costumes, and Richard Robbins' lush score (with its appropriate nod to Tchaikovsky).<br />Supervised by the Criterion Collection, the new transfer is a wonder to behold: very clean, with crisp, bold colors throughout.  The sound is also improved over the VHS and Laserdisc issues.  However, I noticed some audible camera noise during quiet scenes.  The bonus material is insightful without being overly flashy.  A few of the numerous deleted scenes-particularly Maurice's final speech to Clive--should probably have stayed in the film.ogue.

0684833395|2.0|Tao Lin's review is on the money.  Heller repeats himself over and over - sometimes entire paragraphs - and not as a stylistic choice but because he probably didn't know where the story was going.  No beginning, no middle, and no ending, just a long slog through pages of exposition with no real purpose.  The concept and title are catchy, but its all sizzle and no steak.  Not recommended, despite its &quot;classic&quot; description in most circles.
B000002JOH|4.0|Yes, there's good stuff on the \\"best of\\", and their other albums all rock as well, but this is THE essential Pantera album. It's their best, and one of the hardest and heaviest things I've ever heard, which is alot in 31 years. The title and the cover should tell you what you're getting into. Included is the pummeling \\"Mouth For War\\", \\"A New Level\\", \\"This Love\\", and the raging \\"[...] Hostile\\". The rest is just as crushing. By the time this is over, if you don't break or kill something it's amazing. This ranks with the best of \\"Ministry\\", \\"Metallica\\", and \\"Soundgarden\\". It's raw \\"Power\\"!

B00005OM4N|5.0|Britney is absolutly &quot;bombastic.&quot; This is truley one of Britney's better albums, and all of the songs are wonderful to listen too. This is Britney's 1st album that doesn't depend on 2 or 3 singles, instead it is &quot;complete.&quot; Since her previous releases, her voice has matured, but she still has that sound that made her a star. In my opinion, she has that kind of voice that's nice too listen to, because she doesn't belt out the notes, instead she sings her songs naturally and in a calming sort of way. My favourite songs on this album are &quot;I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman&quot;, &quot;Let Me Be&quot;,&quot;Bombastic Love&quot;,and &quot;Boys&quot;. However, their all great songs. <br />If you love this album, than you should get Britney's latest release &quot;In The Zone.&quot; It's even better then &quot;Britney&quot;, and shows how much she has matured over the past year. Also, this album truley expresses Britney's talent to date, and what she is capable of doing, and in the end Britney always comes out on top, even if her records didn't sell the &quot;expected amount.&quot;
B00005JMCN|5.0|This film is the true story of a little horse that inspired Depression-era Americans.  Ridden by a half-blind jockey, trained by an eccentric horse-whisperer type and owned by a marketing tycoon still in anguish over the death of his child, Seabiscuit brought these misfits together as he won race after race and challenged the nation's top horses.<br /><br />Based on Laura Hillenbrand's bestseller, the film is suitable for the whole family (though there are some fistfights and the off-screen death of a child).  This is an inspirational film by a fine writer-director, Gary Ross, who seems to come out with a terrific project every 5 years or so -- Big, Dave, Pleasantville and now Seabiscuit.  The cast is terrific -- Tobey Maguire, Chris Cooper, Jeff Bridges, William H. Macy, Elizabeth Banks and jockey Gary Steven in his film debut.<br /><br />DVD extras are great: a commentary track with writer-director Ross and Steven Soderbergh; a making-of featurette (15 min); on-set photos by Bridges; a featurette about the real Seabiscuit, featuring author Laura Hillenbrand (15 min); the featurette &#34;Anatomy of a Movie Moment; a Buick featurette (3 min); a soundtrack spot; bios and filmographies; very interesting production notes; dvd-rom features for Windows users; and, an unfortunate recent trend, a Mastercard spot.<br /><br />The film can be heard in English, and subtitled in English, French or Spanish.

B0001ADB8C|4.0|George Harrison Dark Horse Years 1976-1992 is an amazing collection however it is flawed so I have to agree with many of the reviews I've read it's a 50/50 split here. The remastered cd's are crisp and clean and George has never sounded better! A few friends of mine bought the boxed set so I'm familiar with what's there and what isin't. I opted to buy a few of the cd's individually, and build up the colection. I went with 33 1/3, the self titled George Harrison album from 1979, Cloud Nine And Live In Japan. However, there's more to the story. As a Beatles Historian and Harrison Expert, one has to remember that George was really at his peak at the start of his solo career. From All Things Must Pass (reissued and remastered in 2000) to The Concert For Bangladesh to Living in the Material World George was at his most confident, powerful and influential period and he would never recapture the glory of those years shortly after the breakup of the Beatles due to his dismay at the changes in pop music at the end of the Seventies. This is why the unincluded tracks and the botched dvd are so important. Another reason I strongly suggest buying the cd's individually is most are on sale at various retailers thru mid March. After the disastrous North American Tour of 1974 (George was hoarse and should have pushed back the tour a few months - I saw him in Chicago) George basically became a singles artist, releasing mediocre albums however the singles were very strong (some critics did applaud the 1974 shows, it must be noted however for the most part it went sour and a live album was never released)This is why the missing tracks on this new collection are so important! First of all, as stated above, the cd's are crisp and fresh, however as George did shine with some fine albums and various tracks later in his solo career (And george's fine guitar work cannot be questioned, especially his beautiful and exquisite slide guitar) the missing tracks make this boxed set extremely flawedand dissapointing. The Bonus tracks selected for each cd have little value and what about the 3 tracks  included on The Best Of Dark Horse 1976-1989 however not included here? This cd should have been included even at the risk of the other songs being redundant being available on the original albums. Of the 3, Cheerdown is an absolute must have! Or they could have been used as bonus tracks on the Cloud Nine cd. Remember, these 3 tracks were the only studio material George released around the time of the outstanding Cloud Nine album which takes us up to 1992.(With the exception of The Traveling Wilburys, but that's another story) What about the 4 missing tracks from Somewhere in England? And why were 2 tracks deleted from the Live in Japan double cd? I suppose they might be included as bonus tracks when Live in Japan is released on dvd, much the same as Sir Paul did with his 1993 live album: 2 tracks were left off the cd however included in the video and recently released dvd. We'll have to wait on that one. What about the tracks from Shangai Surprise? Some are outstanding and should have been included. The dvd is basically a teaser with only 4 live tracks from the December 1991 shows in Osaka and Tokyo and the promotional films are mostly from the 33 1/3 period although we do get the 2 versions of Got My Mind Se On You. What about Blow Away And All Those Years Ago? A very incomplete selection of George's promo films here. When I reviewed Beatles Anthology on dvd last year, in an open letter to Neil Aspinall at Apple I called for the release of The Beatles At Shea Stadium concert of August 15th, 1965 as well as the 1966 Shea Stadium concert and The Beatles Last show at Candlestick park held on August 29th, 1966. This show was also filmed and Apple/Capital has it in their vaults. I also called for the release of all The Beatles promtional films, at the risk of being redundant for the collection however there's 3 versions of Rain, 2 of Paperback Writer and 3 of HelloGoodby. Beatles Fans and Experts like myself want to see it all! So, in an Open Letter To Capital/Apple, Olivia and Dhani Harison I say Release All Of George's Material! Like the Beatles before him, as a growing, changing, progressive artist he went thru many periods and phases in his solo years and all should be made available to his millions of fans around the world! We need a rerelease of The Best Of Dark Horse 1976-1989 on cd, the Somewhere In England Tracks, the Shanghai Surprise tracks and a complete release on dvd of the 1991 Japan shows as well as All Of George's Promotional Films! Now Capital Records may be planning a Harrison Anthology and all this material may see the light of day. Surely, Capital is planing on reissueing George's solo Apple material covering Bangladesh 1971 thru Extra Texture 1975. My advice again: Buy the cd's individually and avoid the frustration I'm reading so many other Harrison fans are experienceing! Also, when we get a Boxed Set from another ex-Beatle, buy the material individually and build up your collection as I'm doing to avoid the frustration of missing material! As George told us All Those Years Ago: \\"With Every Mistake We Must Surely Be Learning..\\"  Enough Said!
B000002UB6|5.0|No less then 3 number 1 songs are on this album (Let it be,number 1 for 2 weeks,Get back,number 1 for 5 weeks, and Long and winding road number 1 for 2 weeks ),plus Across the universe and Two of us... top flight album all the way!
B00007G207|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is one of my favorite movies.  I finally found the new version available for rent through Netflix when I couldn't find it in any Blockbuster.<br />For those who have already seen Cinema Paradiso it needs no introduction.  For everybody else, it won the Academy Award for Foreign Language Film in 1989 and features one of the most nostalgic treatments of the role of movies in people's lives.  Ennio Morricone's theme song has also been recycled in countless commercials and movie montages and trailers.<br />What's good about the Director's Cut or &quot;New Version&quot; DVD is that one can view the director's cut with added scenes on one DVD side and the originally released version on the other.<br />For those of us who wanted some kind of closure to Toto and Elena's relationship, the Director's Cut has it-- there's about an hour more of footage of their relationship.  The new version also more footage of Toto's military service and his adulthood.  The added scenes somewhat mute the focus of the movie, so I could see why they were originally cut out.  But, at the same time, the added scenes fill in the blanks that originally made a lot of us think, &quot;Hey--  What about...?&quot;  And although Toto's childhood scenes are, as far as I can tell, unchanged from the original version, we also find out more about Alfredo.<br />After finishing the New Version I appreciated the original version better.  I highly recommend the new version not because it makes Cinema Paradiso more of a masterpiece, but because it adds more characterization to what, arguably, is a masterpiece.  The added scenes can be a bit superfluous, but they show how important editorial decisions are to shaping the structure and momentum of a movie.

0679892478|4.0|My son loved the \\"Ten Apples Up On Top\\" (Hardcover) book I borrowed for him from the library so much that I ordered a copy of our own. Thinking that the board book would be more sturdy, that's what I ordered. Never imagined that the board book could be only less than half of the full version, you can imagine the surprise and disappointement we had when we sat down to read it together. Now I know to compare the number of pages when I order. I wish there were some kind of clearer indication and warning about Board book version not being the full version somewhere in the Product Description.
B00006FDCD|5.0|The DVD itself is just average. For a TV mini series, I'd say we're lucky to even get a commentary track. The good news is that this DVD has nothing cut out unlike the edited VHS version we have in Australia. The scenes that was missing in the Australian VHS version is where Henry escapes from Juniper Hills (where Pennywise's head turns into a dog's head), also a long discussion where the adult loser's club is talking about how the whole town is &quot;IT&quot;. Other than that there were also some scenes that ended before the music had stopped or screen had faded but luckily the DVD has all of the proper footage.<br />The picture and sound quality is decent throughout the entire disc. The region 4 DVD is double-sided so it has part 1 of &quot;IT&quot; on one side of the disc and to watch part 2 of &quot;IT&quot; you have to flip the disc over (I'm assuming this is the same as the region 1 version). I'm not really too fond of double-sided DVD's as they're easier to scratch and such but I'm just telling you this in case you'd rather avoid them and such.<br />Fans of &quot;IT&quot; shall enjoy the DVD.

0553208845|1.0|Having read Hesse's &quot;Demian&quot;, I knew full well I would absolutely despise this novel if and when I read it. However, I could not have predicted the extent to which I would hate it. Often considered a literary classic, I half expected to find at least one redeeming quality within this novel's pages. I was mistaken. Hesse's contrived anecdote does nothing to justify the worldview contained, in that sense being very similar to &quot;Demian&quot;. The concepts regarding the searching of the soul are abstract and only appeal to emotion or repressed desires, as opposed to intellect - the novel offers no practical or applicable consul or theme. Perhaps, I am simply unable to understand the novel's &quot;Eastern&quot; context, but I would suppose I am at least as familiar with it as a middle-aged, reclusive German author from the middle of the 20th century. The novel demands empathy from the reader with the protagonist's soul searching in order to be successful or have impact - a quality I don't consider indicative of good literature. Moreso, Hesse's style seems elementary, akin to a young adult novel, though such may be a result of the translation. Even so, when compared to his contemporaries of the era, I fail to understand how Hesse's &quot;Siddhartha&quot; can be so revered - failing dreadfully in comparison to the works of J.R.R. Tolkein, C.S. Lewis, George Orwell, Joseph Heller or William Golding. To conclude, I do not recommend this novel as a classic or ground-breaking revelation in any sense. Perhaps, I had expected too much. Many other authors, not the least of which include the aforementioned, have related the path of maturity of the individual in much more impactful and meaningful literary works than Hesse, and therefore, the redeeming qualities of &quot;Siddhartha&quot; are diminished, if not non-existant. Honestly, I would like to meet someone who genuinely likes this novel and finds it valuable in order to discover its worth. Insofar as I see it, there is none.ere is none.
B00003CY6M|2.0|...this movie about fate, destiny and whathaveyou falls on its head.<br />Like a countless other missed romantic &quot;comedies&quot;, it tries to capitalize on the idea of two people searching for each other, only to find each other in the last moments of the film. Sadly, it fails on the most basic level to entertain, leaving the viewer with nothing but a more-than-mild case of hatred for the protagonists and a sick feeling in their stomachs.<br />The characters never make it to more than shallow and self-centered, willing to mislead their fiancee's, lie, even cheat, for just one chance to have, not just happiness, but ultimate happiness. The humor is never quite funny. The acting looks like, well, acting. The situations are so implausible they're almost idiotic.<br />If these characters had shown any honesty, any decency towards the jilted parties, perhaps it would have been a different movie. Instead the characters seem to go out of their way to pile lie upon lie, deception upon deception. Cusack, who lent a soulless contract killer likability in Grosse Point Blank, is surprisingly flat here.<br />The soundtrack is pretty neat though, but otherwise a fairly bland flop.
B0000CFW87|5.0|After falling in love with Groban's voice and savoring his first CD as well as his live concert CD, I ordered &quot;Closer&quot; long before it was released.  I wasn't disappointed.  This CD has been in my car's CD player for almost four months straight now.  I tried to find translations for the italian, spanish, and french songs, and even went to some websites that do translation for you...  no luck.  Nothing made sense.  Lack of the english translations was the only complaint I have about this CD.  Otherwise, this CD is EXCELLENT!  Can't wait to see him in concert in Palm Beach in April!

I find myself needing to withdraw during busy days to any place where I can have some privacy and relief from stimulation.<br />2. I am easily overwhelmed by things such as bright lights, strong smells, coarse fabrics, or sirens close by.<br />3. I get rattled when I have a lot to do in a short amount of time.<br />4. I startle easily.<br />5. I make it a point to avoid violent movies or TV shows.<br />6. Changes in my life shake me up.<br />7. When I must compete or be observed while performing a task, I become so nervous and shaky that I do much worse than I would otherwise.<br />8. I am very conscientious.<br />9. When I was a child, my parents or teachers seemed to see me as sensitive or shy.<br />10. I tend to be very sensitive to pain.<br /><br />If you answered true to five or more of these statements or if any one or two statements are extremely true of you, then this book may be for you.<br /><br />This easy-to-read, non-technical book (first published in 1996) by Dr. Elaine Aron, deals with the highly sensitive person (of which Aron is one).  Such a person is one that has a very sensitive nervous system and thus has a trait of greater receptivity to stimulation that may cause over stimulation.  This trait should not be confused with such things as introversion, shyness, inhibition, anxiety, or fear.  (Interestingly, there are also extroverted highly sensitive people.)<br /><br />This book provides basic, detailed information about this trait, data that is difficult to obtain elsewhere.  According to the author, \\"[This book] is the product of five years of research, in-depth interviews, clinical experience, courses, and individual consultations with hundreds of highly sensitive persons.\\"<br /><br />If you feel that you are a highly sensitive person, this book will help you understand yourself better and show you how to thrive in today's not-so-sensitive world.  Also, this book is written for those seeking to understand those that are highly sensitive, such as a friend, relative, employer, or educator.<br /><br />This book consists of ten chapters:<br /><br />*Chapter one helps one learn the basic facts about this trait and how it makes one different (not flawed) from others.<br />*Chapter two helps you understand your trait.<br />*In the third chapter, you'll learn to appreciate your highly sensitive body's needs.<br />*In the fourth chapter, you'll learn ways to rethink your past experiences in a positive light and gain greater self-esteem in the process.<br />*Chapter five gives insight of how high sensitivity affects non-intimate social relationships.<br />*Chapter six gives insight of how high sensitivity affects work relationships.<br />*In the seventh chapter, you'll find insight of how high sensitivity affects close intimate relationships.<br />*The eighth chapter deals with ways to heal the sometimes deep adult psychological wounds caused when one was a highly sensitive child or adolescent.<br />*Chapter nine gives information on medications and when to seek help. (The author advocates caution if you desire to use medication.)<br />*In the last chapter, you are introduced to techniques to enrich the soul and spirit.<br /><br />Near the beginning of this book is a self-test to help you decide if you are highly sensitive.  It consists of twenty-three statements (ten selected ones are presented above) of which you answer true or false.  (I felt that some of these statements were too general.)<br /><br />Throughout this book are voluntary activities that the author has found useful for highly sensitive people.  As well, there are tips throughout on how to deal with over arousal.<br /><br />Finally, there are three appendices that consist of tips for health-care providers, teachers, and employers who work with or employ highly sensitive people.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are highly sensitive or want to learn about this trait, then this is the groundbreaking book for you!!<br /><br />+++++t this trait, then this is the groundbreaking book for you!!<br /><br />+++++
B00002E233|4.0|People...this movie is entertainment only and it succeeds on almost all accounts. Sure some of the shark effects are a little cartoony, but over half of the shots look decent and the robotic sharks are the best ever put to film. Any movie that combines huge amounts of suspense and action, while managing to make even LL Cool J funny is a good thing. Rent or buy it cheap ($10 bucks at most stores!), because you don't need to think to have fun.

I think Dennis Lehane is tops in his genre and love reading him.  &quot;Shutter Island&quot; was a little disappointing in that I have trouble believing a psychiatric facility would go to such intricate lengths to bring a patient out of their psychosis. But then, this is fiction.<br />Other than that, the read is great.  As always, Lehane does not disappoint with his characterizations.  He's a wonderful writer and one I will always read.
B00004YA66|5.0|I found this movie absolutely amazing.  When it came out I don't think it recieved the audience it deserved, but after hearing how good it was I searched it out, as everyone should.  This movie is so well woven, not just a mystery, not just a story of a father connecting with a son, but all this and much more, done in a beautiful, un-campy way.  I would not consider this a &quot;time travel&quot; movie, but quite differently one of hope.  Of a man just wishing for a bit more time with his parents, a man searching for some kind of happiness in his life.  Well scripted, well acted, and complete, I highly recommend this movie.<br />What bothers me is that some reviewers on this page have expressed bluntly that they will not see this film because of the recent role Jim Caviezel has portrayed in the film &quot;The Passion of the Christ.&quot;  Certainly everyone is entitled to their opinions.  But my heart goes out to these individuals, that they would be so quick to shun, and even criticize a film such as &quot;Frequency,&quot; a film that they have not seen, and would miss out on just because they cannot separate the actor from the role.  And to say that Jim Caviezel would bring &quot;an evil&quot; (as one reviewer explicitly states) to this film makes me sudder at the closed-mindedness one could posses.  I'm not here to address &quot;The Passion of the Christ,&quot; but I will say that by judging blindly, one can miss out on great experiences.
B00005JLT5|5.0|THE PIANIST is a powerful film by famed Jewish director Roman Polanski, who won a Best director Oscar, as well as star Adrien Brody, who won Best Actor playing Wlady Szphilman, a real-life world-renown pianist<br />The movie is set in World War II Nazi-occupied Poland. Szpilman is a Jewish pianist, and survived miraculously in the ghettos hiding from the Germans and eluding Nazi death camps. Unlike many unfortunate Jews, Szpilman is lucky to have survived.<br />THE PIANIST is an absolutely great piece of work; Polanski does a startling job at building such an epic war film at such a grand scale, and also a builds a sad and emontional tone as well. Brody also did a magnificent job potraying Szpilman, and I think he richly deserved that Oscar.<br />One of the greatest Holocaust films ever made!
B000067CPX|4.0|Dont get me wrong, RHCP are my favorite band of all time. I love most of the songs on this album. The reason i didn't rate 5 stars is because it really needed some more harder songs. Songs like By the Way, Can't Stop, Minor Thing, Throw away your television. I also loved the ballads, Venice Queen, Zephyr Song, Midnight, I could die for you. But sometimes it just gets to slow to a weird point. Songs like Dosed, Don't Forget Me, Warm Tape. Their just plain boring. Someone reviewed 1 star earlier saying the drumming and the musicianship suck. If you were a musician you would realize the simple beats that Chad Smith produces show his true musicianship. Their not overpowering any instrument and are doing what they are supposed to- laying the beat, being the engine behind the music. Also, if you watch their live DVDS, especially Off the Map, you can see what Chad is really capable of, its some crazy stuff. Also, as for John, Flea, and Anthony, they are some of the best musicians in their categories. John produces beautiful songs when needed and i love his solos (their not frenetic and are just really cool such as in Californication). He can also produce funky/heavier stuff as in give it away and the funky lucks off of BSSM, Mother's Milk, self-title, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, etc. Flea is one of the best bass players ever. If you listen to their older music or watch them live, Flea is amazing. He can slap, pop, strum, and do virtually anything on the bass with extreme talent. Watch Off the Map. Personally, i think Anthony Kiedis has one of the best voices in Rock today. He can rap (BSSM, Uplift Mofo Party Plan, Freaky Styley, etc.), sing harder songs (give it away), and sing beautiful ballads (Under the Bridge, Soul to Squeeze, Gong Li, Zephyr Song, etc.)Anyways, heres a song by song rating<BR>By the Way- Fast and funky, cool bass line. very random lyrics 10/10<BR>Universally Speaking- ok... kinda boring sometimes... 7/10<BR>This is The Place- catchy, cool chorus. Still, lyrics make no sense- 9.5/10<BR>Dosed- Too boring... 6/10<BR>Don't Forget Me- Its ok, I like the back-up vocals by John. Kinda repetitive 8/10<BR>Zephyr Song- beautiful song, love the guitar, vocals, etc. 10/10<BR>Can't Stop- Funkiest track on CD, very cool guitar/bass riff, vocals too. Weird lyrics (J. Butterfly is in the treetop<BR>Birds that blow the meaning into bebop? what the hell???)10/10<BR>I could die for you- cool ballad, love vocals and guitar 9/10<BR>Midnight- Kinda experimental i guess with the strings and effects. seemed to work out well. Good chorus. 9.5/10<BR>Throw Away your Television- Cool bass line, pointless lyrics... the usual. 10/10<BR>Cabron- Love the guitar, a bit repetitive. Lyrics make sense! 9.5/10<BR>Tear- A bit boring, but overall good song. 8/10<BR>On Mercury- faster paced song, pretty good, usually skip it though.. dunno why. 8/10<BR>Minor Thing- One of my favorites, good vocals, he kind of raps a little... a little... cool guitar too 10/10<BR>Warm Tape- very strange, if it was experimental, i suggest they don't do any like it again. too weird. 3/10<BR>Venice Queen- Very good ender, starts out slow with a cool guitar riff, then gets faster with an acoustic guitar. Awesome song and vocals. 10/10<br />I know i said alot of the lyrics are pointless, maybe they have meaning so don't bash me for saying that, but to the casual listener they don't make sense unless your research the meaning behind them. Anyways, overall a great CD, go out and buy it if your an alternative/Chili Peppers fan!
B0000VAFO0|4.0|I was really impressed with this movie because,as other people have noted, it was one of the few good vampire movies to come out of over 15 or more produced in the past decade.  I have always been enthatuated with vampire films, especially when they are placed in a modern setting and given an awsome enemy to fight, like say... werewolves.  Great storyline and sweet effects, this movie kept me wanting to see what the hell was going down the entire time.  It has a very Blade like feel, as well as a bit of the Matrix (all that leather) but neither of these is a bad thing as the film still feels unique.  It is a great film and definately one to buy for any action/sci-fi fan.
0395925037|5.0|i find this book the best book i have ever read, i think it includes some fasinating points and lines. I would reccomend it anyone who is open-minded and is prepared to let there \\"anti-racist, hate hitler\\" views go out of the window while you read it. Forget who it was written by for a minute if u dissaprove of the man and you will come to realise wat i mean.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|Hey This ia a damn good album maybe not the greatest in the band's mighty arsenal but it's right up there with some of the best , anyway The top three tunes on this one are &quot;Wickerman&quot; , &quot;Ghost of Navaigators&quot; which makes a great 1-2 punch to open the album and then &quot;Dream of Mirrors&quot; another awesome track it's long but holds you're intrest all the way through especially the chorus . In short any hard rock/metal fan should pick this up , even if you aren't that familar with Maiden .
B0000CEB4V|5.0|As a baby boomer who loved the Beatles and George Harrison, especially his &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; album, I nearly fell off my bed while watching the &quot;Concert for George&quot; on PBS one Wednesday night in early March 2004.  Being from Maui, Hawaii, where he was spotted every now and then at the Sir Wilfreds' Cafe at the Maui Mall, where he took part-time residence and played a very low profile in the community, I felt especially connected to the Indian spiritual sounds of the transcendental music on this performance composed by Ravi Shankar.  Eric Clapton and friends organized a beautiful gift for their beloved friend.  Heartfelt performances, interviews and dialogue in the extras on the DVD encapsulate what transpired that evening of November 29, 2002 at the Royal Albert Hall, London.  If I had known about this concert, I would have post-poned my trip to London in the March of 2002 to attend this once in a life time Concert for George.<BR>Aloha &amp; Mahalo George.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|If you liked the 1st and 2nd parts, then The Matrix Revolutions is a must see follow-up to them both.  The ending, however, was a little bit dissapointing.  It didn't really explain too much and it just kind of finished when there could have been more.  Apart from the lacking storyline, the movie's budget was well spent on a frenzy of digital special effects and a great cast to back it up.  The fighting scenes are awesome and almost makes up for what should have been an amazing trilogy.  The bottom line is that Revolutions wasn't as impressive as the 1st or even the 2nd movie.  I guess we've seen it all before, but the fact remains that it is an ending and no story is complete without one of these!  Definitley worth a watch, but don't expect too much.
B00008MZ0O|5.0|i loved this movie i am going to go right out and buy a 1989 cheverolet comaro ss . i will tune it up with stuff like noz.<BR>it is going to wheelie like dom's charger. my favorite car in the movie is the black honda civics. well i was getting of topic this movie is very good they hijack trucks. they al;so drag race a lot. i love this movie and its followeup 2fast2furious.
B00013F38K|4.0|I now have the DVD boxset, and have done a direct comparison with an old recording on VHS, and yes the DVD is cropped slightly at the top, and bottom when compared with the VHS recording.<BR>However it really does not matter as the picture quality in the 30 minutes I have watched so far more than makes up for it. Having read the concerns about it being presented in widescreen I was not sure if I should go ahead and purchase it. I'm glad now that I did, the picture issue really does not matter, if you enjoyed the series you will enjoy the DVD's from what I can tell. <BR>The memories of the fights at school the day after each episode was broadcast will come flooding back.
B00012QM8G|2.0|Everyone already knows how great and critically acclaimed this film  is so this is a review of the DVD. This will probably go down as one of the biggest let-downs (for me) in DVD anticipations. Sure you have the widescreen version with great sound on DVD, but thats it. For People who already have the VHS versions, you pay more money for a little better picture and sound and you get cheated on features. Instead of a great commentary or documentary you get more preachy propaganda Spielburg dumped onto the second side of the disc. I have a feeling that Spielburg wanted the film to be the highlight of the  DVD and not the extras, but in my opinion, extras never hurt...especially if your going to price it like it has tons of extras on it. If you want to be emotionally, or spiritually moved watch the movie, you don't really need to see the lousy extras. My advice is to only buy the widescreen DVD verion if you don't already have it in VHS.
B0000TLA9G|1.0|Most bands who release a greatest hits album will have enough common sense to include one or two new tracks so that their most devoted fans aren't just buying songs they already own. <br />It just looks like this greatest hits cd was put together in about five minutes, even the cover art isn't very imaginative. <br />If you're new to Guns N' Roses then this greatest hits collection will be a good introduction to their music but if like me you own all these songs already then save your money till Chinese Democracy finally gets released.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Mark another film off the \\"why isn't this on DVD yet?\\" list.  Spielberg's masterfully told tale of how German Oskar Schindler saved Jews from the concentration camps by employing them in his bogus crockery and munitions factory is moving, stirring, and any other superlative adjective you can think of.  Although brutally graphic at times, the film accurately portrays both Jewish passivity and Nazi aggression and leaves the viewer with more questions than answers about how the world could stand idly by while the Holocaust happened.<br />The thing I enjoyed most about the film was the subtext of power and the juxtaposition of Neeson's Schindler against Ralph Fiennes' Amon Goethe. Both men use their power to very different ends, and there are some classic cinematic moments when Neeson explains the nature of power to Fiennes.  <br />I often used segments of the film during my public speaking classes to demonstrate the point that rhetoric is a tool that can be used for good or evil.  There are examples in the film of both--Goethe using the power of communication for evil, and Schindler using it for good.<br />The film, of course, won Best Picture in 1993, and who couild blame the Academy.  Schindler's list left an indelible mark on the minds of many, and that was precisely Speilberg's point.  As the sign outside of Auschwitz reads, \\"never forget.\\"  Thankfully, this iconic film is now on DVD for us to watch again and again and keep the memory of the Holocaust alive for future generations.
0767821629|5.0|Why do people keep saying this is a MATRIX ripoff? This movie is based on the novel SIMULCRON-3 that was written in 1962!!<br />I think that predates the MATRIX by a few years. Plus, the MATRIX isn't all that original anyway as even communicated by the screen-writers. Can you say PKD?
B0000399WI|5.0|At his worst, Stephen King is a horror hack who turns ordinary objects into supernatural killers that terrorize New England towns crammed with people with dirty little secrets.  At his best, King writes stories like Shawshank and Green Mile, stories that create memorable characters whose humanity is more of the focus than the supernatural.  Not that I haven't read plenty of both types from Mr. King, but this happens to be one of my favorites.  <br />Derived from a short story in King's &quot;Different Seasons&quot; collection (which also contains &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;The Body&quot; which were adapted into the movies &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; and &quot;Stand By Me&quot;), Shawshank is one of the few cases where I can say that the movie was actually slightly better than its print predecessor.  Although I enjoyed the short story thoroughly, it is only a novella, and the movie adds significant breadth and depth that are lacking in King's narrative, as well as making the story more linear and chronological.  By making it less anecdotal, the story is much more cohesive, and Robbins' character arc is much more complete.  <br />Sadly, TNT has seized the rights to the film as a &quot;new classic&quot; and plays it ad nauseum, but it is well worth owning the unedited version on DVD.   Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins' acting is understated and subtle, and the supporting cast is impressive.  Shawshank is one of those rare films where everything just clicks perfectly, and all of the seemingly disparate pieces fit perfectly together to leave the viewer feeling as redeemed as the main character.

B00005JLD4|5.0|There is probably nothing I can say about the Movie itself that hasn't already said - engaging, sad, inspiring, entertaining and beautiful.<br />What I particularly loved about this DVD was the \\"Special Features\\" documentary \\"Following Rabbit-Proof Fence\\" that showed the process the director and his team went through traveling by small plane across much of Australia and landing in small towns to have quick interviews with dozens of 8 - 12 year old Aboriginal girls.<br />The selection process of three young girls without any acting experience was shown, then their accelerated training as actors and finally the emotional filming of the movie itself.<br />While the movie itself is \\"5 Stars\\" the addition of this documentary to the DVD makes the whole experience 5+ stars.
B000063DFN|5.0|It is no wonder that Powerslave is considered by many to be Maiden's greatest album as it contains 4 of Maiden's classics and overall is worthy of being called a masterpiece.<br />Aces High - 10/10<BR>2 Minutes to Midnight - 9/10<BR>Lobsfer Words (Big 'Orra) - 8.5/10<BR>Flash of the Blade - 8.5/10<BR>The Duelists - 7/10<BR>Back in the Village - 8/10<BR>Powerslave - 9/10<BR>Rime of the Ancient Mariner - 10/10<br />I highly recommend buying this album.  For new Maiden fans I'd put it second to Number of the Beast as the best album to start off with.
1565117808|5.0|I wanted to read this book for while but never got to it. So I decided to listen to it. The audio certainly did a great job in telling an already great story.<br />The narration was simply captivating, especially the indian accent for Pi! The story just comes alive. It painted an even more vivid picture in my mind then if I were to read it.
B00005Y7L4|4.0|An interesting film. Once I was able to accept the outlandish premise as merely hypothetical (How much more far-fetched can you get?), I became hooked. A very chilling concept, which lends to one of the most intense movies I've ever seen. But whoever compares this film's director to John Woo, simply doesn't know John Woo. Woo is a stylish director, the master of fancy gunplay. Without him, there would be know Matrix, no Max Payne, nor a number of other Woo-inspired monuments to gunplay. (However, if no Matrix would mean no Matrix 2 or 3, then perhaps it would all be a worthy sacrifice.) <br />This film's director seems to have foregone style (that is if he had the ability, as not all directors are cut out to be action directors), but kept the insane gore for which Japanese cinema is known. <br />Of course, that might be a good thing. The violence is horrifying; hard to watch at times. Yet, had this film been filled with fast, slick, cool diving and shooting moves, it may have lost what hard-to-find credibility it boasts as it is. And when I say &quot;hard-to-find,&quot; that is not to degrade the film's quality. Like I said, I had to accept the premise as purely hypothetical. Not many other viewers will show that same willingness.<br />Overall, I loved the movie. It's definitely worth the effort of seaking out.<BR>(Oh, and if anyone complains about the movie lacking character development, show some consideration. There are 42 of them.)
B0000A1WGH|5.0|While in Europe this pass summer, I saw a gem of a movie being GOODBYE LENIN.  Finally it is coming to North America.  Already enjoying the work of Yann Tiersen from the French Hit Le Fabuleux Destin d'Amlie Poulain, you will love the music to this movie!
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown is more than an excellent writer, who fully develops his characters' personalities, which by the way is not boring!<br />Nor is his detailed descriptions of historical information.  If you are bored by this or any of his other books, you  either already know everything there is to know, are unimaginative and unwilling to learn about new ideas.  Enjoy the book for what is it - a fascinating murder mystery in a unique setting that includes both fact and fiction.  I recommend all Dan Brown's books as I learned some wonderfully interesting technology, political ideology, and even computer programming from them.  The excitement never stops and once you've started it you'll have to read all the way to end non-stop!!

0684800713|5.0|Now, I love Hemingway. What I've read of him has been great, but I found The Sun Also Rises to be a wondrous experience while reading it (as I did The Complete Short Stories). Perhaps I should have waited before writing this review as I am still struck dumb by the sparse beauty of Hemingway's prose. This is a tender, absorbing, gripping story of a group of American and British expatriats and their vacation in Spain for the bullfights and festivals. This has become one of my favorite books.
1573229725|2.0|Although the writer's craft is well done, with some surprising twists to the plot,overall the book was dull. The characters are all low life petty thieves, who have no honor even among themselves.  By the end, I felt that they all got what the deserved, but felt no sympathy for any of them, I was just glad I didn't have to listen to their amoral self pity anymore.  Although Fingersmith has been likened to Oliver, and it seems derivative in terms of setting, Sarah Waters original additions, (the lesbian relationship, the baby dealer, and the misogynistic con-man,) mired down rather than elevated this tale.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Every once in a while a band will achieve a near perfect realization of everything they're trying to accomplish. That's the case with this album. Zack's lyrics remain as intelligent, relentless and uncompromising as ever, and the delivery, beat, and Morello riffs are seamless as never before. Although I like the previous Rage music, there was a slight tendency to indulge a little too much of Morello's discordant experimentation for my tastes. But this album is more disciplined. More focused. And, simultaneously, an unapologetic assault. There are no clunkers here, and probably 10 out of 12 are masterpieces. You get the sense here that Rage really wanted more than to be a band. They wanted REVOLUTION, and try to incite it with every power chord, bass and drum thud, and shrieking manifesto. Where do I enlist?
B000056QE5|3.0|It gives me no pleasure to give a 3-star rating to a 5-star motion picture soundtrack.  But there's so much more they could be giving us.<br />Right now, you can purchase from Amazon the soundtrack to THE SOUND OF MUSIC.  It's a CD which contains 16 tracks.  However, if you're a bigger fan, you may purchase a 35th Anniversary Special Edition soundtrack to THE SOUND OF MUSIC which contains 31 tracks on two CDs.  This larger soundtrack contains instrumental music which you will not find on the original soundtrack.  In other words, you can purchase all of the music from the movie.<br />Why can't they do this with MARY POPPINS?  That's what I miss most!  It's the instrumental music without words (e.g. when George Banks was summoned to the bank at night and he walks by the St. Paul's Cathedral, the orchestra beautifully playing \\"Feed the Birds\\").<br />I am glad that all the songs (with words) are on here.  That alone makes it better than most soundtracks out there.  Another really great thing is the interviews at the end with the Sherman brothers who wrote the songs (as well as many other Disney songs).  They explain the origin of the song \\"A Spoonful of Sugar,\\" and they talk about several other songs including one which they loved very much but were unable to put in the film.<br />This year marks the film's 40th anniversary.  Hopefully, we will soon have out a complete MARY POPPINS soundtrack.

If you play Halo, it will answer so many things and give you a new look on the game. Try It!
B00013RC8O|5.0|Vanishing Point is one of the great existential counter-culture films of the 1970s. Like the similar-minded films, most notably, Two-Lane Blacktop and Duel, this car chase movie features an anti-hero protagonist who equates the open road with freedom and staying in one place for too long with death. For years we have had to suffer with pan and scanned VHS copies but now it has finally arrived on DVD in its original aspect ratio.<br />Fans of Vanishing Point are in for a real treat as both the US and UK versions of the film have been made available on DVD. The UK version runs seven minutes longer and features a scene where Kowalski picks up a female hitchhiker.<br />Director Richard C. Sarafian contributes an engaging audio commentary. So little has been written about Vanishing Point and it is great to hear Sarafian talk at length about his experiences making the movie.<br />Also included are vintage TV spots and a theatrical trailer that features wonderfully kitschy ad copy: \\"Everyone wants a piece of his hide!\\"<br />Vanishing Point is a cult film that has endured over the years. UK music group Primal Scream named their 1997 album after the movie and even recorded a song entitled \\"Kowalski\\" that features samples from the movie. Audioslave took their love of the film even further and brilliantly recreated and condensed the movie into a music video for their song, \\"Show Me How To Live.\\" The video incorporates actual footage from the movie and replaces Kowalski with the band. After years of obscurity, Vanishing Point has finally been given proper DVD treatment with an excellent transfer and made both versions available for fans to compare and contrast.
B0000AMRJC|1.0|Scarface is a movie full of violence and narcotraffic but also  full of lessons to teach the world. One of them is that money and power is not enough for someone to succeed. There must be passion, reason to live and entusiam, that's what living is all about, being able to give your best to others around you!The movie shows how immigrants try to succeed in a completely different country full of bureaucratic matters. For example  immigrants are not able to get really good jobs because they don't have employment authorization therefore they have to get basic job such as cleaning, chef and this time of things, when they get tired of it they enter into the world of drug dealings and assassin, that's exactly what Scarface shows us. The ambition of a better life can cost your life.<BR>The production of the movie was good, although certain parts were too obscene.<BR>All the main caracter developed their parts very well. The sound effects were well placed and I believe that it would be good for others to watch it as long as they get the full meaning out of it.
B00006J9OT|1.0|This CD will put you to sleep. Even her REMIXES are boring. I hate this CD!!!! She is not a DIVA. To be a DIVA you must have style, talent and some history.

0671015206|5.0|My original review appears below.  I was disappointed that only 1 of 7 people found my original review helpful.  Then I looked over other reviews of this book.  Most other reviewers received very few, if any, \\"yes\\" votes even though their reviews appeared quite informative.  Why is that, Amazon?  Before visitors to this site turn thumbs down on a review, maybe they should take some time to look at the book first.  Otherwise, how would they know if it was helpful or not?<br />\\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" is an well researched, well written, and easily understood book about the small business owners in our society.  The amazing truth is that the millionaires who own small businesses are pretty down to earth, simple people.  They live right \\"next door\\" to many of us and run, not high tech, but in many cases, mundane businesses like plumbing contractors, machine tool shops, and the like.  They are wealthy and they are careful, if not frugal, but definitely not cheap.  During my 18 years as a financial planner, I met many millionaire, successful small business owners who, through hard work and modest living accumulated some very significant wealth.  I also met a lot of high income professionals like lawyers, sales people, and image oriented executives who had lots of \\"stuff\\" but no true wealth.  The book by Stanley and Danko is an excellent analysis of America's vital small business community which creates the large majority of new jobs in our country and represents the true backbone of our economy.  Reading it will definitely increase one's economic IQ.
B00009TB5G|5.0|The biggest problem Tolkien fans have for the film versions of these books, particularly The Two Towers, is that they compare them too closely with the books.  When being critical of a movie, whether based on a book or not, one must judge it in the context of film alone.  As such, this movie is terrific, genius not just on the part of Peter Jackson's story telling skills, put a work of collective genius by artists, writers, craftsmen, and actors.  Sadly the ending doesn't have the \\"leave you hanging\\" feeling to the same extent of the first one, but there's enough of one to make you want to come back.  The acting was just on target for the characters, Merry, Pippin, and Gimli are particularly enjoyable and add much appreciated comic relieve.  Andy Serkis deserves an Oscar for his Gollum and Faramir's character is wonderfully complexe (thanks to the added scenes that never should have been cut) and so much love went into creating Rohan it's impossible not prefer Edoras to Minas Tirith (in the 3rd film).  The three plot style is wonderfully handled, never once losing the audience, and skillfully switches from one to another just when one plot is starting to be exposed for too long.  The only scenes which trouble me are Aragorn's mystic revival (kind of sappy but the irritation doesn't last long) and the Hurons marching to Helms Deep; it is confusing as you don't see enough of them and Treebeard doesn't explain the situation enough.      As for changes from the book, if one wants to explore that, I don't dissaprove of any of them, especially after the explanations in the extra features.  They do much to streamline a complicated plot that works great on a written page, but in a movie format would loose too many people.  The only change that irks me a little is Faramir, but after seeing Return of the King, and the flash backs (and his small lament over a fallen  enemy soldier that one might remember Sam thinking in the book)I feel they didn't change him so much as we justdiscover him more slowly-and maybe more realistically.  One more thing, thank GOD they made these pictures with a Historical Film mindset and not Fantasy Fiction.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation is a lovely film about two people who forge a friendship based on being lonely in each other's presence.  The film is billed as romantic comedy, but is really about friendship, and is tinged much with sorrow as it is with humor.  Bill Murray is convincing as a world-weary movie star alone in a business-like marriage. Scarlett Johansen is exceptional as a recently married, recently graduated philosophy major with a husband more in love with his photography career than with her.  The humanity of their relationship is juxtaposed with the technological nightmare that is modern Tokyo.  This is a delicate film that underscores a human truth: intimacy does not require long acquaintance, and long acquaintance does not equate with intimacy.
B000002LR6|4.0|My title says it all!  This album is the peak of Ministry, it's dark, disturbed, and intense.  If you want to know THE songs to know, they're NWO, Just One Fix, Hero, Jesus Built my Hotrod, Scare Crow, and Psalm 69.  That's basically the whole album, minus a few.  Those few are questionable additions, in my mind.  Corrosion, Grace, and TV II are not so hot.  Also, the album is on the short side, even with the mediocre songs.  Even so, six classic songs are more than most bands make in their entire career.  Awesome album!
B00004T9UF|5.0|It's hard to know what to make of Eminem, even if you know that half of what he says is sincere and half is a put-on; the trick is realizing that there's truth in the joke, and vice versa. Many dismissed his considerable skills as a rapper and social satirist because the vulgarity and gross-out humor on The Slim Shady LP were too detailed for some to believe that it was anything but real. To Eminem's credit, he decided to exploit that confusion on his masterful second record, The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem is all about blurring the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary, so it makes perfect sense that The Marshall Mathers LP is no more or no less &quot;real&quot; than The Slim Shady LP. It is, however, a fairly brilliant expansion of his debut, turning his spare, menacing hip-hop into a hyper-surreal, wittily disturbing thrill ride. It's both funnier and darker than his debut, and Eminem's writing is so sharp and clever that the jokes cut as deeply as the explorations of his ruptured psyche. The production is nearly as evocative as the raps, with liquid bass lines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes. There may not be overpowering hooks on every track, but the album works as a whole, always drawing the listener in. But, once you're in, Eminem doesn't care if you understand exactly where he's at, and he doesn't offer any apologies if you can't sort the fact from the fiction. As an artist, he's supposed to create his own world, and with this terrific second effort, he certainly has. It may be a world that is as infuriating as it is intriguing, but it is without question his own, which is far more than most of his peers are able to accomplish at the dawn of a new millennium.
0792838068|5.0|Leaving Las Vegas (1995)<br />Leaving Las Vegas, upon release, was praised for what a powerful film it was. I didn't watch it up until about a couple of years ago. Mainly because I'm not a Nicolas Cage fan. But this is undeniably one of the greatest performances of the 1990's. Elisabeth Shue also turns in a raving performance, as a Vegas call girl. Ben (Cage in his Oscar-winning role) is a movie executive whose also a hopeless alcoholic. After losing his job and family, Ben sets off to Las Vegas with his severance pay, to drink himself to death. Along the way he meets a beautiful call girl by the name of Sera (Shue in her Oscar-nominated role) and soon after they fall for each other. Neither one of them is ever tearing the other down for their problems and seem to find peace with one another. This movie works on many levels. The main one is the love story -- that's anything but conventional. The other is the alcohol. We watch Ben kill himself slowly with massive ammounts of alcohol-- at some point, wishing he would just say no. The same for Sera, who is a genuine character you care about, you just want her to say no. I'm hoping MGM will release a nice little 2-Disc set for this movie. Some extras would be nice -- especially some deleted scenes and maybe some behind-the-scenes. The DVD -- both sound and video wise -- is excellent, it just lacks special features. All in all, the movie is one of the best of 1995 -- considering that it was up against such greats as Braveheart and Dead Man Walking.<br />Leaving Las Vegas was nominated for 4 Academy Awards including:<BR>Actor In A Leading Role -- Nicolas Cage {&quot;Ben&quot;}<BR>Actress In A Leading Role -- Elisabeth Shue {&quot;Sera&quot;}  <BR>Directing -- Mike Figgis<BR>Best Adapted Screenplay -- Mike Figgis
B0001AVZA8|1.0|After numerous wonderful reviews, I went to watch this movie.  It's entertaining if you don't mind being told in a movie when something funny is going to happen and that you should be prepared to laugh.<br />I am in my early 30s and have never known anyone (male or female) to find someone almost 3 times their age attractive, much less this film's Harry.  Harry is not believable as a successful hop hop record producer nor is he believable as stud who can have any 20-something year old woman he wants.  I give 20-something year old women more credit than that.<br />Erica weeps for days over the loss of her love Harry.  She weeps as she pathetically tells him she loves him and she wishes it lasted more than a week.  Later Erica tells Marin that she had never taken a chance with love before as she continues to cry.  I was disgusted in the theater - close to walking out - crying over a over person who you loved for years and then betrayed you is believable - this farce was not.  Give us a break - had Erica been 20 and Harry been 25 we would have chalked the short-term failed relationship to infatuation.  Why just because these characters are older are we expected to believe the unbelievable?  I give older women more credit than that.
0783227434|2.0|Evil Dead fans all hailed this the best film of the series...WHY?!? I loved Evil Dead, and the sequel was just as amazing. So, I wait for the third installment. Video stores where I live don't have movies like this, so I pre-ordered it from Amazon and waited. Once the DVD arrived, I wished I could've shipped it back! I failed to find the obnoxious humor that every other fan knew and loved. The film wasn't scary, more of a comedy -- and a bad one at that! Bruce Campbell reprises his role from Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn -- and director Sam Raimi returns to direct this piece of $h!T -- what a joke! Film is terrible, in short, if you loved Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 because of the gory fun and (sometimes) funny plot, then avoid this like the plague!

0380789035|4.0|The litmus test of a satisfying read is a sense of sadness when the cover closes on the final page because you must say good-bye to everyone you've met.  Rarely is the ending of an enjoyable book satisfying, but in American Gods, Neil Gaiman provides not only an ending that is expected and fitting, but an epilogue and postscript that are comforting as well.  There is nothing surprising about how this book closes, and that is what I liked about it most.  If you trust the storyteller, he takes you and his story exactly where you both need to go.<br />I come to Gaiman, not from the Sandman books, but from Neverwhere (a moody, inventive, and haunting adventure tale) and Coraline (a children's novel that will take its place alongside those of Dahl and Burnett).  American Gods is the next logical step for this writer: a far-flung epic that not only exceeds the author's reach, but does so in a way that will only make him better in his future efforts.<br />The central story here is of a man named Shadow who is caught between life and death in the human realm and immortality, glory, and obselescence among the earthly and ethereal forms of gods across the ages.  Although the central story is a bit plodding and sputtering in places, the overall construction of the book and the always entertaining writing of Gaiman delivers a novel that was simply made to be read and enjoyed.  The main character of this book really is America as seen through outside eyes, and everything that happens takes place only because of America.  This isn't complicated literature, and it isn't a simple good vs. evil story, either.  It just happens to be a fantastic read that exists on its own terms.
0800177177|4.0|This 1992 adaptation of Bram Stoker's magnum opus is fairly faithful to the source, though there are a few noticeable changes, not the least of which is a blatant depiction of the sex and eroticism that are only tacit elements of the Victorian novel.  Another obvious change is the addition of a prologue in which it is revealed how, as his punishment for blaspheming God and cursing the church, the Turk known as Vlad the Impaler was transformed into Dracula the vampire (Gary Oldman).  The real purpose of this scene is to set up a later plot point--also an augmentation of the original story--in which Dracula, now residing in England, learns that Mina (Winona Ryder) is the reincarnation of his true love from his previous mortal life and subsequently becomes obsessed with re-acquiring her.  This, of course, becomes the underlying impetus behind all of his later actions.  (At the time of this film's release, many film critics pointed out that this reincarnation concept is lifted directly from Dan Curtis' 1973 TV-movie adaptation of the novel, which was scripted by the venerable genre writer Richard Matheson.)<br />Still, BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA does, overall, return to the novel's gothic roots.  A lot of the action takes place in crumbling old Carpathian castles, filthy Victorian insane asylums, or dusky English manor houses, and most scenes are played out dramatically in the usual operatic style of a period piece.  Director Francis Ford Coppola skillfully layers nearly every shot with rich detail, and often the foreground action is in danger of being upstaged by spooky little events or eerie bits of scenery in the background.  (A prime example of this is the now-famous shadow imagery in Dracula's castle, which moves independently of the people or objects casting those shadows.)  And aesthetes and art historians are often quick to point out that some of the more lavish costumes, especially some of those worn by Dracula himself, are directly inspired by the ornate artwork of Gustav Klimt, a Viennese artist who was a contemporary of writer Stoker.<br />For the most part, the acting in the film is excellent.  Gary Oldman's portrayal of Dracula is superb.  Through the course of the film, he skillfully segues from a Turkish warrior to a centuries-old bloodsucker, and he is especially effective (i.e., downright scary!) when his character assumes the form of a giant, gargoyle-like bat.  Master thespian Anthony Hopkins appears as Dracula's primary nemesis, Professor Abraham Van Helsing, and his eccentric characterization of the enigmatic occultist is delightfully over the top.  Hopkins often nibbles playfully on the scenery, nearly upstaging his co-stars.  Though her British accent is sometimes obviously phony, pretty Winona Ryder does an excellent job as the object of Dracula's romantic interests,  and the casting of Tom Waits as Renfield is a master stroke, as his bizarre but affecting performance so suits the mentally deranged character that it rivals Dwight Frye's much-lauded and equally outr&eacute; portrayal in the classic 1931 Universal film. The only real weak link in the cast is Keanu Reeves.  Though he tries hard, he just can't entirely shake off that surfer-dude posture that has become his trademark, and it takes a little effort on the part of the audience to accept him as a (whoa!) Victorian-era solicitor like Jonathan Harker.<br />All in all, 1992's BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA is a very satisfying horror film that, though not a stringent interpretation of Stoker's famous novel, is nonetheless loyal to the book's gothic ambiance and Victorian roots.  In fact, fans of Stoker's literary opus will be delighted to see that, unlike the more famous 1931 version starring Bela Lugosi, this film keeps the book's primary plotline more or less intact.  True, the pursuing-lost-love graft is a bit distracting at times, and it really doesn't work all that well, but it's only a minor flaw in the film's overall scope.<br />Columbia/Tristar's basic DVDrelease of BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA is a no-frills disc, the only bonus (?) being the option to view the film in either 16:9 anamorphic widescreen format or 4:3 pan-and-scan.  Picture quality--at least on the widescreen side--is very good and the retail price of the disc is reasonable.  But Columbia/Tristar also offers a SuperBit edition, and as with most of their SuperBit offerings, the picture quality is superior, especially when viewed on a widescreen HDTV.  Though it is a bit pricier than the standard edition, videophiles in the horror-fan crown will think it well worth the additional cost.se of BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA is a no-frills disc, the only bonus (?) being the option to view the film in either 16:9 anamorphic widescreen format or 4:3 pan-and-scan.

B000174LVQ|5.0|The first time that I saw De Lucia perform, almost a quarter of a century ago in Toronto, I didn't know who he was. I had come to see the other two guitarist on the bill, John McLaughlin and Al Demeola, and I couldn't imagine how this unknown Spanish guy could possibly share a stage with universe-class guitarists at the peak of their creative powers. What a surprise I got. It wasn't that De Lucia was more lyrical than Demeola and, mindbogglingly, faster than McLaughlin, it was that he hit every note he played dead centre all night. I had never experienced in concert the incredible mixture of beauty and technique that his playing so effortlessly displayed. I have been a big fan ever since, and it is delightful to hear him still making marvelous music with grace, imagination and originality. The inclusion of voices on this CD make it a little different from the Spanish and Catalan guitar music most people are familiar with, but the playing is a delight to listen to from the first cut to the last. This is De Lucia's first album in some time, and his skill is not in the least diminished. Anyone who loves guitar music should give this a listen.

My, how they have grown since the early days. I have been listening to Iron Maiden since the early 80's and yes, they have grown. But they most definately haven't lost the touch. From sitting down to the first note, you're gaurenteed not to move until you've heard the entire CD. It is captivating. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
0385512104|5.0|Hesitant to read this book after learning it was a &quot;Today Show&quot; pick, I'm glad I disregarded the hype and bought a copy anyway.  I'm one for things off the beaten path, and was pleasantly surprised to find that this book was just that.  Part &quot;Rainman,&quot; part &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and part &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; this dark and funny tale is so well-crafted that reading it comes as a shock.  Most books out there are one thing or another (funny, disturbing, irritating) but &quot;The Curious Incident&quot; has  little of everything and is so well put together that you'll be doing double takes, asking yourself where this author has been.  <br />By far the best thing around, please do yourself a favor and read this book.<br />Also recommended:  Bark of the Dogwood by McCrae
B000002L99|3.0|I love Van Halen but after 1984 they just went totally pop. While their first few albums are heavy, loud and uncouth after Diamond Dave left, what can I say? I got this album in a library book sale on cassete. I was overjoyed at seeing a Van Halen album. I immediatley purchased it. But I was rather dissapointed when I stuck it it my my player. Dreams and Love Walks In are totally synth pop songs. If you are a pop-leaning Van Halen fan this is for you but I am a headbanger so if there are any like me get VH I instead.

0520089308|2.0|I recently came across this book as I tried to look for some newer translations of China's classics--Romance of Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West, Dream of the Red Chamber, Plum in the Golden Vase, etc.  Especially, with the idea that it would be great to find either a translation that would be as good as C.H. Brewitt Taylor's translation or minutely detailed as David Tod Roy's Plum in the Golden Vase.  Lastly the inclusion of Chinese characters beside it and the current Pinyin system used to spell Chinese names.  While it satisfies in one area with the Chinese beside an english version and including the new Pinying system, oddly enough the translation seems not that good for a Chinese professor of Dr. Moss Roberts calibur.  While misspellings are often unavoidable, but misspelling the the leader of the Yellow Turban (not scarf), as Zhang Jue instead of Zhang Jiao.  Then translating zi as style seems to further dilute what this character means, which is one's courtesy or gentleman's name.  Style might suggest that the characters named themselves to suit their own pleasures and boost themselves in the sight of others.  When these men attempted to exhibit humility with vigor.  With these minor mistakes, I can only imagine what sort of liberties are taken with the poetry incorporating within the text.  One might say the author uses a meaning for meaning translation, which it can more effective than a word for word translation.  However the author takes too many liberties just in the beginning of the text.  I would only recommend this work to anyone that is not familiar with this era or is just interested in reading this piece of literature for fun.  However for language students, that found Roy's minute dissection of Jin Ping Mei appealing will need to wait for another translation.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Being 35 and put off by all of the reality TV these days, I RARELY watch prime time tv anymore. That said, Firefly is a show I would have gladly tuned into had it been given a fair shake. And hey FOX, get this, I'm not even remotely a Buffy or Angel fan. I'm more of a Homicide, Law & Order, The Shield fan...HELL...even a Sports Night, West Wing fan. Joss Whedon's pet project is very much worthy of a Serinity movie (THANKS  Universal) and much, much more.    The cast is perfect. They have great chemistry and clearly love what they're doing. What can I say but...shiny. I love the fact that there are no \\"guest stars\\" unless you count the superb Richard Brooks (Law & Order) in Objects In Space. Mostly fresh faces with no baggage from other shows. (I can't get over the fact that McGuyver is on Stargate)    Great CGI (for TV) with handheld shots of space with light flares, out of focus shots, and zooms and pulls. The DVD set (in correct order) makes you forget you're watching tv. Innovative tv cinematography work is going on here.    Firefly has a great sense of humor that had me laughing out loud on the couch. Not an easy feat for a tv show.    Some detractors say there are too many stereotypes here to be a really good and original show. Trust me, you will fall in love with this cast just like the cast of the Enterprise. You'll find no bumpy headed alien named Xoorimar from the planet Zargon. This show is about people. Another reason I feel it works so well.    Bottom line, Joss made a believer even out of even my cynical girlfriend who said \\"Sci-fi western, pffffft, yeah right, I'm watching that.\\" Imagine if Fox really gave this show a fair shake? The was sooo much potential for future episodes. This was obviously a labor of love. Even someone who isn't a fan of sci-fi could see that. 2000+ customer reviews shows how passionate people are for this series. So many unanswered questions remain. Remember what Gene Roddenberry's little series was able to do on NBC way back in the late 60's. Hell, my favorite show, Homicide, wouldn't have been around to win 3 Peabody Awards for excellence(only show in history to do so) if it wasn't for Warren Littlefield's determined, stand-alone vision at NBC.  \\"We looked at this piece in development called Homicide: Life on the Street, and we said, 'This is special. And if we can, we ought to be able to . . . hold on to this. Because these shows just don't come along all that often.' Firefly is one of these shows. Have some vision Fox. Just think of all the Firefly DVD box sets we'd buy in the future($$$). Thank you Joss & Tim!
4893580914|5.0|This is an excellent Kanji book! After trying several other Kanji learning books, this one stands out as the best by far! The book is organized exteremely well into sections and lessons. For every lesson there are about 10 different Kanji that you learn and each lesson has some kind of a theme to it. For example, one lesson may cover only numbers, another lesson will cover only animals, etc. There are also exercises at the end of each lesson so you can practice what you just learned. If I had to name one downside to this book, it would be that the answers to the exercises are not listed in the back of the book as they are in many practice books. But overall, I can't say enough good things about this book. It has helped me with my Kanji tremendously!
B00012QM8G|5.0|The movie itself gets 5 stars, but this review is about Universal's refusal to address a certain problem.  I, along with many other people on this site, have had problems with DVD-18s made by Universal, most notably 'Casino' & 'Schindler's List'... the kicker is that the stores will not refund the movie because of copyright laws... they tell you to get another one which freeze and skip also. So due to these problems and Universal's refusal to spend an extra few cents to make another disc, I am BOYCOTTING Universal DVDs. Warner Bros. stopped making doubled sided disc with 'E.R.' & 'West Wing', why can't Universe-smell do the same thing? simple: MONEY. PROFIT. Send them a message, folks. Because this will be the only way they will listen. I shouldn't have to wonder if a movie is gonna play right when I buy it... simply pathetic. And this is not even getting into the music copyright problems with 'Quantum Leap', which I quit buying cos of the double sided disc. Universal suck. I hope they are reading this.

B00005JN02|4.0|It's October 1989, and East Berliner Alex Kerner (Daniel Br&uuml;hl), the teenage son of Communist Party stalwart Christiane (Katrin Sa&szlig;), is arrested during a peaceful demonstration in the streets approaching The Wall. On her way to receive an honor for her service to the German Democratic Republic, Mom witnesses her boy's apprehension and has a heart attack that thrusts her into a coma, which lasts until June 1990. By then, The Wall has effectively been breached, Western capitalism has invaded East Berlin with a vengeance, Christiane's teenage daughter Ariane (Maria Simon) has dropped out of the university to get a job at the new Burger King, where she's taken up with a &quot;Wessie&quot; (a West Berliner), and Alex has fallen for Lara (Chulpan Khamatova), a student nurse from the USSR.<br />After Alex insists that his mother be released for at-home convalescence, the doctor makes clear that any shock to the patient's system will likely kill her. Since Communism is all that Christiane has ever known, Alex contrives an elaborate scheme to shield his bed-ridden mother from all evidence of The Wall's collapse and the West's victory of materialism over her socialist world. What is she to think of that gigantic Coca-Cola advert hanging from the apartment building opposite her window?<br />The improbable prospects for the con's success aside, GOOD BYE LENIN is a witty, clever, and sometimes poignant look at the wave of change which swept through East Berlin after the surprisingly sudden meltdown of Die Mauer, carrying forward the young and resilient with the flow, but leaving many bitter, old guard stranded in unfamiliar territory .<br />Bruehl, resembling a young Christopher Reeve, is enormously engaging as the young man trying to do the right thing for his Mom, especially as it was his civil disobedience that catalyzed her physical debilitation in the first place. Christiane elicits much sympathy from the viewer. But she, too, has a secret that she's been keeping from her children for years.<br />As a child of the Cold War era - born in 1949 - I gazed transfixed at the TV images in the closing weeks of 1989 as Die Mauer was danced upon and assaulted by raucous Berlin crowds from both the East and West. After all, I'd grown up with The Bomb, the Evil Empire, and Nikita's shoe-pounding at the U.N., and had myself navigated Checkpoint Charlie on a couple of occasions. GOOD BYE LENIN is a glimpse of The Wall's demise from the other side, and with a humorous twist. One only need visit the Berlin of today, pass through the once off-limits Brandenburg Gate, and walk down the Unter den Linden to witness the startling transformation enabled by that event.r children for years.<br />As a child of the Cold War era - born in 1949 - I gazed transfixed at the TV images in the closing weeks of 1989 as Die Mauer was danced upon and assaulted by raucous Berlin crowds from both the East and West.

B00018D3RI|5.0|Alas, the buddy show is apparently a dead genre.  I miss it, but through the magic of DVDs I can watch the good old stuff without commercials or awkward edits that destroy the plot.  Considering the age of this show, the DVDs look remarkably good.  There are some lines and specks on the film, and the sound warbles on occasion, but unless you're a A/V purist these things won't really detract from viewing.  The packaging is a hoot.  It's obvious the designers considered the Torino the real star of the show.  *G*<br />I find I'm watching more DVDs instead of current programming, and creating my own personal TV seasons without the obnoxious reality programming and depressing morality plays.  Starsky & Hutch harkens back to an era when TV was supposed to be entertainment, rather than an excuse to show and lecture viewers on how human beings are inherently evil, or pander so blatantly to the lowest common denominator.  Up until 10-8 aired, I hadn't followed any cop shows since, oh, probably the early '90's, since the new cop shows are all too dark and depressing, and contain so many thoroughly unlikeable and downright despicable characters.  If I want to be depressed, I can turn on the news or read the latest statistics about politics, the economy, and unemployment.<br />When viewing Starsky & Hutch episodes, it's important to remember that they reflect the times they were made and aired.  I can assure everyone that today's most popular shows, fashions, and hairstyles will be considered at best dated, and even goofy and passe, in 10 to 15 years.<br />Starsky & Hutch was not corny for its time period; instead it was edgy, morally ambiguous (consider previous shows like Adam-12, Dragnet, etc.), made people think about issues they'd prefer to ignore, and was even criticized for being too violent.  It paved the way for today's much grimmer and grotesquely violent shows.<br />Overall, if you enjoyed the series and the cop-adventure and buddy genres, this set is for you.  Someday, the buddy show may again come back into vogue.  Until then, I've got my DVDs.  Now, if only Miami Vice and The Sentinel would be released...
B00005JMJ4|5.0|We all know Sofia had a starring role in Godfather III and that she sucked.  I know I was happy when her character died.  So it was with some hesitation that I rented this movie - just her name sent shivers up my spine.  <br />Wow.  What a beautiful piece of work. I watched this with my father, and his only comment after the film was &quot;I don't understand why he didn't get any from her&quot;.  He missed a lot.  And not just the lesson about saying something like that in front of your daughter.  I attempted to explain the themes of growing too large for things and not quite fitting in, etc..., all to no avail.  But hey, at least he watched something without Ahhhhhhnold in it for a change!<br />This film is subtle and brilliant, and definitely needs to be viewed more than once.  Bill Murray's best role since Rushmore (and if you liked that movie, you'll like this one), and Scarlett Johanssen's best since Ghost World (which grew on me after several viewings).  This makes up for that sappy, quasi-feminist Hollywood slop of a film, Mona Lisa Smile, in Johanssen's repertoire.<br />A seriously intelligent piece of work, and visually stunning to boot.  Highly recommended.
0385504209|5.0|I picked this up at a time when I depressed and grieving. It was engrossing from the first page and gave me exactly the escape for which I was thirsting. I disagree with previous reviewers: I think it is well-researched. There is an afterward, and alternative histories of Mary Magdalene's life have abounded for years. Dan Brown wasn't the first to give life to them, just one of the first to end up on the best seller list.<br />I admit, as a former catholic school teacher, it did make me question exactly what the early Church had covered up. And that's exactly why it's so fascinating: could it be true? Could anyone ever prove it indefinitely? These questions are wrapped up in a tight plot that entertains as well as enlightens.<br />I recommend this book to folks who want or need to escape from the world for a little while. And if it inspires anyone else to read a more academic book about the early Church, or DaVinci, or art history,  or the holy Grail, than all the better. For that reason alone, I think high schoolers would enjoy this book as well as adults.<br />One note regarding the review about the inaccurate portrayal  of  Leonardo's LAST SUPPER. In The DaVinci Code, I thought the protagonist, the Harvard symbologist, made it clear that DaVinci was a bit of a prankster. Thus, it's entirely plausible that he would accurately label  the apostle to the right of Jesus as John, but also, keep the painting obtuse enough to also be plausibly Mary Magdalene. After all, in DaVinci's time, who would get away with portraying Mary Magdalene that way (which begs the question, would it be easy to get away with it now? ).
B0000UHFC6|5.0|Being the huge Lord of The Rings fan that I am (which has a name like Trekkie but cooler - Ringer) I of course bought this CD just like the two before it and as usual I was not disappointed. Howard Shore is one of the best movie soundtrack composers I know of and his music never falls flat. The music on this soundtrack is different from the first two movies since it gives the listener closure. We know this is the end and the music reflects that. Few movie soundtracks (and music in general) move me to tears and this one has done it for the third time. You listen to the music and remember the scenes from the movie with a bitter sweet sadness. Thank you Howard Shore for doing it again.
0385504209|3.0|Dan Brown has written an entertaining book.  Good fiction requires a foundation of fact.  However, many premise concepts of this book are far from accurate.  I am not writing this review to simply defend traditional Christian views of Christ.  However, every reader should be aware that Brown is simply writing for entertainment.  He changes well known facts about art history, in particular, Leonardo Da Vinci's life and work.  He also changes well documented history of the formation of the Catholic church, the canonization of the Bible, and 4th century concepts of Jesus' divinity.  It is obvious why he did this...to be polemic.  It (obviously) sells books!  He follows historical fact as far as it serves his story's purposes.  But, when he needed to spice up the story or maintain plot he freely changed historical facts to fiction.  If nothing else, my hope is that The Da Vinci Code will spark curiosity in all of these readers so that they will do their own research.  Then they can discover more about the real history that Brown has sprinkled into his fiction.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I have always been interested in WWII and learning about what the people went through in those days. I learned a lot from how the movie was protrayed. This movie is hard to watch but I still enjoy watching it. I feel that everyone should learn about the war and what people went through in that day in age. I wanted to watch it on my own then had to watch it in school and I felt that more people learned about the killing from the movie. I am so glad that this movie was done and that it was rereleased. I have showed this movie to a lot of friends who now better understand things now that they have watched the movie. I would recommend this movie for anyone.
B000002AV5|2.0|In the day when I collected commercial music from my 1980s childhood, Sade, though they had only one hit (\\"Smooth Operator\\" - which sounded to me back then like \\"New Corporation\\") in my native Australia, were one of the most mentioned artists in music advertisements.<br /><br />\\"Smooth Operator\\" I had always found enjoyable with its melodic, even haunting saxophone lines and seemingly interesting lyrics about travel across the United States. \\"Your Love Is King\\" and \\"Hang On To Your Love\\" had some truly beautiful - at least I would have though on hearing them on radio - vocals that completely overshadowed the lack of depth or fire in the backing. \\"Jezebel\\" and \\"The Sweetest Taboo\\" from Sade's second album \\"Promises\\" were even slower but had proportionately more beautiful, even absorbing vocals.<br /><br />However, that is where it really starts to go downhill, for on later songs there is no way in which Sade Adu's deep vocals can make up in any way at all for the lameness of her backing players. Most of the later songs really seem to stop, stop and start only in the most momentary way one could ever imagine. These songs really proved impossible for me to sit through them back in the middle 1990s when I bought this album, and I never have thought I would want to try. At times, even Sade Adu's voice can seem a little soppy rather than deep.<br /><br />Apart from the early singles, there is nothing even listenable here even if the album is far less dated than most music of its type from the 1980s.
1558908382|4.0|anytime you'll attend a high school reunion, wouldn't it be nice to brag about a career, say a banker maybe. but how are you going to explain to a bunch of friends and an old flame you're a retiring hitman? there lies the plot.<br />GPB may not be an oscar caliber movie but it sure delivers a  punch and shot(all pun intended!). the script is very witty, most of them became a byword in everyday conversation. &quot;a bimmer in detroit? that's sacrilege!&quot; &quot;ten years man! ten years!&quot; &quot;i freaked out. i joined the army. now i work for myself.&quot; &quot;you brokered the sale of my house? well thank you for profiting in my childhood!&quot; &quot;we took your old pictures from the class album. special torture!&quot; these are just some of the funny lines you'll hear in this movie. <br />and john cusack was cool in this one. he played the very troubled and wary hitman so good you'd think he was once one before. jeremy piven as usual is so striking that if it's your first time to watch him, you'd either loathe him or love him right away.<br />all in all the movie is great. even hank azaria has some funny moments here. if ever there is a crime here, it's about nepotism. all 3 of john's siblings are in here. but then again they all got away with it, marvelously.
055321263X|5.0|Everyone has their own criteria for what makes a great novel-for me the best praise is that(in the words of an earlier reviewer) I was desperate for lunchtime at work and hometime so that I could continue reading.I forwent sleep untill I'd finished the book.It took me three days when a similar-length novel can take me months.When  you sacrifice things to read a book you KNOW you have a pearl.When you &quot;don't have the time&quot; you have an also-ran.<BR>This book,for me,had everything:Fantastic prose(Austen-like),deep characters,convoluted plot,humour, supense.I shy from naming a favourite character out of fear of disloyalty to the others! I'd previously read Brave New World and it was just so awful with it's two dimensional characters and plot (albeit an outstanding idea)and I think this helped my appreciation of The Woman in White.I'd never even heard of it until recently.I,of course, would recommend you read this and,short of weddings,funerals,etc.be prepared to sacrifice your engagements!
078322804X|5.0|Why watch a 1980 movie?<br /><br />* Great music<br />* Great car chases and crashes<br />* John Belushi, Dan Aykroyd, James Brown, Cab Calloway, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Steve Cropper, Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Twiggy, Frank Oz, Chaka Khan, John Lee Hooker, Steven Spielberg, and many more<br />* A funny plot as strong as the characters<br /><br />You've heard about the car chases and pileups? Besides the massive crunching and flying of vehicles, they show you the real Chicago as well as the landmarks. As chases go, I have never seen a better one. It is like \\"Starsky and Hutch\\" times 250.<br /><br />Seeing Cab Calloway is a high point. He was 73 when the movie came out, and told a younger generation that \\"Minnie the Moocher\\" was a red hot hoochie-coocher. His fame was mostly in the 1940s but his swagger still remained.<br /><br />Many of the actors with bit parts are surprising. Steven Spielberg and Chaka Khan sneak in there, as does Frank Oz. Calloway, Belushi, Candy, Hooker are gone from this life, and James Brown's career is stymied by personal troubles. The movie has all of them together.<br /><br />Everything is about Jake and Elwood's mission from God. That's how they see their goal of raising money for an orphanage. They only know one way of making legit cash, and that's through music. Jake has been incarcerated and so the Blues Brothers band broke up. Jake and Elwood gather up the old member one by one, and finally talk their way into a gig. There are enough police who would see it another way, and other bands, old girlfriends, Nazis and wives getting in the way, and into some of the most fun that ever hit Lower Wacker.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD are interesting. The documentary is the only real value, considering John Belushi's untimely death. The sound lacks in depth and stereo quality. You can make up for this by buying the soundtrack.<br /><br />I fully recommend \\"The Blues Brothers.\\"<br /><br />Anthony Trendl<br />editor, HungarianBookstore.com
B000089RVX|2.0|ok, I've heard about 5 songs from this album, each of them sounds like either like X-Ecutioners &amp; Linkin Park - It's Going Down, or Linkin Park - With You or With You (reanimation remix). Their guitars suck, that guy who's trying to be an emcee like Mike Shinoda from Linkin Park gets on my nerves. They may sound &quot;hot&quot; on a cd, but i bet they suck in concert. Don't waste your money on this unless you like this type of music.
B00006HBUA|5.0|It's funny for the kids and for us adults it's got some great sarcastic humor.  Lots of &quot;wink-wink-it's-Scooby-stupid&quot; humor.  If you're expecting Lord of the Rings...this isn't it.  If you are hoping for Lost In Translation...then go rent it.  But if you want a funny film that doesn't mind being silly then you've come to the right place.  Get out a box of Scooby snacks, sit back, and enjoy the mad jokes.  Just watch out for the ghosts watching over your shoulder.

B000069KE0|5.0|Ignore this idiots review. Chicago II (or Chicago as it was originally called) is and always will be one of the the top 100 albums of all time. From 25 or 6 to 4 to &amp;quot;The Ballet&amp;quot; to It Better End Soon and the rest of the CD it is packed with great original music. Mr.?? Redmond (or is that a Jann Wenner psedonym) with his Cleveland address must either work for the R &amp; R HOF or Rolling Stone Mag. Cause those 2 BS concerns are the only ones who hate Chicago. Which is why Chicago is not in the R &amp; R HOSHAM!!!!!
0440234743|3.0|Like some of the reviewers who posted earlier, I really liked how the book began and was very intrigued. Hell, I was thinking this one can also be made into a movie. I really am impressed with his geographic and description of locations, they truly place the reader there. Also, Grisham did a nice job of keeping the reader in limbo throughout the beginning - as is typical of his style. However, I think he then took a wrong turn in Albequerque. The pages became heavier to turn and I found myself yawning quite a bit. I did not think the title of the book would mean I would receieve a sermon. I flat out hated the ending and was left dissapointed at the prospect of what could have been. I felt like Cathy Bates in Misery. Mr. Grisham, WRITE ME A NEW ENDING!
0446677450|5.0|I cannot believe the powerful benefits of following the Rich Dad Philosophy. Before reading RDPD, I too was a member of the rat race and feeling like a rat. I really believed that my house was an asset and felt lucky to be working and was grateful for my college education.<br />When my company became a victim of a hostile takeover and m assive downsizing insued, I became aware of what Rich Dad taught Robert Kiyosaki so many years ago. Although I had heard about this book before, I dismissed it as &quot;get rich quick&quot; quackery appropiate for the naive. I had been to college. To smart for this junk, or so I thought.<br />Then I was downsized and hit the streets with my resume. While waiting for employers to call me, I took the time to read Rich Dad Poor Dad. I hated it at first and even though it was so small, it took me an inordinate amount of time to read the book.<br />After being turned down time after time after time for jobs, I decided to pour into RDPD after seeing Mr. Kiyosaki on tv. To wit, I also went out and bought Cashflow Quadrant and Rich Dad Success Stories.<br />Out of curiosity, I called a few real estate ads for homes for sale in my area and found plenty of &quot;don't wanters.&quot; I also found several business opportunities including network marketing.<br />I jumped on an opportunity to take over a business on lease purchase deal with nothing down. I also became a landlord buying a home with nothing down. I am still considering that network marketing opportunity.<br />Best of all, one of the companies that I applied for a job with called me offering me a position with their company and I happily told them that I didn't need their job and I had found the perfect boss. When they asked me who I was working for I said &quot;Myself!&quot; and went on to tell them that I would never work for a employer again.<br />I am happier and more content than I have been in years. To fully appreciate the value of Rich Dad's advice, pick up a copy of Rich DadPoor Dad and Rich Dad's Success Stories. I also recommend Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad website.<br />Kiyosaki changed my life. Previously I was discouraged and frustrated hopelessly depending on a company to take care of me. Now I realize that nobody will take care of me better than I will.<br />Rich Dad Poor Dad started it all for me. Thank you Rich Dad! Thank you Mr. Kiyosaki!
B00012QM8G|4.0|There are at least three packaged versions of this film on DVD as of its release date:  Movie/extras only, movie/extras with souvenir book, and horribly overpriced collector's edition with &quot;sturdy&quot; yet irrelevant display case.  I bought the one with the souvenir book, primarily because it came at no additional cost over the movie-only version.<br />The souvenir book is a throwaway item.  All it has is a few dozen stills from the film.  You thumb through it once, realize it is nothing special, then set it aside, never to pick it up again in all likelihood.<br />The film, of course, is just shy of masterful.  The DVD release offers it in DTS sound, which makes a WORLD of difference in the enjoyment of the film.<br />The disc is a &quot;flipper&quot;, as they are called by DVD afficianados.  A flipper is a disc that contains most of the movie on Side A and the conclusion on Side B.  You have to get up and flip the disc over during the course of the film.  Boo.  That feature was annoying enough (though almost always necessary) with LaserDiscs, but should not have to be a factor with DVDs.  [Actually, most higher-end LaserDisc players had 2-sided play -- the machine would scan the other side of the disc without you having to do anything but wait a few moments for the transition.  The only real drawback was having to change discs if the film's running time necessitated more than one disc]. Other films with the same running time as &quot;Schindler's List&quot; have fit comfortably on one DVD disc side for uninterrupted viewing.  I only know a tiny bit about technical specs and limitations on DVD disc space.  Perhaps it is the inclusion of the separate DTS track space that uses up too much of the disc side to fit the whole film onto Side A.  It CERTAINLY wasn't because of a director's commentary.  Spielberg hates those and has pretty much promised to never make one.<br />The other footage/features on Side B are interesting but a bit lacking in quantity for what consumers have come to expect from high-profile DVD releases.<br />Other reviewers have suggested that the &quot;flipper&quot; disc just comes off as being cheap and low-rent:  that perhaps a 2-disc set with nicely done artwork on the discs' cover side might have at least looked a bit more presentable and classy.<br />I agree whole-heartedly.  I mean, if you're gonna have to use a second disc side to watch the film, at least a bit of physical &quot;production value&quot; to match the film's &quot;event status&quot; release would have nice.<br />Not that there is anything too terribly WRONG with a flip-disc movie.  It's not the end of the world.  But by this point in DVD history, many customers have at least a minimum expectation of the aesthetic classiness of a disc's appearance.<br />But we've come to expect this from Spielberg movies on DVD lately.  The &quot;Raiders&quot; trilogy was disappointingly anemic when it came to bonus features,  and only a few of those were less than 15 years old.  The wonderful LaserDisc box set collector's edition of &quot;Jaws&quot; in 1995 had a fascinating 2 hour documentary included, but the DVD release in 2001 saw it cut down to just over half that length.<br />Still, it is great to have &quot;Schindler's List&quot; on DVD  --  get it in WIDESCREEN format everyone!  But don't buy it expecting a plethora of bonus features or bells and whistles.  They just aren't there.  There is, however, some Holocaust Survivor and Holocaust Foundation-related stuff included (the documentary stuff).  But that was included more for the purpose of pushing the director's message across rather than for the purpose of treating the DVD buyers to the fun and interesting treats that can come with the nifty DVD format.<br />A great DVD release model for this film could have been any one of several New Line Cinema DVD releases that came out single or double disc and with tons of extras.  Examples:  &quot;The Sweet Hereafter&quot;, &quot;Se7en&quot;, and &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;.d &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;.
0671015206|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door is without doubt one of the best financial books ever published. It tells you exactly how millionaires became millionaires.<br />Unfortunetly, achieving wealth requires discipline. Too many people would rather live for today and forget about tomorrow. Too many people think that success is a college degree and keeping up with the Jones's. The higher their income, the higher their lifestyle.<br />Interesting that small business owners were so successful and that the most successful were normally mundane businesses. I read that the #1 producer of millionaires in small business was via dry cleaning. And you thought it was technology!<br />The Millionaire Next Door is a powerful book that can positively change your life. Some others include Rich Dad Poor Dad, The Automatic Millionaire and More Wealth Without Risk.

0767903862|5.0|This is a very funny book. Easy read with heaps of humor. Having been to Australia twice and preparing for my third journey, I found Bryson's book quite accurate about the Aussies. They are wonderful people, it is a wonderful country, and this is a wonderful book.
B00006AUIG|5.0|&quot;Session 9&quot; was one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time.  Pointless gore and screaming at a minimum, with character development making us actually care about the people in the story, and subtle nuances making the movie excellent and disturbing at the same time.  Everything said or done in the movie, right down to the movie's title, pointed to the climax.  I loved how, upon watching it again, I found many clues that I hadn't noticed before.  <br />My only complaint with the DVD is that there is no full screen version of the movie included.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie is about a man and how he changed his views and understanding of mankind while trying to make his way in life.<br />The setting is not light hearted and it follows into the severe atrocities committed against men, women and children without holding back.  If you tour the holocaust museum in D.C. you get even a deeper appreciation for what this man did to save the few under his care.<br />His list was truly the list of life, and this movie goes to great lengths to describe that to te viewer.  It flows well, and is quite shocking if you've never seen holocaust footage.  The actors have gone above and beyond to show the characters in their true light.<br />This is an epic that needs to be told over and over again.  &quot;Those that forget the past and condemned to repeat it.&quot;
B00012QM8G|2.0|Well, maybe not the worst. Disney's non-skippable previews take that prize. But here it is 2004 and this studio has *finally* released this epic film on an unnecessarily (GAG!) two-sided DVD packaged in (GAG!) cardboard. What's even worse than having to get up and flip the disc over in the middle of the film is that the stupid DVD won't default to the DTS sound track. It's got that insulting message that assumes we consumers don't know what DTS is. And on my first viewing, I realized 75% thru that I was no longer hearing the better DTS soundtrack after the flip. That was so annoying it just ruined the whole experience for me.
0060934913|3.0|I'd recommend a book by author Matt Lehman called &quot;Clam Chowder: A Server's Field Manual&quot;. This book is much more realistic, funny, clever and insightful. I couldn't put it down. I'm not sure if it's available on Amazon, but it is online at [...] <br />I haven't worked in the restaurant for years, but Clam Chowder brought back a flood of memories for me. I have read it twice since I first got it. My book has now been passed on to at least 7 other people. They all agree, Clam Chowder is the best restaurant book ever - told from a server's perspective.
0671015206|4.0|Charles Dickens (in David Copperfield) had it right:  \\"Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure nineteen six, result happiness.  Annual income twenty pounds, annual expenditure twenty pounds ought and six, result misery.\\"  Essentially, accumulating wealth is all about under-spending, and that's the central message of Stanley and Danko's very clear and readable book.  There are numerous references in the book to academic studies of wealth (written by the authors--a university professor and a former professor) that add meat to the common sense financial bones throughout the book; however, you don't need an understanding of higher math to comprehend the message of the studies.<br />If you don't appreciate how powerful the combination of regular saving, combined with time and compound interest, can be, then this book will open your eyes.<br />Chances are, however, that you may already appreciate the message of this book.  If so, you can buy the book and most likely still enjoy it.  However, since the authors will be preaching to (your) choir, this book may not change your world.  Those who really need to read this book are those who don't already appreciate the benefits of living well within their means and, as a result, greatly expanding their future means.  For example, if your children are teens, they could benefit greatly from the common sense financial wisdom that runs throughout this best-seller.  (Of course, your kids could listen to you, but sometimes they aren't especially eager to follow parental advice.)  I've given away many copies of this book (I don't have that many children), and a number of the recipients have taken the time to tell me how this book changed their outlook on spending and saving.<br />In a nuts-and-bolts sense, this book describes the most common characteristics of the wealthy (drawing on the authors' studies), their living habits, how and where they shop and buy homes, how they are employed, what sorts of chances in life they take(and don't take), and the long-term effects of adult childrens' continuing financial dependence on their parents.  (The last point could be an eye-opener for some.)<br />One of the authors (Stanley) has written a follow-on book, The Millionaire Mind, but I think The Millionaire Next Door is clearly the better of the two books.  All in all, it's a very worthy effort.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Everyone talks about their lesbianism, and the fact that they're teens. I could care less. I don't care if it's simply a ploy to get money. They could be 30 year old drag queens for all I care. I only listen to my CDs; I don't try to dig into the artists' lives. I don't watch MTV, and if I were to see these girls on the street, I'd not notice. <br />That being said, are these deep emotional songs? God no. Not even close. If the other reviews are correct, they don't even know the English they're singing. They're typical pop trash. <br />BUT, they're CATCHY typical pop trash. So, while I do appreciate deep, moving, poetic music, I also enjoy music that is simply fun. And this is, to me, fun. Good beat. Catchy chorus. I'd pity anyone that didn't like this band and happened to hear one of their songs, because it'd take you the rest of the day to scrape these songs out of your skull. <br />So, if you're one of those people that gets embarrassed by certain CDs in your collection, don't buy this. <br />If you pride yourself on meaningful music/lyrics, don't buy this. <br />If you could care less about these things and just listen to what you like, give it a shot. You might enjoy it.<br />And, of course, if you're the &quot;typical&quot; MTV viewer, the votes are in; you do love this lol.
0790729407|4.0|This takes place in early 20th century Ireland. Irish patriots staged the 1916 Easter Rebellion in Dublin that was defeated by the British. A civilian picks out the ringleaders to be shot by a firing squad. Eamon De Valera was spared because he was born in America. Michael Collins was an Irish patriot who worked for Irish independence. He speaks to a crowd about resistance to British rule. The Irish Constabulary attack the crowd to disperse them and club Collins. Men attack a police post by firing the thatch roof, the disarming the police as they emerge. A man follows him, then gives him information about a meeting of politicians. Can this man be trusted? [The dark scenes are a distraction.] Collins asks this source to get him into the Castle (the headquarters of the British rulers) so he can inspect their files. Collins asks his men to get complete files on British administrators. He wants a warning to be given to collaborators that they will be killed.<br /><br />The British arrest a suspect for questioning (by intensive means). One collaborator is shot in the streets! The police raid a house, men escape over the rooftops. [This reminds me of WW II movies about Nazi-occupied Europe.] The newspapers report the escape of Eamon De Valera. He wants recognition of Ireland by President Wilson. [Isn’t this an assumption?] A young boy warns the men of a police raid on the home where they stayed. A car bomb kills some English officials. The British send a new force to Ireland to fight the terrorists. [One man’s patriot is another man’s terrorist.] Violence continues. Churchill picked the elite of the British Secret Service to go after Michael Collins and his boys. They want a picture of Michael Collins. A servant collects papers from a wastepaper basket to provide confidential information. Collins plans an operation with a dozen men. None are to sleep at their usual place this night.<br /><br />Doyle, the source, is followed to a hotel; it is raided. Doyle is tortured to get information. That night men are killed. British troops attack a rugby match in a stadium, then machine gun the players and spectators! De Valera returns from America. There is a slim chance for talks with the British. There is a discussion about tactics and warfare. An attack on the Customs House fails, there is retribution. There is talk of a truce for negotiations between Ireland and England. Collins is chosen as a representative. [Nobody knows what he looks like.] There will be an Irish Free State, part of the British Empire. It’s the best they can do at this time. It’s a first step. This is not good news. There is conflict over this treaty which partitions the country. Collins says the alternative is a war for which they are not ready.<br /><br />The Treaty is passed by a narrow margin. This creates conflict among friends. In 1922 the Irish Army takes control of the government. The British flag is lowered, the Irish tricolor is raised. But a civil war breaks out between opposing factions (“The Troubles”). The Army is divided. Can fighting be prevented? Collins supports the treaty. A government building is shelled by artillery. Armored cars patrol the streets. [Have things changed?] The Army shoots at civilians who return fire; or the other way around. One man seeks shelter underground. There is a tragedy. There is a proposal for talks, it will take place outside Dublin. Will Collins go to Cork? Yes, in spite of the danger. He wants to stop the bloody mayhem. Collins awaits an answer; a meeting is arranged. But men prepare an ambush of the motorcade. Shots are exchanged, Collins falls, shot dead. Kitty hears the bad news, she will not need a wedding gown. Collins was age 31. There is a big funeral for him.<br /><br />I don’t know much about Irish history, I wonder what was omitted or added for drama. It’s a good story and worth watching. I read that Erskine Childers was shot in reprisal; later his son became President of Eire. Note how military power creates political power. That’s why 19th and 20th century aristocracy always wore uniforms to show their status.
B0000DIXDR|4.0|This is a coming of age story of naive Baby who comes with her family to a wealthy resort and falls in love with Johnny, the popular dance teacher. This is the summer that Baby grows up and falls in love. I really liked it, the &quot;dirty dancing&quot; wasn't that dirty, and it was pretty clean for the most part. <br />There were only a few instances where I can think that it was suggestive, otherwise it isn't too bad. There is also a gross scene where someone had a botched abortion and is suffering from the pain. Nothing gory but a young woman called Penny goes to get an abortion and its a botched one. She's seen laying on the bed groaning from the pain and some of the sheets are bloody, thankfully Baby gets her dad who's a doctor and he takes care of Penny and yes she lives. <br />Its disturbing, don't let young kids or young teens watch this movie. I don't get why they wanted to put this scene in unless its to show viewers the dangers of abortion. Johnny and Baby teach each other about life and love. I'm not sure if I liked this movie, I'm turned off by the abortion scene. I mean ugh, its so sad. The movie has a good plot and the whole cast did a wonderful job. There are lots of features in this movie so if you're a huge fan of the movie then I'd suggest that you get this dvd.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|\\"Lost in Translation\\" has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. I have no idea why so many people love it. It is horrible and full of bad acting. All Bill Murray does it sit there with a smirk on his face, which hardly constitutes a best actor nomination. You see the whole movie in the previews. The movie starts out with a 15min \\"BUTT\\" shot of Scarlett Johansson. The movie 2 hours of boredom and then when you get to the end of the movie you have no idea what happens. Bill whispers something in her ear and you have no idea what. You can't even guess at what he said because the story goes no where. All you can deduce form this movie is that Bill Murray hates his wife and cheats on her with the bar room singer, and Scarlett Johansson is mad that her boyfriend does not pay attention to her and decides go after bill Murray. The only thing this movie is good for is a scenic view of Japan; there are great shots of the city with in the film, and that's just about the only good shots. I am welcome to you comments on why you liked this movie.

B00014X8KO|5.0|From Katsuhiro Otomo (and others) comes three completely different stories. Each of them interesting and original in itself.<BR>MAGNETIC ROSE is about a couple of astronauts who investigate an old space station. It has the atmospheric mood of a traditional ghost story but is set in a science fiction like reality. This one immeadiately became one of my favorite pieces of animation that I have ever seen. Glorious hand drawn traditional animation with minimal but beatifully incorporated cgi elements where necesary.<BR>STINK BOMB is more of a funny story but definately a good one. A boy accidentaly swallows a pill that turns him into a biochemical weapon. As he unwillingly and unknowingly goes on a path of destruction through Tokyo the army deplores increasingly aggresive and desperate means to stop him, and as the story gradually grows in scope the viewer doesn't know wether to laugh at the silliness of it all or shudder at the realistic horror of biochemical warfare and it's consequences.<br />CANNON FODDER the final entry is probably my least favorite, although it does have a unique look and a refreshingly original story flow as the entire movie unfolds with very few and almost seemless cuts. The camera simply travels around from place to place never stopping, as we follow the lives of a family in a weird alternative reality (or possibly a grim future) where the inhabitans of a city full of giant cannons spend their entire existance firing shells at an unseen enemy.<BR>These are sort of like the short animations from projects such as &quot;Animatrix&quot; and &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; from the 80'ies only better. Each of them adds something new and brings a fresh idea forwards and it is a gem in any collection of anime. Here's hoping more projects like this one will see the light of day in the near future.
B00018TI5E|2.0|I'v been a moderate fan of RHCP and a huge fan of J.F. since the release of ToWaterOnly... and I can't describe how disappointed I am with his new album. Perhaps if I hadn't been waiting so long ... The new CD fits nowhere near the previous one in terms of creativity, atmosphere and uniqueness. The production is so mainstream that it could have been recorded by anybody. It lacks the previous album's haunting moods as the vocal has lost the dramatic texture (where did all the falsettos go?); the melodies are uninteresting and sound like some Beatles and Travelling Wilburies rip-offs. Not that I don't like these bands but I just don't see Frusciante as an mediocre imitator. I think the minimalistic drum + guitar + voice aesthetic served JF much better. When you really have something to say the meaning will find the way to your ear. When there's no freshness the whole production and editing and long pseudo-avant-garde electronic fill-ins won't help. To sum up, it's not a bad album - it just dramatically lacks depth.
B000008LOU|5.0|Well first off, its a real shame Roy passed away, but given this gigantic tragedy, the remaining Wilburys pumped out a real gem regardless. Bob and Tom take the majority of the Cd, and I believe *track for track* its actually slighter stronger than the first CD. Tracks like \\"Inside Out\\", \\"She's my baby\\", \\"The Devils Been Busy in Your backyard\\" are wonderful. There is no really weak points oin this Cd, and George in particluar is used beautifully, mainly in bridges-Tom and Bob seem to do most of the intial leads. What a roomful of talemts and we mustn't forget Jeff Lynne who I believe is a very, very talented producer, who knows how to maximise talent. But then again, with these legends, ther sure IS talent to burn!!!! :-) BTW folks, this was the first music I ever bought, (I had just gotten in Bob thru my parents old LP's) a tape way back in 1990, and it was a wonderful introduction. Beautiful music++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I liked this album a lot. Although the lyrics aren't as good as Tool's, this band really rocks! My favorite song on this album would definitely have to be &quot;BLUE&quot;. Maynard's voice really mixes well with the awesome guitar sounds. The single, &quot;WEAK AND POWERLESS&quot;, is also another one of my favorites. This is definitely a MUST BUY album!!
B0001CCXGG|4.0|Le set de Joe Satriani<BR>Joe offre une solide performance énergique, son set list est bien choisi....... excellent set<br />Le set de Steve Vai.<BR>Le set de steve est aussi exellent, la piece Reaping est vraiment très bonne, Steve use de tout son talent.... très bon set.<br />Le set d'Yngwie Malmsteen<BR>A mon avis c'est le moins bon des 3, pourtant je suis un fan d'Yngwie, son set list n'est pas bon, il aurait tellement dû choisir d'autres pieces tel Black Star!!<BR>Red house met un peu de couleur dans son set....<BR>Yngwie a trop voulu en mettre en y intégrant des solos interminables.<br />Le G3 jam<BR>Le jam des 3 virtuoses est excellent, un très bon mélange de  guitaristes, les 3 pièces du Jam sont bien adaptées et très bien jouées, quoi que un peu longue mais bon... le G3 jam  est ce que je préfère sur le cd.<br />L'ensemble du cd est très bon et est doté d'un excellent son pour un album live........un album pour les fans de virtuoses de guitares!
630469654X|5.0|Rutgur Hauer plays a night and Michelle Pfiffer plays his love.  They are cursed by a mean old Bishop who was in love with Isabeu (Pfiffer).  And when he found out about her and Navarre (Hauer), he cursed them so they would see each other no longer.  During the day time, she is doomed to be a hawk, and at night Navarre is doomed to live as a wolf.  And so it shall be untill their deaths.  But the 'ol Bishop forgot about the mouse.<br />The mouse being the nickname for Phillippe, Matthew Broderick's character.  A young thief locked up in the dungeons of Aquilla.  He manages to escape (being the first to do so) and is on the run from the soliders of Aquilla.  He is saved from the soldiers by Navarre, after NAvarre overhears him claim he escaped from the dungeon. Navarre has plans.<br />This is a really well-done movie and is fun and exciting to watch.  And it is one of the few movies out there now that has a really happy ending that will bring tears to your eyes and make you want to just start the movie over and watch it again.  Unlike a lot of peeople here, I think the soundtrack is kind of cool.  The &quot;disco-medival&quot; music, as they described it, is a little different, but really shows you how *fun* the movie is.  And it is fun to watch.  Plus this is back in the day when Miss Pfiffer wan't old and is nice to watch too.  You can find this movie pretty cheap anywhere, so do yourself a favour and buy it.  You won't be dissapointed.
0064400018|5.0|This book shows what it was like back in the 1800's. It tells when they had to travel by wagons and you couldn't go to town everyday. This is a GREAT book and I hope that everybody reads it. I recommend this especially to the people that lives in the cities because you see what the backwoods are like and how it is kind of today!!!
B000085RTZ|4.0|This is really good epic, fantasy metal.  There seems to be some sort of weird medevial take on Faust, for the story line.  It's hard to decipher what is going on, even when sitting down and reading the lyrics.  But that doesn't make the music bad.  No way, its really good, everything sounds all epic and good.  <br />Center of the Universe is my favourite track right now.  Pick this one up.  All the music is there, the lyrics, and the concept.  Instead of wasting your cash on has beens like Incubus or those &quot;the&quot; bands, get this.  A band that takes a medival city and buts a K in front of it.  wee!
B00013F38K|5.0|This was a great show but racism in the 'olden days' in hiring David Carradine and not Bruce Lee??  Just about every week the show was about the evils of racism and discrimination.  I thought the character of Caine was half Chinese and half American and he looked that way to me.  Just about all of the racist characters in the show were white male cowboys.  Why would the show pick a main character because they were racist and then do a show against racism???  I'm buying it as soon as it is available.
B000000OQF|5.0|Appetite for destruction would be on my top 50 albums ever. Every song on it is great from The opening song welcome to the jungle which is awsome then to its so easy - i love how it starts fast then goes into more slow paced sound then starts fast again, then out to get me , good rythum ,and the rest are all excellent songs , mr. brownstone, paradise city, my michelle, think about you , sweet child of mine, youre crazy, anything goes and rocket queen - they all meld perfectly into one another to make a great rock/ metal album and to the reveiewer who said the nu metal bands are better- guns n roses is the better than all of them and they cant even compare. Overall great cd/should be in your collection.
B00004R7X5|2.0|Karajan is often criticized for the homogenized sound of his later recordings, yet he made some exceptional ones during his long career. The beauty of the string playing in this recording of Scheherazade is certainly appealing, and the violin solos are gorgeous, as others have noted. <br />This well-loved music based loosely on the Arabian Nights is redolent with innocence, wonder and mystery. It has earned its place among the most popular classical works ever written. However, Karajan pulls and nudges at lines throughout, distorting the dramatic flow of Rimsky-Korsakov's score and, especially in the inner movements, the sense of magic that makes Scheherazade so engaging is thereby lost.<br />More problematic is the brass. The unpolished play is evident in Scheherazade, but is so sloppy and disjointed in the other two pieces on the disc that those works are seriously marred. Even those unfamiliar with the music will notice the miscues, the undisciplined honking and braying. Other reviewers have already mentioned further problems with the Tchaikovsky pieces.<br />Overall, it is difficult to recommend this disc, even at mid-price. The Penguin Guide remarks that this is not one of Karajan's best. There are many competitive recordings available that would be more satisfying. The recording by Mackerras with the London Symphony is very well done, with excellent Telarc sound. The recording by Serebrier with the same orchestra on Reference Recordings offers state-of-the-art sonics and is coupled with a very fine performance of Rimsky-Korsakov's compelling Russian Easter Overture.
B00008977N|2.0|I probably would have bought this DVD even after reading the reviews, but I too thought that with all the differing opinions that it was a case of &quot;operator error&quot; and differing equipment. I was wrong. <br />(Please note that this review is primarily about the VIDEO TRANSFER ONLY - I too have been waiting for a pristine DVD version of this concert after enjoying the VHS for so long. The magic of the performance almost draws your attention away from the horrid transfer, but if you are a video-phile, it will drive you up a wall! Maybe the best advice has already been given - look at it as a decent 5.1 DVD-audio disc and call it a wash!)<br />I too work in the &quot;video biz&quot; (I'm an editor) and cannot believe how awful this transfer is. Yes, the concert was originally shot on film. I have no real explanation as to why the transfer is so bad. Perhaps it was not originally anamorphic? (What really bothers me is the label on the packaging promising a &quot;16x9 remastered Anamorphic transfer.&quot; What a joke.) The &quot;film grain&quot; look is not the fault of the original material. It is simply a bad transfer/compression to the DVD format. When you watch any theatrical anamorphic movie you don't complain about &quot;film grain&quot; right? Apparently PG isn't quite as &quot;technologically savvy&quot; as we are all led to believe. Either that or he just has no control over this stuff. <br />Either way, this DVD will dissappoint anyone who is enjoying the thrills of HDTV. As someone mentioned in one review, the Bruce Springsteen in NY is the video standard by which all DVD concerts must be compared. I understand that Bruce was shot in native High Def, but my copy of the '70s B-horror movie &quot;Frogs&quot; is a better film transfer than Secret World. For a filmed concert comparison, watch PG/SWL and then watch the Criterion DVD of Gimme Shelter. It was shot in the late '60s on film and the transfer is absolutely incredible! I had such high expectations while unwrapping this disc and the moment I hit the play button I knew that I had thrown away $16.99 and would seldom watch this disc again. Just too painful.<br />Are we suppose to be waiting for the &quot;special edition&quot; of Secret World Live? Silly me, I thought this was IT!<br />A very big dissappointment from a very great artist.
B00012QM8G|3.0|The folks at Universal could have used a man like Oskar &quot;The Presentation, that's what I'm good at&quot; Schindler to oversee the release of this DVD.  As it is, I agree with my fellow reviewers, that somebody dropped the ball in putting together this DVD release. It could be worse - some genius could have tried to cram the entire 3hr, 16min film onto a single side of one disc. Warner's &quot;JFK&quot; is the only 3hr+ movie that I've seen on DVD that gets away with putting the entire movie on a single-sided dual-layered disc and not suffer serious quality/presentation issues.  The theatrical versions of the Lord of the Rings films tried this and (compared to the special edition releases (which are spread out over two discs)) suffer the consequences.  <br />And because the film is spread out over two-sides of a disc, once one gets past the &quot;on-the-cheap&quot; DVD particulars, the film looks fabulous on any widescreen TV in progessive scan.  Never has the film looked this good - somebody cleaned this sucker up nicely.  And for the time being, that's good enough for me even though the extras - while touching - are less than fulfilling for a movie buff.  Five star movie, five-star video quality, two-star DVD production.
B00005JLZN|1.0|I would like to start off by saying that if you have yet to see this movie you may not want to read my review. In order to discuss a movie, in which the biggest flaw is the plot, requires that I discuss the plot.<br />The biggest problem with this film is that it tries way to hard to impress and ultimately falls completely flat. The movie's attempts to convince us that Kevin Spacey is completely innocent are ruined as soon as you wonder why the hell it took him so long to get someone to help clear his name. Spacey claims that he just wants his son to know that he was innocent, but is willing to die. A logical person would realize that it might be better to actually be released for you crime and then go see your son, but Winslett's character lacks any and all logic so she buys the story. Perhaps I'm too cynical but if the Usual Suspects has taught me anything, it's that Kevin Spacey is EVIL.  <br />My next big complaint is the fact that Winslett's attempt to save Spacey is thwarted by her car over-heating. Her car had over-heated earlier in the film and the cruel hand of fate saw to it that it over-heat at the exact moment she was trying to save a life; what irony! Worse yet is how melodramatic this scene is; I actually broke out laughing at this part of the film. <br />The last swerve in the film is so incredibly inane that it's almost impossible to find the right wording to insult, but I'll try. So, Spacey's dead and Winslett feels bad because she wasn't able to save him. A package arrives for her containing another videotape, which reveals that Spacey was all a part of the suicide to make a political statement about the death penalty. Let me get this straight; Spacey is fine with everyone knowing that he died to make a point so long as they don't know that he was in on it? So he then sends a tape to a reporter proving that he was? Huh? Well, maybe that's not the case; maybe he sent it just for her benefit. But then that raises this important question: what's the point of that? He's dying but for some reason he wants to shock the reporter that tried to save him?<br />The Life Of David Gale tries way too hard to swerve you, and as a result you can figure out the ending about half way through it.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|One reviewer below mentions Chekhov, which I thought was incredibly apt.  I'd also throw out Winesburg Ohio and Dubliners.  Even if nothing much happens plot-wise, works of art can still trigger a powerful emotional response.  (What's the &quot;story&quot; in a Rembrandt?)  If you've ever experienced inexplicable melancholy, then this movie is for you.  If not, then it's not.
0823003035|4.0|I bought this book a few weeks ago.  Agree that this book is not for beginners looking for &quot;formulas.&quot;  Ryder is basically just using that good-old, erase and redraw until it looks right method, which is the only way to go for high realism anyway if you ask me. This book was most useful to me as shading reference material since I draw from imagination mostly.  The book needs some more poses to be a better reference guide, but that may not be a major goal of the book, although it should be.  Beautiful models, beautifully modeled.  A great book to get you motivated to try harder for sure.
B000000H66|5.0|The best metal album of all time, possibly the best album.  This album is more than just music, but a philosophy.  Chuck Shuldiner,CHUCK RIP...died recently of brain cancer. sends out great messages to troubled youth.  His words of wisdom, especially in songs like 'perennial quest' and 'sacred serenity' has changed my life for the better. He preaches the importance of life and realizations of spiruality.  Great Riffs in 'without judgement'. TIMELESS, even if metal in 50 years is gone this album will be talked about!!  Jazz fusion musicians could learn a lot listening to this.
0763619612|5.0|Reynolds does a fantastic job showing how someone can be creative or artistic and not even know it.  I picked up this book at an elementary book fair first because I thought it was well written and illustrated.  Second because I want to help my children realize they have hidden talents.  And third because my husband is an art teacher in high school and his students are constantly telling him they can't draw.  <br />This book not only teaches that anyone can be artistic but it teaches that creativity is not something only some of us are born with - it is something we all have inside of us, we just need to find a little bit of inspiration to bring it out.  In Vashti's case, it was her teacher framing her dot and hanging it by her desk.<br />I recommend this book for anyone:  kids, adults, teenagers.
0064407667|1.0|Lemony Snicket's The Bad Beginning is the first in the Series of Unfortunate Events, and it chronicles the bad beginning of the unfortunate events of the newly-orphaned Baudelaire siblings.  I expected at least the level of intelligence represented in the Boxcar Children, but was confronted with a self-congratulatory narrator who talks down to his target audience, frequently stopping to define words for his woefully misinformed readers.  I found the tone entirely too self-aware, taking away from the story.<br />And what little story there was!  Unbelievable, one-dimensional characters coloured this book, which was about three orphans who had just lost their parents, and faced a horrible relative who was after their family fortune.  The whole thing reminded me of the cackling villain tying his female captive to the rail in old silent movies -- Count Olaf had no motivation besides the money, and (predictably) exploited and endangered the children without remorse to get it.  None of the characters showed any \\"real\\"  emotion (Snicket in fact seems completely uncomfortable with emotion), not even the children when facing the sudden deaths of their parents.  The book might as well have had \\"TO BE CONTINUED\\" stamped on the final page after a truncated sentence for all the ominous \\"foreshadowing\\" it forced down the reader's throat.<br />Total trash.  Whoever allowed this to be published should be ashamed.
B000127LW2|5.0|Voyager was my favorite of all the Star Trek series, and I've waited three years for this DVD set. This series started out with a bang, with the characters meshing immediately. The writing for Voyager was always top shelf. The extra features make this collection more interesting (especially when you see the producers' FIRST PICK for the character Janeway!) Believe me, it wouldn't have been the same show without Kate Mulgrew.<BR>All in all, I'd say this is as well done as it gets.
B00000GAIW|5.0|I agree with all the reviews, this is JT's crowned jewel.  What nobody seems to notice is the sound quality.  This so-called &quot;remaster&quot; falls in the category of rip-offs that many labels are re-issuing in order to attract the music purist seeking the best sound.  The quality of this re-issue is questionable for various reasons, while it offers slightly increased overall volume and a little more bass, the highs were compromised.  I made a track-by-track comparison with my older Chrysalis CD and came to the conclusion that many of the instruments, except bass, sound sharper in the older release.  I can't recommend purchasing this re-issue to anyone looking for a true remastered recording.  The bonus tracks were a nice inclusion, but to me they were just icing on poorly mixed cake.
B000069AUI|5.0|Just...wow. I first thought that this CD wasn't any good, but my friend let me listen to one of the songs and I just thought it was amazing. This CD truly rocks, seriously. The songs are long too, which I like. Great CD, I recommend it, and tell your friends! Just touching!
B000002LQR|5.0|Great grooves.  This is RHCP at their very best.  I listened to this album in 92-94 almost every day.  Presently, I still listen to the cd every once in a while, only a few cds from that era has that kind of impact on me.
0385504209|1.0|This book is for the weak minded, easily entertained lot. I found it boring, contrived, at times cheesy/hokey, and very poorly written. Everything needs to be explained to the point where the text loses its momentum. The villains are laughable, the way the main characters figure things out is so damn contrived that I found myself laughing out loud. People who are getting mad about how it goes against the Catholic Church and all this other nonsense, I have one thing to say to them: Don't bother! It's a waste of breath! This book is so bad that it really doesn't challenge your religion at all!<br />I honestly hated it, and find it sad to see that it is such a monster best-seller
B00006SFLV|5.0|This DVD is AMAZING. I almost cannot put into words my feelings about this show. I was too young to enjoy it when it premiered but I have fallen in love with it upon watching the dvd. It is brilliantly written and acted. My only complaint with the dvd is that it doesn't have any extras and that there never was a second season. The dvd makes you long for answers. My So-Called Life is intense. It doesn't seem fair that such an amazing show would have such a short shelf life.<br />I highly recommend this dvd to anyone who sees TV as an art form. It will touch you in so many ways.
B0000U5RO4|2.0|Johnny English is a tired comedy, with stale and predictable gags.  Consider the following example of outrageously unfunny verbal wit: \\"I think I'd rather have my bottom impaled on a giant cactus than exchange pleasantries with that jumped up Frenchman,\\" says Johnny, unknowing that the 'jumped up Frenchman' is standing right behind him.  It doesn't even raise the ghost of a smile.  Rowan Atkinson should resign himself to the fact that his metier is as the silent Mr. Bean.<br />The film begins well enough, with an amusing daydream sequence, where Johnny English - pen-pusher at M17 (comic cousin of Britain's M15 spy agency) fantasises about his dangerous, dashing life if he were the notoriously brilliant Agent One.  When Agent One, and the entire M17 spy corps are killed - through English's blunders - his dream becomes reality.  It is up to him to save England from the machinations of a megalomaniac Frenchman, who wishes to claim the British throne and turn the country into a massive prison. <br />With a plot and characters like these, there is obviously the potential for Johnny English to be a humorous Bond-spoof, but the potential remains largely inactivated.  There are occasional moments of genuine mirth, such as a hearse being chased by a tow truck, and the subsequent scene in the graveyard, but these are few and far between.  The jokes are signposted a mile off, and include juvenile toilet humour.  One does get the impression the scriptwriters were rather low on inspiration and in the resultant morass, one joke is even utilised twice.  Ironically, the funniest moment of the movie is tacked on part way through the end credits, by which time most of the audience will have switched off in disappointment.
0385474547|5.0|In a piece of folk music you can smell the raw earth of the region of its origin, in a folk tale you will find the dreams and passions and pathos of the people of that land, in a folk lore you will find the history and philosphy that embodies the region. This book, by Chinua Achebe, is all three combined in addition to being a clinical yet sensitive documentation of the social evolution of the Nigerian rural society. With the poet's scalpel he dissects the inevitable Colonisation by the European settlers, causing the havoc in the thousand years old way of living in the heart of Africa. You can smell the air, taste the food, sway to the music, feel the weather, and hear the battle cry of the old simple philosphy of a civilisation locked in a time warp fighting a losing battle against the more powerful and supposedly evolved avatar of itself, transferred from a foreign land. This book exemplifies the notion that all great stories are simple, their complexity and greatness lies in their simplicity, their appeal never becomes stale even after repeated readings, rather new facets, new imagery crop up everytime it's re-read, and the book is discovered anew.    The characterisations are perfect, with the protagonists acting as the chief motifs of the physical, emotional and philosophical framework of the Nigerian social structure, and through their evolution the author narrates the progression of the society through the tumultuous era of the European colonisation. A must read for anyone vagualy interested in the life of the people on this earth, and how we have evolved and are continuously doing so, throughout history, for man, despite the vast geographical differences, is the same in essence, and this timeless fact is epitomized in this piece of literature.
0451169514|5.0|IT is the second best book by my favorite author. A lot of people call King 'One of the best authors living'. IT starts out with the death of Bill's brother Georgie. Now we flash forward to 1985 where another string of murders of children have begun again, 27 years later after the Loser's defeated IT. Now it has come back! Mike Hanlon is one of the Losers who stayed in Derry while the others went their own ways that one hot summer in 1958. Bill is now a famous horror-writer, Richie is a famous talk show radio host, Ben is a aratech (I know I spelled it wrong, so sue me), Bevelery is married to a abusive husband but designs clothes, Eddie is a limo driver known for driving huge celebrities around town, Mike is the local librarian, Stan owns his own business (I cant remember, so SUE ME!). Mike then gives them a call telling them that IT has come back. So now, they come back to Derry to talk about IT and how they can destroy it for good. So now King then takes us back to 1958 and 1985. <BR> As the book moves along, they each discover IT in their own adventures alone, and they band together to figh IT. Now not only do they have to worry about Pennywise (IT), they have to worry about Henry, and his friends Belch, and his other friend. They pick on them throughout the summer, and they discover IT when they follow them to the sewer where the Loser's face it for the first time in 1958. So now, back in 1985, they go back down there, and they kill Pennywise in his orginial form: a HUGE spider! So now they kill IT, and the end. <br />So why is this one of his best books? King writes a lot, and he has written more than 30 books in this 30 year career. So now, as he slows down as he gets older, Pennywise comes back through the Dark Tower which is a good series. So now, if you are reading this, read IT and prepare to get scared and have a good time with IT.

B00013PHGS|1.0|I'll always have a level of respect for AIR because of the sound they pioneered on Moon Safari. Much of the stuff out today wouldn't even exist if it weren't for the influence Moon Safari had on the electronic scene. But these guys have not made anything since that has come close. Talkie Walkie is just way too esoteric, aimless and ultimately pointless. There's little to grasp on to, little about the album that is memorable. I'm a big fan of melody, and you won't find much of it in Talkie Walkie, just a lot of sonic experimentation and &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; for the sake of pushing the envelope meandering. Let's be honest, if you blindfolded their fans and played the album for them, they would probably say it sucks if they didnt' know it was AIR. Like Beck or Bjork, AIR has carved out such a niche following that their core fans are going to eat up whatever they do, unquestionably, be it crap or not.<br />The one exception to me is Cherry Blossom Girl. An absolutely gorgeous song I cannot stop listening to. That is AIR at its best, and that's the AIR that I think has been lost since Moon Safari.
B0000DD7NL|1.0|This is WAY TOO OVERRATED just like some smart people think.  Alicia Keys thinks she is the best but just as bad if not worse than all these other r&amp;B and popo singers out their making a fortune for petty work on AWFUL albums that many people buy for weird reasons!  Listen to Billy Idol or some 80's music instead.
B00004W221|5.0|From the time he was a young boy, everyone had told Rudy Ruettiger (Sean Astin) that he was too small, too weak, and not smart enough to accomplish his ultimate goal - to play football for Notre Dame. Discouraged, he shelves his dream and follows his father and brothers to work in a steel mill. Only one person, Rudy's best friend Pete, actually has faith in him. When Pete is killed in a freak accident four years later, something in Rudy is reawakened, and he realizes that if he's ever going to be happy in life, he needs to play football. He needs to go to Notre Dame. But he doesn't have the grades to get in. We see Rudy do everything in his power, for several long semesters, to gain admission to the prestigious school.<br />But getting into Notre Dame isn't his only problem. Once in, he has to get on the team - no mean feat for someone who, in the words of the maintenance man Fortune (Charles S. Dutton), is &quot;five-foot nothin', a hundred and nothin',&quot; and has &quot;no speck of athletic ability.&quot; And even after he's on the team, there's no guarantee that he'll actually get to dress for a game. In the end, however, the results of Rudy's persistence and hard work are more than he could ever have imagined.<br />&quot;Rudy&quot; is a touching true story of the power of hope and hard work. It is a football movie, but it is also so much more than that. Rudy's steadfastness is very moving to see, and Sean Astin captures the character beautifully. I think this is Astin's best performance, transcending even Samwise Gamgee in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (it's a close call though). The supporting cast members are just as perfectly fitted to their roles. Charles S. Dutton turns in a great performance as Fortune, ultimately Rudy's best mentor, and Robert Prosky plays Father Cavanaugh, the priest at Notre Dame who offers Rudy a chance to improve his grades at a nearby junior college, whereby he just might have a shot at admission.<br />The soundtrack to the film is perfectly fitted. It puts the final cap on many an emotional scene. This Special Edition DVD offers an isolated music score, letting you listen to the music alone. The DVD has some other nice bonus features as well: &quot;Rudy: The Real Story&quot; is a short documentary on the real Rudy Ruettiger, with commentary from the man himself. It is touching to see Ruettiger talk about his experiences, and one can see that Sean Astin did a magnificent job conveying him to the screen. There is also a &quot;Production&quot; featurette, briefly outlining the making of the movie, and finally &quot;60 Seconds With Sean Astin&quot; features the actor giving us some quick commentary on the film. There are also Talent Files on the director and actors.<br />&quot;Rudy&quot; is one of the most inspirational sports movies I've ever seen. The fact that it is a true story makes it all the more amazing. If you enjoy films like &quot;Remember the Titans&quot; (with Denzel Washington), you'll love &quot;Rudy&quot; (and if you like &quot;Rudy&quot; but haven't seen &quot;Remember the Titans,&quot; I recommend that one as well). This is a wonderful movie for anyone, whether you're a football fan or not (I'm not). It is emotional and moving, but never goes over the top.

0316666343|4.0|This was one of the best books I've ever read. I am so interested in this type of stuff, not the rape- but the spiritual essence. It's definatly worth reading!
B000068OSK|4.0|Though the White Stripes claim to not want to evolve as a band, preferring to stay at their primitive and awesome level, you really can see how they've grown a bit since this very cool first album. Jack's voice has smoothed out and become a bit more versatile, and the lyrics have gotten a little better, even though this disc has some nice ones. Great guitar riffs, and my favorite Meg-drumming of any White Stripes CD! Kind of a wacky album, Jack's voice somewhat tests the boundaries of listenability but doesn't cross the line and stays quirkily expressive. Very catchy in every way, it grows on you!<br />Jimmy the Exploder-- Simple, childlike, but energetic and passionate so that it's fun.<BR>Stop Breaking Down-- Robert Johnson cover, maybe my favorite song on the CD. Love the drumming.<BR>The Big 3 Killed My Baby-- Impassioned and raw (gee, what's new?) Jack's protest song, very cool.<BR>Suzy Lee-- Johnny Walker of the Soledad Brothers assists with slide guitar. Cool song.<BR>Sugar Never Tasted So Good-- Weird, but nice.<BR>Wasting My Time-- Dramatic breakup song. Fun to sing along with!<BR>Cannon-- &quot;Tell me who's that writin'? John the Revelator!&quot; <BR>Astro-- So catchy it's ridiculous, makes you want to do a Frankenstein-style dance<BR>Broken Bricks-- Another of my favorites. Frantic, almosts swing-dance style. I like the cowbell sound in it as well!<BR>When I Hear My Name-- Almost too short to be a song, but I've felt just like the lyrics of it (all two of them, heh)<BR>Do-- Really fun to play on guitar. Hard to describe, but fab.<BR>Screwdriver-- Most awesome of guitar riffs. Intense vocal delivery, Very cool!<BR>One More Cup of Coffee-- All hail Dylan! Great cover!<BR>Little People-- Slightly annoying, but the inexplicable sound in the background makes it more interesting.<BR>Slicker Drips-- An OK song, not my favorite.<BR>St. James Infirmary-- So different from the rest of the album, it has silent movie piano and slightly scat vocals. How cool can youget?<BR>I Fought Pirahnas-- More slide guitar. A nice ending!
B0000027I6|4.0|I have to be honest, sometimes Roger Waters' lyrics just are annoying at times and can be used as tool to mock him. As he croaks &quot; Old timer who you gonna kill next?&quot; Some will believe he will if he would just shut up! It can be a hard time taking his views seriously<br />But that's the whole deal with Waters - you either love him or you hate him. There's nothing inbetween really. I must say I hated this album on first listen. Mocking his voice, some of his lyrics and so on. But given time my opinion has changed. It's nowhere near the greats that he produced with Pink Floyd but you should never expect him to do that.<br />What we get here from Waters is the essential mix of all that he hates about the modern world and TV is the main ingredient. This would be a boring exercise in tedium had it not had the one thing needed to boost this - humour! And there is a fair bit of it here but only if you consider Roger's particular sense of humour funny. It's particularly caustic and probably wouldn't seem very funny to some politically correct conscious people but what do you expect?<br />Highlighting songs is useless because they're to all gel as one really and not otherwise. Although towards the end the songs tend to drag on a little ( hence the 4 stars ) but overall this is a good album and possibly the only Roger Waters album you need if you aren't particularly bothered by the rest
0385504209|2.0|..Why call a Yugo a Mercedes ?<br /> My biggest question is why the massive praise for Dan Brown's  &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; ? (or Angels and Demons ?) I read them both, and they are nothing more or less than a typical, mediocre &quot;summer beach novel&quot; that contains extensive lessons (can you say boring ?) on Catholicism...from the actual religious functions to the museums, art and the architectures that hold the art, and how the architectures that hold the art came about, and the architecs who built them, when they built them and what drew them to architecture in the first place, and how the art wound up in that particular architecture. etc. WHEW ! I don't even consider this man a good writer, but he's one heck of a  teacher who's obsessed with Catholicism and it's culture. Sure, he throws in a few bad guys...a little science.....a few gruesome murders...a secret society here and there, but his his paper-thin, cliched and utterly ridiculous stories are nothing but padding so he can write about his vast knowledge of all things Catholic (and expensive Catholic art). He never &quot;puts you there&quot; with his many long winded descriptions of his settings, he simply comes across as a teacher who's telling you what he learned or saw, and this becomes extremely boring and irritating to me. Before you deny this, think ! Consider the shallow and cliched stories of these two books, which possess one of the most monumentally cliched lead characters I've ever encountered .....now, consider the major lessons on Catholicism you were dealt....and how they make up the bulk of the book. Am I wrong ? If the reader finds this type of novel fun, thrilling, intelligent or informative, then that's great. But, I don't like all the media exclaiming &quot;masterpiece,&quot; &quot;absolutely stunning,&quot; &quot;the best of the best&quot; &quot;genius,&quot; etc., when this author is basically on par with James Patterson. Yep, that's right.  I would much rather read a non-fictional book from Brown on his knowledge of art and architecture, than to ever suffer through another of his fictional, supposed thrillers, which he LOVES to saturate with facts in order to sucker the reader into believing they are reading something &quot;special&quot;.ctional book from Brown on his knowledge of art and architecture, than to ever suffer through another of his fictional, supposed thrillers, which he LOVES to saturate with facts in order to sucker the reader into believing they are reading something &quot;special&quot;.
0385312083|5.0|Billy Pilgrim has come unstuck in time.  One of my new favorite books ever!  Truly one of Vonnegut's best works of art.  Deep and profound with many allusions to keep you guessing.  So it goes...
0393325172|4.0|I saw the movie and decided to try the books. Very little of this book (only two items) is in the movie. This means you get an episodic book without the strong plot of the movie.<br />However, it remains rewarding reading. The writing is excellent; the characters are complex, and the detail (I presume) is correctly rendered. I'm no nautical history buff, but the parts of the ship that I didn't understand didn't get in the way of the story.<br />The character of Jack Aubrey is drawn very well. In spite of being a hero, he's shown as a man with self-doubt and sometimes (especially on land) not knowing how to behave. The same level of detail goes for Stephen Maturin, the ship's doctor and Aubrey's friend, who has a closer grasp on the ways of the world yet is hardly a sailor.<br />O'Brian puts you on a British frigate in the early 1800s. I felt that it was a very convincing picture that he painted. Although Master and Commander is not the book you expect (especially if your introduction was the movie), it kept my attention enough for me to try more of O'Brian's work.
B00005LC4B|2.0|Even though there are some VERY strong performances here, it doesn't create the tension of the original. Worse, the ending has been changed!! <br />Stick to the original.
0385121679|5.0|I love reading and one of my teachers said that I would live Stephen King. So I went out and got The Shining. I think this is a great book. I tould all my friends that it was a great book and some of them went out and got it. I do not think kids under 8th grade should read Stephen king book. So read this book.
0441009425|1.0|I was excited after reading the positive reviews for this book, and after reading the first few pages.  But by page 150 I realized that I no longer cared what happened next.  The characters are incredibly dull and one-dimensional.  I also was frustrated by the fact that there seemed to be no logic in what the author chose to describe at length, versus what was hardly described at all.  Relatively unimportant objects where described in detail, while more important objects were hardly described or explained at all.  Skip this one.
B000089RVX|5.0|Ive heard only parts of the cd. But the song &quot;bring me to live&quot; i cant stop listening to it. in the car, at home, even at a friends i download it. the amy is wonderful at singing this. even driving from dallas to ft worth for work, i listen to the song over and over. something about that song that puts a person in a trance. but in shorter terms, i recomend this cd to anyone. no matter the mood theyre in, it helps. trust me. it works
B0000DD7LB|5.0|if you don't already own this album, you don't know what you're missing!  this is the best pop album i've ever listened to and i highly suggest you run out and get it!  literally all 13 tracks are great and they never become old or tired after repeated listens.  the music, vocals, lyrics, and production are all stellar and i'm sure you'll feel the same if you give this album a chance.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Let's get to the point right away - this 2nd album by Dire Straits is not better than their debut. Particularly, because the songs are not so good. But yet it calmly flows along just fine, provides a handful of beautiful melodies, a striking guitar playing by Mark Knopfler, and all in all proves to be a 5 star record.<br />The sound of this album is made with 2 major influences. One, is that the band clearly wanted to make an album in the vein of their first. It gets very obvious in a number of songs, which sound like a rehash of songs from &quot;Dire Straits&quot; with different lyrics. This album starts with almost the same lone guitar licks, and ends in the same style with very calm and relaxed song (&quot;Lions&quot; in the debut and &quot;Follow Me Home&quot; here). &quot;Where Do You Think You're Going?&quot; is not without a taste of &quot;Six Blade Knife&quot;. &quot;Lady Writer&quot; borrows a lot from &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;. But what the album lacks in originality, it gains back in soul with which this songs are performed. Another influence I'm talking of is Hawaiian. This album was recorded in the studio in Hawaii, and it shows in positive relaxed feeling to some songs, like &quot;Communique&quot;, &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot;, and gets to the most notable form in &quot;Follow Me Home&quot;.<br />Along with this tropical feeling, the band introduced keyboards to their sound, that first can be heard in &quot;Where Do You Think You're Going?&quot;. History proved it was a step in the right direction.<br />While this record doesn't hold your attention like &quot;Dire Straits&quot; does, I tend to judge it positively, because typically for Mark, it's done very tastefully. My favorite songs here are &quot;News&quot;, &quot;Where Do You Think You're Going?&quot;, &quot;Lady Writer&quot; and &quot;Single-Handed Sailor&quot;. This album will be a good addition to any blues-rock fan collection. And Mark Knopfler's guitar playing is incredible, like it always was.
185984054X|3.0|The very first book I ever reviewed on Amazon was this one.  At the time I had never heard of Chris Hitchens and doubted his motives.  <br />I now am very familar with him and his opinions and looking at this book a 2nd time come to the following conclusions:<br />Hitchens has as always written an honest book as in my review of many years past I don't dispute the facts he details<br />Hitchens is not convinced of a vast Vatican conspericy as I thought he is instead the classic anti-theist.  He has no use for religion and his conclusions of Mother Teresa stem from that.<br />The Basic arguement of the book is Mother Teresa is no saint because she is more interested in Catholic doctrine and belief then the care of the poor and furthermore put those doctrines ahead of her mission.  He is quite correct.<br />However he forgets that #1  without that belief none of the good done by her and the sisters would have been done, and #2.  As a believing and devout Catholic if she put the work ahead of her belief then she would be sinning.  This is not only biblical (He who loves mother or Father more than me is not worthy of me) but best addressed in Lewis's SCREWTAPE LETTERS #23 &quot;...we do want and want very much to make men treat Christianity as a means...a means to anything --even to social justice...the Enemy (God) will not be used as a convenience.&quot;<br />Much like his view of Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ the idea that the worship or belief in Christ as the primary cause for an action makes it less whole.  If you believe religion is a waste of time then you will agree with both views.  If you are a believer in Christ you will not.<br />Either way the book is worth reading.  If only for the fact is is the only contrary view of Mother out there and is a more honest view than any other critic would give.
B00005MIIX|5.0|Don't be fooled by the post before me, this is in fact the same mix that is available in the States. Bill Whitely must be referring to the original '87 cd release of WOIIFTM.

B0001FR3IQ|3.0|I was very curious to see Gothika as all My friends did recommend me , BUT their recommendation was out of Watching the Trailer ONLY...and that's totally different than watching the movie it self...<BR>first,The movie isn't that bad , but it's not that good , The plot isn't new, actually it's built on the success of Other movies like ( WHAT LIES BENEATH )..actually all i was thinking of while watching Gothika was ( What Lies BENEATH )..some scenes were almost matching in the two movies..AND THAT WAS TOTALLY NEGATIVE FOR GOTHIKA to repeat a plot that was just used 4 or 5 years ago..Still i won't tell you the story of gothika as most of reviewers already did, plus i'd like you to see it your self and find out the matching between the two movies.<BR>Then, the positive thing About Gothika , Halle Berry did her part Good , but i still wonder why she did accept such rule and the same question for Robert Downey JR. ..<BR>The direction of photography is great ..the camera moves very smoothly ..<br />At the End , watching this Movie would make me recommend to you watching ( WHAT LIES BENEATH ) if you still haven't seen it...and Gothika , well, you won't die if you just ignored watching it..and if watched it you won't be scared to death :)
0671027387|5.0|When a Nasa satellite discovers an astonishingly rare object buried deep in the Arctic ice, the floundering space agency proclaims a much-needed victory--a victory with profound implications for NASA policy and the impending presidential election. To verify the authenticity of the find, the White House calls upon the skills of the intellegence analyst Rachel Sexton. Accompanied by a team of experts, including the charmismatic scholar Michael Tolland, Rachel travels to the Arctic and uncovers the unthinkable: evidence of scientific trickery--a bold deception that threatens to plunge the world into controversey. But before she can warn the President, Rachel and Michael are ambushed by a deadly team of assassins. Fleeing for their lives across a desolate and lethal landscape, their only hope for survival is to discover who is behind this masterful plot. The truth, they will learn, is the most shocking deception of all...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|As someone who has been to Japan on business trips, I was looking forward to seeing this movie and comparing it to my experience there.  Although there is much about this movie that I did relate to in terms of the scenery and the feeling of overstimulation when out on the streets, overall I came away dissapointed.  First, while the premise of the movie sounds like a good idea, overall the film is poorly executed.  The dialog is neither engaging, insightful, or witty.  Because of this, I really did not think that the main characters had that much chemistry.  And what is up with Scarlett Johansson pracing around in her underwear and a sweater for the entire movie?? Calling wardrobe please!  The movie creeps along for the entire time, making it seem much longer than it is.  Also, the portrayal of the Japanese characters are one dimensional, insulting, and often painful to watch (Think of Mickey Rooney's character in &quot;Breakfast at Tiffanys&quot;, the low point of an otherwise great movie).<br />I really do not understand the other reviews that praise this movie as some great achievement in filmmaking.  I can only guess that those reviews must be all of the wannabe screenwriters and directors out there who find hope in the fact that an amateurish film can do so well at the box office.  Guess what: You can write and direct a film like this, as almost anyone can. The problem is you just don't have the name Coppola and the Hollywood connections to pull it off.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is by far the best cd I own, and a great intro to Nirvana. Everyone needs this CD! There is NO bad song on it!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />1. Smells Like Teen Spirit - 10/10 - Nirvana's most famous song, and a very good song with an ausome intro.<br />2. In Bloom - 7.5/10 - A good song, but it gets a little old after a while.<br />3. Come As You Are - 8.5/10 - Also a good song, but not the best. Very good song to calm you down.<br />4. Breed - 11/10 - Very possibly my favorite Nirvana song. This is the traditional Nirvana with a quicker beat and a really great chorus. Plus an ausome guitar solo in the middle.<br />5. Lithium - 9/10 - A great song with a really cool chorus. Talks about a guy who is completly strung out on lithium.<br />6. Polly - 8/10 - A much slower song, also a great song to calm yourself down. A bit depressing, talks about his girlfriend, but it isn't a breakup song.<br />7. Territorial Pissings - 10/10 - Great song! Really cool chorus. This also has a quicker beat and a lot of Kurt screaming.<br />8. Drain You - 8.5/10 - A pretty good song, with a nice chorus. Like I said, not a bad song on the CD. <br />9. Lounge Act - 10/10 - Another really good song. For once the chorus is only ok, its the rest of the song that is really ausome.<br />10. Stay Away - 8/10 - A good song, kind of repetitive, but not the best.<br />11. On A Plain - 8.5/10 - Again a bit deppressing, it's still a really good song.<br />12. Something In The Way - 7/10 - Very slow, very depressing if you listen to the words. My least favorite song on the CD, but still not a bad song.<br />So if you are a long time or aspiring Nirvana fan, you need this CD. I would recomend it even if you are hesitant, buy it used, if you like it, as I do not doubt, you can expand your collection, if you don't like it, then you didn't waste too much.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I ended up shelling out major dough for the gift set and it was worth it.  I agree with the other reviewers about the flip disc nonsense, but ultimately the merits of the film outweigh the inconveniences of flipping the disc.  Only two or 3 films out of the several hundred that I've seen have made me shed a tear and this was one of them.  Everyone should own this movie. It's a lesson of how not only one man can save many but how even in the face of evil, hope survives.

The best part is when the guy falls off the side and hit his head on the propeller! it was hilerious!  How did these awful piece of crap win 11??? Saving Private Ryan deserved 11.  The Shawshank Redemption deserved 11, but did they win them? NOOOOO!! Shawshank didn't even win 1!!!! and private ryan didn't even win best picture, when it is possibly THE most realistic movie, if not time period movie ever made! Titanic sucks, unless yer looking for people having sex on the Titanic.
0385720920|3.0|This is the first book that I have read by <BR>Chuck Palahniuk, and while I was not particularly fond of the book I did enjoy his writing style.  Its fast-paced and crazy to go along with the insane story line.  I think that Palahniuk used some great lines in the book and I actually like that he would use them repeatedly.  I though the premis of &quot;choke&quot; in which the main character pretedss to choke to death and make someone a hero was very unbeliveable, as well as many other parts of the story line. So all in all a mized review good writing, strange but not in the a terribly interesting way.  I will check out fight club soon.
B00005JKCH|1.0|It was, I suppose, inevitable, that 'Spider-Man', one of Marvel Comics' best-established and longest-running comic books, would eventually be given a Magic Of The Movies Makeover.<br />Like the X-Men, Batman and Superman before it, 'Spider-Man' is a loud, adrenilane-fuelled romp through over sixty years of characterisation and carefully developed characters. Put simply, it is a cut-down version of a Pop-Culture Legend, dumbed severely down for the benefit of the moviegoing masses.<br />Taking the lead as peter Parker is Toby Maguire, an actor, whose career, if this original is anything to judge the impending two sequels by, has taken a severe turn in the direction of 'Typecast'. As Peter Parker he is suitably weedy and nervy, but as Spiderman lacks any of the believability or sense of Cool that has made the character a comic Titan. He is grating, immature and whiney. The truly abysmal quality of the 'special' effects does not help this. Spider-Man in action is mostly a computer animation, and is noticably poorly-realised. Put simply, the character does not come across in the least way believable.<br />Runnung a close second to Maguire in terms of pointlessness is Willem DaFoe in the role of the Green Goblin. Both as Norman Osborne and the Goblin himself, DaFoe's total lack of sympathy and understanding for his role leaves us with a villain as unconvincing as his costume - which, in this day and age of astounding creative design, is unacceptably boring.<br />Kirsten Dunst is relatively good as the winsome Mary Jane Watson, ditto Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. <br />Direction is run-of-the-mill fare for this sort of blockbuster, but thanks to truly lousy special effects and a huge sense of the pedestrian impregnating the whole picture, the visual impact made by 'Spider-Man' is not enormous. A real missed opportunity for director Sam Raimi.<br />Boring script (nothing unexpected, very little character development), boring visuals and uninspired performances team with lousy characterisation to make 'Spider-Man' a huge waste of glorious potential and excellent source material, and a total exercise in mundanity.<br />Avoid!

0385510438|2.0|The Last Juror is not John Grisham's finest work. Missing are the compelling contemporary issues, high throttled suspense, and all around passions that pervade early novels such as A Time to Kill, The Chamber, The Firm, or even The Runaway Jury. The Last Juror is at least 100 pages too long for its plotline, and its ending is evident long before the final pages.<br />The book starts fast: the story of a grisly rape and murder, and subsequent trial make for some page-turning. A jury is presented with the classic question: life in prison or the death sentence? Hardly suspenseful, for the deliberations (not at all sketched by Grisham) come only halfway through the novel, and the book jacket has all but given the ensuing plot away anyway. So the reader trudges through the next decade of the novel's storyline, year by boring year. Ostensibly, the narrator, owner of the local newspaper in the small Mississippi town (same setting as A Time to Kill) must fill us in on every detail of life that happens between this first trial and the ultimate (hey, no surprise here at all...) parole of the threatening killer. Every column, obituary, advertisement ever published by narrator's paper, The Ford County Times, is chronicled. Grisham drags us through the young man's haberdashery conversion, his social life (quite dull), his religious research (gee, there are a lot of enthusiastic Christian churches in the Bible Belt, no kidding?), and his eating and sleeping habits. By the time the protagonist has built up his business, we feel we, too, have earned shares in the venture.<br />We don't really delve back into any real action until the final sixty pages of the book. OK, again no surprises (it's on the book jacket): someone is killing the jurors who originally convicted our parolee. Even then, there is little suspense. We have the list of jurors, we are waiting for the killings and final resolution.<br />Grisham could have done much better with the topic of parole injustice, and he certainly missed the boat on this one. This book should have been released during the Willie Horton days of Dukakis v. Bush. It might have held more interest.certainly missed the boat on this one.

B00005JL7Q|4.0|Why people keep banging on about Hugh Grant's performance in 'About A Boy' is beyond me. Now, it's not that he's not excellent, because he is, but there are so many other excellent, multi-faceted performances in here, and they really are deserving of as much attention as Grant.<br />The plot follows that of Grant as Will, a single man whose ineptitude at relationships has left him very alone at the age of 38. Upon realising that single mothers are an untapped source of women and one-night stands, he invents himself a child and joins the group SPAT (Single Parents Alone Together). Here he meets Susie, who introduces him to Marcus (Nicholas Hoult) and his hippie, depressive mother Fiona (Toni Collette). From here, Will and Marcus form an unlikely attachment as the man teaches the boy about trendy living, and the boy teaches the man about human relationships.<br />Although the screenplay does interfere quite a bit with the story laid down in Nick Hornby's excellent original novel (of the same name, and well worth a read), this becomes immaterial in the face of powerhouse performances from the three leads. Grant as Will is very convincing as the emotionally-frozen man who starts to thaw slowly. He's wry and detached, and his trademark Brit-Flop method of acting is wisely reigned in here. He's very, very good as Will. Nicholas Hoult as Marcus is truly excellent, a highly gifted child actor playing a part which is essentially adult in attitude and depth, and he does a supreme job with the character of the slightly indie, left-field Marcus. And Toni Collette is simply stunning as the hapless Fiona, a hippie-mom whose passion for individuality leads to her son's ostracisation and her own depression. She is tender, believable and heartwarming, and generates huge amounts of sympathy for her character.<br />Direction is really very, very good, with some interesting arial shots and gorgeous camerawork used by the brothers Weitz to illustrate various states of emotional turmoilexperienced by the three protagonists. This creativity and professionalism, as well as the general all-round feeling of warm detatchment created by the film, is a far greater testament to the Weitz Boys' talent than any of the abysmal 'American Pie' trilogy.<br />All in all, this is a really wonderful movie. Warming, thought-provoking and refreshingly different, it's a triumph of acting and a hugely welcome change from the Hollywood Brigade.<br />Highly recommended.
B000003S16|5.0|I originally had this album on vinyl and it sounds even better on CD.  This album is still sounds fresh after all these years.  If you are a fan of the likes of Peter Gabriel, Brian Eno, or even the modern electronic stuff, get this CD.
B000066HI4|5.0|I am trying to be frugal with my five star reviews but this album deserves full marks without question.  Judging by my screen name, one can safely assume that I am a Will Oldham fan. I, myself not being much of a writer, will avoid trying to pin this album down with my words but direct those interested to reviews at both pitchforkmedia.com and nme.com.

B00008DDXC|1.0|I'm sure anyone who is interested in owning the 2end installment of the Harry Potter series movies has already seen it in the theatre, or seen the first one.  That would seem enough to understand the terrible, sour ambiance of these films.  Firs tof all, the acting is terrible.  Almost all the character show no desicion-making and they are nor believable whatsoever.  Emma Watson and Daniel Radclife were particularly frustrating in their acting.  The screenplay is awful anyway, so I don't entirely blame the actors.  The cinematography is bad, the special effects are sloppy.  Please, do yourself a fovour and don't watch the movies.<BR>I suggest Lord of the Rings, all three in the trilogy, The Secret of Roan Inish, Hidalgo, Fairytale: a True Story, Chcocolat, Benny and Joon, City of Lost Children

Anyone who has seen the peppers knows their live performances are what REALLY set them apart from everyone else -- this dvd is a perfect example why. Do yourself a favor and buy this right now.

B000069HZP|5.0|Nicholas Van Orton ( Michael Douglas) is an extremely wealthy San Francisco banker who owns everything he could possibly want. Unfortunately, he is also extremely lonely, because he has no one to share it with. Nicholas is turning 48, and his strange and eccentric brother Conrad ( Sean Penn)wants to give Nicholas the perfect gift for his birthday. Conrad gives him an invitation to a company called Consumer Recreation Services, that specializes in creating games that are designed specifically for the participant. Unable to resist, Nicholas decides to go through with it. However, soon after Nicholas signs up, very strange and horrible things start to happen to him, which leads Nicholas to believe that the game he is involved in, will have him playing for his life.<br />&quot;The Game&quot; is without a doubt one of the most thrilling and suspenseful films I have ever seen. I was literally drawn into the film from beginning to end. Nothing is what it seems in this film. The end is perhaps the film's best feature because it is completely unpredictable. There are so many twists and turns, that the movie may appear confusing at times. But if you are willing to give the concentration and patience that is needed, watching The Game can be a very rewarding experience. Michael Douglas is an amazing actor, and it shows in this film. You legitimately come to feel for his character, because of how well he portrays the character breaking down. Watching Michael Douglas's character lose control of his life is frightening and somewhat amusing as well. Sean Penn, Deborah Unger, and the rest of the cast all do a great job as well.<br />Overall, &quot;The Game&quot; is probably one of the best psychological thrillers ever made. The film is unpredictable and suspenseful from beginning to end, and the performances given from Michael Douglas and company could not have been better. My only advice with this film is that you be willing to pay attention and concentrate on what is going on. This is a film that you need to use your mind when watching.
B00018D3RI|5.0|What a great flashback to the 70's! This was lots of fun to watch all the episodes again!
B00003CX95|5.0|For those who don't know the story behind the film, it is a simple but affective one. Mel Gibsion plays a Scottish commoner named William Wallace, who leads an uprising against the cruel and tyranic king of England named Edward Longshanks (Patrick McGoohan)to free Scottland from English rule. <br />Very few films come close to Braveheart. It is perhaps one of the most inspiring and powerful films ever made. Mel Gibson could not have done a better job. He not only took on the difficult task of directing this film, but he also played the lead character. The passion and energy that he brought into the character of William Wallace is incredible, and watching him act out the role will amaze you. The rest of the cast was filled with talented actors who nailed their roles as well such as Angus MacFadyen ( Robert the Bruce), Patrick McGoohan ( Edward Longshanks), and Sophie Marceau ( Princess Isabelle). However, the performances given from the entire cast, is not the film's only strong point. The battle scenes are incredible. The sheer violence and authenticity of each battle scene is unreal. It is so realistic looking, that you will be made to flinch at times. The film also features a powerful soundtrack filled with beautiful bagpipe scores that really add to each scene. Last but not least is the film's ending. It is perhaps one of the best I have ever seen, and it brought the film to a thrilling and satisfying conclusion.<br />Overall, Braveheart will go down as one of the best films ever made in my opinion. There are very few films that match its intensity, authenticity, and inspiring story. Mel Gibsion should be proud because he created a masterpiece. The DVD is definately the way to go in this case. First of all, the whole film is captured on one disk, and you do not have to worry about switching tapes. Secondly, you get a behind the scenes featurette on the making of the film and commentary from Mel Gibsion. The picture and sound quality is excellent as well.<br />A solid 5 stars...
0393057658|5.0|Who knows baseball better - the jocks or geeks? Well, it appears that you can't rid the front office of jocks, but you're screwed if you don't let the geeks in.  Lewis has written a book that ultimately proves that careful statistical analysis is often superior to conventional wisdom in finding out what makes good baseball players and teams.  <br />Moneyball tells the story of the A's general manager Billy Beane and his assistant Harvard grad Paul DePodesta and their quest to build an A's team armed with the smallest budget in baseball and a new approach to baseball stats.  The success that they achieve proves once again that people cannot accept the fact that science is superior to intuition and conventional wisdom in many circumstances.  Beane is a former major leaguer whose promising career never really took flight despite everyone's high expectations.  Fortunately, he found his niche in the front office of the Oakland A's, a team he transformed by deemphasizing the conventional wisdom that had falsely predicted the outcome of his own major league career.<br />Inspired by the sabermetrician Bill James whose Baseball Abstracts were appreciated by only a handful, Beane and DePodesta decided that the best way to spend the tiny A's budget was to draft or trade for players who were undervalued in the baseball market but whose stats told a different story.  For example, they realized that on base percentage was worth more than home runs or batting average.  They wanted players who could get on base whether by walk or hit.  After all, a home run is worth a lot more if previous batters make it on base.  Beane and DePodesta also realized among many other things that good fielding stats were overrated, errors were often meaningless, and luck plays a huge role in the outcome of a baseball game.<br />The beauty of this book is that it reminds us again and again that no matter how strong your subjective notions are, don't forget that statistical analysis is an objective enterprise largely devoid of emotional attachments and preconceived ideas.  Of course, choosing players based completely on refined statistical analysis while ignoring other nonquantifiable factors is foolish, but the A's are proof that this new approach is extremely effective.<br />Very highly recommended.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Maximus Decimus Meridias ( Russell Crow) is the general of the Roman army. Over the course of being general, Maximus has won many victories which has caused him to be loved by not only his soldiers, but the aging emperor Marcus Aurelius ( Richard Harris) as well. As time grows nearer towards the emperor's death, he names Maximus as his successor over his son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix)in a private conversation between Maximus and himself. When Commodus is told the news by his father, Commodus kills him in a fit of rage. In order to keep his father's last wishes hidden, he orders that Maximus and his family are to be killed so that he can become Rome's newest emperor. Maximus manages to escape before he can be killed, but loses his will to go on when he discovers his wife and son dead. He is captured by a slave trader named Proximo ( Oliver Reed) and forced to compete as a Gladiator until he is killed in battle. However, Maximus proves to be a worthy Gladiator, and soon wins the hearts of the crowds in the Colliseum. Maximus uses his desire for revenge to fuel his way towards gaining his revenge on Commodus.<br />Ridley Scott's &quot;Gladiator&quot; is an amazing film. For 2 1/2 hours I was glued to the screen and loving every minute of it. Gladiator is the first film since Braveheart, that captivated me and left me speechless. Everything about this film was extremely well done. The story was extremely inspiring because of what Maximus is forced to go through. At times I was also somewhat amused by the story because it featured elements of the WWE and reminded me of the Stone Cold Steve Austin/ Vince McMahon feud. The more that Maximus rebelled against the system and defied the emperor Commodus, the more he was revered. The battle scenes in this film are unreal. They are so violent and realistic, that you wil be made to flinch at times. The musical score to this film was amazing. It was extremely powerful and moving. Each time that it played throughout the film, the intensity of the scene would increase. I also thought that Ridley Scott did an excellent job at recreating the Colliseum and ancient Rome in general. Everything from the actor's dialogue to the costume designs were dead on. Rusell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were both amazing in their roles and played extremely well off of each other. Their feud was extremely entertaining throughout the whole film. Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, and Djimon Hounsou were all fantastic in their roles as well.<br />Overall, Gladiator is a great film. The story is inspiring, all the actors involved did a great job, the musical score was very powerful, and the film effectively recreated ancient Rome. The 2 disc DVD set is great on its own. The first disc features the film and offers outstanding picture and sound quality. If you have surround sound, you will love watching this film when using it. The second disc contains nothing but extras that include 25 minutes of deleted scenes, featurettes, an interview with Hans Zimmer on the making of the musical score, and more.<br />A solid 5 stars...
B000084T18|5.0|With Eminem by your side, and being backed by Dr Dre's beats, how could this not be the first chapter in the 50 Cent success story? 'Get Rich Or Die Trying' will be known as one of the big hitters, like a Slim Shady LP, an Illmatic or even an All Eyez On Me - a classic - with almost every track being a great listen. From the very beginning you just knew the album was headed in no other direction then platinum. The album's first single 'In Da Club' is an instant classic, produced by no other then Dre himself. '21 Questions' shows the softer side of 50's thug-like persona, completed with help from legendary vocalist Nate Dogg. The released remix of 'P.I.M.P' featuring Snoop Dogg makes a great club track to top it all off.<br />The album also showcases Eminem's talent for production ('Patiently Waiting' and 'Don't Push Me') and the now famous G-Unit members Lloyd Banks and Young Buck's mic skills, making a fulfilling touch on the album without being overexposed. Miscellaneous high points of Get Rich... include the comical yet serious Ja Rule diss track 'Back Down', the addictive 'High All The Time' and the album's great intro 'What Up Gangsta'.<br />Get Rich... has all the workings of a classic album - beats, rhymes, even some life. The future is no other then 50 Cent.
B0000A118M|5.0|Until I checked the amazon reviews page, I had never met a single person who had heard this album and didn't absolutely love it.  I'm not saying that the single star givers aren't entitled to their opinion, but my experience is that my large swathe of Jazz Fan friends would unanymously give this 5 stars.  It is not hard bop, but it is beautiful, whether you invest in the spirituality of it or not.  This is one of the great albums of all time.
B000002MG1|5.0|before automatic for the people, REM had released several amazing albums such as murmur, reckoning, document, and out of time, but after making an album this good, its hard to follow it up. people always say bad things about monster, but of course its not going to seem great. it followed this for god sakes. this album is a beautiful, but melancholy masterpiece from one of the past 2 decades best bands. it starts out with drive, a song taht for some reason reminds me of david essex old song &quot;rock on&quot; . its probably one of my favorite cuts on the album. try not to breathe has a sweeping melody, with very visual lyrics. sidewinder sleeps tonite is the most upbeat song on the album. its a great song, but it just seems out of place here. everybody hurts. i can't say anything about this song that hasn't been said. its just probably one of the best songs ever written. new orleans instrumental isn't anything special, but it sounds good. sweetness follows has one of the most depressing opening lyrics i've ever heard in a song. you'll have to get it yourself to hear it, but this is a great song. monty got a raw deal is a good track, i enjoy the guitar playing in it quite a bit. ignoreland is probably my least favorite cut on the album, but its starting to grow on me. star me kitten is sort of a lull of a song, but its pretty good. man on the moon is a classic rem song, end of story. it has a sort of upbeat sadness to it. i can never figure out if it makes me feel happy or sad, but its a great song. nightswimming is probably my second favorite cut on the album. it has a sort of nostalgic feel to it, that reminds me of summer. find the river is a great way to end the album, and end the greatest period of the bands career. after this album, they really went downhill quite a bit. if you're new to rem, get this or murmur, but you jsut have to have this.
B000059HAI|4.0|I just watched this last week (Mar 2004). It took over an hour for the movie to give you the background before you got close to the battle scene. But the final hour was great, including a scene with a woman flying instructor being dumbfounded as her paltry biplane is taken over by a hundred zeros and bombers. <br />The fx were great, even by 2004 standards. No fake CG stuff, you know all those planes on the tarmac were really blowing up. In todays movies, you just see a big fireball with some unrecognizable parts flying about. In this film, you saw propellers flying straight off the engine, unattached engines sliding into buildings, cowlings popping straight up, and fiery airplanes with no driver hitting other parked airplanes causing a chain reaction explosion. Plus they managed to capture the real sound when each part hit the pavement. I don't remember too many films that ever did that. <br />The fx left me saying &quot;Wow! I bet that was hard to set up!&quot;
0800130928|5.0|&quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, directed by Martin Scorcese, is a great psychotic and dark film about a man, Travis, who suffers from insomnia and begins his job as a taxi driver.  As he begins developing more psychotic thoughts, the plot becomes more interesting.  The several twists and turns keep audiences' eyes wide open for every second.  The grizzly streets of New York City offer a closer, more interesting look into every event.  Such dark theme makes this film ahead of its time; in fact, some may say it's also ahead of our time.  The multiple storylines keep the plot interesting the whole time, namely a woman, Betsy, he's obsessed with and a twelve-year-old prostitute, Iris (nickname &quot;Easy&quot;), that he wants to help.  This leads to a powerful conclusion.  The presented quality deserved its four Oscar nominations, including Best Picture of 1976.<br />The actors add their own powerful psychotic theme to &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;.  Robert De Niro plays Travis delightfully.  His every expression is flawless.  Jodie Foster plays Iris beautifully as her character's pain and yearning are expressed to the fullest.  She proves that she was one of the best child actors from the 1970's.  This role is great for audiences to watch to see how she's become the genius actress she is.  All other actors also performed their roles wonderfull, namely Cybill Shephard, Harvey Keitel, and Peter Boyle.<br />&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; is a great film for audiences looking for a unique drama.  Its dark theme will never be forgotten by any viewer.  This will surely continue to be a classic for many more years.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show flew right under my Radar and I had never heard of it until a few weeks ago.  I read an article about shows cancelled too early and this was #5 so i was interested.. especially since I had missed it completely!  I thought, how could you do a Space/Western.?  A few days later a  few friends are talking about the dvd's and one said he would loan them to me.  I thought sure, why not.. not really knowing if I had time to watch them. I watched the 2 hour opener and was hooked.  I was laughing at times and totally immersed.  The show was great.  It had action, humor, good acting.. and the special effects were movie quality.  I am on episode 8 and need to return the borrowed DVD's and I am frantic.  Also, I feel the end coming and it is not a good feeling.  Knowing there is a movie in the works is nice, but there is something about an hour show a week that really lifts the spirits.  I recommend them with a non fanatical viewpoint.  They leave you with a good feeling.
1591391105|4.0|There are many original great ideas presented in this book which stand alone on their own merit.  But perhaps the biggest idea of the book is for companies to view a job transition as any other business process- and subsequently look to optimize it.  There are so many transitions in most companies in any given year, that having a process that makes more transitions successful and the new employees effective sooner should noticeably improve the bottom line.  Most importantly, this book makes you think!<br />Also noteworthy in this book is its straightforward organization- the book lays out 10 areas to consider during a transition, then dedicates a chapter to each, and concludes with a brief summary.  The book also reads well, and has examples to clarify the 10 areas.

B0000WN0ZK|1.0|I was in my early teens when this movie first came out, and it really knocked me out.  It still does. It is full of mystery and art, beauty and pathos, banality and the sublime. I didn't fully understand it either then or now, and maybe Antonioni didn't altogether either, but he certainly knew he was on to something.  It is beautiful and mesmerizing in any case, and one of a handful of films I really enjoy seeing over and over...decade after decade.<br />That said, I was driven nearly apoplectic by the driveling idiocy of the commentary track on this new DVD.  This blithering hyena would have ruined the film for me forever had I not had the presence of mind to shut him off after the first 25 minutes or so.  From informing us all that there is \\"no such thing as nature\\" (it's just a \\"social construct\\"...right, like an \\"avalanche\\") to hammering home ad nauseam that men are evil oppressors and women are their innocent victims (it couldn't be that both sexes are prone to selling themselves out...as the film so clearly depicts), this imbecilic clown bludgeons any viewer with a remnant of a functioning brain with what a total boondoggle collegiate \\"Film Studies\\" are.  <br />Do the whole world a favor, and buy this great movie on VHS, which has excellent quality.  Don't reward the mindless drudges of P.C. academia by buying this disc.
6305308659|5.0|A beautiful film, make no mistake. But what is \\"Pleasantville\\" really about? The \\"moral/repressed\\" 1950's against the \\"decadent/free-spirited\\" 1990's? I would venture not -- rather, the town of Pleasantville represents a fantasy of what the 1950's were like, a peek at what many imagine was a golden age of \\"family values\\" and sexual innocence. The fact that the 1950's were not actually like this is passed over by many of the film's critics, who see the sexual elements in the film as an attack on morality typical of an equally imaginary \\"immoral\\" modern world.<br />But \\"Pleasantville\\" is about fantasy and reality, not the 1950's and the 1990's. The characters take on color not because they are discovering sexuality but because they are becoming whole human beings rather than imaginary characters in an unchanging idyllic world. This is no less true of David/Bud and Jennifer/Mary Sue than it is of the citizens of the town. The symbolism of the fruit, paralleling the Biblical story of emerging human awareness and its divinity, is powerful. Contrary to those who see the knowledge of good and evil as an affront to God, \\"Pleasantville\\" reminds us that it is this knowledge that makes us like God, possessing of a divine nature that other animals lack. As to the charges that the film glorifies irresponsible sexuality, I point out that Jennifer/Mary Sue only achieves color when she stops having sex and discovers that there is more to life than the shallow pleasure-only morality she had previously embraced. One must be sexual to be whole, but one cannot be whole if one is only sexual.<br />So see \\"Pleasantville\\", but be warned: it will challenge you in ways that few stories do.
B00018D3RI|5.0|The friendship, baby.  That's what I'm talking about.  Sure, nowadays the plot lines are drab and predictable, but the way the boys handled it was pure class.  I enjoyed &quot;Snow Storm&quot;, &quot;The Fix&quot; (for obvious hurt/comfort scenes between the guys) and &quot;Coffin For Starsky&quot; (ibid).  It was a series that was comical in many aspects (as season 4 portrayed), so the movie is, in all fairness, simply a take off from that perspective.  I enjoyed the movie and have seen it twice.  I believe they rewrote the characters to give them more appeal to today's audience (and as the audience has laughed throughout the movie both times I've seen it, it seems to be working), but the basic premise of the friendship is the same.  There's even a real touching moment when Hutch goes off and gets drunk after he and Starsky have a falling out.  I found myself going, &quot;Awww&quot; both times.  The series on DVD is what I've been waiting over 20 years for.  Uncensored, non-homophobic full length episodes.  Uncut.  Beautiful.  Let the guys and buddies touch, dog-gone it, it's not like they're gonna get married!  Then again...&lt;G&gt;  Sorry, had to say it. And when the movie comes out on DVD, I'll be the first to pre-order it.  For me, as a fan of the series, it's a must have in my collection.  Here's hoping the other 3 seasons of S and H come out on DVD soon.  I've already finished this one and am raring to go on the others.  Thanks ever so much!!
0060558121|5.0|In a world of constantly evolving beliefs and morals, this book stands to try to explain why we as Americans feel pressure to change our spiritual selves. Using Shadow to stand for our evolving society Gaiman shows how we WILL make it out the other side and how the new and old can coexist.<br /><br />With that said, the best parts of this book are the small bits of historical fiction interlaced with the main story that explain how some of the gods came to America in the first place. It has piqued my interest in old religions and an interest that goes beyond a book is the highest acolyte I can give.

The most interesting aspect of her music for me are the country songs where I am not normally a fan of country music but I find her brand of it so alluring that I could be, if everybody's sounded as good as hers.<br />The most popular song on this CD which is arguably her best to date is &quot;Soak Up the Sun,&quot; but if one were to listen to the entire album they would find a plethora of tracks that could all have easily made it far in the charts had they been given the opportunity.<br />Overall, I highly recommend this album or any other album written and performed by Sheryl Crow as she can most certainly be counted among the top female artists in the industry today which can be directly attributed to the overwhelming appeal of her music in both the pop and country arenas.  {ssintrepid}
B000066NW0|5.0|That's what this CD leaves you wanting - more.  Avril is a very talented teenager and this CD is proof.  Well written honest songs and captivating music abound.  Definately worth buying.
0345440900|1.0|Parenting is such a personal thing and everyone has their own style.  For me, honestly, I feel this book lays a poor foundation between the parent and the child.  Sure she has some ways of getting your child to behave the way you want them to; but that was exactly my problem with the book.  I was uncomfortable with many of the tenents espoused here.  Of course there was a lot of sound advice, but overall the main principles of this guide conflict with what I see as positive, thoughtful, child oriented parenting.  My criteria for anything I read:  I ask myself if I was the child would I want my parents reading this book.  My answer on this one is a NO.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|John Debney's score to &quot;The Passion Of The Christ&quot; is a wonderful tribute to the sacrifices made by our Lord!  This soundtrack just moved my heart tremendously and listening to it made me weep.  My favorite tracks are &quot;Mary Goes To Jesus,&quot; &quot;Crucifixion,&quot; &quot;Raising The Cross,&quot; &quot;Jesus Is Carried Down,&quot; and &quot;Resurrection.&quot;  The packaging is beautiful.  I just wish that the CD was a little longer.  Perhaps in the near future, Integrity will put out an expanded edition of &quot;The Passion.&quot;  This CD should be played every Sundays during church service!
0141301066|5.0|Matilda<BR>By: Roald Dahl<BR>Reviewd By : J. Lee<BR>Period: P.1<br />    This story was about an intelligent girl named Matilda.  She wasn't loved or noticed by her family.  Her father was a crook, all her mother loved to do was play bingo, and her brother got all the attention.  Matilda is like a genius, but only young of age.  Her parents just thought that she was a little girl that should not be heard or seen.  They used her as an excuse of everything wrong that went on in their lives.  But that became worse when she was sent to Crunchem Hall Primary.  Her teacher, Miss Honey, was a sweet person that loved little children, but the headmistress of the school, the \\"Trunchbull\\", was the problem.  Aside from Matilda's parents, Miss Trunchbull was the other person that blamed Matilda for everything that went wrong in her life.  Miss Trunbull wasn't only the headmistress of the school, but was also an ex-Olympic hammer thrower.  The only person who actually cared of and noticed Matilda's intelligence was her teacher, Miss Honey.  At first, Miss Honey was puzzled by how much Matilda knew, but later, she brought text books from the older classes for Matilda since Miss Trunchbull wouldn't let her move up.  Matilda became closer to Miss Honey and she became to know more of her.  One day in class, Matilda found something amazing about herself.  She was able to move objects with her eyes.  She was at first surprised, but later, got used to it, and soon, she had a great idea.  The day Miss Trunchbull came to teach the class, Matilda played a little prank on Miss Trunchbull, and that caused Miss Trunchbull to return everything in her posession to Miss Honey, who was the true owner.  Matilda's family had to move to Spain, and because she didn't want to be with them and they didn't want to keep her, Miss Honey became her new guardian, and they lived happily after.<BR>   I liked this book because it had unnatural things, such as having the power to move objects.  I liked the ideathat Matilda became interested in books and taught herslef to read around 2 or 3.  It was interesting how she was such an intelligent child with not so intelligent parents.  Even though she had parents that didn't love her and didn't give attention to her, she had an intelligent mind and a sweet heart.  I think that's what made me love this book most of all.  <BR>   \\"'Your daughter is a cheat and a liar,' the father said, taking his plate of fish and placing it on his knees.\\"  I was surprised by the way Matilda's father spoke about his own daughter.  He was cold-hearted and said it as if her didn't know her.  What amazed me most was that even with parents that just watched TV all day, she was a genius.  <BR>  \\"The Trunchbull, this mighty female giant, stood there in her green breeches, quivering like a blancmange.\\"  I believe that this chapter had the most humor, because there was much about Miss Trunchbull's fears, and how she reacted towards it.  It was funny how she thought a small, harmless newt was a snake or a crocodlie.  With her strength, I was surprised that she wouldnt be able to take a snake, or even a newt.<BR>   My favorite part of the book was when Matilda lifted the chalk with her eyes and started to write on the wall.  She wrote to Miss Trunchbull pretending to be a ghost.  Miss Trunchbull, standing in the classroom, watching a floating chalk writing about what she had done wrong years ago made her turn white.  Soon enough, Miss Trunchbull was on the floor and unconcious.  The next day, everything was returned to the rightful owner and she was nowhere to be seen.  It was my favorite part, because Miss Trunchbull got what she deserved after all these years of torturing children and others, especially Miss Honey.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This girl has serious talent.  Her range is beyond amazing and some of the beats just make you want to listen to this CD over and over again.  The lyrical content is fabulous - I don't think it could get much better than this.  BTW, people need to stop dissin her fashion sense.  Most people don't look as good as she does so they probably get all jealous when they see her in skimpy clothes.  Avril probably wishes she looked like X-tina.  Hell, Avril probably wishes she could SING like X-tina too, but we all know that's not gonna ever happen.   The best songs on this album, I think, are: Can't Hold Us Down, Beautiful, I'm OK, Dirrty, The Voice Within, and Singing my Song.  All of the songs are fabulous, though, and you won't want to skip over a single one of 'em.  Besides, these songs have positive MESSAGES!  What more could you ask for?
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin DVD (2 disc set)<br />&quot;YOU NEED IT!!&quot;<br />Another MUST for every Zepfan and everybody that really loves music, good music, should get this Led Zeppelin DVD(2) box set!<br />Excellent DVD depicting Led Zeppelin Live from their early raw powerful sound to their comeback concert in Knebworth 1979...truly magnificent sound and visuals.<br />You get footage from early Zeppelin in 1970 at the Royal Albert Hall.  You could see this band was destined to become legends in their own time.  Very hypnotic!!<br />Songs like &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot;<br />&quot;What Is and What Should Never Be&quot;, &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, &quot;How Many More Times&quot;, &quot;I Can't Quit You Baby.&quot;<br />You even get some footage from Madison Square Garden 1973 from the same period of The Song Remains The Same. The band already had their image and sound down. Songs done from this period &quot;The Ocean&quot; &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; &quot;Black Dog&quot; &quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot;<br />Also you get to see and hear them when they ruled as ROCK GODS in 1975 Earls Court. In a word HOT!!! Check out... &quot;Stairway To Heaven&quot; &quot;In My Time Of Dying&quot; &quot;Going To California&quot;<br />Lastly the Knebworth concert in 1979...the sound is supreme.  You get to hear songs like &quot;Achilles Last Stand&quot;, &quot;In The Evening&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Fault But Mine&quot;.

Definitely worth every penny!<br />Keep a coolin'<br />Vilma<br />Mystic Rock Boutique<br />[...]
B000084T18|4.0|I thought this was 50's first CD but apparently was wrong.  There's also Power of the Dollar and another one, I think.  Anyway, this one's pretty good and I'm glad Em and Dre found this guy.  Though it was kinda rude of him to just walk across the stage when Evanescence won 'his' Grammy and then later say, \\"I'm never going to the Grammy's again - I shoulda won that Best New Artist Award.  I don't know how Evanescence won.\\"  Well, I have heard better, like his mentors Eminem and Dre, for instance.  Still, this guy remains one of my faves.  He puts his heart where the mic is and talks of his life experiences.  Of course you'll hear a ton of gun references, references of how he was shot, a little bit of sex here and there.  My fave songs are: What up Gangsta, Patiently Waiting, Many Men, If I Can't, 21 Questions, and especially, Don't Push Me.
B000056NX5|3.0|I can't help but compare this to the 1973 version, as well as the tour I saw in the mid 90's.<br />As far as the acting &amp; direction goes, I really think this version at least matches(if not surpasses) the others that I've seen.  In particular is the dynamic between Judas &amp; Jesus.  I also appreciated the whole design, even if a few of the costumes were a bit over the top for me. (Pilate = M. Bison?)<br />I felt that his version made Judas seem a bit more mean spirited, &amp; seemed to suggest a different outcome for him as well.  In the 1973 version &amp; the tour I saw Judas performed &quot;Superstar&quot; in flashy, white outfits while this version has him in a devilishly red one.<br />This Jesus also seems to be in less control of things around him, though that's just this version's interpretation.<br />As far as the vocal talent goes, the following stood out as good or bad:<br />* Judas did not have the same range that Carl Anderson had in the 1973 film &amp; in the 90's tour when I saw him.  Not bad, but certainly not the best renditions I've heard.<br />* Jesus also lacked the range of Ted Neeley in both the 1973 &amp; 90's tour.  While I've heard people complain about Neeley's high notes, I'd say this this Jesus often felt quite flat to me.<br />* Mary was great, though I've not heard a bad rendition of her parts.<br />* Caiphas(sp?) had some great, low tones but I was unimpressed with him attempts at anything else.<br />* Pilate was much different from any other performance I've heard, but I liked it quite a bit.<br />Finally, my favorite part of this DVD was actually the &quot;making of&quot; feature because it actually has Weber &amp; Rice talking about JCS!
B00004T9UF|1.0|Eminem's enormous popularity is completely confusing to me. Not only is his music harsh and violent, but he himself is a really evil and heartless person. He sings songs about killing, and that's got to tell you something about him as an artist. It's a baffling wonder that he isn't sitting locked up in a jail cell at this very moment, because he has done everything a person can do to deserve it. I'm doing all I can to convince the people I know who like him that he's a disgusting excuse for a person and that they really should stop listening to him, and I hope others who share my opinion will do the same. I'm beaming with pride to call myself an Eminem hater, and I feel so strongly about it that if I knew of some anti-Eminem club I'd join in a snap. This, along with any other Eminem CD, is most certainly NOT recommended to anybody. He does not deserve the money he gets when you buy his albums. Anyone with good common sense can see that. So PLEASE stop giving him the money, there is nothing riteous he could possibly be spending it on. He is a real moron, and I hope he gets thrown in prison someday soon. Then he can stop cursing the planet with his music. Doesn't even deserve the one star.
B0000TAZBK|5.0|I thought this was a fantastic deal.  Once again, thanks to Amazon we have a really good deal.  I bought this because I'm a big LOTR fan and also because I wanted another excuse to get excited. The &quot;trading cards&quot; that come with these are okay. They are REALLY glossy, though.  I also thought they should come in a separate case, because after they are opened they are all loose and are a bit of a mess to put back into the cd case.  And if you don't put them back in, there's empty space and the 3 cds rattle around.  But otherwise, really nice pictures.<br />The soundtracks are great.  While listening to The Fellowship, I could just picture scenes from the movie. And of course, being the first movie, it has the standard music that we come to associate with Lord of the Rings.  I really liked the cd booklet, too, and not just because of the pretty designs.  It provides the words that are sung in some of the songs in Elvish (which is usually how it's sung) and the translation in English.  It also provides the words to Enya's May It Be.  <br />The Two Towers is also a superb cd.  Emiliana Torrini's version of Gollum's Song is haunting but very catchy.  I found myself stuck with that in my head for the rest of the day after I listened to it.  I was a bit disappointed with the cd booklet. It still had the Elvish words and translations, but it didn't seem like it had them all.  Also, it didn't say which lyrics belonged to which track (since the title of the lyrics is different from the track title it was a little confusing).  But the music is great.  I wasn't as familiar with Two Towers melodies, but I'm getting there.<br />And finally: The Return of the King.  Absolutely wonderful.  This cd has more vocal music than the Two Towers.  But like Two Towers' booklet ROTK's booklet didn't specify the track of the lyrics. Also, it did not provide the lyrics to The Stewart of Gondor (sung by Billy Boyd who plays Pippin and was featured in the movie).  So I just listened tothe part where he sings until I knew the words and wrote them down.  (I apologize if I got any words wrong)<br />Home is behind<BR>The world ahead<BR>There are many paths to tread<BR>Through shadow<BR>Till the edge of night<BR>Until the stars are all alight<BR>Mist and shadow<BR>Cloud and shade<BR>All shall fade<BR>All shall fade<br />There it is for whomever wants it.  I also wanted to remark on &quot;Into the West&quot;.  It is one of the most moving songs I've ever heard, and if you know the story well and read the lyrics it is the most fitting out of any of the songs written for the movie.  Especially the line &quot;The ships have come to carry you home&quot; and &quot;a light on the water/grey ships pass/into the west&quot;.  I'm not a really big fan of Annie Lennox and her voice, but the song is still good.<br />Now as I've written this review I mostly pointed out things I didn't like (with a few good, but not specific points), and yet I gave this product 5 stars.  Well just think for yourself, if the only bad parts are a few instances in the cd booklet, the rest of the product must rock.  And it does.  If you are a movie fan, buy it. It's worth it.  Plus, listened to ROTK's soundtrack can help you wait for the movie on dvd on May 25!!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|CHER is, without a doubt, the most enduring, alluring, dazzling, sensationally stunning and incredible female entertainer of all time! Cher eclipses even Cleopatra and Nefertiti of their astounding imprints on history - you are totally captivated! EVERY major hit single, including 4  #1's in her native USA, are all songs nobody but CHER could have ever turned into the monumental hits she has produced...and rarily has anyone ever dared to \\"remake\\" a CHER song she so brilliantly defined in her own unique style. Not even Madonna could ever match the POWER and ENDURANCE of CHER's FIVE DECADE outstanding long career! Madonna may have more #1 singles, but, she has none of the artistic depth nor the stylistic vocal ability and no Academy Award to her credit. CHER is the quintessential female entertainer of all time in moderm pop music. FAREWELL TOUR dvd is total proof that people will continue to demand to see MORE of CHER in years to come, and a priceless concert show which belongs in every dvd-cd collection. She is not through yet!
0316776963|5.0|By far the funniest book I've ever come across, although Naked is pretty hysterical also.  No, &quot;Me Talk&quot; is not some great piece of literature, but it's worth every cent and then some.  The comic scenes and Sedaris's telling of them is masterful and genius.  Without a doubt this is one book everyone should read.
6303492509|1.0|Tank Girl... see it.  You wanna know why?  Because this movie is so bad you'll laugh your ass off!  It's about goat/kangaroo/retards trying to save something.  A scene that will forever live in my mind is when they're done eating dinner they just start dancing in a circle for no damn reason.  But watch this movie because after it you'll want to kill the director and pull you're eyes out.
B0000787FH|5.0|The other reviewers are spot on: this is a brilliant album.  If you want to troll through Elvis' copious catalogue, do yersself a favor and add this one first. Elvis' best song, in my mind, is \\"Man Out of Time\\"; this is the album it came from.  Connect the dots.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I know I gave this a 5 star without even finishing every song. I apologize for that. However, I usually have to listen to a CD a few times before I like it. I can honestly scan this entire CD and listen to any song. The ones that get radio play are awesome of course. Christina has a lot going on this ablum. She's dipping into her culture, R&amp;B, and pop of course. In my opinion she convincingly proves she can't be cornered into any one genre. This girl could sing rock music and still be a star. Actually her and Aerosmith doesn't sound bad. Anyway, Her voice is as powerful as Whitney Houston's used to be. If you enjoy good singing then you can't go wrong with this. She has some pretty good writers in <BR>her stable too. Aguilera's music will live on into the quiet storm of radio. You know those jams that come on at midnight.
0609610570|5.0|The book that Messrs. Bossidy and Charan have co-authored is a unique blend of practical advice and real business experiences drawn from several industries.  It is especially powerful because it is superbly structured, easy to read, and free of jargon.  There are many important messages in the book, almost one on every page.  The key message is that corporate management has three principal goals:  picking other leaders, setting strategic direction, and conducting operations.  I believe that companies and organizations can use many of the ideas in this book to re-shape their thinking and to help change their corporate cultures and processes.  In my years in corporate management, I came to recognize that the most important leadership challenge is that of identifying, developing, and selecting the future leadership team for a company.  Picking great leaders can be a real challenge for any company and for any leader.  I encourage all leaders to read this important book and to use it as a catalyst for change.  There is much to be learned from this book and much to be reflected upon.  Simple but profound.
0452282152|2.0|Actually, we read this in our book club and nicknamed it &quot;The Practical Tramp&quot;.  Outside of a mildly interesting view of the era, the characters weren't all that likeable or relatable.
B00012QM9K|1.0|The movie is great, but the DVD is horrible.  There is absolutely NO excuse for making this disc a &quot;flipper.&quot;  I am incredibly disappointed.
B00012QM86|2.0|I appreciate the sentiment behind this film.  I understand what this story is about (the holocaust).  Its a serious subject.  I tried to watch this movie on TV a few years ago and just couldn't get into it.  I tried to get interested three different times, but it was just plain boring.<br />I also found out where the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; show got the idea to have one of Elaine's boyfriends carry on about how he could have &quot;done more!&quot;  He could have shown Mr. and Mrs. Seinfeld so much more...etc etc.  That's what Oskar Schindler says at the end of the movie.  I'm sorry, but I couldn't help but laugh.  I guess Jerry Seinfeld (who is Jewish), or his writers, felt the same way.
B0000CFW87|4.0|&quot;You Lift Me Up&quot; is a great song and I just love his voice.  Great album.
B000002H97|5.0|This is the best album Metallica made ever.WHY? Because the melody lines in the guitars are so awesome! Yea, sure I'd rather the two ballads not be on there, but at least the ballads have solos. Here it is song by song:<BR>Enter Sandman: Only one word can describe this song - KICKASS. The melody is cool, and the solos rock. 10/10<br />Sad But True:In my opinion, this is the best song ever made. 'Nuff said. 10/10<br />Holier Than Thou: Great rockin melody line. But, unlike some people say, it's not as heavy as Through The Never. 10/10<br />The Unforgiven: As I said, I'm not a fan of the ballads, but it's not bad.    8/10<br />Wherever I May Roam: Great song w/sweet intro. 10/10<br />Don't Tread On Me: A kickass song. It's just so awesome. The intro is cool, the solos, the lyrics, and just about everything about it. 10/10<br />Through The Never: Great heavy song, but if ur looking for heavy songs, look into Master of Puppets. 9/10<br />Nothing Else Matters: Stupid song about love. MEMO TO METALLICA: UR NOT SUPPOSED TO WRITE ABOUT LOVE. Jesus. 6/10<br />Of Wolf And Man: Good song, but not the best. 8/10<br />The God That Failed: Sweet bass intro. Great song overall. 10/10<br />My Friend Of Misery: Slow song, but at least not about love. Favorite solos are on this song.(For the Black Album). 9/10<br />The Struggle Within: Good song, but a lot like the ideas of other songs they've made. 9/10.
B000089RVX|4.0|If they would have bombed in the mainstream and Christian rock picked them up they would have been calling this a Christian Rock album, because it can easily pass for that.  (Lots of Christian rock artists write similar songs...&quot;My God my tournacit bring to me your salvation&quot;.  Anyway, this is a great rock album.  The song Immortal emphasizes her gorgeous voice, but is not well written in my opinion, too cliches (anyone that has to use the old cliche rhyme &quot;I dried your tears, calmed your fears, shows little imagination).
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's first cd is one of my favorite cds of all time, so when I heard she was releasing a second I was skeptical as to whether or not it would be able to live up to it. I was very pleasently surprised when I bought this cd though. The first time I listened to it in it's enirety I thought it was excellent, but not as good as the first. But after a second and third listen I started to appreciate its subtilties more, and now think it is just as good if not better than No Angel. I am happy to see that Dido has remained an original, individual artist despite the fact that much of the music world is regurgitating the same thing over and over again. Anybody who writes a negative review for this album is nuts, its definietly a terrific cd.
B000089RVR|5.0|Very simple, well written, well produced and well sung album.  She has a great voice and doesn't try to go where her voice won't take her.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Cannibal corpse is prolly one of the most talented &amp; original death metal band since the early 90's. Lately, there's quite a few bands that come close but none has to cannibal corpse's  sound--The only bands i seen that has the same gore content &amp; vicious lirycs that i actullie been listining to alot is my  buddys from the infamous &quot;gorerotted&quot; with their album &quot;only tools &amp; corpses&quot;--- i've bought that album &amp; it sitll hasn't left my cd player...N-e ways, back to c.c. Well, over-all? An, amazing  album with  fast,dark,haunting &amp; disturbing riffs that only cannibal corpse can do no one else!If your a fan of their early work with Chris barnes... I think you  will realy enjoy this because it seems like &quot;wretched spawn&quot; sounds even more brutal then &quot;eaten back to life&quot; and i consder eaten back to life to be deathmetal's most brutal album ever made by a band alone.Well, all i can realy tell you guys is-- if you want intense,fast,brutal,gore &amp; most of all amazing musicianship just cop your self a copy of cannibal corpse's &quot;wretched spawn&quot; and you'll be all set buddy!
B00018D44U|5.0|Norah's strength is her voice.  She knows her limits, she knows how to interpret songs, and she doesn't try to go places she can't.  It's so freshing to see a singer who can succeed on voice alone.  Kudos.
B000002GBB|5.0|My Gosh, the title track alone makes this one of the greatest albums I have ever heard. If it doesen't give you goose pimples, pinch yourself to make sure you're alive.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|Obviously not her best work.  But she still sounds great and it's a great to listen to her voice.
0345409671|5.0|Just a great book to read, a nice book to sit down and relax with because it will just bring you to the edge of your seat! Lestat brings you all over the world, to the past, Heaven, and Hell! Rice's integration of God and Vampyres is just amazing (Can't find any other better word at the moment). Definitely a book to read. As well as all her other books as well! =D
B00006CXXU|4.0|but I think sometimes she tries a bit too hard and lingers her voice all over the place.  She has a beautiful voice that is sometimes lost in the production.  &quot;Beautiful&quot; is a well written gorgeous ballad that won her a best female pop singer grammy award.  &quot;Dirty&quot; was her attempt to she her girl pop singer image and it bombed in the US and was a big hit in the UK.  I think the UK has it write, it's a great song.  I wish she'd keep more clothes on and just use her voice, but in these days of hip hop mommas, good pop singers have to sacrifice a bit of integrity to make it.  All that aside, Christina made a very good album this time.
0440219078|4.0|Jonas is a young boy that is growing up in a plain community. There is no color and people get released from the community for little reasons that we would find weird. Jonas is anticipating his twelfth ceremony; it is so exiting to him. He is given the task of being the new receiver. At first he is scared about it because he doesn't know what to expect of it. After a while he is more comfortable with his assignment. He sees what life use to be like and he wishes that it could go back to the old ways instead of having sameness. He wants to have color instead of black and white. There is a little baby by the name of Gabriel and he could not sleep on his own so he gets to stay with Jonas' family. One day while Gabriel was being noisy and upset Jonas accidentally gave him one of his memories and it seemed to sooth the little boy. After that he did it to calm him down and his parents would let Gabriel sleep in the room with Jonas because he would sleep easier. Jonas was sick of living in the community and he wanted to get away and find something else, something that existed else where, where they played music and had color. <BR>He learned what it really meant to get released from the community and he didn't like it at all. In the community they could not have identical twins. The smallest one of them would be released from the community. Since the baby's arm did not have big enough veins, a shot was put into it's forehead and it's body would go limp. This was going to happen to Gabriel because he would not sleep though the night. Jonas loved Gabriel, also known as Gabe and he didn't want that to happen to him. The Giver decided that he would help Jonas to get away from the community, but Jonas knew that he would never be able to come back again. They traveled for what seemed like forever and they were running out of food. The weather started to change and it got bitterly cold, with lots of snow falling down. They had to use the memory of warmth to survive. Helicopters were out looking for him and the baby but they soon gave up on it. Jonas and Gabe found a sled on top of a hill and they hopped onto it with all the strength that they had left. They flew down the hill and when they reached the bottom they found a house with lights all around. People were gathered around and there was music playing. Jonas thought that maybe he heard laughter and music from the community that he just left but he figured that it was probably just an echo from the house that they just had found.<BR>I really found that the book was very interesting to me. The only thing that I did not like was how the people were released from the community. Other than that it was good. There are not that many books that I can really get into. I would not want to live the way that they lived in the book, but they did not know any better. It was the way that things had been for a long time and they were use to it. It is definitely a book that I would recommend that people should read.
B00000IPAX|1.0|Even thought there's already a billion reviews written for this cd, I just had to spit out my two cents. This stuff is crap. Why, you ask? My 5 yr. old niece could play the guitar parts on this album. They have no depth in their songwriting (even for a \\"punk\\" band). The only redeeming value may be Travis's drumming, and even at that the only impressive thing is his speed. Secondly, they're NOT PUNK. Just because they drop the f bomb and talk about humping dogs doesn't mean they're punk! This music is pop, and bad pop at that. Also, the lyrics in these songs should only appeal to pubecent, pimple faced 15 yr. olds. And anyone who says Adam's Song is emotional or deep or serious is plain stupid. C'mon guys, go get some Refused if you want some real punk and stop buying this crap.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I first discovered Damien Rice by watching the video for Volcano on VH1 and from that point this CD has become my favorite. The songs in this CD range from a wonderful raw character (The Blower's daughter, with its repetition of the &quot;I can't take my eyes off you&quot; line in different degrees of pain and with a subtle cello in the back) to the unexpected epic quality of Eskimo. This is a disc that keeps company of people with a broken heart (Cheers Darling), with memories of melancholy (Older Chests), despair (Delicate, Cold Water) or love (Volcano). His voice is passionate, his songwriting poetry and his music full of contradictory yet sublime feelings. This CD is a tremendous accomplishment in a music world where many singer-songwriters sound the same and where feelings seem manufactured. This is definitely a CD for those looking for an original approach of everyday sadness.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Don't waste your time on this.
B000002I25|5.0|Their first album, fresh, original, a little psychadelic.  &quot;Crystal Ship&quot;, &quot;Take it Easy&quot;, and &quot;The End&quot; are forgotten masterpieces that reflect the originality and talent of all the band members.  Jim's lyrics were never better and this album is a must own for any musid fan!
B0000019PA|5.0|yeah, i know the album is already a few years old.  big deal, The White Album is 30+ now and people still love it.  this album is so... huge.  epic.  beautiful.  nuts.  it has a singing saw, fer crying out loud!  i bought it on a fluke when i was stranded in San Jose with no music and it's the absolute luckiest twist of musical fate i've ever had.  listen to the snippets, they only hint at what this work is.  if you like the song samples, you will ADORE the album.  you have to think big and have an open heart for this music.  i hope i have offered you any guidance, but it's hard to be objective about an album i adore this much.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There has never been a Television show that has so consumed me.  Not in a &quot;rabid fan&quot; way, but in a way I have never known.  The acting, the writing, the special effects, everything about this show is over the top amazing.  Never have I seen a show that appeals to so wide an audience, and I've yet to meet anyone who has seen it and can honestly say what they didn't like about it.  Of course, thanks to Fox's advertising, It's rare to MEET, face to face, anyone who actually SAW the show.  I've reccomended it to friends, they've bought this, and they've all become loyal fans.<br />When the movie comes out, I think Fox is going to be very, very disappointed in themselves.
B0000636UN|4.0|I am a huge fan, I own every Sheryl Crow CD. The Globe Sessions is one of the best albums ever produced, and belongs in everyone's collection. Tuesday Night Music Club was a brilliant breakout album. However, C'Mon C'Mon was a mix of stellar moments and disappointing letdowns. <br />I get the feeling this was rushed to market before completely fleshing it out. I also agree with the statement that it is too slickly produced. Knowing how capable she is of better work, I am anxiously awaiting the next CD from Ms. Crow. <br />But C'Mon C'Mon does have some great moments, and I'm glad I bought it. I was thrilled to hear the now 40 year-old Sheryl's newfound confidence in Steve McQueen (\\"I ain't takin sh*t off no one, baby that was yesterday!\\"), was awed by her depth on Safe and Sound, and even got a kick out of most of the other tunes. But the Don Henley collaboration is an amateurish yawwwwn (what was she thinking?) and many of the other tracks easily disposable. Still I love her honest lyrics and soothing harmonies. I just hope her next CD is more complete and whole-hearted, and  I won't have to skip past every-other track.
B0001I55OC|1.0|I am a very easy-going fan of both books and movies, easy to please and very diverse in my tastes, so I am almost ashamed to write this review, but here goes...<br />Avoid this movie!<br />I absolutely loved the book and expected the movie to vary, but this was a horrible adaptation of one of my favorite books.  Marek was portrayed decently, but the other characters were flat and poorly acted.  The movie was not well paced and had I not read the book I would have had no idea what was going on.  The only parts of the book taken were the concept, the beginning (very loosely) and parts of the end (again very loosely).  What they decided to do in the middle was a complete mystery.  I feel that this book could very easily become an excellent film ... someday (Keep it away from Paramount). I have come to the conclusion that Donner can't direct and couldn't have survived without an excellent actor/actress with charisma in his films (like Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapons).  This movie was one of the absolute worst films I have seen in recent years.  It beat out my old modern all-time bad film: MI-2, which at least had some action at the end to salvage an otherwise horrid film.  Unfortunately this film had no saving graces as such.  Again, I love the concept, I love the book, but keep Paramount & Donner away from good ideas, they will tear them apart to make ... yet another bad movie.<BR>P.S. - another bomb of a movie to steer clear of is, (drumroll please) yet another Paramount production, Star Trek: Nemesis.  They took something they've had for years, a great show, then good movies & made an absolute stinker of a film.<br />I think I put more effort into this rant than the filmakers did in any of the mentioned movies in this 'review'.<br />If your looking for a medieval type film, watch something like Kevin Costner & Morgan Freeman in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, or a good time travel movie, watch a Terminator flick (good for the action anyway), Frequency or the Back toThe Future Trilogy.  Don't waste time or money on this film.  Buy the book, you won't regret it.
B0001611DI|4.0|I just got this DVD in the mail today and just got done watching it, the picture and sound is great they really did do a good job but on the other side this DVD was some what a disapointment first of all its not the full Dawn of The Dead movie its the Theatrical Verson witch that suck when I was watching it and for features there's not much for features. I hope they come out with the full verson and more features.
0440234743|4.0|Troy Phelan is very rich and very old. And dying, or so it is said. His family can't wait for him to die. They're greedy and can't wait to take a share of his 11 billion dollar pie.  And the will does give them all an even share. Or so they think. Because even from the grave, Troy knows how to make them all squirm in there Armani suits. He leaves all of his money to an unknown heir and illegitimate child, Rachel Lane. And where is Rachel? Of course, she happens to be one of the hardest people on the planet to get in touch with. Nate O'Riley is sent to inform Rachel of her father's death and also that she is now the richest woman in the world. Nates journey will take him deep into the Pantanal, where the dangers he may face are dangers he hasn't even thought about yet.<br />It grabs you at the beginning, sends you at flying speeds right until the end where it gently sweeps you away. This book does not disappoint. But then again, Grisham rarely does.
0316666343|5.0|This book was AMAZING! I couldnt put it down! I'm only 13, but I know a good book when I read one! And I never read. Yesterday my teacher told me about this book, and recommended it to myself and a friend of mine. Well, lastnight my stepdad took me to get this book along with &quot;Hello From Heaven&quot; and once i purchased both books, I immediately started reading &quot;The Lovely Bones&quot;. I couldnt put it down. It's awesome!
0385504209|1.0|No less than four of my friends recommended this book to me, knowing that I am quite an enthusiast of esoteric religions and conspiracy theories.  Not being a big fan of fiction, I figured I'd give this book a shot anyway, due to the fact that it came so highly recommended.  For all the chest beating about how &quot;well researched&quot; this book is, it seems as if the &quot;historical&quot; information is quite fabricated and contrived.  The characters have a surreal, almost cartoonish quality about them, and give the reader almost no human qualities to identify with (A muscular albino religious fanatic assassin?  Give me a break!)  The &quot;suspense, murder mystery&quot; theme is so contrived and predictable I found myself almost laughing any time there was a 'chase' or 'murder' scene.  I'm certain that a fifteen year old could have written a more interesting book for a Creative Writing class, as the writing here is sub par and amateurish.  This book is yet another piece of &quot;Wonder Bread&quot; literature- i.e. a lot of people like it, but it isn't very nutritious.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|While I found this movie to be completely absorbing and well made it was ultimately very difficult to watch, and yet I was unable to tear myself away, such was my involvement.  As a matter of fact, it was so disturbing that I found myself thinking about it for days on end. A friend of mine stated it was the closest depiction of the hell of addiction that he had ever seen.  I highly recommend it if you're ready for total emotional involvement but it's not for the faint of heart and it affected me so deeply that I find that I'm unable to view it again.  This is no 'Traffic', this is the real deal.
B00004TLN3|1.0|I acknowledge that good films don't have to follow their original scripts exactly, but this one was lacking in the spirit Jane Austen wrote it in.  The characters of General Tilney and Catherine Morland are preserved, but Catherine has strange and bloody fantasies that don't match up with her character in the novel.  The saxophone that's wailing as you watch the pastoral English scenery makes you cringe, and the creepy soundtrack is better fitting for a horror movie.  Eleanor Tilney acts at once assertive and submissive, unlike her original whose timidity and obedience helped show the depth of the general's control.  And the marchioness with the Kiss makeup and the boy doing cartwheels were not created by Austen and came out of left field.  More than anything, the gory and creepy feel doesn't match up with the lighthearted satirical tone of the novel, thereby missing the point of the story.  The ending seems to fit into the type of out-there romantic and gothic writing that Austen intended to make fun of.  Let's hope a better version is made someday.
B0000C9JFO|5.0|L'Auberge Espagnole is a story of life, not of shoot them up kill the bad guy type at all.  I love this film, its about life, love and friendship, and taking off or not; doing what you really want to do, not what society dictates, love life, and absorb the experiences of every one you meet and experience into your own personality.  I've watched this film about 20 times so far and I still catch something new.<br />Romain Duris -Xavier-(Le Divorce) does a great job as the student from France finding out who he is in life.  The rest of the international exchange students (the program is called Erasmus) add so much to the film, you will find yourself wanting to see it again and again.  Life in Europe, the fun, culture and music lets you enjoy the experience as it you are there. (I even bought the sound track)<br />Cristina Brondo (the Spanish student from Tarragona) is absolutely beautiful in this as she adds the sanity to the group.<br />Audrey Tautou -Martine- plays Xavier's frustrated girlfriend in France, that seems to nag Xavier back to the past, but Xavier works that out (see the film).<br />Kevin Bishop -William- Plays the obnoxious brother of Wendy, from the UK, and his attitude really pisses off the group as he stays visiting with his sister for a bit.  His explanation of the fly's mating ritual is really funny, and by his sacrificing himself for his sister gets him the respect of the group.  So you have to appreciate everyone, since we all have qualities that make up a complete loving human race.<br />This is the best flick I've seen since Run Lola Run and Amelie, although Audrey Tautou plays a very different part in this film.<br />So what are you waiting for?  Get the Film!!
B00003CX95|5.0|I truly didn't realize how great a movie this was. I saw the end and didn't feel emotion until I watched the whole thing. The film is truly moving from start to finish. The ending is spectacular, and Mel Gibson plays an awesome character. Things happen that are really awesome. Wallace takes revenge. It isn't just a &quot;Well, let's take the prejudice and make the viewer feel terrible.&quot; William Wallace stands up to the English and decides to fight for freedom.<br />Epic from start to finish. 5 stars
B00004Y6O7|3.0|Van Halen's fourth album &quot;Fair Warning&quot; has to be the David Lee Roth era's weakest.Most reviewers have said this is a good album, but I found it to be bland and mostly unentertaining. Unchained was the only track that was memorable,Eddie's stunning axe work and Diamond Dave's personality can only carry an album so far,I love Van Halen, but I'm not going to give an uninspired album a good review just because of who the band is. With &quot;Fair Warning&quot; neither Eddie nor Dave came up with strong material to work with. I would only recommend this one for hardcore fans, and some of them may not care for it very much. New fans should try Van Halen,1984,5150,Van Halen II,and Best of Volume 1.
B000002NIW|5.0|Yeah, everyone likes this album to some extent, so there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said. It has great vocals, great guitar, well-done bass, powerful drums, a well-formed atmosphere. Take the hint, and buy this album.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|In 1978,Eddie and Diamond Dave and the rest of the gang came around when many of the great seventies hard rock bands were starting to fade away.Neverbefore had anyone made a guitar sound as great as Eddie Van Halen.Besides great guitar work,the album is filled with first rate songs to showcase Eddie's great guitar work, and David Lee Roth's over the top personality.Runnin with the Devil,Ain't Talkin Bout Love,Eruption,and You Really Got Me are just a few of the highlights on the album.Every track is a masterpiece.Van Halen's self titled album should be in any rock Cd Collection.P.S. The Warner Brothers remasters have much better sound quality than the original CD versions.

B00003CXCT|1.0|5 Stars for the 1989 VHS remastered sound original version. 0 for the upcoming DVD's. I was going to give the upcoming DVD's at least a half star, but considering the history of the \\"editions\\" in the 90's where the TV commericial for the updated efx edition(the editions >before< the Special Editions where the TV commericials said verbatim: \\"Buy the trilogy one last time!\\"), and all the travesty Lucas continues to heap on the memories of the originals etc. I'm joining the boycott. Some things on the SE changes. In ANH SE, Jabba was superimposed over a pudgy irish type Jabba(proto for Watto?). Besides the confusing Biggs scene in the later part of the movie, there was another scene near the beginning where Biggs talks to Luke about joining the rebellion presumably in Anchorage or near Luke's home. The scene is in Lucas' original movie-tie-in novelization and also in the kids' picture books. Sorry, I still don't see the \\"improvements\\" in the Death-star battle. The \\"ring\\" explosion of the Death Star is vintage ST:TNG CGI type of explosion. A soldier reports to Moff Tarkin that they count 20 or so fighters so it's not exactly a \\"bigger\\" looking battle, unless that line was cut from the movie as well.<BR>   As to why Lucas sticks by these SE versions? My theory based on reading biographical details on the making of SW(some could turn out to be just rumor so I could be wrong just like there are so many autobiographical books on Star Trek by many different cast members and assorted writers) , is that Lucas really didn't have the final say on a lot of ANH and ESB. Marcia Lucas and others had a say on how the editing and scriptwriting was done for ANH. For example, the scene where stormtrooper says \\"Looks sir, Droids!\\" and holds up that metal ring was supposedly decided to be done that way by Marcia Lucas to cut things short when Lucas wanted to do a full efx shot with dewbacks moving around instead of the still in the original. And guess what? The SE has the CGI dewbacks wandering about after all. Looks like Lucas got the final say after all after 18+ years. This and many other changes to the whole trilogy SE style could be Lucas' taking back from many others who contributed to the original and stamping his new version as totally his. Even to the point of discrediting the efx folks who did great memorable efx shots like the original explosion of the Death Star. Maybe Lucas had to compromise and now 20 years later he's doing everything he wanted, or just changing it enough to make every production decision his own. My 2nd theory is that Lucas knew LOTR was being made and he wanted to \\"upgrade\\" the efx to make the SW OT as a efx competitor for LOTR movie generation. Of course he probably didn't realize LOTR would be *that* good and now he's forced to release the DVD's just to do some \\"business\\" as his usual before it's too late and LOTR becomes the overwhelming choice of fantasy.<BR>  It should also be clarified that Lucas in the months writing the script for ANH researched Tolkien to write his \\"space fantasy\\" with Gary Kurtz. Thanks to the decades long commercialization of SW and efx movies in general, people have forgotten that SW stems and borrows very heavily from LOTR the book. Take a very close look at the sets and situations in ANH and you can just find about anything LOTR inspired. Luke's farm home looks like a hobbit mound. Many characters are similar to LOTR characters. The \\"superstructure\\" of the Death Star and Destroyers look like small cities themselves when in fact Minas Tirith was described as a city built from the stone mountain. The  Cantina scenes where more characters meet echo Bree. Darth Vader is described much like Sauron. Dark *LORD* of the sith indeed. Early scripts for ANH feature three \\"rings\\" of force power. The exhaust shaft to the \\"reactor\\" core is akin to the Cracks of MT. Doom where the ring has to be tossed. The \\"throne room\\" scene at the end is remniscent of Aragorn's crowning, otherwise why did John Williams call that track the \\"Throne Room and End Credits\\"? Interesting that some have said ROTK should have ended right after Aragorn's ceremony and ANH happens to do just that kind of an end. The Oliphaunts were described in much the same way as AT-AT walkers also serving as troop transports. And of course hobbity Ewoks which Lucas called \\"strength of heart of the 'small' folk\\" in ROTJ documentaries back in the early 80's. SW borrowed from LOTR, not the other way around due to 20 years indoctrination of Lucas efx movie driven legacy where we got jaded to all kinds of efx heavy yet script deficient movies i.e. ID4.

B000002572|5.0|Do you enjoy music that is basically upbeat and mind blowing? Look no further. Boston was, and is, one of the definitive bands of the 70's, and hold a rare world record. They hold the record for \\"The biggest selling debut album\\". Over 15 million copies of this superb album have been sold, and no wonder! This is pure rock and roll. There are no depressing, slow paced, cry your eyes songs here. The hits \\"More Than A Feeling\\", \\"Peace Of Mind\\", and Longtime, plus, the other songs are good to listen too, especially if you're feeling the blues, they can pick you up. You know those rock and roll bands who perform music and you can hardly understand a word they are saying? Well, these guys aren't like them. This is the kind of music that borders on Heavy Metal, but is more like Hard Rock. There's not a bunch of cursing as compared to other artists, and you will find yourself wanting to raise the windows in your place and let the whole neighborhood hear what you are listening too. It's that good. There is absolutely no mistaking what these boys are playing.There's tons of guitar play, some keyboard, and of course rockin bass and drums. Anyone who knows anything about music will NOT mistake it for country, or rap, or blues. This is KICK REAR ROCK AND ROLL. No matter your age, no matter your sex, no matter your religion, no matter what country you're from, no matter if you're rich or poor, no matter what, If you like music that will stur your soul, you WILL love this CD. I own it, and I thoroughly LOVE it.

B0001ADAVK|4.0|I'm just watched the DVD of this movie.  Unless if the theater version was different, did critics and I even watch the same movie?<br />Don't watch this expecting this to be like Dead Poet's Society.  Yes, one of the messages in the movie is about thinking for yourself, but the issues that college women had to deal with during that time are quite different from prep school boys.  Yes, this is somewhat of a chick flick, but at least it's not overly sappy chick flick.  I don't usually have much tolerance for sap.<br />I admit that I was not particularly happy with its portrayal of the school, as I am an alumna.  But from what i have been hearing about the time period, the issues the women faced in the movie were those that they had to face then.  I read somewhere that one of the reasons the story was set in Wellesley is that it's such an icon of the all women's college.  (Remember Working Girl with Sigourney Weaver and Melanie Griffith?)  As such, then, I'll let the exaggerations slide a little for artistic licence.  Same with the different girls being somewhat exaggerated characters.<br />It would have been nice if Joan had gone on to law school, but the fact that she at least made the application shows some progress.  Sometimes change happens slowly.  Maybe her daughter will go.  Or maybe she went on later.  We can hope.<br />I have mixed feelings about Katherine leaving.  I guess she left because under the conditions that she had to abide by, she couldn't be true to her beliefs.  I don't know whether I should interpret that as the administration having won, or she's standing her ground.<br /> That is not to say she didn't make a difference, however.  Yes, the change in Betty happens rather fast, but then again, given her previous beliefs, what she went through was rather traumatic.  The send off the girls gave to her, with the flowers and the bike scene, shows that she did make an impression, and that they are beginning to learn what she had to say.  But, as I saidbefore, some changes happen slowly.  The girls will get there eventually.  I confess.  I cried at the very end.<br />But, what exactly was the purpose of the Italian professor?  I think it would have been a better movie if he'd been more supportive of Katherine.  Then his presence in the movie would have served a better purpose.  Or, here's a thought.  Wouldn't Katherine have served as a better example if she had actually married her Californian boyfriend, and showed the girls how to balance work and family?  I didn't think she had all that great a reason for rejecting him.  So what was his purpose in the movie?<br />I'm thinking, though, the fact that people have talked about and written about this movie, good or bad, would suggest it struck a nerve.  A movie that'll get people to think about issues isn't all bad.  Based on the movie itself, with the weaknesses I pointed out, I think I'd actually give this a three and half.  But since we can only give whole stars, the last bit earned it the last half star.

B0000CABBW|5.0|_Whale Rider_ is one of the best movies I have seen this year.  The script and story were beautiful, and the cast was superb.  I greatly enjoyed learning more about the modern Maori, and about the legends of their people.  Keisha Castle-Hughes stole the show with her depiction of a young Maori girl who is looking for her place in the world.  I hope to see Miss Castle-Hughes in many other films: she is extremely talented.<br />The DVD has a very nice Behind-the-Scenes segment, as well as commentaries and still photos.  After seeing the movie, it was great to see how it was made, and more details about the director, and the actors.
B00013RC8O|5.0|Little can or needs to be added to the great reviews of this great movie.  In a word, the DVD is outstanding.

B00007M58G|5.0|This is to modern music what Revolver was to those who grew up listening to &quot;I want to hold your hand&quot;.  It is at first near on unlistenable, by the fourth time you like it, by tenth you feel the music, you know it, understand it, love it and could never go back.
B00005JN1L|3.0|Yet another Stephen King yarn (or, yawn) that shares such a striking resemblance to Misery that I had to look hard to confirm it wasn't. The only difference -- this writer is held captive in his *own* home by an obsessed fan who insists he rewrite the ending to an allegedly plagiarized novel.<br /><br />It's the sort of film that tries to wrap you up in its atmosphere and the anticipation of oh-so-terrifying events. Tension is the key, not violence and gore. I have to admit the tension does build well at the outset, with Depp playing a suitably rumpled and perplexed victim, and Turturro equally compelling as the nut-case on his trail. We feel the thriller that might just hold together.<br /><br />Sadly the cliches stack up at such rapid clip that we're soon wondering whether there's going to be a single original idea here. The answer comes in the inevitable twist which is neither surprising nor particularly fun.<br /><br />If you've seen a psychological thriller before, then Depp is perhaps the only reason to watch this forgettable excuse for a movie but even he is sleepwalking half the time..
B0000CFW87|5.0|This cd is by far the best I have ever purchased. His voice and emotion in ALL languages is extraordinary. Bacalov's, Il Postino brings me to tears. What a great talent and I am thankful he is sharing his gift.
B000001EC1|5.0|This 1994 collection is the only Bon Jovi CD many a fan will need.  Cross Road covers 10 songs coming from the first five albums, along with &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; from the Young Guns II soundtrack and 3 1994 tracks: Someday I'll be Saturday Night, Always, and Prayer '94 (a slower acoustic version of Livin' on a Prayer).  This is the only Bon Jovi hits package of the original recordings available.  Don't confuse the 2003 release &quot;This Left Feels Right: Greatest Hits with a Twist&quot; as a definitive greatest hits because its not original recordings, its experimental versions of all the hits which bare little resemblance to the orginal classics.  Pass it up unless you're a hardcore fan and even if you are, listen to samples first before spending money on it.  I can highly recommend Cross Road to anyone wanting all the best Bon Jovi tracks neatly compiled on a single disc.  Of course, since the band has released three albums since this collection, there may be another hits CD in the future, but as of now Cross Road is your best bet and captures Bon Jovi in all their 80s and 90s glory.
B000002UAX|5.0|The White album has got to be one of the best beatles albums ever! It is just so great, both sides have tracks anywhere from soft rock(Julia for example) to hard core head banging hits(helter skelter) if you like the beatles you'll love this album!
B000063DFN|5.0|My boyfriend was a big Maiden fan back in the 80s and that's sort of what hooked me onto them in the first place.  Not a bad track on this album at all.... it kicks freaking ass, especially Aces High and The Duellists.  Classic Maiden for everyone.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I buy a lot of HBO show seasons on DVD.  This is the first non-HBO show I've bought.  Plots are fun, not always airtight.  They do sometimes take the western part of space-western too far:  the bonnets drive me crazy.  I still think the show deserves 5 stars.<P>It's the characters that makes the show work: great cast, great writing, and careful development over time.  When a character said &quot;And I can kill you with my mind&quot; I laughed my pigu off.  You'll have to watch the series to understand.  It's a show you can watch over and over and always see something new.
B00018TI5E|5.0|What a shock. I was really pleased with the Cali pop rock leanings of the last RHCP album and this record confirms the genius behind that sound.  (Check out his website to hear three songs in full.)<br />&quot;Carvel&quot; is my current favorite among a large batch of great songs.  This record is a grower, getting better with each listen. It is also a record that will make fans proud.  After some rough years, this man will finally get the artistic acclaim he deserves.  This record is smart, challenging and full of heart.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Of course,all 27 of these songs hit number 1,but its interesting to see how some of these stormed up to the number 1 spot and held on to that spot with a vengence- I want to hold your hand,number 1 for seven weeks, She loves you number 1 for 6 weeks, Yesterday number 1 for 4 weeks, Get back for 5 weeks,day tripper for 4 weeks,Hey jude for a incredible 9 weeks,From me to you 7 weeks,Hello goodbye 7 weeks... no wonder &quot;1&quot; is still on the charts some 175 weeks after release!
B0000C6E4D|3.0|Well, a little disappointing. It's a great CD, but just an OK sarah mclachlan cd. The cd is almost over before you even start. before you know it, you're hearing &quot;fallen&quot; again. not as good as past efforts, but does have it's moments. ps- how funny is it with the reviews that review each song individually!?! gotta love that, won't find that here.
B00005V1B1|4.0|well im a big fan of prog rock, and i happend to like camel, now this album is pretty good, it has a nice appeal to it but its not one of my favorite though, the snow goose was better, maybe because it had no lyrics, but still a good sloid effort by this english dudes, if you like prog rock you must have this album!!! (nice cover by the way)
B00005JMJ4|1.0|My title pretty much says it all.  My husband and I love Bill Murray and were very excited about seeing this movie.  My husband couldn't even stay awake during the film and ended up going to bed.  I am a die hard and figured the movie would &quot;get good&quot; eventually.  NOT!!!  I was so disappointed when the movie was over.  It never got better.  My six year old could have written a better plot.  I felt like I had just wasted my time...as much as I hate doing laundry, I found myself wishing I had done just that instead. <br />Basically it is a very snail paced movie about an unhappy comedian who feels unloved/un-needed by his wife.  He goes to Japan to do a commercial for alocohol, is very bored, meets a newly married woman who is also very bored since her husband is not around to see Japan with her (he is a musician and is doing gigs in Japan).  So the two bored people hang out together.  They sing very boring karaoke, meet at a strip club then leave, eat out together, then she gets upset when she finds him in bed with another woman, forgives him the next day, then they say bye when he leaves to go back home to his wife and kids.  That's pretty much the whole movie, but they take around 2 hours to show it...there are a lot of scenes with one or the other of them staring off into space.  <br />Don't waste your MONEY or TIME.
B00003CXXS|1.0|I enjoyed the first two Jurassic Park movies but Jurassic Park 3 was just flat out horrible, and in my opinion one of the worst movie I have see in quite sometime. The special effects were huge come down from the last two and there was no story, Just a series of scenes that were cut together and called a movie. <br />Get the first two movies, and stay away from part 3.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I rarely see a big screen movie that makes me feel like I get my money's worth. MASTER AND COMMANDER was a great exception to this rule. I had not read O'Brian's books, but the masterful performance given especially by Crowe and the way Weir pulls his audience into the action made me go out and get the first book. I am now half way through the series of 20, unable to put them down from start to finish. Although the movie is a combination of good parts from the books, the essence of the characters are well preserved and the general flavor of O'Brian's stories are well presented. It would have been a monumental task to tell all the tales of Aubrey & Maturin, something that could only be done justice in words, and not pictures. This movie is a wonderful introduction to the world and works of O'Brian--it is an appetizer to be followed by a wonderful main course of the written tales.
B00018D44U|2.0|Dull, lackluster, and lifeless.  The picture in this CD's packaging material says it all:  There is wan, little Norah looking sad at the back of the room, while in the foreground nameless musicians dominate the scene.  I hope she gets to be front-and-center again soon.
B00012QM86|4.0|WAITED FOREVER FOR ONE OF MY FAVORITE AND TRULY EMOTIONAL MOVIES TO COME OUT ON DVD. HOWEVER, I AM QUITE SURPRISED AND VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT DIRECTOR STEVEN SPIELBERG WHO IS MAYBE ONE OF THE BEST KNOWN CINEMA PERFECTIONISTS DID ONE THING THAT SHOCKED THE HELL OUT OF ME. THE DVD HAS TO BE TURNED OVER AND YOU HAVE TO LITERALLY GET UP OUT OF YOUR CHAIR, STOP IT AND TURN THE DVD OVER TO PLAY THE REST OF THE MOVIE AND SEE THE BONUS SELECTIONS. THIS MADNESS UPSET ME SINCE I HAVE A DVD HOME THEATER SYSTEM THAT HAS THE CAPABILITY OF A CAROUSEL WITH 6 DVD SLOTS YOU CAN USE. I ALSO THINK THE STUDIO MADE A REAL &quot;BOO BOO&quot; ON MINE SINCE BOTH SIDES SAY SIDE &quot;B&quot; ON EITHER SIDE WHICH MAKES IT CONFUSING ON WHICH SIDE IS TO BE PLAYED FIRST. I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR BACK FROM ANYONE ELSE WHO HAS THIS MISTAKE ON THEIR DVD. I THINK I ORDERED THE WIDESCREEN BUT WAS SENT THE FULL SCREEN WHICH TO ME SOMETIMES MATTERS. IS THERE ANY DIFFERENCE ON TURNING THE DVD OVER ON THE FULL OR WIDESCREEN VERSIONS. IS THE SPECIAL EDITION WHERE YOU GET THE DVD, THE ORIGINAL CD SOUNDTRACK AND THE PLEXIGLASS COVER DIFFERENT? I MEAN DO YOU STILL HAVE TO TURN THE DVD OVER OR DO YOU GET TWO DISCS IN THE SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S VERSION? I WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW THIS IF ANYONE WANTS TO TELL ME THIS.<br />In any case, getting back to the movie, the movie is still powerful, the acting is superb and you can watch it over and over again and you will cry at the anguish these victims of pure bigotry and semitism suffered. No people should ever have to suffer such cruelty. I am Jewish and proud of it. But no matter who you are or what your faith is, everyone and anyone should watch this movie to remind you that these injustices are just a moment away. Just look at what is happening in the world today? Religion makes fools of men..... and murderers as well....Bravo to Steven Spielberg but there should have been 2 discs on this very important and powerful movie, so not to break the continuity......Thanks for reading my critique...reading my critique...
B0000AQVCL|1.0|I thought to myself &quot;Hmmm maybe I could rewrite a George Thorogood song and make a quick buck too&quot;<br />Honestly, if you're a classic rock fan, as I am, why listen to a cheap imitation when you can listen to the real deal? Why take Sierra Mist over Sprite? Why watch the Psycho remake when you can see the original Alfred Hitchcock film? Why choose Webster over Arnold from Different Strokes?<br />Don't support plagarism, go to your local store and buy albums by the bands that it made it possible for crap like Jet, the Darkness and Kings of Leon to exist in the first place. Don't let dumb retro nostalgia trends, brought about by the already crappy state of fake grunge and nu metal, dictate what's cool to listen to and what's not.<br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I hear the Stooges' Fun House calling me from my stereo.....

B000068VHP|4.0|This is a great album of the Cranberries' but it's definitely not quite the same caliber as say, No Need to Argue or To the Faithful Departed. In some ways this album seems a lot more shallow, a lot less variety and experimentation, but if that's more your style of the Cranberries' songs, you will enjoy this one. The songs are a lot less political and a more limited subject matter is in this CD. Her voice doesn't really have the same fluctuating quality from song to song as does in the other two albums I own, and neither is the music better in comparison. I would recommend the other two aforementioned in place of this one, but there are some very good ones, such as &quot;Sunday&quot; (slow beginning, spontaneously upbeat, awesome instrumental of strings). I don't think the Cranberries really let themselves go until their next albums. (In the midst of all these love-elation-and-despair songs you almost can't distinguish the Irish accent until the &quot;linger&quot; in Linger is a jarring realization of their heritage, though that's beside the point. )Great, but could be better.

B00004TLN3|3.0|We all know that the BBC, with some funding from A&E, could do a great adaptation of this film (hint, hint)!  But since they don't seem to be interested in doing that, fans of the Jane Austen novel this film is based on, will have to refer to this made-for-British-TV version for a quick Northanger Abbey 'fix'.<br />Which is not a bad way to describe the nature of this film.  Its screenplay is the bare bones of JA's classic novel, which leaves much of her satire, -- not to mention her witty dialogue,-- out.  What was an intriguing and entertaining satire on the popular Gothic novels of its time, was made into a dreamlike, slightly creepy, light romance.  Entertaining for what it is; deeply satisfying it is not. However, there are good things about this film, that JA fans will enjoy. <br />The biggest of these is the strength of the film's cast.  The acting is superb, and the actors well suited to their roles.  Peter Firth is perfectly charming as Henry Tilney, and though deprived of some of JA's better lines from the novel, conveys those he has with just the right passion for a romantic hero.  And the heroine, played wonderfully by Katharine Schlesinger, is just as the novel imagined, innocent and eager to greet the world, all wide eyes and innocence.  The supporting cast is also fine, especially Googie Withers as Mrs. Allen, and the Thorpe siblings.  <br />Other high points are the lush and colorful costumes, and the vivid and romantic setting.   All the opulence of dress from the 1790's, the novel's timeframe, is preserved, including piles of curls on the head, and garrish make-up.  The Roman bath scene is a unique and interesting look at what one of the popular health spas of yesterday were like.  And in spite of the inappropriateness of substituting a castle for an abbey, who wouldn't want to be a guest in one like this, or think it a likely place for adventure and romance for the heroine of a Gothic tale, which Catherine Morland so wants to be?  <br />There havebeen just complaints about this film.  The soundtrack is a departure from the JA film norm, and takes some getting used to.  John Thorpe is a leering villian, instead of a bumbling fool, as in the novel.  The Gothic daydream scenes are sometimes jarring and even disturbing, different from the novel's lighter, satirical tone.  But overall these little quirks, along with others, seem to work, within the peculiar context of the film's truncated, but still Gothic and romantic, world.  Even the Marchioness's strange appearance adds a pinch of dream flavor to this Gothic soup.<br />This film is probably best viewed as its own entity, and not as an adaptation of the novel.  For JA fans, a more faithful version is needed (please!) but this has strong parts enough for occasional viewing as a curiosity (or just to give the Pride and Prejudice dvd a rest)!  Like the Gothic romance novels of Mrs. Radcliffe, which this film in part satirizes, it should be enjoyed by quick consumption, and like that list of laundry bills in a mysterious, old trunk, not too seriously.

B00005JMJ4|2.0|I loved Bill Murray in this movie and Scarlett Johansson was very good too.

B0001US8EO|5.0|Way more realistic and less flamboyant than the previous Kurt Russel movie Tombstone. Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp is a far more engaging and entertaining, not to mention believable .  Unfortunately for warner Brothers it was released about six months after Tombstone and people for the most part did not want to see \\"another\\" Wyatt Earp movie.  With an absolutely all-star cast, this is a movie that you do not want to miss.
0790730960|5.0|&quot;Batman Returns&quot; fully surpasses the original,&quot;Batman&quot;(1989),<BR>in every which way imaginable.The story,though complex,is understandable and well crafted,and isn't just there as a fill-in for the intense action scenes.Michael Keaton reprises his role<BR> as Batman/Bruce Wayne,as do Michael Gough(Alfred)and Pat<BR>Hingle(Commissioner Gordon)for their roles.The new cast,which features Danny Devito(The Penguin),Michelle Pfieffer(Catwoman),and Christopher Walken(Max Shreck),are all perfect for their roles.My only complaint is the size of Gotham City,which is much too small and bears little resemblence to the city in its predecessor.Most of the outdoor scenes are centered around &quot;Gotham Plaza&quot;,a tiny Rocafeller Center rip-off.But,you can't let a small flaw like that discourage you.So,buy this DvD and enjoy the great story,the wonderful acting,and the fantastic ending(Catwoman lives!!),which leaves you wanting more.Its just a shame none of its sequels fully deliver.

B00005JL0U|5.0|This is one of the two greatest music video compilations I've ever seen since I started to enjoy the Western Pop music. Another one is certainly \\"Making Of Thriller\\". However it's so strange that the damned SONY doesn't yet have the intention even today to release these two as DVD format! If somebody tells me there are no more requests for these \\"old\\" videos among Michael's fans or any music lovers, it's not the truth. I just hope someone can give me a reason!
B0001ADAVK|3.0|I have to say that Julia Roberts is definitely, without a doubt, one of the most talented actresses and can carry a film not so well written with ease.  Julia Roberts just steals the scene from all the other actresses who are pretty much invisible with no interesting characters portrayals. The film has a good story to it but the script was very poor and if it weren't for Julia's natural brilliant talent and her beauty, (she just radiates it with her smile, she eats the lenses), the film would not have done as decent as it did. It has a good message but just not well filmed nor thought out.  Julia definitely deserves the pay she gets for lifting this movie.
0375713751|5.0|I see a lot of negative reviews here, but I think this book is hilarious and very real.  It may seem to some like it has a feminist agenda, but if you have ever worked in a high-pressure business (as the heroine does) you will have experienced some of the frustrations of trying to compete with men who have stay-at-home wives, or have tried to ignore sexual jokes during meetings, or rushed from work to school to home.  I loved reading about a woman a little like me, who is over 20 and is trying to DO IT ALL.  It is not preachy, just very funny and very true - and the revenge she exacts on a particularly vile coworker at the end of the novel is WONDERFUL.  Does she make the right decision at the end of the story?  You read it and decide for yourself.
B000002WYT|5.0|This, of course might not be DMB's most audacious material, but it is the one I enjoy the most.  The band stands right in the middle of the jazzy musical proposal they offer, and commercial $implicity (lately in demand) . You can either listen to great tunes and sweet melodies or admire the arrangements and the versatility of their jams. Great lyrics too. I'd say this should be DMB's signature style.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|For me, this film would have had much greater dramatic impact had director Anthony Minghella not attempted to cover too much, or if that coverage had been in sharper focus and more cohesive. Adapted by him from Charles Frazier's novel Cold Mountain, his film examines<br /><br />* a Civil War South variation on Odysseus's return to Ithaca<br /><br />* an implausible romance between Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law)<br /><br />* the horrors of war which largely explain Inman's desertion (for many of the same reasons why John Dunbar flees from \\"civilization\\" in Dances with Wolves)<br /><br />* an estranged, indeed dysfunctional relationship between Ruby (Renee Zellweger) and her father Stobrod Thewes (Brendan Gleeson)<br /><br />* the abusive and oppressive, at times vicious Home Guard in the Cold Mountain (NC) area under the absolute control of Teague (Ray Winstone)<br /><br />* Ada's severely difficult adjustment to the Civil War's impact on her and her father, as well as her struggles to keep her farm<br /><br />Of course, there are also several related story lines (sub plots, actually) but these six receive most of Zinghella's attention. As indicated earlier, I think he attempts to cover too much within the parameters of a commercial film, even one with a running time of 155 minutes which this one has.<br /><br />Ada and Inman spend almost no time together before he departs for the war. They are indeed an odd couple: she is a reticent, cultured, proper beauty (the archetypical Southern Belle) and he is also reticent, almost to the point of being mute but lacks her culture and refinement. As I observed their brief and awkward interaction in the film, there seemed to be almost no chemistry between them, perhaps because there was little chemistry between Kidman and Law. My hunch (only a hunch) is that Inman's revulsion to the horrors of war rather than his attraction to Ada explains his obsession to return \\"home.\\" That is, what he flees is a much greater motivation than is what (who) awaits him. One man's opinion.<br /><br />All that said, I think Zellweger deserved her Academy Award for best actress in a supporting role. I also think the cinematography (John Seale) and musical score (Gabriel Yared) are especially effective. The opening sequence which includes a defining moment, indeed an epiphany for Inman, is masterfully presented. It invites comparisons with the final sequence in Glory. Cold Mountain has memorable moments and some excellent performances. For reasons indicated, however, I think the film falls short of greatness for many of the same reasons that other recent films have. (Gangs of New York, for example.) More often than not, less really can be more.All that said, I think Zellweger deserved her Academy Award for best actress in a supporting role.

B00004WG2X|3.0|I bought this version because I love Pride and Prejudice and thought I would enjoy any version. I must have been spoiled by the 1995 A&amp;E version, because this one seemed so amateur.<BR>  <BR>The actors were stiff, especially David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy.  &quot;A viewer from il&quot; described him well; acting as though he had a wedgie and couldn't wait for everyone to leave so he could pick it!  That really made me laugh because it is true.  He walked around as if he had a steel rod for a spine.  In one of my favorite P&amp;P scenes, Darcy's proposal, both David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvie recited their lines without expression. It was like they had practiced a thousand times, were tired of it, and were speaking fast to get it over with. In the 1995 version of this scene, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle both express emotion in their their voices and facial expressions; it is a wonderfully enjoyable scene. Garvie as Elizabeth Bennet seems quieter and more serious, whereas Ehle as Elizabeth is playful and has sparkling eyes.  Garvie's Elizabeth walks around with a prissy fringed parasol which looks like it came from Caroline Bingley's closet.<BR>  <BR>Several of the other characters were also better cast in the A&amp;E version.  Susannah Harker was better as Jane because of her natural beauty and sweetness.  The Jane in this 1980 version looked like a 1980's beauty with her dark eyebrows and eyeliner.  In Jane Austen's time she would have been considered a painted woman.  David Bamber as Mr. Collins in the 95 A&amp;E version was pompous and slimy, whereas the Mr. Collins in this 1980 version is just a big goof, even likable.  I definitely prefer the 1995 A&amp;E version.  The casting in that one is near perfect, and expresses Jane Austen's novel so well.  If you love that version, you may not like this one.
0385504209|3.0|While DavVinci Code keep its promise of puzzle after puzzle, it has a disappointing &quot;continuous car chase&quot; in the first third of the book.  The ending was quite a let down.<br />Angels and Demons was far superior in its richness and art with spectacular scenes as well as scenery.  Lets hope Dan's next novel doesn't disappoint as much as this one.  I love Robert Langdon and hope we get to see him again soon.
B000002J09|5.0|regardless if you are a zeppelin fan, or a rock fan, you must have this album just as a music fan. This is definitely one big masterpiece.<br />Needless to say, it's an album that you can listen from begining to end and enjoy it throughly. Every song in here deserves to be a single in it's own special way.<br />It rocks hard (Black dog), it rocks fast (rock n' roll), and it mellows down (Going to California)and calms down(Misty Mountain Top). It's just a perfect rock album from beggining to end.<br />Jimmy Page's guitar work is as usual masterfull, bluesy, hard rocking, and great acustic work too. Same applies to the bass lines. The drumming is so hard it puts this record on the hard rock category by itself, just listen to &quot;when the levee breaks&quot; and Robert Plants unmistakable vocal range still amazes. He puts his heart and soul on this songs and you can feel it too.<br />Highlights: the whole album... and yes, Stairway is a masterpiece on it's own!!!

The fact that I was able to read it at all, let alone in 2 weeks is worthy of a couple of stars in my book.  The ending is ridiculous though.  I was annoyed at far too many &quot;just in the nick of time&quot; saves throughout the made-for-Hollywood ending.  As far as the reviews calling the plot &quot;implausible&quot; etc, it IS an action thriller piece of FICTION afterall.  Cut the guy some slack.

In the case of Overkill, this is it.<br />It's fast as hell, heavy as hell, loud as hell, and even scary at parts, all this components make it a metal masterpiece. From begining to end, this album is what you want it to be = thrash metal.<br />Musically it's even like, dare to say, early Pantera kinda heavy, while the vocals drive the difference they are high pitched, loud and fearless. The tempos are neck breaking, I love the tempo and time signature changes which make this album interesting and fun to listen to.<br />you like metal, you must have this.<br />Highlights: Horrorscope, Thanx for Nothing
0321146530|3.0|This Kent Beck title is an introduction to the world of Test-Driven Development (TDD).  The book teaches the concepts of TDD by working through two complete sample projects.  Along the way, Beck gives the reader valuable insight into the thought process and techniques behind successful test-driven development.  When the reader has finished working through these sample projects, he should know enough about TDD to get started working on a TDD project.<br />The book is divided into three sections.  The first two sections are each walkthroughs of the aforementioned sample projects using TDD.  The third section is a collection of notes and useful tips to try to get the most out of TDD.  If you've ever read anything from Beck, then you should be familiar with his style.  If you haven't, Beck is an engaging enough writer, and the text flows smoothly and is fairly pleasant to read.<br />It would help to be familiar with some member of the xUnit family prior to reading this book.  Beck uses Java and JUnit for the first section, but never really goes into discussing the JUnit API.  Readers unfamiliar with xUnit may have no idea how to proceed with writing their own tests using one of these frameworks.  True the API is simple enough that its functions may be ascertained simply by reading the code, but this is no reason not to provide explanation.  The second sample project is an actual implementation of xUnit, so a bit more information may be gleaned here.  Beck made the curious decision to use Python as the language of implementation for the second project, although he does provide explanation of the language's fundamentals.  Finally, none of the sample projects are really complicated enough to do more than get us going on the path of TDD.  There will still be many hurdles to climb when working on a real-world project.<br />If you are seeking a basic introduction to test-driven development, then you might enjoy this title.  If you are a Java developer interested in exploringTDD more in-depth, there are better books out there.
B0000041Q3|1.0|Why would a singer that had some great, even some monumental recordings under his belt (Fille du Regiment) do something like this?  Oh, I know, money.<br />Luciano Pavarotti was blessed with a great voice, but NOT a voice for singing Calaf.  If you want to know how Puccini wanted his Calaf to sound find a recording of Giacomo Lauri Volpi or one of Franco Corelli.  Fleta did the opening night of this Puccini's swan song, but he was wise enough not to sing it again (no recordings of Fleta on this role are available); I wish Pavarotti and other singers would have learned a lesson from Miguel Fleta.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Ok, seeing how I own 18 of the 27 commercially released Queen albums I should write a review for this \\"collection\\".<br /><br />Let's just get the first two cd's out of the way.  They are the only reason this review gets 5 stars.  A great collection of Queen music can be found on the first two cd's, but you can get those same two cd's cheaper thatn paying for this box set.<br />Ok.  Now, let's move on to the abyssmal third cd.  To put it mildly, this cd sucks.  Why?  It's a bad attempt to cash in on the Queen name, YET AGAIN, but instead of offering us something good, we get a big pile of garbage.<br /><br />For starters, to label this a \\"Queen\\" cd is a bit of an overstatement.  This CD consists, mainly, of other people singing Queen songs from the Freddie Mercury benefit show in 1992, a few Freddie solo songs, a HORRIFIC Wyclef Jean remake of Another One Bites The Dust, Brian May's Driven By You single and only one TRUE Queen song (These Are The Days of Our Lives).<br />No One But You was put together some six years after Freddie passed.  Now, the third cd offers nothing a real Queen fan wants to hear.  Especially since you can get all of Freddie's solo work on CD now (The Solo Collection) and if you want to hear George Michael singing Queen, pick up the Five Live EP.<br /><br />Take my advice.  if you want a good \\"starter\\" Queen cd, go get Queen Rocks.  All the hits, a few misses and put together quite well.  If you want some of the best Queen cd's, check out Innuendo, The Works, Queen, Queen II and Live Killers.  Check those cd's out and if you are not a Queen fan afterwards, you will never be.<br /><br />Finally, for the American fans, try listening to something other than We Will Rock You, Another One Bites The Dust, Under Pressure, We Are The Champions and Bohemian Rhapsody.  Queen has so much more out there than those few American \\"hits\\".  Give Dragon Attack, Innuendo, It's A Hard Life or Sleeping on the Sidewalk a chance.  You wont regret it.t.
0060920432|5.0|Csikszentmihalyi's \\"Flow\\" is to *psychological* capital what Robert Putnam's \\"Bowling Alone\\" is to *social* capital.  These classics present two of the most useful theories ever to come out of the social sciences; they are blueprints for improving lives and building better societies.  A more recent title by Csikszentmihalyi, \\"The Evolving Self,\\" explores implications of flow theory for civilization and culture.  Gallwey's \\"Inner Game of Work\\" is a good follow-up to reading Csikszentmihalyi.  Flow isn't something you can afford to stay in the dark about.
B0000584V3|5.0|After reading tons of reviews, I bought this album, and extremely pleased with it. There is quite no band like Opeth; I know that sounds cliched, but this time, I cannot find any band which shares Opeth's sound, as well as their intelligent song writing skills. I dislike death metal in general, but don't be put off by Opeth's (subjective) label as progressive death metal, they are truely an unique band. Of course, Mikael uses the death metal style vocals, but when he uses them, he uses them very, very well. Never is a moment in the album where I get sick of them. He also has a beautiful &quot;clean&quot; voice, which he beautifully shows in Bleak, the second track.<br />Onto the songs themselves, first is The Leper Affinity. At the first few listens, I was puzzeled by its harshness and lack of &quot;delicacy&quot;, but it's very well constructed. Over-lapping guitar riffs add character to the song, and make the song dynamic and flows from one passage to another. An emotional, and well pieced solo from Steven Wilson (I think) ends the song.<br />Bleak in next, and in my opinion, the best song on the album by far. It begins with, you could say, mid-eastern influenced riffs, and explodes into Mikael's tough vocals. Then the rythm changes, and Mikael sings, &quot;Break of morning, coldness lingers on, shroud me into nightmares of the sun&quot;, which never fails to move me. The same lyrical format repeats (albeit with different words, obviously), and the song only gets better from there. The chorus, beginning with &quot;Devious movements in your eyes,&quot; is beautifully sung cleanly, as I previously mentioned. I forgot to mention the many different passages this song takes, changing tempo and volume, which are highly effective and again, add Opeth's own unique-ness. The song also has a couple guitar &quot;solos&quot;, where the effect used on them is just effective. I can't describe it, but Mikael is a genius at adding things to a song to make it stand out. The song ends with a repeated chorus, and afterwards &quot;Slight twist, shivering corpse... this is all you need.&quot; Wow. I found the &quot;slight twist&quot; part very comical, since the way it's been mixed and sung, it was a big twist coming on from the chorus of the song. Sorry if I don't make any sense here, but you'll have to listen to it to understand.<br />Harvest is next, a lighter song with layers of guitars, which create a soothing and somewhat &quot;cold&quot; effect. Clean vocals throughout, and some nice guitar touches, which finish of the song. An interesting piece, but I wouldn't say it's better than &quot;good&quot;; for Opeth, anyway. The Drapery Falls is probably the song which introduced me to Opeth, and eventhough I don't enjoy it as much as I did before, it's still a very good song. The riffs are repeated, and so are some of the vocals. This is probably one of the most repetitive songs in Blackwater Park. I can say that Mikael's (clean) vocals to &quot;Pull me down again and guide me into ah-ah...&quot; are extremely original, and enjoyable to listen to. The song then turns heavier, and accompanied by Lopez's fast drumming, death metal style vocals turn on and fill up the rest of the song; but not before some clean passages which break up the middle of it. A better than average song, but not the best.<br />Dirge for November is the next track, and is probably the albums most emotional and beautiful track. Forgive my ignorance, but it's either the keyboard or guitar riffs that stand out here, right at the start of the song and before the end. The end solo creates a mental image of sadness, desperation and moves you into tears. I think that when a piece of music has the power to do that, it's worth checking out.<br />The Funeral Portrait, I haven't heard too much of, neither the title track, so I refuse to comment on those; however The Funeral Portrait doesn't seem to be as aesthetically pleasing as the other tracks, but ignore this advice now, since itwill probably grow on me since. I forgot to mention my surprise of the lyrics in the album; they're highly interesting to read over, and show Mikael's large vocabulary.<br />I urge you buy this album, it's a MUST in your collection. Any fan of good music will love this.
0345440900|5.0|I'm really surprised by the negative reviews of this book!  I had read several other books and didn't get the help I needed.  Tracy's book helped me with a difficult infant.  He nursed every two hours around the clock for the first three months ... and experienced moms know that means you have about an hour's break in between to sleep, go to the bathroom, eat a meal, take a shower, write thank you notes, visit with family and friends, throw in a load of laundry, etc. I was barely functioning as a human being.  Getting the nursing started was extremely difficult and for some reason, the lactation consultants I talked to weren't able to help me, the baby cried a lot (everyone called it colic), he wouldn't sleep well, etc.  When I read Tracy's book and worked my baby onto the E.A.S.Y. schedule, he was so much happier.  He needed the predictability of knowing what was coming next in this new unknown world.  Plus, Tracy helped me learn to interpret his different cries (hungry, tired, tummyache, etc.) and be more aware of his cues.  She also loosely categorizes babies into personality types and gives ideas for how to deal with different babies' needs.  This helped me recognize that my baby was very sensitive and was easily overstimulated by noise and toys and visitors and I could adjust accordingly.<br />As far as the comments about Tracy being negative about breastfeeding, I read the book and breastfed and don't remember being offended by anything she said, although I had decided before reading the book that breastfeeding was the best choice for me.  She was very honest that breastfeeding is much harder than most first-time moms expect.  I was glad to have some validation that it is really tough to train yourself and the baby.  I wish I had known that ahead of time so I wouldn't have been so discouraged.  <br />I'm wondering if the people who posted negative reviews had relatively easy babies or maybe were more experienced moms who didn't need some help getting started.At any rate, I found the book to be a life-saver for my sanity, and my baby was much happier after I practiced some of Tracy's tips.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I liked the story and animation in the movie.  But hated the crew.  I'm sick of Marvel and there bad casting jobs.  Pick somebody off the street that looks like daredevil or the king pin, not somebody that doesn't suit the role.  Marvel has so much money and talent and they waste it on a bad cast.(exception, X-men and blade).  Get a director that really knows the story and the characters and then pick the cast.  The acting in the movie isn't too bad but they don't fit the profile.  That's why I'm rating it out of 3.  If I ever got in the movie business, I would direct good comic movies instead of the crap they're making.
B000127LW2|5.0|The first season of Star Trek: Voyager was a brave and bold venture for the creators of Star Trek, but it proved to be a worthwhile investment to a series that would soon become one of the most popular Star Treks ever. The first four of the five DVDs have newly remastered 5.1 surround sound; it's almost like watching the season in a whole new way. The video quality is astounding. Disc 5, the special features, give an extensive and interesting perspective into the creation of this season. The segment about Bujold being the first Janeway was absolutely amazing. Interesting tidbits are also hidden throughout the menus which include interesting information such as guest star interviews and the evolution of Janeway's hair (can you believe they originally filmed 'Caretaker' with her hair down?). This DVD set clearly does justice to Star Trek: Voyager Season 1, and is well worth the price.
B00005JKC3|2.0|This movie had some good acting and digital animation but came out lame.  Why?  Because of the corney events that happened in the movie.  Ex. the crazy man eating dogs, hulk jumping miles high in the air, and hulks father turning into a giant electrical monster near the end of the movie.  What the hell were they thinking.  Didn't any of them say, this sounds sorts of corney.  Rent but don't buy this movie because there's to much talk and you'll probably be put to sleep by it.  The best Marvel movies are X-men and blade.  The rest have great graphics and some good acting but come out short.  Image comics should start coming out with some good movies.  Darkness would be my first pick.

B00008J4P5|1.0|Simply put this album BLOWS!! , It's got no flow to it , the songs are awful , boring and monotous and not to mention the low musical abiltity of these two , they make old school punk bands look like \\"accomplished \\" musicians . Why this band gets so much praise is beyond me , If you want simple music that rocks buy a Ramones , Clash , Sex Pistols or Misfits album , you want Hard Rock , get into Iron Maiden , Megadeath , GNR , Led Zep or any other real good band . This album is seriously like watching you're money burn so unless you like doing that ,stay away from this garbage rock .
B000127LW2|3.0|I was expecting a lot about the surround sound from this set; a bit like star trek movies.<BR>After all sf is really the show to place all kinds of surround sounds.<BR>I know that the serie is not new but I was expecting a remix or sort of.<BR>Well, after seeing 2 dvds out of 5, nothing so far, everything is in the front, nothing ( or allmost) in the rear.<BR>I'm really deceived!
B00011RPB0|5.0|I loved this movie and anyone that has travelled abroad will get this movie so well.  This movie gives those that relate a sense of deja vu while watching which may be why I was so drawn to this movie while others not.  I have been alone in a foreign country with the wish of a 'jail break' and the need to find someone with the same background as I.  <BR>Important to note is for fans of this movie, check out engrish.com   Things definently get 'lost in translation'
0385720920|5.0|Choke was a great novel! This was the first book i read of Chuck Palahniuks. I loved his writing style, ive never read anything like it.  It is very fast paced and has you going in a bunch of different directions at once, which i liked alot.  I loved the storyline it was very clever, i mean who would think of someone that chokes on food to make someone a hero, pure genius.  I would recomend this book to anyone i think everyone would enjoy it tremendously.  I'm definitly going to read other Chuck Palahniuk novels.
B0000062GE|4.0|I have loved this band since high school.  The emotions expressed through the music helped through the tough transition from high school to college and also through the transition of relationships.  Although I do have to wonder about something...a girl at the ballet studio where I dance claims she knows the lead singer and he is happy as a lark.  Have to wonder about that.  Many would pass her claim off as false but the other mystery here is that a vast majority of the people I have grown up with have never heard the likes of this band since it is not popular here.  Guess she could have picked an unknown band to lie about so people would not be too suspicious.  Anyone else know him?  <BR>    Back to the topic at hand, great album, best track is the last one and Sometimes it Hurts but that is my opinion of course.  It didn't get five stars because there are two tracks I don't like and skip through.
6305878323|5.0|...she's calling to you.<br />In my mind, this movie is the reason why Disney is great.  The rest of them - however good many of them may be - don't hold a candle (on the water) to this wonderful Disney masterpiece.  This is easily my favorite Disney movie ever and one of my favorite movies of all time.<br />One of the things I love most about this movie is the fact that there's plenty of entertainment here for children; but there's also a lot of humor for adults.  So, when the children grow up, they can have just as much, if not more, appreciation for the film.  I love the way the satire starts out.  Mrs. Banks comes home from her Sister Suffragettes Rally, shouting and singing for women's rights and equality with men<br />(\\"Though we adore men individually,<br />We agree that as a group<br />They're rather stupid.\\").<br />Then Mr. Banks comes home from work singing about the pleasures of being a man in this age in England:<br />\\"It's grand to be an Englishman in 1910.<br />King Edward's on the throne;<br />It's the age of men!<br />I'm the lord of my castle!<br />The sovereign!<br />The liege!\\"<br />I still love the thought of a house which sports a naval cannon deck on top.  And I have to confess when I was a child I did try the finger snap to see if it would get my room clean.  (It didn't work, so I just grew up in a messy room.)<br />The fantastic acting performances by Julie Andrews (who received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress - back in the days when the person who won was usually the person who deserved to win), the children, Dick Van Dyke, David Tomlinson, Glynnis Johns, Jane Darwell (though her part was very small), and the rest - cannot be overstated.  I have already said that this is Disney's best film.  Well, it is also boasts the finest acting ever in a Disney film.<br />I highly recommend purchasing this in the Widescreen format.  You will see a lot more of the picture than in the standard format.  Unfortunately, the widescreen version is out ofprint (you can still buy them used; that's how I got mine); and it looks like the standard version may also be going out of print soon.  Hopefully, that means there will be a special deluxe edition with both formats, documentaries, commentaries, etc. coming out soon.
B00008EY9G|5.0|I saw this movie the day it was released in theatres...being a mystery buff I knew I had to see it.  I literally sat for the full time and it felt like only ten minutes.  This movie keeps you so wrapped in the plot you can not think of anything else.  It is well paced and does not lull or become boring.  My only complaint is that they did make a teensy mistake with the classification of multiple personality disorder, they stated it to be on the wrong axis of the DSM-IV.  Would have thought that kind of thing would be checked.<BR>     I do want to note that the Starz feature on the DVD and the directors comments are particularly notable if you are a film buff and if not.  The diretor points out a lot of interesting lighting choices and camera angles that I would have never noticed without it being pointed out.  Two thumbs up and if you are a mystery/suspence genre fan see this.
0141301066|5.0|Matilda<BR>By: Roald Dahl<BR>Reviewd By : J. Lee<BR>Period: P.1 <BR>This story was about an intelligent girl named Matilda. She wasn't loved or noticed by her family. Her father was a crook, all her mother loved to do was play bingo, and her brother got all the attention. Matilda is like a genius, but only young of age. Her parents just thought that she was a little girl that should not be heard or seen. They used her as an excuse of everything wrong that went on in their lives. But that became worse when she was sent to Crunchem Hall Primary. Her teacher, Miss Honey, was a sweet person that loved little children, but the headmistress of the school, the \\"Trunchbull\\", was the problem. Aside from Matilda's parents, Miss Trunchbull was the other person that blamed Matilda for everything that went wrong in her life. Miss Trunbull wasn't only the headmistress of the school, but was also an ex-Olympic hammer thrower. The only person who actually cared of and noticed Matilda's intelligence was her teacher, Miss Honey. At first, Miss Honey was puzzled by how much Matilda knew, but later, she brought text books from the older classes for Matilda since Miss Trunchbull wouldn't let her move up. Matilda became closer to Miss Honey and she became to know more of her. One day in class, Matilda found something amazing about herself. She was able to move objects with her eyes. She was at first surprised, but later, got used to it, and soon, she had a great idea. The day Miss Trunchbull came to teach the class, Matilda played a little prank on Miss Trunchbull, and that caused Miss Trunchbull to return everything in her posession to Miss Honey, who was the true owner. Matilda's family had to move to Spain, and because she didn't want to be with them and they didn't want to keep her, Miss Honey became her new guardian, and they lived happily after.<BR>I liked this book because it had unnatural things, such as having the power to move objects. I liked the idea that Matilda became interested in books and taught herslef to read around 2 or 3. It was interesting how she was such an intelligent child with not so intelligent parents. Even though she had parents that didn't love her and didn't give attention to her, she had an intelligent mind and a sweet heart. I think that's what made me love this book most of all. <BR>\\"'Your daughter is a cheat and a liar,' the father said, taking his plate of fish and placing it on his knees.\\" I was surprised by the way Matilda's father spoke about his own daughter. He was cold-hearted and said it as if her didn't know her. What amazed me most was that even with parents that just watched TV all day, she was a genius. <BR>\\"The Trunchbull, this mighty female giant, stood there in her green breeches, quivering like a blancmange.\\" I believe that this chapter had the most humor, because there was much about Miss Trunchbull's fears, and how she reacted towards it. It was funny how she thought a small, harmless newt was a snake or a crocodlie. With her strength, I was surprised that she wouldnt be able to take a snake, or even a newt.<BR>My favorite part of the book was when Matilda lifted the chalk with her eyes and started to write on the wall. She wrote to Miss Trunchbull pretending to be a ghost. Miss Trunchbull, standing in the classroom, watching a floating chalk writing about what she had done wrong years ago made her turn white. Soon enough, Miss Trunchbull was on the floor and unconcious. The next day, everything was returned to the rightful owner and she was nowhere to be seen. It was my favorite part, because Miss Trunchbull got what she deserved after all these years of torturing children and others, especially Miss Honey.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I have just begun to really appreciate the voice and music of Sarah McLachlan.  Mirrorball is the 2nd CD I've purchased, and while I am not usually a fan of live albums, I can't get enough of this one.<br />Her voice has a quality that I believe is rarely found in this day. I was only familiar with a few of the songs, but I love and now know the words to every song!  I don't use the skip buttons on this one!  And it is one of only two CD's that must be in my car when I am!<br />If you don't have this album and have never heard a live performance by Sarah McLachlan, Mirrorball really needs to be in your collection!  You will love it!
B00004RFFS|4.0|I'm not at Anne Rice fan and I've never read any of her books. I am however of fan of this movie and enjoyed it a lot.<br />Interview with the Vampire is not a horror movie. It is anything but it. The movie tells us the story of Louis.(Brad Pitt) He's over 200 years old and he's telling his life story to a reporter played by Christian Slater. He's tells us how he became a Vampire from the bite of Lestat(Cruise) and how he hates being what he is. You see the child they have played by Kirsten Dunst. He tells about his good times and his low times. It's a tragic story.<br />Brad Pitt is great as Louis. You can argue this as the best performance that he as ever made. He holds his own with Tom Cruise. It's a believable performance. You actually think he is the Vampire and he plays the emotions well.<br />Tom Cruise is simply fantastic. Lestat is a very arrogant character and Tom plays it to perfection. He shows lots of energy and the role is very well acted. Like Pitt he becomes the character and he's no longer Tom Cruise. It's a shame to see &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; and watch Stuart Townsend play a horrible Lestat.<br />Kirsten Dunst is great. She's so creepy and scary in the movie. I heard an interview with her a couple of months ago, in which she was mad that she hated the scene in the movie where she gets to kiss Pitt. It's a memorable performance and it's her humble beginning.<br />I liked Interview with the Vampire. It and &quot;Bram Stokers&quot; are in my opinion the two best vampire movies ever made.
0441172717|5.0|I read this book because it had on its cover, sci fi's supreme masterpiece. I however am a really harsh critics of both books and movies, so i had to read it to prove to myself that it wasn't.  I hate sci fi, but this book had me up all night.  The good thing was, it didn't seem sci fi, which has its robots, talking computers, light travel, and vulcan grips.  it seemed more like an action/intrigue filled history book.  the author makes the reader believe that even the most absurd notions are historical fact.  If you like history, and some action, read this book, i look forward to reading the rest of the series.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|A must get!!! probably the best music DVD out there
0805062971|3.0|Fight club the book is not equal to fight club the movie.  The book is decent in and of itself, but on screen is when the characters brought to life (maybe my imagination just sucks), even the script for the movie, which was changed a bit from the book, was better than the book.  Chuck does gets props for originating this strange, dark story,<BR>but if you've seen the movie<BR>skip the book<BR>if you haven't seen the movie, then you might want to read the book, then watch the movie, for a better appreciation of the movie.
6305696071|5.0|This movie was so excellent and funny at the same time.The fact that Richard acted so calm while Julia Roberts was just as funny and naive about the life of the rich people. This is one movie that I watch over and over again, even on the cable channel. It is Cinderella kinda story but damn Cinderella in this move, Julia Roberts, was and still beautiful; Richard Gere on the other hand is handsome and acted the role very good. I recommend this movie anytime,anyday
B0001CCXY8|2.0|Alright Cannibal Corpse will get my respect in this aspect. They are cool guys and good with their fans (I met them once), they have been around and survived a long time, and their guitar playing skills are pretty solid. <BR>  Now, onto the bad things about Cannibal Corpse.<BR>    The lyrics and the genre that they choose to play are simply over done. I know that this is their image, and what they are known for, but they really need to start coming up with some more imaginative lyrical content. How long can you have career based on mutilation, blood, guts, gore, and the like? How many times can you repeat yourselves over and over and over again? I mean, sure, you made your rep and living based on this stuff, but since you have already pretty much secured your hold in the brutal death metal genre, isn't it time to at LEAST try to write about something...ELSE? I mean the music can stay the same, fast, crushing, and a complete ear onslaught, but how about some different lyrical content for a change?<BR> As I mentioned above, the guitars in Cannibal Corpse are good, very technical, fast, and clear sounding compaired to other brutal death metal bands. Other then this however, the rest of the music is just flat, boring, and repeats itself. The vocals are just really bad, and to me, sound like a more extreme version of Johnathon Davis from Korn, a bunch of incoherent and silly belches, burps, and vomit reflex sounds. You can forget about understanding the lyrics, though sometimes I can discern them when &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; uses his raspy scream. <BR>  The double blast beats as in all brutal death metal, are annoying, and just do not sound right to the music. Playing drums so fast to me makes it sound like they are way off with the rest of the music. The bass is pretty much drowned out with the rest of the instruments, and is hard to hear to me.<BR>  As I mentioned earlier, the lyrics are old and tiring. How much more &quot;shock&quot; lyrics can Corpse recycle anyway? I always get a good chuckle when I read them, but ah well. <BR>  I am not saying Corpse is untalented and sucks, all I am saying is that in a genre of metal that is uses the same crap over and over and over again, it would be nice for the pioneers of this scene, IE, Corpse, Morbid Angel, Deicide, etc, should try to show off their great skills with some fresh material. <BR>  I know I will take a lot of heat from die hard Corpse fans for this review, but I am never afraid to speak my mind.
B00003CXXM|5.0|This was one movie I liked in 2002 because Matt Damon acted out the role very well and the film was just non stop action and thriller all the way. You can just tell that Matt Damon doesnt do much talking but acts out majority of the time, which I think is good. It is a great movie, see it
B00003CX97|5.0|It's hard to beat the acting in this epic film.  Alec Guiness, until then primarily known for comic roles, plays a ramrod straight British officer who has a tendency to get obsessed with matters of propriety and honor.  He's deadly serious, but his performance comes right up to the edge of absurdity, including his amazing facial and body language at the climactic, ironic final moment.  William Holden shows why he embodied the American male ideal in the 50s--the carefree, scheming existentialist who decides to care at the last, tragic moment.  Sessue Hayakawa and Jack Hawkins are also memorable.  This movie is one of my favorites.  It unfolds slowly, but with a strong line of tension throughout that keeps you utterly hypnotized.  The movie is almost the proto-typical blockbuster--fabulous photography, great scenery, powerful music, casts of thousands, and of course, that great big bridge that they actually built for the movie, and that, in the end, they...(I won't spoil it.)  Rare is the movie that manages to have a compelling anti-war message while paying full tribute to the bravery of soldiers and the justice of war.
0805062971|5.0|I'm kind of disappointed most of the reviews here are written by guys, so I'd like to express my opinion. This book ROCKS. I have to admit I saw the movie first, which I loved, and I just finished reading the book, which I love even more, for the 3rd time. Funny in a disturbing kind of way, this book is a witty, perceptive satire on today's society. The story is so dynamic with so many funny observations, it's easy to read in one go and hard to put down. Definitely 9.5/10.<br />If you liked Fight Club and want to read another Palahniuk book, I recommend Survivor, which is kind of written in the same style and is also extremely entertaining.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Bill, please get back to doing movies like Stripes!  I have no clue what the academy saw in this movie (they must be 60+ in age).. If this movie was on in the Dentist office I would recommend the Musak machine instead.
B000002G7E|5.0|White Light/White Heat is the followup to Velvet Underground's now classic debut album with Nico. Whereas their debut mixed psychedelia, pretty melodies, and noisy rock, White Light/White Heat took the loud arrangements of &quot;European Son&quot; and &quot;Run Run Run&quot; and spread it across an entire album. In retrospect, this album today sounds like the beginning of what became grunge music. Although Neil Young has been called the Godfather of Grunge, one may think differently upon listening to this album which was released 16 months before Young started performing the noisier songs he'd debut on Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere.<br />Like their debut, the band's innovation is in full bloom here. The title track is great garage rock with a riveting piano in the background, something you rarely hear now, let alone in 1968. &quot;I Heard Her Call My Name&quot; is even more intense, featuring wild vocals from Lou Reed and great solos with plenty of feedback. &quot;Lady Godiva's Operation&quot; is the most melodic of the loud tracks, one of the few songs where the occassional out of tune vocals add to the song rather than ruin it. &quot;The Gift&quot;, narrated by John Cale, is a warped love tale of a man wrapping himself as a present which ultimately leads to tragedy over a repetitive three-chord riff. You're so into the lyrics here that you forget it's an 8-minute track. &quot;Here She Comes Now&quot; is the only track that recalls the mellower tracks of their debut. Finally, there's &quot;Sister Ray&quot;, which between Reed's improvising vocals, Sterling Morrison's noisy soloing, Maureen Tucker's relentless drumming, and Cale's carnival-like organ is 17 minutes of ecstasy. After this album, Cale would leave the band and their subsequent albums were more a showcase for Reed's songwriting skills. First and foremost, this is a very different album from their diverse debut and the quiet songs from their next self-titled album. If you want to hear the roots of grunge and punk, you have to check this out.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|Definately a throwback to Awake!  IMO, their best album.  (and one of the best rock/metal albums ever recorded, for that matter).  Haven't really been into the CD's between TOT and ACOS (although I own them all and appreciate them for what they are - good progressive rock albums) But this time, they've got that intensity back that made me such a huge fan in the first place.<br />Rudess is great, but I still REALLY miss Kevin Moore's influence on the band.<br />All in all a great disc, my only complaint is that LaBrie needs to learn how to scream ala InFlames, Killswitch Engage, etc.  But then again, I guess he wouldnt be James LaBrie then, would he?:) <br />I really hope they continue in this direction.
B00000K19E|4.0|The first and the best of the trio of the Matrix movies.  The Wachowski brothers spin a tale of a man, Neo, played Keanu Reeves, who is awakened from the dream that he has been living his entire life.  He learns that his life has merely been part of a computer-generated matrix, a 'reality' created by machines for all of humanity in their version of a final solution.  The humans dream their lives away while the machines siphon off their biological energy to power their world.<br />As the &quot;Chosen One,&quot; Reeves is trained for the purpose of defeating the machines by destroying their matrix--the computer programs that keep humanity enslaved.  <br />The movie borrows elements from Tron and injects philosophical and martial arts aspects.  Many of the special effects are outstanding, as are the physical combat scenes between the heroic humans and the sadistic agents (computer programs that serve as assassins).  While some of story goes unexplained--such as how Morpheus knew Neo was the &quot;Chosen One,&quot; and how they manage to continually tap into the matrix with no opposition--it is still wonderful storytelling.  The end of the movie is, actually, only the beginning of the story.<br />Excellent sci-fi entertainment.  It's a shame the sequels weren't as good.
B000002UXZ|5.0|These six tracks are better than all his other stuff. This is the stuff that dreams are made of. Take a listen, or better yet own the album. Listen to that guitar howl.
B00003CXA2|5.0|I wish the movie had never ended. Truly an Oscar winner. The people who don't like this movie don't know what they're talking about. I wish they made a 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, and al the way to google. If you buy this movie you will ner regret it.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|Okay, hang on--this isn't a TOT review. I already wrote one and I'm not going to do it again. This CD hasn't gotten any better in my opinion since then, though, so my advice would still be--don't waste your money on this.<br />However, if you didn't like TOT but still like the heavier side of DT (back when they still wrote good music, I mean--think Awake, not 6° or TOT), or if you *do* like TOT, I would heartily recommend trying Pagan's Mind's \\"Celestial Entrance\\". These guys are just amazing. Just give them a try, you won't be disappointed. Just be aware if you're more into the softer side of DT--these guys are definitely prog *metal* (ie think \\"Pull Me Under\\" and \\"Take the Time\\" more than \\"Surrounded\\", although there are softer numbers on the CD, too).<br />As for the line-up, they're pretty well-balanced, and very proficient, too. Two guitars for a \\"fuller\\" sound (much less twiddling, but this gives their keyboard player the opportunity to play keys instead of trying to emulate a second guitar), a singer who sounds like a dead ringer for Geoff Tate at times (although these guys sure aren't copycats), and, guess what--a real bass player who actually *plays* on every song, not just a name in the credits. And boy, does it show in their overall sound! Maybe DT should try this, some day...<br />I won't even try to compare both albums, as you would think me biased. Don't think I am, though. (Heck, I didn't even know Pagan's Mind until last week, and I won't say anything about their first CD, as I haven't listened to it yet. And I sure don't get a cut on the sales!) But then, to each his own. Let's just say that Celestial Entrance is definitely \\"er\\" than TOT, IMHO--ie harder, better, \\"proggier\\"... heck, it's even longer!<br />Oh, and the real surprise is that Pagan's Mind aren't even Swedes or Finns. Nope, they just come from... Norway. *smile*<br />Anyway, whether you liked TOT or not, if you're into prog, just check these guys--you won't be disappointed.  :)<br />Addendum: If you like softer prog, you shouldn't miss \\"A Twist of Fate\\" by John Arch. Never was much of a fan of the stuff he did with Fates (don't ask me why), but this EP is pretty good. Very short, though (28 minutes only). And if you don't know which one to get between this one and Celestial Entrance, my advice would be--grab both for a change of pace!

B000000OQ5|5.0|I agree with R. Gorham's review.  This is one of the first albums I ever purchased (yes, I'm talking vinyl here because I didn't have a cassette player until 1987).  At that time in my life (as well as now I suppose) I was looking for a fresh sound in the music that I chose to listen to.  Tesla was definitely representative of that sound.  They had everything that I loved in a band.  Namely: guitars, unique vocals, decent lyrics, and a totally different package than what was out there at the time.  I was bored with hair bands like Motley Crue, and the other bands that were more circa 1984, and looking for something new.  <br />I personally schlepped this record to parties all over Central Pennsylvania before Tesla ever got a hit on MTV.  I have the scratches on the album (from some idiot dropping it in a gravel driveway) to prove it.  I'm sure that I was one of their original east-coast fans.  Every single song reminds me of a place in my life or something in particular and I'm transported to this day.  It's music I can plug in now, almost 20 years later, and it's still relevant for me.   Love these guys!  And I never cared how they looked from day one...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I live overseas, and for once that turned out to be a good thing, American-television-wise, because I got to see Firefly on DVD, widescreen format, episodes in the correct order (and no commercials, needless to say). I already gave it five stars, so I won't bother repeating all the accolades in the vast majority of reviews below. I'll just say it's better than any iteration of Star Trek, and even in some ways better than Babylon 5 and FarScape--and I'm a die-hard, true-blue fan of both those shows.<P>I do think, to enjoy it, you may have to overcome any anti-Western prejudice you might have. (That's Western as in cowboy shows, not Western as in hemisphere.) Thing is, all that cowboy stuff is not as unlikely as it might seem. As explained in the first episode, the Alliance's colonization policy involves dropping people on marginal worlds with some supplies and then leaving them to survive--or not. In situations like that, a lot of technology will be lost or too precious to use except in emergencies.<P>One reviewer below dismissed Firefly as right-wing paranoia. That's funny, because I've read other people dismissing it as left-wing propoganda. It seems that those few who choose to view it through a political lens interpret it to fit their own politics and tastes: of people who like the show, right-wingers seem to think Mal is George W and the Alliance is the Liberal Elite; left-wingers think the crew of Serenity are the dispossessed Liberals cheated of their victory and scrabbling to survive while the Alliance's Neocon Nightmare erases their civil rights. And vice-versa for those who hate the show. It's so easy to view it either way that it should be obvious neither of these weird views is on the creators' agenda. They're interested in making a good story.<P>Remember: Firefly's Civil War is not America's Civil War--it was fought for very different reasons in very different circumstances, most of which were never made clear because the network didn't allow the seriesto survive long enough. While little good has been said about the Alliance so far, I doubt very much that Joss Whedon was planning to leave it so black &amp; white--and there have already been hints that the rebels were not perfect. And definitions of liberal and conservative change in different cultures and different times. (Example: Japan's very conservative ruling party is a strong supporter of publicly-funded health care.) Exploring Firefly's politics is interesting, but trying to make it into a perfect reflection of our world is foolish.<P>And for anyone who hesitates to buy these because the series is unfinished, fear not: The movie is coming, and there are already hints that a new TV series will continue the story after that.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast is one of the best animated films of all time, and it shows with this exceptional dvd.  <br />At the heart of this 2-Disc edition dvd is the remastered audio and video.  Never before have I seen such amazing restoration, showcasing the groundbreaking animation that Disney is known for.  The sound is equally impressive, and the addition of surround sound is great.  The extra features are plentiful, with three versions of the film, audio commentary, games for the children, music videos, and more.  What more could you want in a dvd?<br />So I recommend that you go out and get this dvd.  Beauty and the Beast is one of the greatest animated films you will ever see, with a classic story, wonderful animation, characters, and music.  You'll have plenty of laughs, and kids and adults alike will enjoy every second of it. Not to mention that the Special Platinum Edition has more features and extras than you could possibly ask for.  This is a must-have for any home.
B0001CCXGG|5.0|I went to the glenside PA show and thought the DVD was better (probably because they were being filmed and wanted to make a good showing). I liked Joe's set the best, his riffs and melodies just seem a notch above Vai, and far superior to Yngwie. Vai is still quite good though. Yngwie could be so much better if he could just take it out of warp drive once in a while to tease the audience (for what is coming). I liken his playing to a flat out drum solo without peaks and valleys - it gets boring quick.<br />The dvd also has some nice close-ups of the fret work. I felt it was worth the price.
B000069AUI|5.0|It is rare to find a body of music that one can listen to from first to last without having the need to skip through songs at least once.  This is that CD. There are a few songs like &quot;The Scientist&quot; &quot;Clocks&quot; and &quot;Warning Sign&quot; that standout just a little more for me.  Coldplay also has a track called &quot;Whisper&quot; that is somehow reminicient of Sting's signature sound. The album is truly mesmorizing.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Of course, you get all the people that say something along the lines of, 'I am a HUGE Dylan fan, but this album is just sooooo terrible'. <br />Well, no one really can expound certain opinions that don't matter on more than an individual level. If something is universally accepted as trash, more than likely it is close. Dylan has some albums that don't appeal to people, and he has albums that were truthfully rushed to point where, even when the album was not bad, it could have been much better in terms of artistic vision and coherence. I am not one to review or gauge things on the stupid, primitive level so many of you find appealing; that which is the trashing of someone's carefully attended work, much like this very album. That being said, Love and Theft is a loose classic. In my mind and in many others. Dylan and this producer are a team for the ages. <br />One reason I find that many people are not hearing this album right is the general acoustic degeneration of their own equipment. L&amp;T is easily one of the best sounding albums produced in this digital age. That is pure fact. Not even debatable. Most will never hear this on an audiophile's system. Sucks to you; you are missing out. <br />Anyway, I generally have been impressed with Dylan's lyrics and voice in his older ages. He does have the ability to produce general tripe when bumbling through things too fast. In all of his writing this is most apparent in the 80's when, for whatever reasons, he was doing his own thing. But if this is to be called bad writing, or even bad muscianship, than no one will ever write something that can be called 'high art'. Not even our most literate poets of page. Dylan's voice can only be seen as the relic of a past time. A precious antique that greatly extends the experience of this palette. How can some of you be so negative when your experience is so nil? The man is old and he is still producing things most musicians only dream of. His voice is in fine form here. What do you want: Highway 61 reiterated for the billionth term? How caustic and inane! <br />So.............. beyond all the criticism, and in light of all the negative things ever posted about this artist--mostly from critics barely of age to even raise their hand to this man--here is to the ages, sir: a drink to your journey through the incorrigible masses who wouldn't appreciate what they could never ever accomplish themselves; a true batch of songs from the heart.
B000096IBI|5.0|Until I saw \\"Modern Times\\" I only knew Chaplin from clips and impressions rather than from his films.  I didn't see the talent.  I understood that he parlayed his popularity into power and control over his work and that he made a huge contribution to American cinema.  But I found Chaplin the performer, cloying and sentimental.<br />After watching \\"Modern Times\\" however, I understand why he is one of the great performing talents of the 20th century.  The film is nearly silent and mostly a series of comedic set-pieces, each one a virtuoso display of Chaplin's boundless talent.<br />What struck me most in watching Chaplin was both his ability to come up with a routine; strapped to an eating machine, skating blindfolded in a department store and amusing hardened diners as a dancing waiter and executing the concept with grace, humanity and humor.  It is also a great testament to his acting that we never question Chaplin's \\"little tramp\\" an average, slightly ludicrous character who has amazing talent that deeply undercuts his character's supposed mediocrity.<br />My other surprise was how effective and nuanced the satire is in \\"Modern Times.\\"  Chaplin's little tramp is the perfect protagonist in a story about the perils of automation and technology.  The little tramp is never defeated and always optimistic.  He is like a cartoon character in that each travail is new and he doesn't carry with him the baggage from the previous experience.  But he is also terribly human; frail, self absorbed, eccentric and resilient so that we the audience don't feel the oppressive weight that automation and technology has upon the working person.  Without a strong, human protagonist, the attack against modern society could seem more global and distancing.  Instead we witness the pain from an individual perspective that connects to our own lives.

B0000C7PRY|2.0|I have always loved Spock's Beard, I love Transatlantic, and &quot;Snow&quot; is truly a remarkable achievement in music.  However, as much as I realize that Spock's Beard was really Neal Morse, I just couldn't get into this Jesus-has-saved-me album. <br />Musically, the album is fine.  Lyrically, a real turn off.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|will not recommend. Husband and I fell asleep twice watching. don't get the whole Oscar buss. still love Bill Murray!
B000002UAI|4.0|this is not by any means the beatles' best album, nor is it their second best.  for some, it is their worst.  no matter what - it's still better than a lot of band's best efforts.  this album was cranked out merely four months after Hard Day's Night, and the fab four's exhaustion and frustration at the whirlwind that was Beatlemania shows throughout this album.  the first three songs - No Reply, I'm A Loser, and Baby's In Black, are three of Lennon's darkest songs.  this, in my opinion, is where the beatles really began to turn from the masters of pop to the brilliant band of Revolver, Sgt Peppers, and the white album.  the three songs mentioned above, along with mccartney's I'll Follow the Sun, are shades of things to come, while Rock and Roll Music, and Kansas City are the remnants of their roots, that they would later shed completely on the amazing one-two punch of Rubber Soul and Revolver.  as a single album, this is a weaker effort than most - but viewed within the scope of their entire career and evolution - this album is not to be overlooked
B00000K2W1|2.0|If you really want to get a taste of Janis, feel her soul and passion, don't start here.  This CD reflects Janis's music about as much as &quot;Skeletons from the Closet&quot; reflects the Grateful Dead's music.  Do yourself a favor and start with &quot;Pearl&quot; or &quot;Dem' ol' Kozmic Blues.&quot;  I won't go as far as to say that this CD is no good, but your money is better spent somewhere else.
B00012QM86|5.0|this was a very interesting movie, It really showed me things that i couldn't believe. How could other human beings do this. It makes me wonder how could we let something like this happen. this movie made me cry, I also got so angry at the Germen people, i can't believe some people living in Germeny let is thing happen, and what were the jewish people thinking they had time to do something too. There was enough of them to fight back.<BR>anyway this was a great movie. I enjoyed a lot...
0385504209|5.0|Simply put, if you were not to read The Da Vinci Code, you have no idea what you are missing. The way Dan Brown blends fact with fiction so brilliantly keeps the reader turning the pages and wanting to know what happens next. The reader is constantly thrown off center when he or she realizes that the way things appear never really is what it seems to be. The action, the betrayal, the sheer drama keeps the reader begging for more with every chapter. The way Dan Brown suddenly makes obviously clear the riddles that seem impossible at first glance force the reader to look at every riddle with a keen eye in order to look beyond what initially seems to be is absolutely ingenious. If you have not yet read this book, you must read it as soon as possible. Dan Brown has done more than just hit a home run with this novel. Fact and fiction come together masterfully in this marvel of a novel. Go out and buy The Da Vinci Code today!
0312319517|5.0|The premise of the story is a little extraordinary - among the thousands who died in the chaos that followed the breakdown of the Yugoslavia was an idealistic American young man who had volunteered to provide humanitarian assistance in the conflict zone.  I used the adjective extraordinary because this young man was unusual among the victims, even among the relief volunteers, in that he came from a very, very wealthy family, which could unlike most families of other victims, could afford move heaven and earth to discover the truth of his death, and hire the Avenger bring the perpetrator to justice.<br />Unlike other thrillers which focussed on only a main characters, the author dealt fairly evenly with the cast of Avenger.  In Part One of the book, chapter titles such as the The Hard Hat, The Victim and The Magnate provided detailed backgrounds of the the Avenger, the victim and his wealthy grandfather who was a World War 2 veteran.  These main characters were further developed in subsequent chapters, while supporting cast such as the investigator hired to find out what happened to the victim merited their own chapters such as The Tracker.  The culprit who became the object of the hunt also got his own chapter in The Killer.<br />The author made clever use of compartmentalisation to weave different threads to represent different stages of development from different perspectives.  Besides introducing the major characters, chapters in Part One also helped to set the stage to explain why despite their wealth and influence, the family of the victim could not get the legal authorities to apprehend the culprit and had to turn to hiring a bounty hunter.  It also had a glimpse into the consideration of taking the law into one's own hands, the difference between killing the culprit and bringing the culprit to face legal actions.  I thought the author had written too short a section here and the subject offered more potential for scope.<br />One thing the author had done wellwas to avoid repetitive scenes in introducing the characters.  It would have been too much of a bore to see different characters go through similar rites of passage to become the kind of people they were at the onset of the story - priviliged/underpriviliged childhood, distinguished service in the military before making good on their own merit.  Here, the author managed to brew a different flavour for each individual.  Unfortunately, these rich background materials were almost lost in the later parts of the book, except for the Avenger's.  Sharp-minded readers could recognise characteristics and tools-of-trades from the Avenger's background being utilised in bringing the culprit to justice.<br />The end of Part One introduced a twist to the development - the hunt for the culprit would be hampered by the fact that the culprit might be being protected by some government agency.<br />Fewer major characters were introduced in Part Two, which detailed how the culprit was finally tracked down, and which government agency was protecting the culprit.  Characterisation slowly gave way to plot development.  Readers are introduced to the issue of &quot;setting a thief to catch a thief&quot;.  While this is a familiar old theme, the author painted a bleak picture of what it actually means to have to make deals with ruthless criminals in order to go after targets they consider more dangerous.  By now, the cast of characters had grown considerably, but the skillful characterisation means that readers are in little danger of losing track of the names.<br />The last Part of the book deals with the build up to the climax of when the Avenger would finally confront the criminal.  Here, readers see the Avenger being hunted down in a manner akin to the assassin in the author's early book, Day of the Jackal.  The Avenger had not only to go through false identities, but also lay false trails and avoid traps by authorities.  The manner in which the Avenger penetrated the heavy wall of protection surrounding the culprit is highly original which would become a classic.  I saw some reviewers commenting he had too much luck on his side.  My own careful reading indicated that luck had nothing to do with it, the Avenger was a survivor of Nam, and was a Tunnel Rat.  He was also a student of history.  He had to outthink worse opponents, and the so-called luck was actually advanced planning.  Luck was Luke Skywalker walking into Jabba's den and had Jabba decide to bring him and his friends out of the den to the Pit of Sarlaac.  Knowing where your opponent would run to and to wait for him is not luck.<br />In no part of the book did the Avenger depend on his superior firepower, martial prowess, personal charm or gadgets or some invicibility that plagued characters such as James Bond.  This is indeed another masterpiece from the author.

B00007KWHN|5.0|While it wouldn't be until later in the year with their fourth album FRAGILE that Yes would achieve widespread popularity in the U.S., the group's third release THE YES ALBUM is vintage Yes.  After their first two albums sold poorly, founding member Peter Banks is replaced by guitarist Steve Howe and the first classic lineup of the band is now in place.<br />THE YES ALBUM includes standout tracks &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace,&quot; &quot;Starship Trooper,&quot; &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Change.&quot; The album was the band's first Top 10 hit in the U.K. and their first Top 40 LP in the U.S. It also gave Yes their first Top 40 single when &quot;Your Move&quot; reached No. 40 in December of 1971. [The single version is included as one of the bonus tracks.]<br />The other two bonus tracks are the single edit of &quot;Starship Trooper: Life Seeker&quot; and a studio version of Seve Howe's solo &quot;Clap.&quot; The latter, at four minutes, is longer than the original live version by about a minute and is a fine showpiece for Howe's acoustic guitar playing. [Running time: 52:10]VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
B00005JM02|5.0|Once again, Pixar and Disney have joined forces to release a fun animated movie with a warm-hearted ending. The computer animated graphics and the story are just as touching as any other Pixar/Disney film. Finding Nemo is the story of two clownfish: Marlin(Albert Brooks)and his son Nemo. After his wife and all of his other children are devoured, Marlin becomes a nervous, overprotective father who fears the ocean and prefers to hide out in his sea anemone. On the first day of school, the day that Marlin finally lets go of his son (temporarily), Nemo is captured by an Australian scuba-diver/dentist. Marlin desperately searches for his son and is soon accompanied by a blue tang fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) who suffers from short-term memory. They face many dangers to find Nemo who meanwhile, is in danger himself. The dentist is going to present his frightening niece, Darla, with Nemo. Big trouble. Boosted by the witty humor of Ellen DeGeneres, the awe-inspiring visual effects, and the moving storyline, this is a movie the whole family will love.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The movie hasn't come out in Japanese theaters just yet, but I watch the DVD that I ordered from Amazon the other day.  I have to say that I loved it very much. There were some scenes that were a little bit too stereotypical. I am sure that some Japanese may take those very offensive. But, somehow I felt love for Japan in this movie. Sofia Coppola lived in Japan in the past, so she must know what she was making too.  Besides, just because it is taking place in Japan, it isn't about that.  It is about feeling isolated and alinated, isn't it?  A big city like Tokyo can easily make you feel like that.  And that feeling is universal. I really felt for those characters.  I felt like I knew how they were feeling. I thought Bob Harris is a kind of like Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver in New York only he didn't go as nuts.   Sofia Coppola did a great job putting those feeling out on the screen.  I really admire that.  Those who watched this movie and wonderd how it is like to be in Tokyo, try to come and visit here.  You may see what Sofia was trying to come across.
B0001AP12G|4.0|By producing hit songs for artists such as Twista, Alicia Keys, and most notably Jay-Z, Kanye West has established quite a buzz around himself.  He has even enticed the people who jock G-Unit's boring music to listen to this positive album.<br />Intro - The album starts off with a funny intro from Kanye's friend Deray who sounds very similiar to Bernie Mac.<br />We Don't Care - The beat and the chorus are addictive.  Kanye's subject matter on this track is uplifting for black people.  This is the kind of stuff kids should listen to instead of G-Unit.<br />Graduation Day - Another funny skit<br />All Falls Down - A great track featuring Syleena Johnson on the chorus.  On this track Kanye talks about people who are self-conscious.  I can feel Kanye on this song where he talks about how we blacks buy lots of clothes at high prices that we don't really need and that's one of the reasons why we end up broke so often.<br />I'll Fly Away - Pointless<br />Spaceship - Addictive track featuring GLC and Consequence.  This is one of the songs on the album I can see myself still listening to 6 months from now.<br />Jesus Walks - This track has some of Kanye's best subject matter on the whole album.  Very few mcs are willing to rap about Jesus on a song and plus Kanye plans to make this track his 3rd single and video.<br />Never Let Me Down - This is my 2nd favorite song on the entire album.  The production is great.  Jay-Z starts the track off with a fiery verse and then Kanye gets more introspective on his.  This is quite possibly the best verse Kanye has ever wrote.  J. Ivy delivers spoken word and then Jay-Z adds a freestyle to the end of the song as a bonus for those who bought the REAL album and not the internet nerds who downloaded it.<br />Get 'Em High - This track features one of my favorite mcs Common.  Kanye carries on a conversation with a girl through his verse and Kweli spits over the phone.  Common's verse is the real gem here though.  Newjacks should pay close attention to this verse.<br />Workout Plan - weak skit<br />New Workout Plan - This song was okay when I first heard it but now the beat annoys me a lot.  Kanye has a good theme about goldiggers on this song but I find myself skipping this song lately.<br />Slow Jams - A great single.  You've all heard it by now.<br />Breathe in Breathe Out - This is the other weak song on the album.  It would have been much better if Ludacris would have had a verse.<br />School Spirit (skit) - zzzz<br />School Spirit - This song is okay but nothing special<br />Lil' Jimmy Skit - Kanye seems to have a lot of hatred for college.  You'll see while listening to this skit.<br />Two Words - Another of my favorite songs on the disc.  Even though I heard this song over a year ago, it's still fresh to me and Mos Def's verse is pure fire.  While Kanye's is decent and Freeway's is too short.  Miri Ben Ari does a good job on the violins at the end of this track too.<br />Through the Wire - We've all heard it now, good track.<br />Family Business - Kanye talks about his family life.  I'm feeling this one.<br />Last Call - This song has the best beat on the entire cd.  Kanye spits 2 short verses and then proceeds to explain how he got his deal on Rocafella.<br />Overall this is a pretty good album.  From some of the reviews I've read around here though it seems that you people throw around the word &quot;classic&quot; way too much.  The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of Kanye's flow.  Kanye's lyrics are pretty clever and he has great subject matter but the problem is the way he delivers it.  Sometimes his rhymes come out corny and blunt.  The other thing is that this album doesn't seem to have the longevity of a classic LP.  I listened to it for about 3 weeks straight after I bought it but now I find myself hardly putting it in my stereo.  It's a breath of fresh air to hip-hop as whole (only nerds constantly compare mainstream/underground).  But it is by no means a classic.

B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is an awesome CD! If you are a fan of Pink Floyd, this CD is a must-have! If you are a first time listener, this is the CD to get. This CD is great to listen to at all times. It is one of those CD's that always fits the mood, no matter what time it is or how you are feeling. Their music is truly amazing on this CD. This CD is especially great when it is played with the Wizard of Oz (look into Dark Side of Oz for details)!!!
B000001FZK|5.0|Everyone knows Astral Weeks. And Eno's recording Another Green World regularly features on 'greatest albums ever' lists. Also Loveless is recognised as a classic. But Laughing Stock remains unknown, not so much under-rated as unrated, even though it's up there with these other masterpieces. Similarities -<BR> *) it is a trip - the songs gel together to form a mood-piece that transports the listener.<BR> *) the inspired musicians follow their own muse rather than sticking to the customary rock forms.<BR> *) it succeeds wonderfully.
B000060P79|2.0|Just balls in what?  A vice?  The &quot;Perfect&quot; song comes out of my speakers, and I remember why XM or MP3 mixes are vital to my listening experience...I can shut all the crap out and listen to what I want.  So I will avoid making personal attacks on this band.  They have an audience...they fill a need.  They may suck in my eyes (and many others) but I know a lot of people who find the Beatles archaic and Hendrix unexciting.  I don't agree, but that's their, um, interesting opinion.  I hate MTV now anyway (and have for about seven years), so as long as bands like Simple Plan get  their videos played on TRL and at 4:00 in the morning or spun on the local &quot;music mix&quot; radio stations, I will hear very little of them anyway.  If you like these kids, buy the album and help them through college in a few years when the novelty has worn thinner than the tepid lyrics and whiny voice on these songs.
0380715430|4.0|When Bill Bryson doesn't have anything else to do (yeah, right), he might want to consider issuing a revised edition of this entertaining but somewhat dated book.  As he so ably points out, language is protean and much has changed in the last 15 years since he worked on this.  In addition to new research and revelations that might correct or amend the text, there is the incomparable affect of the internet that has arisen since this book saw the light, not to mention the \\"business speak\\" that corporate culture has been slipping in of late.<br />That said, there is much to be gained by reading this book.  Bryson's wonder and delight in the English language is contagious.  While some of the historical information may be familiar at first, especially if you, like him, have read McCrum's THE STORY OF ENGLISH, his sorting out of the origins of our language and historical forces is quite lucid and thorough refresher course.  What I especially appreciated was his look at how American and English usage and pronunciation diverged.  I did not realize that the plummy \\"ah\\" sound that Americans identify so strongly with the British accent, as in glahss and cahn't, only came about in the 18th century, a social fashion that survived.  I've come away with a better understanding of the role of how geographic movement and isolation affects language, as well as the very human need to name everything in site.<br />A note to recently indoctrinated Bryson fans: this was written rather early in his book career, in his English mode.  Keep in mind that he only got better and funnier, though there is a sharp intelligence, graceful voice and sly wit behind every sentence of this book.
0385504209|4.0|I liked this novel because it's a book that you just won't want to put down. It's got everything from suspense to murder. The book starts out a little slow but towards the middle of the novel is when the book gets better. This book takes place in England and France. Some of the main characters include Robert Langdon, Sophi Neveu, and Fache. What I don't really like about the book is that the author jumps around from chapter to chapter. I found it to be distracting. My brother-in-law read this book and recommended this book to me. Despite the book starting off slowly, I would recommend it to anyone. I am not a big novel reader but if you like a murder mystery then you will like this book.The DaVinci Code is a page turner.
B00009ATIX|5.0|Solaris\\" tells the story of a planet that reads minds, and obliges its visitors by devising and providing people they have lost, and miss. The Catch-22 is that the planet knows no more than its visitors know about these absent people. As the film opens, two astronauts have died in a space station circling the planet, and the survivors have sent back alarming messages. A psychiatrist named Chris Kelvin (George Clooney) is sent to the station, and when he awakens after his first night on board, his wife, Rheya (Natascha McElhone), is in bed with him. Some time earlier on earth, she had committed suicide.<br />\\"She's not human,\\" Kelvin is warned by Dr. Helen Gordon (Viola Davis), one of the surviving crew members. Kelvin knows this materialization cannot be his wife, yet is confronted with a person who seems palpably real, shares memories with him and is flesh and blood. The other survivor, the goofy Snow (Jeremy Davies), asks, \\"I wonder if they can get pregnant?\\"<br />This story originated with a Polish novel by Stanislaw Lem that is considered one of the major adornments of science fiction. It was made into a 1972 movie of the same name by the Russian master Andrei Tarkovsky. Now Steven Soderbergh has retold it in the kind of smart film that has people arguing about it on their way out of the theater.<br />The movie needs science fiction to supply the planet and the space station, which furnish the premise and concentrate the action, but it is essentially a psychological drama. When Kelvin arrives on the space station, he finds the survivors seriously spooked. Soderbergh directs Jeremy Davies to escalate his usual style of tics and stutters, to the point where a word can hardly be uttered without his hands waving to evoke it from the air.<br />Even scarier is Gordon, the scientist played by Viola Davis, who has seen whatever catastrophe overtook the station and does not consider Kelvin part of the solution. In his gullibility will he believe his wife has somehow really been resurrected? And ... what does the planet want? Why does it do this? As a favor, or as a way of luring us into accepting manifestations of its own ego and need? Will the human race eventually be replaced by the Solaris version?<br />Clooney has successfully survived being named People magazine's sexiest man alive by deliberately choosing projects that ignore that image. His alliance with Soderbergh, both as an actor and co-producer, shows a taste for challenge. Here, as Kelvin, he is intelligent, withdrawn, sad, puzzled. Certain this seems to be his wife, and although he knows intellectually that she is not, still--to destroy her would be ... inhuman. The screenplay develops a painful paradox out of that reality. <br />The genius of Lem's underlying idea is that the duplicates, or replicants, or whatever we choose to call them, are self-conscious and seem to carry on with free will from the moment they are evoked by the planet. Rheya, for example, says, \\"I'm not the person I remember. I don't remember experiencing these things.\\" And later, \\"I'm suicidal because that's how you remember me.\\"<br />In other words, Kelvin gets back not his dead wife, but a being who incorporates all he knows about his dead wife, and nothing else, and starts over from there. She has no secrets because he did not know her secrets. If she is suicidal, it is because he thought she was. The deep irony here is that all of our relationships in the real world are exactly like that, even without the benefit of Solaris. We do not know the actual other person. What we know is the sum of everything we think we know about them. Even empathy is perhaps of no use; we think it helps us understand how other people feel, but maybe it only tells us how we would feel, if we were them.<br />At a time when many American movies pump up every fugitive emotion into a clanging assault on the audience, Soderbergh's \\"Solaris\\" is quiet and introspective. There are some shocks and surprises, but this is not \\"Alien.\\" It is a workshop for a discussion of human identity. It considers not only how we relate to others, but how we relate to our ideas of others--so that a completely phony, non-human replica of a dead wife can inspire the same feelings that the wife herself once did. That is a peculiarity of humans: We feel the same emotions for our ideas as we do for the real world, which is why we can cry while reading a book, or fall in love with movie stars. Our idea of humanity bewitches us, while humanity itself stays safely sealed away into its billions of separate containers, or \\"people.\\"<br />When I saw Tarkovsky's original film, I felt absorbed in it, as if it were a sponge. It was slow, mysterious, confusing, and I have never forgotten it. Soderbergh's version is more clean and spare, more easily readable, but it pays full attention to the ideas and doesn't compromise. Tarkovsky was a genius, but one who demanded great patience from his audience as he ponderously marched toward his goals. The Soderbergh version is like the same story freed from the weight of Tarkovsky's solemnity. And it evokes one of the rarest of movie emotions, ironic regret.
B00005Y46O|5.0|Sitting here listening to the bonus songs on this remastered cd only confirms what I knew before, having listened to the original album over the last 20 years--This is Paul Rodgers at his unequivocal best!  Though he had some distinguished moments with BadCo, nothing he has done since compares to the remarkable performances on this cd.  Here, he is the conflation of Otis and Janis, singing from the gut with a spiritual abandon unmatched in his later efforts.  After listening to this version of Paul, the later Paul, for the most part, seems stilted and contrived. <br />And let's not forget the rest of the band.  Simon is his usual solid self, hammering out the rhythm in no-nonsense, in-your-face style.  His performance on The Hunter is the epitome of bombast--He out-Bonhams Bonham.  Yet, he can also play with subtlety, an accomplishment all the more evident in Free's less-is-more method.  Andy Fraser's inventive approach to the bass elevates it to a standing of crucial import rather than simply a background instrument.  And regarding Paul Kossoff, with all due respect to Eric, Pete, Jimmy, Duane, et al, Kossoff is directly channeling God on this cd.  Few guitarists can carry a band without making you think that there needs to be a rhythm guitar in the background.  Kossoff's playing makes you glad that there isn't one because it would only intrude on his spellbinding flourishes.  Such dexterity and nuance is enough to bring tears to your eyes and make you want to holler at the same time.<br />In other words, this cd is a seminal recording in the history of rocknroll, one of the great live performances in all of its flawed glory.  The bonus tracks only confirm this claim all the more.  The only problem with the cd is that it leaves you begging for more.  <br />One note of interest though.  We are told that all of the original songs of the album are included on this cd.  My album also has a studio recording of My Brother Jake.  Perhaps there was a difference in the American and British releases.  But this omission does not detract from the depth of the cd.  Plus, My Brother Jake is available on Molten Gold, which is also well worth owning.
B00005K3OT|3.0|On one hand this movie is lush, sensual and beautiful.  I thought the director's use of color and symbolism were excellent.  Also, the actors perform beautifully and not &quot;over the top&quot; as might be expected.  On another level, I had problems with the movie's anti-Catholic stance.  I know that this is &quot;just a movie,&quot; and I'm not even Catholic, but I definitely see a movement in our society that paints Catholics, Christians, etc. as repressed and in need of &quot;deliverance,&quot; no pun intended.
B000002MQ9|5.0|I've been reading some of the comments about this album. Most of them are purely based on personal feelings and preferences. So is mine, I believe. However, at some point, I think a work of art should no longer submit to personal opinions, rather it should enter the constellation of everlasting monuments to mankind's ability to create Beauty.<BR>In fact, no matter what the opinions are, this is a monument, &quot;Within ...&quot; is a landmark in music creation. And only if the name of the band wasn't so ... dark, perhaps more visibility would be available to both Perry and Gerrard.<BR>The evolution of the compositions in this record are the perfect settlement to this collection of art; each and every title is placed exactly where it should, and no superfluous sound is recorded. You will find it very difficult to point out any kind of mistakes in this record, appart from wether you like it or not.<BR>And of course, as a band, DCD works out just close to perfection. The sublime Perry's lyrics and the supernatural Lisa's voice. It's all in there.<BR>If you ever go to Paris, dont miss a visit to Pre Lachaise cemetery. There you will find the tomb displayed on the cover. I was there but only found that afterwards!<BR>An aboslute masterpice.
B00007BH5C|4.0|As background music, this works just fine, but compared to the soundtrack for FOTR, this one simply isn't as fetching .  Gone are Enya's gorgeous voice, as well as the soaring and poignant melodies that characterized the first instalment.  Throw in a rather bizarre vocal at the end of the disc (Gollum's Song), and you have a series of offerings that fail to inspire the way its predecessor did.  Nice, but not outstanding.
B0000CDLA7|4.0|I find amusing the comparisons between the music from TOT and Metallica, Megadeth, and others.  Why is it amusing? Because Hetfield and co., and Mustane and co. at their absolute BEST can't come close to the WORST of Dream Theater.  Don't get me wrong, I like Metallica and Megadeth, but to compare DT to them  is like comparing Da Vinci to Matt Groening (you know, the creator of The Simpsons) They're talented musicians, but not even in the same league.<br />I would agree that TOT is a bit different, but these guys are all about stretching their boundaries.  It took me a few listenings to really get into this album, but once you gain familiarity, it's some amazing work (even more impressive when you consider they did it in what, two weeks?) give the album a couple of spins, preferrably on a good set of headphones, and I'm sure you will agree that this is an unbelievable collection of music.
B00000K2W1|4.0|How many white female rock singers can bury you with the sheer power of their voice... perhaps the pre-fried Grace Slick, or Ann Wilson of Heart on a good hair day?  If you're lookin' to be emotionally deep-sixed, there is no other choice than the wailin' Janis Joplin, and this 'Greatest Hits' collection will drive you down with sledgehammer blows one foot at a time.<br />Listening to Janis ravage these six numbers makes it clear what seperated her from every blues-rock singer to come before or after her... Janis seemed to have lived every line she sacrificed from her altar, the stage.  And given what she sang, it's no wonder that booze and drugs destroyed her life long before she was given the chance to really live it.  Life had to be a tortorous experience for Joplin, but she purged it all out on the stage and in the studio for everyone to gape at, and in a dark, disturbing, overwhelming way it is a great artistic gift.  It's all so real, you almost feel guilty watching it.  Ironically, Janis' more mellow work, perhaps symbolizing a degree of stability rising in her life, emerged only shortly before her tragic death.<br />The six songs that define Janis' meteorite like burn through the atmosphere of the late 1960's and 1970 are 'Piece Of My Heart', 'Try (Just a Little Bit Harder'), 'Cry Baby', 'Down On Me', 'Get It While You Can', and 'Move Over'.  While most anyone who was anywhere near the solar system in 1970 would be familiar with these songs, be advised that if you haven't heard even one of them you just ain't livin' yet.  Each is a study in what raw blues-rock is all about.  My personal favorite is the live version of 'Down On Me' (&quot;down&quot; as in put-down, not the Bill Clinton spin), recorded at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, aka The Fillmore Mid-West.  <br />To me, the rest of this album is filler, but it doesn't really matter.  'Bye Bye Baby', the earliest song on the CD by nearly two years (recorded in 1966), comes closest to deserving honorarium, and stylistically fits as well.  The same cannot be said for 'Me and Bobby McGee' or 'Mercedes Benz', which take the guts out of what Janis did best.  Don't get me wrong... they're nice songs, but to me 'nice' isn't what Janis should have ever aspired to.  The others, 'Summertime', 'Maybe', and even 'Ball and Chain' are too slow in tempo to kick-start Janis' ragin' torments.<br />I enjoy the instrumental backing Janis employed, especially when she was paired with Big Brother and the Holding Company.  There's some fine lead guitar licks that complement Janis' delivery like the slick on a Greaser's pomp.  For the most part though, what her bandmates do best is act as a sturdy soapbox for her powerful vocals. <br />Some reviews here knock this CD for what it doesn't have, but I say appreciate it for all it is.  If you're not really into getting a definitive collection of Janis' body of work, if you just want to throw on her best for a thiry minute aural workout, this disc is everything your two ears will be needing.  Program in the six-shooter outlined above, dial the morgue to come pick you up, and slip on the headphones...
B000002AH9|2.0|Having just read an article entitled the most essential jazz music of the past century I went and purchased ths Lady in Satin. This was an album that was professed to be one of the great ones. Powerfull and essential in Holiday's catalogue.<BR>I placed it into the CD palyer with great anticipation, first was the orchestration, big full and accurate. Then the horrific, screatching, off key shaky voice of the singer.<BR>I went onto the next track and more of the same. Fantastic big band orchestrations marred by this scared vioce. One track is an outtake and she speaks as if she was drunk ! I understand she had her hard times but at least the recording engineers could have taken the bottle out of her hands.<BR>This was a horrible let down.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I can't stop listening to this cd. Now this is from a person who really only listened to mainly rap/hip-hop before, I think this is saying a lot about Norah Jones and her absolutely beautiful voice. She has opened my ears to a whole style of music and overall has deeply influenced my musical tastes. Definitely in the top 3 albums in my book.
0156027321|4.0|This was an excellent book, I couldnt not put it down, and even read throughout lectures. It really makes you want to keep reading to find out what happens, and is funny in parts too. Overall, I would definatly recommend reading it.
B000002UA0|2.0|This album is not Pink Floyd.  I know that the band which recorded it was called Pink Floyd at the time, but it is not the Pink Floyd that achieved rock and roll greatness.  This album is so completely different from anything the band would accomplish after Syd Barrett's mental collapse, it might as well not even be a Pink Floyd album.  Syd can be credited with getting the band started and  writing an interesting psychedelic album, but his greatest accomplishment musically was being the inspiration for one of Floyd's greatest works, \\"Wish You Were Here\\".<br />Whether the album says Pink Floyd on the cover or not, it is not the greatest of psychedelia either.  If it is psychedelic music you are looking for, try out The Rolling Stones \\"Their Satanic Majesties Request\\" or The Beatles \\"Maigical Mystery Tour\\".  This album exists as an historical landmark of the beginning of Floyd and not much else.  The only tracks really worth listening to here are Astronomy Domine (which is vastly greater on the Ummagumma live disc) and Interstellar Overdrive, an interesting instrumental exploration.  The rest of the material is not without its merit, but I find it to be difficult to listen to.  Maybe it will grow on me, but not as a Pink Floyd work, but a Syd Barrett work.
1410102033|1.0|i started this book without any pretense of what made adolf hitler do what he did. reading through this book has given insight onto the reasons behind the actions of this man, a man with very askew ideas of Morality and Nationalism.<br />the thing about htis book is the way that is written. its not simple english by any means, nor are the sentences short, as sometimes they are paragraphs in themsleves. it is also dis-jointed when Hitler is trying to explain something, as hhe goes of to explain the problem in geat detail for pages at a time.<br />most of the book itself is about the political situation of germany and austria before and after World War 1 there is very little about the man himself, for reasons i cannot figure out.<br />i didnt like this book to much, even though i could understand what Hitler was saying, i didnt agree with any of it. plus it was overly long and slightly boring. this book isnt for everyone, well pretty much no one really. it was a over-looked pre cursor to the holocaust, and of WWW2.

B00003XAQ5|5.0|THE most interesting jazz sessions created by THE classic Miles lineup. This classic jazz album should be on every Top5 jazz album lists. <BR>What intrigues me most here is the fantastic sound of the SACD. I also have the previous gold CD version and a 70's repress LP, but the SACD version sounds so much better. It really feels like real instruments has entered my room. It's almost scary! I must admit I have a rather expensive stereo, and this SACD is one of the few digital records that really makes it worthwhile. How on earth was it possible to get a recording this good in 1959? The wind instruments are warm and with a wonderful timbre, but the most mindboggling is the dynamic drums and crystal clear cymbals. Hats off for Sony Columbia for a state-of-the-art remix and mastering!<BR>Should be mandatory in every SACD collection.
B00004W510|5.0|I purchsed this album when it 1st came out -- and as I was first coming over to rock from symphonic and early folk music.  Since that time, among the thousands of albums in my collection, this has always been my very favorite, most beloved music.  It has amazed me that whenever this music comes on -- whatever the mood or setting -- I am *always* happy to hear it.<br />I feel similarly about The Band's other 2 initial albums -- Music from Big Pink and Stage Fright -- but this one's even finer.  Each voice is powerful, resonant and evocative. Each composition is strong.  Each line, each instrument played is \\"just right\\" harmonically and rhythmically, and the ensemble is as tight as any music I know.  At the same time, each player's work -- especially the bewilderingly wonderful Garth Hudson keboards -- is so complex and well conceived that new discoveries within each song still reveal themsleves to me, even after thousands of listenings.  How can that be true?!  It can be so only with the very finest of all music.<br />The bonus tracks here include rehearsals which show the arrangements in mid-form, some steps leading to the synthesis as ultimately recorded.<br />Best known of this classic ensemble, Robbie Robertson with his guitar contrasts some with the rest.  His playing is spare, tighter than anything I've heard, and always incisive.  Yet for me, the other instruments and vocals are more central to the full presentations.  This said, it is clear Roberston's role in it all was crucial, and not only as guitarist.  After he left The Band, some of the fire dropped away.  Robertson had contributed beyond anything tangible he brought.  Their later albums, recorded after a very long hiatus, are excellent but nowhere near the level of the 1st 3.<br />When I've seen these folks in person, I have been astonished to see that they switch instruments with each other during the set, and each player is excellent playing any instrument!<br />The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down is the best known in this colletion, having been covered by many other artists -- notably Joan Baez, in a 'nice' track, but completely outshone by the original.  Yet this Band track -- wonderful as it is -- must for me bow to the even more stunning yet varied tracks:  King Harvest, When You Awake, Look Out Cleveland, Rockin Chair...and, yes, Rag Mama Rag and Up on Cripple Creek.  The great Little Feat cover Rag Mama Rag on their Down Upon the Suwannee River, and do it well.  But any cover of this music is simply superfluous.Down is the best known in this colletion, having been covered by many other artists -- notably Joan Baez, in a 'nice' track, but completely outshone by the original.

B00003CX9E|5.0|It's unfortunate that some contemporary viewers raised on high concept video, low-brow comedy, and wall-to-wall explosions can't appreciate the quality and value of a film like &quot;Citizen Kane.&quot; Simply put, this film is the very foundation of modern filmmaking. Techniques so common as to be invisible to a contemporary audience, techniques that make film seem real and natural rather than staged and artificial were established by Welles in the making of &quot;Kane&quot;. And the story of media, power and politics is as timely and telling today as it was when the film was made (perhaps moreso). There may be movies with singularly better stories, singularly better acting, cinematography, etc. etc., but taken as a whole and in view of it's impact and influence on filmmaking in general, &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; IS the single greatest American movie ever made.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Isn't it exciting to see a promising new talent blossom and grow? With `Lost In Translation', we have the unique pleasure of watching three such talents bloom and find themselves. The first one is, of course, director Sofia Coppola, daughter of the grand master Francis Ford, and a proud collaborator in the family business. `Lost In Translation' is only her second feature film, but all the promises made by her debut, the acclaimed `Virgin Suicides', is fulfilled in this movie. Though it shares with its predecessor a kind of drowsy, atmospheric slowness, `Lost In Translation' is a much better structured movie, and shows Sofia truly on her way as both director and writer. It earned her an Oscar for best original screenplay, and golden globes for best screenplay and best film (comedy / musical).<br />The second is young actress Scarlett Johansson. I had my eye on Scarlett since I saw her in two of my favorite films of recent years - Terry Zwigoff's `Ghost World' and the Coen Brothers' `The Man Who Wasn't There'. She played supporting roles in both movies, yet I was still impressed, and not just because of her young age (in `Ghost World' she plays a highschool graduate along with Thora Birch, yet she is two years younger than Birch - she was only 16 when the movie was made!) This year, though, we can see her in two leading roles - in `Lost In Translation' and `Girl With Pearl Earring' - and in `Lost In Translation', she really proves that she's a talent to be reckoned with.<br />The third is - yes, that's right, Bill Murray. So, yes, he's been around for nearly a quarter of a century now, but we never really thought of him as much of an actor, right? Good though he was in `Ghostbusters' and `Groundhog Day', never before have I imagined him to be anything more than a comedian actor, and capable of playing a lead dramatic character successfully. In `Lost In Translation' he is both funny and touching, and his performance is worthy of an Oscar.<br />`Lost In Translation' isa beautiful, moody, atmospheric little piece of perfect cinema from a young director just beginning to show what she has to offer. It moves very slowly and has very little plot, but never gets dull. Altogether, it's one of the best and most intelligent films of the year. Very highly recommended.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|(...) Cannibal Corpse is one of the only bands in this genre that have persevered for over a decade and a half while sticking to a pure american brutal death metal style and continue to churn out increasingly better albums year after year. Nightloaf: \\"The vocals are just really bad, and to me, sound like a more extreme version of Johnathon Davis from Korn.\\" That statement makes me wonder if you can hear at all, Corpsegrinder's vocals are Death Metal defined. Nightloaf: \\"The double blast beats as in all brutal death metal, are annoying, and just do not sound right to the music. Playing drums so fast to me makes it sound like they are way off with the rest of the music.\\" This has got to take the cake as the dumbest thing you said. Alex Webster and Paul Mazurkiewicz have one of the tightest rhythm sections in death metal. Paul's drumming has really matured and on this recording you can hear how varied and complex his rhythms can get. All in all I'd say this is the tightest production from C.C. yet and with the bonus DVD this package is indespensible for any true fan.(...)

Oddly enough, when I watched the second DVD's &quot;making of&quot; feature, the video quality of the clips seemed considerably better.  That's backwards. <br /> While the sound mix was somewhat improved, you still think your listening to an old Dolby Pro Logic mix at best.  I do have a fairly high end system with HD projection, so the stage is there for a well mastered DVD to perform.    <br />Having said that, this movie has one of the best sustained action sequences out there.

Frodo is taken to the tower of Cirth Ungol and is saved by Sam. Then they move closer the fires of Mount Doom. While Frodo and Sam are moving towards Mt. Doom the rest of the fellowship is creating a war a a diversion. Will they trick Sauron or will he get the Ring? To find out read this book. <BR> I liked this book because my favorite genre has always been fantasies. I feel that the book is well written and has unforgettable characters. The book is special because of it settings. I'm recommending it because it is one of my favorite books of all time. I would rate the book five out of five stars. Any type of person would like this book.<br />Drew O., Grade 6<BR>Bales Intermediate, Friendswood , Texas
B0000CEB4V|5.0|In addition to featuring definitive versions of several Harrison tunes, this concert also features moments that are as improbable as they are wonderful: Jeff Lynne doing Harrison's Indian-inspired \\"The Inner Light\\"; Paul McCartney singing the first half of \\"Something\\" solo, accompanied by just his ukelele; and most surreal of all, McCartney taking the lead on \\"All Things Must Pass\\", a Harrison song which he and John Lennon refused to put on a Beatles album because they claimed it wasn't good enough.<br />In fact McCartney's presence in the show seemed needlessly awkward. Aside from receiving a hug from Clapton, everyone else onstage appeared to go out of their way to ignore Paul, which was a shame.  All rumors about personality issues aside, the fact remains Paul was one of Harrison's oldest friends, as was Ringo Starr, so both should have been given much larger roles in the show, e.g. Harrison's early works from \\"Help!\\" and \\"Revolver\\" should have been performed by McCartney, Clapton, Dhani Harrison and Starr.  It would have been more appropriate, and the impact would have been much greater.<br />If I have any overall gripe about \\"Concert for George\\", it's that far too many people were onstage most of the time.  Does any band need four (or was it five) drummers?  Starr and Ray Cooper would have been more than enough for this set. Gary Brooker was redundant on keyboards with McCartney, Billy Preston and Jools Holland all present.  Andy Fairweather-Low, Marc Mann and others picked up many of the signature Harrison guitar riffs which Clapton should have handled.  And so on.  Some of the songs wound up losing some of their subtle nuances because of all the clutter onstage.<br />As for the comedic extras, I think parents who brought their kids to the show (there appeared to be quite a few) could have done without hearing \\"Sit On My Face\\" and \\"The Lumberjack Song\\".  I know I could have lived without it.  Yes, I'm aware of Harrison's connection with Monty Python, but frankly their appearance here was forced and misplaced, especially right after ten minutes of a sublimely beautiful and intricate Indian raga.<br />Which brings up one last complaint: where were \\"Within You, Without You\\" and \\"What is Life\\"?  Particularly the former, this is the one Harrison song that literally changed the course of pop music history, and I found it inexplicable (not to mention hugely disappointing) that they assembled all the necessary backup musicians, yet did not perform the song.  As good as \\"The Inner Light\\" is, it pales in comparison.<br />But these are all relatively minor quibbles, and I'm judging the show against absolute perfection.  The fact remains this is still probably the best tribute concert ever recorded, and is a MUST SEE for any George Harrison fan, Beatles fan, Eric Clapton fan, or anyone else who enjoys wonderful music.
B00006M183|3.0|On 'I am Mine' and 'Thumbing My Way,' Eddie's voice sounds like Mark Knopfler.  That's the main point I am making on this review.<br />I also don't care to hear politics mixed in with albums.  I agree that listeners who may not agree with the singer will possibly be turned off, as I am.  Unnecessary.  Seems to degrade the album.
B00009L1OB|4.0|By the time Duran Duran's 1983 \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" came out, its platinum success was all but guaranteed.  At that point, the Birmingham-based group was already a staple on MTV and had their first two albums in Billboard's Top Ten.  Typically, each Duran Duran album sounds different from the one that preceded it, and the weirdly named \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" is no exception.  They replaced producer Colin Thurston (who did the first two records) with Alex Sadkin and Ian Little, who were responsible for Duran Duran's smash hit \\"Is There Something I Should Know.\\"  The result is a slightly arty, more sophisticated sound that bears no resemblance to their 1981 self-titled debut.  The record spawned three top ten singles, one of which, \\"The Reflex,\\" went on to become their first American Number One single.  Other interesting album cuts are the dynamic \\"Of Crime and Passion,\\" \\"Shadows on Your Side,\\" and the sax-flavored instrumental \\"Tiger Tiger.\\"  \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" has been remastered (there are no bonus tracks), and the sound quality is a decent improvement over the original CD pressing.  Narrow-minded rock connoisseurs may scoff at both this band and this album, but \\"Seven and the Ragged Tiger\\" is still a fine effort from Duran Duran in its original, five-member lineup.
0783225857|1.0|I have NO idea why everyone is always talking about how moving this movie was. I saw it and it was AWFUL. I wasted a few hours of my day watching a boring, slow paced, black and white film about nothing. Scout was OBNOXIOUS!!! Her father was so boring, Jem was the only character with a personality. if you want a REAL movie about racism watch Higher Learning, Roots, or best of all Do The Right Thing. I would never reccommend this movie EVER.
B00005JMEW|5.0|The first Thing comes to people minds reading these reviews is ( should i seek watching this movie ..should i buy it ? ).........<BR>well, the answer here is YES<BR>Kill Bill is one of the best action movies appeared in the last couple of years ..i guarantee that.<BR>Kill Bill's plot is kind of old story ( a woman takes revenge from all those tried to kill her ) , BUT director, Quantan Tarantino proves that a skilled director is able to produce an ordinary consumed story with a total new vision and rhythm ..!!<BR>the movie is inspired by the action movies of the 70s period , asian action movies and Manga ( japanese comic books )..and that appears vividly in every single detail with in the movie.<BR>much effort is done in this movie , so u'd see Excellent Action , Excellent Acting, Excellent Music and Sound Effects and Excellent Visual Effects.<BR>THe Director Quantin Tarantino Used his Tools very well , and such a unique , New way..<BR>THe way the time sequence is used is very impressing..he didn't put every thing in order..actually he did put some Past events After the recent ones...putting them in order of the events of Less Importance To these of more Importance.<BR>Music and sound effects are perfect ...the use of music is so good, music here gives more dimensions to the events..not just a background parallel to the picture..here they mingle together..(there's a very nice fight with swords with a music of a spanish dance ).<BR>Acting ...since the movie is full of action much more than conversations, the actors made great effort to appeal their feelings by eye contact and physical movements..well they did it very well, specialy Lucy Liu ( You'll see her in kill bill as u never seen her before )..and of course Uma Thurman.<BR>my last comments :<BR>- the movie have lot of Blood and offending scenes ..so if you are offended and disturbed by such scenes ..don't watch this movie.<BR>- Kill Bill vol 1 is such a big TEASER ..you will wait impatiently for Kill Bill vol 2...
0783240236|4.0|This is as scary as Oprah on an atkins diet. Don't be afraid, afraid of the birrrrrrds! Quit it. This is a movie and replicates the book perfectly. See for yourself. I never had interest in this movie, but when i saw it for myself. KA-BANG! An instant horror. Good Job Alfred Hitchcock!
B000099T2L|1.0|This is possibly the worst album ever recorded. I think dogs barking would be more appealing to my ears. If you really must have this trash just download it for free. She shouldn't make a dime on this crap.
0385504209|1.0|When I first picked up The DaVinci Code, I'll admit I was curious.  Almost immediately the reader is catapulted into an intense Parisian murder scene at the Louvre. I was into it, really into it, I actually devoted up to six hours of a saturday to read this book. However, I found myself shaking my head more and more saying, &quot;no, this is ridiculous.&quot; And then there just came a point when I said no to the whole idea of it. The distortion of facts about DaVinci and his paintings is just TOO much.  Not only does the book become a complete farce, but the writing deteriorates at a rapid pace as well.  The whole thriller starts unraveling with laughable coincidence that springs up from places where you would most obviously expect.<br />The person I really felt bad for after putting this book down was the man who had been defamed with no way to save himself, that would be Leonardo DaVinci. Readers would be wiser to pick up an actual art history book that truthfully follows this master painter.
B00005B36H|5.0|Truly an exceptional album, this latest tool release defies description.  This band has grown more and more impressive with each release.  Lateralus is more than a 'metal' or 'prog-metal' album, or whatever you want to call it.  Rather, Lateralus can easily take its place besides other incredible song cycles such as Dark Side of the Moon and OK Computer.  The way this band interacts as a whole is what sets tool apart, and makes them worlds better than a perfect circle (also an excellent band). Whereas Maynard is clearly the focus of APC, here his voice is just one of the instruments that add up to form this swirling, grooving, intensity building masterpiece.  The lenghthy tracks work better for tool as it allows each piece to grow to a shattering climax.  The final 3 song cycle at the close of the album (Disposition, reflection and Triad) pretty much sum up for me what tool is all about.  Like the best Led Zeppelin, Tool expertly uses lighter sounds and textures to contrast with the heavier passages.  Lateralus even surpasses Tool's other great masterpiece, Aenema, because unlike Aenema, there isn't a wasted second on this album.  They have cut out the filler songs so prevalent on Aenema (that album has 9 really outstanding songs amidst 15 tracks, the rest being mostly unsuccessful sonic experiments), and the songs on Lateralus all feel like parts of a coherent whole.  Don't get me wrong, Aenema is also a 5 star album and one of my favorites.  It is just that, in my opionion, Lateralus is even better.  In summary, one of the very finest albums I own.  5 very deserving stars.
B0000CFW87|5.0|This is one of the best cds I've purchased in a long time. Josh's voice is so powerful and so effortless- this is what singers should sound like. I blare this cd because it's more beautiful with more amps! The music is beautiful and even though I don't speak another language, the non-English pieces are beautiful.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|This is definitely one of my best cd's I have. I heard some progg rock before, but nothing that can be labeled christian. I have loved this cd from the day I got it. It gives a story about how Neal Morse became christian. Very powerful. It gives hope to those who try but don't find God first, and then fall of. I think That the story of Neal Morse is something many both christians and they who seek can associate with.<br />I think that the lyrics are the most important in every song, but it should have a good music preformance as well. This is something Neal Morse is an expert to. Veery good lyrics and the use of instruments is fantastic. Melodic, and not to heavy.<br />I like the way &quot;colder in the sun&quot; links with &quot;Power in the air&quot;. with the locked door and the opening one... amazing use of pictures and methaphores.<br />This is a must!
0761957553|5.0|I have spend lots of bucks in finding a appropriate book that explains the basics of statistics. Majority of the books claims that they provide the basics but they often use jargons, and contains lack of simple explanation, usage of proper technique and interpretation.  But this is not the case with this book.  This book starts with explaining the fundamentals in very plain and easy to understand language.  I got a feeling that statistics is not at all tough and is fun provided if we have good explanation as in this book.  This book provides you with teh basics, choosing correct stat and interpreting and the bonus part is it demonstrates how to carry out stat in spss.  Very easy to understand and I wish i could have this book before i spend lots of bucks.  I thank you to the writer for providing such an excellent book.
0312995423|4.0|It's at least Dan Brown trying his best to come up with something at least a little closer to high tech science fiction and cyberpunk, such as &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;, and so forth.

6300209717|5.0|Wanna know why I yelled that at you? Cos this set is the superior set to the current dvd set. The soundtrack is original (and WAY better, imo, esp with the sound effects which makes these films funnier). The film quality is just as good as the set that Turner Classic Movies showed last night. Luckily this set is available at my library and I have rented it just about every year cos it's so good! I wish I could transfer these to dvd if I had the capabilites. The Pawnshop (on this volume, with The Adventurer and One AM) is my favourite Mutual with The Cure (on volume 3) at a close 2nd place. Unfortunately this set is out of print so go looking on eBay for these tapes!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is an impenetrable chick flick featuring Bill Murray in acting so low-key I thought I was watching Kim Novak in Bell, Book &amp; Candle.  The scenery is LOW, LOW budget (like Ginsu knives), the non-English is apparently improvised -- in fact background dialogs are directed as &quot;wall of sound&quot; noise, and subtitles are NOT available.  The high point of the script is a sophomoric flipwit about Yale philosophy majors working pro bono, and it doesn't get better.  Coppola made it out of the basin ok in Godfather I, but she drowns in this one.
B00005LMBK|1.0|I am sorry but this album is really really really bad. It is not really that artistic. It is just a bunch of people talking throughout the whole album to a certain beat.The only thing that I can say that is remotely positive is the animations.Besides that I wouldn't recommmend this album at all.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|This by far is Cannibal Corpse's Best CD...From Start to Finish is it just Amazing..Great Riffs, Solo's. George is screaming, singing like never before..The catchy riff, chorus in Nothing Left To Mutilate says it all...This album should also but to end all those Fisher vs Barnes....Album of 2004
B000089CJI|5.0|I LOVE, LOVE LOVE this album! The music reminds me of a video game. Like some amazing level that I never reached but always strived for. Lyrically it is pure poetry. I usually listen to nothing but Aimee Mann but we have parted ways since I began listening to The Postal Service. Love at first listen.
B00005QXDD|5.0|I bought this CD based on the reviews here, and I have not been disppointed. In fact, I'm in love with the songs! &quot;Tribute&quot; and &quot;Lee&quot; are awesome, and just TRY to get the gorgeously melodic &quot;Wonder Boy&quot; out of your head. I dare you! The rest of the album is simply silly, hard-rockin' fun. It will Rock Your Socks off! And the skits in between the songs will definitely make you laugh. &quot;Drive Thru&quot; is a crack up! Tenacious D is a delight!
0312995423|2.0|I did get hooked into reading this book, so I give it two stars, for its &quot;thriller&quot; nature.<br />The content reads like it is science fiction written by an English major who didn't do enough research into the science part of his fiction (which, of course, it is).  The mumbo-jumbo about &quot;replication strings&quot; and viruses just wasn't at all convincing.  Yes, in sci-fi you need to suspend disbelief but in good sci-fi, that's just for one leap.  Every time Brown described the encryption stuff, I just wanted to scream.<br />Then, the characters were one-dimentional, particularly, a couple of the fanatical villains.<br />If you're bored, you might want to read this book.  Otherwise, find something more productive to do with your time.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Generally speaking,i find that so many people like to offer an opinion about an album with few of the necessary required ingredients for making an objective and helpful review. Having said this, i am probably one fo these people myself. However,i weould like to state two facts about the band jet. As far as creating an album that sounds like a purely production savvy work - Not true. The simple reason being, as a live band they are fantastic, mixing both skill with raw energy. And as far as being just a cover band, re-hashing already founded styles? who cares? isnt that missing the point of good music? besides if you think that there is such a thing as originality you are probably mistaken, as everything comes from some sort of an amalgamation of influences. The album is a collage of different classic rock moments, and is well put together, which is backed up by an almost flawless on stage performance.
0385504209|5.0|Dan's Brown book &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; had me hooked. It was absolutley a great book filled with adventure and thrills. Definitley a page turner. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great book to read.<br />I also recommend &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; by Dan Brown.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said in the 700+ reviews (as of today) for this series.  As a longtime Buffy the Vampire Slayer (and Joss Whedon) fan, I was willing to give this show a chance when it first came out and was blown away by the show - so much so that it was likely to surpass Buffy as one of my favorite shows of all time.  Unfortunately, the Fox programming geniuses were apparently more out of touch with their viewers' taste than I'd thought.  Whedon has produced some of the most exciting, original, well scripted, beautifully filmed, and most promising tv series I've ever seen and has been passed over or cancelled by not one, but two networks for these shows.  Maybe he's destined for actual film production and, hopefully a wider appreciation of his talents as a writer and producer.  I'd peg Firefly as the perfect vehicle for his transition to the big screen.
B00018D44U|5.0|This sophomore effort by Jones shows much growth and an overall sense of energetic propulsion not seen in her first CD COME AWAY WITH ME.  While her previous effort was a bit weighed-down by a languid, lazy approach, here Jones clings much more to a country/western style which actually infuses her voice with a new found energy.   The duet &quot;Creepin' In&quot; with Dolly Parton is a highlight, as is the opening track &quot;Sunrise&quot;, penned by Jones herself.<br />It's nice to see Jones injecting some much needed adrenaline into her overwise laid back style.   As far as sophomore albums go, this one totally avoids the &quot;slump&quot; other artists have encountered. <br />It makes me look forward to her 3rd CD..in the hopes she will only add to her energy and enthusiasm for new styles and ranges.<br />The voice continues to mesmerize, not with power or flashy vocal stylings, but with a sort of lazy afternoon infusion.   But while her first album made you sleepy, this one keeps you plugged in and wanting more.
B000001Y16|5.0|Some people recognize 2Pac for All Eyez on Me. I say that's not true. That LP is highly overrated. Pure 2Pac is what is displayed on this STUNNING album. His lyrical genius and immaculate and unreplicable flow combine to produce a hip hop classic, even though most people (inculding the media) don't even recognize this album. This album is DEEP AND DARK AND POWERFUL. It is Tupac doing what he did best. A MUST FOR ANY MUSIC FAN. WHETHER U LISTEN TO RAP, ROCK, COUNTRY, CLASSICAL, POP OR DANCE, EVERYONE NEEDS THIS ALBUM. This is one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. It beats All Eyez On Me, Life After Death by Biggie and even Illmatic by Nas. U NEED IT.<br />I'm a break it down song by song.<br />1. Bomb First<BR>This track is PHAT! Some of his most amazing lyrics and complex ideas are displayed on this track. IT IS AMAZING! Beat is phat too. 10/10<br />2. Hail Mary<BR>Pac gettin spiritual and reflective. BRILLIANT LYRICS &amp; BEAT. Stunning. This is a Pac classic. 10/10<br />3. Toss it Up<BR>2Pac gettin down. This 1 is 4 tha dance floor. Phat beats. 7/10<br />4. To Live and Die in LA<BR>What can I say? STUNNING TRACK. Pac getting emotional and reflective on this track. Beat is mad. One of the best on the whole album. 11/10<br />5. Blasphemy<BR>2Pac is gettin' WAY deep and dark and meaningful on this track. Outdoes himself with this track lyrically. Kinda hard to understand, but it sinks in WAY DEEP. 12/10.<br />6. Life of an Outlaw<BR>Pac going thug life and street. Lyrics are UNBELIEVABLE. One of Pac's best. EVER. 13/10.<br />7. Just like Daddy<BR>Traditional 2Pac. Going storyteller, such as in Brenda's got a Baby, Part Time Mutha, Baby Don't Cry, Mamma's Just a Little Girl, etc. As with all of Pac's storytellers, this is AWESOME. Pac's lyrics are immaculate, as always. Great beats as well. 8/10.<br />8. Krazy<BR>Pac almost outdoes the lyrics from BLASPHEMY on this track. Beats are really slow and dark, mad. Pac does well though, really DARK and MEANINGFUL.8/10<br />9. White Man's World<br />I cant give this track a rating. It is SO UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING AND POWERFUL, it doesn't even need one. Pac going really emotional and political on this joint, which is what he did best. Stunning. U HAVE 2 hear it 4 yourselves. BEST TRACK ON THE ENTIRE ALBUM.<br />10. Me and My Girlfriend<BR>Great track. Pac going storyteller again. Some complex ideas in this one, u have to hear it yourselves. Beats are phat too. 9/10<br />11. Hold Ya Head<BR>Pac going in tradition of Keep Ya Head Up, Baby Don't Cry. Lyrics are good, beats are kinda weak. Worst track on tha album. 6/10<br />12. Against all Odds<BR>Before I heard this, I thought it was going to be awesome. I was SADLY dissapointed in the production of this track. Lyrics are aiiight, but beats are wack. Ideas are pretty hard 2 understand on this joint. 6/10<br />2Pac's lyrical genius pulls serious emotional triggers. It is amazing how he can touch people with his meaningful words. HE IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE GREATEST SONGWRITER THIS WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. Political, Racial and Emotional issues are dealt with on this masterpiece, which leaves you thinkin' DEEP, brothaz and sistaz. His mind created songs which left their mark on the worldwide stage, because he was always true and always dealt with things true. THIS ALBUM IS DEEEEEEEEEP AND POWERFUL, Y'ALL. His deepest ever. A true gem. Everyone needs a copy to witness his lyrical genius.<BR>Rest in Peace Tupac Amaru Shakur, the greatest songwriter this world has EVER seen. We miss you.
B00014NE62|5.0|I first became aquainted with this movie one night while doing the old channel surfing thing. I happened to land on a scene from a movie in which a man is lying in bed, tormented over something. He then moves to a window, to view the outside darkness. Not seeing anything, he returns to his bed, only to look back at the window, to view the house gamekeeper climbing up a ladder for an illicit rendez-vous. I was mesmerized, closeted, and seeing for the first time a depiction of love between two men. Thus I sat enchanted watching \\"Maurice\\", created from the magnificent Merchant Ivory studios.<br />Maurice is based from an E. M. Forster book posthumously published due to its scandolous nature. Maurice, brilliantly portrayed by  is a man torn between his role in society and his inner feelings. At Cambridge, he meets Clive Durham, played by a young dashing Hugh Grant, who becomes his first great love. Turmoil and tumult ensues, as the men wrestle with their love for each other versus society expectations. As Clive gives into the pressure, Maurice is sent wandering with his feelings, until he meets the saucy, somewhat illiterate gamekeeper Scudder, played by Rupert Graves, which only fuels the dichotomy.<br />Never pandering to audiences, this film respects the story and its characters. They are equally rich and complex, as the giant behemoth of society constantly dictates what they must do or accept of each other. Yet despite each characters weaknesses and flaws, they manage to find ways to overcome those expectations. The story is as rich as any Merchant Ivory production, and the quality shows.<br />The performances by all the leads is extremely commendable.  They convey the love, confusion, and sincerety of their characters without ever going over the top. Especially Graves, who's character in English society at the time had the least status, manages to give him the most dignity as he pursues a man he loves. An equally fine supporting cast, from the brilliant Denholm Elliott to the amazing Judy Parfitt, give this move the credence and weight it deserves.<br />Also commendable, this movie does not shy away at all from the sexuality included as part of the story. What's amazing is that this movie was made back in 1987, yet it treats the homosexual romance with the same reverence and respect as a heterosexual romance. It's refreshing how a series of films in the eights, from this to Parting Glances, truly were revolutionary.<br />Finally, this movie's transfer to DVD is incredible. The movie is beautfiul, rich, and colorful. I have yet to see a finer transfer as the quality is superb. It is a scrumptious feast to watch. DVD collectors wishing to have high quality movies in this medium certainly won't want to pass up these disks.<br />This movie will always hold a special place in my heart, and now I own the DVD version to treasure and watch without having to channel surf. I cannot recommend Maurice enough, or thank Merchat Ivory enough for producing such a high quality movie.iott to the amazing Judy Parfitt, give this move the credence and weight it deserves.<br />Also commendable, this movie does not shy away at all from the sexuality included as part of the story.

B00015HVI8|4.0|This series is definitely a favourite of mine.   I love the stories, and the acting is great as expected!   The DVD is extra special with the audio commentaries that always have me laughing outloud (especially Martin Wood's and Peter Deluise)!   And extra bonus was the Director's Featurettes, again by Martin and Peter - they're brilliant to watch!<br />My only complaint - and why it doesn't get the five stars - Where on earth are the captions!!!   This is really sad in this day in age for a DVD to be released without captions for the deaf and hearing impaired!!!<br />Great DVD, but for that!
B00005Y228|5.0|This is easily Kylie Minogue's strongest album to date, and definitely one of the top 5 Dance albums of the last 10 years.<br />Every single track is infused with the right combination of danceability, technical energy and smooth vocals.  If this one doesn't get you off your butt and up on the dance floor, nothing will.<br />At her best, Kylie reminds us of a mid-80's Madonna.   It's impossible not to get up and dance to \\"More More More\\" or \\"Love at First Sight\\".  The joy, the energy is so palpable it can't help but move the listener to get up and shake it.<br />An excellent dance album that should be in everyone's collection.
B00005JLO2|3.0|Harry Faversham, a young British officer, decides to resign from the British military as he faces his fears of an imminent war in Sudan.  In turn Harry receives four white feathers, as a symbol of his cowardice, from his closest friends and his father who renounces him.  Harry also looses his fianc&eacute;'s confidence and trust as she is questioning how she will be perceived by people.  Harry ponders his situation and quickly realizes that he has sunken deeper than he expected and must find a way to regain self-respect and self-worth.  Four feathers is an adventurous story that takes place in the British colony Sudan during the end of the 1800s, which offers both drama and tragedy as war does for all affected parties.
B000002UA5|5.0|When I first heard this record at my friend's house, I just wondered how unpredictable and impressive Pink Floyd can be on every album! As for the studio CD, you may feel paralysed while listening to it, as you look up to their obvious talent and musical singularity.<br />The instrumental lines are sweetly climatic, which offers the listener certain moments of reflection, sadness and mistery.<BR>Undeniably the three-part song called \\"The Narrow Way\\" stands out for its mood and sound evolution, growing to a bombastic gruitar work by Gilmour. <br />The live recording is energetic and absolutely creative. The band members show off with their improvisation skills, turning the classics \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and \\"Careful with that axe, Eugene\\" into live peaks from the 60s. <br />I reviewed \\"Ummagumma\\" (synonimous for \\"sex\\") as a five-star album because it deserves all compliments on its brilliance and originallity. The only weak point here is the slow-pace and repetitive drum beat by Mason on the last track. Just an ending that disappoints for being relatively boring...
B00005JMJ4|4.0|The movie was a good story, but left me wanting something that had some bite to it.  Bill Murray showed how versatile his comedic style was.
0802136834|5.0|I have always had a soft spot for King Henry VIII's wives and enjoyed reading about them, but never have I come across such a detailed, colorful, and engaging biography of them as this. Alison Weir has done a phenomenal amount of research in compiling this book. She provides us with countless details of the lives of these women, including excerpts from letters written by, addressed to, or about them. She also dispells many of the myths that have grown up around the six Queens. For instance, Anne Boleyn was not the promiscuous wanton she has often been described as, and Jane Seymour may not have been quite as sweet and innocent in nature as most people believed her to be. Coupled with her easy, fluid writing style, this factual detail brings each of the women to life. We get to know them intimately as Weir unlocks their widely varied personalities.<br />Katherine of Aragon (mother of Queen 'Bloody' Mary) was a loving and devoted wife to Henry for 24 years. When he ultimately cast her aside in hopes of finding a more fruitful wife (one who would provide him with a male heir, which Katherine had failed to do), she firmly maintained that she was the King's true wife, the Queen, and always would be. For the rest of her life, she never permitted anyone to call her anything but 'Queen', even though she lived out her last miserable years in a dank, unhealthy estate, with insufficient resources.<br />Anne Boleyn (mother of Queen Elizabeth I) was an outspoken and ambitious young woman, originally one of Katherine's waiting women. She caught the King's attention and Henry developed an overwhelming passion for her. His desire to rid himself of Katherine and marry Anne ultimately led the King to break with the Roman Catholic Church, something scandalous and unthinkable to most of his contemporaries. Unfortunately for her, Anne lacked sufficient discretion, and her political oponents found it all too easy to lay upon her false accusations that would result in her execution.<br />Henry once said that he loved Jane Seymour best of all his wives, perhaps because she succeeded where his other wives had failed - she gave Henry his heir, Edward VI. But Jane, much loved by many Englanders, did not occupy the position of Queen for long. Shortly after the birth of her son, she succumbed to infection and died. Henry remembered her as his favorite for the rest of his life, and ordered that he be buried at her side when he died.<br />Anne of Cleves, the shortest-lasting of Henry's Queens, was ultimately the most successful of the six women. Henry arranged to marry the German princess based solely on seeing one portrait of her. This portrait, however, had exaggerated her appearance, and when the King saw his new wife he was repulsed. He immediately sought a way out of the marriage. Anne could have faced a grimmer fate, except that she was cheerfully compliant where Katherine had been stubborn. The marriage was annulled with ease and the King, grateful for her cooperation, provided Anne with property, funds, and a title as his honorary sister.<br />Henry's next wife was not so fortunate. Katherine Howard was was only a young girl when she married the King, who thought of her as 'a rose without a thorn.' In Katherine, he found a way to recapture his youth. But Katherine was young and silly, and worst of all, sexually promiscuous. When the king found out, he was shattered, and Katherine soon followed in the footsteps of her predecessor and cousin, Anne Boleyn, and was executed before the age of 17.<br />Katherine Parr, Henry's sixth and final wife, served a different function than those who had come before her. By this time the aging King was in failing health and exceedingly fat. Katherine became more of a nursemaid for him, as well as a companion with whom he could converse. Within a few years, the King died, leaving Katherine a widow, free and in charge of her own fate. She re-married and had a daughter by her new husband, but died shortly afterward.<br/>The book is long, but well worth the read. Weir has done an extraordinary job of introducing us to these vibrant, diverse women. The book is full of information, facts, quotes - but the writing is very digestible and flows smoothly. Henry's first two wives are given the most attention - Katherine because she lasted the longest, and Anne because she has been saddled with such an infamous reputation. The other wives are not described in so much detail, but we still get to know them quite well. Weir takes us through the entire lives of these women, from their childhood and time before marrying the king, through the ends of their lives (which, in the cases of Anne of Cleves and Katherine Parr, extended beyond the King's own death).<br />Included in the book are several black and white images - mostly paintings of Henry, his family, his advisors, and of course, his wives. I would have liked to see these printed in color, but they are nice enough as is. At the back of the book, Weir has included genealogical tables of England's royal dynasties, the Tudor family, and each of Henry's wives. This is an extremely helpful reference for keeping track of the connections between various nobles that involved in the lives of the King and the women he married. 'The Six Wives of Henry VIII' was a great read, and I would highly recommend it./>The book is long, but well worth the read.

B000002LND|5.0|This is by far the best Madonna Album ever released.  It has all of her greatest hits from the first half of her career, and I don't think she left any big hits out.  The second greatest hits collection that came out in 2001 failed to do what Immaculate Collection did.  Greatest Hits Volume 2 didn't do well because it didn't have all the biggest hits from Madonna's second part of her career.  There were many left out and some that weren't included.  Immaculate Collection came out over a decade ago, and still sells big because people want a Madonna album full of all her first big hits.  I gave it 5 stars because it deserves nothing less.  If anything it deserves 6 stars.

1400031362|5.0|Morality for Beautiful Girls is the third novel in the series about Precious Ramotswe and her detective agency in Botswana, and covers the period of one month after the events in Tears of the Giraffe.  Be sure to read The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency and Tears of the Giraffe before this book, or you will probably think this story is a three star effort.  Many reviews describe these books as mysteries . . . but they are really novels about a woman who sometimes solves problems for people.  Since the first book, the &quot;mysteries&quot; have not been very mysterious, and the appeal of the books lies far apart from the mysteries.<br />In Morality for Beautiful Girls, Alexander McCall Smith takes a thorough look at the pros and cons of the old communal values found in Botswana's villages compared to the new morality of the urbanizing young in that country.  In the process, Mr. Smith makes a powerful case for grafting onto the old values an appreciation for ingenuity, education, effort, organization and courage while dismissing most of the new morality as misinformed at best, and harmful at worst.  In so doing, he eloquently describes the potential benefits of a matriarchic society led by determined, talented women who break down traditional boundaries that limit both men and women.<br />As the story opens, Precious realizes that her concept of helping all those who need her help, regardless of ability to pay, is going to leave the detective agency in perpetual financial trouble.  Having agreed to marry Mr J.L.B. Matekoni, who runs a prosperous car repair business, Precious looks at ways to reduce her costs by sharing their resources.  Her conclusion:  She should move the detective agency to the garage, share Mma Makutsi's time and salary with the garage, and rent out the building she has been using for the agency.  All seems to be off to a good start when Mr Matekoni begins acting strangely.  With her burgeoning responsibilities and plans, Precious has just too much to do.  So she delegates as many items on her &quot;to do&quot; list as possible to others, and gets going on what only she can do.  It's like reading a lesson in time management.<br />During the course of the story, you will meet another unusual youngster who ends up at the orphanage.  Precious is caught up in a case of potential poisoning at the behest of a powerful government official who is also a wealthy and well-connected tribal member.  Although Precious doesn't want to take on the case, the official and Mma Makutsi bully her into it.  While she's away on the case, Mma Makutsi proves to have even more talents than anyone could have expected from either her degree or her experience.  In the process, she brings in a major case which she solves on her own involving four potential beauty contest winners.<br />In the first half of the book, the distress that Precious and Mr  J.L.B. Matekoni are experiencing is so palpable that I found myself feeling more and more upset as I read the story.  Seldom does &quot;light&quot; fiction affect me that way.  I can only ascribe the intensity of my reactions to the quality of the writing and the exceptional care with which the characters have been developed into people for whom anyone would feel great sympathy and empathy.  The book ends up leaving some mysteries unsolved, and I found myself wishing that I had a copy of the next book with me so that I could read what happened right away.<br />As I finished the story, I found myself wondering more about Botswana and why people love it there so much.  I recently began working with a businessman in Botswana, and he has promised to help me understand more about that intriguing country.  I look forward to being his student in this, as I have enjoyed being a reader of these fine novels.h to do.

0553293397|4.0|THE NAKED SUN is a witty little novel that is unmistakably a product of Isaac Asimov.  Not just because of the ubiquitous robots, but because of the familiar themes that Asimov explored over the course of his decades-long career.  On the surface, the novel is a science-fiction mystery story told in the author's usual enjoyable style.  But by the time I reached the end of the book, I realized that Asimov had been doing something a little cleverer than his normal runaround, and upon reaching the conclusion, I immediately flipped back and started revisiting some of the earlier scenes to catch what I had missed the first time around.<br />THE NAKED SUN starts up where THE CAVES OF STEEL left off, although you certainly do not need to have read the earlier book to enjoy this one.  Earthman Detective Elijah Baley is once again teamed up with R. (for Robot) Daneel Olivaw to solve an unexplained murder.  The gimmick this time is that the homicide occurred on one of the mysterious Outer Worlds, and Baley must not only act as policeman, but as an unofficial spy for an Earth government curious as to what the culture is like on those advanced, robot-dependent planets.<br />The mystery is rather clever, although I did figure out what the murder weapon must have been before Baley did.  As usual with Asimov's mysteries, I found myself enjoying the investigation more than the occasional plot logic that's thrown to the audience.  In the case of this book, the storyline has some solid twists and turns, the only real flaw being that the cast of characters is so small that one could just pick a suspect at random to have a pretty good shot of correctly identifying the killer.<br />The real star of this story is the universe that Asimov builds.  The Earth is still the lagging, suspicious and enclosed world of THE CAVES OF STEEL, but now we turn our attention out to one of the colony worlds, Solaria.  I could tell that Asimov was having a blast creating this society, giving us all kinds of details such as this planet's frosty relationship with Earth, its delicate relationship with other Outer Worlds, its population levels, its staggeringly high ratio of robots to people, etc.  But he has even more fun giving birth to the inhabitants.  He has them still as recognizable humans, but from an extremely skewed perspective.  For most of the book, it's the story of these strange people and their odd customs that overpowers what is currently going on in the murder investigation.  This definitely makes for an interesting read, as once we get to the end, we find that the detective portions were only secondary to the real point of the book.<br />Often Asimov would insert little bits of social commentary into his fictions, with varying levels of success.  And indeed, the summation at the end, where Baley lets the cat out of the bag and tells us what the novel has been exploring, is a little on the clumsy side.  But the real triumph is how the author quietly and cunningly led us down the garden path to the end.   When I opened the book to page one and found Elijah Baley nervously flying into a Washington, DC airport (by sheer coincidence I was making the same approach, albeit I started my journey in a different city than Baley had) and wishing to once again be safe indoors, I chucked to myself, recalling passages from Asimov's autobiography that discussed his legendary fear of flying and his mild claustrophilia.  While reading all this stuff about people who hate flying, people who have an unnatural fear of face-to-face meetings, and people who yearn for enclosed spaces, I assumed that Asimov was doing nothing more than his usual shtick of inserting his own neuroses into his fictions (there's nothing wrong with this; it can make for very interesting reading, and it's something I particularly enjoy from Asimov).  And with that assumption in place, I didn't pay much mind to what the author was actually setting up beneath the surface.  So when the end of the novel rolled around and it was suddenly revealed what he had been up to this whole time, I was very pleasantly surprised.<br />I like pulpy books that work on more than one level, and THE NAKED SUN gives us a very clever look at human fears while also providing an entertaining murder mystery.  No, the characters aren't terribly deep, but the plot is a fun one and the extra bit of world building that Asimov engages in raises this book up.  I like to read Asimov novels while traveling, because I find them to be a nice relaxing way to pass a few hours.  Anytime the good doctor can provide me with something even better and smarter than his usual high standard of amusing, whimsical adventures, I'm a very happy camper indeed.
B0001ADB8C|3.0|Why must the music industry continually attempt to rip-off the fans??<br />This box set is an ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF!<br />Thankfully,each album IS available seperately. As for the DVD,read below.<br />The good news is some of the discs include new/original art concepts. &quot;Somewhere In England&quot; now uses the original photo collage cover. &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; uses an alternate back cover photo.<br />The &quot;bonus&quot; tracks,on each CD,are nothing more than DEMOS. What happened to the known unreleased songs? Such as &quot;Flying Time&quot;,&quot;Lay His Head&quot; &amp; &quot;Sat Singing&quot;? Where are &quot;Cockamamie Business&quot;,&quot;Poor Little Girl&quot;,and &quot;Cheer Down&quot; from the &quot;Best of<BR>Dark Horse&quot; album? Where is &quot;I Don't Want To Do It&quot; or &quot;The Pirate Song&quot; ? What about some of the music from &quot;Time Bandits&quot;?<br />As for the DVD it too is INCOMPLETE. Spending more time on &quot;Live In Japan&quot;,and being sure to include BOTH versions of &quot;Got My Mind Set On You&quot;...instead of including &quot;True Love&quot;,&quot;Blow Away&quot;,&quot;All Those Years Ago&quot;,and &quot;Dream Away&quot;.Why not just release a Harrison Music Video DVD? ( and include the pre-Dark Horse videos too! )<br />I love George's music,particularly &quot;33 &amp; a 1/3&quot;,but this set leaves a lot to be desired,especially considering the cost! Buy the discs individually,at your leisure,and give the karmic finger to those who wish to rip you off!

But once I saw the trailer, I knew that this last title of the series will not live up to the previous two.<BR>I must admit that when I watch it, I really enjoyed myself. The actions are superb. But not worth for a repeat viewing. So buy the DVD only if you really like complete your Terminator collections or have spare money to spend.
B000089CJI|2.0|First off this is not a great album by any means. Yes, greatly produced but it seems WAY to fake. I absolutley hate when albums are controlled by the engineers who make it sound as if zombies are playing music. Any body can have this sound with a great engineer and little experience with insturments(BAND). The electronic beats with indie music has been done. Please try the \\"ANNIVERSARY\\" for more heart felt lyrics and just plain better electro-pop. The Anniversary has the most heart felt lyrics that are genious.<BR>Just cause wherer i live the postal service is number 1 on the radio deosn't mean its good music. You guys are like corporate zombies walking in straight lines following one another. WAKE UP get some good music.<br />Who is more foolish? The fool or the fool who follows?
B000002B7U|4.0|Why Ozzy refuses to Re-release this record, I don't know, it's not that bad. I already had \\"Bark at the Moon\\" when I got \\"The Ultimate Sin,\\" and people had said that \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" was worse than BATM. I found that very hard to believe, and now that I've heard \\"The Ultimate Sin,\\" I can definitely say it's the better of the two with Jake E. Lee on guitar, the other, obviously being BATM. The best songs are \\"Killer of Giants,\\" \\"Shot in the Dark,\\" \\"Thank God for the bomb,\\" and \\"Secret Loser.\\" The songs that suck are \\"Never know why,\\" \\"Lightning Strikes,\\" and the title song, but it's not that bad. How does Ozzy not like \\"Shot in the Dark?\\"
0553573403|5.0|Let me begin by saying that A Game of Thrones is the best fantasy book to every grace the genre and A Song of Ice and Fire is the best fantasy series ever, easily surpassing Lord of the Rings. What makes this series so good is that Martin combines fantastic world-building with grity realism of both plot and human nature. This is not a simple tale of sword and socery, and it doesn't have the heroic flare like the story of Frodo. It is an incredible tapestry of jealousy and hatred, incest and murder, knights and ladies, kings and soldiers. And instead of focusing on seperation of good and evil like many fantasy series, there are no black and white characters, only grays. Each character is so fully developed, it pulls you into their world never let you go. The dialouges are some of the best ever as well as the usage of the English language.<br />By the time you finish this book, you will realize how realistic it is. In this book, there are no exaggerations. There are no magical ring that corrupts you, no evil wizards, no ... characters created just to force the meaning of evil upon you. None of that exists. The only evil is the human heart. The malice of it, and its the will to suceed no matter what. And if you think good guys win in real life, Martin brings you back to the terrifying reality that victory goes to those who is sly, cunning, and sometimes those that possesses the coldest of hearts. Honesty and trust does not always brings you happiness, but sometimes acts as your grim reaper. This is a direct parallel to world we live in. Every teenager should read this book. Through it, they will see what the real world is like, especially in a age where kids uses taunts and punches more than their brain.<br />A masterpiece for the ages.

This book is AWFUL.<br />it's not that albom's writing is bad, it's quite the oppisite, he is, in fact, a fab. writer. And it isn't Albom's subjest matter, becuse hearing of this novel made me want to read it and even after finishing it, i was impressed by the story line. It's simply his road in doing so.<br />i just didn't feel that i could get into this book like i have with others, perhaps it was just me (as it seems from the rest of these reviews) but the same thing seemed to happen every chapter. Mitch goes to Morrie's on Tues. Morrie teaches a life lesson. Mitch only half gets it. Mitch goes away. Mitch ponders. Mitch realizes Morrie is right. Mitch goes to Morrie's on the next Tues. where the vicously mundane cycle begins again.<br />I would not however giving up on Albom entirely. In fact one of the best books i've ever read is &quot;the five people you meet in heaven&quot;. a beautifly written and well orginized, (plus it has a little variety!!) novel, i trongly recoment you read it instead
B0000DZTIW|3.0|The thing that I've always loved about Hans Zimmer is that each soundtrack has been different to the last which is why I own 4 of his works (Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Hannibal, and The Thin Red Line) each ranging from electric rock elements to small dark arrangements to full-on orchestral triumphs! But the probelm I had with THE LAST SAMURAI is that it sounds an awful lot like his THE THIN RED LINE soundtrack - but not as bold. Sure we've got the occasional taiko drums and a lot of japanese flutes, but he could have gone so much more Japanese in my opinion.<br />The major theme featured in the soundtrack is nice, but after hearing it's 5th variation during one listening I was really unimpressed. Instead of a collection of different tracks with different tempos and scope we have a rather flat piece which should have come from the self-replicating-composers Williams, Horner or Goldsmith(either of them).<br />I consider myself a Hans Zimmer fan, but I've decided to pass on buying this album after listening to it a couple of times. I thouroughly recommend Zimmer's THE THIN RED LINE tho as a substitute though.<br />This album is ideal for those who liked the movies soundtrack and aren't likely to collect an artists other works, but not if you're really into the composers past works. It will dissapoint...
0060254920|4.0|There are quite a few reviews listed that claim that this book glorifies being a snot-nosed brat.  While yes, Max is every parent's nightmare at the beginning, and yes, he gets whisked off to this fantasy land with monsters, being bad is not glorified at all.  Once he's \\"Where the Wild Things are,\\" he uses the tried-and-true parent move of having a stearn staring contest (my mom did this w/ me, so that's why I assume it's a common parent move) w/ the other \\"wilds\\" to prove that he's boss.  Then, as King (parent?), he has to control the wilds, which proves to be too much for Max to handle.  Instead of sticking with them, the wilds that \\"love\\" him, Max leaves so he can go back to the \\"someone that loves him very much.\\"  The point:  After being put in the role of leader and \\"parent,\\" he realizes that even though he's been a total Crap to his mom, she has always been there for him and has never left him, unlike how he left the wilds.  Also, he had to deal first hand with beings that acted the same way he acted towards his mother.  Instead of being able to just leave Max, she has to stay with him (well...she's his mom...she should stay w/ him), and he realizes in the end that he's acted unfairly to his mom and decides to clean up his act.  At least that's what I saw in the story the first time I read it when I was 5, and that's what I continue to see today, 15 years later.
B0000ATU53|3.0|I've wanted to get this CD for ages, and after hearing Black Eyed Peas third single, &quot;Hey Mama&quot;, I was determined to get it. The UK version has two bonus tracks - &quot;Rock My S***&quot; and &quot;What's Goin' Down&quot;.<br />So far, Black Eyed Peas (Will.i.am, Fergie, Taboo, and apl.de.ap) have released three pretty successful songs. &quot;Where Is The Love?&quot; of course catapaulted them to success by using a certain Mr Timberlake. &quot;Shut Up&quot; didn't need the help of any already established celebrity, as &quot;Where Is The Love?&quot; stayed at #1 in the UK charts for 6 or 7 weeks. And &quot;Hey Mama&quot; will no doubt go the same way.<br />But I can't see them go much further than 3 singles. Unless they get around to doing another album quick smart. There are no more potential singles on this. You sit up and take notice when their three singles so far come on. Maybe the first two tracks (&quot;Hands Up&quot;/&quot;Labor Day&quot;) MIGHT become singles, but there isn't much hope for the rest of them.<br />What may also be the problem is that Black Eyed Peas are much more about the performance than listening to the album. They sing live every time, and are great at it - unlike some people in the UK charts at the moment, who mime every chance they get. There is a lot of effort put into the live performances, and also, Fergie comes across a lot clearer in performances. On the album, it sounds like she was as far away from the microphone as possible in the recording studio, while the guys sound really close. This is a waste of good talent, as Fergie can hold a note, better than Mariah or Whitney.<br />I thought originally Black Eyed Peas were going to be a one-hit-wonder, and &quot;Where Is The Love?&quot; does come across as a novelty song. I'll be waiting patiently to see what their next single after &quot;Hey Mama&quot; is. I'll be surprised.
B0001M3QYO|4.0|If you are looking for some good light entertainment, put this film on your list.  The song and dance sequences are peppy and upbeat, the period costumes are a hoot, and all of the stars are clearly having fun.  Julie Andrews, Mary Tyler Moore, Carol Channing, James Fox, John Gavin, and Beatrice Lillie all make the most of a campy/cornball plot.  Jack Soo and Pat Morita, later seen in Barney Miller and Happy Days,respectively, also have fun roles----although you may have to force yourself to turn a blind-eye to the racist portrait of Chinese Americans.<br />The film is a low-key joy, and you owe yourself some chuckles.

B00005T30L|4.0|An underrated yet excellent movie, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is an enticing indie offering from director Terry Zwigoff. Yes, it`s another movie about teenagers, still it`s far from being a useless collection of jokes glued together a la &quot;American Pie&quot; or &quot;Roadtrip&quot;. Instead, this film, inspired by the Daniel Clowes` underground comic, focuses meaningful themes like alienation, consumism, (sub)culture and the first steps into the adult world. <br />Thora Birch plays Enid, a clever, creative yet confused suburban young girl straight out of highschool. She and her friend Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) must face a new and unpredictable future where they have to be on their own and face multiple and relevant choices. They never seemed to really fit in, and for the first time realize that pherhaps they should. But is it worth it? And what`s the price to pay? <br />Zwigoff manages to combine drama and comedy with great effect, delivering a cinematic experience that is satirical and ironic while being poignant and emotional as well. In a way, it`s like MTV`s show &quot;Daria&quot;, but in this movie the results are more deep, intense and relateable. <br />At times, the pacing is a bit slow, still it makes sense since the story focuses some points like the everyday mundane monotony and suburban inertia where nothing interesting or gripping seems to happen. <br />&quot;Ghost World&quot; is also a twisted, witty and original coming-of-age story, focusing the nerds, geeks and losers that are as clever and brilliant as they are ignored and virtually invisible (like ghosts). As a result, they don`t have much of a social life and remain incapable of relating with most of those who surround them. Enid is such a character, and when she dares to try helping someone she ends up being used and hurt. <br />One of the most innovative and surprising independent movies of the last years, &quot;Ghost World&quot; is a little gem worth discovering that gets better with each viewing. Probably most, or at least many people won`t like it much, since this is not a typical, laugh-a-minute and brainless teen movie, but a thought-provoking and genuine cinematic experience. Still, for those who try to get deep into it, it will surely be a memmorable and unique film to watch. <br />Related movies: &quot;Donnie Darko&quot;, &quot;American Splendor&quot;, &quot;SubUrbia&quot;, &quot;The Good Girl&quot;, &quot;Storytelling&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot;, &quot;L.I.E.&quot;, all very good choices as well
B00005O5JV|5.0|Lisa Kushell, as the boutique saleswoman was the best part of the movie. That dress she was wearing was amazing. I cant believe Reese Witherspoons character outsmarted her the way she did. Why was she not in the following movie/
B000000WCX|2.0|Despite a couple of impressive songs (the energetic &quot;Little Wonder&quot; or &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot;), this Bowie attempt at trying drum n` bass/ trip-hop/ electro territory turns out a bit uneven and not too engaging. It`s a competent and listenable effort, still most of the moments here are just curious yet ultimately forgettable experiments. While it`s not downright bad, it ends up being tiresome and far from gripping. It already souds dated at parts, which doesn`t help, although I can see how it was a breath of fresh air when it came out in the mid-nineties.<BR>A decent album, but far from a keeper.
B00005JN1L|4.0|Take Johnny Depp, a movie star with fine acting abilities as well as box office draw.  Then take John Turturro, one of the best actors in Hollywood today.  Put them together in story adapted from a Stephen King novella.  Have the screenplay written and directed by David Koepp of Spider Man and Panic Room fame.  Have a big budget and shoot the exteriors in Canada and the interiors on a set in Los Angeles.  If you like scary movies, this is a winning combination.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is cast as a writer who is living in what he refers to as a cabin but is, in reality, what many people would consider an ideal rustic vacation home.  It has a secret window which looks out over a garden - hence the title.  He's an unhappy man because he's going through a messy divorce.  He sleeps most of the day and finds it difficult to write.  All of the sudden the doorbell rings.  Standing there is John Turturro, dressed in a black suit with a large brimmed black hat.  In a deep southern accent Turtorro accuses Depp of stealing his story. He even leaves his manuscript, which Depp soon realizes is the exact same story that he published several years before.  Turtorro starts to menace Depp.  It's all very frightening, especially since the atmosphere of the story is planned to have the utmost of tension.<br /><br />As the story unfolded I was completely drawn in, but a small part of me was impatient with the outcome.  Knowing this was originally written by Stephen King gave me a hint of the ending.  The plot thickens as the wife, played by Maria Bello and her boyfriend, played by Timothy Hutton, enter the story.  There's one scary moment after the other with no explanation.  There are several acts of violence, which intensify as the story progresses.  But by the ending, however, I wasn't surprised.  It's not a pleasant ending and left me with a rather hollow feeling.<br /><br />This certainly isn't a \\"feel good\\" movie and, even though the conclusion is satisfactory, it wasn't a conclusion I wanted.  But that's Stephen King for you!  Fans of his and of the stars will probably love it.lusion I wanted.  But that's Stephen King for you!  Fans of his and of the stars will probably love it.
0141301104|5.0|I really enjoyed this book when one of my teachers read it to my class, when I was a kid.  It is all about evil witches living among us in secret and trying to get rid of children.  Along with the main plot, about an old woman and her grandson who are on to the witches, there are a lot of good side stories about witches and what they do to kids.  A great book.
B00009TB5G|4.0|This is a good movie and I give it four stars, becuase after reading the books I am a little dissappointed at some of the parts that were left out, but that is understandable. <br />To you people who are saying that this is a terrible movie/book and that Peter Jackson did a terrible job, you probably couldn't do half as well of a job as he did with the films, and if you were asked to write a best seller like this trilogy, you would probably fail miserably.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|After seeing this movie I couldn't figure out what the hype was about. Visually this movie is wonderful. Everything is bright and colorful and so unique that I was constantly gasping saying &quot;look at that!&quot;<BR>Bill Murry Is a treat. It's great to see him in a new movie just being perfectly Bill. <BR>However the plot was so horribly boring I wanted to cry. I was fighting to stay awake just so I could keep watching Bill. If you go and see this movie just don't expect anything wonderful. Bill is the best part of the movie. Too bad 'cause I think it had a lot of potential.
B000002H97|5.0|metallica change because of one,bob rock had changed them and two they probably ran out of ideas.even when its not thrash its still awesome,if you dont like this then i guess your not a metallica fan.metallicas my fav band and they never dissapointed me not ever.the intro starts off with enter sandman which is the BEST track on the album and its a metallica classic,then it goes to sad but true,it maybe slow but its powerful and sluggish i love it almost as much as enter sandman.this album has a lot of classics on here (holier than thou,through the never,wherever i may roam,of wolf and man lots of tracks on here).but the ballad nothing else matters is one of my favs it comforts me and its heartwarming(i can be very sensitive and emotional).so if you like this album and if its one of your favs you probably wont be dissapointed by getting albums after the black album,but if you think this is good and think that thier thrash albums of the 80's are better you'll probably be dissapointed on the albums after black.
B00005JL0I|2.0|Casino Royale isn't a terrible movie; it has its moments, and, truly, has a superb cast.  That much can be said for it.  There are some scenes with Ursula Andress, especially, that are very funny, and the beginning isn't without its humor.  However, in general it is a mess of movie; loosely constructed, making little to no sense, and, what is worst of all, not even all that funny.  I had to fight off sleep to keep consciousness during the movie, something I almost never have to do.  I actually got to the point where I couldn't wait for it to end.  Not the worst film ever made, but save your money.  Rent it if you must.
B000002H2H|5.0|this is almost as good as puppets,i really miss the days when metallica used to write good music.the album starts off with fight fire with fire it acoustic but then it becomes EXTREMLY fast,the title track dude,ride is one of the best songs ever brutal riffs and james screaming on the part &quot;someone help me OH PLEASE GOD HELP ME,they're trying to take it all away,i dont want to die&quot; classic,for whom the bell tolls has a good bass intro by the almighty cliff burton(R.I.P.)and awesome leads too,fade to black is metallicas first ballad its awesome the best track on here, everytime when i feel like i wanna kill myself i listen to this song makes me feel comfortable and better,trapped under ice has nice riffs and i dont know what else to say about this song,escape yeesh least fav on the album but its okay,creeping death dude i loves this a lot it sounds much better when played live,and last but not least the call of ktulu which is metallicas best instrumental.puppets is better than this,but this is another album for you if your startin to become a metallica fan
0767827791|5.0|You know it's good:<br />1.  It's the look on William Holden's face when he first catches a glimpse of Kim Novak coming down the stairs in that pink dress.  (&quot;Madge is the pretty one&quot;--she sure is)<BR>2.  It's the way she shimmies up to him.  Revealing her intentions, she never loses eye contact or says a word.<BR>3.  It's the moment he takes her into his arms to dance close--he gives a little sigh of pleasure.<BR>4.  It's the look on his face when he's dancing--that criptic smile of pleasure and sensuality--all the while knowing that she's totally off limits.<br />and of course the song itself.  This scene in itself makes the movie and with DVD you can play it over and over and over...  Not many dance scenes have stood the test of time.  I loved it.  What can I say--I'm a chick.
B00012QM8G|5.0|I don't know what I can say about this movie. This is one of THE best movies I have ever seen. I would recommend this movie to anybody who is really into World War II, the Holocaust, and/or the actors that were in it, who did an outstanding and amazing job of portraying these real characters. I haven't seen that many World War II movies, except for Saving Private Ryan, which is another masterpiece from the awesome Steven Spielberg, but this movie is the type of movie that you will actually have an understanding of how much of an impact it is for the Jewish community and for the Jews that survived this horrible time in our past. I think this is the best movie that was done by Spielberg, and I would recommend it to anyone, expect for children.
B000002LE6|5.0|A kinda song cycle, Lovesexy is Prince's last great album of his &quot;Purple Reign&quot; period of the mid '80s (84-88)<br />A great album that has so many superb tracks.  Alphabet Street, Anna Stesia, Lovesexy, Positivity, When 2 Are In Love, Dance On, and I can go on an on.<br />The whole album flows very well and I think that's why it was made into 1 track.  It was meant to be heard as a whole.<br />A+

6305971099|2.0|This film was so wrong on many different levels! How did the Myers home become a gothic mansion? What happened to Michael's mask??? It looked absolutely ridiculous, not to mention it doesn't even match the one positioned on the box cover! The supporting characters are dreadful and you pray for their demise, in particular Tina. Oh &amp; did I mention the doof cops named Freddy &amp; Jason? Moan inducing, indeed!
B000002MT0|2.0|Next to Graffiti Bridge, this is my second least favorite Prince album.<br />Still an ok album though.  Very dark sounding, with a little techno feel to a couple of the songs.  Highlights for me are the title track, and suprisingly Papa.  The rest I can take or leave it.<br />B-
B00012FXAE|5.0|This film is always a treat to watch. Whereas the first film was suspenseful and quite serious, this sequel is a wild ride filled with hot action and laughs.<br />From Newt's infamous &quot;They mostly come out at night, mostly&quot; to Bill Paxton's hijinks, there are one-liners to be enjoyed by all. My favorite character just has to be Vasquez! She was such a hoot and I loved the way she pushed all the men around!<br />Oh and lets us not forget Ripley asking Netw about her parents only to be told, &quot;They're dead! OK! Can i go now?&quot; hehehe
B000002LHX|4.0|I agree with another reviewer in that Batman sounds not only rather dated, but also has the feel that it was recorded in a quick amount of time.<br />Don't get me wrong, I do like this album, but I believe with alittle more effort into some of the tracks would make it a full A+ album.<br />I am probably in the minority when I say that my favorite track on here is the hit of the album, Batdance.<br />The only other tracks on here I like are Scandalous, The Future, and Partyman.<br />A--
B00005QIPH|5.0|This album is great. I think I have to give it five stars because I like every song on it! New York City Cops was a great song which had to be taken off the American version of the album and was replaced with When It Started, but I like that song just as much! Some people say the Strokes are over hyped or they just copy off older groups. That is true to a point but I don't see anything wrong with being influenced by great musicians. It's better than imitating the assembly line pop stars that are becoming worse than ever these days. To me the appeal of the Strokes is simple. Their songs have a sort of laid back cool but they're actually catchy, and melodic. I can definitely see that the media and the critics have just decided to like the Strokes for some reason while they reject others who are also very talented, but that doesn't change the fact that the Strokes really make good music. <br />I was initially impressed with Is This It upon first listening to it and I've actually come to love it even more over time. Songs like Hard To Explain and Someday jump out at you at first to get your attention but after repeat listenings, songs like The Modern Age, Barely Legal, and Trying Your Luck, etc. are my favorites. The Strokes know how to make a nice tune with a good beat. That's one thing that made the Beatles so great, although the Strokes are certainly a different style than the Beatles. The album never drags or gets boring. So I highly recommend it.
B000002L68|5.0|Prince released Purple Rain in 1984.  <br />The whole album is classic and one of the best albums of the '80s.<br />No need to go into the songs, they speak for themselves.<br />Yes, there is argument among fans which is Prince's best, but IMO this is his best, most consistant album he's released!<br />A+++
0440236738|3.0|The beginning was a little tough to read. Coben seemed like he was trying to hard to write like a writer instead of tell a good story. The terminology and details seems...forced, a little out of place. After a while he either got into his groove or the pace and plot were exciting enough that I didn't notice his writing and was able to enjoy the story. <BR>The characters seemed familiar, but this story felt more robust than &quot;Tell No One&quot;. I really enjoyed the first because it was an orignial story for me. The second book though, now familiar, felt more complex and full, more complete. I have enjoyed both books for different reasons, and would recommend each, but I think his best work is still to come. <BR>Cobens style just feels like it needs to mature a little. His writing and terminology can be so blatant that it chokes the story and the experience.
B00018D44U|1.0|I know she's the media- and popular culture darling, but this album is so boring and lifeless that it's almost unlistenable.  Jones' vocals are listless and delivered as if she were busy thinking about something else while chewing on a piece of hard candy.  Her pronunciation is so affected that it's disconcerting.  The songs themselves are musically strong, but the lyrics sound as if they were written in 1976 by a high-schooler (i.e., obvious and unsophisticated).  The only highlight of the album for me was Dolly Parton's appearance on one track - it was the only time I felt any emotion behind the singing.
B00003CXRM|4.0|I liked many things about this film.  The stereotypes of Southern culture we've all grown up with were cleverly caricatured...the fat but good-natured politicians, the fat and ill-natured ones, the Ku Klux Klan, chain gangs and their cruelty, the simpleminded and uncultured poor.  Then there is the denatured moonshine on Saturday night, and the good-natured &quot;You-are-my-Sunshines&quot; on Sunday morning.  And that odd Southern combination of careful etiquette with downright meanness (&quot;Well Suh, I'll thank you to get off my porch a'fore I blow you ta Kingdom Come.&quot;) Southern populism with all its racial contradictions- low culture brought to a high art. <BR> <BR>And let's not forget the music!  &quot;Land sakes alive... them Soggybottom Boys shore can sing&quot;!   All of this is tied together in a most appealing way with Homer's Oddyssey- the blind oracle on the railroad tracks, the Sirens singing in the river...  This movie is really different!  Nostalgia for the Old South brought back full force, leaving you feeling guilty for liking it, just the same. <br />Senryu
B000060P79|5.0|This CD is the best CD in the world.  You can listen to it over and over, yet it never gets old.  The songs are catchy and have good meanings.  Simple Plan is very talented and can write awesome songs.  It all depends on what kind of music you like.  If you like good music like Blink 182 and Good Charlotte then you should like this.  Simple Plan is the best band in the world and I totally recommend you buy this CD!! Simple Plan is the sweetest band in the world and they deserve to be known as the best.

B00009TB5G|2.0|Peter Jackson should be ashamed of himself<br />for what he's done to a piece of classic<br />fantasy literature. Characters, especially<br />Gimli, are altered for comic relief. Scenes<br />are so changed that they're barely<br />recognizable. This was terrible. I highly<br />suggest buying the book and skipping this<br />dreck.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|What an amazing film! All I can say to those who think nothing happens in &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is that a lot happens - you apparently just don't see it. It's depressing to those of us who get sick of Hollywood formula and sterility that when a director actually has the vision and the courage to break the mould, certain viewers - who ought to be MOST tired of the formula - get so riled up. <br />Looking at those who give it one star, and not counting the jealous script-writing wannabes, I am amazed by how unable they are to realise that others might have entirely legitimate reasons for loving it. As some have pointed out, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is to some degree a reworking of the same themes in &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;.  If you're the kind of person for whom &quot;Titanic&quot; or &quot;The Terminator&quot; is the apotheosis of cinema don't waste your time. This isn't for you. Neither was &quot;Brief Encounter&quot;. The fact that it's for a different type of movie-goer does not mean that those different types of movie-goers have scurrilous motives.<br />Maybe critics and more informed viewers love this film because critics see more movies than you and realise how repetitious and inane most of them are. Maybe they love it because they better appreciate Coppola's subtlety and maturity, and because they can see how much of the characters' depth in this film is so masterfully conveyed - without putting it into words - by Murray and Johansson. I've seen &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; three times. It gets better with every viewing. I'll probably watch it again this weekend.<br />The ire that it apparently raises in those who don't get it reminds me exactly of the anger some people expressed towards another great film: &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;. It's hard in the Hollywood industry for this kind of subtle film to be made, whether your name is Coppola or not. We should thank God that some operate against the mindless pap many in the audience someprefer and take a chance. And it's amusing to see some throwing out the names of a few &quot;art&quot; films to establish their credentials for trashing this one. I've seen every &quot;art&quot; film mentioned here, and Coppola's stands well among them. Those who really love art movies should be more open to alternative visions. I can appreciate Tarantino, even if I don't love him.<br />Anyhow, the bottom line is the film was cheap to make (much cheaper than the horrendous &quot;Titanic&quot;), has done very well financially, and has touched a chord in a great many people. It's a huge success. I hope it gives Sofia Coppola the strength to make more films like this, and her excellent &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;. To those who say anyone could make a film like this, I say &quot;Go ahead&quot;. I'll pay to see yours too, if it is really in this class. <br />To the broader-minded, don't miss &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. <br />When something arouses such strong divided feelings, whether it's movies or sushi, it's always best to try it for yourself. It's the only way you'll ever know if, as in the case of this film, it can speak to your soul.
0385504209|1.0|Tolstoy, Doestoevsky, Dumas, Dickens and Brown?  Give me a break! This forgettable piece of pulp has nothing in common with the works of those great writers.  I could hardly bring myself to form a sentence (incomplete though it is) that included those five names.<br />For those who defend the DVC because it is fiction after all, I have to say that at least half of my book club, bought the thing hook line and sinker and they are intelligent people.<br /><br />Brown is a hack and worse he is dishonest.  Where is this guy anyway?  Why doesn't he emerge from his sanctuary and answer some of his critics regarding his declared &quot;facts&quot; and research.  Better for sales to keep the mystique alive, I suppose.<br />Next month my bookclub selection is going to be &quot;Crime and Punishment.&quot;  The richness of Doestoevsky should, if not clean the groups collective palate, at least smother the nasty taste left by Brown's foul effort.
B00005ATQD|5.0|The following is an outline of my reading of Eyes Wide Shut.<br />I don't know if I'd say that Eyes Wide Shut takes place in a dream state, but rather that it blurs the line between reality and projection (in the Freudian sense).  Its not so much that the events in the film are not actually happening, but that Kubrick has put images on film that have to be read as questionable with regard to their true \\"reality\\" as they are skewed through the POV of Bill (and on a lesser scale, Alice) to extreme extents throughout.<br />Granted its Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, but does everyone that each character meets truly want to sleep with them at first glance?  Or instead, are these just the projections of each character's own narcissism onto the people they come across?  Or at the end of the day is it a little of both?  For Alice, it appears to be a type of projection that she ultimately finds disgust with.  She believes that both the man at the party and the man in her flashback want to sleep with her because deep down inside she wants to sleep with them too.  Again maybe they did (more likely in the case of the man at the party) and again maybe they didn't (more likely in the case of the man in her story).  Then there is her reaction to her dream that parallels Bill's experience.  At the end of the day (while she still may want to do it) she seems disgusted by such events/desires/projections, but at the same time doesn't hide the fact as much as Bill that such desires exist.  <br />In the case of Bill, the events/desires/projections dive into territory that is far more taboo (prostitutes, underage girls, orgies, potential lovers already in a relationship, etc., etc.), and while \\"like\\" may be too strong of a word, I think its clear that on at least some level he is excited by such possibilities (as well as much more secretive about them).  The orgy scares Bill too, but for much more different reasons than it does Alice.  The orgy and the aftermath of it are especially important, in that it builds upon this groundwork of projection as a central theme within the film in a different area.  Is the prostitute really killed, are people really after him and the Piano player, or is there a strong chance that it too is mostly just in his head?  Does Alice really suspect anything sexual just because she found a mask, does Bill just assume that she assumes something sexual because she found the mask, or maybe the mask isn't even really there, but rather just Bill's own projection that he thinks she knows something's up?<br />At the same time, Kubrick doesn't seem to be simply diving into this territory for kicks and giggles, but he also uses it to honor the institution of marriage.  From his POV, marriage protects each partner from the taboos of/releated to sex that can be read as \\"dangers;\\" STDs, drugs, prostitution, ruining families (both your own and your lover's), pedophile, etc., etc.  Given Kubrick's detached personality, yet extreme closeness to his family I think its clear to see where he was coming  from and why he decided to make this film.  Furthermore, in going back to the beginning, in addition to protecting one another from these outside dangers, it is also the institution of marriage that helps protect each partner from the inside dangers of their own egos by keeping them in check as a result of the various sacrifices that are made in marriage (as well as in any relationship in general).  Its not so much these statements themselves that are unique, (its basically just Psychoanalysis 101), but that Kubrick is able to present such statements through a much more interesting and powerful process; a process that is largely visual, and through a script that doesn't really directly deal with such subjects at face value.  <br />Finally, I think this is Kubrick's most emotional film of his career.  While I love many of his films, I don't think there's much of a question that he's very detached from most of the commentary he makes in them.I think its a different case here.  There is still that detachment, but I think his own emotion creeps out of that detachment as well.  Whether or not you agree/like what the film has to say, the more you experience it, the more you can appreciate just how much it likely meant to him.<br />For Dorothy the Rainbow is all and her head.  I think the same goes for Bill, Alice and Stanley. <br />****, (10/10)
0792162803|5.0|Omygod.  Easily one of the funniest movies ever made.  Molly Shannon of course can make the dictionary hilarious.  Mary Catherine Ghallager (MKG) is your &quot;average&quot; teen dreaming of the perfect kiss and becoming a superstar. Not as hokey as it sounds.  This movie is hilarious and is all out fun.  The skirt blowing scene at the beginning nearly made me pee my pants.  The whole movie is filled with either all out laughs or subtle little moments that you catch after watching it a couple of times.  The ridiculousness of MKG is very endearing and may actually hit a little close to home as you remember you teenage years--if you're like me you try and try to block them out!!<BR>Great, fun movie.
B0000584V3|4.0|This thing has my second favorite Opeth song of all time on it, Leper Affinity.  It is my third favorite Opeth album (to MAYH and Deliverance) as it is a perfect viewing point to some of their heaviest stuff and some of their lightest stuff.  Truly a piece of work.  An opeth fan can't go without this thing.  It has a little more variety than most of their other albums, which shows.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I like this band. Jack White's voice reminds me of Led Zeppelin's Robert Plant. A couple of songs sound sort of like just a bunch of noise, but the majority of it is excellent. The straight up rock'n'roll reminds me a lot of the old AC/DC stuff. And Jack White knows how to play blues, I LOVE &quot;ball and biscuit&quot;. Now I want the album with their version of Son House's &quot;Death Letter&quot;!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney definitley improves on her second effort, more catchy tunes, but over-oooozed with ballads, Very cool though. Songs like &quot;Oops!&quot;,&quot;Lucky&quot;,&quot;Dont let me be the...&quot;,&quot;One Kiss From You&quot;, And &quot;STRONGER&quot;!! AND &quot;Dont go knokin' on my door&quot;, and &quot;[I cant get no] Satisfaction&quot; Proves this isnt a cheese-fest! This album rocks and Britney rocks Isnt as good as some of her works down the road but it is definitley a highlight, I mean Who DOSENT know the song &quot;Oops! I did It Again!&quot; This is a highlight of her career, though I think &quot;Toxic&quot; Is getting more attention!. I truly think this is a vaaast improvement on her first, filled with cheesy ballads and corny dance tunes. I reccomend this to any Brits fan, though I think its worth 3 and 1/2 stars, 4 is OK though. Peace Out!

0156027321|5.0|In \\"Life of Pi\\", Yann Martel illustrates a truly amazing existence of an amazing person. In this unique and captivating story, the boy Pi Patel grows with a different view on many things than the average person, he experiments with religion and lifestyles, and ultimately decides he enjoys ALL of them, and thus becomes a practicing Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. The passionate Pi is easy to fall in love with, to pity, to sympathize with. Whose father beside Pi's takes him into a tiger's cage to teach him a lesson? <BR>As Pi protests the one-sided minds of those around him in favor of an open, free existence, I came to admire Pi, and his will to accomplish his goals and put everyone at peace with his decisions, even his competitive and boyish older brother, Ravi. When Pi's old life is suddenly ripped away, it touches the reader (me) so deeply that all of my own horrors seem insignificant in the face of such a tragedy. The extremity of the situation is what really captivated me. It seemed that life could not be any worse for that poor boy, and the fact that this story is based on a true one, really amazed me. The end of the book really lent itself to present-day situations, where nobody trusts each other, and really made the book that much more believable in my eyes. <BR>Although reading about religion was, at first, daunting to me, I was swallowed up by this wonderful novel, and enjoyed it more than I have enjoyed any book in a long time. Yann Martel's writing is colorful and bright, and the characters and setting really seem to come alive as you read, transporting you into a land of tigers, shipwrecks, zoos, and ultimately, a boy with a truly uncanny existence.

B0001ADAVK|4.0|Julia Roberts can do no wrong in my book.  In this movie, it is not Julia who does wrong, but the writers and director.<br />The subject matter is not presented in a whole manner.  It is cut up and choppy at best.  You do get the idea of what is going on and supposed to be happening.  But you never get the fight and the gusto that should be associated with the events.  Julia and everyone elses acting is supberb.  The acting is not whats in question, it is the material the are presented with.<br />Although I did enjoy the movie, I still felt a little needy in the end.  It is like I ate a big huge dinner but still was hungry afterwards.  Nothing in the movie really fullfilled my wants and needs.  Upon watching the movie once more with a friend, I was left wanting even more.  Even after the second time around, instead of seeing more in the movie, I saw even less.  Almost every time a situation was presented which would require some fight or passion, it evaporated into nothing.  Julias character never really fought for what she believed and wanted.  The girls characters seemed to change for no apparent reason.  It is as if they knew that they needed to go from a to z but they just skipped over all the other letters to get there.<br />Don't get me wrong, I did like the movie, I just did not love it.  I did love Julia, just not how her character worked through everything.  All in all, it was just very forgettable in the end.

B00005JN1L|3.0|I was really hoping that this movie was going to be good.  I really wanted this movie to be good.  Maybe I just set my standards too high.  I mean sure Johnny Depp is in the movie, (and carried the whole movie, again) but how many horror movies like these are really good?  This movie makes one less.<br />This movie had a ton of flaws.  I can't really tell what they are without ruining the \\"surprise\\" ending.  Just take my word that there were many flaws.  SPOILER ALERT:  The ending was very similar to Idenity and I really do not like those endings.  Maybe because I can't understand how it is all possible, if you've seen Identity you know what I'm talking about.<BR>  <BR>The movie moved very slowly and the thing that I was most disappointed in was the fact that the movie just wasn't scary at all.  I was laughing at Depp's antics more than I was feeling frightened at plot developments.  <br />There were a few things that I liked.  I like the way the movie ended, not the surprise ending, but the way the story ended.  Mainly because it is something that you rarely see in movies.  Also Depp was very entertaining.  I would give this movie 2 1/2 stars, but I like Johnny Depp so I will give it three.

B0000CDL93|5.0|I'm not sure if people remember just how groundbreaking the editing on this film really was back in '91, but this is an enthralling 3.5 hour overview of the major questions that D.A. Jim Garrison raised about the Kennedy Assassination in his book &quot;On The Trail of the Assassins.&quot;  This film is a tour-de-force by Oliver Stone, and was very controversial for mixing new footage with real archived film clips in a way that many felt would only mislead the uninformed.  They have a point - some details of the arguments here don't hold up to careful scrutiny (truly interested persons should check out other sources, such as Gerald Posner's &quot;Case Closed&quot;) but the amazing thing about this film is that in just a few hours, it gives an amazingly rich &quot;crash course&quot; in the controversies surrounding the assassination investigation.  It successfully conveys Garrison's point of view as a well-intentioned professional who descends from a normal sense of early-60s civic pride into a multi-year journey of doubt about U.S. democracy, and anxiety regarding social changes.  The Cold War, Cuban Missile Crisis and Vietnam, political unrest and assassinations of the 60s...  This is a truly impressive film at relating one man's loss of civic faith, even if you disagree completely with the premises it explores.  It is loaded with stars and cameo appearances.  It can be enjoyed (or studied) again and again.  Particularly notable on the DVD is an interview with Fletcher Prouty, the real version of the film's &quot;Mr. X&quot; that encouraged and guided Garrison's suspicions.  Gary Oldman gives a completely knockout performance as Lee Harvey Oswald, and in my opinion this film also contains the best performance I've seen from Kevin Costner!  Surely only its controversy kept this from Best Picture Oscar possibilities.  What an amazing piece of filmmaking!  And the entire film is contained on one disc, too!
B0001US8EO|5.0|This is by far the number one picture of Wyatt Earp ever made. It deals with his entire life and not just what he is most famous for. The attention to detail is spectacular! His history, as is that of his family, puts a real spin on the name Earp. It shows why he became the man he was and where that fearlessness came from. The score to the film is some of Howard's best work. It is energetic and fun when it should be and dramatic and moving when it has to be. A definite plus.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Even though Steven Spielberg had made some of the most successful -- and profitable -- films in movie history (E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial, Jaws, the Indiana Jones series), he was always perceived as a master craftsman but never as a \\"serious\\" director capable of making a grown-up film.  This is an odd perception, considering that in addition to such crowd-pleasers as Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T. (along with the plethora of projects he has been involved with as executive producer -- Who Framed Roger Rabbit? and the Back to the Future trilogy), Spielberg had directed such serious fare as 1985's The Color Purple and 1987's Empire of the Sun, which deal with such weighty topics as race and the effect of war on children.<br />One film, released in late 1993 -- the same year that Jurassic Park set worldwide box office records -- changed that perception forever: Schindler's List.<br />Based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, a German philanderer, member of the Nazi Party, and war profiteer whose desire to make money from Hitler's European war slowly but irrevocably morphed into a desire to save over a thousand of his Jewish labor force from the Nazis' genocidal \\"Final Solution,\\"  Schindler's List is a powerfully moving film.  It not only never flinches from the inhumanity of Hitler's willing executioners -- there are all sorts of terrible things going on in here, including torture, manhunts, mass executions, and random acts of cruelty -- but it also touches on the central belief felt by Spielberg himself that decency and righteousness can triumph over even the most implacable tyranny and hatred.<br />Working from Steven Zaillian's adaptation of the fact-based novel by Thomas Kenneally, Spielberg chose to film Schindler's List in black and white because most of the documentaries, records and photographs he had seen were in black and white.  As a result, whenever he does use color, especially in the key \\"Special Aktion\\" sequences where Schindler (Star Wars: Episode I's Liam Neeson) catches a glimpse of a single scarlet-clad girl as the Jews of the Krakow Ghetto are ruthlessly rounded up by SS troops.  Spielberg draws the audience's -- and Schindler's -- attention on this single little girl by inserting the coat's red color into the otherwise stark shades of gray, black and white that dominate the film (which is the most expensive black and white movie made, displacing Darryl F. Zanuck's 1962 war classic The Longest Day).<br />Spielberg also chose to shoot Schindler's List on location in Krakow, Poland, where most of the movie takes place, painstakingly recreating the look and atmosphere of the period. A full scale set of Plaszow Labor Camp was built near the site of the real one from existing maps and blueprints, and a few scenes were filmed outside the infamous Auschwitz death camp.<br />Neeson's top notch performance is matched by those of Ralph Fiennes (SS Commandant Amon Goeth), Ben Kingsley (Itzhak Stern), and Caroline Goodall (as Schindler's long-suffering wife Emile), as well as Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz.  Fiennes in particular is outstanding as the homicidal and capricious SS commandant of the Plaszow labor camp, who thought nothing of picking up a rifle and using unwitting and unfortunate inmates for morning target practice.<br />Schindler's List won popular and critical acclaim, winning seven Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Music (by long-time collaborator John Williams), Screenplay, Cinematography, Editing, and Art Direction.  It is not only a fine example of filmmaking at its best, but it also serves as a memorial to the six million victims of the Holocaust, as well as a tribute to a flawed but righteous man who gave up his fortune and risked his life to save a handful of his fellow human beings from history's greatest criminal act.<br />The DVD presents Spielberg's 196 minute masterpiece on one double-sided disc in a digitally enhanced widescreen picture and 5.1 digital sound.  The audio and video content are excellent, although fans of extra features may bemoan the lack of \\"the making of\\" behind-the-scenes featurettes present in other Spielberg-directed movies on DVD.  Instead, there are the dicumentaries \\"Voices From the List\\" and \\"The Shoah Foundation Story.\\"<br /> Nevertheless, the recently-released Universal Studios Home Video DVD is a worthy addition to any serious film lover's collection.d video content are excellent, although fans of extra features may bemoan the lack of \\"the making of\\" behind-the-scenes featurettes present in other Spielberg-directed movies on DVD.

0060730552|5.0|Simpson brings the reader into the depths of despair with him, and then slowly, brings them back from the brink of death.  His story and writing are superb and the book reads very quickly.  Even though you know he survived the ordeal, every fall leaves the reader with a sense of dread and anticipation for what will happen next.  Great story.  Read it.<br />Update:  I saw the documentary that they made from this book.  I am even more amazed after seeing the actual terrain that Joe is still with us.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Normally I would run screaming in the other direction when I hear the word 'Britney', but some of the songs on this CD actually aren't all bad - as long as you're not look for deep, meaningful lyrics. (And BTW people saying what a great song-writer she is - this is the best she can do with the help of professional lyricists?!? Good God!) The single 'Toxic' has surprised some people. Everyone I knew had no idea who it was until I told them (some guy must be getting really rich from voice-enhancers). However, some catchy songs are Showdown, I Got That (Boom Boom), Outrageous, Touch of my Hand, Breathe on Me, and of course Toxic. I don't know if I would buy this CD for those songs alone - but hey, if there's a sale, why not? Just keep it your dirty little secret and stash it in your closet when people come over.
B000096FUD|3.0|Terry Gilliam, the dreamer. Now this director is the one to look up to. he fights, struggles, and maintains his vision.<BR>whether you get him or not, this guy is a character. and this dvd goes head on with that very man.<BR>this particular dvd, would normally be considered the extra discs for a feature film. but since the film fell through, for the time being, we are presented with the idea of Gilliam's vision and promise of Don Quixote. which is a true journey to take. it is a true 'documentry' and has a bit more just so it can stand on it's own. whether your an aspiring filmmaker or a curious other party, this piece is truly depressing, and displays inner compilations of the set up system that is big budget production.
B0000029DD|5.0|I was so happy to see that Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot; is the number 14 seller on Amazon right now...it's even above Outkast!  It made me feel like after almost 10 years, maybe Jeff Buckley is starting to get a little of the recognition he deserves.  This album is perfect...I consider it to be one of the top 10 greatest albums ever.  His voice, guitar playing, harmony and songwriting bring such a feeling of hope and heartbreak to everyone.  This album is a must for everyone.  It's unexplainable, and impossible to understand without listening for yourself.
B00005JLYW|1.0|This movie was by far one of the worst movies I have even seen in a movie theater (second only to He Got Game and Cabin Fever).  I know, I know, this movie isn't meant to be realistic or have a riviting plot...but COME ON!<br />The plot was atricious, the dialog was cliched and pathetic, the acting was horrible, and it was obvious the director had made his money directing music videos.  What the hell is McG anyway?  <br />I admit, I didn't go into this movie with high expectations, but I was still hugely disappointed.  I liked the first movie because of Bill Murray (who was inadequately replaced with Bernie Mac) and the action scenes, which I thought was very well choriographed.  The action scenes in this movie however were very (and I'm talking VERY) unrealistic, overdone, and copied from other movies.  I don't look for realism in action movies, but this was just so over the top I couldn't help it.  <br />The other thing that made me mad about this movie was I couldn't get over the sense that the makers of the movie were targeting the male audience, and suckering them into paying to watch a terrible movie just to see scantily clad women.  There are many GOOD movies that I can watch for that and still enjoy the movie.  Bottom line, if a crappy movie has pretty girls in it, it's still a crappy movie.<br />Do not waste your time with this movie.  If you just want to see the girls, see the first one.  If you want to actually see a good action movie, there are tons out there that are a lot better than this.

0670824399|5.0|Matilda<BR>By: Roald Dahl<BR>Reviewed by: J. Moon<BR>Period 1<br /> This book is about a young little girl name Matilda. She is very smart but the rest of her family was not as brilliant as she is. By the time she was four she had read all of the famous novels. For example she read novels from Charles Dickens. When she entered kindergarten, she met a very nice teacher by the name of Miss Honey. Her kindergarten teacher was nice but the head principal was very cruel. Her name was Miss Trunchbull. By the first day Miss Honey met Matilda, she knew that Matilda should have been in an upper class. Matilda was very smart. She was a genius. Then Matilda found a special power. She was able to move objects with her eyes. As the months went by, Matilda got to know more and more about Miss Honey. She found out that the Trunchbull and Miss Honey were related. Then to get back all of the things the Trunchbull took from Miss Honey, she used her powers to get them back for her. The Trunchbull left the school and never came back. <br /> I enjoyed reading this book a lot. It had a lot of funny moments and thrilling moments. It is a fun-filled book. This book is meant for all readers and it is very enjoyable. There were some moments but to help but ask yourself  what is going to happen next. I think if everyone reads it <br /> My favorite part of the book was the part when Matilda went to the Trunchbull's house to get back all of the things Miss Honey owned. I thought it was very clever of her to think of such a thing to do. You could just imagine a small little girl moving things around with the power of her eyes. This part is very enjoyable to read.
B000070IXT|5.0|Since Night of the Living Dead never gave a real explanation for the return of the zombies Resident Evil would make a good prequel. At least that's how I have it set up in my collection.
B0000TG9E2|5.0|Our family purchased the 2004 2 disk version.  This is the first time the bonus material on Disk 2 gets played way more than the movie in our house.  The bonus disk contains the entire first Walt Disney televised special.  It was aired Christmas Day 1950.  Walt himself brings out the magic mirror and the fun begins.  Wonderful color animation of Mickey and the gang as well as musical clips from classic Disney films.  Pure family entertainment.  My kids love it.  That's good enough for me.

B0000AQVCL|5.0|Finally. An album I like. Even though I'm pretty young, I grew up listening to sixties stuff--the Stones, the Beatles (especially the Beatles), Cream, Hendrix, etc. Somehow modern rock just seems sad in comparison. Until now. These guys seem to have a way of ripping of bands that were good and not making the songs any worse. And so what if they ripped off bands? There are only so many ways a rock song can go, and if the purpose of the group is to return to the days when rock was just fun, then why not take stuff from other bands? Anyway, here's a song by song breakdown:<br />Last Chance: Good opening rocker, screaming vocals, pretty awesome<br />Are You Gonna be my Girl: This song is the reason why everybody bought this album, and it's easily the best on here. Great driving riff<br />Rollover DJ: Fun rock song, not quite as nice as the others, but still a lot of fun<br />Look What You've Done: Slow, weeping ballad that has a very Beatle-y quality. The piano chords are straight from Let It Be and it also has a little sound of Imagine<br />Get What You Need: No, no a remake of the Stones song, but a fast paced rocker with with a slightly harsher sound than some of the other songs on here<br />Move On: The one song on here that really isn't that great. A countryish ballad that really drags on. Skip it<br />Radio Song: The best ballad on here. Great falsetto vocals and nice harmony on the chorus<br />Get Me Outta Here: One of the weaker hard rock songs on here, but still good. It's all good<br />Cold Hard B****: Rough rocker with some, um, interesting lyrics<br />Come Around Again: Not that great. Another slow, dragging-on ballad. Not unlistenable, though<br />Take it or Leave It: Great song--great riff and a driving beat. Great screams by Nic.  The tune and beat on the end of each verse is exactly the same as that on the Beatle's song I've Got a Feeling<br />Lazy Gun: Weird song. Trippy, druggy guitar and wierd groan on intro. Awesomely weird<br />Timothy: Really beautiful ballad apparently about one of the band member's older brother dying

B000084T18|1.0|god to bad 0 wasnt an option.<BR>this cd is garbage, full of crap.<BR>This guy actually thinks he has talent. and people are sucked in by this garbage, and now hes the king of the world. i dont get it. He doesnt have an lyrical talent, and he has synthesizers, I mean what the hell is that? he has a guy pushing buttons for him, and he can't rap for anything (by the way, NO rap takes talent, you can learn to put words together in a fast pace in a day or two, doesnt take too much.) 50 cent, or G-unit shouldnt even be in the music industry, hes NOT a musician. Musicians have music, this guy has synthesized, fake, garbage. I wouldnt call this music. To anyone who would give this crap 5 stars, i would tell them to pick up any instrument and just try to play it, they'll find its not that easy, and stop, because they think 50's got all the talent. I hear people say &quot;..OHHH ILL NEVER BE AS GOOD OR LEGENDARY AS 50 CENT!!&quot;, well you are. I just hate it when they put 50 cent before their own talents, all a bunch of rubbish. To 50 cent lovers, stop, please, dont give this guy more money than he deserves. He doesnt have talent at all. What ever happened to good music anyway, it seemed to have dissapeared in this current age. I mean what happened to the 70's? Led Zeppelin, Clapton, Genesis, Pink Floyd. What happened there? Why can't people make that kind of musci these days? of course times have changed, but music shouldnt just lose talent. the 80's had some decent stuff, the metal era was a little iffy, but when metallica, and slayer came in i started to listen to more of it. In the 90's, here's where we start crapping, Puff Daddy, Notorious B.I.G., all non-talented ego maniacs who are just searching for money. All of them think they're kings, i bet none of them can even read music, thats pretty sad. By the way, if Rap or 50-cent is music, then why don't any rappers have song books so we can learn all of their songs? Well, they don't, cause i hate to break it to you, but the music is fake, synthesizers, and thats about it, maybe a pot and pan or something, but no real instruments. So in other words DONT BUY THIS CD, ITS FULL OF CRAP, AND GARBAGE THAT SHOULD NEVER BE GIVEN CREDIT AS BEING &quot;MUSIC&quot;.

0452282152|2.0|I don't read much literary fiction, mainly because much of it is more about the style with which the novel is written or the allegories or hidden meanings which readers are supposed to detect, cleverly hidden as they are among the novel's usually rather thin storyline. When I read fiction, I read it for the emotional involvement with the characters, and thus my preference is for authors who can invoke emotion with their words.<br />The reviews carried on this book's jacket appear to promise such emotional involvement: we are told that it is `haunting' and `magical', `unbearably poignant' and `steeped in atmosphere'. Maybe it's me, but I didn't see any of that. What I did see was a not-very-well-fleshed-out story about a young Dutch girl with an unusual fascination with colours and imagery, employed to work as a maid in the household of the seventeenth-century painter Vermeer. The household is fraught with traps for the unwary, where no matter what she says Griet may end up in trouble with someone. And yet through all of this, for a character we are meant to believe is uncertain, alarmed, unsure of her status, Griet appears remarkably calm and even capable. She chooses meat better than the household's existing cook; she can even cook better, too! And she can apparently teach Vermeer himself how to give his paintings that extra touch they need to make them unique.<br />But it is the emotions which are the least convincing. Chevalier always tells, rather than shows, when it comes to Griet's emotions. For instance, Griet is subject to the lecherous desires of van Ruijven, and also to his stolen touches. She tells us (very briefly) that she dislikes it, but the few mentions are very dispassionate. Even more emotionless is Griet's courtship with Pieter the butcher. In the accounts of the time they spend together, it appears as if Griet barely tolerates him - and yet this relationship appears to be serious. With Pieter she experiences her first kiss, and this barely ratesa mention; more intimacy is described as if the narrator is a detached, uninterested observer rather than the active participant.<br />In fact, the whole book feels written from a perspective of emotional detachment. I didn't find myself caring about the characters at all, which led to a sense of scepticism about the interest which Vermeer himself is supposed to show in Griet - whether real or just as the potential subject of a painting - and about Griet herself as a credible character. Whether I would have finished the book had I not been reading it to while away a train journey I don't know, but it certainly didn't interest me enough to consider re-reading it, or going to see the film.<br />wmr-uk
B00012QM8G|3.0|what a great movie A1 sound and picture but why ruin it by having to turn it over, for goodness sake this is a DVD not a Laser disc. I can't believe it!
B0000DJZA5|2.0|If you can find it, that is...<BR>It is a bootleg copy of the original aborted &quot;Get Back&quot; album  and blows this pile of crap away.  It also runs about 72 minutes, not 35 like this one.  This album was a big disappointment for me.  The bonus disc (with very little music, just snippets) is better to listen to than the album.<BR>First off, let me say that I love the Beatles music and own all of their studio albums along with over 100 bootleg cds.  There is nothing naked about the mixes here.  All of the excitement and spontenatety (spelling ?) is gone.  I really wish EMI/Apple/Capitol would get off their ass and release the damn movie &quot;Let It Be&quot;.  My 20 year old copy of a copy is nearly worn out and it is the best beatles movie ever because it is not really a movie is the real sense.  It is simply the beatles rehearsing and playing the songs from the original &quot;Let It Be&quot; album.  <BR>I agree with some earlier people in that we need good remasters of the Beatles catalog, and also the MONO versions of Help, Rubber Soul, Revolver, The White Album (PLEASE !!), and STEREO versions of Please Please Me, With The Beatles, A Hard Days Night, and Beatles For Sale.<BR>The differences are very significant.  Of course these are readily available (if you look hard enough) on bootleg cds with sound quality that blows away the released versions, especially on the first four albums, which by the way EMI only relased in mono on cd back in 1987 and they sound flat and terrible.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|&quot;In the Zone&quot; may be the most under-the-radar thing that Britney Spears has done all year. And since it's all about clubbing, partying, and gettin' some, that's a pretty frightening statement. Graduating from vapid teen pop to vapid adult pop, Britney aims for early Madonna's style... and misses.<br />Her songs tend to be either wispy but passable ballads (the self-pleasure ode &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot; or the piano-led &quot;Everytime&quot;) or vapid dance pop, like a collection of Kylie Minogue's rejects. Her duets are particularly embarrassing: &quot;Me Against The Music&quot; is mainly Spears muttering fast against an electronic backdrop, and the Ying Yang Twins make a forgettable appearance in the deeply embarrassing &quot;(I Got That) Boom Boom.&quot;<br />Things go rapidly downhill as the album progresses, with the faux-sexy &quot;Breathe On Me&quot; and &quot;Hook-Up.&quot; The lowest point is the leaden &quot;Outrageous,&quot; which may be the worst-written song of last year (&quot;Outrageous... when I move my body/Outrageous... when I'm at a party/Outrageous... in my sexy jeans&quot;). There's a slight upturn with the weird but catchy &quot;Toxic&quot; and the wispy &quot;Everytime,&quot; but those few listenable tracks are bogged down by all the empty dancepop.<br />There's little that's new about &quot;In the Zone.&quot; Madonna did the poppy electronic beats long ago. But then, she never made an album quite like this -- the electronic synthesizing is so heavy and thick that it feels like muddy water. Spears's voice is the most synthetic part of the album, especially when laced with moans and gasps.<br />Partying sure hasn't done wonders or Britney's voice. She never could sing well to start with, but there's a strain and crack to her vocals that shows up despite the heavy electronic coverups. It's not written anywhere that good vocals are necessary for dancepop, but Spears is only passable (never good) in a few of the songs. She also cowrote several songs, which don't appear to have improved for her contribution. At best, they're mediocre. At worst, they're embarrassingly bad.<br />&quot;In The Zone&quot; was hailed as Spears' clubby, adult album, but it falls wide of the intended mark and sinks into the mire.

B000002U8G|3.0|Meddle has said to be Pink Floyd's best album after the Syd Barrett's time and before the Dark Side of the Moon. Maybe it is because I have heard only Meddle and Atom Heart Mother on this period. Meddle could be a classic album if you found more interesting and terrific songs as One of These Days and epic Echoes on this album. Unfortunaly, rest of the songs are a quite booring ballads as San Tropez and Seamus. These songs are not bad ones but they don't sit very well on this album. Of cource may people like this peaceful and beautiful songs but I am not one of them. Luckily, Echoes save this album! It is over 22 minutes musical travel trough many feelings and it really shows how skillful musicians Pink Floyd members are.
B000089CJI|5.0|this cd is one of the best out there, i'm a listener of punk and punk/metal music and i heard one of their songs on a snowboarding dvd and immediately went to get the cd, although it is the opposite in genre from my normal music it is excellent and you should definitely check it out, so dont be a poonjab and go buy this album
B00011RPB0|4.0|I had read many reviews for this movie and most of them give me a positive grasp Lost in Translation film. My very good friend asked me to come with her to see this movie. We went to cinema and both of us laughed a lot during the movie.<br /> This movie tells about american actor Harris(Bill Murray) who leaves to Japan in where he make so advertisments. Charlotte( Scarlett Johansson) is a young philosophy student whose husband works on Japan as ptotographer.<br /> Two sleepless people meets each other and find a special mental connection between their worlds. They dance, song Karaoke and talk together. Murray plays his part very well and shows that he can also act a serious man role(normally he plays comedy roles).<br />Johansson is only a 19 year old woman but she'll be a great future if she can pick as good roles as this movie.<br /> The most of this movie laughts come situations when Harris listen to interrupt from Japanese to English and notice that lot of meanings has lost in translation. If you understand Japanese language, you'll get a lot of more this movie.
B000002LR3|5.0|I love this album.  I can remember being introduced to their single- Loaded- when clubbing in London in the early 90s and decided to grab a copy of the album.  To my surprise- Loaded was probably one of the least listenable singles overall.   <br />Primal Scream has gone on to produce wonderful music over the past 10 years- stretching their themes and artistry to new heights while keeping one foot planted on their roots.  Before exploring these other options, however, experience Screamadelica and understand where they came from and why so many listeners rave
B000002UA0|5.0|Before I borrewed this album for library, I had heard Astronomy Domine and Bike songs for this Pink Floyd's debut album. Astronomy Domine was a very strange song and it taked some time to achieve its musical dimension. Nowadays I like it but it is not my favourites. Bike was a really funny and playful track that convicted me that there would be more same like songs on the Floyd's debut. I listened The Piper at the Gates of Dawn many times and it came a little better every listening time. Lusifer Sam, Matilda Mother and Flaming are my favourite songs. Especially, Flaming shows how creative, playful and extreaordinary(in positive way) musician Syd Barrett was. He was a real genious! Interstellar Overdrive is a instrumental masterpiece in which has lot of same musical elements that Pink Floys' other members used in their songs when Barrett time was end on Pink Floyd. There is no weak points on this album which is must for every Pink Floyd fan and those who like to listen psycedical rock music.
B00000DF6O|5.0|This is the greatest blues album ever!  Mastered by the greatest blues performer ever, BB King.  This album has such an easy feel to it.  The band is so together and BB, well, what can you say about the man, the performer, the singer, the guitar player.  Words can't describe him.  He's a national treasure and proves it on this disc and so many others he's cut over his great career.  It always makes me upset when they give the title of \\"superstar\\" to some of these no talent bums who permeate today's music industry.  BB truly is a superstar and proves it every time he plugs in Lucille and opens his mike with that wonderful, powerful, soulful voice.  Long live the King!
B0000089A1|4.0|It's more like 4 1/2. I can name a lot of good songs on this album, but somehow, it just doesn't reach nearly the level of greatness as a whole that the Kinks were capable of. It might be that as a theme to carry an album on, the music business isn't as compelling as other themes the Kinks had used in the past. For me, \\"Top of the Pops\\" \\"Strangers,\\" \\"Rats,\\" \\"Denmark Street,\\" \\"Moneygoround\\" \\"Powerman,\\" and \\"Get Back in the Line\\"(which is very moving but depressing, somewhat similar to \\"Dead End Street,\\" only more heavy-handed) are all very good, \\"This Time Tomorrow,\\" \\"Contenders,\\" and \\"Long Way from Home\\" are definitely not bad either, but if it weren't for \\"Lola,\\" \\"Apeman,\\" and \\"Got to Be Free,\\" the album wouldn't be nearly as worth it. Interestingly, those three songs have nothing to do with the music business.(You could say \\"Got to Be Free\\" is a reflection of Ray's anger towards the business, especially in the line \\"swear if I like\\" but the lyrics are a pretty universal sentiment.) If it wasn't for those three songs, this album would probably deserve more like 3 1/2 stars. Definitely get this version rather than the American version, because the alternate version of \\"Apeman\\" is superior to the original version. I actually recommend getting this album(or Muswell Hillbillies) first if you're buying the Kinks '66-'70 output- if you get this one last you may be disappointed.
B000069HK2|5.0|...then keep on usin' me, til you use me up.  definitely one of my favorite newer bands(i haven't found a group i like this much in ages).  awesome blend of music, vocals, with some appropriately placed great screams.  only one or two tracks that i didn't care much for, but the other songs more than make up for them.
B000002KON|5.0|Of the versions out now, don't get this one, get one of the imports- either the one with the bonus tracks or the one with the higher quality remastering but not the bonus tracks.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|So The Strokes were the &quot;definitive&quot; New York band when Is This It? came out (or so the reporters said). Their songs were catchy, with good hooks and muffled vocals that really didn't matter all that much. Fast forward to 2003. The Strokes are still pretty hot, but with the influx of &quot;garage rock&quot; bands, they seem to have become slightly lost in the crowd. Nonetheless, when Room On Fire came out, it was still anticipated greatly. Now I admit, I'm a fan of The Strokes. I've liked them since &quot;Last Nite&quot; first hit the airwaves, but this album sounds like...leftovers. However, slightly appetizing leftovers. Is This It? produced catchy songs, and so does Room On Fire because, well, it's almost identical to it. The first 4 tracks are my favorite. &quot;What Ever Happened?&quot; provides the typical &quot;Strokes&quot; guitar riff; bouncy and catchy. &quot;Reptilia&quot; (their current single) is the stand-out. With ferocious vocals and speedy guitar, it's pretty much the only song on the album that makes you still listen to the rest of it. &quot;Automatic Stop&quot; is a good tune, as is &quot;12:51&quot; (the first single). After that though, eh, it tends to all become a blur. Tracks 5 through 11 sound like a long, blurry rollercoaster ride; it has its ups and downs. Bottom Line: If you liked Is This It? pick it up, because it basically sounds exactly the same. If you're expecting The Strokes to have tried to enhance their sound or try out new things, forget it. <BR>At least they know when to follow a winning formula.
B00007ELEL|5.0|I have seen this movie more times than I can count. It is a fantastic journey about one lazy hippy. John Goodman give a spectacular performance as a disgruntled Vietnam Veteran. This movie may not be the funniest movie that I have seen, but it is the best comedy that I have seen. (Does that make any sense?) I guess it's the acting that I find so incredible. Either that or all of the very funny foul language. I have seen this movie on TV and it just isn't the same without all of the F-bombs!! My favorite part is when the Dude and Walter go to the kid's house, whom they think stole money from them, and Walter comes unglued!! He starts screaming &quot;This is what happens when you 'bleep' a stranger in the 'bleep'!!&quot; He then proceedes to take his agression out on the kids car with a crowbar. Very funny stuff, especially coming from John Goodman's mouth. Buy this movie. Now!

0064407667|5.0|The Bad Beginning<BR>Lemony Snicket<BR>Reviewed by: A Pandey<BR>Period : 5th<br />     The Baudelaire's are great and a wealthy family, but not for long.  Terrible news comes to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny when they were at the beach.  Mr. Poe their family's banker came and told the children's that their parents had died in a terrible fire.  Now the 3 kids Violet, who was interested in inventing stuff, Klaus who loved to read books, and Sunny who loved to bite things all became an orphan.  Violet being the oldest child swear oath that she will protect her siblings no matter what.  Mr. Poe took these orphans and gave them to Count Olaf, not knowing that he is an evil uncle.  The only thing Count Olaf did was tried to snatch the fortune of the Baudelaire.  The Baudelaire's parents had left an enormous amount of money for their kids but they could only get it when they turn 18.  Count Olaf tried to snatch the fortune by marring Violet because she is the oldest. He failed to get the Fortune and right before the police caught him he told the kids he would come back for the fortune!  Unfortunately, Count Olaf managed to escape when the police came.<BR>       I loved this book because this book does not have a happy ending like the other common books.  The author in this book actually tells the readers not to buy his work because its very sad, and not a happy ending.  You can never put this book down because in every chapter there is something new and exciting.  For instant at the end of the book no one knew that Violet would sign the marriage paper with her left hand. A thing like that really excites me. From the time of their parent's death till the escape of Count Olaf the book was never boring!  One of the favorite quotes I like in this book was when Count Olaf said,<BR>\\"I will come back to steal your fortune\\".  That quote is now going to make me read the next book.<BR>       There actually wasn't anything that I didn't like about this book.  I thought it would be boringby the cover; instead it came out to be a great book. I really liked the characters of this book because all the three Baudelaire's are different. Violet is trying to save her sister with the help of Klaus. Sunny has become a hostage until the marriage of Voilet and Count Olaf.  The other quote from this book is by Mr. Poe, \\" Your parents died in a terrible fire\\".  This quote had got me out of my bed and ready to read the great book.<BR>       My favorite part of the book was when; Count Olaf was going to marry Violet.  He had told her that if she doesn't agree with the marriage he would tell his members to kill her little sister, Sunny.  Violet was really scared and didn't want her sister to die, so she agreed by signing the paper.  Count Olaf was really happy and he was about to leave when Violet told everyone about him and what he wants to do by marrying her.  Violet also told i should not be married to him because I signed the paper with my left hand when, I always sign with my right hand.  The judge agreed and called the police to capture Count Olaf but he was too quick and he ran away.  This was my favorite part of the book because it was the most exciting part, you didn't know what would come next.

Carradine made it a more pacifictic show.In the '70 as well as today,TV and life is filled with sex and violence, and the ideas of only the strong survive and only beautiful people deserve the good things in life, Kung fu shows us violence should be the last resort and that all living things deserve respected.The philasphy on all aspectes of life presented in the shows are lessens we can all learn from and maybe this world would be a better place.
0452284937|4.0|Easy to read, yet full of life. I'm a 17 year old reader and I think the book's greatest attributes are the characters. Believable, deep, and interesting. The plot was outstanding. Sadly, after finishing the book, I was upset that it was already over! When I first bought the book, I was afraid it might be a waste of money - that this would be another one of those books that goes on forever and is ber-artsy, but it isn't at all. It touches on self-understanding and the realization of the differences and loves of others.
B00005K3LU|5.0|Off-duty cop (Bruce Willis) saves hostages and dispatches the sadistic bad guys against overwhelming odds; a simple plot, done many times since this 1988 thriller, but never done as effectively.  The difference:  This movie is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed.  The script balances heart-pounding action with funny one-liners that always make me laugh out loud.  Bruce Willis is wonderful as the Rambo-esque superguy who outwits, outplays, and outlasts the heavily-armed killers, and reveals just enough of his tender side to endear his character to the audience.<br /><br />Willis is backed up by outstanding supporting players who add depth and surprises:  Reginald Veljohnson is the sympathetic cop Willis talks to via radio during his ordeal. Alan Rickman plays the cruel, urbane gang leader with devilish flair.  He is assisted by the talented Alexander Godunov as a ruthless killer.<br /><br />The production values are top quality, the action never stops, and each stunt is unique and utterly stupendous.  I heartily recommend Die Hard to those who love action films and those who just love excellence in film.
0805066349|5.0|A good friend who is part Navajo gave me this book and told me I should read it...he told me it was important.  After reading it, I have seen things differently and I don't think I can go back.  I see everything differently, from my education to the way our country runs to the presidential politics.  Dee Brown's book has effected every corner of it.  I still meet people who are afraid to read it and even those who call it &quot;meta-fiction,&quot; made up stories by someone trying to make whites feel bad about taking land.  But ignorance can no longer help you stand.  This book shredded the ignorance that I once held on to.  Every American should read it and digest it and reflect on their own rights and privelages and be grateful.
B00008BXJ6|4.0|\\"\\"High Voltage\\"\\", AC/DC's first studio-recored album, is an excellent buy. Any fan of AC/DC should buy this album before any other AC/DC album. Though it doesn't stand up to their next album, \\"\\"Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap\\"\\", \\"\\"High Voltage\\"\\" does beat out \\"\\"Let There Be Rock\\"\\", \\"\\"Powerage\\"\\", \\"\\"Flick Of The Switch\\"\\", and \\"\\"Fly On The Wall\\"\\". This album was recorded with Angus Young on Guitar, Malcolm Young on Guitar, Bon Scott on Vocals, Rob Bailey on Bass, Peter Clack on Drums, George Young on Bass (For recording only), and Tony Currenti on Drums (For recording only), or Angus Young, Lead Guitar, Malcolm Young, Guitar, Bon Scott, Lead Singer, Phil Rudd, Drums, and Mark Evans, Bass, depending on who you ask. All songs are A. Young - M. Young - B. Scott, except \\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl\\", which is A. Young - M. Young.<br />\\"It's A Long Way To The Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)\\" (5:16) (4/5): A powerful track with a catchy riff. Describes the challenges of the rock 'n' roll life.<br />\\"Rock 'n' Roll Singer\\" (5:04) (4/5): A defiant track showing dislike of the \\"normal\\" crowd that disapproves of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle.<br />\\"The Jack\\" (5:52) (3/5): A playful track with a bluesy tone.<br />\\"Live Wire\\" (5:50) (4/5): Another strong track with a screaming chorus.<br />\\"T.N.T.\\" (3:34) (5/5): The best song on this album. The Young brothers' blasting guitars compliment the vocals, the whole band gets in on the singing, it has a strong chorus, and feautures Bon Scott's scream and singing voice.<br />\\"Can I Sit Next To You Girl\\" (4:12) (3/5): This song showcases Bon Scott's voice.<br />\\"Little Lover\\" (5:37) (3/5): Another more bluesy song which again showcases Bon's voice and attitude.<br />\\"She's Got Balls\\" (4:51) (3/5): A slightly odd song, which is, apparently, a tribute to Bon Scott's wife.<br />\\"High Voltage\\" (4:03) (4/5): A song that that captures the AC/DC spirit and is similar to \\"Rock 'n' Roll Singer\\" in its defiance. A powerful, loud, overall great track.
B00005QDW1|4.0|No Doubt was the head of the ska revival in the mid-90's. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was a frantic clash of ska, pop, rock, show tunes, and (oddly enough) disco influences. Their next record &quot;Return of Saturn&quot; (which holds claim to some of their best songs, period)  fueled their maturity and, while not selling nearly as much as &quot;Tragic Kingdom,&quot; the critically acclaimed album left a mark of No Doubt's shifting styles and rapidly growing maturity. Gwen expanded her repertoire with guest spots on &quot;South Side,&quot; Moby's synth- and hook-heavy smash and on rapper Eve's hit &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind.&quot; Fresh off of these steps into newer territory and the broody &quot;Return of Saturn,&quot; it appeared No Doubt was ready for a change.<br />That change was instantly evident. &quot;Hey Baby,&quot; the first single off of this, their remarkable third mainstream album, was dancehall reggae (on American radio, anyway) at its finest. Fans of No Doubt's previous styles, however, were completely and wholly appalled. But they have no reason to be. &quot;Rock Steady,&quot; while far from their previous jewels, is still No Doubt in fine form. Hooky, sugary, and addictive, &quot;Rock Steady&quot; pushes the envelope on what one band can do. <br />Filled to the brim with pulsating, bright and synth-heavy instrumentals, the mostly reggae influences of the album are totally obvious. Many of the songs, however, have a deeper and more complex meaning than suggested by their simple melodies. &quot;Running,&quot; a gorgeous ballad set over a simple two or three note beat, has deeper tones of angst and, of course, the amazing vocals of frontwoman Stefani, which, if humanly possible, are even stronger and more well-rounded this go round. &quot;Waiting Room,&quot; a consistently brash and off-center tune produced by Prince (who also guest stars) is one of the gems here--but there's no denying the sheer audacity of sticking in a song like (let alone titled as) &quot;Platinum Blonde Life,&quot; a glorious throwback to Debbie Harry territory. The filler is few and far between here--perhaps only &quot;Underneath It All&quot; and the title track are skippable, and gems pepper throughout. &quot;Rock Steady&quot; surprisingly works. And it's a pleasant surprise.

B000060P79|1.0|Good Charlotte.  Newfound Glory.  Simple Plan.<br />Those are all names that are frequently heard in modern day &quot;rock.&quot;  But folks, this isn't punk.  It's pop.<br />I can not argue against you that liking pop is not a sin.  Because it isn't.  As a matter of fact, I like some pop.  But moving on.<br />For those of you saying that this describes a teenagers life. . . . you're wrong.  It's a fact.  For example, &quot;I'd Do Anything.&quot;  I know that you would like to get the one and only guy/girl, but who cares?  That's nothing unique.  Mankind were meant to like each other, and to become wed and produce more humans.  So just 'cause you want a girlfriend/boyfriend doesn't mean you're emotional.<br />Wait a moment.  Do my eyes deceive me?  I see two reviews that say Simple Plan has BILLIONS of fans.  6 billion people in the world.  About.  Many cultures, a lot of different music.  Billions, implying more than one billion.  I know I'm being technical, but aren't you Simple Plan lovers being technical too?<br />The reason Simple Plan got a recod label because it was what pop music, or at least the record label, was looking for: something that teenagers all over America would love as &quot;punk.&quot;  They were right.  Simple Plan has been loved by the AVERAGE teen.  But then this &quot;deep emotional punk&quot; thing started appearing.  Emotional?  Deep?  Punk?<br />I'll give you a few minutes to think about that.<br />Overall, this music shouldn't really be listened to.  Not a lot of talent.  The guitars are just chords blasting into an amplifier.  Pierre has a whiny voice.  But if you like it, what can I do?<br />This review will probably get a &quot;13 out of 46 helpful&quot; rating, but it doesn't matter.<br />These are facts.<br />This is not music.
0385504209|2.0|The only reason this book didn't get one star is because I did actually take the time to finish it, though at a whopping 2 days it wasn't exactly a huge accomplishment.  I, like most everyone else who's read the book, did so because of the extensive word of mouth it has received.  And I must admit, the beginning did grab my attention, but that is where my praise for this novel will end.<br />I am surprised that the same word of mouth that caused this book to be such a huge seller has not acted equally as quick to bring its sales to a grinding halt.  This work is sure to disappoint, and I truly believe that those still clinging to their belief that this is a masterful work of fiction formed that opinion before reading the prologue, well before reading the exceedingly trite ending.<br />As mentioned in countless other reviews, the ending is ridiculous, but in addition to that, the whole novel is filled cheesy cliches befitting a low budget teeny bopper movie such as You Got Served.  Case in point, several flashbacks to Robert Langdon's Harvard classroom.  The dialogue between professor and students is so contrived and forced its vomit inducing.  Clearly Brown was trying to impart some historical context for the scene, however, these scenes were all miserable failures at an attempt to be creative.  I even kind of laughed because Robert would be in the middle of some particularly stressful moment and then all of a sudden he would remember a conversation he had with students in his classroom at Harvard...how he was surprised the dopey jock knew the answer to his tough question, the cleaver banter he had with the biology major who could only relate to the world within a biological context, and above all, the &quot;warm feeling&quot; that came over him reminding him &quot;this is why I teach.&quot;  Please, has anybody in a college classroom like this?  And then after 15 pages...oh yeah! People are chasing me!  We have to figure out this puzzle, and what's up with that dead guy?  Just seemed a little ridiculous to me.<br />In the end, you will be left wanting your 15 bucks, or your two days, or your two weeks, or whatever you invested in this book back.  Do people a favor and spread this, and some of the other reviews on here around, and let's stop wasting everybody's time.  Though I don't have much hope, because I get on the bus or the subway everyday and I always see at least two people reading this book.  It's too late for them, but we can still help others.d guy?

B000002J03|4.0|after getting led zeppelin 4 i wanted to delve deeper into the earlier roots of the greatest band in rock history. and only on this album have i finally understood why everyone says led zeppelin is the most influential band in rock and roll history. to me this was a lot more of a jam album than 4 and i like that a lot better. the blues was good and the rock was awesome. the bass stood out more on this record and john bonham on moby dick is crazy. has longer solos and plant is just plant. it impresses i will be getting more led zeppelin
B00009V7T2|2.0|Ok, I've heard bands try to do this before.  The whole &quot;space-rock&quot; genre is a great scene, and there are tons of bands making some wonderful music. Unfortunately the Mars Volta is not one of them.  The first problem is the song writing.  Sure not all bands want to &quot;sell out&quot; by writing good songs, but jesus, you have to have good songs to make an album.  There are exactly two good songs on De-Loused...and they are &quot;Roulette Dares&quot; and &quot;Inertiatic ESP.&quot;  These are really cool songs that feature catchy, inventive riffs along with convincing vocals.  The rest of the album is basically crap, with extended forays into 6/8 timing that don't sound good at all.  <br />It isn't the musicians, because they are incredible.  In fact, I saw a live video of them, and the drummer blew me away.  What struck me was that the drummer seemed TOO good for the rest of them, including cedric and omar.  <br />This is one of those albums with all the right players, but it doesn't add up to anything.  Listening to this album is just plain boring and no fun.  Sure, there are funny sounds, weird rythmic breakdowns and of course those signature vocals. But again, it just doesn't add up to anything substantial or memorable.  Like in &quot;Drunkship of Lanterns,&quot; there is that cool latin sounding riff with the organ, but it only occurs sparsely in the song, surrounded by a bunch of directionless crap.  I would call this album a &quot;get stoned and jam&quot; session, and then let Rick Rubin edit the hell out of it. I don't like the thick soupy production. It's way too layered.  But I think Rubin had to do that, realizing that there really isn't much good material on this album.  <br />If you want to listen to music like this that is actually good, go buy &quot;Jupiter&quot; by Cave-in, or the new Coheed and Cambria album.<br />Bottomline: pretentious, directionless, sporadic, occasionally interesting, no feeling, not memorable, no good songs, stupid guitar solos that sound like &quot;santana&quot; but with none of the emotion or musicianship.
B000006TRV|4.0|i originally wanted to broaden my musical horizons and look into some older classical rock bands. growing up in the '90s and in todays world i dont really get a dose of history. the only thing ive ever heard about pink floyd was 'another brick in the wall' and ive never heard about until i watched a movie with the music. anyway i bought this cd and i was unimpressed in the beginning and kinda weirded out. but it got better and better. until i realized this is exactly what im looking for. this album is not another cd whre aritsts put a bunch of songs together. this is a work of art this whole double disk cd is like one song. and this one song has everything from blues to rock to opera to psychedalic. its pop sometimes and hard rock other times. its like watching a play but actually enjoying the experience. very very nice i will be listening for a while.
B0001US8EO|5.0|I consider this movie to be the most accurate movie ever made about Wyatt Earp's Life. This was the only movie which I was able to recommend a few years ago to my Kid's School history Dept.<br />Russel's Tombstone was great entertainment and had a lot of factual props and clothing but Costner really nailed the history with his movie. <br />I am looking forward to the Wyatt Earp DVD and will be ordering it in the near future. I hope that the DVD will have additional scenes and especialy will include more of the Ringo Character which seemed strangely absent from the original release.<br />I have installed a link on my Tombstone History Discussion Forum: [...] to the Amazon ordering page and would encourage all to order this historic DVD.
B000021XS0|4.0|i started playing drums oh about a year and a half ago. and what ever cd i put on was just basic stuff and i learned it fast until one day i heard dream theater and it just blew me away. now granted there great rock drummer all over the place but my favorite has to be mike portnoy of dream theater he is just great. my favorite tracks on this album is the ocncept tracks the middle eastern tinge or just all out rock. these guys know how to put a jam together. the only reason i cant give this a five is the songs with singer takes over. its so bland and poppish and boring. i really cant stand it sorry. and please i really dont care about victoria come on.

B000002L9O|1.0|This a lame, lame Ramones record.  The only good tune is My Brain Is Hanging Upside Down.  I can't believe anyone bothered to reissue this on cd.  You are a complete sucker if you buy this cd.
B000002UAO|5.0|Before reviewing \\"Rubber Soul\\" I have to thank Capitol for reissuing the UK version (or the original version) of \\"Rubber Soul\\" instead of the travesty that was the US version released by Capitol.  By rereleasing the UK version, we can finally experience the complete album instead of a shortened, edited album.  Anyway, this album, I think, is the Beatles greatest album, though Revolver comes in as a close second, and Sgt. Pepper and Abbey Road are tied for thrid.  But with this album, you have the departure from the \\"Beatlemania\\" days and into a more Dylan-esque, lyrically-driven style, where each song is good, the Beatles early albums had some great songs, but there was filler.  However, on \\"Rubber Soul\\" there is no filler.  Also, \\"Rubber Soul\\" inspired Brian Wilson to compose \\"Pet Sounds\\" which truly is the greatest album of all time.  On this album, the Beatles move on from simple, innocent love songs, to more complex and thoughtful songs.  \\"In My Life\\" is a perfect example of this.  My favorites are \\"Drive My Car\\", \\"You Won't See Me\\", \\"The Word\\", \\"In My Life\\", \\"Norwegian Wood\\", and \\"If I Needed Someone\\".
B000092Q7O|5.0|This monumental retelling of real events from 1939 Warsaw through the end of World War II is now atop my list of favorite films, joining \\"The Godfather\\", \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"All The President's Men\\" on that pinnacle. There is little in my existence that presents a more shattering, emotional and involving real life story than this astounding film.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it (poor you!), it's a nearly three hour review of events that occurred in Poland from the time of the Nazis invasion and occupation in 1939, through the development of the Warsaw ghetto, to the trains hauling people away to concentration camps, to the resistance fighting to regain their country, to the Russians eventual arrival in 1945. In an afterthought, it appears everything ends well...although we all know Stalin and the USSR put Poland under its thumb in 1945.<br /><br />The film tells the real life story of a Polish pianist, a national treasure, that was hidden during the war. The first hour of the film is told through his family's travails; the rest through his life. His story is told in remarkable vignettes of battles in the streets of Poland with some of the best war footage ever created for the screen. It won exceptionally well-deserved Oscars for Adrien Brody and director Roman Polanski and the adapted screenplay from the book by its subject, Wladysalv Szpilman.<br /><br />The score to this film, available on a remakable Sony CD, is not only a generous offering of music from the film but one of the better Chopin collections of recent years, very well-played by extrovert pianist Janusz Olejnicak. It includes one of Szpilman's own Chopin pieces, circa 1948.<br /><br />My one complaint: Can someone explain to me how the little entertainment \\"Chicago\\" beat out this film for best film of 2002 as judged by the Motion Picutre Academy? What a travesty! Here is a once in a decade film and surely the best World War II story since \\"The English Patient\\" and better than that flick! Adrien Brody at least won the Oscar for best actor. Maybe he deserved that but this film surely deserved best movie. It is probably the best film of the new century.r best actor. Maybe he deserved that but this film surely deserved best movie. It is probably the best film of the new century.
B0000DJZA5|1.0|I'll admit that I've never been a huge fan of Phil Spector's production of &quot;Let It Be&quot;, but this is even worse.  So it's de-&quot;Spectorized&quot; but gone are the rough edges of the old album that made it one of my favorites.  I think that EMI/Captiol/Apple should stop messing around with classics and release &quot;Let It Be&quot; on DVD, I think that's what most Beatles fans want, not an album that you could find on the &quot;Anthology&quot; discs.
B00006CXXU|5.0|With the release of this album, &quot;Stripped&quot;, Christina is stripped away from the pop music world and into the kind of music that she wants to sing, featuring the single, &quot;Dirrty&quot; (featuring Redman), and that's the song that helped her open up with the way she looks now, and she's as free as a bird with this album! Never has anyone known that Christina would soon transform into the way she wants to, and it's totally cool! The songs that are so cool on this album are:<br />&quot;Dirrty&quot; (featuring Redman)<BR>&quot;Beautiful&quot; <BR>&quot;Fighter&quot;<BR>&quot;Can't Hold Us Down&quot; (featuring Lil' Kim)<BR>&amp; &quot;The Voice Within&quot;
B0000DJZA5|5.0|This is the Way 'Let It Be' should have sounded when it was first released. Although I am confident that if the Beatles were able to hear this CD as released, they would have nitpicks that annoyed them about it, I am also confident that this is far closer to their original conception of 'Let It Be' than we have ever heard before. Although the fillers &quot;Maggie Mae&quot; and &quot;Dig It&quot; are notably (and I think, thankfully) absent, as is the banter from the rooftop, I think this is a much more pure album in concept, and certainly the digital processing has cleaned it up a lot. Gone are all the traces of &quot;Spectorization&quot; the guys (especially Paul) hated. Although never one of my favorites &quot;The Long And Winding Road&quot; sounds especially better without the extras.<br />Standouts for me are &quot;Get Back&quot; (although I do kind of miss the rooftop chatter), &quot;One After 909&quot;, which sounds wonderful: it is now so much more polished and crisp than ever before, &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, on which George and the guitar work sound especially powerful and the title track, &quot;Let It Be&quot;, which is, evidently, a combination of edits, featuring the George solo from the movie, which I have always preferred above all the other solos (especially the John solo on the original LP) which sounds incredibly sharp. Ringo's drum part seems more pronounced and crisp, and the whole song comes across as the melodic masterpiece that it is.<br />Downsides for me are &quot;I've Got a Feeling,&quot; which, though never a personal favorite, is particularly raw to an uncomfortable degree, especially vocally, and the bonus CD &quot;Fly On The Wall,&quot; which could have been a good 'alternate takes' or 'deleted tracks' CD. Instead it is really a very disjointed set of snippets of different songs some of which you have heard before, and some you probably haven't (included are some songs that would shortly become solo releases of former Beatles, notably &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;). The bonus is worth listening to about one time for a historical perspective, but in my judgment that's about it.<br />There are things that long time Beatles fans such as myself would change about this CD, but overall it is indispensable and deserves to be on every music lover's CD rack. Buy it today!;All Things Must Pass&quot;).

B000002KKD|5.0|Formed in 1976 as a lark, the five-member Athens, Georgia band made a hit on the dance club scene with their unexpected tongue-in-cheek lyrics and weirdly retro &#34;Twilight Zone&#34; sound.  But they didn't really get off the ground in a big way until 1979, when their self-titled debut release pretty much put the &#34;new&#34; in 1970s and 1980s New Wave--and even today it's hard to think of that era without contemplating it.<br /><br />Opening with the memorable &#34;Planet Claire,&#34; with its retro-rhythms, electronic pings, and truly off the wall lyrics, the band puts you on notice: it will be quite unlike anything you've heard before.  And that holds true through virtually every cut.  Of course, whether you like it or not is an entirely different matter: it can be difficult to relate to music made with such instruments as smoke-detectors, toy pianos, and a stripped down guitar-bass-drums combo, not to mention lyrics that often seem to be thrown together from the first rhyming words the band could think of.  Quite a few people will find that a little of it goes a long way.<br /><br />But it grows on you.  It really does.  &#34;52 Girls,&#34; with Cindy Wilson and Kate Pierson spewing out female names very much like you'd recite state capitols in high school, is wickedly funny once you manage to tune into it--and when you move on to &#34;Dance this Mess Around&#34; you're hooked, plugged into Cindy and Kate's alternately strident, alternately harmonic vocals and Fred Schneider's unexpected rap-like interjections.<br /><br />For all its weirdness, this is music designed to get you on your feet, and on draggy days when I don't quite feel up to the task I can drop this particular CD on the stereo and &#34;dance this mess around&#34; all the way to a spotless kitchen.  Much of the B-52's music takes off from pop culture, with a very specific emphasis on those alternately bizarre and utterly lame 1950s and 1960s sci-fi drive-in flicks that live so fondly in cult-fan-memory.  &#34;Rock Lobster,&#34; a classic of its kind, is a perfect example, subverting Frankie and Annette's rear-projection waves into mundo-bizarro tanning butter; &#34;Lava&#34; is a wild mix of drop-dead sultry and drop-dead wacko; &#34;There's a Moon in the Sky&#34; can only be described as the musical equivalent of Flash Gordon on acid.<br /><br />My particular guilty pleasure from this CD is the flat-out warped &#34;6060-842,&#34; the twisted fable of Tina's visit to the ladies' room and the telephone number written on the wall.  But whether it's the sexually perverse &#34;Hero Worship&#34; or trashing Petula Clark's 1960s pop hit &#34;Down Town,&#34; its all just a lot of fun.  If you only know The B-52's from their later, pop-tinged party hits, you owe yourself this one.  Turn up the volume and make the neighbors roll their eyes and wonder what you're doing!<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer#34; a classic of its kind, is a perfect example, subverting Frankie and Annette's rear-projection waves into mundo-bizarro tanning butter; &#34;Lava&#34; is a wild mix of drop-dead sultry and drop-dead wacko; &#34;There's a Moon in the Sky&#34; can only be described as the musical equivalent of Flash Gordon on acid.

B0001611DI|4.0|First off, I gave this DVD four stars instead of five just because I too know a more expanded version is to be released later this year.  But that fact aside, I still think this DVD is a good buy.<br />Now I've read a few reviews going on (negatively) about how  this is the theatrical version of the film and that the Director's Cut is better.  Well, it's only better if you like a bunch of excess, and to me, really boring dialog.  When I brought the video tape of it (the Director's Cut), I was expecting to see an extra 20 minutes of gore, but except for just one cool scene, it was all dialog.  Dialog, that in my opinion, that didn't add a thing to it.  In fact, this twenty minutes reminds of the outtakes from Jaws.  I was glad they were taken out.<br />George Romero has said that the Theatrical Cut of the film is his favorite.  And I'm glad it's the one on this DVD.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a gem. There've been so many good movies lately that I wonder if we're going through a renaissance of Hollywood movies, towards the great period of the early seventies, when the US was making good films about serious themes.<br />This, &quot;21 Grams&quot;, &quot;Mystic River&quot;, &quot;Shattered Glass&quot;, and a host of others, make such a welcome change from the routine. Scarlett Johansson is a luminous talent. You should also watch her in &quot;The Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot;. Bill Murray shows he can act when given the chance, as he did in the excellent &quot;Groundhog Day&quot;. Those who want to see him just goofing off Ghostbusters style should look elsewhere.<br />And Coppola. It's a name that already means a lot to film lovers. Now it means even more. And I can't wait for her next film.
B0000WN0VY|5.0|I heard Damien play a song on Carson Daly's super late program, and it woke me from my sleep. I even got up and wrote his name down in my groggy state. A few months later, I found his CD at one of my local stores. It was the limited edition disk, but I figured may as well take a chance for a few more bucks. Jumped in the car, setting aside my other CD purchases, set the preset to C&amp;W, and popped in &quot;O&quot;. I spent the next hour driving around in awe of what I was hearing. Each song was intricately beautiful. The lyrics were amazing, each instrument does exactly what it's supposed to, when it's supposed to, the mixing is flawless, and just when you get to the end of a song, it flows right into the next. This CD followed me into the house, and back to the car again for about a week before I remembered that I bought a few others, and decided to give them a go.<BR>  My few complains are that he lets his female counterpart sing too many notes in disharmony with him. There are points when it is beautiful, but there are points when it gets old. His lyrics are a bit young sometimes, but you can feel the emotion and the passion behind them, so this can be forgiven. My final complaint is that some of his better songs were left OFF the CD. The songs: The Professor and Lonelily are two of my favorites and they are absent from the disk.<BR>  In short, this CD is like a great novel. You get involved with the characters and the emotion, and you can't get away from it. And when you can finally come up for air, you insist that your friends give it a go as well. I can hardly wait to see what Damien gives us next.
B00005JN1L|4.0|This movie really has a nice plot to it and I love susspenseful  movies and this one tops it off big time!I took a day off from college on Friday, March 12, 2004.I went with my friend Ryan, my rooomate at TCU.We went to the movies and saw this.I thought it was scary and had a good swing to it.Of course, this is based on a Stephen King novella, and Stephen King comes up with these ideas like \\"It\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\".I really likje this movies since my major is writing, but I also want to be a director.John Turturro is also at his best.I liked John in Mr.Deeds and Anger Management, but I would of never pictured him in a thriller like this.And Johnny Depp is a great star in this movie.He was also good in, \\"Pirates of the Carribean:The Curse of the Black Pearl\\", \\"Edward Scissor hands, and \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\\"Anybody with a thing for scary and suspenseful movies, SEE THIS!!!!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Finally, a hip hop album that actually has some real content.  Stepping away from the women, money, and other bs that is a lot of hip hop today.  Kanye was/is a producer originally, and you can tell hes still got it cuz the beats are off the hook.  The lyrics are real, and when that happens the music shines too.  Kanye is still far from a great MC because he lacks the flow, but this is only his first album and hes already proved to be much better than a lot of the MCs out there.  Its always good to see hip hop come back in this direction.  In the end youve got a solid, lengthy album (20 tracks), almost all of which are worth listening to.  It's gonna be pretty hard for Kanye to top this one in the future.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|&quot;This movie is one of the great ones it has everything you need and want in a movie and more.&quot;  &quot;I gave this movie 5 stars because it is one of those movies you can just sit with a blanket, snack, and someone to snuggle with and watch it over and over again.&quot;
B00008K9Z5|5.0|I've been a huge fan of Linkin Park since &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was released back in 2000. The rock/rap vibe they had on that cd was incredible, and on &quot;Meteora&quot;, they prove once again that their creativity and musical talent carries a force unlike any other. Mike Shinoda, Chester Bennington, Brad Delson, Rob Bourdon, Joseph Hahn, and Phoenix put forth an album that combines so much energy, emotion, and talent, that it is without a doubt genuine. Chester's vocal range on this album is awesome. At one moment he can be screaming at the top of his lungs, and at another he'll be gracefully singing. Mike Shinoda adds to the chaotic or melodious feels for the songs with his fresh rhymes. Brad delivers the powerful guitar riffs, as he always does, with Phoenix adding bass to the background to give each track more punch. Joseph Hahn adds the finishing touches to each song with his turntable skills, and shows it especially on &quot;Session&quot;. I love all the songs on this cd because each has it's own way of influencing me. The catchy first single &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; proves to the world that Linkin Park's sophomore album will be highly acclaimed. What Linkin Park tries to do is take all their musical influences and combined them into every song they create. By mixing rock with hip-hop with even some alternative, they demonstrate attitudes of true musicians. <br />The tracks on this cd that will appeal to those who love the aggressiveness of Linkin Park include &quot;Don't Stay&quot;, &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot;, &quot;Lying From You&quot;, &quot;Hit The Floor&quot;, &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Figure .09&quot;, &quot;From The Inside&quot;, and &quot;Numb&quot;. The other 5 songs, not including the intro, are more experimental and bring forth the characteristics that make &quot;Meteora&quot; such a phenomenal cd. &quot;Easier to Run&quot; is very emotional and Chester does an excellent job of expressing his vocal range without overdoing it. &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, the song Mike Shinoda arranged, is a track unlike any other that Linkin Park has put on a cd. It sounds upbeat yet soothing, and delivers lyrics which can be interpreted in many ways. It also has orchestra playing in the background. &quot;Nobody's Listening&quot; is a song that may surprise people upon first listening to it. The track begins with Joseph Hahn playing a sample of a Japanese flute, similar to the one at the beginning of &quot;Faint&quot; (but not as high pitched), then Mike begins to rhyme with Chester following with the catchy chorus. &quot;Session&quot; is the hip-hop beat/electronic DJ based track which lets Joseph Hahn try and exceed the skills he had on the &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; song &quot;Cure For The Itch&quot;. You will not regret buying this album by Linkin Park! Their creativity and musicianship will leave you speachless!
B000002UAO|5.0|Come on people! This is Rubber Soul we're talking about! How do you not like this album? This shows their true colors, different from their albums prior to this one. Times were changing in society and the Beatles had something to say about it through this album. This is one of the greatest albums of all time and definetly one of the greatest albums of the Beatles, if not their greatest. So don't hesitate getting this album. Without it, you don't know true rock 'n' roll. I have my third copy and it is great! GET THIS!
B000002UJQ|5.0|An absolutely amazing, brilliant masterpiece of an album. Elicits so much pure emotion and thought that everything else just pales in comparison.<br />If this isn't a 5 star album then I don't know what is.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|33 years ago in 1971, George gave the proceeds from Concert for Bangladesh to help millions in India to meet basic survival needs. He created the novel idea of benefit concerts that many others have continued until today. So it is more than appropriate for all his friends and extended family to honor him in this way. The music may look like another \\"greatest hits\\" compilation or nostalgic tribute, but it is really much more than that. Great care and attention to every detail/ note and lyric is given but there is also real Heart and Soul in this DVD. Everyone on stage appears to be very happy to be part of this celebration. At times there may have been 30 or more musicians and singers on stage! I've just finished watching this DVD today and I feel uplifted and exhilarated. It truly does deserve the 100's of 5 star ratings that have been presented by reviewers. The sound is superb, the filming was perfect, maybe I will give this a 108 star rating! If you're a fan of George's solo work or even a longtime Beatles fan you Can't miss with this DVD. Michael Palin said, \\"It was absolutely everyone at their peak. I think the energy there was hitting way above the levels.\\" When you see this Dvd you'll know what he meant. Jeff Lynne and Eric Clapton were both exceptional playing and singing George's songs as well as Joe and Sam Brown. One idea I have for a Travelling Wilburys type super group would be the linking together of Jeff, Paul, Eric, and Ringo with possibly Billy Preston on keyboards, Wow!!!              I'll end with a quote from an old Richard Rodgers song as my tribute to George.     When you walk through a storm, hold your head up high, And don't be afraid of the dark.            At the end of a storm, there's a golden sky, and the sweet silver song of a lark.               Walk on through the wind and rain, though your dreams be tossed and blown. Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart, and you'll never walk alone... and you'll never walk alone..... Thanks for reading, blessings to you.... Jai Jayaraj!..... Jayaraj is Ravi Shankar's name for George and is included in Arpan, (offering) the work he wrote just for George for this occasion.
B000002KHB|2.0|I give credit to Deep Purple for being heavy metal and hard rock pioneers, but musically, I've never found this band nearly as interesting, memorable or creative as their contemporaries. Ritchie Blackmore's guitarwork is somewhat average. I mean, the main riff of Smoke on the Water, despite being a ballpark classic, just kind of sits there. It reminds me of a dumbed down heavy Cream riff. And vocally and lyrically, the band doesn't have a whole lot to offer.<br />I've heard previous reviewers claim Deep Purple as being superior to Led Zeppelin, all I can say is \\"to each his own\\". Led Zeppelin drew influences from a wide variety of music styles and where blessed with having a brilliant guitarist in Jimmy Page and strong rhythym section in Bonzo and JPJ who where intent on making a sound all their own. Some of Deep Purple's stuff could have easily been passed off as any other early 70's rock band. They neither have the creative song writing brilliance of Led Zep nor the elegantly sludgy heavy grooves of Black Sabbath. Even Jethro Tull has better moments.<br />So, not a horrible band by any means, just not a very interesting one in my opinion.
B00005JLT5|2.0|B O R I N G!   This movie shows the worst qualities of any people on the face of the Earth. A whole race of people goes to their certain death without raising the slightest bit of resistance. The story lacks a hero. It is about a field mouse that hides and scrounges for food in war torn Warsaw. Meanwhile a small group of resistance fighters take on the Germans in what ever way they can with absolutely no support from our less than adequate field-mouse-like main character. He doesn't give a Darn about anyone but himself. Not his family, nor his fellow Jews. The only hero in the movie was a German officer who gave food to his pet mouse for performing tricks. <br />Jews of today take no guff from anyone and must be profoundly embarrassed by this movie about sheep being led to slaughter. While it's good to make new generations aware of genocide, the Holocaust was sixty years ago. Get over it already. It will never happen to the Jews again. Although very recently genocide was perpetrated on the Kurds in Iraq. <br />Due to the injustices bestowed on Jews, the movie makes a blatant attempt to blame America for not declaring war on Germany in order to save them. Maybe we should've taken Iraq when the Kurd genocide began. <br />As an American, I cannot stomach this lack of backbone. Think of 9-1-1. Think of the first three flights going down at almost the same time. Everyone was told to stay calm and the hijacking will take its course without further incident. Think of flight 93 learning of the other three crashes. Think of the true American heroes on that flight who decided that it was better to die than to allow terrorists to kill other innocent people. <br />I rest my case. This movie shows the worst attributes of human beings. <br />Worth watching, not worth buying.
0783225857|5.0|Making justice in a film to the best novel in the twentieth century (determined by vote of librarians across the US) is not an easy task. I would say that although there are a few elements of the novel that get lost in the movie, it is still a great production regardless. That is probably why it was nominated for eight Academy Awards in 1962, including best picture, best actor (Gregory Peck), best actress in a supporting role (Mary Badham), best director (Robert Mulligan), best screenplay, best black and white cinematography, best black and white art direction and best original musical score. The movie won two of the eight awards, best art direction and best actor.<br />The story revolves around the experiences of Scout, a little girl who is telling a story from her childhood. Her father is assigned as the defense attorney of a black young man falsely accused of raping a white girl. The movie does a good job in disseminating the book's main message: racism is destructive and has no basis to exist in our society. If you consider that the book was written in 1960, this is not a minor point, but on the contrary it is a very powerful statement. The movie also does a great job in portraying the qualities found in the character of Atticus Finch, a father who is raising two kids by himself, after losing his wife, and is doing a splendid job at it. Not only he differs from the norm at the time because he never hits his children, but he also tries not to influence their ideas of what is wrong and right. Instead of promoting hatred in Scout and Jem against the people that are racist and unfair, he tries to teach them tolerance to understand that these individuals are acting mostly out of fear. Throughout the story one can observe how the two siblings go from considering Atticus an old man who could not play football with other dads to seeing him as a hero with outstanding values.<br />It is hard to decide how to rate a movie that is based on such an incredibly awesome book. First, because it is harder to convey the &quot;child's view&quot; in the movie while this is very clear in the book. Second because there are passages of the book that were left out, and although they are not crucial to the story they give it a certain charm (for example the visit of Jem and Scout to Calpurnia's church). Therefore, if I use the book as a benchmark, the movie should be rated four stars. However, I think it makes more sense to compare the movie with other movies, and in this comparison it is extremely clear that &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is as good as it gets, consequently deserving the five stars rating.irst, because it is harder to convey the &quot;child's view&quot; in the movie while this is very clear in the book.

B00000ING2|5.0|Fantastic!!!  Brilliant script, brilliant performances, brilliant direction, brilliant score, brilliant production design!!!  Did I mention how brilliant it is?  My favorite Coen Bros. film.  When are we going to get a proper DVD release of this film?
0425188809|5.0|Although I enjoy a good Koontz book from time to time, I was hesitant to read this book based upon what little I knew about it; to wit, a dog and a monster escape from an evil government military laboratory.  It sounded too 50s B movie.  I was wrong.  This is an all out great book filled with great characters, great plot, and great themes.  This is a book that will bring a shiver to your spine, a chuckle to your belly, and a tear to your eye.  This is a book that will enrich your life.  I give few five star ratings, but this book deserves all five of its stars.
0671015206|2.0|On a whim I decided to pick up The Millionaire Next Door, having been recommended it several times - I'm glad I bought it discounted, and not necessarily for the reasons the authors would give.<br />The authors have a distinct definition of `wealthy' which differs from the `average American'. Rather than defining a wealthy person as one who `[has] an abundance of material possessions', they define a wealthy person as one who `[owns] substantial amounts of appreciable assets'. They explain that `many people who display a high-consumption life-style have little or no investments, appreciable assents, income-producing assets, common stokes, bonds, private businesses, oil/gas rights, or timber land' (pg. 13). The rest of the book relies heavily on statistics and scattered brief excerpts from interviews from millionaires and wealthy people defending this position.<br />I found this book to be woefully repetitive, its easy to discern what Stanley and Danko are on about after the first chapter.<br />Very little advice is offered for people earning lower incomes regarding how to save and make use of what they do earn. The majority of the suggestions are aimed at mid to high income individuals and families. The suggestions the authors give on how to conserve wealth come off more often than not as being cheap, rather than reasonably frugal advice. Some luxury must be allowed to enjoy life, and this point is not addressed.<br />Overall it may be worth reading, it does offer some surprising insights into the households of America's millionaires, but it wouldn't be first on my recommended reading list.

B0000035E7|1.0|Nirvana's Bleach is proof the masses who have always follwed the band all conform to society even though they'll never fess up and admit it. I've seen that Nirvana fans, more than any other fanbase, go along with anything Kurt Cobain says, despite the fact he was just as much a hypocrite as the rich he says he despised. Once he became a millionare, he had no reason to perform anymore because he no longer could sing from the perspective of poor loser outcast. Why he continued to perform and still self-proclaim himself a punk rocker is a mystery. I just think he was trying to justify himself until he took the easy route out in April of 1994. Kurt Cobain was a bratty, spoiled little art poseur. Nirvana had been playing nearly three years before Bleach was released, so the band wasn't in its infancy like the fans in denial like to believe. Bleach sounds so bad because the band blew. Clever. Take away the inlay and packaging with all those drunken, hairtossing photos, and then give a person unfamiliar with the band a listen, I gaurantee they'll say it's schitt. Cobain became part of the rich elitists, and yet thought by not dressing the part he was somehow excluding himself from them, but he WAS them; he just didn't look the part. A yuppie dressed in rags is still a yuppie, right? Right. And that's exactly what Cobain was. He had all the luxuries a yuppie wants, and no, a Lexus is not required for one to be a yuppie. Each second of Bleach will make you regret the $18.00 you shelled out for it. Nothing on it is melodic, depressing, insightful, emotional, passionate, or creative; it's braindead, just like Kurt was.
0790729652|4.0|Ok, first off this is an ok movie. It doesn't live up to Superman or Spider-man but it's still good. But if you're thinking of buying this, wait untill next year when WB releases the SE DVD of this movie.
B0000C1733|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers music has always been influential to the rock world. This CD includes most of their best and most memorable songs such as: \\"Under the Bridge\\", \\"Otherside\\", \\"Scar Tissue\\", and \\"Higher Ground\\", among other great songs. The album not only has most of their best songs but, it ALSO has brand new songs like; \\"Fortune Faded\\" and \\"Save the Population\\", which have extremely catchy tunes that make the album all the more worth while. If you love the Red Hot Chili Peppers as much as I do, or if even if you're not a fan yet, buy this album, and I KNOW you will be hooked!!
B000003N7K|5.0|It's just one of those timelss recordings where everything went right....flowing but delicate piano, restrained but tasteful percussion, and a voice and horn so sexy and powerful.<br />Just buy it.
0140177396|5.0|This is a straightforward tale told in simple straightforward language about the love (brotherly) and dreams of two men, George and the simple Lennie. It's a beautiful story and few written can equal it.
B000067CPX|4.0|This album is beautifully made. Brilliant drumwork, great bass, INSPIRATIONAL guitars and melodic singing, and superb production. The Chilli Peppers certainly have come a long way, but this album does have some grating flaws. These flaws are best encompassed by the only truly awful song on this disc: Warm Tape. For a start, with the exception of the title track, each song has no change in beat or tempo, and as such it does sometimes get very boring. <br />Coupled with the album's biggest flaw, the lyrics, I found myself skipping songs for the first time ever while listening to a Peppers album. Someone needs to tell them that they don't absolutely HAVE to force every single line of song to rhyme. Them doing this leads to some really cheesy moments like &quot;can I pet your wolverine/on the day my best friend died/ I could not get my copper clean&quot;, &quot;show love with no remorse/climb onto your seahorse&quot; and &quot;I'm the rainbow in your jail cell/all the memories/of everything you've ever smelled&quot;. It just sounds so goddamned forced, so I'm gonna have to take off one star to make up for it. <br />At times this album is a great listen, don't get me wrong, the tempo just gets boring sometimes, and the lyrics can be frankly embarrassing sometimes!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Larry - Cleveland<br />I saw Neil in Cleveland 3/11/04. He did not disappoint. Neil is the only artist who is willing to take chances for the sake of the art and for his beliefs. The stage show of Greendale was an enlightening accentuation of the album, a relevant statement about the state of our nation. I suspect detractors are only casual listeners who would be better off spending their time listening to Classic Rock stations and reading People magazine. NEIL STILL ROCKS!!!<BR>3/13/2004 6:43:17 PM
B000001IPL|1.0|For those of you who complain about Offspring going &quot;Too Mainstream&quot; with their later albums like Conspiracy of One and Splinter, those who call their most recent products &quot;Pop Music&quot;, has it ever ocurred to that the fact that they have better production and a larger budget has been used very well to disguise Dexter Holland's awful, out of tune singing that can be seen very prominently on the Smash album? How can anyone say that they'd rather have out of tune unedited singing than electronically enhanced singing that actually sound alright, however fake it may be?
B000068FUS|4.0|In an age where Shania Twain, a \\"country\\" flavored, booty shakin' pop (girl) has come to define Country, these boys are a breath of fresh air.  Obviously they are aiming to keep things real while attempting to explain the cultural significance of Sothern Rock in the 1970's for those of us who were either too young or too pretentious to get it the firt time round.  The albumn seems to jump back and forth between observations about the South & Lynyrd Skynyrd, and the influence these things had on the boys in DBT.  And to their credit they talk about these things in a \\"warts 'n all\\" style that helps paint a pretty clear, if often bleak, picture.  While they could probably have whittled this down to a very tight single albumn, the sheer scope of this work is pretty amazing.  The fact that they let people they know do the art work and the recording proves they're out to keep things real.  If you like Hank III, Steve Earle, or recent Johnny Cash, these boys'll definately grown on you after a couple of listens, just like Kudzu.........
0440238609|5.0|When I first read this book it was for a quick read.  I picked up The Golden Compass for a trip I had to make.  I thought it would be a good read.  Boy was I pleased.  The characters are beliveable and likable.  <br />I've heard other people say don't let children read this because it will upset their faith.  But I don't think that is true.  I know a lot of children who've read this book but still are faithful.  I mean if you have so little faith in you children teach about the religion and stop protesting books.  I personally liked the story about The Authority and the Angels.
B000068QVN|5.0|If you ever wanted to know what it was about Grand Funk Railroad that drove their fans wild, and the parents and rock critics crazy, it is all captured here during the tour of the most exciting and creative apex of their career--the year 1971. Undoubtedly, the selections from the basement tapes found for this collection are probably representative of the best versions of these songs as they were performed live. The weakest, perhaps being the first two, &quot;Are You Ready&quot; and &quot;Footstompin' Music&quot;. &quot;Are You Ready&quot; is a song that had sort of run its course by this time as a &quot;concert opener&quot;, and it really sounded as if the band was tired of playing it, as they sort-of, &quot;rushed it&quot; through. &quot;Footstompin' Music&quot;, on the other end, sounds like a jam that evolved out of an earlier song, &quot;In Need&quot;, and the band had only had it around for a couple of months when they decided to &quot;try it out&quot; on the crowd at Cobo Hall in Detroit in April--and, of course, would be the song that would soon overtake &quot;Are You Ready&quot; as the band's official opening number. GFR was one of those bands like Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath who believed in &quot;testing&quot; a new song on the road before they put it on an album, and it would be 6 months at least before they would record &quot;Footstompin' Music&quot; properly for the &quot;E Pluribus Funk&quot; album--for me, the one time that the song fully came together. The only thing that the earlier version lacked here was simply the right guitar, and I think guitarist Mark Farner knew that. that's not to slight the Messenger guitar, because it worked brilliantly on every other song here. But it just seemed to lack the &quot;OOMPH!&quot; in the guitar solo that switching to a Gibson SG would do for Mark later on &quot;E Pluribus Funk&quot;.<BR>But the thing that impresses me most about this collection is, indeed, the guitar playing of Mark Farner on this tour. Themore I hear his earlier work, the more impressed I am with him as a guitarist, and the more I am at a loss to understand why the critics slagged him for his guitar playing. It never really was bad, anyway, but it certainly got even better on this tour. He just flat-out put on a guitar clinic on some of these songs! Songs like &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;I'm Your Captain&quot;, and &quot;Get it Together&quot; show his great mastery of the &quot;wah-wah pedal&quot;, probably some of the best &quot;wah&quot; I've heard. Certainly, the &quot;wah-wah&quot; on this version of &quot;Paranoid&quot; sounds better than the &quot;wah-wah&quot; on the version from the &quot;Live Album&quot; a year earlier, and actually closer to the distortion on the studio version from the &quot;Red Album&quot;. Dunlop, or whatever brand Mark used, should be thanked for providing such great distortion pedals for this tour (I suppose, good enough to nick, as one fan Terry Knight scolded for trying to do, as you'll hear at the end of &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; from Shea Stadium.) What Mark's Messenger guitar lacked on the guitar solo on &quot;Footstompin' Music&quot;, was more than made up for on the guitar solos of &quot;Paranoid&quot;, &quot;Hooked On Love&quot;, &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, and &quot;Into The Sun&quot;. <BR>Another thing that this disc really brings more into focus about Grand Funk is how good they were at musical arrangements &quot;on-the-fly&quot;, for concerts. For example, how to play &quot;I'm Your Captain&quot; on tour with a more creative opening, and without an orchestra. Well, they simply open with Mel Schacher's bass riff from the song, and Mark joins in &quot;chicken scratching&quot; his guitar, and then, &quot;BAM!&quot;, he launches into the official opening riff. Then, they make the song a &quot;Closer To Home&quot; album medley, going into &quot;Hooked On Love' just before the bridge, and seguing from there into &quot;Get It Together&quot;. Not only brilliant, but an exciting way to keep everyone in the crowd happy! As for &quot;Into The Sun&quot;, they turned it into a &quot;show-stopper&quot;, adding three extra minutes of jamming, as an encore number for every concert in those days. There isn't a whole lot of difference, however, between this version of &quot;Into The Sun&quot;, and the one from the &quot;Live Album&quot; a year before, except that mark tries to solo a little more during the &quot;end-of-song&quot; jam. I always liked the studio version of &quot;Into The Sun&quot; from the &quot;On Time&quot; album as one of my favorite GFR songs, but I think they could have done a little more with it &quot;live&quot;. As they did on the &quot;Live Album&quot; from the previous tour, they basically took &quot;Into The Sun&quot;, originally a motown-ish &quot;James Brown&quot; rhythm number with a beautifully-melodic intro, and transformed it in concert into a metallic rhythm machine, making it louder and faster than it was on the first album. It sounds &quot;okay&quot; like that, but I think here is where GFR could have taken a lesson in &quot;Jamming 101&quot; from Led Zeppelin and the Grateful Dead, in that, they could have changed it up or &quot;tweaked&quot; the end-of-song jam to make it more interesting each time they performed it, and so that it doesn't end up with the same &quot;drone&quot; each time. After all, they changed &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; to where it sounded different than the version on the &quot;Live Album&quot; from the previous tour. Had they tried to experiment with &quot;Into The Sun&quot; the same way, they could have had a real &quot;stunner&quot; for a show ender every time.<BR>But generally speaking, this disc of GFR's 1971 tour serves as &quot;Exhibit A&quot; as to where GFR's reputation, or labeling, as a &quot;heavy metal&quot; band might have come from. They only approached the &quot;metallic heights&quot; a few times on their studio albums. But as a &quot;live&quot; band, when theyturned up the volume, they turned everything, even their most soulful numbers like &quot;Hooked On Love&quot; and &quot;Into The Sun&quot;, metallic. This disc is a must have for every GFR fan, or any music fan who simply wants to know what made GFR tick. This has been a missing piece of their legacy that has just now been put on disc, and can fill in the blanks for all those who couldn't get enough of the band's early material.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I enjoyed it, but things didn't really connect up for me.  I was too concerned with where the movie might be going to actually see that it was already there.  <BR>I now find this film to be brilliant, moving, and uncommon.  It establishes it's theme immediately and adds layer after layer as it moves along.  You'll read a lot of retellings of plot and descriptions of things people found comical.  These are all fine, but, to me, they miss most of what makes this film so special.  <BR>Okay, the film starts with a shot of Scarlett Johnasson's [behind]-and I can only guess what that means.  But then we cut to a beautifully shot and scored scene in which Bob (Bill Murray) wakes up in a taxicab as it cruises through the brightly lit streets of Tokyo at night.  He rubs his eyes, as if waking from a dream (or into one).  Amongst the unintelligible (to him) signage, he sees a large billboard of himself:  he is somehow an accepted part of this overwhelming landscape.  Then we get a close-up of a flashing neon sign with huge Japanese letters, as if it is announcing something absolutely germane to existence.  What does it say?!  Well, to people who can't read Japanese, it doesn't say anything.  That's the point.  No matter how urgent or spectacular the presentation, most everything we encounter in life has no inherent meaning.  This movie is filled with such images-and the fact that many of them reference the Japanese culture is incidental.  Every culture is filled with customs that seem odd or silly to those outside of that culture.  (One could easily argue that the present state of American television programming is just as absurd as the weird stuff that's on Japanese TV in the film!)  <BR>Amidst this landscape we have Bob and Charlotte, each trapped in a life that, for them, lacks depth.  By that I mean that they are unable at the present time to grasp with confidence onto anything \\"more than this\\"-that is, anything more than the surface of existence.  They may have the funds to stay in a wonderful hotel, but there is nothing intrinsically wonderful (or terrible) about their lives.  Their lives have basic comfort, but little else.  There is no joy in their careers, and they are both in marriages that have settled into passionless routine with people whose priorities lie elsewhere.  <BR>What Bob and Charlotte recognize in each other is themselves.  Charlotte searches for something that she can connect with (religion, tradition, culture, etc.); the film gives us many examples of her observing others going about their daily endeavors with zeal and/or devotion.  None of it is the right fit for her.  When she meets Bob, she discovers someone who has the same cross to bear, but is much further along in the journey.  \\"Does it get any better?\\" she asks, and his first instinct is to say, \\"No.\\"  It's this shared burden that makes it so touching when they are half-flirting, half-commiserating, and he sings to her, \\"Show me one thing more than this... There is nothing.\\"<BR>I'd better cut this short, but let me say that it's no surprise that a lot of the reviewers here have had strong, negative reactions to this film.  It's only right that so many should not \\"get\\" it; in fact, I'm shocked that the movie has found such a large audience:  at its deepest level, this is a movie for those of us who don't \\"get\\" most of what goes on in this world.
B0000WN0ZK|5.0|Michelangelo Antonioni's breathtaking masterpiece is without a doubt one of the all time greats(probably around #25-30 ever). It had almost become a forgotten gem until it finally got released on DVD. Nows a chance for everyone who says that they are film buffs to indulge in one of the best mind game movies ever. This is probably the second best art film ever, behind David Lynch's &quot;Eraserhead&quot; of course. The plot is not really important in the grand sceme of the movie. It is more about the arc of the main character, how he feels about his love life, career, and his place in society. The symbolism and imagery in the film is endless. Even though Blow Up has been analyzed and watched frame by frame by so many people, for so many years, I still doubt that anyone has discovered the true meaning of the film. But enough of the praise for the film, and on to the DVD. The quality is amazing. The colors that Antonioni chose so carefully are shown so clearly that they begin to bleed right into your head. You will be seeing colors and images from the film in your mind for weeks afterward, as I have. The sound is also great. The DVD is well worth the relatively low price. The commentary track is not as bad as everyone says, it is just that the author does not really take a stand on the films multiple meanings. But all in all, you can't say you know movies until you have seen Blow Up. And if you don't like it the first time, I recommend seeing it a second time. Little details become alot more interesting &amp; clear on second viewing. You will be treating yourself to a masterpiece.
B000002N3J|4.0|I purchased this cd on a family trip in Hershey Park at a K - Mart. I was going through a phase in which I was obsessed with Madonna and evn had a huge crush on her. Listening to this album, I realized that Madonna was more than just a worldwide sex symbol. She could sing about the softer side of love. \\"Something To Remember\\" tries to capture that side, and while it does make a valiant effort, it falls flat.<br />There are several things dragging it down. First, the packaging is misleading. It's said to be a collection of love songs. Well, with the exception of \\"Crazy For You\\", the songs here aren't really love songs. They aremore ballads. Yes, there's a difference between a love song and a ballad. Love songs are songs about the celebration of the right realtionship that you can snuggle up with your lover to. Ballads deal with pain, which is what the majority of songs here deal with. If they wanted a solid collection of love songs while weeding out the ballads, they should've added upbeat songs like \\"Cherish\\" (my favorite Madonna song), and even faster numbers like \\"Angel\\", \\"True Blue\\", and \\"Like A Prayer\\", songs that were not slow and soft but still celebrated the power and joy of \\"True Love\\". The songs here could've been put together by anyone with a cd burner and the complete Madonna catalogue. <br />I suggest that you get all of Madonna's albums up 1994's \\"Bedtime Stories\\" before buying this album. It's not a good way to be introduced to Madonna's music. It's a good album, but not great.
B00005T30L|5.0|At times watching the film i had moments where i felt like i could really relate and they made me quite sad,a fine drama with great comedic moments. Thora Birch's acting is superb, the characters are so believable that it almost feels real, and i would like to imagine they she is the same way in real life(i am not a big fan of her in american beauty,although it was a fine film) This film made me see Thora in a different light, and i  find her so incredibly sexy. Her non chalant attitude, her sarcastic and quirky remarks are hilarious. <BR>    Steve Buscemi is a great actor , one of my favorites, and he delivers in Ghost World He plays this role out so well, that i couldnt help but get depressed and try to sympathize with him, <BR>   i never have read the comic book, but after seeing this film i am gonna go check it out , i reccomend u go watch this movie , either renting or buying , it wont dissapoint!
B00005J6SZ|5.0|Although her 1983 self - titled debut was a hit, Madonn had to wait until December of 1984 before she was a superstar. When &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; reached # 1 and stayed there for 6 weeks, the world was ready to welcome a new pop superstar. 1985's &quot;Like A Virgin&quot; welcomed her into the world of music, knocking Prince's &quot;Purple Rain&quot; from # 1 after 24 consecutive weeks at the top. Yielding 5 top 5 singles, Madonna had arrived.<br />The album opens with its other massive hit, the bright and fun &quot;Material Girl&quot;, her tribute to Marilyn Monroe in a way. It remains one of the best '80s' pop songs. It also went to # 2, unable to unseat &quot;One More Night&quot; by Phil Collins. &quot;Angel&quot; (# 5) is a great and upbeat. Next comes the moment we've all been waiting for. From its heavy synthesized intro to its breathy close, the title track might as well be the best song of the 1980s', summing the decade up (in musical terms) in just over three minutes. &quot;Over And Over&quot; is a rapid - paved dance number sure to have you on your feet. Following is her soulful cover of Rose Royce's &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot; that is so beautiful, you can't help but wonder why they waited 11 years to release it as a single (a remixed version peaked at # 78 in 1996). &quot;Dress You Up&quot; was another big hit. It's not really anything special, but it's still a fun and harmless little pop song. &quot;Shoo - Be - Doo&quot; is a nice slower number. &quot;Pretender&quot; is a bit of a downer, but the album closes on a high note with &quot;Stay&quot;, which has a mesmerizing chorus.<br />&quot;Like A Virgin&quot; was the album that blew everyone away. Madonna had emerged from Detroit and proven herself a durable pop artist with moe than just a few tricks up her sleeve.
B00008S2VG|1.0|this CD is only a big noise ,some songs sound good ,but she need to think in some tracks easy ,like BEDTIME HISTORIES ALBUM ,really Im a fan of Madonna but this album ...sound like a PC-games soundtrack ... much noise! I hope something better in the next CD.
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is nothing short of amazing. I don't see how you can not like it- Amy Lee's voice blows you away and the lyrics have so much passion. It's unlike any other album I've ever heard... the songs are an amazing mix of rock and orchestra. Then there are the mournful, heartfelt songs &quot;My Immortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; which are so beautiful to listen to and the only instruments are the piano, strings, and Amy's voice. Anyone who believes that this CD sounds like it was written by a group of depressed 13 year olds couldn't be more off. There is such passion evoked throughout the entire album that you'll find yourself listening to it again and again.
B00004WF68|5.0|Led by the immensely talented Steve Winwood &amp; Dave Mason, the magnificent rock band Traffic said hello to the world with their 1967 debut album, &quot;Mr. Fantasy,&quot; a delicious psychedelic supper of flower-power pop/rock (the weird cover photo pretty much says it all about the feel of this album). The organ is prominent throughout, the sitar makes an appearance on a few songs, and there's also a few spoken passages as well. In other words, this is a totally far out record, man! Many Traffic classics populate this disc: the 60's pop of &quot;Heaven Is In Your Mind,&quot; the gorgeous ballad &quot;No Face, No Name, No Number,&quot; the Traffic signature rockers &quot;Dear Mr. Fantasy,&quot; &quot;Dealer,&quot; and &quot;Colored Rain,&quot; and the groovy instrumental &quot;Giving To You.&quot; The drunken ragtime piano number &quot;Berkshire Poppies&quot; is a real hoot, as are the psychedelic pop of &quot;House For Everyone&quot; (complete with wind-up clock intro) and the trippy &quot;Utterly Simple.&quot; Also, this new re-issue of &quot;Mr. Fantasy&quot; includes six bonus tracks of songs the band originally released purely as non-album singles, including more Traffic favorites like &quot;Paper Sun&quot; and &quot;Hole In My Shoe.&quot; Steve Winwood's voice, guitar &amp; keyboards are outstanding, Dave Mason's voice &amp; guitar are equally strong, Chris Wood plays a mean flute &amp; saxophone, and Jim Capaldi's drumming is superb. Traffic remain one of rock's greatest groups, and they couldn't have had a better intro than &quot;Mr. Fantasy.&quot; Great stuff!
B00018D44U|3.0|The album wasn't bad on first listening, but then I tried to rip it so I could listen on my MP3 player.  It failed after track one due to the &quot;Copy Controlled&quot; format that my CD came in.  It is going right back to where I bought it.  Perhaps Amazon can comment and highlight in the future when a CD is &quot;Copy Controlled&quot; because I won't be buying any more CD's that are set up with this built-in problem.  If Amazon's version of this album include EMI's copy protection, I recommend staying far away.
B00006V9A0|5.0|Are you a nirvana fan? Listen to this! You have to purchase this album. If you don't you're screwed up, visit a pyscian. Kurt Cobain is an idol. He did not commit suicide. You want you're proof visit justiceforkurt.com. Kurt, Dave, and kris make up the best band of the 90's or of all time. I also suggest you buy Nervermind by Nirvana their second and greatest of all time.Do not listen to the reviews that say negative stuff about Nirvana. Something is wrong with those people. I recomend you should buy this because of two great songs Rape Me and You Know You're Right. I guess that's it Nirvana fans. Laters.
B0000DD7LB|2.0|Britney has fully realized sex sells with her latest album. All the songs on this album speak to the hormones and not whether she really has talent. I don't think this harlet has any real talent besides her blonde hair and sexy body. What's the difference between a porno and a Britney Spears video? The porno has better music. lol
B000002GVO|5.0|'Hotel' is THE definative Eagles album. This is the disk you would play for someone that has never heard of the band.(right after you taught Gaamuki to speak English, and to leave his spear and shield in the corner.) There's not a bad track on it! The band covered a wide spectrum of feelings and experiences and never dropped the ball. <br />P.S. Banana-what?! Take your spear and go back to your tree.
0679311718|5.0|As many of the reviews describe, General Dallaire's well-written account of the Rwandan genocide is detailed, devastating and thought provoking on many levels.  I highly recommend it for anyone.  Period.<br />In addition to all of the information related to the genocide, there is another layer to his discussions that added even more interest for me.  As someone who has never been in the military, I never gave much thought to what it really means to be a soldier.  General Dallaire is a career soldier who comes from a family with a military tradition.  He is also a very intelligent and thoughtful man who has taken a lot of time to study not only the technical aspects of war but also its philosophical implications.  He speaks eloquently about the moral and ethical decisions that are implicit in this profession, and about what it really means to be a soldier.  His thoughts have sparked a new interest in me.  <br />I can, in addition, recommend an excellent documentary about his involvement in Rwanda, which is entitled &quot;The Last Just Man&quot;.  If you liked this book, and I can't see how you wouldn't, try to see the film (it has been broadcast on television).
B000005JA8|1.0|Yep, there's a definite smell of ass to this thing.  It took me awhile to place it, but there's no denying it - ass.
B000063DI9|5.0|This is one of Iron Maiden's best albums ever, and does only consist of good tracks.<BR>It starts of with &quot;Moonchild&quot;, then followed by &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;(One of Maiden's best songs), continued by &quot;Can I Play With Madness?&quot; (Another goodie)...<BR>The fourth track is &quot;The Evil That Men Do&quot;, it's good too. After comes &quot;Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son&quot;(just awesome!!), and then &quot;The Prophecy&quot;, wich also is a great song.<BR>&quot;The Clairvoyant&quot; comes after, and the lyrics are true... Finally, &quot;Only The Good Die Young&quot;, wich is completely OK.<br />If you ain't got this one, buy it!
B0001I55OC|1.0|The book \\"Timeline\\" is a really awesome and fascinating book about the whole concept of time travel, even if it is too far fetched for it to ever become a reality. I was amazed at the books concept and wondered how they would be able to adapt it to the big screen.<br /> Sadly, whatever was good about that book is thrown right out the window when on the big screen adaptation. This movie just soils the fun of the book and the result is a totally atrocious and absolutely laughable stinker of a movie. This movie in fact feels almost nothing like the book, not that I was expecting a whole lot to be taken out of the book and placed onto the movie but even when looking at it from a non-reader, this movie is just plain awful.<br /> The acting by almost all of the cast is hollow and the directing is just lame. In fact, I haven't seen a movie that was so badly miscast like this in many years, at least since \\"Batman & Robin\\" from years back which was also awful in it's own right. \\"Timeline\\" is one of the prime examples of how they could take a great and amazing book with an awesome concept and rob it of all of it's meaning with a really mindless mess of a movie and ruin the book's legacy.<br /> While it's far from being one of the worst movies of all time, that belongs to \\"Dumb and Dumberer\\" and \\"Gigli\\", \\"Timeline\\" is one of the weakest movies of 2003.<br /> Tell Paramount and Company to go back to the movie studio and start all over on this movie because I refuse to accept this as an adaptation of the Crichton Novel.<br /> A total disappointment. Do not waste your time on this movie.
B0000844I8|4.0|I have to hand it to science fiction; it is one of the few genres that can have mediocre acting and still be a good movie.  Stargate's story is the reason for its success.  The movie tells the story of a race of aliens that used (notice how I did not say built) an interstellar portal, called a Stargate, in order to bring humans to a new planet for slave labor.  This all happened during the time of ancient Egypt, so there is a disticnt Egyptian flavor throughout the film, which I found very intriguing.  In 1928, archeaologists find the Stargate and are baffled by it.  In the present day, the Stargate is in the hands of the United States Air Force, and they hire an Egyptologist named Daniel Jackson (James Spader) to decipher the markings on the gate.  Jackson is somewhat infamous in his field, because he denies that humans built the pyramids.  He believes that it was done by aliens, but he has no proof to back it up.  The Air Force also brings in an old retired colonel, named Jack O'Neil (Kurt Russell) in order to \\"supervise\\" the project.  Once Jackson gets the Stargate operational, a team, led by O'Neil and including Jackson for scientific purposes, goes through the gate and ends up on a planet in a galaxy far far away (sorry, I couldn't help myself).  On the planet, they encounter other humans who still speak ancient Egyptian as well as a race of humanoid aliens who are keeping the men as slaves.<BR>The story is very inventive and it is what finally saved the movie for me.  Spader did okay in his role, but Russell seemed to have two modes: angry and sarcastic.  One thing that I didn't understand was that Russell gets top billing, but the movie is essentially about Spader's Jackson.  Also, I didn't like Ra (Jaye Davidson), the leader of the aliens.  He was a good character, but he was so creepy just because he looks so much like a woman!  I could barely look at him it was so disturbing.  But besides these two things, Stargate is a great movie.  The effects are great,and as I have already stated, the story is amazing.
B000000OAH|4.0|Jazz by Queen is an often overlooked album, chock full of decent material. This may be due to the fact that, unlike some of their previous releases like Night At The Opera or Queen 2, this album doesn't follow any concept or theme and any track sequence really could have had the same effect as any other. This is merely a collection of songs that don't hold together as a cohesive beginning-middle-end listening experience. That said, the songs themselves are great. <BR>  With their previous 'News Of The World', Queen began to move away from the conceptual 'music hall' orchestrations and into their 'hedonistic' period: leather, disco, pop culture. Jazz consolidates this direction, but is also a bit of a transitional album as well. This is also the very last of Queen's studio albums with 'no synthesizers'. They still cover a lot of styles and variety by way of somewhat 'mock' genres(like Bohemian Rhapsody did for opera, Somebody To Love did for gospell or My Melancholy Blues did for lounge jazz). There is also still a good dose of ridiculousness, pomp and novelty as well, as we can expect from Queen. The songs:<br />MUSTAPHA - a Middle Eastern sounding track and bizarre opener. Not sure if Freddie singing in a real Arabic language or just a made-up collection of effective words(like 'Scaramouche' etc in Rhapsody).<br />FAT BOTTOMED GIRLS - Brian's song in a sloppy southern rock mode, guitar driven and one of their classic hits.<br />JEALOUSY - similar in style to piano-driven ballads found on earlier Queen albums like Day AT The Races. A lovely song, lovely harmonies.<br />BICYCLE RACE - pomposity to the ever lovin' core. Here is Queen back in campy mode, another classic hit which shows up on any greatest hits disc they ever rerelease. <br />IF YOU CAN'T BEAT THEM - an upbeat John Deacon one, not too unlike 'Need Your Loving' or 'You And I' from other albums. Not particularly outstanding but Queen enough for me.<br />LET ME ENTERTAIN YOU - Freddie's homage to the debacherous lifestyle they had gotten themselves into, and another classic rocker. Also I notice I liked Roger's drum sound on this album/period. <br />DEAD ON TIME - another rocker, an unremarkable heavy-ish track which I suppose balances out the more harmony-laden ones and ballads, but again, Queen enough for me.<br />IN ONLY SEVEN DAYS - another John one. Nice, singer-songwritery song about meeting someone and falling in love while on vacation. Warm, summer-y guitar and harmonies.<br />DREAMERS BALL - another Brian blues one, surpassing his lame 'Sleeping On The Sidewalk' from the previous album. This time a lazier, slower blues.<br />FUN IT - a lot of people hate this track, I actually dig it. Queen begins their love affair with funk/disco here, with Freddie and Roger trading lead vocals. Usually Queen singers handle all their lead vocals on their own tracks or one song at a time. Rarely did they ever sing duets or lead vocals together. Here was one occasion they did. Fun it.<br />LEAVING HOME AIN'T EASY - Queen in Supertramp mode on this one. Brian May is lead vocals. Similar to 'In Only Seven days' in atmosphere and execution.<br />DON'T STOP ME NOW - one of Queen's classic pop rock songs, a feel-good classic which should be on any fan's top ten Queen songs list. <br />MORE OF THAT JAZZ - a heavier, driving Roger song in which he sings on. It's actually ruined by the the abrupt appearance of collage 'soundbites' of most of the tracks over the course of the album, probably spliced in to give the false sense of Jazz being a conceptual album. That trick really did the album no favors. It still sounds incohesive as a whole, but the individual songs are decent to great.<br />The bonus 'rap' remixes added on are really unnecessary and really should be taken as just some fun .. slapped on at the end of the disc as icing on your cake.<br />Jazz is a classic album, one that you need.
6305291489|5.0|I would have given this movie 10 stars if I could.  I hate the original, but this movie is my all time favorite.  Lindsay Lohan is the most charming and talented actress out there.  I'm sure she will win an oscar one day, I would have given her an oscar for this movie easly.  This movie has so many charming details, like the handshake between Annie James and her butler Martin.  The casting is beyond perfect, I praise Disney in remaking their original The Parent Trap and Freaky Freday.  DO NOT RENT THIS MOVIE, BUY IT ALL COSTS.
B000002R48|4.0|Funny thing about this CD - it was recorded where I grew up (Albany, NY) for probably a 'song', and what a great CD it is!!! Cannot be compared to anything DT has done since - don't even try - this is a 'fans' or 'folk who like the Queensryche sound of the 80's' CD - period.  After playing Images and Words right after it, you may not even think it is the same band!  <br />HOWEVER, the sound of early DT comes through - the prog-metal precise-ness of Petrucci, Portnoy, Moore and Myung.  Sounds like they may have been doing something to please the public at the time, as there were other bands that had a 'similar' sound - but the intenseness of all of their effort cannot be ignored here...<br />DT today is something to be reckoned with - their shows are unreal, and their CD's deliver great music.  I have everything they ever did, but still find this CD a great listen and a great perspective to a band that worked hard to get where it is today, in a world seemingly ruled by the latest trend.  DT is rarely heard on the radio cuz their songs are more than 4-5 minutes, but go figure that one!!  They played the heck out of 'Hey Jude', didn't they?  Well, I guess a Beatles to DT comparison may be out of whack, but I cannot believe that you can hear LOTS of 3-4 minute NUMETAL at any time on the more 'progessive' stations...have written to them, and they cop the excuse 'no one asks for DT'.<br />Back to this CD - a gem, especially for folk that are already DT fans...a slice of history that they probably want to forget, but never will, as some really great stuff came out of their really early daze..that they still play today!!!
0812548094|3.0|Many people that read Terry Goodkind's first book in The Sword of Truth Series give up in the beginning.  Goodkind is a decent writer but honestly, I think declaring him one of the best fantasy writers today speaks words about how bereft the fantasy genre is of talented authors. I almost gave up on book one myself and I'm glad I didn't because in the end, I enjoyed the book and had a merry time reading about the adventures of Richard, Kahlan, Zed, Chase and others.  I purchased book two the day after completing the first book and initially, I zipped through it like I did book one but something happened along the way.  Stone of Tears isn't a bad read but it just didn't pull me in like the first book.  I think the biggest point of tension in book one was Richard and Kahlan's relationship and now that they're together (sort of) and know each other so well, their characters don't have the same zip they used to.  I don't mind long reads but I feel like Goodkind could shorten all his books by AT LEAST a hundred pages.  In book two, I started feeling like I was slowly churning along and I stopped reading about midway through after reading Ada's (Is that her name?) background story. I won't ruin it for any potential readers but the story about her split from her ex-lover smacks hard of that typical Goodkind nonsense that he sometimes uses as origins or motivation for his characters.  If you enjoyed the first novel, I'd give the second one a try.  After all, enough people have enjoyed this series to allow it to continue to book eight, nine or whatever it's on now; but in my opinion, if you want a new fantasy series, check out George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire Series or Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series first if you haven't already.  Jordan's series gets slow in the end but the first few books are much better than The Sword of Truth Series.  Overall, Stone of Tears is a decent read but not everyone will enjoy it.
B000067CPX|1.0|Tepid.  Insipid.  Uninspired.  These are just a few of the adjectives that could describe this CD.  Only the title track is worth a repeat listening.  The rest is vile tripe.
B000066NW0|4.0|OK, so it ain't punk, but then again neither is 'London Calling' ('Sk8er Boi' is more punk than 'Lost in the Supermarket' and 'Train in Vain' combined). 'Sk8er Boi', 'Mobile', and 'Unwanted' are the best songs on this CD. The filler is pretty good, but there is a good amount of it.
0446677450|5.0|I have been a money manager for many years, both for insitutions and individuals.  THis book was recommended to me because of its down-home approach to looking at money and how wealth is accumulated.  I expected to be completely unimpressed as I have an MBA from a top school and have been in the financial world for a long time.<br />But if you are confused about money, or the key differences between the way entreprenueurs and simple job holders look at the world, get this book.  I highly recommend it.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|When I got this DVD in the mail I knew I was going to enjoy it. The animation, the music, everything about this anime rocks. Any fan of Leiji Matsumoto, Daft Punk,(or both for that matter)should definately pick up this DVD.
0743455967|5.0|I am an aspiring fiction writer myself and I figured I love Stephen King's writing let learn me from him. Basically, he tells you exactly what a writer needs to get going and stay on track. The part about reading alot is definitely true but be careful not to turn reading into work. Reading should be a fun learning experience. If you are not writing anything, King tells you that you are no writer; face it you are fooling yourself. Be honest about what you really want. Stephen King doesn't hold back. He really kicks slackers butts! Watching tv all time? King asks how many episodes of a tv program must you watch to finally be fulfilled?! Well.... I enjoyed this book very much. <br />I recommend this book to all upcoming writers. However don't get discouraged by King's blunt style. He means well.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I want to dissapoint some people but this album is double as strong as toxicity. It is made in a very strange original style and it differs and that's what is so good about it. the music and lyrics are much deeper and have much more thinking put to it. it is nice intelligent metal.
B0000029LG|5.0|The title, HIStory, fits this album.  On the first disc, it shows his past hits that have put him in the music stratosphere.  It is a great collection of the most recognizable hits of the music era!  On the 2nd disc, it shows all of his emotions.  You have songs that express great anger to songs that express a sadden man to a man who Just wants to express love throughout the world.  I think with this disc, he had a lot to say.  I think he spoke well about the turmoil he suffered in the past. And I truly Believe this collection of songs speak well on his current situation! When you Listen to this 2nd disc, I want you to listen very closely to the songs.  Listen to the messages in these songs. Someday, we may all be in a place where we may feel the same way he felt and feels now. Mike always said he doesn't sing a song if he doesn't mean it. That should tell you something! Like I said, the man had some stuff inside that he had to let out. I know we all got stuff to get out of our system sometime.
B000001ESN|5.0|i would have to say that this album is in the top 3 rush albums of all time. this, hemispheres, and moving pictures i believe are the band's best work. the one-two punch of spirit of radio and freewill is incredible. everything here is good though, including the extremely progressive jacob's ladder, and the dynamic epic natural science. for a starting point, it's either this or moving pictures.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This album is definitely My favorite!!!  All the tracks on this album are hot and fresh to this day!  You have the powerful Don't Stop til You Get Enough to the soulful and sexy Rock With You.  If you love to dance, then you will enjoy the funky dance tracks on the album.  For those who love to get in the \\"mood\\", you have some midtempo love songs that will help you enjoy your romantic evenings.  I definitely recommend anyone who does not own a copy of this album to purchase a copy!
0385510438|5.0|\\"The Last Juror\\" is neither \\"The Firm\\" nor \\"the Pelican Brief\\", nor is it similar to \\"A Time for Killing\\" which shares &quot;Juror's&quot; Ford County, Mississippi, setting.  But it is a powerful novel in its own right, combining the elements of classic Grisham courtroom drama with a nostalgic study of life in rural Mississippi.  The main story is of the brutal rape and murder of a young widow.  The alleged murderer, Danny Padgitt, is the youngest son of the wealthy but reclusive local gentry.  Protagonist Willie Traynor, Memphis-born and Syracuse-educated, migrates to Clanton and, with the help of a rich aunt, buys the dying local newspaper.  So while the story is ostensibly one of the crime and subsequent retribution, it is also a poignant tale of the decade-long relationship that develops between Traynor and \\"Miss\\" Callie Ruffin, matriarch of a poor but proud black family of Clanton.  Just as the Big Brown River and its creeks and sloughs wind through the meadows of Ford County, Grisham's prose meanders through sub-plots, anecdotes and banalities of the small-town south.  Grisham is in no hurry to get to the climax  - indeed the recipe for Miss Callie's pot roast is hardly a page-turner.  But the pace of the prose is a conscious and necessary element of the author's message, and seemingly unconnected events eventually tie together to complete the portrait of Grisham's South.  And if the weighty topics of civil rights and Viet Nam are axes Grisham chooses to grind, he treats them with sensitivity and respect, and is neither heavy-handed nor judgmental in his delivery.<br />The reader looking for a thriller along the lines of Grisham's fine earlier works may be disappointed, but it would be vastly unfair to dismiss this novel.  \\"The Last Juror\\" is thoughtful and thought provoking literature; an example of a fine American story teller broadening his scope and delving deeper into familiar topics.
B000003TA4|5.0|Or perhaps, more accurately, in the defence of a legend.<br />To all those that would doubt Nirvana's legacy: Nevermind went eight times platinum since its release.  It rose to #1 on the Billboard charts, taking the place of Michael Jackson and &quot;Dangerous&quot;.  Kurt Cobain and Nirvana became the most powerful and influencial group in the world.<br />And for good reason: Kurt Cobain's songs reach a level of truth and reality, depressing and dark as it is, that few others have ever managed to achieve.  Those that would call Kurt a &quot;coward&quot; for taking his own life obviously have no idea of what he went through during his tragically short life: his parents' divorce and frequent fighting, the loss of three uncles who all committed suicide, his father's remarriage, being ejected from home after home and living, among other places, in his car (though never under a bridge, as &quot;Something in the Way&quot; says).<br />Kurt Cobain was possessed of a raw talent that shaped rock as we know it.  And while Nirvana did not CREATE grunge, they are the most known group of the name, since the release of Bleach.  &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; was NOT a song Kurt hated at first, but came to hate.<br />What must be understood is that Kurt had a lot of problems - starting and ending with long-term, untreated chemical depression and his addiction to drugs (used, in part, to try and ease his own inner pains).  He came to hate &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; because everyone loved it, and he was sick of playing it.<br />Cobain once wrote &quot;If you read, you'll judge&quot; on the cover of one of his journals.  And the phrase rings truest with those who judge him wrongly.  I encourage everyone, Nirvana fan or not, to read Kurt's biography, &quot;Heavier Than Heaven&quot; - and perhaps then you will finally understand the truth behinh Kurt Cobain and Nirvana.<br />And maybe you'll respect them.
B00012QM9K|2.0|Schindler's List is truly one of the few modern movies that is classic, that truly shows what film-making should be. I have waited for this movie to be released on dvd. The movie is great, a film that everyone should see, once you can open up the special edition. It took me 5 minutes to figure out how open the plastic case. I almost broke it twice. The gruff that some are making about it being a flipper disc, well it reminds me of playing records. There is a certain nostalgia in having to flip it over, but trepidation in scratching the new dvd in removing it from the case. You receive some interesting paraphenalia: a book of pictures from the film with background material about Spielberg making it; a pamphlet that states the same information in said book with an envelope for fund-raising for the Shoah Foundation; a piece of the actual film, though how limited red-coat girl is left for the gods; and included with the movie, the soundtrack. So basically, you're spending 60 bucks for a $19 dollar movie and a $15 dollar soundtrack with some fluff thrown in. Buy both instead of this. I now wish I did.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|Absolutely beautifull is the phrase that springs directly to mind. Enigma evolves again, and so majestically it's nearly impossible for me to describe the experience AND do the entire piece justice at the same time! SO instead....<br />My favorite Enigma album (allthough i love them all) was definately The Screen Behind The Mirror. It was a wonderful departure and an amazing acomplishment, and i'm happy to say, it looks like Voyageur is yet annother step in the right direction for the evolution of Enigma.<BR>So far i don't love it as much as TSBTM overall, but it shares the common Enigma ability to grow on you and overwhelm you over time and it definately has the relaxing, spiritual feeling that Mr.Cretu has fine tuned over the years.<br />Big thumbs up, at least for those who have a mind of their own!
B00018D44U|4.0|As wonderful as the great Norah is, this album is a grain of sand compared to the wonderful, jazzy COME AWAY WITH ME. On CAWM, all of the tracks had their own different beat and sound to them. It was one of those albums where all of the tracks are amazing. With this one, most of the songs have the same instruments and sound to them. Nonetheless, it's a great album. A few key tracks are &quot;What Am I To You?&quot;, &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot;, &quot;Carnival Town&quot;, &quot;Toes&quot;,&quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;, and a few more(I haven't listened to the whole CD a lot; I just got it). Bottom line:not as good as Come Away With Me, but still well-worth your money.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|First off, for those of you who don't know, the background of the films is this: there are two major races on earth - humans and mutants.  Humans are us, basically.  Mutants are folks who are born with a x-factor in their genes which gives them superhuman powers - reading minds, turning things to ice, healing, creating storms, etc.  Due to the mutants' exceptional powers, humans tend to be afraid of them.  Not all mutants are bad, but those that are are nearly unstoppable, and that is incredibly frightening for American and others who are used to safety and security.<br />While the first movie deals with &quot;the good mutants&quot; (led by Xavier) versus &quot;the bad mutants&quot; (led by Magneto), the second movie puts a real twist on this.  Here, one human (Stryker) acts as a mastermind to rid the world of mutants.  Thus, the great mutant minds now need to work together to stop his efforts.<br />The reasons why I enjoyed this film are pretty similar to why I enjoyed the first film.<br />1.  The man Xavier(played masterfully by Patrick Stewart)embodies every ideal we hope for in fellow man.  Though wrongly persecuted, he uses his incredible powers &amp; understanding for good rather than revenge.  <br />2.  The relationship betweem Xavier and Magneto (played equally masterfully by Ian McKellen).  This complex friendship and opposition of equals is fascinating...and rare in epic films.  Magneto is everything that Xavier is except that he is shrewder than Xavier and believes the solution to their troubles lay in wiping out humans.  <br />3.  The fact that the whole set-up is laced with social commentary.  Most of these themes are overt and are predictable - anti-war, tolerance, the impact of evolution.  Generally, I despise preachy messages.  However, here you can understand why the humans are afraid of the mutants, but you also see the vulnerability of the mutants.  <br />4.  I thought Nightcrawler's character development added some spiritual depth to the film.  He quotes from the Bible and speaks of angels and sin...all the while looking like a little devil with his black tail.  This adds the involvement of the heavenlies into a situation that is beyond our control.<br />5.  The action, the cast of characters, the cinematography were all great.  There are some flaws with the logic of the plot, but it wasn't too critical to me.<br />As for performance analysis of the stars, how much they stuck to the comic books, and plot flaws, I will leave that to more able reviewers than myself.  But, as a regular ol' movie watcher, I very much enjoyed the journey to this world the 2nd time round.  And I do hope they make another movie...but only if they can keep up this quality.
006054094X|5.0|Firstly I enjoyed this book and feel it deserved 5 stars from me, despite the fact that I don't entirely agree with Menzie's findings.<br />It doesn't take too much reading of this tome for the reader to realise that Menzies has spent a seriously long time researching this book. Indeed he offers the fact that it took him over 12 years to compile. It is not time wasted.<br />Menzies covers each of the Chinese Naval Captains in turn, theorizes about their exploits based on what information he could find, what information fit his story and finally what information he could deduce. Whilst I'm sure he was wide of the mark with a number of his theories, the sheer weight of evidence would tend to show that maybe, just maybe, Menzies is on to something here.<br />Until a proper wreck/carved stone is uncovered/ discovered, we probably won't know just how right Menzies was. An interesting read.
B00005LMBK|5.0|I love Gorilaz they ment so much to me with there song &quot;Clint Eastwood.&quot; I got so into them and nowIjust addicted I drew some pictures of them too.They're great with their mix of Punk,Rock,and Hip-Hop.I dedicated my voice to sound like the music.And after so much practice I finally did it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Could this possibly be a bad movie? <br />No it could not. <br />Bad movies do not inspire the kind of love that those who love it (including critics and the most discerning filmgoers) have for it. Nor do they - at the same time - inspire the negative feelings that others have for it.<br />What it is, is a highly personal movie, a film that's different from what some people expect. And what a rare thing that is.<br />I know that connections can get you a lot in the Hollywood film industry. But what connections can't get you is talent. Sofia Coppola has that in spades. And one of the most fascinating things is that it's a very feminine talent, very unlike that of her father. The world of &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; and &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is certainly not that of her Dad. It is at the opposite extreme from his occasional bombasticism and operatic sweep.<br />Coppola is a miniaturist. A painter of emotions. Like &quot;21 Grams&quot; although in an entirely different way, this is a film that takes effort on your part. It's a movie for people who can understand genuine emotion instead of the ersatz and fake feeling that we're usually spoon fed. COmpare it with Eric Rohmer, if you know who he is. Murray and Johansson are both superb. Lance Acord's cinematography does miracles on a low budget.<br />It's funny about Tokyo, and its characters, but also loving. There isn't any meanness in it. <br />I loved the scene where Bob let his morals slip and woke up wondering what had happened. I loved being able to laugh at that, and also knowing that it was - in a small way - heartbreaking. And yet, she has no reason for her heart to ache. It does anyway. And that's how life is.<br />For those who bring up &quot;prejudice&quot; issues, I say get a life AND a reality check. Bill Murray is over six foot tall. As someone who has been to Asia I can tell you that, yes he is going to tower over a lift full of average height Japanese. He towers over Sofia Coppola in the interview on the DVD. That's hardly being prejudiced against Sofia Coppola.<br />This is a film for grown-ups, in a movie-going world with all too few such films. Looking at some of these reviews it seems there are all to few grown-ups too, whatever their chronological age.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I'm so sad that there's such apathy and ignorance directed at this absolutely gorgeous cinematic gem.  I rarely care for characters as I did for Charlotte and Bob Harris.  <br />Bill Murray was almost always on the verge of tears during his solitary moments or moments with Japanese PR people, but his soul glowed with life when Charlotte was with him.  I couldn't believe I was watching such a subtly beautiful performance from Bill Murray--even though I do think he's a damn good actor and I've always loved him and most of his movies.<br />Two \\"soulmates\\" found each other in a strange sea of people they cannot relate to whether it's the people of Tokyo, their spouses, or their life, they found something magical in each other.  If you've ever encountered someone special in your life, you'll most likely relate to the bond you feel with someone in the face of adversity or loneliness.<br />That's why I can't believe the absolutely dopey reviews to this movie about boredom.  Can't people watch a movie without the couple jumping into bed immediately or the bangs of explosions?  I enjoy those types of movies too, but this movie is about relating to each other, intimacy (real intimacy, not sex), and some damn funny humor thanks to aforementioned Bill.  Perhaps the views expressed here are indicative of the sad state of our society and I find *that* depressing.  I also find the negative, non-constructive reviews boring.<br />The movie, however, I find exhilirating and life-affirming.  Thank you Sophia Coppola, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and the whole crew (and Japan!) for this AMAZING movie!!!
B00008WG3U|2.0|I really didnt like this CD that much. Yes, there are a few really good songs here and there, like Franco UnAmerican and Seperation of the Church and Skate but its most definetley not worth paying 15 bucks for. The whole thing except for two or three songs is about how much of a dumbass George Bush is. Now I dont support Bush or anything. I just dont think its very exciting to hear someone complain about Bush for 30 something minutes. Maybe thats because Im only 15 and I dont care about politics that much. Or maybe its just because Im a Canadian. I dunno, I just know I found this a total bore. I mean, in the CD booklet, Fat Mike writes a page and a half about how much he hates Bush. Then he makes his CD enhanced and complains some more. Then he makes a music video or two against America and Bush. Then he includes this video about the election and how Bush shouldnt have won it. Plus, he tells us to go to PunkVoter.com every two seconds. And once you finally listen to the CD, you hear even MORE of the same complaining. Its got to be one of the most boring CDs Id ever listened to. To me, its like a New Found Glory CD, simple and repetitive, except theres no mention of girlfriends. I still like NOFX and all but this was a MAJOR disapointment. For me anyway. Dont buy this CD, unless you're VERY interested in politics or you hate Bush as much as Fat Mike does. And if you're new to NOFX, get So Long and Thanks For The Shoes instead. You'll be glad you did.
B000068IEU|3.0|Many horror fans consider &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; a major cult classic, a movie that changed forever the very conceptions of the genre. Made in the early 1970s on a shoestring budget, the movie boasts several memorable performances, gritty urban set pieces contrasted with scenes shot in peaceful woods, gruesome violence, and teeth gritting psychological torture. If praise for &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; rested solely upon these merits, the movie would differ very little from other cult classic shock-o-ramas like &quot;I Spit on Your Grave,&quot; or &quot;The Hills Have Eyes.&quot; What makes the film a cut above the rest, if you can say that without groaning, are the filmmakers involved in the project. None other than Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham wrote and lensed this motion picture. Craven, as even non-horror fans know, went on to worldwide success with the &quot;Nightmare on Elm Street&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; franchises. Cunningham, less known outside the world of slasher cinema, was the guiding light behind the first (and best) &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film. &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; was the first real project for both men. The movie made a killing at the box office in the days when filmmakers could still distribute films to small theater chains.<br />The plot is ghastly in its simplicity. Two attractive young girls, Mari and Phyllis, plan on heading into the city to have some fun. Once there, they unfortunately approach an escaped convict in order to procure some drugs. The guy, some wild haired loony heroin addict referred to as Junior, sweet talks the girls up to an apartment where his compatriots are hiding. These escapees are desperate people--there's the leader of the gang, the sadistic thug Krug Stillo (David Hess), the razor thin psycho Fred &quot;The Weasel&quot; Podowski, and Sadie, the gang's moll. All four of these outcasts are fugitives from the law, but cannot help planning further egregious crimes when they catch sight of the two girls. They end up driving the hapless gals out into the woods where the gang proceeds to mentally and physically torture them. It's not necessary to go into specifics about the horrible deeds perpetrated on these two nice looking young ladies except to say it's pretty horrible. Craven and Cunningham even show some of the more objectionable scenes up close in vivid color (and outtakes on the disc provide an even closer view of the general nastiness). What is of interest takes place after the gang disposes of their victims. You see, Mari's parents just happen to live on the edge of these very woods, and a very interesting exchange occurs when the gang happens to turn up on their victim's doorstep looking for shelter.<br />Mari's parents have been worried sick about their missing daughter. Since they are decent, upright citizens, they call in the local police (one of the cops played by Martin Kove, by the way) and file a missing persons report. Still, no Mari. When their daughter's killers show up posing as traveling salesmen, these decent folks invite them right in. They even feed the quartet of goons and offer to put them up for the night. Well, one thing leads to another, and it isn't too long before Mari's parents figure out these people bear the responsibility for their daughter's disappearance. Since they can't reach the bumbling cops, Mom and Dad decide to take matters into their own hands. The two sneak about the house setting up elaborate traps to ensnare the unwary murderers, things like setting up trip wires and slicking up the hallway floor with shaving cream. Mom takes an extra step I would rather not talk about on a public forum, but you get the general idea. The trap springs, chaos ensues, and several brutal murders take place as Mari's parents make the killers reap the whirlwind. And that, my friends, is a brief, highly censored summary of &quot;The Last House on the Left.&quot;<br />Does the film deserve its cult status?Are Craven and Cunningham worthy of the accolades heaped on this movie? Yes and no. Yes, the film does work well in achieving a sort of sleazy atmosphere through extreme violence and an over the top, menacing performance from Hess. However, I think the negatives outweigh the positives. First, the background music is wildly inappropriate for the film, with its twangy guitar and saccharine sweet lyrics. Second, the pacing drags horribly in spots, especially during the extended chase scenes between the gang and the two teenagers in the forest. Third, the entire subplot concerning the blundering cops feels wrong. The movie constantly cuts away from the unfolding nightmare to show the sheriff and his deputy running out of gas on the highway or trying to hitch a ride on a truck loaded with chickens. The movie plays these scenes for humor and it just doesn't fit; it's like putting Three Stooges' footage in a documentary about ethnic cleansing.<br />The DVD comes with a ton of extras, including a commentary from Craven and Cunningham, interviews with cast and crew, trailers, stills, outtakes, a widescreen picture transfer, and some other stuff. After watching these extras, it becomes apparent quite quickly that the movie succeeded primarily due to slick marketing rather than content. Still, I guess the film does make a statement about violence in America, and it did help Craven and Cunningham find other opportunities for their twisted imaginations. Where would we be, after all, without Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees (don't answer; it's a rhetorical question!)? Give it a go if you want to see an early influence on the genre, but I recommend you dive into H.G. Lewis if you want to see early films that made a bigger splash in the horror field.Are Craven and Cunningham worthy of the accolades heaped on this movie? Yes and no.

0060920084|1.0|This book proved to be a disappointment. Whereas Bryson was witty and entertaining in books such as A Walk in the Woods and In a Sunburned Country, he was simply profane and sarcastic in Lost Continent. His generalizations were based on first impressions and left me with the feeling that he wrote the book without taking the time to research the subject. He wrote with a definate bias. Bill should have stayed in England if he thinks so little of the USA.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|Why it fell down:<BR>The show starts off with an action packed sequence that draws you in immediately. But once you settle in, the action slows and the typical preachy moralistic American Sci-fi takes over and leaves a lot to be desired.  Like Star Trek in many ways but even more moralistic. You not only have the token black representative Male and Female, you get the token Latino female and the token Asian female, there's also a token white female thrown in as the ships mechanic.  Just to round out the set, there's the typical glamour white male captain/hero with a major moralistic conscience and the somewhat ugly and totally thick, gun-toting moron, there's also a highly educated doctor thrown in that does little for the show.  Despite the seemly forced mixed casting, all characters with the exception of the preacher and possibly the gun-toting moron, work well together to form a semi believable group thrown together without needless culture clashes.<P>It would be nice to see something different in casting like maybe a slightly unattractive Latino woman playing the leading role.  I guess American moviemakers aren't up to the challenge yet.    <P>There is a larger picture background in the series but it doesn't have the size or feel of larger picture backgrounds like in Babylon 5 or Stargate.  In short, I guess you could call it a small series about a few nobody's doing nothing much.<P>The more teckie bits:<P>Video<BR>The transfer is generally very good with the exception of a noticeable artefact on an early episode.  However I found a few errors most notable on the first disk where some shots are frozen for a second while the DVD player continues playing, this leads me to believe the was limited quality control on this release, possibly due to the relatively cheap price of the series.<P>Audio<BR>No problems detected, a nice catchy tune opens and closes each episode.<P>Overall<BR>If you have most other Sci-fi flicks already and like Star Trek then this may be wortha look.  Consider it after you have purchased all the Stargate/Starwars/Star-Trek series already on offer.

B00008LJFO|5.0|What can one say about this great band ? For all us people who are still touched by good rock music like Whitesnake , this has got to be the ultimate collection of a band , along side the &quot;Forty Licks - Best Of Rolling Stones&quot; . <br />This 2 CD collection is a good 2 and a half hour long tour down Whitesnake's greatest moments in their career. I could write endless comments about each song . All you have to do is let each song bring back good memories of when rock music was written based on emotions and passion !<br />I was fortunate enough to get to catch Whitesnake on their Silver Tour this last summer and all i can say is the David and the boys still have that magic ! <br />Few male rock voices can still bring tears to my eyes when you hear classics like &quot;Hear I Go Again&quot; or &quot;Is This Love&quot; and so on !<br />This is just an excellent collection .
0425170349|4.0|This was my first book from Tom Clancy.  I had played the video games and decided to see what all the fuss was about.  I have to say that I was very pleased by the read.  It moved along at a very quick pace following John Clark and Domingo Chavez.  <BR>Character development was great, not too indepth, but not so vague that you were left cold.  The action was great, and the suspense leaves you sitting on the edge of your eat.<BR>It shows how one slip up can break cases wide open in the FBI, new technology in the military, and how corupt human kind can be.<br />My only perks about this book are few: <BR>team RAINBOW comes of as beeing too good.  The first three missions they encounter go by too well without any problems.  All the men on both teams seem to supermen that can't be hurt, which takes away the humanity factor of them.  The ending is somewhat questionable as far as moral/legal issues arive, especially after the book pushes for legality and justice in many of its cases.  <BR>It would alos have been nice if a little more incite had been given to Team 1<br />other than that, a great read!
B00005JN1L|5.0|Really..I thought it was great.. Many people may not though..its a very twisted phycolgical (sorry bad speller..but you know what I mean) movie that is obviously Stephen King. I am a personal fan of Johnny Depp and Stephen King so this was a great movie for me. I strongly suggest going to see it. Don't worry I am not just saying this because it is a Johnny Depp movie and to prove this I am going to say that Once opon a time in Mexico would have to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. anyways go see it! I bet you will like it.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Shameless.<br />And yet, the cynic in me KNEW it was gonna happen SOMETIME.<br />I'm talking about a DVD that FORCES us to watch previews before the main menu or movie begin.<br />You've probably noticed that all DVDs force you to look at the &quot;piracy warning&quot; before the main menu comes up.  Some DVDs force you to sit through some short commercial for the movie company / TV network that spawned the film.  Hitting the &quot;MENU&quot; button during these opening moments produces no effect.<br />It's force-feeding, and we all know what force-feeders should do with their product.  We PAID for the thing.  We are the customers, the source of the money.  It's not appropriate for these people to waste OUR time, and abuse the source of THEIR income.<br />Vote with your dollars, people.  Don't buy this DVD.<br />&quot;Lost In Translation&quot; is the first DVD I've had the mispleasure to see, which pushes previews down our throats &amp; treats us like a captive audience of sheep.<br />Send a message back to the people who assembled this DVD.<br />Tell them &quot;No.  Not now, not EVER.&quot;

B0000B1OFL|4.0|Rating System:<br />1 star = abysmal; some movies need to be forgotten<br />2 star = poor; a total waste of time<br />3 star = good; worth the effort<br />4 star = very good; what a flick should be<br />5 star = fantastic; must own it and share it with others<br /><br />STORY: You know the story from the trailer...a team of thieves gets double-crossed by one of their own (Edward Norton) and they aim to get back at him<br /><br />MY FEEDBACK:<br />1) CHARACTERS - you don't get deep into any of the characters but that is not the point of this type of movie. Yet, there are little glimpses into each one that makes you like them well enough and even root for them<br /><br />2) PLOT - no real surprises but the over heist concepts were cool and the end result was satisfying<br /><br />3) ACTING - I love the casting in this movie. Seth Green is one of my favorite actors and he delivers some great lines in this movie.<br /><br />4) HUMOR - this movie had me laughing out loud more than some comedies. This was more of a comic-action flickk, which made it fun to watch in between the adrenaline chase scenes<br /><br />5) ACTION - good action scenes but not great. The opening chase scene in the Transporter is much better than the scenes in this movie<br /><br />OVERALL: I had my reservations because I hadn't heard a lot of positive about the movie. When my wife rented this from NetFlix I sat down to watch it with her and was pleasantly surprised. This is a FUN movie...watch it.
B00005JMNA|5.0|I think this movie is one of the best one's I have seen in a long time. Call me crzy but I've seen the movie five times already and it only came out about a month ago in theatres! Sort of a half remake, half, true story. I'll watch it again and again.
630157401X|4.0|Third time's a charm? Three's a crowd? These must have been the question plaguing the filmmakers and studio executives behind one of the greatest adventure series in movie history. But the lure of the charm, excitement, and most notably the rather large box office coin, of the previous two features could hold anybody down from this project. In the time since Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom, the three main men of the series had had a mixed bag of results away from the adventurous archeologist. Steven Spielberg was coming into his own amongst the critical elite with highly acclaimed, and multi nominated, features The Color of Purple and Tears of the Sun. George Lucas, with his predominantly acclaimed Star Wars series behind him for the time being, spent his time executively producing such under-appreciated features as Labyrinth and Willow. And Indiana Jones himself, Harrison Ford, had success in Witness and Working Girl but nothing for his own work. So was there any doubt that a third was demanded amongst not only two out of the three main men but the studio executives at Paramount as well? Whether that was the case or not, Indiana Jones was on his way once again to the big screen, possibly for the last time.<br />The story takes place nearly two years after the original feature film, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and three years after the Temple of Doom and places our hero, Indiana Jones, once again against the nefarious Nazi empire. Barely able to catch his breathe after another perilous mission for an ancient artifact; Indiana is whisked off, this time by multi-millionaire Walter Donovan to find an object not only important to the field of archeology but to the world itself. For over forty years, Indy's own father spent tireless hours researching and recording the many secrets that would lead to the discovery of the Holy Grail, the cup that Christians believed was used by Jesus Christ at the Last Supper and was also used to catch his blood at the time of his death. It is also believed that the Grail would bring immortal life to whoever drank from it, which has certainly gained the attention of Adolf Hitler, who dreams of a superior master race to rule the world, and he will do anything to achieve that dream. That is why it is important that Indiana get to the Grail first before the Nazis do but first he must find the man who was once in charge of the operation but has mysteriously disappeared, his own father. The story for Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade is probably one of the most noble adventure films in the genre and though this deals mainly with Christianity, Spielberg manages to keep the focus generally on universal beliefs and the concept of faith itself rather then the individual denominations. He guides the audience through several complex theories and beliefs but directs it out in such a way that even the most clueless of filmgoers will get a general idea of what is behind many of the main actions of the film.<br />As was said about the Temple of Doom in that the Indiana Jones series isn't afraid to switch supporting characters up and that it usually works well depending on their interaction with Ford remains true for this film. Not all work though, but the mass majority pick up the slack of the less potent additions to the cast. Harrison Ford dons the famous hat and whip once again and gives possibly the best performance in the series, if not on par with Raiders of the Lost Ark. This is all thanks to his absolutely amazing chemistry with Sean Connery, who is best known for his role as James Bond. The two talented performers play off each other so well that you would believe they were actually related. Sean Connery still shows that he has what it takes to be a commanding actor despite his old age. Though the feature contains a decent amount of humor within the material itself, additional comic relief comes in the form of Denholm Elliott as Dr. Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, who reprise their fantastic roles from the original. The only cast member that just doesn't seem quite right for the series is Alison Doody as Dr. Elsa Schneider, whose lines seem so drulled out and the performance on the whole being quite tacky. Whether that was the intention of the filmmakers or not may not be known but in either case it felt over-the-top and not in the good way that it could have been. It could have been Doody's performance or the role itself but whatever it was it didn't work at all.<br />Overall, if this is Indiana Jones' last go-around then it is marvelous one at that, mixing everything that made the series so enduring all into one consolidating effort. Historical background, religious content, and memorable characters all come together in a triumphant achievement from the brilliant duo of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.  There is little to complain about with this film but if anything was out of place, beside Alison Doody's performance, it had to be focus taken too much away from the meaning behind the Grail itself. Granted, praise must be given to Spielberg for the film's intention on keeping the audience centered on universal beliefs, but considering you are dealing with serious Christian content, it would have been nice to keep the focus on that but no big foul called for not doing that. Outside of a small dispute, Indiana Jones & the Last Crusade is an absolute must see and the wonderful thing about it is that there is no need to watch the previous two features in order to appreciate the magnificence of Spielberg's vision.

B000002UAU|5.0|I was 15 in the summer of 1967 when I purchased SGT. PEPPER&quot;S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND and it didn't leave my turntable for months.  In three short years the Beatles had gone from &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot; to being one of the most experimental (certainly the most influential) bands on the planet. The impact of this album still resonates today.  It frequently shows up at the top of music critics' polls of best albums of all time.  [The most recent was the December 2003 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone.&quot;] And for years I would have agreed with that assessment, and to some extent I still do--but with a caveat.  It is the Beatles most influential album, but REVOLVER, ABBEY ROAD and even RUBBER SOUL were the equal to SGT. PEPPER.<br />With that said, no music collection is complete (whether you're a Beatles fanatic or not) without a copy of SGT. PEPPER. It was their most technologically complex album, from the orchestration in &quot;She's Leaving Home&quot; to the sound effects snippets that link the songs.  The Beatles continued to experiment in the studio with songs like the masterful &quot;A Day in the Life,&quot; the hurdy-gurdy tape montage used in &quot;Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; and the Indian musicians used on &quot;Within You Without You.&quot;  Even the album cover was unique in that it was the first pop album to include printed lyrics for all the songs.<br />Back in the mid-Sixties, when the Beatles were releasing albums at the rate of three or four per year (when they would work in studio time between tours and personal appearances), it was unheard of to spend four months (129 day to be exact) to work on one album.  On Dec. 6, 1966, they began recording &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot; and on April 1, 1967, they complete &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts CLub Band (Reprise).&quot;  [The liner notes makes the following comparison:  In terms of studio time used, PLEASE PLEASE ME took 585 minutes; SGT. PEPPER took 700 hours!]  In the end, it became a Beatles' masterpiece which continues to stand the test of time.  ESSENTIALbecame a Beatles' masterpiece which continues to stand the test of time.

B00005JKG5|4.0|Alex is a welder by day and an exotic dancer by night, her true passion is dancing and she dreams of being accepted into a professional dance school, except that she lacks the confidence to go after her dream. This type of story, Cinderella goes after her dreams and makes it, is cliched and I love it. Instead of seeing glossy characters with ravishing careers, how about those of us who actually live in the real world and are very much like Alex, we want to see characters like her who are struggling and actually make it! Its a very encouraging and inspiring film for those of us pursuing our dreams. I really like it, I could have done without the naked bar scene later on in the movie. Jennifer Lopez recently did a video based on flashdance and I got to say she was really good. There was a rumor a while back that there might be a flashdance remake with her, and I think that she should do it. J.Lo is perfect for the part! It'd be awesome if she did it.
B0000203Y5|5.0|A previous writer's comment, &quot;The movie needs a story, a thread going all the way through,&quot; illustrates a major difference between North American and Hispanic thinking. While those of northern European descent tend to think and talk in a more or less linear fashion, as if following just one thread, Hispanics tend to think and talk as if weaving a tapestry of many threads.  This film captures perfectly the tapestry effect in that you are not aware that a story is being told until the final scene at Carnegie Hall, when the impact, and the import, of the entire picture becomes crystal clear.  You have to be comfortable with not knowing exactly where you are to handle this kind of exposition.  If this is not a story of excellence forgotten and rediscovered, I don't know what it is.  These people give me hope; their lives tell so many important stories!  If I can create half the beauty in my old age as they do and have done with their music, I'll consider myself successful and fulfilled, indeed.
B00007KQKM|5.0|Very entertaining look at Lady Chatterley.  After reading the book I was very curious to see how the story could be brought to life!  Ken Russell has done a fine job and the two lead actors bring life to Lady C and Mellors.  Prior to this movie, I did not think Sean Bean (Mellors) was anything special, but after seeing his portrayl in this movie- all that has changed.  He is superb and an excellent leading man- just perfect- I do not see how any woman could not fall for him in this role.  Easy to see how Lady C does!  Buy this DVD- you will not be disappointed!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Ever since MP3's hit the scene I've rarely even CONSIDERED buying *ANY* CD.  The music (especially hip-hop) have just been garbage.  It's usually a single with an album based around it.  Few exceptions are Chronic 2001 and a few others I can't think of right now.  After hearing this album on MP3 and went out and purchased it.  I just play it over and over in my car.  It's deep, tight, FULL OF SOUL, just awesome.  I'm totally impressed that I actually signed on to Amazon.com just to see what others thought.  Everybody has different favorites on this album but pretty much EVERYONE loves the album!!  So here's my 2 cents about each track.<br />1.  Intro - Whoever thought this was Cedric is stupid.  It totally sounds like Bernie Mac (but it's Kanye's friend)<br />2.  We don't care - Intro verse is funny as hell!  Dope ass beat and I love the kids jumping in there.<br />3.  Grad Day - Almost spit coke on my dash board!<br />4.  All Falls Down - Bound to have major air play, a video, nuff said.<br />5.  I'll Fly Away - This skit is not pointless ya lame tards.  Take your dumb ass to Church and get a little of that Holy Spirit in your life.  Then it'll make A LOT more sense.<br />6.  Spaceship - Arguably the BEST damn track.  SOUL just drips from this.  Too deep for words.  The wicked beat and lyrics just speaks to me.<br />7.  Jesus Walks - I'm still aquiring this becuase I gotz love for Jesus so I'll have to keep giving this a shot.  Not an instant like for me.<br />8 through 11 - I'm still getting used to these.  Not instant favz for me.<br />12 - AWESOME<br />13 - :D  what can I say?  For me this was an instant hit.  Hopefully people will give it more of a chance.  Just like I'm giving 8 &amp; 9 a chance.<br />15 - I like it (Chipmunks get a little old)<br />18 - Giving it a chance.  Don't like the beat but the lyrics are deep.<br />19 - This song is what got me saying &quot;Who's Kanye West?&quot;  Cuz this song is awesome.  Full of emotion.  CHAKA KHAN's version also OWNZ!  Put this one on REPEAT.<br />20 - This and Spaceship speak to me on a very personal level.  Again lot's of SOUL.  This and spaceship are worth the price of admission.  Best $12.99 spent in years.<br />21 - 12:40 ugg.  Haven't gotten through this thing.  I usually flip back to track 20.  :P<br />BUY THIS ALBUM.<br />-TheMocoMan-<br />tangel@fullerton.eduOWNZ!  Put this one on REPEAT.<br />20 - This and Spaceship speak to me on a very personal level.  Again lot's of SOUL.  This and spaceship are worth the price of admission.  Best $12.99 spent in years.<br />21 - 12:40 ugg.  Haven't gotten through this thing.  I usually flip back to track 20.  :P<br />BUY THIS ALBUM.<br />-TheMocoMan-<BR>tangel@fullerton.edu
B00002E23E|3.0|I would like to elaborate on two quotes by another reviewer.*, **<br />1)<BR>&quot;..The sound is excellent on this DVD, but as another reviewer noted: the 'fake' widescreen matte leaves much to be desired. How about a *remastered*, Special Edition DVD version in *anamorphic widescreen* with *all* of the outtake live performance footage (e.g. 'Celebration Day') as extras?&quot;<br />* I agree: This description is exactly the kind of DVD I would buy and give 5 stars for.  In view of film preservation, this version is inaccurate and imcomplete. I too would prefer the very best special edition possible. As much as I want to watch and relive this film experience again, I can't under the present circumstances-paying money now for the current version would mean I am in agreement with the cheapened mindset of the agency responsible.<BR> Fans should unite and press the issue upon Led Zep management to get to work on releasing the film as described above.  Maybe Jimmy Page is the one who would be able to get the ball rolling...<br />2)<BR> &quot;n.b.--Jimmy Page never played a Les Paul Custom [DVD front cover illustration] onstage with Zeppelin.&quot;<br />**...Absolutely. Futhermore, this cover has nothing to do with the movie-where's the MOVIE POSTER???  The proposed Special Edition DVD should include the ORIGINAL MOVIE POSTER artwork. I cannot believe someone would make such an oversight. - what is up with that guitar on the cover of the current DVD??? - Its a gross display of inaccuracy and negligence that should be corrected at once.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|I have watched 100's of movies in the theaters. This is the first and only movie I have ever walked out on. I put up with 1 hour and 15 minutes and I couldn't take anymore. I have never, EVER seen a movie so dragged out. Every scene in the movie could have been accomplished in about 30 seconds and instead they chose to make it 5 minutes. It was amazing. One scene shows Bill Murray walking around a golf tee and then hitting the ball. It literally took 2 minutes for this segment that meant absolutely nothing. I have never seen such a poorly made movie. You would have to see the movie to know what i am talking about. Unfortunately, I wouldn't let my worst enemy watch this because I think it would be cruel and unusual punishment. Save your time and money on this film.
B00005JKGK|2.0|I thought this movie was incredibly cheesy. So cheesy that when you put it between two slices of bread you could make a cheese sandwich. For instance, the mothers' stories, some of them seem too tragic to be true, I mean it just happens that in the club all 4 of the mothers(older women)coincidently all had tragedies in their earlier lives. Wasn't there one woman who had anything good to say? I think that this movie tried too hard to make people cry by making the stories so tragic and heartbreaking. Talk about sissy stuff. Some of the lines said by the mothers were incredibly cheesy, I can't recall them, but I know that they are a little bit overly done. In general I just don't like it. Every time I watch it, it gets cheesier and cheesier, I think I'll make myself a cheese sandwich now. All this talk about The Joyless Club is making me hungry.
B00005JMKI|5.0|Kidman's performance in Dogville is deserving of an Oscar, much more so than for The Hours. Dogville is essentially a stage play caught on film (and very well done at that!). Everything about this film is done right, the set designs (original!), lighting, sound,  scripting of movements, narrative.. there are no sfx and CG to cover for or distract from the plot and acting - the actors had to put in the work and actually act and the plot had to be compelling. Dogville managed both superbly, in this study of both the good and bad of human nature.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|There is hardly enough that can be said about this film. I have heard that people either love or hate this film after the first time they see it. I was definitley one of those that was impressed. After watching it I only wanted to share it with others for the selfish reason to get their opinion. That is what is nice about this film. It brings up so many issues and ideas that everyone develops their own beliefs and interpretations. I have had many discussions about religion, time travel, love and life because of this film.<br />Donnie- a typical teenager suffering from a mental illness is the focus of this sci fi thriller. I don't want to give anything away so that's basically all you can say. But just be open minded and enjoy the ride, after the film is over you're not even sure if you know what you were watching, or if it even happened.<br />An even further way to experience the film is to go to their interactive website, [...] but I wouldn't recommend doing that until after you see the film. This will definitely be a classic. I just wish I could have seen it in the theaters.
B000002BHE|5.0|This is by far my favorite album of Celine Dion. It really showcases her awesome talent and each song is wonderful! This album is the one that sent her to SuperStar status and showed us all that she can deliver the goods. I never tire of this cd and had to buy it a second time because I wore the first out! I love each song but a couple of my favorites are; &quot;Seduces Me&quot; (so passionate!) and her rendition of Tina Turner's &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; (So uplifting!). Celine and Mariah Carey were neck and neck with ruling the 90's female pop scene. Mariah sent herself in the wrong direction but Celine still reigns! She will be around for a long time!
6305041156|3.0|I am not particularly a fan of Japanese films, I think it is second rate to Chinese movies. Ran however is the exception. I like this movie, I think the movie was very meaningful. I like how the movie started off with the father(King Hidetora)getting pissed off at his son Saburo for talking back bluntly to him with little regard for the father's feelings.  Then later on Hidetora ironically finds out that Saburo was the best and most loyal of his 3 sons. The father later realizes his great mistake for banishing Saburo. So the whole theme of this movie was about loyalty and who you can and shouldn't trust.  This movie was very meaningful to me because it depicts the true human nature of a person and how one thing such as greed or wealth can quickly bring out that person's true nature.  This movie was very sad and disheartening because Hidetora later realized that even the people you loved and trusted most above all others will some day stab you in the back.  What a life to live without love from anyone. I feel greatly for Hidetora and I hope that that kind of thing doesn't happen to me. A very moving story that will pull at your heart strings and make you think twice about who you can really trust in this world.  I kind of had some dislike for this movie because at some parts, it just dragged on and on. The worst thing about this movie was that during the many battle scenes, when the soldiers got killed, the blood was an awfully fake color. It wasn't a deep red color like real blood, it was of a bright orangey-red color, like someone spilled paint all over them.  This unrealistic blood color ruined the whole effect of the movie and just made me realize that I was watching a movie after all.  All the realism quickly went away. I would recommend that you watch it because it is a great story, but I don't know if it's such a great movie to keep because it drags on at certain parts and also there was not much of an indepth storyline, it was just about loyalty, that's aboutit, not much else is involved to beef up the script.
B00005NWM3|4.0|Yeah, yeah, those of you who know me(if not check my profile) you know I am a big tme Heavy Metal fan, but i really loe this album, infact, some of the music could actually be described as Heavy Metal, the rest is mostly hard rock. I really reccomend this to anyone, this is definitely NickelBack's best cd, the hardest i've ever heard by them. Please, don't overlook this album just because it's rock man, any [Hard] Rock or Heavy Metal fan is gobba love this album.
B00023BKMM|3.0|This is what you might call a psychological thriller; based on a Stephen King novella, it is typical Stephen King craziness. Johnny Depp is portraying yet another of his kinky characters. He did some extra good acting in the manifestation scene. Had this movie been considered for the Academy instead of the pirate thing, he just might have won.  Most of the time he went around looking like a frazzled, depressed housewife with that unkempt hair; it appears he had not had a haircut in six months and never combed or brushed it. The glasses did not make him look studious, just unattractive. <br /> <br />As a frustrated writer, he has isolated himself in a cabin by a lake in upstate New York. The Fall leaves were gorgeous. This lovely locale could have been right out of Tim O'Brian's IN THE LAKE OF THE WOODS. The agitated squirrel in the woods was effective. The dog, on the other hand, was another matter altogether. Poor thing.  The quarry where some of the activity took place looked like one here beside Fort Dickerson filled with putrid water. The writer is allegedly stalked by a nasty Southern man from Mississippi -- sure does talk funny. Ted, however supposedly from Tennessee, did not have a Southern accent, did not sound anything like any of our three sections of the state. East, Middle, West TN. all have different accents. He had none of them. <br /> <br />Were these tormentors actual or merely figments of his own imagination? Like in THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT, it was hard to tell what was real and not. He was pushed completely around the bend; could it have been caused by the Jack Daniels Tennessee whiskey (which explains a lot)?  This was as macabre as Edgar Allan Poe's \\"The Tell-tale Heart\\" and as scary as CHILDREN OF THE CORN minus the children, but with the corn. He seemed as crazy as his harasser, talking to himself and even answering. Apparently he was facing his own demons.  <br /> <br />He acted out the 'new' ending to a story he was obsessed with possibly copying it word for word from another author. His belief that the ending is the most important part of a story, as in ALEX AND EMMA; he even talked different and looked like a normal person after the conclusion was accomplished. Though the inhabitants of the town considered him a weirdo.  You are subjected to gross murder, dead dog, burnt down house in Riverdale and an unfaithful wife. But are they real or again figments of his overactive imagination? You decide.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Based on a true story, this film illustrates the horror of war and the holocaust.  Yet it does so in a beautiful way--the cinematography, the direction, and the casting is perfection.  I don't really know what else to say about this film, except that it is a must see.
B000002H33|1.0|Heavily over Rated!!! If there is one Band that is over rated Metallica is it... The sounds never changes... While James is fantastic, his sound remains the same... He needs a fresh break! Where is the rest of the bands in put?  Maybe they are still counting their money, from being selling out... to the commercial masses.
B0000844I8|3.0|I think one of the reasons a highly successful television show spawned from this film is because the producers felt they had to redeem themselves. Although the movie manages to fit ancient Egyptian deities, a pyramid-shaped spaceship, aliens,a nuclear bomb, military ops, a marriage, and messages about everything from slavery to gun control into its two hours, there are still enough plot holes to fit the Giza pyramids in. <br />In fact, the film seems like it would have made a much better movie for TV to begin with. Throughout the entire film, I felt like I had already watched every scene in some other Sci-fi flick. Maybe it was a prototype ten years ago, but now the ideas seem just too stereotypical. The film starts out with an ancient Egyptian dig in the 1920's- Indiana Jones, anyone? - where an ancient stone portal is unearthed, then flashes forward to an unappreciated scientist in the present day, who is recruited to work on the mysterious project of figuring out what the heck the so-called Stargate is supposed to do. Once he does (which takes him all of seven minutes, and you're supposed to assume that the scientists before him couldn't figure out what a triangle symbolized in ancient Egypt)he goes with a scout team led by Kurt Russel into a strange desert planet where dread-locked, shabbily dressed people mine minerals. <br />From there, what could have been a promising movie disintegrates into one goofy scene after another: the native's discovery of the miraculous workings of guns and cigarette lighters (just what I would want to give another civilization), a group of liberty-minded teenagers form a motley crew of militants dressed in the scout team's army vests and helmets,James Spader suddenly learns how to speak ancient Egyptian, subtitles appear, than inconveniently disappear, then appear again, and Kurt Russel gets to kick the stuffing out of Anubis and Horus. <br />There are, however, advantages to this film. There are some winning scenes, most of them with Viveca Lindfors, who plays the aged leader of the Stargate investigation team. She's absolutely charming. James Spader is presentable as the geeky but heroic Daniel Jackson, but he doesn't really have to do anything in the last forty minutes or so because he's always running around. He's much better playing skeevy guys (for instance, his neat role in Sex, Lies and Videotape). Kurt Russel and Jaye Davidson, as Colonel O'Neil and Ra respectively, are the best parts of the whole movie, probably because they just look so fabulous. Jaye Davidson is so androgynously beautiful you wish there were more scenes with him. Kurt Russel plays the melancholy but efficient O'Neil with far less humor than Richard Anderson does on TV, but golly, does he look handsome. Plus, keep an ear open for David Arnold's score. Like everything else in this movie, it borrows heavily from its genre predecessors (in this case, Star Wars), but it's still very, very good. <br />As for the DVD, the special features didn't mean much to me, since I didn't like the film too much anyway, but the color was striking (much yellow and blue, which seems to have been picked solely to accent Mr. Russel's blond hair and blue eyes, and I'm not just saying that) and the sound was also great. If you're in the mood to get a movie that you don't have to think much about, or if you're looking for a creative explanation of the origin of mankind, then this might be of some interest to you.
B000001IQH|5.0|19 tracks that are simply bouncy and fun... a fine mix of punk and pop elements. Hit single &quot;Ruby Soho&quot; is a breakup song with insanely addictive guitars, and as for &quot;Roots Radicals&quot; and &quot;Time Bomb&quot;... they're almost like new Clash material.<br />But going beyond radio songs... the whole record is brilliant. &quot;Maxwell Murder&quot; is the aggressive, splintering opener, and then there're songs like &quot;She's Automatic&quot;... perfect for Saturday and Sunday morning awakenings. Another highlight is &quot;Olympia Wa.&quot;... a mellow track about homesickness.<br />Bouncy, fun, and addictive. It's a great party... without the hangover the next morning.
B000002NG7|4.0|What makes this album so cool is the mood of it, from the cover of the album to the feel of the songs to even the way the band dressed for the tour.  Its real somber, and its like you could tell that THIS was IT,  if you look at &quot;Introduce yourself&quot; and &quot;The Real thing&quot; it was upbeat and full of life, like the begining of something and &quot;Album of the Year&quot; is like the exact opposite.  but its a great album, I knew I would like it as soon as I heard &quot;Collision&quot;, and &quot;Stripsearch&quot; is one of my Favorite FNM songs of all time, among the other great tracks are &quot;Last cup of Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Helpless&quot; which is probably my favorite on the CD, the Whistling solo is great.  &quot;Mouth to Mouth&quot;, &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot;, &quot;She loves me not&quot;, &quot;Paths of Glory&quot;  and &quot;Pristina&quot;, I think that song is such a good song to end the legacy of FNM, it took a while to grow on me at first, but its a great album ender,   <BR>The others like &quot;Naked in front of the Computer&quot; is a very cool song, just not one of the strong ones, as well as &quot;Got that feeling&quot;, both songs hold their own and do not take away from the album at all.   But &quot;Home sick Home&quot; is probably my least favorite FNM song, I've tried to like it, but I just can't, that is the only bad song though.<BR>Jon Hudson is a great guitar player, and songwriter.  <BR>Like I said, this is a Great album,  but you have to understand it,  theres a whole mood here that a lot of people don't get. <br />Its all right there too.  This is the END, and thats the feeling.  I like it,  if you like FNM, then you will probably like it too.  Faith no more were definetly one of the most Underrated, Underappreciated, Overlooked bands.
B0000931OG|5.0|This is by far the most controversial Blur album yet made. Half of the fans think it's the best, pure genuis. The other half thinks Blur needs to go to hell.<BR>I'm not going to tell you what you'll think of this album, just what I think. I think this is one of their best(Next to 13), but you may think it sucks.<br />This CD is full of beauty. \\"Out of Time\\" is my favorite Blur song. Period. It is an awesome song that is just too true.<BR>Although some didn't like \\"Jets\\", I think it is one of the better. So what if it has a freaking sax solo? Why does that even matter? Just because its lyrics don't make any sense is no reason to hate it.<BR>I half agree with the criticisms on \\"Crazy Beat\\", people saying that it's an old ripoff of \\"Song 2\\" and \\"B.L.U.R.E.M.I\\", and I admit that is what it sounds like. But come on people, ALL bands do that at least once or twice. I mean look at Linkin Park. They just play the same song over and over with different lyrics. I think people are blowing it totally out of proportion. So they copied their own song. That's what bands do when they get hit songs. And really, everyone makes mistakes. Just because they're rock stars doesn't mean they're gods.<br />1. Ambulance: 5/5<BR>Really good song. Good starting song, a ramp up point for the rest of the album<BR>2. Out of Time: 5/5<BR>Best song on the album. Beautiful and poetic and perfect in every way. If anything, get the album for this song, even if you hate the rest.<BR>3. Crazy Beat: 3.5/5<br />Well it's unoriginal, but it's still better than what most bands can come up with.<BR>4. Good Song: 4.5/5<BR>It's a good song, just not really my favorite on the album. I don't really know why, it just isn't.<BR>5. On the Way to the Club: 5/5<BR>Really good song. Like most of the album, I can't really put my finger on why I like it. I just do.<BR>6. Brothers and Sisters: 5/5<BR>It really pisses me off that the CD got a parental advisory just because this song is about drugs and they say horny twice. OH GOD!! CALL THE PRIEST! WE NEED TO EXORCISE THIS CD IMMEDIETELY! OUT SATAN, OUT!!!! People make me sick sometimes.<BR>7. Caravan: 5/5<BR>The world music tonmes are really good in this song. It's just pretty and good.<BR>8. We've Got a File On You: 4.5/5<BR>It's good, I just wish it had some other lyrics. Hypocritical since I really like \\"Jets\\", but whatever.<BR>9. Morrocan Peoples Revolutionary Bowls Club: 4/5<BR>It's a good song, and very practical, it's just not my favorite. Who knows why.<BR>10. Sweet Song: 5/5<BR>This song is verry pretty and.. I don't know, i just like it.<BR>11. Jets: 5/5<BR>I've said it enough before, but I really like this song, if for no other reason than that other people dislike it for really stupid reasons.<BR>12. Gene by Gene: 4.5/5<BR>Another song that I don't like as much kind of randomly. The brain is a funny thing.<BR>13. Battery in Your Leg: 5/5<BR>Beautiful piano and it's a great closure to a great CD.<br />Well, thatis what I think about Think Tank. Listen for yourself, and if you don't like it, sue me.
B000002JR8|3.0|I own four Pantera albums so far, and Far Beyond Driven is by  far the worst album I've heard from Pantera.  Now that's a pretty harsh thing to say, so let me clarify by saying that I do like this album, but the other three albums I've got by Pantera, I think are much better than Far Beyond Driven.  There a few songs on this album that I don't like at all.  There is \\"Becoming,\\" I realize that people think this song is one of Pantera's best, but I just don't like the song that much.  Then there is \\"Good Friends And A Bottle Of Pills\\", this song should not have even been on the album.  It is not really that heavy, it just has awful guitar sounds along with drums, bass, and lyrics that are explicitly disgusting words of lust and sexual behavior with another guy's girl; this song gets a -10 out of 10.  \\"Throes Of Rejection\\" is better musically as a heavy metal song, but again, the lyrics are too lousy.<BR>On the other hand, \\"5 Minutes Alone\\", \\"I\\"m Broken\\", \\"Slaughtered\\", and \\"Shedding Skin\\" are the best songs on the album.  Oh yeah, Pantera's rendition of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\" is really awesome, it is a very relaxing, slow ballad.  I'm surprised that \\"Planet Caravan\\" is on the best of Pantera album.
B000002UW1|5.0|There're lots of good albums out there, but there's a big gap between good and great... something almost unexplainable. It's like going from one world to another. That's what great music is all about... altering consciousness. Document is truly something that absorbs the listener, plain and simple.<br />Document's hit singles, &quot;It's the End of the World As We Know It (and I feel fine)&quot; and &quot;The One I Love&quot;, are more than just radio staples... they're pleasant reminders of the excellent poets of the last few centuries. The same can be said for &quot;Finest Worksong&quot;, &quot;Fireplace&quot;, and so many others. It's lyrical music, with a new wave touch.<br />The political songs, &quot;Welcome to the Occupation&quot;, &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot;, and &quot;Disturbance at the Heron House&quot;, are the greatest trio of government-related tracks on any rock record ever. A southern touch, a clip of former senator Joe McCarthy (one that's quite revealing, actually), and soothing figurativism... it's subtle, charming, and ultimately powerful.<br />Document is proof that R.E.M. was ready to go from indie to mainstream and continue maintaining artistic capability and credibility. It will not, and can not, be forgotten.
B000060P79|5.0|People, get it to your heads: It depends on the type of music you like. Simple Plan in my opinion is better than GC, or Blink-182, or Linkin Park, but that's my opinion. You call yourselves reviewers, only pointing out the bad things. Why do you by the CD when you hate the group in the first place? This CD is the best, and it tells about what a teenager is going through. Besides, you don't know how the singer really feels inside his heart unless you ask him personally. People who only point out bad things, that's pretty sad. You sound like pesky, stubborn little kids. If you want to only point out bad things, make an anti-Simple Plan website and leave the rest of the world out of your negative hatred twards music groups. If you think you can do better, then why don't you form a band, see if anyone listens to you. See if you make millions of dollars and have billions of fans. <br />Anyway, Simple Plan is the best and that's it. This CD rules, it's not too slow, it's not too fast, it's not way too heavy, and not too light. It's &quot;Perfect.&quot;
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I just watched this movie for prob. the 5th time. I watched it with a group of my friends about 10 of them at the end of the movie they all went what??? This movie is great if your not a shallow person, it has an amazing them running throughout the movie. For those of you that need a little help....pay attention to what donnie tells his science teacher about gods hand in human choice and destiny. This movie makes you think it has left a huge impact on me I'm a big music guy havent really branched out into movies yet, I really hope that there are more of like   this.
B000002UA9|5.0|This is the first album by the greatest band of the rock n roll era. This is a excellent record and a must have. It opens with the rocker &quot;I saw her standing there&quot;, written by the band in Hamburg in the 50s. This album was recorded in one long 24 hours session at the EMI studios in London, 1963. &quot;Misery&quot; is a very short song, but a great listen. &quot;Anna (go to him)&quot;, &quot;Chains&quot;, &quot;Boys&quot;, &quot;Baby it's you&quot;, &quot;A taste of honey&quot; and &quot;Twist N Shout&quot; are all covers the band used to do in their stage act and all sound superb here on disc. <BR>&quot;Love me do&quot; was the groups 1st pop hit, making #17 in the UK top 50. &quot;Please Please me&quot; quickly followed and was #1. <BR>After this album, The Beatles were still unknown in the USA, that, however, was about to change after the next album! Beatlemania had now swept the UK nation and was about to go global!

0689859368|5.0|This is one of my son's favorite books (he's 7).  The adventures of the Grace kids are exciting, but not too scary or violent.  The main characters are well-developed and totally believable.  Part of the beauty of this book is it's brevity--at about 100 pages it's much more reasonable for the 6-8 age group than the Harry Potter series.  The illustrations are also wonderful.  I prefer this series over the Unfortunate Events books because it has a more upbeat theme and positive interactions between the main characters, which I think is better for younger readers.
B000059Z8M|5.0|I've just watched this film on TV with my family, and, since we all loved it, turned to this page to see about buying it. But - no surprise - the geniuses at Disney have locked this one up in their vault (along with the original &quot;Toy Story&quot;), and aren't making it available for sale. So instead of Disney making money by selling me one, I'm going to have to scout around and buy a second-hand copy, or simply videotape it when it's repeated on the Disney Channel. Either way, we won't have the 'mint' copy we'd like, and Disney will be losing another sale. Talk about bad business decisions!
B000002UAC|5.0|Realeased just before they took off in the USA. Another classic album, with many sweet soft pop and hard rock tunes.
B000000W6X|5.0|I'm really surprised to see Mezzanine got a better average rating than this one as Protection undoubtedly is one of the most important electronic releases of the 90's. True it's not as conceptual as \\"Blue lines\\" but it's certainly not a uneven album either as i've read it many times... All the tracks, without exception, are good ( actually most are excellent ) and in my view it wouldn't be exagerated to say that Protection stands as a best-of triphop all by itself. And no, \\"Heat miser\\" is not the best track here, and yes i do like the cover of \\"light my fire\\" which sounds cool an ends this resolutely dark album on a brighter note.<BR>If you're seeking a soundtrack for your cold urban winters Protection is just unmissable.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is an excellent portrayal of the horrors of WWII, seen from the perspective of one victim.  The tragedy and triumph of one man is masterfully acted by Brody, who deservedly won the oscar for his performance.  Fantastic, gripping, heartwrenching movie that is entirely worthwhile in our time of frequently mindless entertainment.  Highly recommended for adults and mature teens.  Keep your younger kids unexposed to this, as they may not be able to process the intense and complex emotions aroused by the picture.
B00006879E|4.0|Well balanced CD between harder rockin' material &amp; light rock/R&amp;B. CD opens with one of the top tracks of 2003: Harder To Breathe, This Love is an appealing, lighter tune which shows the musical variety of this bands music. Other recommended tracks include: She Will Be Loved, Tangled, The Sun &amp; Sunday Morning. Overall, there's no weak songs here. Would have given 5 stars if one or two more songs had a harder rockin' edge to them. If you like Harder To Breathe &amp; This Love get this CD...you won't be disappointed! <BR>     The future is bright for Maroon 5. I will buy their next CD even if I'm not familiar with any of the songs on it.
B0000029GA|5.0|This is arguably the greatest album in the history of rap its not catchy and watered down like music is today. It was the best album to come in a time when rap was about dropping great albums and not weak songs that make u dance. In my opinion there is not a wack song on here u can bump it from track one till the end. Some might say that the album is to short and thats the only flaw i see from this album. If u listen alot of these new rappers are nas clones they follow after illmatic but i dont think anybody can match this album big came close with ready to die but no cigar. its the ultimate perfict album as far as beats rhymes and content. 5 star classic hands down

0783227434|4.0|Army of Darkness has a great story, great acting, and great fighting. The only reason that it didn't get five stars is that it doesn't have enough gore. The gore in this movie doesn't even compare to Evil Dead. The action is awsome and so is the comedy. Ash is spitting out one-liners while he is killing the crap out of the dead army. Great Movie, I definetly recommend it!!!
B0001ENY6M|5.0|An incredible movie with an incredible score! Both movies &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; and &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; have one instrument that is not exposed to the world yet. Of course, scholars and most Armenians know what that instrument is; it is called &quot;Duduk&quot;. You might have also heard this instrument in movies like &quot;The Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Ronin&quot; where there is no where stated the fact that this is an ancient Armenian instrument in any of these movies. This instrument is probably the very soul of the Armenian people. Just like Christianity (which Armenians are the first republic to accept Christianity as an official religion in the year 301) has been passed down from generation to generation. So to call this instrument a Turkish or a Russian instrument is a terrible swing at this nation's face. This instrument has been around as long as Armenians have, which is for more than 2000 years. As an Armenian, I feel terrible when a person like Peter Gabriel takes credit for taking Armenian folk pieces with the use of &quot;Duduk&quot; and then is considered a genius for music that he stole. It is ridiculous, intolerable and very humiliating that crooks like him simply steal music from a historical nation like this.
B00005JN02|5.0|`Good Bye, Lenin!' is a fascinating German film that was for unclear reasons denied a best foreign film nomination in the recent Oscars, but I consider it one of the best films I've seen this year. `Good Bye, Lenin!' is an entertaining and surreal black comedy, that doesn't really stand the test of logic and reality, but beneath the surface it's really a very socially conscious film, that gets across very well the atmosphere and problems of the post-communist East Germany.<br />The story is of Alex, whose mother, a devoted member of the Communist Party, suffers a heart attack which sends her into a coma - through which she sleeps throughout the months of revolution and the fall of the communist regime. When she awakes, the doctors warn Alex not to cause his mother any anxiety or excitement; therefore, he goes to ludicrously immense lengths to keep her convinced that communism in East Berlin is still alive. Not much of it, once again, stands the test of reason, but it's incredibly witty and entertaining, and manages, throughout, to get across some powerful statements.<br />`Good Bye, Lenin!' is both fun and important, a film which I recommend to everyone. Don't be afraid of European cinema; even though the film might be difficult to come by, it's very rewarding and well worth your time.
B000002J09|5.0|OK first off LED ZEPPELIN IS BY FAR THE GREATEST ROCK BAND EVEEEEEEEEERR.

B000002BQK|5.0|This is my number one fave Mariah album - it was also the 1st Mariah disc I ever bought. I can listen to it straight through without skipping a track & consider it to be one of the best albums in my collection.<br /><br />I understand that a lot of her fans abandoned Mariah upon release of this disc because they felt it strayed from her former albums' formula & that's a shame because this is one of the best produced overall albums in her catalog. Each song just flows into the next making it extremely enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />My track by track review:<br /><br />HONEY - great sample used, fun lyrics - great hook 10/10<br /><br />BUTTERFLY - heartfelt ballad, operatic buildup - great song 10/10<br /><br />MY ALL - lovely ballad, love the spanish guitar sound - 10/10<br /><br />THE ROOF - dreamy ballad that could take anyone back to their teenage years, a first love, stealing time away with that person<br />9/10<br /><br />FOURTH OF JULY - beatiful ballad, my fave on the album. Too bad it wasn't released as a single  10/10<br /><br />BREAKDOWN - great song, collabo with two fellas from Bone-Thugz & Harmony  10/10<br /><br />BABYDOLL - midtempo song, not one of my faves but Mariah's vocals make up for the 'meh' factor 8/10<br /><br />CLOSE MY EYES - another beautiful ballad  10/10<br /><br />WHENEVER YOU CALL - gorgeous ballad, it's just Mariah's voice & piano accompanying 10/10<br /><br />FLY AWAY (BUTTERFLY REPRISE) - love this track  10/10<br /><br />THE BEAUTIFUL ONES - not as grab you by the throat as the inimitable Prince but this is a good remake with Sisquo  9/10<br /><br />OUTSIDE - 8/10<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this disc to fans and non-fans alike, there are enough beautiful ballads to keep her die-hard fans satisfied mixed with a few hip-hop tracks to interest fans of that genre of music.
B000089CKH|5.0|Nada Surf was dropped from their label after writing the Proximity Effect, with their label claiming that there was no &quot;hit&quot; track on the album.  Although there was no &quot;Popular&quot; this album, it was a gigantic step foward that few bands take after being exposed by the MTV phenomenon.  &quot;Let Go&quot; is yet another leap foward for a band that has the musical potential to be one of the greats.  From the moving, acoustic opening track of &quot;The Blizzard of '77&quot;, to the drifting nuances of &quot;Paper Boats&quot; to conclude the album, Nada Surf do something rarely seen today: write a beautiful free flowing ALBUM (not just tracks tacked carelessly together).  Standouts are the stunning ballad &quot;Inside of Love&quot;, the rollicking &quot;High Speed Soul&quot;, the mind blowing &quot;Killian's Red&quot;  and the hook laden &quot;Treading Water&quot;.  In today's musical day and age, it makes unfortunate sense that this band is still reletively unknown (although they apparently have a fairly large following in Europe).  But give them just a bit more time and they will undeniably break out.  They are fantastically talented.  If you like good songwriting in your rock music, buy this album!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I saw Gavin for the first time on VH1 inside track about a year ago, and I decided to check him out. It was one of the best things i ever did. His cd was the first one where i could listen to it from start to finish and not skip anything! The music is soulful and catchy (boy is it catchy!!!) and i listen to it any chance i get, which is pretty much every day. When i heard that he was opening up for the barenaked ladies, i was thrilled. I went, and found out that he was an amazing live performer as well. i am definitely interested in seeing him in a show all his own. I would love to see him win a grammy for best new artist, and i think he will be huge.
B00005OM4N|5.0|This CD of Ms. Britney Spears titled Britney, is one awesome CD! I think Britney is so cool and this CD is so cool. All of the songs are amazing, and Britney sings them from the heart! Some of my faves are, I'm a slave 4 u, I'm not a girl, I love rock n' roll, and that's where you take me. I admit I used to be a Britney hater for 2 years in the 7th and 8th grade, but now I love her alot! Not in a gay way but in a fan way. I suggest that you buy this CD today! It totally rocks!
B000002GQG|5.0|Ok, so I'm not good at writing review titles. Some call this the Moody Blues' only psychadelic album but they've had others in the core 7. Anyway if we just stopped thinking about labels and listening to the music it's more enjoyable. I first got really in the first six songs which I think are the first side for the LP. I still don't like &quot;Voices In the Sky&quot;, a little too melancholic. &quot;Departure&quot; is a great intro to &quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot;. I'd heard the single version of &quot;Ride My See-Saw&quot; before, but hearing the segue was just awesome. &quot;The Actor&quot; is another song to look out for written by Justin Hayward. If you program it you can listen to it without hearing the beginning or end of another song. Another song that stands alone and is now one of my favorite is Ray Thomas' &quot;Legend of a Mind&quot;, words can't describe it, it just rocks! &quot;Dr. Livingstone, I presume&quot; is a fun tune to listen to. &quot;House of Four Doors&quot; is pretty neat but it doesn't really make much sense maybe it takes time to figure it out. &quot;The Best Way to Travel&quot; by Mike Pinder is another highlight very experiment with the mellotron and all those sounds you hear. Next &quot;Visions of Paradise&quot; reminds of a jungle or an old movie. &quot;The Word&quot; is and intro to &quot;Om&quot; pronounced aum. I definitely recommend this album to anyone
B000067CPX|5.0|This is by far, the greatest album in the band's career. John Frusciante (guitarist) is the mastermind behind all of the incredible melodies this album has to offer. Give it a listen sometime and see how some bands actually do get better with age. I truly love this album, it is simply astonishing
6305972591|5.0|First off, forget about all the sequels,children of the corn this and children of the corn that, and take a look at the original. In the tiny village of Gatlin all the children, led by preacher Issac have slaughtered all the town's adults.Creeepy! Now onto our heros,Burt and Vicky who are just passing through,minding their own busines,when they hit a child who happens to be standing in the middle of the road....But for Burt and Vicky it's only the beginning of their nightmare. Yes it's the kids revenge as Issac orders his hit-man Maliki to kill the \\"outlanders\\" as they call them. Luckily Burt finds Jobe and Sarah (actually I lie, coz they found him),the only two children not corrupted by the evil lurking presence of the corn feild. Children of the corn is Stephen King's best. It's got great scare sequences and let me just say that the movie's musical score is a masterpeice in itself.It'd give anyone the chills.So, simply that's why I like this movie. This was Deathgirl, telling you why Children of the corn is a horror classic.Kill the outlanders....
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an amazing book that I'd recommend to ANYONE.  At first it might seem a little bit confusing, but after the first letter or two you'll get right on track.  You don't know who Charlie is writing to...But whoever it is, it helps Charlie in so many ways.  The end of the book was a real shocker to me, maybe there were more clues that explained it, but I only found a few...it was an interesting surprise that made the book fit toegtehr even better than it had been already!  Also I liked seeing Charlie's reacitons to the books that his English teacher reccomended to him.  I'd read To Kill A Mockingbird and Cathcher in the Rye and I lvoed both of them, as did Charlie.  It even made me (somewhat) want to read some of the other classics Charlie was recommended because he liked them all so much!  Please read this book, you won't regret it!  Its Fabulous. :-)
B00000AFHM|5.0|I have not been this happy with an album purchase in a long time.  I first heard the song &quot;Boy With the Arab Strap&quot; about a month ago.  I was at work, and one of the maintenance guys was playing it on a boom box in the basement.  I was struck by its beauty, but I dallied in buying the album.  <br />Now that I have it, I wish I'd bought it sooner.  Literally every song is memorable.  Two are absolutely haunting: &quot;Boy With the Arab Strap&quot; and &quot;Sleep the Clock Around.&quot;  And here's something else -- it gets better with each listen.<br />I can really relate to the reviewer who wrote that he would always remember this album as his &quot;summer&quot; album.  It actually feels like something from my past, like a children's song -- especially &quot;Rollercoaster Ride.&quot; (The first line is straight out of Sesame Street: &quot;Hey people looking out the window at the city below...&quot;) <br />This album is so sweet it makes me want to cry.
0380799006|5.0|This book was EXACTLY what I was looking for.  In dealing with my two stepsons as well as my own two daughters, ranging in age from one to seven, I felt there HAD to be a way to prevent some of this fierce competitive and unkind nature between kids.  I refused to believe there was nothing much we parents could do about it.  The perspective it gave in how to treat the children each as individuals, without reference or comparison to their siblings in any way seemed obvious, yet for most of us parents, we do these things unconsciously in various daily situations.  I began realizing how even the smallest comments, however well-intended, could induce rivalry between the kids and have found the ideas and suggestions in this book to be of immeasurable value to my family.  In some areas, I do feel that it gets a little too extreme to be realistic, however, the main concept behind the advice and suggestions is very helpful.
B00005JN1L|5.0|eThis movie really kept me guessing, and guessing is always fun while you're in a dark movie theater, your eyes becoming more glued to the screen with every frame and your fingers clutching the seat with anxiousness. This movie will certainly do this for you. It's a true blast, and Johnny Depp is amazing as usual. He really has a knack for playing the offbeat character-- perhaps because he himself is offbeat, but in a way that makes you want to see more.<br />Depp stars as Mort, a writer with a severe case of writer's block. He takes long naps, talks to his dog, sits at his computer hoping to write something other than \\"bad writing,\\" which he won't even bother with. If it's bad, he deletes it. There is no editing. So along comes John Shooter (Turturro) who claims that Mort stole a story of his who leaves behind his manuscript for Mort to look over. Mort is dismissive at first, but soon discovers that Shooter could be more of a problem than what he first thought. <br />Did Mort really steal the story? Nah, and don't worrry-- my mentioning this is not really a spoiler. There's a bit of backstory in this movie with Mort's estranged wife and her new boyfriend and how Mort is coping with the fact that his wife is sleeping with someone other than her husband. I like that this movie is full of mystery, but isn't so twisted that you're not sure what's going on... well, until the end that is. <br />This movie had an ending that I wasn't so thrilled with, and perhaps you may agree with me on it after you actually see the movie because I refuse to give away the twist ending. It's typical. That's all I'll say. (You may disagree-- I'm sure lots of people will like the ending, and I'll bet this is a movie that some people may see more than once, just to catch all those things they might have missed throughout it the first time.)<br />I still give this movie five stars. Not only is Depp fantastic, as he always is, but even though I didn't really like the ending, I was NOT expecting it, and I can truly appreciate that. I love it when it's unexpected, and I'm sure audiences will have their mouths covered in amazement when the final revelation happens. <br />This movie is definitely worth the few dollars to see at the movies. But don't get popcorn. You might not want it as the movie progresses. It freaked me out in some spots to the point where my stomach was in knots, but in a good way-- in the way any thrilling movie should do. I did like that it carried a quirky tone as well, it definitely suits Johnny Depp. His mannerisms and some of his lines and predicaments will make anyone laugh. So see it, you're bound to like it.
B00005JMCN|3.0|Seabiscuit has a touch of nostalgia, a happy ending, and the distinctive feel of documentaries and biopics. The movie is beautifully filmed and well acted but unevenly scripted and a bit dull. Visuals are definitely a highlight of the movie. Watching this on a big screen was a feast for the eyes. Scenery is beautifully captured and colors are crisp and vibrant throughout. The story and its message are uplifting and the final scenes are well told, but much of the rest of the movie was a disappointment. The acting is fine (as one might expect from the individuals involved), but the script is cliche-riddled and unsophisticated; as a result the actors' performances never feel special. Overall, I felt like the movie was trying too hard to blend big-story telling with documentary filmmaking style: pretty, a tad slow, alternately moving and unaffecting.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is only the best SF series to hit television since, well,<BR>   since ever.<P>Fortunately it's been resurrected on DVD. Fox cancelled the series even as it was winning an Emmy. Figures. Firefly is a welcome relief from the hoary Star Trek franchise: smart, surprising, and funny.<P>&quot;I know something ain't right.&quot;<BR>&quot;Sweetie, we're crooks. If everything were right, we'd be in jail.&quot;<P>It's a western set in outer space, about 500 years hence. The premise makes sense if you consider that the inhabitants of newly-terraformed worlds should (must!) rely only on the sort of very simple technology that they can make and maintain for themselves (horses &amp; buggies, six-shooters), even though a very advanced technology (spaceships) is required to get them there in the first place. <P>Malcolm Reynolds is not James Kirk.<P>&quot;I'm thinking Whitefall. We'll talk to Patience.&quot;<BR>&quot;Sir, we don't want to deal with Patience again.&quot;<BR>&quot;Why not?&quot;<BR>&quot;She shot you.&quot;<BR>&quot;Well, yeah, she did a bit. Still..&quot;<P>And Serenity is not the Enterprise.<P>&quot;Come on, you haven't seen most of it, let me show you the rest. And try to see past what she is, and on to what she can be.&quot;<BR>&quot;What's that, sir?&quot;<BR>&quot;Freedom, is what.&quot;<BR>&quot;I meant: what's that?&quot;<BR>&quot;Oh. Just step around it.&quot;<P>And then there's the music. I predict that when you've reached the last episode, you'll watch the whole thing through again, just for the music. And maybe a third time. And a fourth. And...
B00005JN1L|4.0|I saw this movie yesterday and I left the theater neither extremely satisfied or dissapointed. To tell you the truth, most people walking out said they wished they had waited to catch it on HBO for free. If it weren't for Johnny Depp's star power and his weirdly interesting performance in this film, I could see this as a made for T.V. movie. Stephen King is a great writer, but this was one of his weaker stories and I wasn't expecting much going in. So in the end I really did enjoy it much more than I thought I would. *Spoilers* The ending is similar to the movie Identity and everyone in the theater saw it coming a mile away, especially if you have seen the other movie I just mentioned. Which was okay, but it left more questions than answers as did the ending of Identity. John Turturro is usually a great actor, but I found him unconvincing and even slightly annoying at times, as he tried to play the sinister stalking madman. If you are the mood for a solid thriller with a few scares and another fine performance from Mr. Depp, check this movie out if you dare.
B000001ESP|5.0|Band class was never my forte and yet for some reason I stuck with it throughout my secondary school years.  My high school band director, Mr. Shapiro, actually once urged me to \\"play quietly\\" at an important band competition in Florida.  Sure that comment hurt my feelings, but it would have taken more than that to get me to drop out of the three bands to which I proudly belonged: concert, marching, and jazz.  Heck, sophomore year Mr. Shapiro actually insisted four of his least talented musicians (including me, of course) spend second period of the entire year in a small room away from the rest of the class, a scarring experience I previously detailed in my review of Iron Maiden's Somewhere In Time cd.  If that banishment didn't humiliate me into quitting the band, believe me, nothing could.  <br />Besides, there was one other alto sax player in the band, Topper, who was almost as bad as me.  A glutton for punishment, Mr. Shapiro often forced Topper and me to engage in saxophone duels over second-to-last (5th) chair, much to the chagrin of our classmates.  The 3rd and 4th chairs of John and Courtney were way beyond our reach, even after Courtney abandoned her saxophone practice habits and Rush fixation to embark on a period of rampant promiscuity that challenged the efficacy of even the most potent birth control pills.  <br />One individual who regularly put contraceptive regimes to the test but never abandoned his Rush fixation, however, was Mike, by far the best sax player and arguably the finest musician in the band.  Mike had a stranglehold on first-chair that his chief rival, Jeff, harbored no illusions of ever usurping.  Jeff was good, but Mike clearly was special.  And it wasn't just on the sax that Mike worked his magic, a fact he made apparent to us every time Mr. Shapiro took a sick day.<br />On the days Mr. Shapiro spent convalescing at home, we were expected to practice during band class as though he was actually present.  In reality, however, as soon asclass began, someone would usually end up putting a Van Halen or Rush album on the band room stereo system.  Eventually, a collective urge to emulate our heroes would strike us.  The stereo would be abruptly turned off and someone would start jamming.  Desperate to shed my musical loser label, I'd venture over to the keyboards where I was far more competent than on saxophone and start cranking out the intro to \\"Jump\\" or \\"I'll Wait\\".  There'd be this brief moment where everyone would begin to rethink their opinion of me until Terry, our fantastic tinted-glasses wearing drummer, would come in on the skins and I'd start screwing up the tempo.  That would be about the time Mike would saunter over, brush me aside, and take over playing those keyboard riffs flawlessly.  <br />As much as everyone enjoyed hearing Mike play Van Halen songs, he'd soon be inundated with requests for the song that we all loved to hear him play, \\"Red Barchetta\\".  Rumor had it that Mike could play the keyboard parts for every song on Rush's already legendary Moving Pictures album, but the crowd primarily wanted to hear \\"Red Barchetta\\" so unfortunately that rumor remains unsubstantiated to this day.  <br />As always, Mike and Terry blazed their way through a torrid version of \\"Red Barchetta\\" and I returned to being regarded as a musical loser.  I can't even imagine what my classmates would have thought of my musical skills had Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson been in our band class.  Competing with Mike was bad enough but can you imagine having to compete with those three as well?  Most people, including Courtney in her pre-puberty incarnation, regard the Moving Pictures album as Geddy, Neil, and Alex's artistic zenith and I've yet to encounter any evidence that contradicts that position.  The playing on Moving Pictures is dizzyingly spectacular and the song-writing is top notch and shockingly traditional relative to Rush's usual more progressive fare.  The album includes my personal favorite Rush song (would you believe, \\"Red Barchetta\\"?) as well as the greatest rock music instrumental I have ever heard (\\"YYZ\\").  Mention the latter to my friend Chris, circa 1986, and he'd have offered you a 5-minute monologue on its myriad merits.  Then, of course, you've got the two radio mega-hits, \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight\\" whose awesome power have been somewhat sanitized due to years of radio saturation.  Side 2 features classic Rush deep cuts like \\"The Camera Eye\\" and \\"Vital Signs\\".  Moving Pictures is the one Rush album that every rock fan MUST have in his or her collection.

B0001AP12G|5.0|it's refreshing to finally listen to a pure hip hop album. 50 cent and lil jon just wasn't doing it for me. i love this album. i'd say it's almost as expirmental as outkast's speakerboxsx/tlb but less haunting. it's songs like &quot;get em high&quot; and &quot;all falls down&quot; that brought me back to mid 90's hip hop sound. &quot;get em high&quot; with talib kweli and common is the hottest track on the album. in the song is a conversation on the phone over the beat which reminded of the firm's &quot;phone tap&quot;. the new workout plan is a good play on words and the beat to it is mind-blowing. <br />for a while i was shying away from hip hop but this album got me right back into it. this is an awesome debut. pick up this album asap.
B0001ADAVK|5.0|I don't know why everyone is so negative in their reviews here. I thought the movie was great! I felt not only was Julia Roberts excellent as always, but Julia Stiles and Kirsten Dunst were also worthy of praise for their roles. Remember the setting is the northeast in 1953-1954. There is a little &quot;Hollywood&quot; over-exageration of themes, but that's Hollywood. I felt the picture painted of ivy league women's colleges of that time period was well portrayed. And I thoroughly enjoyed this film.
1881273156|5.0|My wife and I teach a small class in church geared toward young married couples.  We used this book in our class and it saved the marriage of one of the couples.  They were on the verge of separating and now they are stronger than they've ever been.  We've shared Gary Chapman's Five Love Language principles with other friends and it has worked wonders on their marriages as well.  Our friend is a social worker and he has used this book to improve failing marriages.  It works!<br />The Five Love Languages videotape is also great and is recommended as well - Gary Chapman is very funny and a very good speaker.  This book is a MUST READ for all couples, even for those whose marriages are stable - it will strenghten and enhance solid marriages.  HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!<br />For couples with children I would also recommend Chapman's Five Love Languanges for Children and Five Love Languanges for Teenagers.
B00007KQA3|5.0|The book nineteen eighty-four was destined to be a film. This movie is a perfect example of what films of today are missing. On too many occasions filmmakers pander to their audience by overstating the details of the \\"plot points\\" rendering the viewer mindless. Director Michael Radford (IL Postino) creates a disturbing world that is far too similar to the present. The film is about a government called \\"The Party\\" that uses the media coverage of a war as a way to manipulate the past, present and future of mankind as a form of control. Those who question the \\"reality\\" (the media) are called \\"traitors\\".  For some this film may require a second viewing not because it is not comprehensive, but because the film its self purposely manipulates the viewer. Pure brilliance!
B00006NSGX|4.0|This double cd is very nice.  It opens up with an accoustic set which includes a very nice bell bottom blues and a beautiful tears in heaven and change the world.  Then the electric stuff starts out with a great fathers eyes.  Disc 2 goes into a nice old one w/ badge and a medocure cocaine and a nice wonderful tonight.  Lalya is a standout on this double disc with a terrific piano outro.  and it stays good with the last 2 tracks espcially sunshine of your love.<BR>All and all this is a good double live album worth buying the only reason why i gave it a 4 was because i know there is better stuff out there from clapton.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|Manny is right all the way. If Cannibal Corpse changed their style, they wouldn't be Cannibal Corpse anymore, Nightloaf dumb@ss. I have every single album that Cannibal has ever done, they are all excellent death metal. And just for the record,George &quot;Corpsegrinder&quot; Fisher is far superior to Chris &quot;hippie&quot; Barnes. Look at Barnes now, he's nothing but a fat hippie pothead. Haha. And I just happen to enjoy all the gory bloody lyrics and sadistic artwork. It makes me laugh and feel better. The wretched spawn is an awesome album, definately some of the best work from Cannibal, the DVD kicks @ss too. I'm glad the true fans like Manny agree with me, and dumb@sses like Nightloaf can go listen to their sissy black metal. And I can't believe Nightloaf is just now getting into Slayer, haha what a poser.
B000063WDH|3.0|ok, look people, seriously. you people need to seriously start listening to a little thing i'd like to call &quot;music&quot;.  many people do not know what this is, which, frankly, is just sad.  examples of non music: LINKIN PARK, britney spears, incubus, ect.  and second of all, its not wrong to compare the black keys with the white stripes. the white stripes DO PLAY THE BLUES its just mostly on their second album which too many jackasses are too hung up on seven nation army to even look it up.  all i can say is the black keys ARE REALLY good as musicians, however, the white stripes still kick everyone's ass that is the music industry right now.  so my verdict is: black keys are execeptionally good, but the white stripes are better.
B000060P79|5.0|Im sick and tired of you people. Ok I will say GC are pretty manufactured but shut up already. All you people do is complain about what band is and isn't &quot;punk&quot;. Well you should get a life and stop labeling people. Now for the cd. I love this the songs are simple and meaningful. I will admit &quot;addicted&quot; was overplayed but the other songs are awesome. My favorite song is &quot;ill meet you there&quot;. its really sad and deep. When you are feeling down listion to this you will feel better.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|It's easy to feel out of joint in a modern city. Even easier if the city is not your own. Easier still if you're jet-lagged and on the other side of the world, and if your domestic life &quot;back home&quot; isn't going so well. In most parts of the world you at least have Western looking signs to look at and guess the meaning of. In Japan and China, you don't.<br />&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; captures that feeling of adriftness perfectly. It's as if you're freefalling in space, and suddenly you find a little solid ground to hold on to. In the movie the solid ground for Charlotte is over-the-hill actor Bob (Bill Murray), and the solid ground for him is relatively new bride Charlotte (Scarlett Johannson).<br />Sofia Coppola shows perfectly the feeling of being in a place where nothing quite seems to fit, except that maybe you have found someone who speaks to your heart. And then, there's the poignancy of being the right soul, born in the wrong time. Coppola's script completely deserves the Academy Award for its minimalist elegance. The photography is beautiful and moody. The soundtrack fits the mood perfectly.<br />For those who find the movie slow, consider this. It takes time to show dislocation. A movie in which people are moving fast and purposefully is a movie about people NOT drifting, not aimless, NOT lost, which is entirely not the point of &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. Not everything in this world has to happen fast enough for the shake-your-foot gum-chewing impatient. And Bill Murray IS allowed - thankfully - to do movies befitting his maturity and the subtlety of which he's capable. <br />For the more perceptive, watch the scenes closely. Get the mood. You'll be supremely rewarded.<br />For the others, rent &quot;Dude Where's My Car&quot; or &quot;American Wedding&quot;. And there are still the Farrelly brothers for those who want that kind of thing. Owen Wilson and Ben Stiller are - in their movies - fantastically funny by the way. But that's not what this was meant to be. It's immature to throw a hissy fit because of that.
B000063S6Z|2.0|Ok, first off, \\"18\\" is nothing like what you might expect from his smash-album \\"Play\\"...so...don't think of it like that or it will not satisfy you at all.  18 is one of the most \\"relaxed\\" albums that I've heard Moby put out since \\"Ambient\\".  It has the same vocal expectations that you heard from Play with it's gospel/soul vocals along with some very fin piano/keyboard melodies.  It starts off with 'We Are All Made Of Stars\\" which relates, in Moby's words, how we are all made up of stars if you read the right text book readings.  'In This World' stands out as a beautiful track, even more so if you've seen the video on the 18 DVD (buy \\"18 B Sides + DVD\\" to view it).  Most of the tracks on 18 though are more weaker from what they could've really become in the long run.  First off with making the song more exciting, or at least more enthusiastic and not dull (somewhat) like in songs 'Great Escape' and the others that you might know from what I've said so far.  'Extreme Ways' was one of the most powerful songs in the bunch.  the song '18' has to be one of the most visionary and emotional tunes that I've heard since 'Love Theme' on his earlier album 'I Like To Score, Vol 1\\".  It's a nice \\"start-over\\" for those who are tired from \\"Play\\".<br /><br />That's my review, thanks!
B00005MM67|5.0|This movie does a fantastic job of showing the bond between two friends whose relationship centers on climbing.  The friendship gets pushed to extremes by circumstances, and this shows us more about the characters and their relationship.  The cinematography is the best I've ever seen- you will feel like you're really up in the mountains!  While major liberties were taken, there was enough in the story to show that it was based, very loosely, on the first American ascent of K2, best chronicled in &quot;Last Step: The American Ascent of K2&quot; by Rick Ridgeway.  While not necessary, having read that book further enhanced my enjoyment of this movie.
0316666343|5.0|This is a great book to read. Along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, this is the best book I've read in five years. A highly original concept, with excellent writing, this book is meant to be a classic. For once, a book with a lot of hype turned out to be worth it.
B00003CXSP|1.0|I understand that the book deals with WHY Dr Lector a brilliant, incisive, and no doubt at one time a kind and gentle man and physician went so insane so as to crave human flesh. <BR>   This could no doubt been a wonderfull base to build on but instead this movie ended up being a grossfest with Hannibal convincing the other bad guy at one time to cut his face off as a punishment for his crimes against children, slicing open a Italian detective and pushing him on a type of closeline out to hang over the city like Judas hung from the tree after his betrayal. And the raison d etre, drugging Ray Liotta, cutting open his skull and slowly slicing parts of his brain off, sauting them in a pan and then feeding them to the soon to be lobotomized crooked cop, who in his stupor thinks its delicious.<br />Yuck. Fooey.
0448060191|5.0|This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women. You know it's a great book when it can still be read with the same joy that has thrilled readers for decades and decades. This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy.
B000060P79|2.0|Why only two stars?<BR>Because it's too simple for me.  The guitar chords are basic, the lyrics<BR>are tiring, the singer's voice is whiney, and so on and so forth.  However,<BR>I do find that there's more groups than just Simple Plan producing these types of records: New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, etc.  And I <BR>personally enjoy Simple Plan's album to the two groups  mentioned<BR>previously.  Why?  Just because their album has catchier songs that<BR>are just fun to listen to... but not all the time.
B000005IS1|5.0|In the late sixties, detriot was full of similiar bands, but MC5 had something they didnt. Anger towards authority. This anger really comes accross in their music, especially kick out the jams. This made them the loudest, fastest and most pissed off of all the detriot bands. MC5 were trying to start a revolution, tired of hipies who spoke of peace and love and said how bad everything was but did nothing to try and change it, MC5, in their opening speach, try and urge people to become &quot;part of the solution&quot;. MC5's influence can not be overstated. Music today would be totally different, were it not for MC5. They created punk, strongly influenced the first metal bands and recorded some damn good songs. These guys were true revolutionaries. The CIA even kept them under surveliance!<br />Hightlights of this album are rambling rose, starship, I want you right now and of course, kick out the jams. MC5 play with such energy that they one of the best bands to &quot;rock out&quot; to. Musically, back in the USA is better than this, but the energy, the attitude and the revolutionary speach at the begining elevate this above back in the USA. Dont believe those who tell you that the ramones started punk, punk is not about pop songs about girls and sniffing glue. Loud, fast and pissed off at their government, their country and society in general, they were the first true punk rockers. You cannot call yourself a punk if you do not have this record.<br />One of the best live albums ever. Certainly the most underated album of the sixties.
B00000K3CR|3.0|Doesn't every child? Well, if you are a child, and have watched this movie, you have probably changed your mind by now! And if you're an adult, then you will identify with a lot in this movie. That is, if you're watching it with your eyes open.<br />The movie starts off by making everyone reminisce (well, NOW anyway) by showing the old games, which you thought were state-of-the-art at the time! Now you see them, and you see rubbish graphics, and you had to type what you wanted the characters to do - I remember those! And the film quickly goes on from there.<br />I'm not sure what it was about the movie, but I wasn't all that keen on it. It seems to drag in the middle, and the whole idea of the movie is forgotton. The mum isn't included as much, it would have been nice to maybe see Tom Hanks come back and see her again, instead of just phoning her. My other quibble is that it's only rated a PG - so much more could have been done with the movie, if it had been a 15, maybe NOT an 18. But I guess they were aiming at the kids, so putting it in some (funny) sex scenes would have not been allowed. Boo.<br />Tom Hanks is perfect as the kid in a man's body - to me, he seems all arms and legs, awkward and gangly.<br />An OK movie - not one I would watch again, so it's probably good I got it for free!!! ;)
B00005JGAB|3.0|the Ramones are not the creators of punk rock. Punk music is something the ramones took the credit for, but didnt create. Punk had been going for almost ten years when the ramones came along. The ramones are hardly even a rock band. They are punk pop if anything, but they didnt even create that. I'm fed up of people telling me that the ramones are the defining punk band, they are not! JohnyRamone is a republican for god's sake! Punk is more than just fast rock and roll, mixed with pop. Saying that though, they were a fairly strong influence on some punk rock bands such as the pistols, so they did contribute something to punk history. And the music itself is classic pop punk which is extremely catchy.
B00006JKOL|4.0|Jethro Tull were very productive in the 1970`s. This 1975 album is among their finest of that period; and none are bad.<br />The music can be difficult to give a narrow description; somewhere between progressive rock and folk.<br />Title track opens the album; it`s a good song, but maybe a bit too long.<br />&quot;Cold Wind to Valhalla&quot; - is oaky too, though not particularly memorable.<br />For me the album first really starts with the terrific &quot;One White Duck on The Wall&quot; - great melody - beautiful guitar sounds.<br />Then the &quot;Baker St. Muse - suite&quot; : Several great passages! especially &quot;Mother England Reverie&quot; ( One day I`ll be a minstrel in the gallery .. )<br />The first two bonus-track are also very good - great additions to a good album.

B00005JN1L|4.0|... I think this is another typically odd Johnny Depp movie worth your time & money.  It is not fast-moving, but psychological.  The logline should be:  \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" -- or \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" -- meets \\"The Children of the Corn.\\"
B00013F38K|5.0|I too love Bruce Lee, but this series was not just about the Kung Fu, and I've fallen totally in love with David Carradine over the years.  Based on seeing Bruce Lee in other roles, I think I would not prefer to see him as Kwai Chang Caine.  As an Indian, I did think casting Ben Kingsley as Gandhi was ridiculous, but he did a fantastic job on the role, and while I rejoice in seeing Naveen Andrews in the English Patient or Parminder Nagra on prime time in ER, its the same with acting as with writing -- great writers don't only write autobiographies about what they directly live and experience.  The same with great actors -- they play roles well, and not always what they are born as.<br />So regardless, I love this series, the message is always uplifting, and the opposite of racism and discrimination. And to think that they actually had a non-white theme to a series barely a decade after forced desegregation in parts of this country, was a step in the right direction.  So jcc while I get your message, this is fantastic!
630280082X|5.0|I saw this movie when it came out on VHS format and just loved it. I really enjoyed the music, even though the plot was a little weak, it picked up the pace with the different styles of blues musicians. I particuarly loved the ending and Steve Vai. Ry Cooder... enough said. Just a stupendous display of musical prowess. Now the good news, I recently wrote a letter to Jeff Blake at the Columbia TriStar Home Videos and asked when they were going to put this movie on DVD. To my amazement, a letter back within a week from Michal Stadford, Vice President of DVD Programming and Content and he replied &quot;release date of August 26th (2004). Wow. I am impressed. I hope the DVD comes out in 5.1 surround sound, because this is really going to rock the house. I think this will be worth the price to see in this media mode.
0060920084|3.0|Bryson's &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; isn't his best work, but it's still pretty good.  Compared to his other books (I've read &quot;In a Sunburned Country&quot; and &quot;A Walk in the Woods&quot;), this one doesn't seem to have much of a spark.  It feels like he wrote it more for himself, and less for his readers, as a way to reacquaint himself with the United States after a 10-year stint in England.  That said, I enjoyed reading &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; all the same.  Sure, his bleating and whining about American foibles gets a little old, but his sense of humor and poignant observations are classic Bryson:  just good, clean cantankerous fun.  If you're looking for a great piece of travel writing, I don't recommend &quot;The Lost Continent.&quot;  Nor will you like it if you're thin-skinned about American criticism.  But if you want a quick and enjoyable read, with plenty of humorous tales, then Bryson, as usual, won't disappoint you here.
B00008H2LB|4.0|i have 2 say that this album didnt liv up 2 hybrid theory. but this album is pretty good neway. and about the lyrics, sure they were sorta i dunno &quot;unvocabish&quot; who wants 2 listen 2 pretty little poetic lyrics wen their f***in mad?! i think linkin park duz a good job w/ their lyrics. and i think lp made the album for all ages, so why shud we care if little tweens listen 2 it. sure its degrading at furst but den again once u think about neone can feel hurt and lost, especiall the little kids who r goin thru their little self-finding and depression life stage or wutever. yea. if yer like new or wutever 2 linkin park buy hybrid theory.
B00019PDKC|5.0|I think this is the album which really makes me wonder why and how come this band is as unnoticed as it is. They've evolved with times. If you call this a commerical sound then your wrong. The entire theme around the album and the atmosphere is quite electrifying.<br />Stand out tracks:- Were quite a few but my favourites are<br />&quot;ARE YOU THERE&quot; &quot;HARMONIUM&quot; and &quot;FLYING&quot;. I've been listening to this album for quite a while now. And from the moment I popped it in to my discman , I've liked it more and more.<br />Its nothing like Judgement and there is a varying sound but overall it hits! Definitely worth a buy!<br />Its slowly becoming by favourite ANATHEMA album.<br />The haunting lyrics are still not forgotten,<br />&quot;Since you've been gone , I've been lost in time.....&quot;<br />What is truly amazing about this band is the fact that they say so much without saying as much as they want! &quot;These days my hands are tied...these days I think you'll find....Im not me....now&quot;
B00006RINF|5.0|why the hell do u people watch mtv wen every1 knows they overrate total crap (not that evanescence is total crap)
B00012FXAE|4.0|I am forced to give this DVD 4 stars because it is probably the best sci-fi sequel of all time (forgive me, George, Empire Strikes Back is a close second).  However, it peeves me when a rerelease that is supposed to be of higher quality comes out and the sound is untouched.  I already own the disc and would not buy another when the sound has not been upgraded to DTS, et al.  I was accused of being an &quot;audiophile&quot; way back in the days of vinyl (that is one who is more interested in tweeking expensive equipment than listening to music) and this could be true.  However, sound is at least 1/2 of the home theater experience and it should never be ignored.
B000089RVX|5.0|dis is a great album LIKE comalies. i reely dont get why u all r dissing evanescence so much. and for u all &quot;anti-goth&quot; people, its cuz of u friggin people that little kids get depressed and slash their wrists. maybe all u freaks who dont like evanescence shud leave all the sad little kids alone and if u hate evanescence, why spend time writin a review on it. let the depressed little kids be for gods sake its just a friggin part of life thats natural for kids. i wud kno my little sister is just entering the stage. so all u people shut up and listen 2 wutever music u like. In my opinion, let the little kids wear ungodly amounts of eyeliner and dress in wutever they want, theyll grow out of it. n btw evanescence sounds NOTHING like linkin park wen did lp start singing about watching purple skies and candy clouds fly over them. if they did sry i mustve missed it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It's hard to add anything to what's been said here. All I can say is, if you think you don't like science fiction, or if you think you don't like Westerns, or if you can't imagine a successful cross-hybridization of the two, you haven't seen this. Joss Whedon has created a lush, detail-filled world that could have gone on for years and never repeated itself, and if this set has a drawback it's that after 14 episodes you will be devastated that there are no more. It's simply brilliant, from the special effects to the acting to the scoring to the writing. I cannot wait for the film to come out, and if anyone could turn a TV show into a film into a TV show again, Joss Whedon could. Go, Joss! We love you, man.
B00004Z459|5.0|mike is not the bass player its a guy named pheonix. and linkin park is great.
0783110871|4.0|Here is one of those movies of the &quot;terror at 35,000 feet&quot; variety that is far more entertaining than the plot might indicate.  It's good for a wild ride on a Friday night when you have idle time.<br />The film centers around a prison transport of two violent malefactors.  The flight is coast-to-coast and there are barely any passengers.  In addition to the 2 criminals are 4 U.S. Marshalls who serve as escorts.  Unfortunately for the passengers and crew, the Marshalls turn out to be incompetent while the criminals are far more clever than they look.<br />What ensues is sheer chaos high above the clouds.  To make matters worse, the plane is also going thru a violent thunderstorm (the special effects in this area alone are worth the cost of the DVD).<br />Ultimately, the biggest reason to watch this film is the cast.  The dynamic Ray Liotta plays an enigmatic and ambiguous character that is difficult to place your finger on.  The lovely Lauren Holly plays Bambi the flight attendant and the venerable Ben Cross portrays a righteous 747 pilot.<br />If you like movies such as EXECUTIVE DECISION, AIR FORCE ONE and the AIRPORT disaster movies of the 1970s, give this one a try.  It belongs to the same genre and is at least as good as all of them.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you don't think this album is 5 stars, leave this site and stop poisoning the music waters.  This album is so well written that it still ranks as #1 on some charts for the greatest album of all time.
B00018D44U|4.0|I used to judge her too much 'cause I didn't understand why this very new artists got so many Grammy's and a ton of platinum album sales...it just didn't make since. So I judged her and thought her music was stupid...that is until I picked up her new CD. I like the single &quot;Sunrise&quot; and I realized that her music style is the kind that I somewhat like. It's really peaceful and soothing. It's something you can sleep to and wind down to. It's just hard to know when a song ends and starts again 'cause most of the songs sound alike.
B00005JM20|4.0|Listen all you adult-aged reviewers, let's loosen up here. This movie is not for movie connoiseurs. This movie is for getting laughs. And if you insist on holding a prissy, stuck-up attitude then you just won't have a good time, period.<br />Us pursed-lip adults sometimes have to relax, let our facial muscles go(lower those eyebrows, unfurrow the forehead, unpurse our lips, and unclench our jaws) and let humor, even slapstick humor, get the best of us. Some of us are so full of our previous knowledge of movie-viewing or Mr. Bean and Atkinson material(&quot;I saw this and I saw that and this movie just ain't as blablabla&quot; or &quot;Atkinson ain't as good in this as in yadayada...&quot;).<br />Children don't care about the history of movies and Atkinson tv series. Watch kids enjoy this movie. They know how to have a good time in the moment. My kids were in stitches over Atkinson's antics and all his facial expressions.<br />My husband got a good share of laughs, sometimes to the point of tears---and it is good to see my husband laugh even if it is over Johnny English. Myself? I have to admit I laughed too. And how could I not enjoy myself with my kids  dancing around during Rowan's little mini music video with his toothbrushes in the shower? We rewinded the movie 3 times just to watch that part over and over again. Little children don't get tired of rewinding their favorite parts, you know.  One son said we should keep on replaying it until he memorized the song lines. (I insisted we didn't rewind as far back as the unveiling of the Archbishop, though it was their other favorite part of the movie).<br />Leave the movie critic behind you. Watch the movie for laughs. Have a good time viewing it with kids or adults. Don't resist the humor. Relax, enjoy, and let yourself just laugh for humor's sake.
0790729628|2.0|This is or was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Until the directors cut was released. This show is an empty shell without the Fords narrative. I only gave it two stars but I would give the original 6.
B00012QM8G|1.0|I am reviewing the DVD, not the film.<br />Here we have one of the best films of the 1990s, and Spielberg makes it a flipper.  In 2004, the fact that we have to turn this DVD over is moronic, and Spielberg knows better.  The extras are mediocre.  Just think what he could have done, with a documentary on the Holocaust.  Why it took so long to get this DVD in print is beyond me.  And the container is cardboard, and gives no listing of the chapters.  The so-called container that holds the inserts is open at the bottom so the inserts fall out.  <br />The DVD concept is one of the marvels of technology in the last decade.  And Spielberg, who prides himself with being technologically advanced, gives us a DVD that could have been made in the early 1990s.  So sad that such a great film gets such a lousy presentation.

B00005Y7L4|3.0|I just bought and watched Battle Royale II from a Megacon show.  I have never seen part 1, but I'm pretty intelligent, so I can figure out what it is about.<BR>As I get the gist of what happened in the 1st movie in the start of this one, this was interesting to watch.  However, I am an American, and therefore, like fast-paced movies and books.<BR>And though this movie is rather fast-paced and action packed, it was overdramatically acted by a couple of its actors, making this comical to watch.<BR>The ACTION SEQUENCES SEEM THE SAME.  That's another bad thing about this movie.  They all seemed choreographed pretty much the same.  Needed more different type of weaponry, and an occasional hand-to-hand - which there is none of!<BR>But I liked this movie, just not as much as I wanted to.<BR>It had great potential with its decent cast and overall very good look to it, along with the cool setting.<BR>It dragged at times, when these newer kids go a-hunting for the surviving kids of the 1st Battle Royale.  Cool idea, not so cool execution.  But still better than a lot of Asian movies I've seen.
0385504209|4.0|I picked up this book one day not ever knowing what it was about or what people thought of it before.  From the moment i picked it up i couldn't put it down.  It was grasping my imagination to see these paintings as something else.  I don't believe that any of it was true, but it was some body elses imagination at work.  This book was nicely done.  All these other people who look to into it to see that it's fiction and that it's not real need to calm down.  Just cause things in here are not accurate does not mean it was not a good book. Not just a good book, an excellent book.  I recommend it to everyone who loves to read those types of books that you just can't put down.
0385504209|4.0|Robert Langdon, a Harvard symbologist, receives an urgent phone call while staying in Paris. The police contact him regarding the murder of Jacques Sauni&egrave;re, curator of the Louvre, who, before dying, leaves a series of clues hidden in Da Vinci's works for Langdon and Sophie Neveu, a French cryptologist, to find.<br />Together they piece the clues to reveal the secret left behind by Sauni&egrave;re. However, seeing Langdon's name written out at the scene of the crime by the victim himself makes him the prime suspect in the murder investigation.<br />The novel is well written in general and filled with fascinating information about Da Vinci and the Priory of Sion. Whether these details are accurate or not, I wouldn't know, but they make for such a fascinating backdrop to the story that I didn't care. I wanted to believe it was true. But this might keep purists or serious art buffs from getting into the art world described by the author. Dan Brown has written a very entertaining novel and, after having read it, I understand why it has been on the Top 10 list for over 40 weeks. Some of the story lines are quite predictable and you will see the inevitable pages before the author gets to it, but luckily none of these elements are part of the main storyline.<br />I can't recommend this book enough.
0790729628|4.0|I agree with many that the original theatrical release with the Ford narration and &quot;uplifting&quot; ending is superior. As gifted as Ridley Scott is, even the greatest of artists aren't always as objective as they ought to be. The Director's Cut is a clear example of that.<br />I might remind anyone reading this that the &quot;cult following&quot; that the film has gained since its original, unsuccessful 1982 release really occured BEFORE the Director's Cut became available. Simply put, Blade Runner newbies just can't &quot;get into&quot; this edit/cut. Ford's narration engages the first-time viewer with important exposition and emotional depth while they are being visually saturated with the beautiful production ideas and timeless FX. The review just before mine made a great point as well with the V.O. providing that noir, &quot;detective&quot; film feel (quite a unique concept to make the setting sci-fi without the filmmakers going out of their way to make it &quot;sci-fi.&quot; It's as though Scott brilliantly realized that the film would be most effective if he just approached it as if THIS was our own world). Plus, without the V.O., we just don't really get a feel for Ford's character; he literally has about the least amount of on-the-set dialog I've seen a major star have since Arnold in the first Terminator. It's just too detached; maybe, that's the point, but I certainly like to &quot;feel&quot; for my characters.<br />Recommendation: seek out the original theatrical release first, and then, if you're hooked, check out the DC. <br />If I could rate the film more accurately out of five stars:<br />Theatrical Release ****1/2<BR>Director's Cut ***1/2
B0000E6I1J|5.0|What a wonderful, emotional, f****** great concert and tribute to George. I have both the DVD and CD.  Can't stop listening to it.  It's hard to pick a favorite song, but &quot;My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; and &quot;Horse To Water&quot; are my favorites, next is &quot;Something&quot; by Paul.  I am really disappointed that Sam Brown's &quot;Horse To Water&quot; didn't make it to the CD. She was the best, and I'm a new fan!  I'm waiting for someone to offer &quot;Horse to Water&quot; from the concert as a download for those of us wanting it on a CD. Olivia and Dhani please release it on CD for us.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|i am surprised to see that Lost in Translation has such low review on Amazon while School of Rock has such high review.  In my own opinion, Lost in Translation has a lot of silent wisdom in it, while School of Rock is just &quot;form over matter&quot;...  [warning: movie spoiler ahead....]  Just lying to a bunch of kids to fulfill his dream of forming a rock band because nobody else wanted him...  how ungraceful is that... and the school principal, at times posing as silly kind of authoratative figure, and at time posing as &quot;admiring&quot; your rock band kind of silly figure.  Lost in Translation is more for you if you can stand to be with someone you like for a few hours like sitting next to each other and reading books.  School of Rock is for you if you like noisy and meaningless conversation.  on the IMDBwebsite, the score for these two movies are more just: Lost in Translation is above School of Rock, and is one of the top 250 movies ever made.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney new CD \\"In The Zone\\" has not left my CD player since November. Being a dance student I'm very grateful for Britney as she keeps me on my toes and makes me practice outside of Dance school. Vocally, Britney is no Celine Dion but beat-wise no one does it better than her, although Madonna & Michael are right on her heels.<br />Me Against The Music - 5/5 I love this song, especially the part where she sings \\"With the beat of the drum, gotta keep with that bass\\" and also I love the \\"Hey Britney...\\" part Madonna sings.<br />(I Got That) Boom Boom - 5/5 This song rocks, especially the banjo in it, the Ying Yang Twins are pretty good in it too, which surprised me because I normally hate their music.<br />Showdown - 4/5, This song has a great beat to it, lyrically it's a little sub-par, but it's still good. A more of a cool down dance song then a pack the dance floors dance song.<br />Breathe On Me - 4/5 I don't understand why people say this song would pack club dance floors. To me it's extremely catchy but the beat is too slow to dance to, well at least a non-sexual dance.<br />Early Mornin' - 5/5 The BEST song on the disc, I love the trancy feel to it. This is still a dance song but more of a cool down not a get your groove on song, but it's insanely catchy.<br />Toxic - 4/5, Ahhh, Britney's most popular song since Oops!...I Did It Again. This song is extremely catchy, especially the Stockholm Strings Session on it. A pretty good dance song.<br />Outrageous - 3/5 This song is catchy and gets stuck in your head but I dunno, I'm not really feelin' this one; although it is a great song to dance to.<br />Touch of My Hand - 5/5, I love the asian feel to it, very Ray of Light/Frozen-y. I thought it was very tastefully done.<br />Shadow - 4/5 A really nice song, obviously you can't dance to it but none the less it's very nice.<br />The Hook Up - 2/5, E[...] This song is danceable but I don't dance to it. I can't stand it. The only Filler song on the disc IMO. This shouldhave been replaced with the unreleased song \\"I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)\\"<br />Brave New Girl - 5/5, very risqué topic but I love the techno-y feel to it. Britney also makes a fairly good rapper.<br />Everytime - 5/5, Ahh, Britney's new song, the song which finds herself commiting suicide in the video. A very beautiful, haunting song. I love this song.<br />Me Against The Music [Remix] - 4/5, I think this song is just filler but It's got an awsome middle-eastren feel to it which actually makes it more danceable to than the original cut.<br />People who say that Christina/Norah/Celine etc are better or whatever need to grow up. Britney and all them are completely different. She never said she was gonna right deep meaningfull lyrics like \\"I'm OK\\" by Christina or wow us at the Piano like Norah or belt out a tune like Celine. Britney has done nothing more or less than craft an amazing dance CD thats main goal is to get you to shake your bon-bon.<br />I believe this CD is 4/5 stars but since I think it should be 4 I'm giving it 5 so it'll help raise the avg. rating of it to 4 faster than if I were to give it the 4 it deserves.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Continuing to be entrenched in an existentialist stronghold, Sofia Coppola presents us with a great script coupled with impeccable acting by Bill Murray, splendid photography and an enviable soundtrack to go with it all: a perfect combination, if you ask me!<br />The story deservedly earned Ms. Coppola (who was also the first American woman ever nominated for the Academy Award as a Director) an Oscar for best original script in 2004. The story takes place in Tokyo, a strange culture that results almost extraterrestrial at first to the legendary actor Bob Harris (played by Murray), now reduced to touring exotic locations and venues and doing luxury drink commercials, and young and beautiful Charlotte (played by Scarlett Johansson). Both are stranded in this faraway land: he (over 50), being away from his family in the US, and undergoing a middle age crisis; and she (just over 20, fresh out of school and not being married for too long), also &quot;distant&quot; (yet physically close) from her husband who she's accompanying in Tokyo on a business trip, while she tries to figure out what to make of her life, after four years of Philosophy in college. The two, in the midst of their own particular crises, connect and a unique chemistry builds up between them that will capture you and leave you thinking, regardless of which of their ages you're closer to.<br />Murray's acting, with a very subtle sense of humor, takes the story to a level that not many other actors could, balancing his internal conflicts with the ability to laugh at himself and life at large, when things don't turn out as he'd like them to. A hilarious moment for history in this movie is his struggle when dealing with his wife's suggestion that they pick burgundy for the color of a new carpet back home, while in front of a whole group of red-looking samples, not having a clue which one she means as THE burgundy sample. Impossible not to crack up, since most men will not be able to tell tones of red appart from each other (and even if we did, most of the time we don't really care what color things are, anyway).<br />Photography and music bring an added art element to the movie that is impossible to overlook. The lights and visual elements in Tokyo help capture some breathtaking moments that transport the user to places remote for most of us, in a very surreal way. The music helps build atmospheres in ways that approach perfection: it's a great continuation of the effect Ms. Coppola accomplished in Virgin Suicides, a movie that French duo Air masterfully scored. In 'Lost in Translation', Air participates once again, this time alongside Kevin Shields (My Bloddy Valentine), Death in Vegas, Jesus &amp; Mary Chain and a handful of others to assemble a powerful and eclectic soundtrack that provides an unforgettable musical frame to the rest of the art of the movie.<br />Without a doubt, among the best movies of 2003.rom each other (and even if we did, most of the time we don't really care what color things are, anyway).<br />Photography and music bring an added art element to the movie that is impossible to overlook.

0385510438|1.0|This is by far the worst Grisham yet.  Too many Good Ole Boys, Bubbas and babbling. Absolutely no suspense, drama or reason to continue reading. Fall asleep on the front porch of an historic falling-down old home in a boring small town with this one. Let's hope Grisham hangs up his lucrative contractual hat with this bomb. Pass this up for almost any David Baldacci or Dan Brown read you can get your hands on.

B00005JMKI|4.0|WARNING.  WHAT YOU SEE in \\"Dogville\\" is very strange.  The town of \\"Dogville\\" is made with only the minimal sets and props, put on the darkly-lit soundstage.  The \\"houses\\" have no walls or doors; the \\"streets\\" are just the white lines drawn on the ground with the name in between; and even the dog is represented by the white drawing with \\"DOG\\" beside it.  The film thus looks like a stage drama, and you are watching it through the camera on the stage.  And the film, shot with a hand-held DV camera, goes as much as three hours.  Prepare for that. <br />THE STORY is based on a brief scene in a Brecht drama, \\"Threepenny Opera,\\" but just forget about it.  \\"Dogville\\" follows a female fugitive named Grace (Nicole Kidman), who seeks for a hiding place in the small town of Dogville.  A young wannabe writer Tom is the first to help her, but he and Grace have to get the approval from all the townspeople to let her stay.  As if in a game, it is decided that Grace has to win the favor of the people by doing whatever she can do for them, the chores for starters.<br />Grace does it, and finally can live in the community, but as she stays longer there, the locals starts to want more from her, never being satisfied with what she offers, and the film leads them to the ending full of impact.  About the rest of the film, you should see for yourself; either you are enthralled with it, or utterly shocked and disgusted.<br />ABOUT THE CAST; the cast is unanimously good, and the names here are quite impressive.  Paul Bettany (as Tom), Chloe Sevigny, Lauren Bacall, Patricia Clarkson, Ben Gazzara, Jeremy Davies, Stellan Skarsgard, Philip Baker Hall, Harriet Andersson, and Blair Brown.  You also see the regular of the director Lars von Trier, Udo Kier and Jean Marc Barr as cameo, plus James Caan whose role reminds us of one Coppola film he was in.  John Hurt also provides the narration.<br />THE DIRECTOR LARS VON TRIER is famous for the dark contents of his films -- see \\"Breaking the Waves\\" orparticularly \\"Dancers in the Dark\\" -- and he doesn't seem to have changed.  \\"Dogville\\" is full of such elements that would make you hate the human beings, and moreover, is supposed to be the first part of director's trilogy about America.  (Which means two more are coming....)  However, to be fair, the \\"Dogville\\" can be anywhere in the world, having the universal theme on the darker side of humans.  The point is, either you like it or not, which I would be never sure of.  If you dislike it, keep this in mind; Lars von Trier has never been to America in his life, and the \\"America\\" is his America.  (In fact \\"Dogville\\" was shot in Sweden.)         <br />THE CONTENTS are strongly presented, and the acting of Nicole Kidman is brilliant, but the three hours is certainly too long; besides, we have too many words which do not always work.  Actually, it is the fine acting of the cast that drive the story forth with considerable emotioal power, and though the each character's development is far from smooth (especially the relation between Grace and Tom is weakly drawn), each sequence is effectively shown with ardently done works from everyone.<br />Look at this film as you do at theatre.  \\"Dogville\\" requires your patience, but to many who wants to see thought-provoking or challenging film, this is rewarding experience.  But don't you ever expect from Nicole Kidman's name love or romance,  They are least likely to be found in this town.
0385504209|2.0|The Da Vinci Code has dominated the NYT best-seller list for weeks and weeks, but it's a little hard to see why.  Yes, it's entertaining.  But I find cloaking the mystery in a pseudo-intellectual romp through art history and church history a little tedious (the inaccuracies have rightly been pointed out).  More to the point--and what I haven't seen mentioned in other Amazon reviews--is that the writing is labored, contrived, and frequently cliche-ridden.  There are far too many cliff-hangers; the device becomes tiresome.  As a puzzle, I found the book more maddening than fun.  At one point, two quite intelligent characters are utterly bamboozled by something I saw immediately, and that wasn't so surprising in a book whose backdrop is Leonardo da Vinci (I won't say more in case you read this book yourself).<br />  The tale is too complex, and so it bogs down.  It's not surprising that people find the ending a bit of a let-down; Brown writes himself into a terrible corner with not much of a way to get out.<br />  Perhaps the appeal is the idea that &quot;people who know&quot; are keeping things from us:  sooner or later, we're all attracted to a good conspiracy.  Those who read this book and forget that the work is ENTIRELY fiction are not all to blame:  the story is couched in believable--if preposterous--terms.  But don't be fooled.  There is very little genuine history here.  Leonardo did write backwards in his notebooks, and the Mona Lisa is an intriguing painting (speculation about its subject has been rampant all through art history).  There was a Priory of Sion and Templar Knights, and Opus Dei and the Catholic Church are of course real.  The rest is pretty much the work of the author's imagination.<br />  Read it for fun--if you don't start getting an aneurism from all the cliff-hangers--but don't think you're reading serious symbology, iconography, art history, or any truth about ancient secret societies.  And if you must read it, borrow a copy from the library or from a friend who's through with it.  Everyone has made enough money off of this bunkum for now.ary or from a friend who's through with it.  Everyone has made enough money off of this bunkum for now.
B000059T00|5.0|This album has some kind of slow stuff, but the really good stuff outwheighs it. I see that they've changed the cover to be more politically correct. <BR>Definitely good, I wish &quot;Do what you like&quot; had a shorter drum solo so that the could have fit more songs on the disc, but oh well.<br />Trevor
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I had never heard of Gavin until I saw him open for Barenaked Ladies and WOW.  He blew them away, hands down.  His music was extremely catchy and the crowd really seemed to love him and his music.  His voice is strong and his lyrics (which he writes himself) are catchy and worth singing along too (like you could even help it!)  Gavin DeGraw is definitely going places.  He has a very bright future ahead of him.  As for this album, I LOVE every single song and only wish I could find a live version of this cd.  I can't wait for a follow up album.  If you like catchy sing along songs, buy this album.
B00008PX8P|5.0|This dvd is about five hours and twenty minutes, so it's not likely that you'll sit through it, but all the same, this is an excellent compilation of old stuff (disc one) and newer stuff (disc two). I am a guitar freak, so I mainly pay attention to what Jimmy Page is doing, but Bonzo was pretty amazing too. I had to wince in the second disc a whole bunch of times when they kept taking a whole bunch of closeups of Robert Plant. The first disc starts out with \\"We're Gonna Groove\\" which is a rather rare song of theirs and then morphs into \\"I can't quit you Babe\\", then comes \\"Dazed and Confuzed\\" NOTE: THIS SONG IS WORTH THE PRICE OF THE DVD The guitar solo in this song is amazing to see live, because of the violin bow parts. First Jimmy Page plays some melancholy sounding chords and then he turns on his delay and starts whacking the strings with the bow. Then he goes and uses a  Vox Wah-wah to make a very unique sound. <BR>Next on the first disc was \\"White Summer\\" which is pretty much a  ten-minute fingerpicking guitar solo (played on a Danelectro). Other highlights on the first disc are \\"Whole Lotta Love\\", \\"Moby Dick\\", in which Bonzo plays a fifteen minute drum solo, and \\"Bring it on Home\\" which is played on a three pickup Les Paul Custom after Page broke a string during an earlier song (Communication breakdown, I think). This Les Paul Custom has more crunch than any other guitar I have heard.<br />Disc two starts out with an epillepsy-inspiring version of \\"The Immigrant Song\\". It then goes to \\"Black Dog\\" and \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\". \\"The Ocean\\" is played, starting of with Bonzo's favorite drinking song, and then they play some other stuff like \\"Nobody's fault but mine\\", and \\"Stairway to heaven\\". It finishes off with a new version of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\"<br />All in all, a great selection.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I love this movie, it was on T.V once when I was about 7 or 8 and we taped it, but as the other reviews have said it was dark and a bit weird for little kids so my mum taped over it because my 4 year old brother got nightmares.  It was the worst mistake my mum could have made.  Im 19 now and have always wanted it to come back on TV but it never did. In the last fews days after seeing The Wizard of Oz (That I have seen 30+ times) I decided to look on the net to see if I could buy Return To Oz.  BUT you can't buy it anywhere in Australia, and there is not point buying it from the USA because I can't play it on my DVD player beacuse Return To Oz needs Region 1 to be able to play.  But if you can buy this please do it is the best movie ever!!!!
B000001FGG|5.0|This is an amazing album. It starts of with &quot;White Room&quot; which is a stunningly great song, then goes into the bluesy &quot;On top of the world&quot;. &quot;Passing the Time&quot; is sort of drawn out, but still is pretty good (I'm not sure if they actually had a cellist recording with them, or if that's a synth cello, but it's still pretty cool. The bizzare-ness of the album peaks out at &quot;Pressed Rat and Warthog&quot; which has rather interesting lyrics.<BR>I strongly suggest this album.
0451169514|5.0|Seven nerdy-but-likable children, a psychotic clown, and the timelessness of childhood.  These are all issues tackled by Stephen King's \\"It\\".  Although quite lengthy (1100+ pages), it certainly doesn't feel that way when you sit down to read the book.  The scenes are well sculpted, weaving together the events bewtween the Derry, Maine of 1958 and the Derry of 1985.  All of the characters are well developed, and there's enough creepy stuff to keep you riveted.  There are some more \\"adult\\" concepts(detailed sexual scenes), so I wouldn't advise it for younger children as a bedtime story, but for the mature reader looking for a thrill, it's a definate read.

B00014NE62|5.0|Merchant-Ivory have often been made fun of for being stuffy and repressed. I don't agree but I understand why they've been parodied. In Maurice, however, the team created something very special--an incredibly lyrical, heartfelt love story. This movie haunted me long after I saw it when it was released, and it's just as haunting now. The performances are simply grand. I wish Hugh Grant would do a dramatic role again to get rid of his mannerisms. Wilby is particularly fine, when you consider this was his first film. I've never seen Graves give a bad performance. I'm so glad to see this on DVD. Would this film be a bigger hit in the theaters if it were released now? I think so.
0792165020|5.0|Hundreds of reviewers have commented on the beauty of the film and the setting, and the juggling of persona's that make the 2nd half such a pot-boiler. <br />Well, All that's true.  Jude Law and Gwyneth are as close to Greek gods as anyone on the screen in decades. But the thing that makes this movie so different than other, lesser mysteries is Matt Damon's Ripley.  He's living on the fringe of society and as events unfold, he falls out of 'normal space' and becomes a full-fledged sociopath.  <br />It's the transformation which is so rare to see on film, and which is so heartbreaking, because we know Ripley wanted to fly right and is fully aware of his own downfall.  He's likeable even as a monster, and, like watching a car crash, I couldn't look away.<BR>  The film was not unlike watching somebody bluff at poker and continue to win against mounting odds.  The chutzpa / cajones required to go down that path were either amazing or pathological - more likely the latter. <BR>In the end he's forced to kill his male suitor and it becomes clear that there's no place left for him in normal society.  He's tainted.  I wanted him captured, not just because he was so dangerous but also because he was unhappily living a lie.  He had lost the real game of life and was inventing an alternate reality which had no chance and caused him constant psychic pain. In the end his only escape was prison or the grave.
B00005JN1L|4.0|'Secret Window' wasn't as good as I expected, but that's just because it wasn't the film I thought it was going to be. The trailers for the movie make it look full of action, and very scary, which is slightly misleading. The film starts quite slow, but Johnny Depp manages to carry it well (with a less talented actor, the movie would probably have been 3 stars, maybe even lower). There were some frightening moments, but none that really affected me or that I remembered. In fact, the film was actually more gory than it was scary.<br />Johnny Depp's acting is, of course, superb which really brings the rating of the movie up. I actually enjoyed the comedic moments in the movie quite a bit more than the 'horrific' parts. I liked the plot, and the ending, but I found that I predicted the ending slightly earlier in the film than I usually do. I would probably recommend waiting and renting this film. It's much cheaper than spending what seems like a fortune nowadays to see it in theaters. Not seeing it on the big screen isn't a huge downfall either, as there isn't a lot of action.

I've read reviews referring to how \\"country\\" it is, but it is only country in as much as country music has been influenced by the blues.  Her voice is unmatched. I cannot see how anyone who enjoyed \\"Come Away With Me\\" could not like this one as well.

This book reveals the imperfections of a \\"perfect society\\" (as it is revealed in Gathering Blue), and the concept of this book provokes thought and reflection. It's on a reading level that is not difficult and can be read in a day or more. This book is definitely one of my favorites.

B00004RFCM|5.0|Sex and the City rules from a male perspective. I started watching Sex and the City with my mother when it first aired and have not be disappointed by the show. This review is based on the whole six series of SATC.  All the main characters are honest, funny, and shares a similar desire.  Carrie's character is a sex columnist for a newspaper. Carrie uses her own personal experiences as well as her girlfriends experiences to compose a column about men, women, sex, and relationships. Samantha is extremely sexually active women who works in Public Relations. Miranda is smart, self assured lawyer who is cynical which leaving her to fake her emotions about relationships. Charlotte is prim and proper Park Avenue women who goals are to get married and have a family.<br />The reason why I like SATC is because it give a comedic version on sex and relationships.  No matter what happens to your own social life, you can watch SATC and share the same humorous episode of what Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte did, and learn to laugh a upon at your own situations. These six series will be treasured and revisited by me.
B00009V7RF|5.0|I'm 14 and this is probably one of my favorite bands! I fell in love with BEP the first time I heard \\"Where is the love\\". Fergie's voice dominates this cd. She is an awesome addition to the peas and she is so beautiful. I love each song with a passion. They're all different and great tracks. Very catchy songs. Number one favorite song: Hay mama. If you love that song, the rest will be great. I have to say it's a great cd to shake your butt to. Will.i.am, awesome! He also adds a lot to this cd too. Overall, 5 stars is less than it deserves, I would give it 6! Buy the cd and enjoy! You won't regret it.
B000127LW2|5.0|Couldn't wait for this to be release.  I only wished they continued a few more seasons of this.  This my favourite Star Trek of all time and one of my all time shows.  The variety of this cast is exceptional and each has their main parts (not being centered around one person all the time).<BR>Not sure what Trek will match this one now ?.<br />Truly amazing.
B00018TI5E|5.0|I am going to keep this short and sweet. I will not review each song one by one. All I have to say is that John's music is amazing. I am blown away by the violence and vulnerability of one song to another. He TRULY has a gift for melody and every song is beautiful and engaging at the same time. There is nothing wrong with this album except for the very few tracks where the music is exclusively computer programmed and the passion of John's brilliant and intelligent vocals and MOST importantly his guitar is not present. Those are the only skipable tracks. The other tracks display John's undisputable musical talent and make this album a privledge to own and impossible not to fall in love with.
B00013PHGS|5.0|Having read a few of these other reviews that disparage this album, I think it important to point out that this is a stand-alone album, and maybe to some it suffered by their expectations, but if you take a listen to this with fresh ears, you will hear that the music and sounds each run deep, and with Nigel Godrich's predictably spectacular production, this album rises to the level of masterpiece, and will absolutely survive the test of time.  I can only speculate that those disappointed listeners have not listened to this music with the prescribed large and hi-fidelity sound.<br />But, back to approaching any album with expecations based on an artist's previous album; it is human nature, but to have a reactionary response is to potentially miss out on something great.  Would these poeople bash Led Zeppelin III?  Kid A (or OK Computer for that matter)?  Would they disavow Dylan's use of electric guitar, or complain when he wrote another folk tune?  Would the bulk of David Bowie's career be ignored because it didn't have the conceptual impact of Ziggy stardust?  Everybody's got personal preferences and tastes, but I defy anyone to articulate a rational argument against the quality of Talkie Walkie.  Most negativity I've read has been tersely worded and base at best.  This is something beautiful.
B00003CXD0|4.0|What a tightly scripted, beautifully acted, finely paced comedy! Having seen it a long time ago, I felt it must've been very much like an older version of Mrs Doubtfire, but this marvellous film has a lot more going for it than the female impersonation angle.<br />When a failing actor cross dresses to get a job, he also discovers the inconveniences of being a &quot;woman of the 80s&quot;. Throughout the film, there's always a pleasing sense of cynical humor (e.g., &quot;I dont believe in hell. I believe in unemployment, but not in hell&quot;) and Hoffman is topnotch in his role.<br />The from Morricone has a somewhat grating refrain of Stephen Bishop's &quot;It might be you&quot; but I guess it perfectly serves its purpose, providing the touching backdrop to the actor's increasing awareness of the strength of feminine qualities -- the touch of the baby to his cheek, the poignant sight of Julie's skirt swishing in the kitchen, the offering to Dorothy of her chocolate-covered finger to suck, etc.<br />I can see that Hoffman must have committed to this movie bigtime, and I notice that there's a book that describes the making of this film but is currently out of print. Perhaps something to this effect would have been great to include on the DVD itself, which is incidentally quite lousy for such a classic film.<br />At any rate, it's a great addition to any movie collection.
B00007JVBI|5.0|This is a great triumph over adversity and tragedy in life.  A mostly mournful--rather than celebratory--acknowledgement of the fact of Freedom.  Listening is like taking that deep breath and deciding to heal a lot of hurt you've been holding.<br />Overall the songs are slow and comtemplative, with a few somewhat-upbeat rock moments (&quot;Free&quot;, &quot;Good For Me&quot;, &quot;He-War&quot;.)  Chan Marshall pairs her clear sad voice with piano, or accoustic guitar, or electric guitar, on different songs.  Guests include David Grohl and Eddie Vedder.<br />The album opens with &quot;I don't blame you&quot;, such a simple and beautiful song.  It rings so true as a classic, you wonder as you listen how it could never have been sung before now.  &quot;Free&quot; is a fun pop-rock venture introducing the word 'free' that will be echoed throughout the album in other pieces.  &quot;Werewolf&quot; (a cover of Michael Hurley 70's acid-folk song) moves almost like a dirge, like a cloud in the sky languidly uncovering a full-moon that we know will transform us into animal.  &quot;Names&quot; moves like a reading of names of holocaust victims, only here it recounts the stories of preteens molested or surviving only through prostitution.  Yet there is no pity, instead more an stoic depiction of reality for some.<br />Every song has its strength, whether depicting a painful or fragile personal weakness, or a leap of faith to heal, or an account of abuse.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|...He actually had the nerve to say that Ashanti is a better artist than Alicia Keys. Well he has obviously never heard her sing live b/c she sounds awful. She is basically a black Britney Spears whose popularity is based mainly on sex appeal. As for Alicia Keys being overhyped-- that may be true but she deserves all of it. Not only can she sing amazingly, she does it while playing the piano (which is extremely hard to do). I saw her concert for her first album and it was great. Even though I didn't like her first cd much, hearing her perform them makes you want to go back and give some songs a second try. Oh and by the way she doesn't sit down at the piano the entire time. She actually gets up and dances.I think people are too quick to judge both her and her second album which is way better than the first. It's one of those cds you have to listen to a couple of times before you really like it but its well worth it. Check out the songs You Don't Know My Name, Diary, If I Ain't Got You, Feelin You, Feelin Me, Samsonite Man, Slow Down, Wake up and track 11 (can't remember the name). And don't just listen to her voice, listen to the music as well and I know you will alos become a fan.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Dream Theater was and is a great band. I don't have their first album.  But I&W was excellent, Awake was a great companion piece to show the darker side.  ACOS was a great song.  Falling into Infinity was disappointing but had good moments like \\"Lines in the Sand\\".  SFAM was great but sometimes the focus was taken off the songs because of the greater idea.  Same for disc 2 of 6DOIT.  Disc 1 was good but could be hard to grasp.<br />That being said \\"Train of Thought\\" is excellent.  It beats out Awake and 6DOIT as the heaviest album DT has ever made.  While it is uniquely heavy and different than what they have done before, it definitely is an extension of what they have done before.  There is the obvious fact that \\"This Dying Soul\\", one of the best cuts, is an extension of \\"The Glass Prison\\" literally.  <br />\\"As I Am\\" is an excellent lead off track.  The beginning kind of reminds me of the beginning of \\"Black Sabbath\\" the song before becoming more punishing than Sabbath is.  <br />\\"This Dying Soul\\" is great.  It is a great way to continue the 12-step program layed out by Mike Portnoy in \\"THe Glass Prison\\".  I especially like where it goes into the time change and John Petrucci starts this new riff between the two parts of the song.<br />\\"Endless Sacrifice\\" is another great song.  The pain that James Labrie expresses in is just heart wrenching.  It is proabaly the most emotional song DT has ever done.  It has similarities to \\"Misunderstood\\" from 6DOIT, but was a lot better in many ways.<br />\\"Honor Thy Father\\" is good.  While I don't rank it as high as the first three it is still a great song about Mike Portnoy's stepfather.<br />\\"Vacant\\" is a really short sad song about feeling alone.  It has the same vibe as \\"Disappear\\" but seems more genuine in emotion.<br />\\"Stream of Consciousness\\" is probably the best instrumental that DT has done, in the vein of Metallica's \\"Orion\\", though very similar to the stuff that John Petrucci, Mike Portnoy and Jordan Rudess did in Liquid Tension Experiment. <br />\\"In the Name of God\\" is a great long diatribe against megalomaniacal religious fanatics.  Makes references to Heaven's Gate and Branch Dividan and talks about how something like religion, which can be wonderful in its purest form can be perverted into something so hateful.  It is one of the best lyrical statements that DT has ever made and was much more successful than \\"The Great Debate\\" from 6DOIT.  <br />This is incredible. I feel like DT was emotionally very expressive on this release.  ToT is a 75 minute catharsis of anger.  FYI, yes there are some nu-metal influence on this record, but it is still a prog record and an old-style metal record with some of those nu-metal influences being embraced and it is pure DT.
B00005A46T|4.0|OK, all the death metal nerd talk aside, this CD is all about driving down the highway and sticking up your middle finger at the guy that just cut you off. Athough their first CD was a little more original and my favorite so far, on &quot;IOWA&quot; they're bringing back a little of the old school thrash sound which is cool too. Sure they're no TOOL but ask any &quot;maggot&quot; and they'll tell you it's all about the experience.... the jumpsuits, the twisted lyrics, the heavyness, the sick masks... they're just @#$%ing cool!
B00008BRDX|4.0|The Police continue their mixture of punk and reggae in their second release, Regatta de Blanc, or White Reggae.  Someone I doubt that it had anything to do with boat races, the other regatta, as the title track is an instrumental exercise punctuated by a rollicking bassline, and various vocalizations Sting and Co., before Andy Summer's guitar joins in the assault.<br />Many songs deal with the angst of alienation and loneliness in an increasingly personalized and post-industrial world, but few match the power, catchy rhythms, and sheer writing skills of \\"Message In A Bottle.\\"  The concept of a castaway sending a message in a bottle in hopes that a passing ship will receive it.  But when one hears \\"Seems I'm not alone at being alone/A hundred billion castaways/Looking for a home,\\" things are mixed, because it's good to know we're not the only one, but in the end, the prospects of being rescued have been greatly reduced.<br />More of a punk sound on the verses of \\"It's Alright For You.\\"  The verses consist of two to three syllable lines sung rapid-fire like Bob Dylan's \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues,\\" but the one thing that pops up some of the verses is the paean to indifference, \\"Stand by/Don't cry/Watching while the world die.\\"<br />Back to reggae on the escapism of \\"Bring On The Night,\\" a title Sting would use for his documentary/concert movie.  A hybrid punk-skiffle sound surrounds the brooding \\"Deathwish,\\" where a nothing-to-lose attitude to an unrewarding life eventually leads to \\"The day I take a bend too fast/.../I'll be wiped right off the slate/Don't wait up 'cause I'll be late.\\"<br />The wooly wishing and daydreaming in \\"Walking On The Moon\\" has a nice reggae-influenced chorus.  I would only have thought Weird Al would've come up with a symphony of domestic disasters and harmless surprises that throw people off guard, but Sting too tackles the same in a wry but humorous manner.  In \\"On Any Other Day,\\" the chorus goes \\"My wife has burned the scrambled eggs/The dog just bit my leg/My teenage daughter ran away/My fine young son has turned out gay.\\"  Things go from totally silly, \\"Cut off my fingers in the/Door of my car/How could I do it?\\" to the more heartbreaking \\"My wife is proud to tell me/Of her love affairs/How could she do this to me?\\"<br />More of a reggae flavour here in a song of being deserted, where a bed is objectified as the connection in the former relationship.  Clever title, \\"The Bed's Too Big Without You,\\" better than any generic sort of \\"I Miss You\\" or \\"Can't Live Without You\\" titles.  The angst of the main character is told in lines such as \\"I can't sleep with your memory\\" or \\"I get thru day but late at night/Made love to my pillow but it didn't feel right.\\"<br />\\"Have we got contact\\" asks Sting in the uptempo \\"Contact\\"?  Getting a note from a certain someone on the possibility of some intimate contact leads to a line, \\"I'd come on over but I haven't got a raincoat,\\" which could mean being without a mac in the pouring rain, or someone prophylatically-challenged.<br />The overwhelming insecurities one is inundated with on a date is aptly covered in \\"Does Everyone Stare.\\"  The concept that it's image and presentation that matter, the worry of not messing up and looking a right 'nana, and trying not to be awkward, something dealt with humorously:  \\"I never noticed the size of my feet/Until I kicked you in the shins/Will you ever forgive me\\"  And I'd probably be one of those who'd let the phone ring twice and then decide, \\"Not home.\\"<br />The dizzying tempo of \\"No Time This Time\\" is a reflection of the mad rat-race of the post-industrial world, and yes, I agree with the refrain:  \\"If I could/I'd slow the whole world down/I'd bring it to it's knees/I'd stop it spinning round.\\"  Come on people, let's slow down!<br />A good followup to Outlandos D'Amour, reflecting punk's dissatisfaction with the post-industrial world, with the usual clever and sophisticated songwriting and wry observations on life.e dog just bit my leg/My teenage daughter ran away/My fine young son has turned out gay.\\"  Things go from totally silly, \\"Cut off my fingers in the/Door of my car/How could I do it?\\" to the more heartbreaking \\"My wife is proud to tell me/Of her love affairs/How could she do this to me?\\"<br />More of a reggae flavour here in a song of being deserted, where a bed is objectified as the connection in the former relationship.

0800141601|5.0|Sean Connery is awesome as Arthur, Julia Ormond is beautiful and sensual as Guinevere, and Richard Gere sizzles as Lancelot.<br />It may not be the most historically accurate portrayal of Camelot and the circumstances surrounding it, but it's a great movie nonetheless.<br />If you're in the mood for a great romance with some adventure and betrayal thrown in, I definitely recommend &quot;First Knight.&quot;
B00005YIPM|1.0|If you have this on CD, do NOT buy the SACD -- there is no advantage to the new mix, and no quality improvement.  Maybe the masters were in bad shape -- but given the stunning quality work done on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon (a 30 year old recording) and the sweet sounds of the Billy Joel releases, you've got to think that this one was just a &quot;slam it onto SACD&quot; job, with no attention paid to remastering or cleaning up or even optimally extracting the sound from the masters.  Don't buy it.
B00005S6K8|5.0|Julia Ormond is so beautiful and so perfect for this role.  She is sweet without being annoyingly so.  Harrison Ford is awesome as the uptight Linus Larrabee.  Greg Kinnear is perfect as the good-natured, but unable to commit David.  Nancy Marchand is funny in her role as the matriach of the Larrabee family.  This whole cast just blends perfectly to make a funny, touching film.<br />I much prefer this one to the original.  It's sassier, smarter, and just more fun.  I highly recommend this movie.
B00003CXMG|5.0|\\"Almost Famous\\" takes place in the early seventies and is a depiction of William Miller's experiences on the rock n' roll rollercoaster.    William has just scored a job with Rolling Stone magazine which leads him on the road with rock band Stillwater.   They go from town to town accompanied by their groupie band-aids such as the loveable but naive Penny Lane.  Penny Lane is crazy in love with Stillwater guitarrist Russell but Russell is only in it for the thrill.  William goes thru heck trying to get his story from Stillwater due to their reluctance to open their soul to a Rolling Stone writer who they call \\"The Enemy\\".  William is assisted  in his times of frustration by his mentor and co \\"uncool\\" writer Lester Bangs played lovingly by Phillip Hoffman.  Lester believes that rock n' roll is on its last legs in 1972..  If only Lester could see how pathetic rock n' roll is today...    Anyway, William turns out to be one of the few real and \\"cool\\" people in the end because he sees how denial can lead to heartbreak and he's the only one there to save Penny Lane from her demise.  I tell you that this movie is one heck of a ride with a soundtrack that will have you singing your heart out especially when \\"Tiny Dancer\\" comes blasting out on the tour bus!  The entire cast brings to life their characters with inspiring memorable abandon especially William's unconventional but loveable mom played winningly by Frances Mcdormand and director Cameron Crowe creates an authentic 1970's rock n' roll atmosphere coated with nostalgia and sensitivity that results in a most compelling and touching film experience.      My life was saved by rock n' roll and if you love rock n' roll then \\"Almost Famous\\" will steal your heart.

0618135871|3.0|I read Philip Roth's first few books then missed a couple of decades. Upon joining an online discussion group I read this book and find he has become just another old goat looking for young poon. Is he vying for that rascal Henry Miller`s mantle as Dirty Old Man of American Letters? I know that art can be about anything but an essay on the changes in society over the last forty years would have sufficed. Like many Woody Allen fans I prefer the older, funnier work.<br />Roth is a fine writer and unlike some best selling authors he does have a lot to say. I just could not get past the story of a twenty year old entering into a liaison with a senior citizen. As young coeds in the sixties, my friends and I would never entertain such thoughts about even the youngest instructors. \\"He must be at least thirty and probably married.\\" We had plenty of callow frat boys buzzing around who didn't know anything about anything and it suited us just fine.<br />Attending college in Canada, the Vietnam War did not really affect us except for the occasional kid with a Yank accent panhandling on the street. Draft dodgers. We kept our distance because American boys had a reputation for being fast..... By the seventies I was safely married sat on the sidelines during the devolution of the freedom movement into the disco era. That generation jettisoned the ideology and kept the drugs. A writer of Roth's stature would have no end of groupies willing to sit at his feet or do anything else he wanted. It was amusing when he invoked the US Constitution to bolster his case for doing exactly as he pleased. Rogering as an Inalienable Right.<br />His alter ego in the book is not an altogether hopeless case. Anyone as erudite and cultured as David Kepesh cannot be all bad. I found it endearing that he persisted with his piano playing even though he kept hitting wrong notes. He was truly attached to his friend George and went out of his way to make his last days meaningful even though it was an exercise in futility. We are all wary of being smothered by the very people from whom we seek comfort. Intimacy is fraught with danger. But being alone has pitfalls as well as pleasures.<br />Having a peek beneath David's detached exterior it gives the reader hope that he will extend himself to the ailing Consuela. The affair that caused him to regress into adolescent jealousy and possessiveness may enable him to finally grow up. He only has to take the opportunity to redeem himself.ise in futility.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I was dreading seeing &quot;Lost in Translation&quot;. I'd heard a lot about it, and had somehow got the impression it was a very &quot;worthy&quot; movie, something you felt you ought to see. <br />To my huge surprise and delight I loved it. I wanted it to be longer. I wanted to spend a day with these people. It's true it's an idiosyncratic movie, and that's great for those of us who are sick of seeing the same movie in different clothes a thousand times. Or who are sick of movies only about special effects.<br />I missed Coppola's &quot;Virgin Suicides&quot; but after seeing this will certainly search it out. She has a wonderful fresh vision. And the strength of mind to put it on film.<br />In terms of character, although not of career, Bill Murray seems to be playing himself, a man who uses humor as a way to make the world more amenable. That's just what Charlotte - Scarlett Johansson - needs. Her husband is a star-struck dork and the outlook for their marriage isn't good.<br />Beautifully filmed, sensitively put together. With such a strong individual vision that you'll either love it or hate it. Not many come down in the middle.<br />And don't listen TOO much to the complaints about the previews on the DVD.  Granted, it's a bit annoying, but they DO superimpose a sign saying you can fast-forward through the previews. It took all of two seconds on my machine. <br />If you miss &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; you'll be the loser.
B00008OLYN|5.0|is a very conscious effort to incorporate the influences of both metal and the progressive bands of the late sixties and early seventies (such as King Crimson) into a powerful noise.  This is, to put it simply, a masterpiece.<br />While long time Opeth fans will see this as a departure (for better or worse) from the death metal that is their metier, for newcomers such as myself this is either a brilliant stand alone album that ought to have been the album of the year, or the doorway into Opeth's past catelogue.  In either case, Opeth is a force.<br />Buy this CD and the live DVD &quot;Lamentations&quot; and hear and see for yourself.
B00008EYA5|2.0|Collin Farrel and Samuel L Jackson are about the only thing that is interesting until the last 25 minutes of this uneven film.  Continuity problems abound and it is hard to suspend one belive in reality to be able to accept much of what you will see.  Special effects are actually OK, about 3 stars.  The main problem was that we kept finding ourselves checking the DVD status to see how long it was until the end of the movie.  <br />Finally with about 30 minutes left, it started to get real interesting.  <br />The movie became interesting enough to almost ignor its worst contnuity problem of all.  The SWAT guys in two cars THAT are Ttraveling almost bumper to bumper and then suddenly they are so far apart, that the helocopter can't even tell the lead car where the second car is.  I just let out an AAH for its stupidy.  <br />There is no nudity, no simulated sex and no grotesque spurting blood.  There is moderate swearing including the F word.  I can't recommend this movie to any one except huge Farrel fans, if he has any yet.  Except for a couple of vulgarities, it is ALMOST family friendly.  This movie had some potential, but lost it way.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|There's no question that bigger, bolder, better, faster applies to the X-Men sequel, with a whole array of new characters, more stunts, an obviously bigger budget and a returning cast.  This time round the X-Men must club together to defeat mutant-hating Synger (Cox), who is attempting to trick Professor X (Stewart) into destroying all the world's mutants using his telepathic powers.  Alongside Jackman's hulking Wolverine, there are some great new characters, most notably Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler.  A seemingly bizarre casting choice, he works surprisingly well as a German teleporting mutant paired up with Halle Berry's Storm.  Of the kids at the training academy, Iceman's powers are displayed with a light touch, along with his look-but-don't-touch relationship with Paquin's Rogue.  Pyro doesn't really get much screentime but, without giving away too much plot, there's a distinct feeling there'll be more of him in X-Men 3.<br />The acting, as a whole, is good.  In particular, James Marsden isn't nearly as irritating this time round, and actually gets a chance to act in the final scenes.  Famke Janssen proves that she can be quite a presence, and McKellen gives it his all.  But there's no doubt that this Jackman's movie, and he gives it his all to come across as the dark mysterious type.  This fits in seamlessly with the references to his murky past and the fact that his mean streak is shown in full this time round.<br />As for the film itself, it's edge-of-your-seat stuff, so the exposition-packed first installment really pays off.  The fight scenes are more impressive, particularly between Wolverine and his female equivalent, an energetic Kelly Hu.  There are also plenty of exciting stunts and the scene where the military break into the academy is very well staged indeed.  Even the obligatory 'human' element of the storyline is anything but cheesy, and mostly quite subtle.  Witness Storm and Nightcrawler, Rogue and Iceman and, in particular, Wolverine and Jean Grey.  Of course, all of this is nothing compared to the ending, which should ensure big box office openings when X-Men 3 is released.
B00005JM0B|3.0|He promised he'd be back, and he is in \\"Terminator 3-Rise of the Machines,\\" the third and probably final installment in the franchise that made Austrian weightlifter turned actor turned politician Arnold Schwarzenegger a household name. Why do I think this film is the last in the series? Because, primarily due to Arnie's abrupt reversal in his views about onscreen violence. \\"Terminator 3\\" isn't a great film. Before he had kids and decided to run for public office, Schwarzenegger had few problems blowing away hundreds of people in films like \\"The Terminator,\\" \\"Commando,\\" \\"The Running Man,\\" \\"Predator,\\" and several other 1980's actioners. What a difference a few years make. I knew Arnold had taken a turn for the worse when I witnessed the horrific \\"Junior,\\" but the disintegration had begun years before. Schwarzenegger's dogged pledge to minimal onscreen killing essentially doomed any \\"Terminator\\" sequels. Granted, number two worked well because it employed Linda Hamilton, had James Cameron at the helm, and worked wonders with special effects. Sadly, \\"Terminator 3\\" does not have Linda Hamilton, does not have James Cameron at the helm, and the special effects aren't as good as what we saw in the second film. What a pity.<br />John Connor (Nick Stahl in this outing) survived the events in the second film and is now a young adult with serious issues. Always fearful of any unexpected robotic deliveries from the future, he's dropped out of society in a big way. Connor doesn't have a phone number, avoids credit cards and other traceable technologies, and floats from menial job to menial job. His mother Sarah died of leukemia several years ago in Mexico, thus leaving her son to fend for himself in a world that he fears. John can never shake the feeling that he and his mother failed to prevent Judgment Day, and he is about to discover feelings have a way of becoming real. Sure enough, a termination unit appears on the scene. This time out, it's the new and improved T-X machine (played by sexy Kristanna Loken), a robot wrapped up in the guise of a female capable of controlling other machines and sprouting weapons from its body. Fortunately for John Connor, the humans in the future managed to send back another Arnie terminator to serve as a personal bodyguard. From here on out the movie is your typical chase and destroy vehicle, as Arnie and the T-X battle their way through various settings.<br />The plot makes a few digressions with the introduction of Kate Brewster (Claire Danes), an old childhood sweetheart of John Connor who just happens to meet up with her old flame when John robs the veterinary clinic where she works. Moreover, Brewster's Dad just happens to be the military guy in charge of Skynet and a new generation of robotic weaponry instantly familiar to fans of the first two films. See how it all comes together? Arnie ends up protecting Brewster and Connor from the deadly attentions of the T-X. When queried by Connor and Brewster about Judgment Day, Arnold explains that nuclear annihilation is inevitable, and that Sarah and her son only postponed the inevitable when they destroyed the T-1000 in the second film. Since the world is about to go into the wastebasket, it is Arnold's mission to get Brewster and Connor to a safe location before the bombs fall. Predictably, our heroes aren't about to accept the fate of the world lying down. They convince Arnie to escort them to the military base where Kate's father is about to put Skynet online. If they can get there in time, they might succeed in averting disaster. Meanwhile, the T-X stalks them with relentless, ruthless precision. The conclusion to the film displays lots of explosions, nicely done special effects (again, not as good as the second film), and a few mild twists and turns.<br />\\"Terminator 3\\" could have been a great film. I fervently hoped it would attain greatness. Alas, the movie achieves only a rating of merely good. Of course, the biggest problem is Arnie's inabilityto mow down people. Let's face it--we all loved Schwarzenegger's early films where he wreaked massive destruction on scores of heavily armed thugs. You won't get any of that here. What further hurts the film is the absence of Linda Hamilton. She always gave the series a solid foundation, and the film suffers without her. They could have at least given us a cameo from Michael Biehn or Robert Patrick to serve as a touchstone to the earlier movies. Nope. The only person we see from an earlier film is the guy who played the psychologist, and even then his appearance doesn't work as well as it could. Plenty of other problems abound, including plot holes like Arnold just showing up at the veterinary clinic out of the blue, (In the other two movies, Cameron showed us HOW the terminator tracked down John and Sarah Connor. Here, he just shows up.) and the over reliance on comedic elements throughout the film. What works? That chase scene with the crane was cool, and the fistfight between the T-X and Arnie is worth watching more than once.<br />Give \\"Terminator 3\\" a chance if you liked the first two. I've sort of knocked on the movie in this review, but I probably would watch it again if I had the chance. It's sad, though. The filmmakers could have made an ultra dark, nihilistic science fiction film instead of this comedic parody of what made the franchise such a winner from the start. I blame Arnold Schwarzenegger for the film's failures; it's obvious that in order to get him to do another film, the filmmakers had to give Arnie free rein to do what he wanted instead of giving the fans what they craved. Let's hope future installments--highly unlikely, regrettably--will return to the roots of the original.to mow down people.

0061015725|4.0|A very good story, one of Crichton's best and very thought-provoking. A potent threat -- an &quot;evolving&quot; cloud of nano-particles which act as an organism -- is actually made believable as the book rolls on. On the bad side, the first quarter to a third of the book goes VERY slowly and the protagonist is a whining, somewhat sanctimonious &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; -- basically, a loser. Things change when he gets into the action theatre and changes to a proactive, resourceful person. The ending is a bit far-fetched even with the good foundation in the middle of the book. But, it ought to make a terrific movie (duh!!)
0671015206|5.0|Make it The Millionaire Next Door. Fans of 1,000 page+ fluffy books written by magazine authors with no financial credentials will not like this book. Former Nixonites who take cheap shots at the rich and attack without basis or fact and write stupid books will not enjoy this book either. Nor will spendthrifts. The get rich quickies won't enjoy this book either.<br />If you are like me and are looking for a proven program that really works and has been explicitly researched, then this book is for you.<br />Tony Robbins talks about modeling. If youw ant to be rich, doesn't it make sense to model the rich? This book and The Millionaire Mind shows you how the rich think and how they become rich.<br />And unlike some other books, there is no fluff here. It does take discipline though and discipline is tough.<br />Also recommend Awaken The Giant by Tony Robbins and More Wealth Without Risk by Charles J. Givens.
B00008CLOA|4.0|This album is an essential addition to almost anyones music collection, however, I still have the origianl from about 30 years ago on LP (Harvest), where its called THE dark side of the moon, also, im no so keen on this 'remastering' I prefer it the way its supposed to be, played on LP, however since most people dont have turntables anymore, you'd better buy the CD. 5/5 for the album but as i said, i dont like it on cd.
B0000C8AQM|5.0|Stevie B loves Edge Of Seventeen by Stevie Nicks! And Nick was sure to include it on one of the many CDs he made him! He gives him such hell at work it's amazing Stevie B hasn't quit by now! Especially the &quot;Workin At The Riv&quot; CD! Oh Yeah brotha! If this CD had &quot;I'm So Excited&quot; and &quot;Macho Man&quot; Stevie B would buy it! Oh yeah, Stevie B looks just like Jack Black in this movie. Thats why I had to post this.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I love Gollum/Smegual<br />IF you watch the making of him, it's really a guy with a computer graphic over it. And he does the voice for it. It's absoultely amazing what he went through for the characeter. But I loved the war scene, it takes my breath away every time. I dont know if you remember this scene, but the part where the guy with the white beard, the evil one is talking to worm tounge about having enough warriors and when worm tounge came out and saw 10,000 fighters, he started to cry, and he's an evil guy, I thought that was great to put that in. Even he was amazed by the war.<br />AMAZING!!!!!!!!!
B000000993|5.0|This CD is way better than Aenima however it still lacks what Lateralus has. This CD is creative, and if you buy the old version with a black CD tray lift it up there is a hidden picture. The best song: Prison Sex.
0425098478|2.0|Kenneth Blanchard's &quot;The One Minute Manager&quot; is a short book that should have either been much shorter or much longer.  The longer version would have been supported with research and case studies to back up Blanchard's claims that the techniques are effective.  For readers who don't need or want the supporting evidence, here is what the shorter version would look like:<br />1)  Good managers are not micromanagers; they expect employees to take initiative and solve their own problems.<br />2)  Good managers set goals for their employees that are brief and have clear performance standards and expectations.<br />3)  Good managers look for opportunities to praise their employees because self-confident employees are happier and more productive.  Employees learn to internalize praise.<br />4)  Good managers are also quick and clear in providing feedback when something goes wrong.  Reprimands are more effective when it is understood that managers think highly of their employees.  (Presumably, if the &quot;One-Minute Reprimands&quot; happen too often, the employee will no longer work for the One-Minute Manager, so that ending reprimands with statements of the employee's value, as suggested, will always be sincere.)<br />That's about it.<br />All this is probably good advice. One of the bosses whose management style I most admired and who inspired me to a high level of performance was very much like the One Minute Manager in the book.  I rarely saw him, but when I did, it was clear that he had been paying attention and that he valued my work.<br />But the storytelling format of the book--it's told by a naive young narrator who interviews the one-minute manager and his employees--draws a couple of pages of material out into a hundred page book.  That's much less than many management self-help books, to be sure, and one gets the impression the author is trying to walk his talk.  To Blanchard, management is more common sense than rocket science, and a long book wouldbe a waste of time.<br />I like the idea that, in management as as in writing, less is often more.  In many workplaces, memos, meetings, and manuals are about ten times as long as they need to be.  We are bombarded with so much information that, what my bosses often want and what I appreciate most from my own employees, are good two-paragraph summaries of a week's worth of research.  If they are done well, these summaries will take longer to research and write than a ten page report would have, but they save their readers time and actually produce a net gain in information.<br />But if Blanchard's book wants to be the Strunk and White guide to the boardroom--brevity, brevity, brevity--the book falls short.  It took me almost an hour to read, which is 59 more than it should have.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Suprisingly this second CD lives up to the first CD. I really didn't think A Perfect Circle could live up to it, but they did. This CD is greatness, music at its most creative peak. The Best Songs: Gravity, The Outsider, Pet, Weak and Powerless, Blue.
B000002UJQ|5.0|People wonder where Radiohead concieved of there strange album names and song titles. Ive never heard anyone mention this but it is so blatently obvious that i had to put it out there. In the series &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot; by Douglas Adams there is an annoying computer that people always respond to sarcastically &quot;Ok Computer&quot; there is a character named Marvin the Paranoid Android and there is a homesick alien character and there are innumerable references to these books in Radioheads material. If you are a diehard Radiohead fan or just looking for an amazing quirky read of british humor check out Douglas Adams's &quot;The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy&quot;.
B00000099Y|5.0|Not as good as Lateralus. This CD has to many supposedly artistic interruptions. Like one track &quot;useful idiot&quot;, is just static and &quot;Dier von Satan&quot; is german recipe for cookies, and &quot;Ceasaro Something?&quot; this is just dumb,and I believe the song is IONS, this song has a baby crying loudly. This CD would be great minus these songs. I don't even know why they are on here. It kind of ruins the CD. Best Songs:Stinkfist, Aenima, Third Eye, 46 and 2, H.
B00005OCMR|1.0|This is an awful movie. I'm not saying the visuals aren't impressive, because they are, but the movie is awful. The plot is weak, and it took us like 20 minutes in to figure out what the heck was going on. Don't waste your time. Go see something else.
B00005B36H|5.0|This is the best Tool CD ever! This CD does not play around with stupid artistic tracks like static. This CD actually delivers the music. Trippy and highly creative. Every song on this CD is amazing, I am just lost for words!
B00018D3RI|5.0|The five disc set contains over 20 episodes with great picture quality.  Bonus material is pretty weak.  I wish Glaser and Soul would have provided audio commentary on a seperate audio track.  I guess I can't complain at a buck and a half an episode.<BR>The shows have stood the test of time and are just as entertaining as when first aired.  Great chemistry between the two main characters and scripts that contain humor, action and drama.  What else could you want in a show?
B00005JN1L|3.0|I went into Secret Window assuming that I already knew what the mystery of the movie would be. As the movie went on, I still felt like I already knew what the secret was going to be. Then, when the resolution of the movie was shown, I was correct. The solution of the movie was way too obvious. Sometimes I don't care about predictability in movies, if it's a resolution. I did not like the resolution of the movie. It put me down quite a bit.<br />I can't say that  I felt like the movie was a complete waste of my time though, because it wasn't. Everyone says that Johnny Depp is awesome in this movie, and I would have to agree. He is. He is very entertaining to watch in this movie. He has quite a bit of excellent one liners and mannerisms that I can say is worth part of the admission price alone.<br />Also, I was quite interested in what was going on in the movie until about the last 15-20 minutes of the movie. So, I gave the movie a 3 because it was okay. I can't say that I disliked it, becase I didn't. I just disliked the last 15 minutes of the movie.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|I think this CD is just okay.  It's not a bad CD but she's done a lot better on previous CD's.  I think her best work to date is the BRITNEY album.  That album is the bomb.  She's still the princess of pop and is rolling in the dough.
B000021YQV|5.0|Not surprisingly, Toxicity was my first SOAD album since I bought it because of the over-crazed Chop Suey. I listened to it after getting it and didn't think much of it, until a year or two later after I got \\"Steal this Album\\" and their first one. Since then, I have been an adamant System fanatic. Toxicity compares to it's counterparts in that it's more heavy and feral. The riffs, interlude/solo parts are alot more concentrated and powerful but that's one aspect that makes the album great.<br />Prison Song (9/10)- Amazing. I actually hated this song until relatively recently because it repeated the chorus too much. However I like the political message and the riffs are strong.<br />Needles (10/10) - This is possibly my favorite song on the album. Since I listen to death metal/power metal as well, I really love the heavy punch this song throws. The drums are unusually pronounced in this song, giving a more thrashing feeling, while Malakian's singing solo is the best aspect of this album.<br />Deer Dance (8/10) - Not one of my favorites but still a good song. The sequence singing (heh, Vivaldi would turn in his grave) is remarkable, and Malakian's support singing is great as well. Repeated chorus too much at the end tho.<br />Jet Pilot (7/10) - A relatively weird song as far as SOAD goes. Not sure if this song has an underlying message, so I apparently don't know it. Switches between light and heavy very quickly (not that it's bad). Pretty redundant as far as lyrics go.<br />X (7/10) - Nice intro, heavy and proclaimatory leading into the main flow of the song. Pretty short [song] and repetitive but it's still not bad.<br />Chop Suey! (10/10) - No, no, I didn't give this a 10 because it's the popular SOAD song. This truly is great and it deserved to be a single. It's a unique and welcome variation from all the dull singles floating around at the time. I loved this song so much at one point that I translated it into Latin!! Eh, anyways, Biblical reference, abundant screaming, and emotional choruses make this song truly great.<br />Bounce (10/10) - Probably the weirdest song on the album, and I LOVE IT FOR THAT. Generally I dislike reptition but it's so neccessary and instrumental in the effect of this song, which by the way is about an orgy. All there's left to say about this song is: JUMP!<br />Forest (7/10) - Not a bad song by any means, but a 'typical' SOAD song if such a thing exists. It's relatively mainstream and nothing startling or unique.<br />Atwa (8/10) - Slow, tranquil intro which suddenly bursts into succession of loud and soft switching for the rest of the song. Guitar solo is slow but I love it. <br />Science (10/10) - Although this compltely contradicts ideas expressed in Song #1 of the first album (Suite Pee), it's still one of the best damn songs on the album. Nice fast-paced bass backing with sporadic guitar harmonics and a catchy riff with an armenian (i'm assuming) chant interlude.<BR> <BR>Shimmy (7/10) Relatively weird but decent. Very repetitive.<br />Toxicity (10/10)My favorite intro of all time of any song by any band (assuming you count first 45 sec as intro). Versatile, powerful, meaningful, remorseful but fierce. Awesome.<br />Psycho (9/10) For some reasons drums stood out most on this song for me. Decent song with catchy lyrics.<br />Aerials (8/10) My least favorite SOAD single ever. I can't even explain why. Although Bass intro is pretty nice.<br />That's about it for me. Enjoy
B00005A1PR|5.0|India.Arie has a special place in my heart.  I've seen her live for both of her CDs. Her beautiful singing and guitar playing brought tears to my eyes. She is such a beautiful person (inside and out). There is not a single bad song on the album, and I would recommend it to almost anyone. India.Arie can be compared to other artists like Lauryn Hill but she stands out from her. I highly suggest buying this CD, and seeing her live. You will not be dissopointed either way.
B000001BZT|5.0|Classic Stevie. The Nam-era combat patch alone gives you something of the flavor of this powerful album.<br />Steve actually just missed being drafted (he was born in 1955) as they stopped shipping draftees in 1972. Under the Paris Peace accords, there were massive troop withdrawals, during which many of the Surgical and Evac. Hospitals also pulled out. By April, 1973 it was basically over.<br />Yet Steve's two-tour Vietnam Vet in Copperhead Road has many real-life counterparts. In many ways Copperhead Road is the ultimate rebel song, in which the grass-growing Vet indicates that the lessons he learned from Charlie (Victor Charlie = VC) make him one heck of a threat to the sissy DEA helicopters (just take out the tail rotors).<br />These combat veterans were never honored for their service, and for many reasons, they had an arrest rate of more than twice that of a comparable non Vet. You get the sense that this is Steve's 'what if' song, in that he could see himself being in the same position as the Vet who comes back 'with a brand new plan'.<br />Devil's Right Hand is without a doubt one of his best songs, and one of THE best songs you are ever going to hear. Yeah, very much a post-country album and one that gave the world two songs (the rest are good, too) which stand as true modern classics, and which assure the survival of Steve as an artist to be reckoned with, against all competition.<br />Worth it for the cover alone!
B00005B36H|4.0|This is my first Tool album, and I was mildly surprised at first.  If you know nothing of Tool, be advised it is probably not what you're expecting.  My first impression was that it shared a connection with Pink Floyd's The Wall.  It has that same everlasting oddness to it.  The thing that disappointed me the most was that the packaging sucks in my opinion.  Who wants to carry around a album inside a sleeve that constantly falls off.  The song titles are not printed on the actual case so it seems that I will be toting the sleeve with me as well.  The disk itself has no text at all.  There is a mix of very hardcore songs as well as some very mellow songs.  Lyrics are virtually non-existent, this album relies on instrumentals to give it flavor.  If you want some very hardcore rock I suggest you look at some other artists.<br />I give the album 4 stars because I imagine that Tool fans knew exactly what to expect and it's not easy for a newbie like myself to grasp it right away, if it weren't for the crappy packaging It would have gotten 5 stars.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|This movie could have been much better developed than it was I thought. One gets the feeling that it was OVERLY edited or at least I did...I found myself always waiting for Katherine Watson (Julia Roberts) to do something drastic to change things for women but it never happened..maybe the fact that she chose not to return to the school was how she chose to bring about change...I thought it was an accurate depiction of Wellseley College (Hillary Clinton's alma mater) back in the day...the actress who stands out the most in this film is Kirsten Dunst who I just adore...all in all, the movie is just ok.
0783240287|5.0|Wow! I really dont have regrets when i bought this film, it's truly fantastic. Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber has done it again like what they did from the 'modern' version of 'Jesus Christ Superstar' The film was filled with dazzling performances and colourful visuals especially their costumes and the set! Not to mention its hit music like the full swing groove of 'Go Go Go Joseph' wonderfully choreographed by the casts and comical song 'Jacob and Sons'. Casts led by Donny Osmond did a great job of performing 'live' in this film. Sound is spectacular and music was a hip!
B00006M183|5.0|The album has a darker sound, and at first seems to be missing hooks.  However after a couple of listens it really grows on you.  Fast and Slow, Personal and Political this album has it all.  If you liked Ten but not the recent albums you wont like this either, but if you like good rock and something that wont rot your brain give this album a try.  To me its their best yet.
0679428895|5.0|I love Ancient Rome, and I greatly enjoyed &quot;Pompeii&quot;.  It was a fun, light, lively, quick read.  Robert Harris manages to vividly recreate the era - the imagery of day-to-day life in 1st century Pompeii was outstanding.<br />I have to vehemently disagree with Anthony D'Amico's comment about the nudity and homosexuality.  There are hardly any occurrences of such scenes in the book, and what little that appears is indicative of the Roman attitudes and times.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This album is very good and it's dedicated to you, pop music fans. This is where Britney her real talents. This album is just like :<BR>Madonna's RAY OF LIGHT and Justin Timberlake's JUSTIFIED.<BR>All the songs are catchy. The producers are really BRILLIANT. :<BR>Bloodshy &amp; Avant (Mis-teeq), Guy Sigsworth (Madonna's What it Feels Like For A Girl), The Matrix (Avril Lavigne, Hillary Duff, Liz Phair), Red Zone (Sean Paul), Moby, R.Kelly, P.Diddy, Linda Perry (PINK, CHRISTINA AGUILERA), etc.<br />The songs :<BR>1. Me Against The Music. It's very great. At the first time you hear it, you may be surprised. But when you've listened it several times, this one will be your all time favorite song. Trust Me!<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom. This is going to be a hit everywhere.<BR>Really catchy. Make you move.<br />3. Showdown. My favorite one. Love the sound of the electric guitar (or whatever it is) before the chorus.<br />4. Breathe On Me. I feel like listening to Kylie Minogue.<br />5. Early mornin'. Good. Mid tempo song with good arrangement. <br />6. Toxic. Yeah! The #1 hit in UK and US. You'll be addicted  to it. Wonderful songs. Great vocals with bollywood sounds. It's just a perfect song to me. This is everyone's favorite. <br />7. Outrageous. Listen carefully, then you'll like it.<br />8. Touch of my Hand. Japanese strings, great music. Good vocals. Wonderful!<br />9. The Hook Up. You can't help moving your body.<br />10. Shadow. Just like Avril Lavigne.<br />11. Brave New Girl. This on e reminds me of the cool song &quot;Anticipating&quot;.<br />12. Eveeytime. Everyone's favorite too. One of the greatest Britney's ballad. Good vocals, good music. Makes us play it over and oevr again.<br />13. Me Against The Music (Rishi Rich's Desi Kulcha Remix). The #1 hit in teh Billboard dance track. I really love the Rishi Rich project's sound. Wonderful. Perfect.<br />Bonus track:<BR>14. The Answer. It's too bad that it's not available in The U.S. But don't worry, you'll hear it on The DVD (4/6). Really great. Brilliant.
B00006M183|5.0|Pearl Jam have gone down many avenues in their carrer but I think this record is playing on all thier strong points. I love the sound of this album. After their previous album Binaural and it's muffeled, over produced sound, this is more than welcome. This is their rawest sounding record. There is of course expiermentation but it never strays from the flow. It's still an album that you can just put on and after listening feel really fulfiled. Maybe my only criticism is that it is at times a little too formulatic but I think that the fromula they've devloped works and is the right direction for the bad.<br />Lyrically it walks the line from politics to the personal, which is a hard line to walk. I can understand why some may find the politics off putting but I don't find it to be too in your face. There are some very powerful personal songs, in fact some of Vedder's best lyrics in songs like &quot;Thumbing My Way,&quot; &quot;You Are&quot; and &quot;I Am Mine&quot; but at the same time contians some of the worst lyrics in any Pearl Jam album. &quot;Love Boat Captian&quot; contians some of the best and worst lines all in one song. Some of the lyrics appear rushed, which fits with the band's motivation to create raw sounding album. I can overlook some of the lyrcial misteps because I think their 2nd and 3rd take recording process helped give the band some of it't in studio energy back that they were in danger of loosing.<br />I think Riot Act is everything I love about rock and roll. I'm not going to defend them as still being good or use the word &quot;evolution.&quot; I think this record stands on it's own and the band needs no defendig. I will say that in the light of Pearl Jam-lite and new-grunge bands bastardizing a sound and style plays a large effect on the public's preception of the band and it will be interesting what people will say of Pearl Jam in 10 more years.
B000060MWU|5.0|a big film from the best director ever!!!
1582432678|4.0|I wouldn't recommend this book for everyone. The beginning is a bit slow, and perhaps not what would you might expect. Instead of a gruesome &quot;true crime&quot; novel, this book is largely about one woman's stuggle with motherhood. Eva is so terribly honest, that I found it really difficult to like her. I expected her to be a sympathetic character.  In fact, I found her self-centered and grating throughout most of her narrative. However, by the end of this account I had wept and cheered for Eva  This book was a definite journey, and in the end I found some understanding of Eva, Franklin, Celia and even Kevin.
B0001US8EO|5.0|This would have to be my favorite western movie, next to Tombstone.  Kevin Costner gives a superior performance as Wyatt Earp.  Unlike Tombstone, this movie starts with Wyatt in his teen years.  It goes through his whole life, showing what shaped him to be the man he was.  I would recommend that anyone see this truly great movie.
0140277447|1.0|There is a good reason that many Japanese are offended by this book.<br />Many pictures she shows are already proven to be fake or not related to Nanking. It's obvious that she never examined them closely or not examined at all. After all they are nothing but sick pictures that no one knows where it came from.<br />And there are countless nonsenses which I even feel lazy to point out.<br />I Think most Americans cant't differentiate freedom loving Japaneses who are grown up in a sophisticated society from stupid Chineses who don't know the concept of the freedom of speech, and their country is still one of the poorest country in the world (and its government constantly lies). But there is a distinct difference in those two.<br />You good Americans, please dont't let them advertise this kind of cr*p.

B0000VAFO0|2.0|Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney Jr. would be turning over in their respective graves if they could get a gander at \\"Underworld,\\" a tale about a war between vampires and werewolves that turns this potentially interesting conflict into one long, unending shootout.<br />Gone are the days when Count Dracula and Barnabas Collins defined for us the image of a vampire.  No longer are these \\"creatures of the night\\" the suave, well-dressed aristocrats who inexorably - often reluctantly - seduced unsuspecting bystanders into baring their necks to fulfill the need for human blood.  The vampires in \\"Underworld\\" can't be bothered with such mundane and hokey paraphernalia as coffins, crosses, or cloves of garlic - not even with turning into bats at the first hint of trouble.  These modern day vampires talk on cell phones, drive fancy sports cars, use personal computers and fight with all the high tech weaponry modern technology and a limitless studio budget can provide.  With all this fun gadgetry to choose from, what's the point in being a vampire anymore?  The result of this is that \\"Underworld\\" plays more like an over-the-top gangster action film that just happens to feature supernatural elements than a horror film rooted in centuries' old traditions.<br />The werewolves are even less interesting than the vampires in this film.  Not only are both camps indistinguishable from one another in looks and appearance, but the werewolves actually come across as surprisingly ludicrous and unconvincing in the few scenes in which they undergo their lycanthropic transformations.  Special effects have become so impressive in recent years that even they have a hard time exciting an audience anymore.  A case in point:  when oh when are action film directors going to jettison that most annoying of all action movie clich&eacute;s - gun battle scenes filmed in slow motion?  \\"Underworld\\" has them in spades and they quickly become tiresome and boring.

B00008BXJJ|4.0|This is the edition to get, with 23 songs and two cd's, not the normal edition with one CD.<br />AC/DC is in top form here, their sound is strong. I'd like to make a comment to reviewer Tara Street. This is not Phil Rudd's drumming here. THe drummer here is Chris Slade, who by the way can blow Phil Rudd out of the water, and that's one of the reasons the AC/DC sound here is so improved.<br />Anyway, it has a few flaws. It does not say where each of the songs was recorded.
B00009L1TA|4.0|I'm not going to explain the movie cause other people have.  I'm not a big Travalta fan and I don't know why.  Though his acting is average and there isn't a hole lot of heart pounding action in this movie I really liked the plot and story.  When I first saw the comercials for the movie I thought here's another military conspiracy flick that are all like the rest of them.  But trust me in the end your going to be saying, yeah he's right, this was a good movie.  GO WATCH IT!!!!!
B000007ODY|4.0|Herbert von Karajan made many dearly beloved recordings of some or all of Brahms symphonies several times in his lifetime. Two complete sets are worth noting more than the others though. The recordings heard on the set reviewed here, and the recordings made in the 1960s. The set reviewed here was made in the late 1970s. At that time, DG was in the habit of using very close microphone techniques. Someone there thought &quot;the more the merrier&quot; and placed microphones as close to the orchestra as possible. The result is a sound that is very dry, almost entirely lacking in accoustic reverb. I dread listening to these recordings. They seem one dimensional. There is no depth. For example, the listener cannot tell if the timpani is right in front of the conductor, or in the back of the orchestra. The 1960s recordings are entirely different matter. They sound warm, three dimensional, lifelike in comparison to the 1970s. The 1960s recordings are not completely available as a set, to my knowledge. You can get #2 and #3 together (Amazon asin # B000001GBU) , but that CD is s very early remastering done in the mid 1980s, and is marred by digital graininess. For a good example of the 1960s set though, get the recording of #1 that is coupled with the Schumann #1 in DGs more recent &quot;The Originals&quot; series (Amazon asin # B000001GQ5). If you love Karajan's Brahms, this is the pinnacle to aim for. If only DG would issue all of the early 1960s Brahms recordings Karajan made, we who love his interpretations would be in heaven.
B00018TI5E|5.0|When I first got this album I had mixed feelings about what it was going to be like. John's other solo albums were all good, but just didn't have the funky, upbeat, melodic Red Hot Chili Peppers vibe. Well I can't say that this album is very funky although, I WOULD say that when you listen to it, his striking melodies, and heartfelt lyrics will seriously move you. I know that this album moved me. The first time I heard, &quot;Song to Sing When I'm Lonely&quot; I just couldn't stop playing it. Other memorable songs on this album are: &quot;This Cold&quot;, &quot;Every Person&quot;, &quot;In Relif&quot; ,and &quot;Regret&quot;. These 18 tracks all give out immense sense of John's growth as an artist, and his major contributions to the peppers sound.
B000001GQY|5.0|These recordings, and the remastering in the current edition, come as close to perfection as one could possibly want. Gilels and Jochum are never excessive with music that can easily be over-interpreted. The readings are truly Brahmsian, never close to the Rachmaninov-like indulgences many take with this music, especially #2. I recall the Pollini recording of #2 with Abbado as a good example of how NOT to play Brahms. While you know you are listening to music from the Romantic era with Gilels and Jochum, you also know that you are not that far removed from the Classical era either. I have no desire for any other recordings of these works now that I have these.
B0000714B5|5.0|Wow...how can I even find words to talk about this film? From start to finish, I felt like I was in swept up in a meditative state--the captivating music of Tagore's poetry, the beautiful cinematography, and the quiet simplicity of the film.  I suddenly found myself on Siddhartha's same journey, the quest of who am I and what am I doing here? And in the end, I felt totally complete--with all the answers and none at the same time.  Some have said &quot;there is not enough&quot; in this film.  Not only do I disagree, but I think that's the whole point! In an age where we are bombarded by special effects and other distractions, what a delight to see something that is not &quot;trying&quot; to be something! It just &quot;is&quot;--and leaves it up to you to see the beauty, which is abundant for all the senses.  Again, it is an adaptation so of course not everything can be included, but I felt Rooks &quot;kept it simple&quot; in Buddhist style and I didn't miss a thing.  Everything I needed to see and hear was there.  Also thought the casting was perfect--Shashi Kapoor dead on as Siddhartha and I thought had great chemistry with Simi Garewal who plays Kamala.<br />A special note about the bonus features: Don't miss the interview with Conrad Rooks! That was almost as enjoyable as seeing the film itself--his synchronistic and humble tale of how the film overcame substantial obstacles to finally be made.  I don't think I've ever heard as much behind the scenes info on a film! You're on the edge of your seat to hear what happened next....<br />Truly amazing, a delight for the senses.  I can't even think of anything I DIDN'T like from this film--it did that much for me.  I felt totally at peace.  If you are spiritual at all and open to someone else's interpretation of the book, you will not be disappointed!<br />Enjoy!
B00003CX5P|1.0|Great movie for kids. As an adult, I am disgusted with the whole Star Wars franchise at this point. Between Episode I and this over digital produced kiddie flick, I won't even bother with Episode 3. I think what I miss most from the original series is Harrison Ford. A real actor. Not a computer generated Jar Jar Binks. Bring the kids! Any adult who finds this fodder &quot;great movie making&quot; probally loves &quot;The Muppet Movie(s)&quot; and &quot;The Goonies&quot; The ruining of a perfect trilogy.
B000000H4V|4.0|Let me begin by saying that this is the very first Sepultura CD I've bought.  It is both raw and brutal from the very beginning to the very end!  What I really like about the music is that Max (the lead singer) channels his rage at subjects like censorship, racism, prejudice, and corporate greed to name a few.  It may sound like the band is constantly exorcising its own demons, figuratively speaking.  In any case, this is speed/thrash metal at its best!  Heck, these guys are even heavier than Metallica IMHO!  I've also heard parts of Roots and all of Nation (w/new lead singer Derek Green).  I'm thinking of buying more of the band's music.  Very impressive!

0345442970|3.0|Well, the title isn't quite true. I have read a couple books--the novelization of the Phantom Menace and Attack of the CLones, and Return of the Jedi, and the first Jedi Apprentice novel ... but I've never really delved into the Star Wars books ... until now.<br />This book answers many questions posed in &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot;  I read somewhere that it ends two years before, but I don't see how this could be the case.  It seems to me that te book ends right before the events of TPM ... maybe three to six months before.<br />There are new characters in this book that I loved--a band of mercenaries who I would love to see in other books.  My biggest obstacle in giving this book a higher rating is that it was difficult for me to keep up with all the political ramifications of events happening in the story.  There are a *lot* of characters in this novel, and keeping them all straight was a chore at times ... particularly regarding all the different alien races.  Still, having said that, the book held my interest and made me want to reread the novelization of Phantom Menace, and other books in the SW saga.<br />One thing I'm confused about ... and I don't know if I've just missed something obvious or not ... there's a cahracter named Bail Antilees who is a senator, and we know Leia's father is Bail Organa who was also a senator.  It almost seems like these have to be te same person ... but how will/did/does the name-change occur?  It's very odd...<br />All told, this book is definitely a worthwhile read, particularly if you like Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi, and want a book that feels a lot like The Phantom Menace--sans everyone's favorite Gungan (sarcasm there, folks.).
6303431038|5.0|Have to say I thoroughly enjoyed Laurence Kasden's film, which goes further than any other in it's dramatisation of the life and times of Wyatt Earp.<BR>Kevin Costner, in the title role, is perfectly cast, aging from Earp's younger days into old age.  The performance is notable in it's gradual changing and mood from a care free, wild individual to a middle aged and hardened man - and ultimately into a serious, but thoughtful Wyatt Earp at the conclusion.  It must be said that Denis Quaid's incredible Doc Holiday outdoes all the rest.  The viewer has to look twice to recognise that it is indeed Denis Quaid playing the role.  The Actor had lost so much weight for the part, that he looks like the dying gunfighter and gambler one would expect, suffering from TB, in a portrayal which no other actor, including Victor Mature, Kirk Douglas and more recently Val Kilmer, can compete with.  His Southern accent is also flawless.  He also paints Holiday in a more caring light then before, less self centred, but no less capable of violence.<BR>The movie itself, with a running time of over three and a half hours, is a relatively factual chronicle of the life of the mythical Lawman, and of his complicated relationships with his brothers and their wives, and of the hardships that shaped and moulded him.  He comes across as a very deliberate person, but also very cold and ultimately inconsiderate, as well as being heroic and the paragon of justice.  One thinks of Burt Lancaster as Earp in &quot;Gunfight at the OK Corral&quot;, but it is rather Lancaster's role in Michael Winner's &quot;Lawman&quot;, that Costner evokes in his role.  The notion of &quot;when the legend becomes fact, print the legend&quot; from 'The Man Who shot Libery Valance', is also brought to mind at the conclusion with the re-telling of the Tommy O' Rourke legend. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent with Gene Hackman perfect as the Paternalistic mentor of the Earp familly. The whole conflict between the Clanton and McLowery clans is more clearly examined, although they don't dominate proceedings in the way that Walter Brennan  as Ike Clanton did in &quot;My Darling Clemintine&quot;  It's also nice to see Karen Grassle in a small part, along with Bill Pullman, Tim Sizemore and Jobeth Williams. Mare Winningham is also notable in her role as the tragic prostitute who assumes Earp's name in the vain hope that some day he would love her and marry her, and Issabella Rossalini plays Doc Holiday's Kate, tempestuous and attractive, but violent and hard. This edition is presented in it's full widescreen aspect, and is best viewed as such, taking in the wide prarie vistas, and detailed railroad scenes.  James Newton Howard contributes a memorable epic score.<BR>A must for all movie epics.
B00005JLRT|1.0|When it's not boring it's ridiculous. This film not only has no respect for the established facts of the Star Trek universe, it has no respect for the viewer!  It's as if the fools Bragga and Berman (the producers of this failed enterprise, pun intended) assume the viewer has never seen another movie, and will therefore actually be intrigued by this cliche', predictable, and pendantic plot.<BR>Don't waste your time.
B0000039QA|5.0|I find it amusing and sad that people come up with lame comments on biggies albums like dont buy it buy 2pac or 2pac was better why? its so sad and a disgrace to the memory of both slain rappers. You people will never understand hip hop music/ culture.
B000005RTG|4.0|Being old enough to remember when this album came out dates me to the 70's, but just as I like think I get better with age I surely know &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot; does. As much as I loved the original cast of Deep Purple this one-time line up achieves great things! The guitar work of Tommy Bolin is nothing short of spectacular. Coverdale's vocals also sparkle. Perhaps the best song is an anthem garage bands can relate to called &quot;Getting Tighter&quot;. &quot;Drifter&quot; and the ballad called &quot;This Time Around&quot; also shine.  While this record never got the air play it richly deserved Deep Purple fans and Tommy Bolin fans should add this unique offering to their collection...

B0000028UK|4.0|NOTE: I'm sure I've reviewed all of Pearl Jam's albums before, but in the wake of the upcoming \\"Ten\\" re-issue, I've decided to give them all a second look, especially since I think I'm a way better reviewer than I was a few years ago.  I will review the \\"Ten\\" reissue the day of!...       I'm going to risk the wrath of all Pearl Jam fans (trust me guys, I am one of you) by saying that, if I had to pick a weak early album by the group, \\"Vs.\\" would have to be it.  This is more because it sits right in between two of Pearl Jam's masterpieces (\\"Ten\\" and \\"Vitalogy\\") than it is due to any severe weaknesses the album has.  After all, this is the album that has three of Pearl Jam's best tracks ever recorded (\\"Daughter,\\" \\"Dissident,\\" \\"Elderly Woman Behind a Counter in a Small Town\\"), and STILL holds the record for best-selling week by an alternative rock group (a record that will likely never be broken now that album sales have dropped so steeply this decade).  However, that much conceded, this album is simply a very solid hard rock/alternative album that lacks both the youthful energy of \\"Ten\\" and the brilliant angsty experimentation of \\"Vitalogy.\\"  Especially to be noted are three tracks (\\"Glorified G,\\" \\"W.M.A.,\\" \\"Rats\\") that are dated enough that the group has virtually stopped playing them at live concerts (save at Seattle shows like \\"Live at the Gorge\\").       In spite of these small weaknesses, \\"Vs.\\" is still a pretty awesome effort.  \\"Go\\" is a pounding anthem still worth head-banging to.  \\"Animal\\" is silly, but also fun and catchy.  \\"Rearviewmirror\\" is such a beloved rocker amongst Pearl Jam's fanbase that it later became the title for their greatest hits collection.  \\"Leash\\" is a profane political anthem that took on a new resonance in the Bush II era (something the band acknowledged by reinstating it into their live shows).  The superb \\"Daughter\\" and \\"Small Town\\" began the group's love of acoustic ballads that would come to enrich so much of their later work.  And \\"Indifference\\" is an odd but not unwelcome change of pace that closes off \\"Vs.\\" on an unsettling note (hinting at Pearl Jam's immense interband problems to come, and perhaps by extension the inevitable collapse of the alternative movement).       Overall, \\"Vs.\\" is a solid effort by a great band, and ranks with \\"Ten\\" and \\"Pearl Jam\\" as one of their albums that's most accessible to listeners outside of their loyal fan base.  I can't quite call it a masterpiece because of its weaker tracks and lack of a powerful theme, but I can give it a hearty recommendation.
B000089RVX|5.0|this cd is awesome but if you think they sound good in a recording studio wait till you see amy lee and all her boys live in concert it will blow you away her voice is 10 times better live as i saw her at edgefest 03'
B000002KAT|5.0|Y'know, I could spend my limit of 1,000 words writing about each individual song on \\"Astral Weeks,\\" or writing about Morrison's voice or his beautiful, bizarre lyrics or the \\"love to love\\" scat on \\"Madame George\\" or Richard Davis' bass-work, or Warren Smith's vibes, and never come close to expressing how great they all are or how much I love them.<br />So here's my much more economic review: if you don't have this album, get it because you're going to like it.  It doesn't matter who you are or where you live, this record is a thing of goodness.  Get it.  Eventually -- maybe sooner, maybe later -- it'll blow you away. <br />Get this album and play it.  Play it on your back porch or in a dark room on headphones or while driving through the middle of nowhere or while coming home from work on the train or where ever.  It will change your life and it will make you happier than you were before.  What else could you want from music?
6305320802|5.0|I absoutly LOVE this movie! It is a classic musical that will never ever leave us. Shirley Jones is a beautiful Laurey Williams. I believe that is her best role. Gordon MacRae is a perfect Curly, Rod Steiger is the perfect Judd, Gloria Grahame is the perfect Ado Annie, Charlotte Greenwood is the perfect Aunt Eller, Gene Nelson is the perfect Will Parker.........everybody's perfect!!! See this movie as soon as possible, and you won't regret it at all!
B00006AW2J|4.0|... this would be it.  <br />Recently, a friend of mine asked me to tape the best Stones albums for him and, of course, the absolute essentials of the Stones albums are their Big Five: \\"Between the Buttons,\\" \\"Beggars,\\" \\"Let it Bleed,\\" \\"Sticky Fingers\\" and the piece de resistance: \\"Exile on Main Street.\\"<br />But in going through them all, I found myself paying more attention to \\"Beggars,\\" which I usually throw over in favor of its big city cousin, \\"Let it Bleed,\\" and which is arguably the one of the five I listen to the least.<br />What an incredibly strange album for the Stones to have releaed in 1968. Yes there's lots of typical Stonesian stuff here (\\"Sympathy,\\" \\"Stay Cat Blues,\\" \\"Jig-Saw Puzzle\\") but clearly, \\"Satanic Majesties\\" purged them of their urge to be trendily psychedelic because this is an album full of acoustic and steel guitars, stocked with jugs of Jagger's acre-broad drawl. And, yes, it wasn't unusual to see an electric band head into acoustic territory in the late 60s but still... the year after the summer of love, what did people make of fashion plates like the Stones recording material along the lines of \\"Dear Doctor\\" and \\"Prodigal Son\\" ? <br />Founding member Brian Jones may have been in a holding pattern over Heathrow at the time, but fortunately other ingredients coagulated: Jimmy Miller's chunky production, the session playing of Nicky Hopkins and Ry Cooder, and influences on Keith Richards, who was clearly listening to lots of diverse blues and R&B records at the time.<br />Strange, beautiful record.  I've started listening to it in my shower-stall CD player in the mornings and it sounds just like a cold beer with breakfast after a late night.
B00004TH6O|4.0|I prefer Kyuss to Queens Of The Stone Age. They are heavier, have killer riffs, and had one of the best singers ever, John Garcia. This album, though, is just a plain good hard rock album. There are some experimental songs however, but for the most part, it's rocking. Feel Good Hit Of The Summer has the simplest riff known to man, and The Lost Art Of Keeping A Secret is a good drug-induced rocker. Leg Of Lamb is a weird one, but it manages to be catchy. Auto Pilot could be the pop single if not for the lead guitar breaks. Better Living Through Chemistry is the one that sticks out against the rest. Pschyadelic stoner rock is the best way to describe it. It starts out with tribal drums, then an interesting riff played by Josh Homme, then it completly stops for a completely different riff. Quite interesting. Monsters In The Parasol is a quirky rocker about..I don't know what it's about. Quick And To The Pointless has the almighty Nick Oliveri screaming his lungs out to a paranoid punk song. In The Fade reminds me of Screaming Trees. Probably because Mark Lanegan is singing on it. There's another Oliveri scream-punk song before the calmest song on the album, Mountain Song, kicks in. Then there is the absoulte weirdest song on the Cd, I Think I Lost My Headache. A cross between Monster Magnet, Fu Manchu, and John Coltrane. Seriously. A good album, not up to par with Kyuss, but still quite interesting.
B000002VEP|3.0|I first heard &quot;Closer To Heaven&quot; in an episode of the all-time great &quot;Miami Vice&quot; television series and was captured by not only how it was used in the show but by the greatness of the crafted song itself, beautifully delivered in smooth,soft fashion with Eric Woolfson singing. This great song turned me on to &quot;Gaudi&quot;, an album inspired by the life and works of Catalan Architect, Antonio Gaudi. Though not one of Alan Parsons most consistent works in respects to his concept &quot;formula&quot;, the 7-track album does contain some of his best work. The 8:44 &quot;Ode&quot; to Antonio Gaudi, &quot;La Sagrada Familia&quot;, is spiritually powerful. &quot;Too Late&quot; and &quot;Standing On Higher Ground&quot; is typical Parsons formula craft with catchy, pop melodies with meaningful messages in the lyrics. Besides the great &quot;Closer To Heaven&quot;, the emotional, heartfelt ballad &quot;Inside Looking Out&quot; is a Parsons classic as well. Only the irritating &quot;Money Talks&quot; is a throw away. Overall, &quot;Gaudi&quot; on CD is worth the purchase.
B00006879E|5.0|and I do mean every song.  I haven't fallen for a band like this in years - I've been pretty uninspired by mainstream music.  This CD, however, has completely blown me away.  Every track is incredible, with a funky, sexy, racy feel to the entire album.  Echoing what other reviewers have said, their style is hard to pin down, but the closest thing I can compare to is Jamiroquai - Maroon 5 wins that one hands down.  Buy the CD and play it through a few times.  The unusual sound may throw you off at first, but you'll come to love it and put it on heavy rotation!
0385504209|2.0|This author loves number riddles and in this book he adroitly discovers the lowest common denominator. But what's more important, how many books Dan Brown sells or the legacy of great individuals? (He should be imprisoned for what he did to Bernini in Angels and Demons - but, heh, heh, not too many lawyers around representing 17th century sculptors) This is Spiderman in the Louvre, Batman gallavanting around Europe. The plot is intricate and the background semi-interesting, but the characters are flat and the dialogue laughable. And the author REALLY needs to fess up in his little &quot;Fact&quot; sections as to what's not real regarding important historical figures. Can anyone name an Oliver Stone movie since JFK?  Coming soon to a theater near you, America!

B00003CWTI|5.0|&quot;Magnolia&quot; is a movie with so many parts hanging on the same theme that a surprising number of things I like keep bringing me back to this DVD.  This week it was hearing the same version of the song &quot;One&quot; which has a chapter stop on the DVD near the beginning of the movie.  I originally heard the Three Dog Night hit early in 1969, before I thought that rock 'n' roll was capable of illustrating any pure concepts more fundamental than a mathematics in which one and two compete for the honor of being the loneliest number, an honor which must be trivial, if not trite.  The song &quot;One&quot; is the first song on the &quot;Magnolia&quot; soundtrack album, where there seems to be no reason for the song to start with a spoken phrase, &quot;O.K., Mr. Mix!&quot;  Not in the movie, or on the DVD, the phrase surprised me even more when I heard a cassette version with vocal lead by Aimee Mann and &quot;All instruments by Jon Brion&quot; that was included in &quot;For the Love of Harry:  Everybody Sings Nilsson,&quot; a benefit tape with 24 performances released in 1995.  You won't be able to find that collection now.  I'm sure my tape was a special clearance deal that was cheap enough to distribute all existing copies, but the surprising thing is that Paul Thomas Anderson was so impressed by this particular song, great as it sounds on the &quot;For the Love of Harry&quot; tape, that listening to the song might be used as a foundation for understanding the 1999 movie &quot;Magnolia.&quot;  Nilsson had some cute moments, and background voices near the end of &quot;One&quot; rhyme `divided' with `they finally decided' the one thing for certain brings down the curtain because nothing keeps them together.<br />The second song on the soundtrack album, &quot;Momentum,&quot; is also a chapter stop on the DVD, for a scene in which John C. Reilly is playing a cop who has to shout over the music to tell an addicted fan that if she keeps listening to music that loud, even her neighbors are going to go deaf.  In that case, I think &quot;Magnolia&quot; is forcing the audience to listen to Aimee Mann at high volume because people have not been paying enough attention to her.  &quot;Momentum&quot; was not a big hit song, so the message must be in the theme, and forcing an addled fan to confront the law in the middle of the song adds a bit of force to that message, but a movie as awesome as &quot;Magnolia&quot; goes so far to illustrate the point that the song ultimately doesn't have much impact in the total scheme, until enough time has gone by to allow a dissection of the elements of this experience.  Only a few characters in this movie are dying, but the idea that everyone else will be getting back to normal soon enough might give spectators the creeps.even her neighbors are going to go deaf.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Donnie Darko is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The film has a strong script and even stronger performances.  Jake Gyllenhaal, in the title role, gives a magnificant performance that makes you forget that he did &quot;bubble boy&quot;(and THATS saying something!)  The movie has its gentle moments, and its moments that grab you and never let go, but the entire experience itself is rivetting.<br />All of my friends who have seen the movie went right away to buy the movie for themselves- its that good.  The ending will keep you thinking for weeks, and it will take a couple of viewings to truely begin to comprehend it.  It ends up like &quot;American Beauty&quot; with time warps and wormholes.<br />Not only is the movie amazing, this DVD has great features.  There are multiple deleted scenes which are interesting to see, and the commentary with Jake Gyllenhaal and the director/writer Richard Kelly help shine light on some of the more obscure parts of the film.  Overall, I'd say that this movie is a must have DVD.
B0000AZT72|5.0|This movie is actually a bit old to me. I saw about 2yrs ago when the DVD was released in HK/Asia.<br />It's scheduled to be released in US theatres which I am strongly against since they will give it bad dubbing and a horrible soundtrack (Kung Fu fighting?).<br />DO NOT WATCH IT IN US THEATRES. JUST DON'T. PERIOD.<br />Foreign movies need to be kept in their original language and soundtrack. This changes EVERYTHING if you try to watch it in dubbed. Subtitles isn't even noticeable once you get used to it.<br />As for the movie, brilliant and hilarious.<BR>It's got the spaghetti western feel to it along with the old skool kung fu flick then throw in todays technology.<BR>People who hate wire work and unrealistic fighting effects will probably abhor it.<BR>The movie does start out a little slow but once the main part takes effect, you can't wait to see which poor soccer team they play next.<br />The goalie scenes are the best.<BR>They should've kept one of those outtakes.

The new house is a filthy, dusty, and dark place, which once dwelt a sick old man who has recently died. To Michael it is a demolition site or a rubbish dump. HIs parents forbid him to go anywhere in the house until it is cleaned up and safe, but Michael is curious and wants to explore. One day he steps into the dark and mysterious garage of the new house with a flashlight.  There are pieces of \\"blue bottles\\", rubbish, old chests of drawers, and broken washbasins. The wood and cloth on the seats of chairs are rotting away and bags of cement are lying all around. He explores throughout the garage flashing his flashlight all around. He finds a figure that looks like a man sitting on a chair that is beside a window. He is filthy with blue bottles in his hair and he's pale. Michael is frightened but curious so he speaks to the figure. The figure reveals his name as \\"Skellig\\". His voice is squeaky because he hasn't spoke for a few years and Michael finds out he has survived eating bugs and mice. Skellig seems to have Arteritis and has trouble moving. Across the street a girl named Mina lives there. She helps Michael to take care of Skellig. They aren't sure if Skellig is a man, bird, angel, or somthing beyond imagination. They take care of him and in return Skellig helps Michael's baby sister get better. When Skellig gets well he flys away into the sky without a single trace.<BR>   This book was great. It was a hand gripping novel which, i couldn't put down. One of my favorite quotes from this book is \\"27 and 53\\" from page 19. 27 and 53 is a combination of Skellig's favorite Chinese take-out that Michael usually got for him while taking care of Skellig. Another quote i liked from this book was \\"He sounded like he was loving it, or he was in pain, or both those things together\\" from page 29. This was when Michael gave Skellig 27 and 53, which was very descriptive.<BR>   I also like this book because it had alot of words that made the pictures form in my head, which made it look real when you imagined it. It was a cliff hanger not only in each chapter, but seemed like a cliff hanger in each of the paragraphs. The characters were interesting and had unique personalities of their own, like Mina. This book was \\"mysterious\\" and unpredictable like most books i have read. It had a happy ending and it showed that some problems got solved and some didn't.<BR>   My favorite part of this book was when Michael goes in to the garage and discovers that there is a \\"creature\\"that hasn't been out in years. It would frightening if that really happened to anyone but the fact that Michael discovered Skellig is what the story is all about. Skellig is mysterious and a character that made a mistake long before, that Michael and Mina help him solve. The descriptions that the author, David Almond brings Skellig into life that you can really see even though this book contained no pictures. Skellig is a great book and David Almond is a brilliant author. I truly enjoyed this book.

B0001611DI|5.0|Finally this horror masterpiece is released on dvd. Truly a gem in the zombie movie genre. George Romero's 2nd installment comes as close to perfection as any horror movie can be. The dvd is incredible, the movie is as clear as it has ever been. If you know anything about real horror then, Dawn of the Dead and the rest of the Dead trilogy should definitely be considered.  Anybody who gives this movie one star is not a fan of horror movies and should not be taken seriously. This movie is not something that everybody will like, but fans of horror will surely enjoy this epic masterpiece.
0312263120|2.0|With errors an eagle-eyed editor should have caught (like a silencer on a revolver or a man described as vulnerable due to the noise his scooter made although his pursuer was deaf), plus descriptions of practices in the tech world at which techies (like me) can only groan (the last time I've dimmed a monitor, it said VT-220 on it; I power off my monitor to my pc or let the screen saver do the work for me.)  Still, a good story.  All in all, a 'beach' book that will keep you entertained but not too engaged.
B000002H6C|5.0|If you enjoy listening to metal, then by all means buy And Justice For All.  Metal doesn't get any better than this. Easily five stars. Also buy anything else Metallica released in the 80's. Don't listen to idiots who rate this cd one star, this album is truly a metal classic.
0385504209|4.0|In his breakthrough novel, Dan Brown re-introduces the reader to Robert Langdon, an expert from Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Brown stays true to form in this gripping read - you won't want to put this book down!  &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is full of rapid-fire surprises that are likely to leave one breathless, as the crew risks their lives in search of the Holy Grail. Brown's remarkably surrealistic work of fiction is literally teeming with fascinating anecdotes - which leave the reader shocked, stunned, and enthralled.<br />[...]
B000002H33|5.0|This reviewer from Ohio doesn't know what he's talking about. Don't listen to any fools who review this truly incredible masterpiece with one star.  Master of Puppets is one of the greatest Metal albums to have ever been released.  Anything Metallica released in the 80's is as close to perfection as metal can be. Also look into Iron Maiden or Megadeth.
0312119038|5.0|Karen Armstrong's Through A Narrow Gate takes you on a journey through her 7 years in a very strict order. It details her struggles and desires to &quot;die before you live&quot;. You get to learn all about what nuns in her order actually did and the experiences they would have. A very good book.
B000002UAU|5.0|Is there antthing left to say about this album that hasn't been said already? Probably not. \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" is pretty much the greatest album ever released. From \\"A Day In The Life\\" to \\"With A Little Help From My Friends\\" to the \\"Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite\\", just about every song on this album qualifies as a classic, from the simplest pop songs (\\"Lovely Rita\\") to the weirdest numbers (George's eastern -flavored \\"Within You Without You\\"). And before I go, let me give Mr. Banned (formerly known as Cranky Reviewer, Banned And Censored and Duran Duran's Number 1 Fan):<br />You say that \\"Sg. Pepper's...\\" was a major flop. Let me give you a little history about this so - called flop. \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\" spent 15 weeks atop the Billboard Top 200 Albums chart and spent over 30 weeks in the top 5. It has been caled the greatest album of all time by the greatest rock historians and musicians of all time. My point is this: Any person like you who denounces great bands like The Beatles, The Who, The Rolling Stones, The Supremes, The Beach Boys, Elvis Presley, Led Zeppilin and Bob Dylan in favor of the bland Duran Duran and Justin Timberlake should be strapped down and fed regular servings of \\"Sgt. Pepper's...\\", \\"Let It Bleed\\", \\"The Supremes - A - Go Go\\", \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", \\"Pet Sounds\\", \\"Sunflower\\", \\"Sticky Fingers\\", \\"Elvis: Second To None\\" and \\"Diana Ross And The Supremes: The # 1's\\", to name a few.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Reading all these harsh reviews, I found that this film is a mirror for people and their ignorance, or intelligence.<br />a) How is this a movie without a plot??  Thats just INSANE! Two people are separated from normal life.  Two people are cloistered and alone, even in their relationships with spouses.  The two people slowly meet, again and again.  Two people begin to share their lonely lives together.  Two people grow fond.  two people love, but don't take advantage. Two people seperate, having shared humor, love, regret, lonliness, Tokyo without having fully communicating their love.  They meet one last time and open up to each other.  Thats not a PLOT??  <br />b) This film seems to give everyone some dumb view point to bash someone in their lives, basically displaying they, the reviewers, are petty, gross, evil people at heart.  How is this a movie that gives rise to the ability to bash artsy people, Americans, Japanese, President Bush or anyone?  Are you people insane??  The people who like this movie LIKED it, it wasn't a LIFESTYLE choice.  It was something that appealed.  As for the German guy bashing Americans, thats just rude and dumb.  I come from German parents and I understand how sick some German thinking is, but good lord, keep it to your own ignorant self.  This is a film that could be about anyone anywhere.<br />c) Rascist?  How is this film rascist?  RACIAL maybe....but more culturally skewed and playful then RASCIST.  Are the Japanese even a race?  Whats is this about?  They had fun with cultural differences.  I didn't see 'wing wong, slanty eyes!' jokes, or even worse 'Me Japranese! Me brohm Peraw Hawboaawwww'....come on tendloins, get a life.<br />d) Not funny?  Sure, this film isn't what you call a pure American cinema COMEDY, but there is so much light humor going on with the characters and situations that it does have a lot of humor within this well rounded film.  It is a drama, romance, comedy film, but its just a really good film.  People must go to this film expecting  'HEY! WATCH ME PULL A GOPHER OUTTA MY HOLE!', Bill Murray slamming his genitals in doors, Asian sex jokes, people pratfalling on asian pears, wild eyed goofy takes at the camera, silly outfits, and the obligatory nude scene with the 16 year old being discovered by his parents and hiding his manhood in a pie.  This just isn't that.  How can you even expect that seeing any of the previews??  People are so ignorant.  Look at the poster, look at the cover, look at the previews!  Where is this a 'genitals in pie' story??<br />e) 'Emperor's New Clothes'??  The only person standing out here is the reviewer, showing off as a brazen dunce.  While, I expect, people wanted missiles whizzing around, car chases with funny faces and one liners right out of Nickelodeon cartoons, maybe some evil boss Murray and Johannsen must fight to prove their love, this just ISN'T that.  Some of my favorite movies of all time are 'Casablanca', 'Evil Dead 2', 'M' and 'Death Wish 3'...I can enjoy anything well done in any genre by anyone and I understand most people can't.  But to give this film 1 star???  What is wrong with you.  It is beautifully filmed, has some really excellent sequences, makes sense, has a plot, combines a lot of dramatic and humorous elements in writing.  People don't even rate some of the all time HORRIBLE movies that were filmed on 16 mm with total lack of story at 1 star..... <br />What this film really shows is how ridiculous 95 percent of the reviewers are.  Naturally, I am not one of them.
B000002N3J|4.0|I purchased this album at K - Mart on family trip Hershey, PA. It was supposed to be a collection of Madonna's best love songs. I knew just about every track on the album, with the exception of &quot;One More Chance&quot;, &quot;Something To Remember&quot; and &quot;I Want You&quot;, the latter a haunting reworking of a Marvin Gaye. I enjoyed every song n this album, but then I thought, are these really all the best?<br />Not that the songs are terrible. Songs like &quot;Crazy For You&quot;, &quot;Live To Tell&quot; and &quot;Take A Bow&quot; show Madonna at her softest. Many people don't know that besides looking hot, she's one hell of a singer. Still, for 14 tracks, they could've included a few more tracks. I would've loved to have seen &quot;Cherish&quot; included. I think it's Madonna's purest love song, a celebration of the power of true romance. Even faster numbers like &quot;Like A Prayer&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;True Blue&quot; and &quot;Open Your Heart&quot; are worthy of inclusion. I not saying this album has to include her biggest hits, but those previously mentioned songs easily fall into the love song category and are worthy of inclusion on this album. Anyone with a cd burner and the complete Madonna catalogue can do just as good, maybe better.<br />Overall, &quot;Something To Remember&quot; is not a bad collection. Every song here has emotion, ache and love conquering them. Still, it's not a complete collection of Madonna's best love songs by any means.
B000002UAU|5.0|that was a strange review, whoever you are. i assume your joking.<BR>anyway, after buying sgt. peppers today i hve been so affected by listening to it (as soon as it finished i put it back to track one), i decided to write a review.<BR>this the definetive example of the later beatles style - more white album then revolver or rubber soul. this record has a great sense of humour but still retains the great hooks, melodies and touching use of various instruments that the beatles always managed to produce. the string arrangement in &quot;she's leaving home&quot; is striking and beautiful, making it one of the superior tracks on the album (david!).<BR>you should feel it is your duty to own a copy of this album, even if your not a big beatles fan or have never heard them before (im 18 and have only discovered them recently), you need to hear this just for the quirks and innovations. chiefly the few seconds of 15 kilocycle tone at the end, added by lennon just to annoy your dog. <BR>genius.
B00006LETU|5.0|I bought the CD in 1983.  The quality of the recording was stunning, still is.  Somebody once said Duke Ellington is &quot;the quintessential American composer.&quot;  Crowning his body of work as the musical brains behind Steely Dan,  Donald Fagen's solo masterpiece The Nightfly shows that he may very well be the quintessential American composer of the late 20th century.       Musically and lyrically this CD fits the bill.  Jazz, rock, pop -it's lyrical, cerebral, romantic and it SWINGS.  Harmonically Fagen is happening.  Great hooks.  Music for the mind and body.  Scratch the surface and it's closest to our singular great American art form - jazz.  <br />It's as American as Thelonious Monk or Raymond Chandler.<br />Great music and lyrics in each song.  Fagen's first solo work takes a step back from the Steely Dan hipster cool - so what's so bad about a little romanticism?  Cool but warm.   And funny.<br />IGY - Spandex jackets, one for everyone ...<BR> <BR>Green Flower Street - Cmaj7  F#7  F6  E7.  Another cool move. He's got lots of em.<br />The reharmonization of Lieber and Stoller's Ruby Baby. Dissonance that sounds sweet.<br />The close, lush harmonies in Maxine - picture DF singing along with the Four Freshmen in the Jersey suburbs.<br />Tuesday Weld, bombs shelters, Brubeck, provisions and lots of beer. <BR> <BR>You'd never believe it, but once there was a time<BR>When love was in my life ... the last chord F#/A - DF listens to Joe Zawinul and Weather Report!  That was the future.<br />The Goodbye Look - bossa nova.  Marimba intro.  Great chords.  There's been talk, and lately, a bit of action after dark ... Tonight, they're arranging a small reception just for me.  Behind the big casino by the sea.  Dig the conga line outtro.<br />Walk Between Raindrops.  Great music. Swings. Unabashedly romantic.  I can see Gene Kelly dancing and singing in the rain.  Hold the Cmaj9+11.  It vibrates.  Perfect.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Even if it is lame as some people are saying, I enjoy hearing it.  Something about it is very soothing.  And they still sound like lil' boys.  LOL  You will feel younger while you listen.

B000068FY1|5.0|This is one of the most amazing albums ever recorded.  One of those rare albums that you love to listen to ALL THE WAY THROUGH.  Hard to catogorize this music with flavors of southern rock, blues, folk, alt-country, roots rock, etc...  I listen to this album a lot and it really continues to age like a fine wine.  Pure musical genius!  It's a real travesty that this band did not obtain major commercial success, especially with all the trash on the radio these days.
B000001IPP|5.0|From downloading &quot;Nihlism&quot;, &amp; &quot;Salvation&quot;, I bought this CD. LOVE IT!!! This is my 1st Rancid CD, but it certainly won't be my last. My favorite song is &quot;Nihlism&quot;. I think that's worth the $12 that I paid for it. Only 2:00, but still freakin' awesome. But the CD's still awesome. Buy it. Now! What are ya waiting for? Christmas? Easter? Your birthday? Get it now!
B000002H2H|5.0|There was a day when i was going through my friend's cd collection and i laughed at many a cds.  Peace Sells, Appetite for Destruction, Blizzard of Oz and over 50 more.  I laughed at all of them, but Ride the Lightning seemed to catch my attention. I dont know why, but I decided to steal this out of my friends collection and listen to it.  I heard the title track first and laughed, I absolutely hated it, but something kept making me play the song again and again and again.  And before i knew it, i loved the song.<br />Some people would not categorize this as thrash metal, but the lyrics and instruments show enough to say it is.  the death theme of the album, the singer's growl and the heaviness of the drums are all enough to prove this is indeed thrash.  I find this album to be better than Master of Puppets because this is Metallica's last album with songs that do not drag or repeat so many times.  think about Battery's repetition of the word \\"Battery\\" and the dragging at the end.  Then think about the dragging of almost every song on Justice, but dont get me wrong, both of those albums are great works from this band.<br />Fight Fire with Fire- an excellent opening to this album with a soft acoustic (or is it a keyboard?) introduction then plunges into a heavy guitar with anti war lyrics and a great solo.  A<br />Ride the Lightning-  this is a strange song mainly because it is so good, but metallica does not seem to like it very much.  first, i saw only 1 instance where they performed this live: 2003 in france on some new EP that they released.  plus, this is not on the Live Sh*t box set, and it belongs on there.  This is probably one of metallica's top 5 songs with an awesome riff and an almost 3 minute guitar medley.  A+<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls-  a great bass solo in the beginning and long introduction. shows that you can still be heavy at a slow tempo.  A-<br />Fade to Black- metal's first ballad.  again, one of metallica's top 5 songs with an awesome guitarat the end.  Also heavy at a slow tempo, deals with suicide and created much controversy in the 80s about people killing themselves with this song playing or the lyrics written on a paper close by.  defeats Sanitaruim on master of puppets.  A+<br />Trapped Under Ice-  i wonder what this song talks about!  [/sarcasm] After 2 songs of slow tempo, this is back to being fast and heavy, and the guitar shows the style of Kirk Hammett with the sort of \\"country\\" sounding guitar.  that style is extremely evident in \\"enter sandman\\"'s solo if u dont know what im talking about.  A pure thrasher.  A<br />Escape- Nothing much here other than a good melody.  solo kinda begins the same way as in The Call of Ktulu, but then changes. B+<br />Creeping Death- great introduction and melody.  it takes 2-3 listens to find out what the song is about (ill leave that up to you) heavy at a moderate tempo.  A<br />The Call of Ktulu- Orion's competition.  I find this one to be a lot more aggressive and orion to be a bit calmer.  The solo is awesome in this one (starting at 3:33).  funny, on the booklet, it says that a familiar \\"D. Mustaine\\" had to do with this song.  Somehow, when i first heard this song, it seemed familiar, but I dont know from where.  A+<br />metallica showed the world what they were made of with this album and laid a base for thrash/death metal
B0001CNRSE|2.0|This is a marginal movie that tries to exploit albas obvious appeal. Its not memorable except as an on screen launching pad for ms albas career. It is not fair to judge an actress only for first performances that can bring attention to her overall potential. I know she is very talented.I realize that sometimes these movies are inevitable.However she has already proven herself in dark angel.I will wager that her next moves will be to try a variety of concepts leading to big screen success.In the end i do not blame her for a foolishly made production by hollywood copycats.She is super. The movie?- is your decision. now you know mine.thank you !!
B00003E43J|5.0|I own this CD and love it, however the CD you offer for sale is 6 songs short of the original version??? How come? The origianl CD has 18 Songs on it not 12??? None of the 6 Songs that are missing is a \\"ALternative take\\" all 18 Songs have different names. Just thought I bring this fact to your attantion, maybe who ever copied it couldn't get the original one that has all 18 Songs on it??? To bad to sell a CD that doesn't have everything on it that it suppose to have.

B00004R99F|5.0|OH god this movie is great.  I saw it for the first time when I was probably 8 or 9 and I used to hate Goofy.  I saw the movie and I absolutely fell in love with it.  I just bought the DVD a couple of days ago and still love it.  It is definatly one of my favorite Disney movies--I can't go throught watching it once without cracking up hysterically every time.  It's the movie I remember making me remember who Pauley Shore was and the first time I'd ever seen Bigfoot disco to the Bee Gees.  It's definatly a classic.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Much like the above title subject... this is, truly, where you separate the TRUE Linkin Park fans away from the posers/player hatin'/rap crap b*s* listening/korn sucks!!! no matter what they says, indenial fans.<br />I mean, Are you out of your mind!! Just how many bands do you know that whenever they come out with an album (minus Reanimation), almost every songs in their album can be a hit?!<BR> <BR>Exactly!<br />Not even Disturbed (my fave band of all time by the way, just above LP) or Metallica has succeeded in that respectable category.<br />So Stop frontin' GO BUY THE CD!!! IGNORE all the haters, cuz chances are... they don't know what they're talking about.<br />'nuff said.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I caught only one episode of this show when it aired and didn't bother with it again (frankly, the prostitute character was what turned me off the first time around). Desperate for a scifi show, I thought I'd give it another chance and bought the series DVDs. What I got was a little bit of good (great writing and characters), the bad (the western riff is really tired. Hasn't anyone figured that out yet?), and the offensively ugly (the prostitute who spends time with both the guys and the gals-- yuck). To put this bluntly, there are precious few scifi shows out there, and I can't get into this one because I can't watch it with my kids. You screwed up on this one people, which was a shame. If you had cleaned up the act a bit, you might have had a better, and longer running, show. Fox did the merciful thing when they shot this pony in the head.<br />****edited March 18****<br />Ok, I wrote the above after watching all the episodes and coming away from the experience very, very frustrated with what might have been. On the one hand, this is a brilliant show, and it would have been a wonderful adventure getting to know more about the people, and their secrets, as they were revealed over time. On the other hand, the times the show crossed the line from edgy to offensive and salacious were a serious distraction from its strengths. For instance, the strongest episode by far was \\"Ariel\\", where the crew stage a heist at a medical facility while simultaneously helping Simon get his sister inside for badly needed testing for her deteriorating condition. It was pure storytelling at its best, without the sleazy stuff. Then there was the terrifying, and quirky, \\"Objects in Space\\". I still think about that episode, days after seeing it. Again, no sleaze. The weaker episodes were those that tried to distract the audience by including more objectionable material, a practice that only serves to draw attention to the script's flaws (usually a cliche or just plain boring story). Eventually this gets old and predictable. And I'm not just singling Firefly out, because this is a problem with other shows too.  <br />This is what I'm trying to say: Mel Gibson proved that there is a huge audience who will pay big bucks for an intelligent, yet still controversial, film. If the producers of \\"Firefly\\" (more specifically, the upcoming movie \\"Serenity\\") want to give their project a chance to be successful, they should consider reducing the sleaze factor. I'm not saying scrub the show squeeky clean, but I am asking that it be toned down some so people like me will want to watch it. I'm sure there are _many_ more like me who would learn to love the show, and would be eager for a chance to explore more of the Firefly universe. If the producers will tone it down,  I believe there's a better chance that opportunity will be there for us all.

At the time the Australian government is separating 'half-caste' Aborigine children from their 'degenerate' Aborigine mothers. All three girls are the daughters of an Aborigine mother and a white father, and are living in the small town of Jigalong. <br />This forced separation is determined by the Australian Chief Protector of Aborigines, Mr Neville (Brannagh), who is compelled to save the children from their selves and exposed to the 'wonders and benefits' of white society and culture. The plan is to train these 'half-caste' children to be the domestic help for the white society, and to ultimately breed the Aborigine out of them. It is the 'Good And Christian Thing' to do.<br />Ripped from their mothers, grandmother and auntie, they are taken to More River, twelve hundred miles away, a psuedo-orphanage, although 'concentration camp' is a term that also fits. Days or hours before they are snatched, a local tells Molly about the 1500 mile fence erected by the Australian government. The fence splits the country in two, erected to keep rodent rabbits out of arable farming land, and you can almost see Molly filing away the information in her head.<br />After they arrive at More River, realising that they must forget their mother's language and culture, to take on a life of duty and responsibility like all 'good Christian' girls, Molly does a brave and desperate thing. She grabs her sister and cousin and takes off, heading into the general direction of Jigalong, sending the 'Chief Protector' and the 'law' into a frenzy of searching. <br />Molly's will and the authority with which she takes up her task, provides a steel and grit required to broach the wilderness alone and unprotected. Her indomitable spirit brings all that make us human into sharp focus. She will not consent to being held, or separated from her mother and family, and she will not give up. <br />That this story occurs against a political backdrop, allows us to juxtapose the aridity of the Australian landscape, with Molly's own journey. However, this is an internal journey for Molly, as much as an external one. Remembering and finding the rabbit proof fence, she finds it and follows it for hundreds and hundreds of miles; home is somewhere along the fence. For Molly, it is the only guide she has in the wilderness. <br />Exhorting her younger charges, she dodges and eludes the skilled Aborigine tracker, Moodoo, and the Australian law enforcement, with wit and tenacity for the two months of the trip. She loses her cousin Gracie to betrayal and capture in the process; but pushes on, often carrying Daisy and living off what little the land provided.<br />In &quot;Rabbit Proof Fence&quot;, we watch and find guts to face simple challenges, in the struggle of Molly, Daisy and Gracie to face almost insurmountable challenges. That a story of courage like this one, could and does do that, should not surprise; a well told, well made story is &lt;strong&gt;meant&lt;/strong&gt; to do that. That it is a true story, based on the book, &quot;Follow the Rabbit-Proof Fence&quot; by Doris Pilkington, Molly's daughter, strikes even closer to the heart. <br />Although it's a story told in few words, the three extraordinarily photogenic faces of the first-time actresses are haunting, long after the fade to black. Their portrayals are entirely believable and engaging. Brannagh, as the chillingly misguided Chief Protector, displays the arrogance of European colonial perceptions of superiority with skill. Gulpilil as Moodoo who although has not and will not stop seeking the girls, almost cheers whenever clever little Molly eludes him. Sampi's indefatigable Molly, never exhibits defeat only defiance and determination. All three girls are excellent, turning in performances untouched by guile or affectation. <br />Molly's mother, played byNingali Lawford, oozes the longing for her children with her constant watching along the line of the fence with no words, just her eyes. In a scene where she confronts the law enforcement officer who took her children away, the strength of a mother's anger is powerful and palpable, although again, no words are spoken in the scene.<br />Peter Gabriel's soundtrack, made from adapted traditional Aboriginal music, is so haunting, as to take on it's own character in the film. The cinematography captures the sprawling Australian wilderness without overwhelming the image of these three tiny girls, walking, walking, walking....<br />The film allows us a view of the subtle and overt cruelty that European colonisation and racism creates, and the dogged pursuance of questionable values. The Aborigines in the story are subhuman to the colonists; as such, there is no wrong doing in their inhumanity. In fact, Mr Neville so convinces himself and his supporters of this policy, that the abduction and 're-education' of 'half-caste' children went on until the 1970s.<br />The Australian government created what has been subsequently called, the &quot;Stolen Generations&quot; among the Aborigine population. The Aborigines still suffer the effects of the child stealing. Many of their children, lost to the white world, have never returned home.<br />The film is impressive in every way; touching chords within the soul, and taking us on that internal journey that humanity faces when the inhumanity of ourselves turns back on itself. It's important because it tells the story of the suffering of the Aborigines in Australia, and exposes the hidden genocide against them. The sadness of the tale, enrages the heart of the conscious against the ignorance and self absorption of European colonisers, and the callousness with which they treat other cultures and races. It also, for this writer at least, allows one to remember the similar suffering still going on today.<br />This story's strength is not in it's angry portrayal of injustice, but in the gritty determination of the girls not to become victims to the racist policies of invaders and usurpers. We find definitive resistance and ultimately the victory of the human heart.
1878424114|5.0|I went on a 3 day sabbatical a few years back, and wanted to get a book that I could read while in my solitude. I found this book on tape at a 1/2 price store and thought it would be perfect for my journey.<br />Well needless to say, I followed all of the steps and applied them to differnet aspects of my life...it was the most thought provoking book, and was needed so badly at that time in my life. I often listen to this book every few months. I recommend anyone to read this book and just seek the truth...
B000063CPL|4.0|After their last 2 live albums (A Real/Live dead one, and Live at Donnington) being completely dissapointing, Rock in Rio is where they totally redeemed them selves. With Bruce, and Adrian back again giving them their 3 guitar line up, and their great sound again. I recommend this cd, or Live After Death if anyone wants to hear them live.
B0001US8EO|5.0|I have always wondered why this movie was pounded on by critics.  Although I think that some things could have been done better with the characterization of the film's antagonists, this movie is a cinematic gem.  The epic scope of Wyatt's lifetime in the West is brought to its full realization with realistic clothing, set design, and stunning cinematography.  Costner gives an understated performance much in the vein of Henry Fonda.  His Wyatt is a cold and hardened individual especially after the death of his brother Morgan.  Most of the violence is presented in a very matter of fact kind of way.  Although there are plenty of romanticized aspects to this film, a large part of Wyatt Earp rings true.  I'm very glad to finally see a DVD release ten years after the theatrical release.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is without a doubt the best alternative rock album I've bought any many years.  In fact, I would say I haven't enjoyed an album this much since Nirvana's Unplugged in New York.  Every song is amazing.  The lyrics are incredible, the guitar work is amazing, and I just love it!!!  I saw a tribute album out already for Audioslave if that tells you anything.  They have one album and there is already a tribute album.  Now that's amazing.  Buy it!!!!
0790731452|5.0|or not.  This is one of the best Burton films ever, and even maybe is the best Burton movie.  It has alot of big stars in it like, Jack Nicholson, Peirce Brosnan, Glenn Close, Michael J. Fox, Danny DeVito, and Jack Black.  Althou, this film may be a little graphic, it is still a movie for the family.  I have one question, it says Danny DeVito has a big part in this movie, but he's only in it for about 10-15 min, and maybe even less.  People with big BIG parts are rare in this film, cause all the main charcters die, which I think is stupid.  At least let Jack or Peirce live.  Anyway, ok when it comes to features.  The trailer I thought was pretty good, and the picture was perfect with the odd flaw.  The sound was EXELLENT.  To me, nothing seemed wrong with the sound.  On the disk of this, it says it is rated R, but on the back, it says PG-13.  I must say I disagree with both of those.  I think it should be rated PG.  One of my favortite parts in this film is when the aliens come to earth for the first time.  The ending is hilarious...You'll have to watch and find out.  So, this is a great and hilarious film and is one of Burtons best.  I highly recommend you ordering or picking up your copy of Mars Attacks, right this instant.<BR>9/10<BR>Rated PG-13 for sci-fi fantasy, violence and brief sexuality.
B00005JMEW|2.0|Kill Bill v1 resembled an old poorly-dubbed chinese kung fu movie far too much - the action sequences and sountrack were that hilarious.  In addition, the animation sequences looked completely out of place.  If q.t. was looking to reproduce the \\"freshness\\" of pulp fiction style-wise, imho he failed miserably.  The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I saw it on a nice new plasma screen at the Sun Valley Inn, after a decent meal.

This is one of the most relaxing cd's i have bought. <BR>The talent this individual puts forth is pure positive energy. when it hits your eardrums your brain warms up. then you feel good and you are back to yourself.. highly recommened..peace..
B00013F38K|1.0|This series is a joke. David Carradine's kung fu  is  LAME and he is a really bad actor. He's half  Chinese? What an insult. Bruce Lee was robbed of this role, and he could've mopped  the floor with Carradine with one hand. Laughably bad and boring series. A disgrace.
B0000013GT|5.0|I think this is the best Outkast album out there. This record flows from one track to the next. The lyrics are like vitamins, good for you. This record is worth the time and effort for me to write this review, it is worth the time to listen. This is a sick ass record. I have bought it twice now cause my original got stolen... i recommend this if you like good music.. peace..
B0000033P2|5.0|Yes, i'm a big progressive Rock fan. ELP, Rush, and Pink Floyd are my three fav bands. This very well may be my favorite album ever. I say you get it now befor anything else (unless you dont have DSM or moving pictures)<br />The Endless Enigma is most likely the best song on it. Hoedown makes for a great instrumental.
0786880708|5.0|This is a masterfully done book on Buddhist mindfulness meditation, presented for anyone - Buddhist or other - wishing to learn this wonderful technique.  Wherever You Go, There You Are manages to be both simply written and profound at the same time.  It's the type of book that can be read more than once, and each time you'll take away a little more from it.  If you would like to learn something about meditation as a way to enhance your life - and mindfulness meditation is a great choice for that - this book is a fine way to get started.
B00005Q45W|5.0|This album is surprisingly good. If fact, its better than anything Leonard Cohen did in his so called hey-day. Strange but his voice is actulaly more appealing to me now than in the 60s when he sounded like Bob Dylan, only not as good.<BR>The songs are different. Its not folk anymore, its much closer to RnB, but its still great. Very atmospheric and slow. All the songs are good, not one stinker in the whole album.
B00006JDVV|1.0|One regards &quot;Reign of Fire&quot; with awe. What a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea. Incredulity is our companion, and it is twofold: We cannot believe what happens in the movie, and we cannot believe that the movie was made.<br />Of course, in a story involving mankind's battle with fire-breathing dragons in the year 2020, there are a few factual matters you let slide. But the movie makes no sense on its own terms, let alone ours. And it is such a grim and dreary enterprise. One prays for a flower or a ray of sunshine as those grotty warriors clamber into their cellars and over their slag heaps. Not since &quot;Battleship Earth&quot; has there been worse grooming. <br />The story: A tunnel beneath London breaks open an underground cavern filled with long-dormant fire-breathing dragons. They fly to the surface and attack mankind. When one is destroyed, countless more take its place. Man's weapons only increase the damage. Soon, civilization has been all but wiped out; the heroes of the film cower in their underground hiding places and dream of defeating the dragons. <br />Along comes Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), the Dragon Slayer. He is bald and bearded, and his zealot's eyes focus in the middle distance as he speaks. He's the kind of tough guy who smokes cigar butts. Not cigars. Butts. He has a disagreement with Quinn (Christian Bale), the leader of the group. I am not sure why they so ferociously oppose each other, but I believe their quarrel comes down to: Van Zan thinks they have to fight the dragons, and Quinn thinks they have to fight the dragons but they have to look out real good, because those are dangerous dragons and might follow them home. <br />There's not much in the way of a plot. Alex (Izabella Scorupco) gets grubby and distraught while standing between the two men and trying to get them to stop shouting so much and listen to her scientific theories. Meanwhile, dragons attack, their animated wings beatingas they fry their enemies. Their animation is fairly good, although at one point a dragon in the background flies past the ruined dome of St. Paul's, and you can see one through the other, or vice versa. <br />I'm wondering, why, if civilization has been destroyed, do they have electricity and fuel? Not supposed to ask such questions. They're like, how come everybody has cigarettes in &quot;Waterworld&quot;? Van Zan figures out that the dragon's fire comes from the way they secrete the ingredients for &quot;natural napalm&quot; in their mouths. His plan: Get real close and fire an explosive arrow into their open mouth at the crucial moment, causing the napalm to blow up the dragon.<br />He has another bright idea. (Spoiler warning.) All of the dragons they see are females. Many of them carry eggs. Why no males? Because, Van Zan hypothesizes, the dragons are like fish, and it only takes a single male to fertilize umpteen eggs. &quot;We kill the male, we kill the species,&quot; he says. <br />Yeah, but ... there are dragons everywhere. Do they only have one male, total, singular? How about those eggs? Any of them male? And also, after the male is dead, presumably all of the females are still alive, and they must be mad as hell now that they're not getting any action. How come they stop attacking? <br />I know I have probably been inattentive, and that some of these points are solved with elegant precision in the screenplay. But please do not write to explain, unless you can answer me this: Why are the last words in the movie, &quot;Thank God for evolution&quot;? Could it be a ray of hope that the offspring of this movie may someday crawl up onto the land and develop a two-celled brain?
0446310786|4.0|As a teenager, I have read many classics. 'To Kill A Mockingbird' has to be one of my favorites. This book has many twists, however I found a few parts to be quite boring. I went through some of the book being anxious for it to be over, watching page by page go by thinking 'When is this going to get interesting? When is this going to end?' but once I hit the last 4 chapters, they flew by. The surprise ending was amazing, and at the end, I found myself thinking 'No, it can't be over yet!'. Although few parts didn't appeal much to me, overall I loved this book.
B00005JKN9|3.0|Martin Scorsese's &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; rips up the postcards of American history and reassembles them into a violent, blood-soaked story of our bare-knuckled past. The New York it portrays in the years between the 1840s and the Civil War is, as a character observes, &quot;the forge of hell,&quot; in which groups clear space by killing their rivals. Competing fire brigades and police forces fight in the streets, audiences throw rotten fruit at an actor portraying Abraham Lincoln, blacks and Irish are chased by mobs, and Navy ships fire on the city as the poor riot against the draft. <br />The film opens with an extraordinary scene set beneath tenements, in catacombs carved out of the Manhattan rock. An Irish-American leader named Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) prepares for battle almost as if preparing for the Mass--indeed, as he puts on a collar to protect his neck, we think for a moment he might be a priest. With his young son Amsterdam trailing behind, he walks through the labyrinth of this torchlit Hades, gathering his forces, the Dead Rabbits, before stalking out into daylight to fight the forces of a rival American-born gang, the Nativists. <br />Men use knives, swords, bayonets, cleavers, cudgels. The ferocity of their battle is animalistic. At the end, the field is littered with bodies--including that of Vallon, slain by his enemy William Cutting, aka Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). This was the famous gang fight of Five Points on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, recorded in American history but not underlined. When it is over, Amsterdam disappears into an orphanage, the ominously named Hellgate House of Reform. He emerges in his early 20s (now played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and returns to Five Points, still ruled by Bill, and begins a scheme to avenge his father. <br />The vivid achievement of Scorsese's film is to visualize this history and people it with characters of Dickensian grotesquerie. Bill the Butcher is one of the great characters in modern movies, with his strangely elaborate diction, his choked accent, his odd way of combining ruthlessness with philosophy. The canvas is filled with many other colorful characters, including a pickpocket named Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a hired club named Monk (Brendan Gleeson), the shopkeeper Happy Jack (John C. Reilly), and historical figures such as William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed (Jim Broadbent), ruler of corrupt Tammany Hall, and P.T. Barnum (Roger Ashton-Griffiths), whose museum of curiosities scarcely rivals the daily displays on the streets. <br />Scorsese's hero, Amsterdam, plays much the same role as a Dickens hero like David Copperfield or Oliver Twist: He is the eyes through which we see the others but is not the most colorful person on the canvas. Amsterdam is not as wild, as vicious or as eccentric as the people around him, and may not be any tougher than his eventual girlfriend Jenny, who like Nancy in Oliver Twist is a hellcat with a fierce loyalty to her man. DiCaprio's character, more focused and centered, is a useful contrast to the wild men around him.<br />Certainly, Day-Lewis is inspired by an intense ferocity, laced with humor and a certain analytical detachment, as Bill the Butcher. He is a fearsome man, fond of using his knife to tap his glass eye, and he uses a pig carcass to show Amsterdam the various ways to kill a man with a knife. Bill is a skilled knife artist, and terrifies Jenny, his target for a knife-throwing act, not only by coming close to killing her but also by his ornate and ominous word choices.<br />Diaz plays Jenny as a woman who at first insists on her own independence; as a pickpocket, she ranks high in the criminal hierarchy, and even dresses up to prey on the rich people uptown. But when she finally caves in to Amsterdam's love, she proves tender and loyal, in one love scene where they compare their scars, and another where she nurses him back to health.<br />The movie is straightforward in its cynicism about democracy at that time. Tammany Hall buys and sells votes, ethnic groups are delivered by their leaders, and when the wrong man is elected sheriff he does not serve for long. That American democracy emerged from this cauldron is miraculous. We put the Founding Fathers on our money, but these Founding Crooks for a long time held sway.<br />Scorsese is probably our greatest active American director (Robert Altman is another candidate), and he has given us so many masterpieces that this film, which from another director would be a triumph, arrives as a more measured accomplishment. It was a difficult film to make, as we know from the reports that drifted back from the vast and expensive sets constructed at Cinecitta in Rome. The budget was enormous, the running time was problematical.<br />The result is a considerable achievement, a revisionist history linking the birth of American democracy and American crime. It brings us astonishing sights, as in a scene that shows us the inside of a tenement, with families stacked on top of one another in rooms like shelves. Or in the ferocity of the Draft Riots, which all but destroyed the city. It is instructive to be reminded that modern America was forged not in quiet rooms by great men in wigs, but in the streets, in the clash of immigrant groups, in a bloody Darwinian struggle.<br />All of this is a triumph for Scorsese, and yet I do not think this film is in the first rank of his masterpieces. It is very good but not great. I wrote recently of &quot;GoodFellas&quot; that &quot;the film has the headlong momentum of a storyteller who knows he has a good one to share.&quot; I didn't feel that here. Scorsese's films usually leap joyfully onto the screen, the work of a master in command of his craft. Here there seems more struggle, more weight to overcome, more darkness. It is a story that Scorsese has filmed without entirely internalizing. The gangsters in his earlier films are motivated by greed, ego and power; they like nice cars,shoes, suits, dinners, women. They murder as a cost of doing business. The characters in &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; kill because they like to and want to. They are bloodthirsty, and motivated by hate. I think Scorsese liked the heroes of &quot;GoodFellas,&quot; &quot;Casino&quot; and &quot;Mean Streets,&quot; but I'm not sure he likes this crowd.

B00005JL78|5.0|At a time when movies think they have to choose between action and ideas, Steven Spielberg's \\"Minority Report\\" is a triumph--a film that works on our minds and our emotions. It is a thriller and a human story, a movie of ideas that's also a whodunit. Here is a master filmmaker at the top of his form, working with a star, Tom Cruise, who generates complex human feelings even while playing an action hero. <br />I complained earlier this summer of awkward joins between live action and CGI; I felt the action sequences in \\"Spider-Man\\" looked too cartoonish, and that \\"Star Wars Episode II,\\" by using computer effects to separate the human actors from the sets and CGI characters, felt disconnected and sterile. Now here is Spielberg using every trick in the book and matching them without seams, so that no matter how he's achieving his effects, the focus is always on the story and the characters. <br />The movie turns out to be eerily prescient, using the term \\"pre-crime\\" to describe stopping crimes before they happen; how could Spielberg have known the government would be using the same term this summer? In his film, inspired by but much expanded from a short story by Philip K. Dick, Tom Cruise is John Anderton, chief of the Department of Pre-Crime in the District of Columbia, where there has not been a murder in six years. Soon, it appears, there will be a murder--committed by Anderton himself. <br />The year is 2054. Futuristic skyscrapers coexist with the famous Washington monuments and houses from the 19th century. Anderton presides over an operation controlling three \\"Pre-Cogs,\\" precognitive humans who drift in a flotation tank, their brain waves tapped by computers. They're able to pick up thoughts of premeditated murders and warn the cops, who swoop down and arrest the would-be perpetrators before the killings can take place. <br />Because this is Washington, any government operation that is high-profile and successful inspires jealousy. Anderton's superior, bureau director Burgess (Max von Sydow) takes pride in him, and shields him from bureaucrats like Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), from the Justice Department. As the pre-crime strategy prepares to go national, Witwer seems to have doubts about its wisdom--or he is only jealous of its success? <br />Spielberg establishes these characters in a dazzling future world, created by art director Alex McDowell, that is so filled with details large and small that we stop trying to figure out everything and surrender with a sigh. Some of the details: a computer interface that floats in mid-air, manipulated by Cruise with the gestures of a symphony conductor; advertisements that crawl up the sides of walls and address you personally; cars that whisk around town on magnetic cushions; robotic \\"spiders\\" that can search a building in minutes by performing a retinal scan on everyone in it. \\"Blade Runner,\\" also inspired by a Dick story, shows a future world in decay; \\"Minority Report\\" offers a more optimistic preview. <br />The plot centers on a rare glitch in the visions of the Pre-Cogs. Although \\"the Pre-Cogs are never wrong,\\" we're told, \\"sometimes ... they disagree.\\" The dissenting Pre-Cog is said to have filed a minority report, and in the case of Anderton the report is crucial, because otherwise he seems a certain candidate for arrest as a pre-criminal. Of course, if you could outsmart the Pre-Cog system, you would have committed the perfect crime ...<br />Finding himself the hunted instead of the hunter, Anderton teams up with Agatha (Samantha Morton), one of the Pre-Cogs, who seemed to be trying to warn him of his danger. Because she floats in a fluid tank, Agatha's muscles are weakened (have Pre-Cogs any rights of their own?) and Anderton has to half-drag her as they flee from the pre-crime police. One virtuoso sequence shows her foreseeing the immediate future and advising Anderton about what to do to elude what the cops are going to do next. The choreography, timing and wit of this sequence make it, all by itself, worth the price of admission. <br />But there are other stunning sequences. Consider a scene where the \\"spiders\\" search a rooming house, and Anderton tries to elude capture by immersing himself in a tub of ice water. This sequence begins with an overhead cross-section of the apartment building and several of its inhabitants, and you would swear it has to be done with a computer, but no: This is an actual physical set, and the elegant camera moves were elaborately choreographed. It's typical of Spielberg that, having devised this astonishing sequence, he propels it for dramatic purposes and doesn't simply exploit it to show off his cleverness. And watch the exquisite timing as one of the spiders, on its way out, senses something and pauses in mid-step. <br />Tom Cruise's Anderton is an example of how a star's power can be used to add more dimension to a character than the screenplay might supply. He compels us to worry about him, and even in implausible action sequences (like falls from dizzying heights) he distracts us by making us care about the logic of the chase, not the possibility of the stunt. <br />Samantha Morton's character (is \\"Agatha\\" a nod to Miss Christie?) has few words and seems exhausted and frightened most of the time, providing an eerie counterpoint for Anderton's man of action. There is poignancy in her helplessness, and Spielberg shows it in a virtuoso two-shot, as she hangs over Anderton's shoulder while their eyes search desperately in opposite directions. This shot has genuine mystery. It has to do with the composition and lighting and timing and breathing, and like the entire movie it furthers the cold, frightening hostility of the world Anderton finds himself in. The cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, who has worked with Spielberg before (not least on \\"Schindler's List\\"), is able to get an effect that's powerful and yet bafflingly simple. <br />The plot I will avoid discussing in detail. It is as ingenious as any film noir screenplay, and plays fair better than some. It's told with such clarity that we're always sure what Spielberg wants us to think, suspect and know. And although there is a surprise at the end, there is no cheating: The crime story holds water. <br />American movies are in the midst of a transition period. Some directors place their trust in technology. Spielberg, who is a master of technology, trusts only story and character, and then uses everything else as a workman uses his tools. He makes \\"Minority Report\\" with the new technology; other directors seem to be trying to make their movies from it. This film is such a virtuoso high-wire act, daring so much, achieving it with such grace and skill. A masterpiece!
B000002WCJ|5.0|What else can be said about this masterpiece?? If you don't own it already, you need it now!! What are you waiting for????
B0000AQVCL|1.0|This album, frankly, sucks. It's part of a current movement towards retro (White Stripes, Strokes, Vines etc) but at least the White Stripes and Strokes come across as having some talent. Jet is just a blatant ripoff of the 50s and 60s era (even down to the noise in the background) and yet have the audacity to criticise DJs in their &quot;Roll Over DJ&quot; song. Hypocrisy at its sheer finest.
B000002UZ6|4.0|Years ago I was studying in Germany when Ike and Tina came to town.  I missed the show, but I'll never forget that a little over a month later when I returned home they showed up again in my home town area of Portland, Maine.  From Munich to Maine in the course of a month?  I was afraid they were following me.  <br />Actually, what I really thought was that everything I had read about them being among the hardest working (and hardest TOURING) acts in show business had to be true.  <br />Tina's ever-shifting fortunes in the ensuing years are well documented.  The break from Ike was, by all accounts, a matter of personal survival--but of course, it was a career setback.  There had been an unsuccessful solo album in the 70s, and of course, she had made an impression as a solo as the Acid Queen in the film version of TOMMY.  But once totally on her own, she was scraping by with small venue gigs and appearances on THE HOLLYWOOD SQUARES.  It was a rough time.<br />The comeback in '84 with PRIVATE DANCER was a welcome surprise.  Collaborating with established rockers like Mark Knopfler and Jeff Beck, it was a strong effort--a truly successful recorded work by an artist whose main claim to fame heretofore had rested on her live performances.  Songs like &quot;What's Got to Love With It&quot; and the title track were intelligently selected and had the added advantage of being simultaneously &quot;nice and easy&quot; and a little &quot;rough.&quot;  Lyrically, many of the tracks had a somewhat autobiographical quality.  No one knew at the time that &quot;What's Love Got to Do With It?&quot; would eventually be the title of a biographical film detailing her marital trauma, but certainly Tina's story had become well enough known for that song and many of the other tracks to have a powerful resonance.<br />Of course, the era of synth pop was just beginning and much of Tina's work from this era reflects that trend.  Some fans complained then and now that Tina was more suited to funkier, more soulful arrangements than many of the 80s tracks possessed. There is some evidence for that argument on this compilation argument.  Soulful numbers like &quot;I Can't Stand the Rain&quot; and the 90s version of &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot; seem a bit weakened by the synthesizer backings.  There's a kind of (unintended?) ironic quality to such tracks, however. Tina's gritty vocals pretty much overcome the artificiality of the arrangements. Still there's a lot to be said for the occasional lo-tech arrangements that crop up on this release.  &quot;Steamy Windows&quot; is down and dirty and, yes, downright steamy, with a back-up band that IS a real band.  Same with the closer &quot;Love Thing,&quot; which rocks harder than anything else in this collection. <br />You may notice that Tina tends to rely on the same songwriters on this release.  If it's not a Knight-Chapman (or Knight-Chinn-Chapman) composition, it seems to be a Britten-Lyle number (with a Kelly-Steinman number and Ann Peebles and Al Green classics thrown in for good measure).  There are probably advantages to having a stable of writers on call, but I would have preferred to see a bit more stylistic variety.  Britten and Lyle's &quot;What's Love Got to Do With It&quot; is the quintessential Tina Turner track(even though, as legend has it, she initially rejected the song).<BR>But &quot;Typical Male&quot; and &quot;What You Get Is What You See&quot;--also penned by Britten and Lyle--were only just OK.  Had Tina gone a bit furter afield for material, she might have come up with a bit less fluff and more filler.  Sometimes loyalty is not all it's cracked up to be.<br />But that's quibbling.  Tina Turner is one of those near critic-proof artist.  This compilation album is as good a sampling of her 80s and 90s work as you're going to find.  Among critics and  fans, there'll be some arguments about whether this or that track should have been included and others excluded.  Arguments of that are almost inevitable with &quot;best-of&quot; albums.  I just wish my particular copy actually included the one pre-solo track that's listed above and commented on by many.  I would have welcomed the inclusion of the Spectoral &quot;River Deep Mountain High&quot;--but my version doesn't have it.  What gives? Licensing problems with later pressings?
B00005NRO3|5.0|Scream was awsome!!! Scream 2 is just as awsome if not better!!!<BR>Think about all the horror sequels over the years, they never even came close to being as good as the original. Halloween II was ok, but it was no Halloween. Friday part 2 just sucked. The second Nightmare was also a disaster. Thats where Scream 2 is different, way different! What can I say, it is one of the best horror movies ever made!!!
078681859X|5.0|The  Bartimaeus Trilogy is a great read.  In some ways it is like the Harry Potter series or more influenced by the Harry Potter series.  I think that Harry Potter is a much more powerful story with better plot and fleshed out but the Djinn in this story is a work of art.  As Harry Potter focus on medieval magic  this one is more New age meets Disney. Jonathan Stroud is a great writer and I cant wait for part two to come out. Other books to check like this:<br />\\"Lord of the Rings\\" By the King of fantasy <BR>\\"All Harry potter stuff\\" from the Queen of fantasy Rowling<BR>\\"Shadowmancer\\" by up and coming G.P. Taylor<BR>\\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" By the Don of fantasy C. S. Lewis<BR>\\"His Dark Materials Trilogy\\" from the leader of the Republic Philip Pullman
B00013PHGS|4.0|I wonder what makes people buy an album. Is it to repeat a unique pleasure, or to discover new forms of prolonging it? With Air's new one I can only think both reasons would apply. It is true that Moon safari will always stand as a groundbreaking collection of fine music, that the Virgin Suicides soundtrack will be seen as a symphony for the awaken dreamer, and that 10,000 HZ legend will be remembered as that radio friendly little brat. But it is not late to start fresh. And that is the mere premise of Talkie walkie. &quot;Venus&quot; is an irresistible melody that shows the entrance to the adventure. &quot;Cherry blossom girl&quot;, the lead single, works as the intro and beginning of the ride. While &quot;Mike Mills&quot; and &quot;Surfing on a rocket&quot; have us craving for more. By the time you reach the return point with &quot;Biological&quot; and &quot;Alone in Kyoto&quot; (previously heard in the movie Lost in translation), you will be looking for the continuous playing button in your favorite device. Forget the comparisons with the past , appreciate this for what it is: a trip around the shinnier corners of the mind and back. Are you up for some air already?
B000066JES|1.0|2 or 3 good songs, the rest is not even remotely metal- not even rock music! someone please tell me what the @#*# is &quot;American Trilogy&quot;??!! I understand they wanted to do something patriotic, but this is just stupid and the whole cd is a big insult to Manowar fans and metal fans in general. I sold this cd used for 3 bucks 2 weeks after it came out. I hope they never do anything like this again.
B0000CAQ27|4.0|Pink is back with another good album but more rockish than her previous two albums.this album contains a mix between 70's rock and pop.my favorites are:god is a dj-last to know-catch me while i'm sleeping-try too hard-humble neighborhoods.<BR>If you like rock music and pink then buy this album and i'm sure that you will not be dissapointed.
0783204914|5.0|Martin Brest's SCENT OF A WOMAN (1992) is a film well worth watching, and perhaps owning on video or DVD.  Beyond the rather slow pace and the tough-talking of some of its characters, this tale is a thoughtful and incisive look at human behavior and how life experiences can shape it.  It looks at how certain people handle adversity and what lessons they can ultimately derive from it.  If this analysis makes SCENT OF A WOMAN sound boring, please forgive me, for it is anything but boring.  This is a story about how real people react to real situations, and I'll be surprised if most people couldn't relate to at least one of the several major characters in it.  The film's characters are, by the way, anything but boring; rather, they are memorable and true-to-life.<br />Chris O'Donnell was very young (only 22) when he played Charlie Simms in this, only his third movie role and first starring one.  You could say that he had his work cut out for him, as his co-star is living legend Al Pacino, as Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.  As you know by now, Charlie, a college student in hot water with the detestable Dean Trask (James Rebhorn, in another significant and well-played character role), gets himself assigned to the task of looking after the blind, bullying and seemingly unlikable Frank for Thanksgiving weekend.  As I'm sure you also know, Frank is suicidal and is planning on doing himself in, but not before treating himself to last weekend of wine, women and song--and bringing Charlie along for the ride, whether he likes it or not!  This story is about their weekend, and how each man is changed for the better, complete with a wonderful payoff at the end.<br />When we first meet Frank Slade, we wonder if we can really spend a long time with him (this movie is 2 hours and 42 minutes long, although Frank is introduced about 20 minutes into it).  But the way in which Charlie influences his character growth really holds our attention. Eventually, we come to care so much aboutFrank through the realization that he is not a one-dimensional monster but a damaged human being; one that is more in need of redemption than offing.<br />SCENT OF A WOMAN is extremely well-acted by everyone.  Al Pacino's memorable and infectious performance finally won him the Oscar for Best Actor that he had long deserved.  Perhaps even more impressively, Chris O'Donnell (keep in mind that this was only his third film ever) provides an effective counterpart; both actors create believable and effective chemistry in their interaction. A very young Philip Seymour Hoffman is also memorable in a showy supporting role. This is one of those films in which if you've never seen it before, it will make you smile.  Just don't be put off by its length; the characters and storyline will make you care enough to stick with it.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
6305903182|5.0|Ok, Scream 3 isn't as good as the first two, but it is still one of the best horror movies I've ever seen. The ending is something you would never expect. I just wish they wouldn't have changed Gale Weathers, she looks completly different. She is so skinny you can't hardly tell that it is her. I definetly recommend buying this movie. Actually, you should buy the trilogy box set for only $35.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is what is wildly mindblowing about this movie: Showing the most, just mind snapping human behavior, in such an ordinary sleepy bystanderish type way.  No filmmaking dramatization is required because you can't even believe what these people are doing to their own kind.  Very focused, intimate, personal view.
B00005NB8K|2.0|This movie was ok in the beginning. It was somewhat interesting watching him get messed up and stuff but after two hours of the same thing it was just too much. I doubt much of this movie is true. So if you want to see a movie glorifying jim morrisons' drug abuse and &quot;super deep&quot; lyrics this is right up your alley.
B00005OAIE|5.0|i have a wide expanse for music appreciation, this guy is special, havent read anyone's comment connecting he and michael franks...think about it! he and norah jones are 2 that will live on in ears for a very long long time
B00004W52U|5.0|1,000 words. too many to describe one of the best bands ever, not to mention the single most influential band in ska/punk history. just buy the CD. you will love it. and that's a statement.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|After getting Low I got this album and at first I didn't like it but a few more airplays and I think it's great. I still think though that the best tracks here are Ashes to Ashes and Fashion but there's much to admire here.

0425188809|5.0|A man named Travis finds a dog named Einstien with almost human like intelligence, and is impressed with all of the amazing things he can do. Einstein was created to be part of a government project refered to as the &quot;Francis Project&quot; that consists of Einstien and a killer monster functioning as a team to help soldiers out in battle. Unfortunately, the monster develops a hatred for the dog, and it has also escaped to kill Einstein and anyone else that gets in its way. Travis takes Einstien in, and has no idea about what is coming. Around the same time, Travis meets and falls in love with a woman named Nora who is now also in danger. To make matters worse, there is a professional hitman named Vince Nasco who has been tracking Einstien himself after he learned about the Francis Project through the people he was hired to kill. With danger on all sides, Travis, Nora, and Einstien must go on the run and try to survive! <br />If you are a fan of Dean Koontz you have most lilkely heard of this book's reputation. Countless fans of Koontz claim that &quot;Watchers&quot; is his best book. This is the one time you should believe the hype, because it is his best book. &quot;Watchers&quot; is a suspenseful and terrifying book, that will make you an instant fan of Dean Koontz. I consider it a literary masterpiece that any fan of fiction should read. It offers a thrilling story with non-stop action and terror. Koontz's character development is at its all time best in this book. Travis and Nora, the dog Einstien, the hitman Vince Nasco, and the monster itself are all well developed and facinating. Koontz makes you fall in love with all of the characters, and this is one of the only books I have ever read, where you end up rooting for the bad guys at times.  <br />This is definately Koontz's best book, and one of my favorite novels over all. Watchers is a complex story of love, greed, determination, friendship , and terrifying horror. It has something for everyone and the story never gets slow or boring. I have to warn you though, that some of the scenes in this book are terrifying and rather graphic. I found myself flinching at times. This book is also extremely hard to put down as well. I spent an entire day reading this book, and focused on nothing else until I finished it.
B000056K04|5.0|Some people may say that this CD and Busted Stuff is their worst two albums' and I strongly disagree. I cannot get enough of this CD or Busted Stuff. Leroi really plays like i don't know what in track 9,but the sax part in that song is wonderful.
6302752337|5.0|This is one classic flick. It is very thought provoking,  <BR> interesting, enlightening, and generally fun (until the end).<BR> I am a criminology professor, and find this movie very<BR> appropriate as a teaching tool and as a means to stimulate<BR> critical conversations.

B00011V8CW|4.0|This is a good album by Bowie - disguising the past he had with Tin Machine fairly well ( although some are still scarred by the memory ). The set here is competent but by no means classic. It certainly falters a bit and that Morrissey cover is just awful but I'm getting used to it. The second CD doesn't really get started until the fourth track - the first 3 are OK but aren't special but the remixes add a new light on the album and perhaps seem a suggestion towards making albums like Earthling ( still something I'd rather not hear ). The DVD here though may seem pretensious to some but I think it was interesting. I didn't have a problem with the conversation going all over the place - I knew how to seperate one from the other<br />I'm surprised that when this was reissued it didn't come up with the single CD version like it has in the rest of Europe - wonder if something up with the distributers. But it is essential for any Bowie fan but perhaps they'd just want the one CD instead of the extras. Whatever the choice they shouldn't be disappointed once they don't expect a stellar classic - it's good but it's not that good!
B00005JMFI|5.0|This guy reminds me of the Grinch, Mr. Scrooge and Mr. Marley all rolled up into one. This is a wonderful movie that will bring a tear to your eye at the end. Anyone with kids especially very young ones, should see it and buy it.<br />An old codger!!!
B00005JLSE|4.0|Now I have seen the original broadway musical in 1997 when BEBE NEwirth(lillith from Cheers) was Velma. yo ucan't compare a movie to broadway.there will always be die hards who don't want Fosse's work tampered with, but it's hollywood.  I like the movie  it is updated to our tastes not in the 70's. and who knew Richard Gere can sing and dance...I saw this in the movie theatre.And only problem i had (I seen the movie on cable several times this month as well) when Catherine sang all that jazz, she didn't out enough feeling into the song and not in the correct order of stances.But watching the movie, it fit together. Yes, they skipped a few songs from the original musical,but I felt the story made more sense in the movie version,since i seen the musical for me I recommend it to anyone.
0790729725|4.0|It's understandable that so many people feel compelled to compare GoodFellas to The Godfather (Parts 1 and 2) or more recently to the Sopranos ... all of them are great mob stories and a lot more than that. <br />But to give this movie its due, it has almost nothing to do with the Godfather films ... GoodFellas  has a flavor of reality that makes it unlike any other mob story. From the opening scene, in which Liota, DeNiro, and Pesci are are driving through the night in a rumbling Buick on some evil mission (you don't find out right away, at least not why they're doing what they're doing, but you find out soon enough), GoodFellas has a certain randomness in the way in combines violence, humor, and personal relationships that makes it ring absolutely true. <br />It's not a neatly constructed story -- the movie follows Henry Hill's life in a semi-chronological order and at the end the story kind of peters out -- but the power of Scorcese's filmmaking is such that you really don't mind. An absolute classic.<br />***BUT*** the DVD features are inexcusably lame: there are bascially no extras (OK, the theatrical trailer, which shows that the marketers really didn't know what they had, is kind of interesting but that's about it) and, worst of all, you have to turn the disc over in the middle of the movie. A contemporary classic film like \\"GoodFellas\\" is just crying out for a director's commentary, some outtakes, etc. Where are they???
B0000024K1|5.0|Considering I don't like much rap music but for this I'll make a major exception. This is the most explosive thing I've ever heard and must be in everybody's collection. This is intelligently done and Chuck D brings the venom while Flavor Flav brings the humour.<br />Recommmended
B00008HCCF|5.0|Beautiful vocals meet beautiful instrumentals for a night at the House of Blues!  What more could you want?  Many of the live versions on this DVD are cleaner than the album versions.  The sound quality is outstanding and the video is, of course, DVD-crisp.  The songs which are not on the album are exceptional.  Bessie Smith and Tennesee Waltz (the Encore) are worth the price alone!<br />P.S. For all the reviewers who are talking about Ms. Jones sweating....it's not sweat!  It's sparkly stage makeup.  I know this because my sister was a ballet dancer and still wears the stuff....
0553277472|5.0|This book is truly amazing. It opens doors to questions that one never asks. For the days I spent reading this book I was lost in a daze of questions and thoughts which caused me to rethink everything I'd learned. <br />Pirsig takes the reader through a beautiful chautauqa that concerns itself with the question of truth and quality. Pirsig takes the reader on an adventure as he goes on a motorcycle trip with his son across the states. As he develops the ideas of his former self, Phaedrus, (before he was treated for mental illness) he faces an internal struggle between his true self and the new identity he has been forced to adopt. Beautifully written, the book mixes Pirsig's philosophical queries with the story of his journey and leads the reader to amazing epiphanies and insights. The story makes you realize how learning has forced students to imitate what is taught, rather than using their own thoughts to come up with original material.<br />A fascinating book, it seems to be one that everyone loves and many find life altering. Definetly a book to read again and again and again.
0385510438|2.0|Master storyteller has tried to view at the legal proceedings with a journalist's (who is an outright opportunist, albeit with some moral standing) perspective. The descriptions of the events in the courtroom are pretty repetitive. A nasty defence lawyer with no ethical groundings, a domineering judge who's supportive to the victim, a diverse and vacillating jury and a small town setting. Sounds familier? <BR>But all said and done, there are very few individuals who can spin a story around a single disturbing event. Although this time, the most critical ingredient of Grisham's tales is lacking. Strong characters. Be it The Rainmaker, The Firm or even the offbeat A Painted House, they all had very well defined characters who all had a role to play in the climax of the story. This is where the book falls short of expectations. Perhaps the element of suspense would have saved the day. But the suspense builds up in parts and looses momentum midway before picking up little bit in the end. A uniform thread of suspense would have held the diverse events together.<BR>Maybe something better is coming our way from Grisham next time!
B00005UW7G|4.0|This was a fantastic experience for me in that the sum of the parts was greater than the whole.  If I had to rate parts individually, I would Rate Cinema effects 3, Audio 2 Acting 3 Singing 3 (because much of it appeared to  be lip synched).  Nevertheless, the Italian country side views were exquisite! If you compare this work to a visit to  La Scala, you'll be diappointed.  But if you compare it a   good movie, you'll be happy.  In this context I rated it a 4 to Amadeus' 5.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|Who is sublimely different from everyone else out there.  The Beatles stormed the world in the '60s and changed the face of music forever.  John Lennon and Paul McCartney get constant praise for being an incredible song writing team... and I can't argue there.  But what about George?  He is, and will always be, my favorite Beatle.  He was always so straight-forward and sarcastic and spiritual.  He was a rare human being and the music industry was lucky to have him.  And man, could he write a song!  I have many of George's albums and I am planning on getting them all eventually.  When I heard that all of his out-of-print albums were coming back out, I was ecstatic.  &quot;Cloud 9&quot; is the best of these re-releases.  Its almost on the level of &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; and certainly right up there with &quot;Brainwashed&quot; and &quot;Living in the Material World&quot;.<br />This album has a bit of an '80s feel to it, but that's okay.  The song writing more than makes up for that.  Every song on this album is a treasure.  All are catchy, with a nice riff or a great chorus.  Every single song is trying to say something and doing it well.  George sounds almost joyful on this album.  He's just enjoying making music.  <br />Highlights include: &quot;Cloud 9&quot;, &quot;Fish on the Sand&quot;, &quot;When We Was Fab&quot;, &quot;Devel's Radio&quot;, &quot;Breath Away from Heaven&quot; and, of course, &quot;I've Got My Mind Set On You&quot;.  <br />God bless you George, and may you rest in peace.
B00006HBUA|5.0|I thought this movie was going to be a little lame but I'm so glad that I saw it because it was way better than I expected it to be. Its a hilarious and goofy comedy. I enjoyed it. The script was funny, the actors hilarious, the sets were awesome. I loved this movie and it is much better than I thought it would be. Give this one a chance. I highly recommend it.
B000099T2L|5.0|Looky, Beyonce can sing her @$$ off! She has the greatest voice out in R&amp;B, yeah R&amp;B. All the people mad at Beyonce jus because she ain't poppy anyomre. I'm so glad she isn't. She needed to go to a genre where she can really show her singing ability. Don't get me wrong, I loved THE ORIGINAL Destiny's Child, not that Survivor $hit. Back then the group sounded good, and Beyonce knows it. With the pop Beyonce felt trapped. She needed to escape and show her stuff, and she has on her solo cd. With the exception of &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;, Beyonce isn't trying to target her mainstream audience. She's broadening her fan base and experiment with other subjects beside being &quot;Bootylicious&quot; and hatin on other girls &quot;So Good, Fancy&quot;. She has put emotion into this cd and shows her true side. And by the way, all the songs do not sound the same. Every song has it's own unique sound. Anyway, I don't want to go off on a tangent, so I won't. Back to the cd, I don't like it that she put &quot;Dangerously In Love 2&quot; on here. She needs to put &quot;My Heart Still Beats&quot; on here, that sounded much better, if she wants to add a song from SURVIVOR. All in all, this isn't that Radio Disney $hit that SURVIVOR was, this is for older people. By the way, many of the reviewers for this cd previous to mine are probably under the age of 18, so how in the world would they know what good music is anyway! Beyonce has got some pipes. I Love You Beyonce! (Te Amo)

B00006CXXU|3.0|I don't really know why I bought this album.  I hate pop music and want the American public's fascination with it to end.  I listen to classic rock.  But I also listen to female artists with good voices.  And guess what?  I couldn't resist because of \\"Beautiful\\".  <br />People are praising this album like its the Second Coming.  But out of 20 songs, only a handful are good.  The overtly sexual songs, the hip hop songs and the interludes are all bad.  However, sometimes I take out this album and skip to the songs I do like.  Those will be the songs I review here.  The rest are the reason this album got only three stars.<br />1) Walk Away- Christina's voice sounds fantastic here.  A wonderful ballad.<BR>2) Impossible- Alicia Keys wrote it so it had to be good, right?  This one has a very R&B feel to it.  I love it.<BR>3) Beautiful- Obviously, an amazing song.  Such a great melody and message.  And man, can Christina sing!<BR>4) Cruz- A lovely and peacful song with nice harmonies.<BR>5) The Voice Within- My favorite song of the bunch.  Not only does it have a great message, but Christina really sings it!<BR>6) I'm OK- Packs such emotional punch.  You can actually hear Christina start to cry at one point.<br />If Christina Aguilera would start focusing on her beautiful voice and dress less like a prostitute, she would get more respect in the music industry.  An album full of songs like the six above would have gotten five stars.
B0000508U6|5.0|With Coldplay's debut single, Yellow, I remembered hearing lots of fuss about how great the band was. I had heard the song, and I thought it was merely ok. My friend raved to me about how great the album Parachutes was, and yet in my own ignorance I shrugged his advice to get the CD off and went back to listening to the horrible nonsense music I was a slave to at that time. After quite some time, one day I saw the CD on sale for $9.99 and thought what the heck, I need to buy this CD and see what all the talk is about. I bought the CD and took it home for a straight-through listen, without interuption... and loud.<br />The result: I am ashamed of my actions prior to listening to Parachutes. My friend should have beat me up. Coldplay is now my favorite band. Parachutes is one of the most vivid and hypnotic listening experiences I've ever had. Chris Martin's voice is as haunting as it is beautiful. The band finds chords and musical landscapes that create a kind of world of sound to get lost in. Coldplay has found a truly original sound.<br />The entire album is classic, but here are some highlights: Yellow - it's a dreamlike anthem of love that grabs you and doesn't let go... makes you want to sing along as loud as you can. Shiver - this song has brought me to tears on more than one occasion. No song before has so greatly personified the heart and mind of the eternally hopeful yet forgotten lover. Spies - an eerie, entrancing hymn of paranoia. Trouble - a deep, sincere apology with an almost lullaby-like piano tune. I find myself singing it often. Higher Speed - a trance, an experience... this is the hardest song on the album for me to describe. One of the most soothing tracks. Everything's Not Lost - if you listen closely, you'll realize Chris Martin really is singing to YOU. This is a timeless song of optimism that always reminds you the glass is half full.<br />With Chris Martin in the spotlight 90% of the time (and there's no wonder why), I think it's important to point out that<br />Coldplay is a great BAND. Jonny Buckland (lead guitar) is the one you hear sliding the guitar to death and making it produce sounds you never thought existed. Will Champion (drums) is spot on accurate with every beat. Guy Berryman (bass) takes care of those low notes that everything else seems to rest on... listen closely and you'll hear what I'm talking about.<br />It's hard to believe that Parachutes is actually a debut album. I imagine the dreamy soundscape Coldplay has begun painting will only become more lucid and spellbinding as each new album is released.<br />Parachutes is a must-have album.point out that <BR>Coldplay is a great BAND.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I'm absolutely loving this CD!!  This is the best work Britney's ever done without a doubt.  There's so many amazing tracks on the album, especially Breathe on Me &amp; Touch of My Hand.  These are two of the best songs I've ever heard and I never thought anything of the sort would come from Britney.  She has definitely surprised me and a lot of other people with this album and I'm sure she'll continue to surprise us in the future.  This album proves that she has what it takes to have longevity - GOOD MUSIC!!
0452283760|4.0|Ayn Rand managed to find the perfect way to capture my attention, because I am an architecture nut. Maybe it comes from growing up in Chicago--Frank Lloyd Wright territory. At any rate, early in the book, the protagonist Howard Roark is &quot;accused&quot; of designing buildings that don't look like anyone else's. They're great, as everyone with an eye for architecture can see, but they don't conform to everyone else's expectations. I can relate to that, because I am a struggling fiction writer, and have yet to &quot;categorize&quot; my own writing. Reading Rand made me realize that this is not such a bad thing. This is a story about the value of achievement, and how the world is made better by the unique contributions of creative minds.<br />To get the story of The Fountainhead, you can rent the movie (which is great, and stars two of my favorites, Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal). However, to get the flavor of Rand's ideas, you need to read the book. In fact, if you have a serious interest in philosophy, it might not hurt to read all of her books. The fiction is mostly just an excuse to expound upon the philosophy.<br />I read The Fountainhead at a time when I was pretty aimless in life, and so I'd have to say that the book gave me courage and the desire to read more Rand. I did. This is probably Rand's best piece of fiction. Atlas Shrugged, while impressive for its relentless, moral defense of capitalism, is more of an extended lecture in philosophy.<br />I read one review which referred to the behavior in this book as &quot;masochistic&quot; or &quot;sadistic.&quot; I think, somehow, that that's a misreading of the text. You have to accept (at least for the purpose of &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot;) the author's viewpoint, or you just won't get where these characters are coming from.<br />There are strong characters and there are weak characters. The strong characters' &quot;masochism&quot; derives from their temporary willingness to submit to the whims of others. The weak characters' masochism comes from deliberately submitting themselves to the whims of others when they KNOW that others are wrong but don't have the strength of character to stand up for themselves. Rand's vision is not compromising, nor terribly sympathetic, but it does make you think.<br />I will add one bit that I read somewhere else. Frank Lloyd Wright, when asked about The Fountainhead, said that Rand neglected to include those moments when an architect laughs, looks at a problem from a new light, and says, &quot;What a fool I've been!&quot; I agree, and that is where I part company from Rand.

B00006879E|1.0|I bought this CD on a whim, which is something I rarely do.  I usually haveto have a good reason for buying music, because I am very proud of my CD collection and I don't like having weak albums on my shelves.  I mostly listen to classic rock (Beatles, Stones, Zeppelin, Cream among my favs) but I am also a fan of some of today's music.  SOME of today's music.  I may be 16, but I have taste.  I would rather lose an arm and a leg than listen to any of the Britney clones, horrible rappers or so-called &quot;rock&quot; bands parading through the industry today.  <br />However, I heard the song &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; several times and I thought it was one of the most interesting songs to come out in awhile.  I thought that this band must be a breath of fresh air.  The melody was so dark and unlike any of recent years.  Then I heard the catchy &quot;This Love&quot; and I thought for sure that the band was great.  I picked up a copy of this album.  Mistake!<br />The first two songs (&quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and &quot;This Love&quot;) are good.  They aren't the most amazing pieces of music from recent years, but they are original.  I listened to those two songs and got all geared up for the rest of the album.  Too bad the rest of the album sucks.  It's boring, all the songs sound the same, and Maroon 5 turns out to basically be a glorified boy-band, disguised by the fact that they play instruments.  The harmonies, the melodies... they all sound just like all that other trash out there.  I am sorely disppointed in this CD and I haven't listened to it since the day I bought it.<br />If you think this deserves five stars, do yourself a favor.  Pick up some REAL music.  Start with the Beatles, the Stones, the Who, Led Zeppelin, Cream, Hendrix, etc.  You can also listen to modern music that is good (stuff like the White Stripes and the Red Hot Chili Peppers).  Trust me.  Its blows this crap out of the water.
B000069AUI|5.0|Only two short years after Coldplay's debut with the already classic Parachutes, they've come back with a brand new album, and this time... it's even better! I fell in love with Coldplay's first album, Parachutes, and the fact that A Rush of Blood To The Head goes above and beyond the listening experience of Parachutes puts me quite beside myself.<br />With the opening track, Politik, the album takes off with a visceral punch that the first album never quite achieved. Politik immediately let's us know that Chris Martin and company have plunged even deeper into their souls to create an album that would surely touch our own souls... and it has deeply touched mine. As I'm listening to Politik for the thousandth time, it's still hard not to let the song take over my emotions and push me to tears. The next track is In My Place. This beautiful track seems to be part two to Parachute's Shiver, and it continues the theme of being loveless yet in love with the same potency and bittersweet urgency as the former. God Put A Smile Upon Your Face, the next track, gets us up and speeding through Coldplay's now familiar landscape of lucid sounds and thoughtful lyrics... I find myself singing and bobbing my head along with this song without even knowing it. The Scientist, the next song, is one of the gems on this album. Martin and company have created a kind of requiem for love with The Scientist. The melody is simple yet endlessly soothing... it's an instant classic. And now I get to rave. Clocks, the next track, is quite simply the greatest song these ears have ever heard. The piano melody in Clocks seems to have come from heaven. I can listen to this song over and over and over again. Every time I hear it I'm in a trance. I could write forever about why this song is so great. And as to what Martin is singing about... we may never know... but I actually think he may be singing about sleep (bed)... read the lyrics and try to connect the dots... email if me if you can't see why. Daylight, the following track, is intense, distinct, and fresh. It marches to a different tune than most of Coldplay's songs, and that's why it's great. Green Eyes slows things down with its mild acoustics and laid back lyrics... another good love song. Warning Sign is one of my favorites. It's another one that is just so fresh to me... fresh even for Coldplay... and it's such a mesmerizing love song. Whisper gets loud, yet stays coherent... when listening to this track I always seem to get lost in my thoughts. A Rush Of Blood To The Head, the title track, seems to be one of Coldplay's more personal tracks. It always puts me in a nostalgic mood. The final track, Amsterdam (and I have no idea why it's titled that), is a great song. It definately lets you know you're at the end of the album... for it is such a magnificent ending.<br />I discussed every track because every track is great. This is an album that I listen to straight through more often than not.<br />Coldplay has made a kind of eternal impact on my life with A Rush Of Blood To The Head. It is simply an album that must be experienced... and listened to over and over again. With this only being Coldplay's second album, they still have so much time left to make music... I cannot wait to see what the future holds.<br />I love Coldplay. I recommend this album to anyone and everyone.light, the following track, is intense, distinct, and fresh.

B0000DD7LB|5.0|Gotta give Britney mad props for making such a great album!  I was hesitant to pick this one up, but after my friend played me a few tracks, I decided to give it a try.  Wow, I'm glad I did cause I'm digging this album more than I ever thought I would!  There's an amazing variety of sounds and all of them suit Britney's voice really well.  I never realized until now how incredibly versatile her voice is!  On some tracks, she sounds sugary and sweet, on other tracks she sounds deep and soulful.  I'd say the highlight tracks are: Me Against the Music, Boom Boom, Breathe on Me, Toxic, Touch of My Hand, and Everytime.  Every single track is good though and I can listen to the whole thing without skipping.  I highly suggest you pick this one up, you won't regret it.
0767805712|4.0|This film does not look like most science fiction films you've seen. It looks like an urban fantasy, with lots of clean, straight lines, cold concrete, and some dark alleys. Everyone is dressed in suits or other stylish outfits, and there are only passing references to space. This film is a near-future look at how our society could mutate as a result of emphasis and dependence upon genetic engineering. I found the film disturbingly (and depressingly) real.<br />I came out of GATTACA asking myself a lot of questions, which is perhaps the main thrust of the film. There are few hammer blows, not so many messages as situations that unfold, and the viewer is left wanting to know more.<br />I'd say this is science fiction for people who usually don't like science fiction. It is very close to reality, and bears watching and taking seriously. But if you're looking for answers to a future based on genetic prejudice, you won't find many here, just more questions.<br />Some Additional Thoughts After a Recent Rental<br />I liked author Gore Vidal's performance in this film as a chilly, snobbish space mission director. He uses the same sort of language you usually hear in films about country clubs or fraternities trying to exclude \\"those people,\\" whatever outside group that might be.<br />Also, I must again emphasize the sterile look to this place. The buildings and suits are all very \\"clean\\" looking. Even the astronauts go into space in suits! This is a very corporate environment, at the high end of the price scale.<br />In the midst of the film is a murder mystery. The Mission Control director is killed, and the only trace of suspicion the police have is a single eyelash from an \\"Invalid,\\" a genetically-deprived individual. The mystery, to the police, is how an Invalid could have gotten into GATTACA, the company launching rockets into space. After all, \\"they\\" have weaker hearts, lesser intelligence, weaker vision; they're almost another race! Something to consider for the future, anyway.<br />I must also point out the incredible lengths the hero (Hawke) goes to disguise his true nature: scraping skin cells, making fake fingerprints, borrowing blood and urine samples from a \\"Valid\\" who has fallen from grace. The man Hawke borrows fluids and identities from is a gifted swimmer who had the bad luck to come in second in a race. Unable to cope with the failure of his assumed superiority, he walks in front of a car, paralyzing his legs. Indeed, the work ethic of the \\"invalids\\" versus the complacency of the \\"valids\\" is telling.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A proper explanation of Firefly, would be a difficult prospect to undertake indeed.  Yes, the ensemble cast of talented actors would be a good beginning, but what of the heart and soul of the show, the creator Joss Whedon.  Why is Whedon such an asset to Firefly.  His dialogue fires the heart, and expands the mind, it is considered by many to be the best of his generation. Dialogue is only part of the equation, he excels at bringing together talented artists to bring his vision to life. These artists brought with them a unique vision, one that has never been seen on american television before. Revolutionary lighting, sound, and camera work has put Firefly ahead of it's time. The complexities of Joss Whedon's vision, may have confused the mundane drones that initiate policy in the industry today, but the vision will endure.

0441172717|5.0|Anyone who read Dune prior to the early 1990s will see that Frank Herbert had an excellent grasp of the politics of petroleum. Anyone reading the book after Desert Storm will probably get the creeps. If you read the author's preface to the short story collection Eye, you can see that Herbert was interested in describing the interworkings of business and politics, as well as the effect of \\"hydraulic despotism.\\" (Hydraulic despotism, by the way, is what happens when an area is dependent upon one stream of water for the basics of life and somebody upstream attempts to dam it to gain control over the people downstream, exactly what happened in the 1973-74 oil shocks and in Desert Shield/Storm.) That's just the politics of it.<br />Herbert also examined the role of religion in politics, and thus we have the Fremen, a \\"Zensunni\\" group of fanatic beliefs (Ascetic Buddhism combined with Islam), made ferocious by their efforts to survive the desert landscape of Arrakis, the planet known as \\"Dune.\\" Herbert creates or extrapolates some really remarkable technologies for drawing or retaining moisture from the desert air.<br />What really grabbed me about Dune, though, was the first third of the book, when we observe the society of the Great Houses of his futuristic Galactic Empire. For as much as the David Lynch film was panned by the critics, the movie got the \\"look\\" of this society dead right. It is a form of straightforward feudalism, with the primary spoils and properties being planets, commodities, and shares in the overarching Imperial corporation, CHOAM (Combine Honnette Ober Advancer Mercantiles, if that helps you any). The feudal arrangements of the Empire are complex and fascinating. The Imperial House rules by fear (Herbert's version of Stormtroopers or the Praetorian Guard, the Saudaukar), and the Great Houses of the Landsraad (legislature) fight amongst themselves for the scraps that remain. The opening story is a fight between two of these Great Houses, House Atreides and House Harkonnen. They war openly and by stealth, using blatant and subtle means of inflicting damage. A \\"Medici\\" look is entirely appropriate to their world.<br />Into this mix, Herbert also included the Bene Tleilax, a totally amoral technocracy focusing upon genetic engineering. The people of Ix are likewise technocrats, but focus upon standard machinery. Technology is slowly developed and unobtrusive. Instead of computers, there are humans trained as \\"mentats;\\" instead of disks or magnetic tapes, there are \\"scrolls\\" or \\"cielagos\\" (coded data transcribed into and relayed by a human or animal). There are also the Bene Gesserit, a group of women similar to Catholic nuns in their appearance and behavior. They endeavor to manipulate bloodlines in order to improve the human species. They wish to create the \\"kwisatz haderach,\\" a man with the powers of a Bene Gesserit (contacting the memories of female ancestors, ability to transmute poisons, yoga-type mental and muscular disciplines).<br />Does all this sound incredibly complex and heavy? It is. That is part of what makes the book fascinating and difficult to read. Herbert has gone to the trouble to create an entire world, recognizably human, brutal, and unlikable at times, but very convincing and well-thought-out. As a story, all of this must be explained while the plot advances forward. This Herbert manages to do, as well as insert a great deal of philosophical and political thought. This is one of the best-wrought works in the science fiction canon. Alas, it can almost be too hard to read. Go forth bravely, and you will be rewarded.ides and House Harkonnen.

B00005YUNY|5.0|If you a Yes fan you will find this performance very satisfying and an excellent value for the money (when you consider a concert ticket can be $90 bucks these day and this is about $20 you can't go wrong).  I gave this 5 stars not because it's perfect but it really really well done.<br />The video quality is fantastic with great shots of the band and the sound quality with a decent stereo system is excellent.  I really like the selections because they pull from a number of albums and while I initially thought that the orchestrat would mean cheezy it really adds and doesn't over do anything.<br />Given that you are some level of a fan of the group I can only imagine you not liking this for a few reasons:<br />1) If you only liked the &quot;90125&quot;  version of Yes this DVD will disappoint (i.e. No T.Rabin , only 1 song from that period and 'Owner' is not up to bar with any Rabin version)<br />2) If you are a hard core Wakeman fan you will be bummed as he is not part of this (scheduling conflicts I'm told kept him from this tour as he has TV and Radio shows in the UK)- Tom Brislin  however does an excellent job of playing the notes on the keys but keeping a his own sound.  I prefer that over cloning parts.<br />3)  If you dislike the idea of young women from an orchestra jumping up and down on stage during 'Roundabout' as if this was a remake of Beach Blanket Bingo. then don't watch that song!<br />Enjoy!

B0000683DH|5.0|A really good Star Trek episode manages to balance technological speculation with a good human story. So let's start with the speculation: &quot;What if someone was able to create a device that could transform any planet into one that supports life, but would destroy anything that was living there in the process?&quot; Then we get the story: &quot;Suppose that someone who has hated you for 15 years manages to get hold of this device and run amok?&quot; These, then, are the elements that make up The Wrath of Khan. But like so much good science fiction (and Trek), this film manages to be much more.<br />In the midst of this technological crisis, we find a restless, deskbound Admiral Kirk bumping up against middle age. He has discovered that one of his past liaisons produced an illegitimate son and his eyes are failing on him. Put Kirk's mid-life crisis aboard a starship full of young cadets, and you find our gallant hero up against something he never considered before: his own mortality. James T. Kirk is finally forced to grow up, and William Shatner does some of his best acting in this film.<br />Ricardo Montalban is also excellent as the proud, driven, and fearsome Khan Noonian Singh, a genetic superman from our(!) century. Montalban had played the character in the original series; Khan was exiled to a barren planet in that episode (&quot;The Space Seed&quot;), and has hated Kirk since then. He is fond of quoting Milton and Melville. He's not your mother's Mr. Roarke.<br />Cinematically speaking, things look a lot better in ST2 than in the first film. The Starfleet uniforms are a rich, burgundy red and look like something out of Horatio Hornblower. There are more colored lights in and around the hallways. Kirk's quarters are not nearly as austere as they were in STTMP. The lighting of the sets (which are the same) manages to make the Enterprise look more inviting and more warshiplike as well.<br />There are a couple of down sides. Kirk's son, David Marcus, is a whining preppy, right down to the sweater tied around his neck. Chekov, while promoted to first officer on another ship, is reduced to screaming again when something yucky crawls into his ear. Scotty is starting to chunk out here, though the mustache he appeared with in STTMP still looks good. Uhura is back to her old job of saying, &quot;Hailing frequencies open.&quot;<br />Oddly enough, this was my first exposure to Star Trek. I'd never seen an episode until this film. All things considered, this was a terrific introduction to the Star Trek universe.  The DVD also restores a couple of great acting moments or lines that I hadn't seen since the movie first hit the theaters. A must-own!ing preppy, right down to the sweater tied around his neck.

0451457994|2.0|Stanley Kubrick got together with Arthur C. Clarke to make &quot;the proverbial good science fiction movie,&quot; and then proceeded to sift through Clarke's works for an idea. They settled on &quot;The Sentinel&quot; and a few bits from &quot;Encounter at Dawn.&quot; Kubrick could have made Childhood's End into a film, used the same special effects budget, and made a much better movie. As it is, Clarke and Kubrick have created a massive albatross, a &quot;classic,&quot; a visual masterpiece on the screen, and one of the most boring books you're likely to read. Clarke is partially to blame, of course, since he is known for writing about big concepts and remarkable speculative technologies, not characters.<br />2001 is such a part of the culture now, I don't think I'll be blowing any secrets here by revealing plot points. But just in case you haven't seen or read 2001, you have been warned. The book (and the movie--from here on, I'll talk about the book) starts at &quot;the dawn of man,&quot; three million years ago, on the African plains. We confront our ancestors, Australopethicus, or whatever they're called. They're starving, vulnerable, and afraid. Then a strange object appears, probes them, and begins to give them ideas. The hominids begin using animal bones as weapons. The object, a black, featureless monolith, disappears, and leaves the hominids to their destiny. The book fast-forwards to our age. The movie does this really well, by using a sight-match between a bone thrown up in the air and then a space station orbiting the planet. The point being, the use of tools became the basis of human evolution.<br />We come to the present, 2001. There is regularly-scheduled traffic to the moon (courtesy of Pan Am, which has disappeared and reappeared in the real world), a space station orbiting the moon, and a complete lunar base. It's all straightforward technological speculation. However, as you read, you find two very obvious things wrong: there are no characters worth considering, and nothing much seems to be happening. The tools seem more interesting than the people. When we come to the Discovery mission, heading for Jupiter, we come across two of the flattest characters known to science fiction: David Bowman and Frank Poole. We almost welcome the presence of the schizophrenic, flat-voiced computer, HAL 9000. HAL makes things interesting by killing people. The flatness of David Bowman becomes useful once he encounters the Monolith. Then the narrative becomes nothing but descriptions of what Bowman sees. Clarke, after all, is best at describing the remarkable and the alien, not for portraying human reactions to them. So by the end, Bowman is transformed by the Monolith, and once again we are looking at another stage of human evolution. The book, anyway, is better at explaining &quot;what the ending means&quot; than the movie is. The visual feast of the movie allowed Clarke to write a successful sequel 20+ years later. The second book is the best of the lot. You might be better off just reading that one, since it summarizes much that is in 2001, and takes off from there.

B00005JN1L|3.0|By this point in his career, we as audiences have learned that Johnny Depp always picks the roles, some questionable at first glance, that interest, entertain, and delight us. After such films as \\"Edward Scissorhands\\", \\"Benny and Joon\\" and \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\", his latest project, the at times clumsy \\"Secret Window\\", showcases his unique sense of humor, characterization and personality in a performance that is the highlight of an otherwise disappointing film.<br />In \\"Secret Window\\", he stars as Mort Rainey, a neurotic writer struggling to overcome his difficult divorce and put his life back into order. Six months after falling out with his wife Amy (played by Maria Bello), he has holed up in a secluded cabin deep in the woods of Upstate New York, refusing to sign the divorce papers and suffering from a bad case of writer's block. However, one day he encounters John Shooter, a strange man from Mississippi who claims that one of Rainey's well-known stories, \\"Secret Window\\" (hence, the title) was stolen and plagiarized from him. Shooter even leaves him his manuscript, and Rainey reads it, discovering that it strikes remarkable resemblances to his own story written years before. Although he ignores Shooter's threats at first, Shooter turns out to be much more than he has bargained for, and as his threats turn into violent acts of revenge that grow in severity and meaning, Rainey must figure out how to anticipate and stop him. Not only do tensions rise between Shooter and Rainey, but also between Rainey and Amy's new boyfriend Ted (Timothy Hutton), who also begins to threaten him. <br />As I said before, the highlight of \\"Secret Window\\" is the performance by Johnny Depp. He completely absorbs the character of Mort Rainey, giving him a new depth, believability, and suprisingly, humor; something pleasant you don't see often in thriller movies. He brings a crowd-pleasing energy, and still manages to inject his signature personality in his role, which alone carries the film. Had Depp not been a part of \\"Secret Window\\" I think I would have given it a much lower rating. John Turturro, as John Shooter, gives a solid and scary performance, bringing back his familiar accent from \\"O, Brother Where Art Thou?\\". The rest of the cast is simply mediocre, which does nothing but emphasize the brilliance by Depp. <br />Although Johnny Depp makes a fine effort to save the film, it is not enough, and although \\"Secret Window\\" delivers an exciting and suspenseful hour and a half, the last and completely unnecessary twenty minutes completely degrade what credibility the script had earned. The twists and frightful gags are somewhat predictable, and although the movie promises to deliver an eye-opening climax, the actual ending leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied. In my opinion, the film could have ended twenty minutes earlier, and it would be much more chilling and impressive. <br />Although it provides a few good chilling scenes (enhanced by the eerie soundtrack by Philip Glass), the main reason to see \\"Secret Window\\" is for the performance by Depp, which, due to his humor and personality keeps this film afloat.

B00003CX5P|3.0|An older time, a different society....<br />I would like to give &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; the benefit of the doubt and say that the characters were boring because it was a more stolid age (like the Romans under the Stoics). That might make sense, because Star Wars is derived from Asimov's Foundation series, which is based on &quot;The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot; by Edward Gibbon, which is an actual history of the fall of Rome. As Rome moved from civilization to barbarism, its manners changed from being more rigid to being more passionate, chaotic, and violent. That's my &quot;good&quot; spin on Phantom Menace; and how many of you just got bored reading about Roman history? I rest my case. TPM is more like a dramatic recreation of history, like one of those Civil War reenactments. You have a general idea of what's happening or what's going to happen, and you admire the pageantry of it all, but are you really MOVED by it? It all depends on your attachment to the material, I suppose.<br />Look, we all went into this film KNOWING that Han, Luke, and Leia were not going to be there. But we expected the same sort of magic, energy, and passion, didn't we? Yet it wasn't there. Anakin is annoying. Amidala remains poised throughout. Ewan McGregor is nowhere near as interesting as Alec Guinness. The most Qui-Gonn does is smart off to his bosses. Darth Sidious just talks. Darth Maul practically DOESN'T talk. So where does that leave us? With a very beautiful, slightly long prologue to a trilogy we all loved that did not live up to its potential.<br />When I wrote the words above, Episode II had not come out yet.  My feelings for this film have changed slightly.  Compared to Attack of the Clones, The Phantom Menace is at least charming in some way.  Star Wars II is nowhere near so kind, and it lacks the worthy presence of Liam Neeson.  I can at least sit through this film again without yelling at the screen for skipping (much).  It still takes too long to build to its conclusion--too much talky-talk and not enough grab-your-lightsaber-and-go--and thus it does not live up to its original lineage.  One can always hope for better things in Episode III, but I'm not holding my breath.ild to its conclusion--too much talky-talk and not enough grab-your-lightsaber-and-go--and thus it does not live up to its original lineage.

B0001AP12G|5.0|All I have to say is this album is one of number one's of all time!!! His lyrics are astounding, and the beats kill too. You should definetley buy this joint.
B00000DGUG|5.0|After the thrashing anger of her first album, I'm sure a lot of people were expecting another round of rage against the male of the species. Fortunately, that does not seem to be the case here. Being a big fan of lyrics, I read the inner jacket and did not find them nearly as harsh or bitter as those in &quot;Jagged Little Pill.&quot; If you read them right, it almost sounds like she took a look at her first album, decided to calm down, and even laugh about it a bit.<br />As with the first album, the first four songs are the best, and only the third one (I believe) even made it to the radio. That's perhaps understandable. There's a lot of poetry here, but not a lot that's easy to categorize. It doesn't have as man &quot;catchy tunes&quot; as the first set of songs, almost ALL of which made it to the radio.<br />My favorite tracks include: &quot;Front Row,&quot; &quot;Baba&quot; (an interesting swipe at personal gurus), &quot;Are You Still Mad,&quot; &quot;Sympathetic Character,&quot; and &quot;Can't Not.&quot; I think I like these because they have the most constant, recognizable melodies. A lot of the others, either because of the nonlinear nature of the lyrics or the odd rhythms, make them hard to remember. Again, there is not nearly as much anger in this album as in Alanis' first, but there is also not as much that is as great. Four out of five stars, looking forward to the next one...
B00012QM8G|1.0|I can't believe he'd do this.  If I even thought there was still a chance that some directer's would allow a flipper, I would not have opened the package to this one, so I could have returned it.<br />One of the best movies ever though.<br />Now I have to go write him a letter insisting on a Special Edition with a $19 rebate offer for people who were suckered into this version. :(<br />Rent this one, unless you want to own a type of DVD that was phased out years ago.
B0000648WZ|5.0|If you have read Robert A. Heinlein's book, you realize that this movie is not all that it could have been. For one thing, the director decided to downplay a lot of the philosophy Heinlein included in his work. For another, despite critics' opinions to the contrary, Heinlein's world in this book was not fascist. And yet the hero of the film is a lantern-jawed Aryan superman, as are many of the rest of the cast. The \\"special forces\\" look like Gestapo agents, right down to the long, black leather topcoats (Who'd have thought Doogie Howser would go Nazi?).<br />Another crucial piece missing from the movie was Heinlein's original creation--powered armor--which he described in detail and which anim&eacute; films have copied many times since. Perhaps the director was afraid of copying the original. Who knows?<br />That said, I loved this film. It's a guy thing, I guess. This is quite possibly the most violent film I have ever seen (Under Siege 2 being the other). This stuff is GRAPHIC. You've got brains blown out, hands blown off, severings, decapitations, disembowelments--no sir, this film is not for the timid. I performed a public service on my way into the theater by telling a young mother with a three-year-old that she probably shouldn't take in her son. I had read the book, after all, and knew it wouldn't be pretty. This is a war film, don't forget. Or more properly, a war recruiting film. The director even includes a kitschy series of newsreels, which he intersperses throughout the film to show how the space war was being played to \\"the folks at home.\\"<br />All in all, I prefer the book to the film, but they are really two separate experiences. The movie is based on the novel, it is not a direct translation. If the moral of the book is, \\"The military can make a man out of you,\\" the movie's moral is, \\"Join the infantry so you, too, can kick @$$.\\" A subtle point, but one that was perhaps lost on the director. The book is about manliness, the film is about macho. If you don't know the difference, go watch the movie. If you do know and appreciate the difference, you'll appreciate the book.t know the difference, go watch the movie. If you do know and appreciate the difference, you'll appreciate the book.
0446310786|5.0|&quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; takes place in Maycomb, Alabama, during the Great Depression.  There was a lot of racism during this time and it's expressed in this book.  The Finch family includes Jean Louise, aka Scout, Jem, and Atticus.  Atticus is the father of Scout and Jem.  They're mother died when Scout was young, so Scout is quite a tomboy.  During the summer, Dill stays in town and plays with Jem and Scout.  Most of their time is occupied wondering what happens beyond the Radley's door.  The Radley's are neighbors of the Finches and are very mysterious people.  Arthur Radley, aka Boo, is the most mysterious of them all though.  None of the kids have seen him.  But that is one thing Scout, Jem, and Dill intend on changing.  During all this, Atticus is appointed to defend a black man on trial for raping Mayela Ewell.  Most of the town and county look down on Atticus for taking this case.  Jem and Scout even get bothered by this.  But through all of it, the family sticks together. <br />I highly recommend this book.  It tells a point of view that you may not have thought about before.
B000002MY3|4.0|I've heard that song writers or singers (or both) often just &quot;write characters&quot; and sing songs from those perspectives. The same could be said of fiction writers, I suppose. But when you hear an entire album full of pain, you've got to wonder. If you accept the lyrics of these songs as reflections of Alanis' actual feelings, it is utterly clear that she had a lot to get off her chest when she wrote these songs. She vents upon men who have dumped her or cheated on her and her upbringing.<br />Alanis screams a lot of her songs, and you can hear her sharp inhales, as if she were in distress while she was singing them. It is angry music from (what sounds like) an angry girl.<br />When Alanis slows down, you realize her voice is fair to middlin'. She's got a bit of a whine in her tone, which either intrigues you or makes you want to turn off the radio. I happen to be one of the intrigued.<br />One of my favorite songs is a &quot;bonus track&quot; that scared the heck out of me the first time I heard it, because it comes a full minute after the reprise of &quot;You Oughta Know.&quot; It's untitled, but is soft and sad and full of hurt. Like Fiona Apple, Alanis sounds very young to be this burned by life. But the result of all that pain--real or feigned--is a very unique, very stylistic form of music. You'd almost want to hug her after hearing this, if you weren't concerned that she'd bite your head off first. Fortunately, she mellowed out a bit on her second album.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|This is commercialized radio-ready slop that will warm the hearts of posers and nu-metal fans to no end.  This is indescribably atrocious material that's embarrassing in its simplicity and execution.  The &quot;riffs&quot; are stale and mercilessly simple and uninteresting (and horribly repetitive), whilst the singer is giggle inducing with his pathetic style.  This wretched offering will hopefully merge into obscurity given enough time.  Will appeal to fans of commercial rock radio and those who want to check out 'some heavy stuff' without feeling intimidated by what's out there.  Contemptible ditties for the poser lot.
B000056HRZ|5.0|I for one am shocked my parents let me get all the way to college before I saw this film. It is so good and so fun on so many levels that it should be with us as long as the technology exists to preserve it. There's a war going on; there's deceit; there's nationalistic flag-waving; there's heroism; and in the midst of all this, there's a love story. If ever there was a \\"chick flick for guys,\\" this is it. In addition to the war and romance, there is also sharp, sly dialogue that still amuses nearly 60 years later. Throw in some of the best talents of 1940s Hollywood and you've got that marvelous clich&eacute;, the \\"classic.\\" If World War II were to somehow disappear from the history books, yet \\"Casablanca\\" remained behind, an audience could still watch, understand, and appreciate it.<br />Who would like it? Good Lord, who wouldn't? Maybe a few Nazis; perhaps the Arab Anti-Defamation League; and the humor does occasionally angle toward the masculine viewpoint. But even so, the famously \\"tough\\" Humphrey Bogart gets to be war hero and sensitive romantic lead all in one.<br />This is the way Hollywood movies should be (and all too often are not) made.
B00005QDW5|1.0|Oh, the floyd has sunk so very low.  If you like this than I suspect you don't much care about music.  Tell me why ,please.
B00003CWMI|5.0|Fans of Isaac Asimov are undoubtedly drawn to Bicentennial Man, as very few of the Grand Master's movies were ever made into films. This is definitely a good one. Asimov was not a shoot-em-up kind of storyteller. His characters talk to each other and resolve their disputes in discussion. Commander Data from Star Trek The Next Generation owes a lot to Asimov's creations, and especially to this story, where a robot strives to become like a human being. If the story's premise strikes you as silly, it was just as silly when the story was about a wooden doll or a dead man brought to life in a laboratory.<br />Robin Williams does a commendable job in this film. Those expecting the off-the-wall smart remarks and antics that are his trademark might be disappointed. Williams played this one straight and low-key.<br />The look to this film is remarkable, too. The characters and the world it portrays are distinctly modern, affluent, upper-class. You won't find much grease or grime here, save in the roboticist's laboratory. The buildings get bigger and glossier; the vehicles lose their wheels and start levitating; the costumes get a bit more sleek; but there is nothing here that is too far out. It is a far cry from Blade Runner or Johnny Mnemonic, and is very &quot;clean.&quot; I couldn't even tell you if Disney made this, but it has the Disney feel to it; or perhaps the Disney theme park feel to it.<br />Bicentennial Man is most definitely science fiction, but it is also very different from any SF that I have seen on the screen before. Rent it, buy it, keep it for your kids. It's a keeper.
