B002NZTZ8S|5.0|It is a story of wonder and hope which children need to hear more often these days.  We bought steam train engines for our grandchildren so they can set them up under the Christmas tree and play with them in Christmas Day and New Year.  We had to add the Polar Express movie story to the gift package - as well as two &#34;train ornaments with the jingles&#34; so the grandchildren will remember the spirit of Christmas for the rest of their lives - hoping they will appreciate and remember our love for them as well.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this app can do so many things, you can choose any song or ringtone you want to wake up to and has a lot of great option. I love it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars was a metaphorical book consisting of love, humor, and cancer. I applaud John Green for one of his greatest and most touching books.
B00F522C7C|5.0|This was an absolute delight my granddaughter loved it and watches it over and over again!! Loved it and have shared it with her little friends.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|My grand son jumped up & down when he got this!!! Thanks for getting it out to me right away!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Loves it. Exceeded my expectations by far! Not a single song on the album that I feel the need to skip!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|The horrors experienced by these WWII veterans is unimaginable  to us today but E.B. Sledge has written an incredible account of their service. I wish everyone could and would read this book. One need not be a history buff to find the story compelling!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I am a confirmed &#34;treky&#34; so this was right up my alley....Loved it, and would recommend that everyone see this movie!!
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I love this watch! It's very casual. I wear it every day to school. My only complain is that I have to adjust my watch every day because it gains about two minutes every 24 hours.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Save your money, the only thing this disc has in common with Boston is the logo on the cover. So sad.
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|This movie may be a little long, yet, in order to get the story line across, it is well worth it! Just make yourself some extra time to watch the whole thing! Even so, watch it again and again! It goes the distance in what one believes in as opposed to another! Also, how our own spiritually can be healed and matured over time!
B001HN6918|5.0|One of my favorite animated films, my granddaughter and I watch it often, it is one of our very favorites!!
B00D1VKZ3M|3.0|Loved it! Escaped for the day into Brigets world! Couldn't put it down! If you have doubts because of other reviews like. I did..... But it anyway! It's worth it!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|You don't need to be a cat lover to 'get' this book. It's hysterical. Hope there's a sequel or even a dog book. Thanks Francesco for making me laugh. Oops just saw there is a dog book. I'll be getting that next!
B00C061I3K|4.0|Not what you would have expected from Daft Punk after their first few albums but after several listens you understand the exploration of times and genres and forward look toward what is to come with music.  They pull from the past and from many eclectic brands of music to create an amalgamation of sound that is really pretty enjoyable.  In 10 years, everything will sound like this.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|Although it is kind of dark, there's something fascinating about this movie that draws me back again. It's a very good character study of a woman who's stunted emotionally but clueless about it. We can see what her problem is, but she can't. Isn't that a lot like real life? Many people have trouble with relationships and end up alone. This is an intelligent movie and Charlize Theron is always fascinating to watch. Hey at least she loves her dog. :) But again, this movie is an antidote to the Hollywood movies that make us feel we should all be great at relationships and life. There are a lot of lonely people in the world and that's what this movie is about.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Absolutely love this app. Totally worth the mere buck it takes for literally hours of fun. No bugs (hehe) or glitches. If it suddenly shuts off and restarts without notice, you need a better device. There is nothing wrong with this game. Just you :-)
B000KCHZK6|4.0|Not Too Late is Norah Jones' third album. I'm not sure I would say this is my favorite by her, but it seems to be the one I've listened to the most over the last few years. It took some time to grow on me, but I ended up pretty fond of this album.<br /><br />This is very mellow music. The songs don't shake me with any sort of intense power, but they have a sort of quiet strength that starts to sneak into your heart over time. Standouts for me are the title track, Not Too Late, Rosie's Lullaby, Not My Friend, Wake Me Up, and Wish I Could. But most of the songs I'm not as into are still pretty good.<br /><br />Overall, I'd definitely recommend this album. It may not be the obvious sparkling jewel of your music collection, but it does have worth.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|Way better than expected, I expected with the cast it would be funnier but it did have a few high brow quips.  Because of how good she was in this movie, I went back and watched Jennifer Lawrence in Hunger Games and X-Men first class as well.  That girl has a huge career ahead of her.
B00GGEV828|5.0|AN EXCELLENT ACTION FILM. READ THE BOOK FIRST AND THE MOVIE IS RIGHT ON LINE. A MUST SEE FOR ALL FANS OF JRR TOLKIN.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Ok, so I got sucked into this game from my friends &amp; loved ones. I told myself I wouldn't, but.... I did. So, let's go through the con game that is candy crush saga... Ok, so the 1st 50 or so levels are a breeze, THEN, after a certain level, you only advance IF you are lucky enough to  have the right combination of candies drop... which almost never happens. OR... you buy lives &amp; &quot;boosters&quot; with real currency. Like I said before. it's a con game... pure &amp; simple... too bad I'm addicted to  this con game. But not for long. Going to candy crush rehab soon.
B00ELE8D4Q|5.0|Love Love Cher! She never disappoints. Cheers to you Diva and All your accomplishments. For those reading...Go on and buy this Cd, you know You want to! No regrets here (o;

B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Pretty good game . Wish u could use coins to buy more bricks for building kingdom . But all and all pretty good match 3 game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game, but I think Amazon needs to approve the updates faster, so that it we won't have to wait as long to get the updates.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Must read if you want to see the movie.  The book gives you all the information to make the movie just go along well.,  I liked the movie and I liked the book.  More violence in the book and descriptive fighting.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Fruit Ninja it is fun and you have to use your reflexes with out being to quick on the draw.

B009ZAY8MM|5.0|New versions of family  Christmas songs.  There voices are beautiful together as well as individually.  Look for the delux version that has the little drummer boy....it is really good.  A must have for Christmas listening.
B00EU9VCKO|1.0|I bought this for my kindle. I guess I just don't really take pictures on my kindle so it just wasn't very practical.
B00005MP58|5.0|Before A&E went down hill by only making reality television, they made excellent movies. This is no exception. Of all the versions of Pride and Prejudice I've seen, this has got to be the best. The fact that Colin Firth is in it is merely a bonus.
1451613520|4.0|&#34;There is no doubt that the United States now feels that they are the only superpower in the world and they can do what they like.&#34; - the late great Nelson Mandela<br /><br />If the late great Nelson Mandela was still alive, he would have been joining and supporting the opposition to the US war of aggression against Syria, the NSA's massive surveillance program, police brutality and the provocative attacks against Iran, China, and North Korea. The quotation of the great Madiba will be traced to the horrifying historical trending events of US imperialist aggression that started from the Wilsonian doctrine to the Iran/Syria crisis, as well as the internal crisis and repression, and it's unending support for right-wing dictators like Batista, Pinochet, Marcos, Diem, Somoza, Shah Reza, Mobutu, Park, Chiang, Botha, Trujillo, Videla, Rios Montt, Stroessner, and Duvalier  This documentary + book will give us these facts that were obscured, diverted or downplayed by the Western mainstream media. I am having plan to purchase this reading about the alternative version of the history of the US.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I remember those past days so clearly and I really enjoyed the wise sayings...  the past is obduate SaaS nd things harmonize.  I loved the book...
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Surprisingly entertaining and thought provoking read! Very well written and researched. Athough a bit fantastical, it was realistic enough to make you think a little deeper about the boundaries of privacy in today's digital world. Definitely recommend.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its alot of fun to play. I really enjoy it. I would recommend it all ages to play. Especially on these cold days.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|Lots of action and I have a choice of endings.  It's one of those movies that if I want to watch it, I have it handy.
B00A6I8EMC|1.0|Do not order the Kindle version of &#34;A Christmas Carol and other Christmas Books.&#34; I have downloaded hundreds of books to my Kindle, and this is the first one that did not translate well to an e-book medium. The print is too small to read, and the font-size adjustment does not work on this particular book, which seemed to be scanned and not formatted specifically for Kindle. I found a hardcover &#34;Christmas Carol&#34; in the library and would recommend purchasing Dickens the old-fashioned way.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|This was a birthday gift for my daughter who loves Lord of Rings and The Hobbit. She has all the hard bound books and has read them more than once. We will be going to the midnight performance for the new release next week.
B0030B811Q|2.0|A stinker, but at least mildly humorous in some of the scenes. I would give it 1 1/2 stars if I could.
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|Excited to see The Hobbit series with the statues and special features as was done with The Lord Of The Rings series! Had to buy a Blu-Ray player for this since the statues aren't being released with DVD format movies for The Hobbit, but at least there are good deals for Blu-Ray players on Amazon.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I cannot describe how I felt when I read this book. I knew it was going to be a sad book before I ever read it, but I wasn't prepared for how this book affected me. I have read many books in my short time on earth and I can really tell when a book is excellent.<br /> This is the first book that ever made me cry. That's right, I cried. Heck I cried in public because I really did not care what anyone thought. I really got THAT connected to this story.<br /> Now I'm not trying to depress you and scare you away from reading this book because you really must read this book! It's beautifully written and the characters are truly amazing. I loved them all. This book brought out the worst and the best in me and I hope many others enjoy it the way I did.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is a Christmas gift and I know we will all LOVE it ! We own all of the 5 other seasons and can't enough! This is a must for the avid BBTfan!
B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincoln is a very good movie.<br />And being a Speilberg  film .<br />tThe transfer is excellent too<br />If you buy this film.You won't be disappointed
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I'm always ready for something &#34;Star Treky&#34;. I hoped I wouldn't be disappointed...I wasn't!<br />They did a great job capturing the flavor of the characters from the original series, and before long it was easy to view the new Captain James T. Kirk as &#34;Jim&#34;. Get it, you'll want to watch it more than once for sure!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Hmmm.. I really am not sure what to think. I have had so many emotions go through me since finishing this book. I'll start off with saying that I really did enjoy it as well as the entire series, although, the first was by far my favorite.<br />Like every other person, I was really wanting tris and tobias to be together forever, but I suppose the author was trying to show us things don't always go as planned.<br /> While I am not satisfied with the ending, it was a pretty good book. Lots of action, violence, and tris/tobias relationship struggles. It's worth a read if you're already devoted to the series.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|I am soooooo addicted to this game!!! My husband has to take what ever device away from me that I'm playing it on. Beware you will become addicted as well!!
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I am a fan of this DVD concert release.<br />For a long time I hoped for it to go Blu-<br />When it did I bought it.<br />The A/V presentation is much better then any thing DVD can deliver.<br />If you love the Eagles as much as me.<br />You can't go wrong by upgrading to this
B0064MGU98|4.0|Getting a late start with a show that has been highly rated by friends and have only watched 1 and 2 of the first season, but it is compelling enough for me to continue.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This was always my favorite carnival game in my teens. I could play for hours if the money held that is. I still will throw coins in when I take my kid 's some place that has a machine. This game brings back all those wonderful memories.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy when candy crush was added to kindle. I am on level 440 &amp; that's the last level kindle has added. Please update asap &amp; add the lates levels.

B001HN6918|5.0|Jack makes this movie funny and happy for all who hear him...  He shares surprizes to all and makes the watchers laugh and have a great time watching him
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie is full of adventure and I would recommend it to anyone!  For the price of Amazon Prime you can't beat it!
0884271153|5.0|this is a must read for anyone looking for a good business book - mba course was written up around this book. Def must read!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is another excellent film.<br />The A/V presentation is equally as good as the film.<br />Thanks to Mr Steven Speilbergh
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|wow this is unbelievably scary and suspencful i love it but at times i really was nervous and mostly scared for the little boy that was going to get hit by a train
0345803507|5.0|This is a captivating trilogy! The readers's interest is seized from beginning to end. I enjoyed this immensely and recommend it to anyone looking for intrigue.
B00GH4R95C|2.0|It was ridiculous.  Superman and Zod wrecked Metropolis, but the final scene showed Clark Kent going to work at the Daily Planet.  I did not see Lois Lane or Jimmy Olsen.  Perry White was Larry Fishburne.
B008AT71WI|5.0|This is another movie I ha on DVD.<br />And I am very satisfied all the way around<br />the picture/the sound /the supplements.<br />All excellent.
B0072GPQ72|1.0|Loud and extremely violent...........certainly not a family type film.  It may be a guy 's night out video but not for anyone else.<br />I think Spielberg is great but this is NOT one of them.
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|It was brutal, it was kind, telling the life of an amazing man without mincing words. A good solid read without soppy padding.<br />Interesting to see how his mind worked and his life evolved, highly recommended for any Mac buff ...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While this is a great last book for the series, it isn't as good as the other two. It feels long for the build up, but the climax seems very short.
B008MU8ZOI|5.0|Had this film on DVD.<br />And when it came to Blu-<br />I had to buy it in that format.<br />The A/V presentation is excellent.<br />And all of the special features from the DVD were carried over.<br />Thanks Sony pictures
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game. Time bombs are the pits really and a big rip off but this game is very addictive! Love it!
B00BXI0IHS|4.0|Her writing of all things horticultural entwined around an unusual family tale was cleverly crafted. The only thing that let the book down was the numerous rushes into the cupboard, kinda took the edge off it. Having said that, her obviously love of life in miniture and finite detail was spell binding.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Books one and two we excellent reads. Third was good, not great, but tied things up well. Overall, highly recommend!
B008JEJPSC|5.0|I always loved the film Annie.<br />And I am so happy to have it on Blu-Ray.<br />A real joy to watch.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|really very fun never played it till my husband downloaded it to my kindle now I'm hooked<br />lots of fun to play
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a riveting vision of desolation, despair, courage and hope that Mr Howey has brought to life. Excellent writing and imagination.
B00GNAO796|5.0|This was a GREAT movie! I absolutely love it! Chloe Grace Moretz was a great Carrie. I am definitely buying this the day it comes out on DVD/Blu Ray. This movie is Carrie for this generation. Most of you might think \\"This is just going to another stupid horror remake.\\" But it really isn't. After I saw the movie, I read the book, and this version of the movie is more related to the book the 1970's version and the 2002 version (Not 100% sure when the first remake came out). If you love Stephen King and horror movies then you will definitely love this. I know this movie got bashed in reviews by the critics, but the critics also look for The Godfather in movies, when it comes to this movie, do NOT listen to the critics. This movie is WAY better then both of the previous versions of the book. I HIGHLY recommend this movie! Most people know what the story of Carrie is so I'll give it a brief description. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Carrie,a 17-18 year old high school student who is tormented by her classmates,along with a VERY religious mother. As the movie goes along,Carrie finds about her new found telekinetic powers known as telekinesis. In the beginning of the movie, Carrie has her period and doesn't know what it is cause her mother never told her about it. She starts bleeding from the area and she thinks she's bleeding to death. She then tries to go to her classmates for help but all they do is laugh and start a chant \\"Plug it up\\", telling her to plug up the area with a tampon. Then throughout the movie, one of her classmates Sue Snell , who was in the chant starts to feel really bad for what she did, but another classmate Chris Hargensen , is not so forgiving. Chris then starts getting in trouble for what she did to Carrie, but she doesn't think she did anything wrong. Chris then gets suspended and not allowed to go to prom. While on the other hand Carrie is learning about her powers. Sue then asks her boyfriend Tommy Ross to take Carrie to prom cause of how bad she feels for what they did in the locker room. Tommy then asks Carrie to prom and Carrie agrees. To get \\"revenge\\",Chris and her boyfriend Billy Nolan decide to go to a farm, kill a pig then drain the blood. While at the prom, Carrie and Tommy get elected prom king and queen. While Carrie and Tommy are on the stage Chris and Billy dump the bucket of pigs blood on to Carrie, then the bucket falls, hits Tommy in the head, killing him. Carrie then wreaks havoc on the school and kills multiple of her classmates. Hoped this review helped and hope you watch Carrie, you will NOT be disappointed!!!!
B009A87ZKG|5.0|the Blu-Ray version to buy.<br />This excellent classic was needlessly DNR'ed.<br />The grain structure of the film is much finer the 35mm.<br />Because it was shot on 70mm film.<br />So if you are a film fan.<br />Don't fall for the nicer packaging that the other BD release of this film has.<br />Because to film fans this one has the proper transfer.!!<br />The sound quality is excellent too
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Was this the most anticipated sequel (which it turned out not strictly being) of the last decade? Probably. Was there any chance of it living up to these expectations? Probably not. However, this doesn't mean it is a failure, as it is far from it. It is a sprawling, flawed thrill ride that seems more about some attempts at explanations while setting up its sequel. A strong cast, a genius director and wonderful cinematography make it well worth your time. Just don't expect it to be a masterpiece. Really a three and a half star film rather than a four.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|For the first I was able to print off my Kindle Fire.  I am a happy camper.  I often wondered if there was a way to print until I happened across this app.
0545615402|5.0|These were bought as a gift for me, and I couldn't have been happier to receive it! As a loyal Harry Potter fan, it was great to fall a little bit deeper in the world of Hogwarts to learn more. This is PERFECT for any Harry Potter fan. The books and case are made exceptionally well for such a low price! I would highly recommend it to anyone questioning purchasing this.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is a great book - in some ways I was reminded of the movie Forest Gump while reading this. As with Forest Gump, the narrative of the book  spans the life of one person - in this case an old man over 100 years. It puts him in many situations in the middle of many historic events, and where he unbeknownst to himself plays a pivotal role in changing the outcome of history.<br /><br />It was interesting to read this book and then take side trips though the Internet and explore the events and characters he encounters. I think I actually improved my knowledge of contemporary history!<br /><br />It is also instructive in how the author manages his craft, weaving a story where characters have multiple purposes, and no evildoer goes unpunished, yet the innocent or naive mostly find their lot in life improved after an encounter with our protagonist.<br /><br />It was slow reading, I took a bit longer than usual to finish this book, not only because I kept dwelling off in Internet searches (thanks to Kindle that is easy enough to do), but also I found I needed time to &#34;digest&#34; the book.<br /><br />Currently I'm trying to get my teenager to read this, but no luck yet.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|If you're like me, you gave up on Tom Cruise a while a of, when his off camera nut bag antics overshadowed anything he might be doing on film, which wasn't great anyway. And I tried the Reacher novels without falling in love with them. So this seems a strange combination for me to be interested in. We'll, writer director Chis McQuarrie was the attraction. And he doesn't disappoint. The action, humour and drama and a great combination and Reacher proves to be a great cinematic creation by Cruise. Who would have thought that. If you'd like to see your hero with a bit more of an any man quality than Bond, perhaps Reacher's your man. Enjoy the ride.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|BEST GAME EVER<br /><br />I will certainly be buying this for my pc. But this way I can have it with me at all times. Best two bucks ever.
B00FGGD9PG|1.0|I loved this movie. I love disney animation. So when I bought this book for my kindle app for my IPad 2, I was very disappointed. The graphics were cut off and some pages were blank. The quality is its representation is extremely lacking. I feel cheated.
B00BAXFECK|3.0|The story for me is a bit to depressing.  I am going to finish it but it is taking some time.
B005S9ELY4|3.0|Have you ever gone into a movie with expectations swollen due to the cast, director and subject matter only to be left wondering how the sum of all this parts don't quite add up? Yep, me too. Gangster Squad is the classic example. There is nothing terribly wrong with the movie. The issue is it really just doesn't go anywhere, which is a complete waste of all the expectations and talent it has. Entertaining enough, just not great.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Best app ever. The connection between the mobile app and consolidate  is a great idea. Everybody purchase this game or you will regret it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read, the author paints such a perfect picture have no problem visualizing the story. Really feels like you're there with the characters! Can't wait to read the next book!
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|It is working well and with no power adapter, so I have less mess behind my Mac.  I only hope it continues to work well.
B005NFJAT4|3.0|If you like your stories overwrought, preachy and patriotic as hell, this is the movie for you. If you're after any sort of subtly maybe give this one a miss. Good, but by no means great.
0143124838|5.0|I really loved this book! There's even super pretty photos in it, and tons of fashion advice from Alex. She also shares facts about her that I never knew!
B001XVCYH2|1.0|I would like nothing better to just pretend this movie never happened. And that's all I have to say about that.
B00DXP7L88|2.0|Spoilers.<br /><br />I was very disappointed with the final season. Weak writing. The brain surgeon was a bore. The reveal that Harry had someone else come with the code and she was the mother of the brain surgeon was down right silly. Deb's death was anti-climatic and a diss to her character. Her burial at sea was a joke. Dexter abandons his son with a serial poisoner to raise was laughable. It's like the writers were throwing mud at the wall to see what stuck (a young Dexter protege, Masuka's daughter, and on and on). All were useless, undeveloped plot lines that went nowhere.<br /><br />Dexter as a lumberjack after boating into a hurricane was the final insult.<br /><br />The final season is one star, I rated two as an homage for the previous excellent seasons.<br /><br />Dexter can join Seinfeld and The Sopranos as having terrible series finales.
B00F30S0Y0|3.0|I must start by saying I'm a huge Arcade Fire fan. Love every album up to now, so was awaiting this release with just a bit of anticipation. Having now listen to it my reaction is &#34;well, what was that all about and could I have been doing something else instead&#34;. Arcade Fire are clearly looking to mix their sound up and this is a very different album, but in doing so have produced a pretty boring piece of music. While trying to stretch them selves, it just feels like they couldn't quite push themselves enough or didn't fully embrace it, so it all sounds a bit halfhearted. Still a fan, but can't see myself putting this one on high rotation.
B005T87QCI|3.0|I wasted my coins thinking that I will get 250 but I did not.  I am not saying the game is bad but a should get my coins
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is super fun and very addicting!! :)<br />I can stop playing it its one of my favorite apps I recommend it to everybody.
B00BWQW73E|3.0|This was a fairly readable business book about the creation and the early development of Amazon.com.<br />To a certain extent, it filled out some of the gaps in my understanding about how the idea for the original on-line bookselling business was conceived, financed and launched.  It also offered some biographical information about Jeff Bezos which I did not know and found interesting.<br />Unfortunately, that is about all the book did for me and a lot of it was, for me, fairly dull reading which required a certain amount of patience to get through and offered little understanding of the nature of the problems Bezos and his colleagues must have faced or how they dealt with them.  Many of these problems were referred to, but it seemed to me they were dealt with very summarily and I got little insight from their descriptions.  There were too many names referenced and there was too little substance associated with any of them except, perhaps, Bezos himself.  It was a veritable river of people moving through the organization and not much sense of what they were actually doing, what difference it made and why they were leaving (when they did).  Especially after the business began its very rapid growth and began to move into a multitude of new areas, I was unable to understand (in an overall way) what was really going on and I had no idea how Bezos was able to understand it (although I am firmly convinced that he did).<br />That is a criticism I suppose I make of most business books (and most biographies for that matter).  They are full of facts, names and dates but seem to me to provide very little understanding about the nature of the problems that are being described or the actions that are taken.<br />As a long-term Amazon shareholder, I am very interested in this company and even fascinated by it.  I want to know more about it, but to date the only really interesting information I seem to be able to find about it comes from the annual Letter to Shareholders from JeffBezos, himself.

076115728X|5.0|Great book -- tons of fun to explore, and with a great message. Good for kids (or adults, for that matter) of any age.
B005JZBP8W|5.0|What's not to like, and Blu-ray makes it even more wonderful. Everything works to make this classic a wonderful view to keep.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Is not compatable with very many apps. Tried to stream Amazon Prime movies and they would not work. Very limited use. Also wish it was Blue Tooth capable so it could be use when WiFi is not available to play movies that are on my ipad. Returned the one I purchased for myself and the one I purchased as a Christmas gift.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This is by far the best match 3 game I have played. Upon the first getting and playing game I immediately bought the full version.  Happily awaiting the next game to come out
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|This was a great MOVIE!!! I really enjoyed it and it was a well written MOVIE for the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary. Its good too see Tennant comeback and see how him and Smith work together. The addition of John Hurt is great.<br /><br />Its a great MOVIE!!<br /><br />Now to the quick point that really angers, and I mean ANGERS me on here about the customers. THIS WAS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE AN EPISODE!!! THIS WAS CONSIDERED TO BE A MOVIE!!!!<br /><br />So please, stop complaining about the episode being 7.99 to download. Just go and buy the disc then. DON'T PIRATE IT EITHER!! Its not price gouging either. I'm pretty sure some of the feature films may be 4.99 or 5.99 to download. This is the price that it is because its considered to be a SPECIAL MOVIE for Doctor Who. Not a special episode. Thats what the Christmas Special is.<br /><br />The other thing I don't like is that I don't think people realize that they bring the overall rating of the movie down when they rate it a 1 Star. At least give the film the proper rating you know it deserves and then grip about the price if you must but I think the price is a good and reasonable price for it.
B000VYX8PE|3.0|This is a very silly, and thus funny, book.  My granddaughter (11) has read about nine of them and loves them.  So I got her the remaining ones for her Nook, to read on a long holiday trip.  There is nothing moving or great or Newbery-worthy about the books, so don't expect too much.  But they are humorously absurd, so I can see how an 11-year old would like them.
B000W23H8S|5.0|The cream of the 80's music....The period when we came out of the haze of disco....A new sound came into focus...Regatta de blanc....White reggae....Rock, funk and just plain good music...With Melody...They wrote some timeless classics that will live on....but isn't that what Good music is...
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Riptide GP is old But Gold. I have played this on my Samsung Galaxy Tablet several years back when it was first introduced on Google play. I am happy to see that Amazon App store now has this listed compatible with my Kindle Fire. This game has a sequel [[ASIN:B00EEL0LGY Riptide GP2]] which is even more graphics intensive. For making this game work as smoothly as possible you may have to tweak graphics settings to low quality on certain low end devices and it can provide you realistic water based physics and racing.<br /><br />This game truly deserves five stars! [[ASIN:B00EEL0LGY Riptide GP2]] is even better but needs high end tablet to play with full quality graphics.
B00459EZLW|5.0|It took season one to get used to the new format but by the 3rd episode we were hooked. Wish some one had told us not to watch SGU period because by the time you start getting it they cancelled the show which leaves a  bad taste  for those of us hardcore SG fans
B00FATEJYE|1.0|When I tried to download it, it kept on restarting and reloading for a week! Don't download it! It's a waste of my time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fabulous story and sets!!!  It clearly shows the separation of the classes yet the respect for each.  I highly recommend you watch it all, starting first with season 1.
B00EEL0LGY|4.0|After seeing [[ASIN:B006GKHE6G Riptide GP]] being offered as FREE APP of the day It prompted me to take a look at this game [[ASIN:B00EEL0LGY Riptide GP2]] and I was pleasantly surprised to see it being offered at a discount rate. I picked it up for my Kindle Fire. I have played both Riptide series on my Samsung Galaxy tablets before when it was sold on Google play and I thoroughly enjoyed them.<br /><br />This game is little too taxing on certain low end tablets as the graphics are very intense. Certain low end devices suffer frame-rate especially if you enable high resolution and other details. If the game jitters try to lower the resolution in the graphic settings and you will find it playable on most tablets.<br /><br />The only reason why I rate this 4 stars instead of 5 is because certain stunts are impossible to perform and some levels cannot be completed.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice sequel to [[ASIN:B006GKHE6G Riptide GP]] and deserves a 4 star rating.
B00006AW63|3.0|dvd does not work.  States &#34;DVD not in this region&#34; when it goes to play, so unable to view this movie
0553208845|5.0|Siddhartha came to my attention through a friend as well as though the Yes album &#34;Close to the Edge&#34;. As one reviewer stated, this is a good I could read again in the future on different occasions and discover new elements of the story each time. Those that view this book as a &#34;story about Buddhism&#34; are missing out on one of the more profound works of the twentieth century.<br /><br />It would be inaccurate to call Siddhartha a coming of age story. More accurately, it is a spiritual awakening that happens over the course of a lifetime. Siddhartha rejects a life of privilege to find a deep meeting. But even when he encounters the living incarnate, he looks for something beyond. Believing he is above the folly of the modern world, he leave his life of solitude. But when the vice of the world troubles his soul, he is brought to the edge of a river. Coming full circle, Siddhartha is seeks the peace that cannot be taught at this river.<br /><br />Siddhartha is poetic, yet written in plain text. The emotions of the central character are easy to feel as he cycles through turmoil in search of resolution. It would be challenging to read this book without being effected.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is the best game in the whole entire world. Every single day I jump on this game and play. My brother and I always follow the bananas. Our highest scores are 133,532 and 96,345 minion rush rocks!
B00EEXST2K|4.0|The porn was great, and the movie even had a little plot.  Don't watch the movie for its plot, watch it for Amanda.
B0030Y11XS|4.0|Still appropriate even though this is not a new DVD.  You can become discouraged after watching it.  You don't have to be liberal to see the problems.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Truly a must watch for any human being. This film was not only highly informative, shocking, and extremely well put together but also even entertaining. If this film doesn't make you feel a sense of responsibility and inspire you to be accountable regarding the choices we all make, nothing will. The takeaway is, we all have the ability to impact our world, whether positive or negative, its up to you.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Can really appreciate concept of &#34;restorative niches&#34; and empowering introverts to be successful with their personalities. Refreshing take on shyness.
B00005LOUP|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Jim Carey but I love this movie.  Based on the animated one I watched as a child, this is true to form except for a few added twists.  My kids love this and laugh their way through it every time.
B00C5R7B0I|4.0|love the scarpetta series  she becomes like your family as you get to know the characters of the stories  can,t wait for the next  exciting episode....
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|I couldn't get past the pilots drinking and taking drugs, which...if anything like real life...makes flying frightening.  I didn't get more than 30 minutes into this movie before turning it off.
B00DGN51O8|5.0|Loved this movie.  Definitely for feudal medieval fans, loaded with action, adventure, suspense and surprise!  Very interesting back story of how giants came to be.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Britney Spears does it again with her eighth studio album Britney Jean. This album is full of infectious dance hits, that will have you wanting more. Such artists like will.i.am, David Guetta, William Orbit, TI, and Sia helped her out on this record. Britney's sister even does a song with her on the album. You can't listen to this only once. Be prepared Britney fans, she's back!
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|It good, but as a sequel to &#34;the shining&#34; not good enough. It is in my opinion entirely predictable.The girl's character is well described, the adults seem kind of flat.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is a really interesting movie.  A team of scientists travels to deep space in search of the origins of an alien presence on earth, only to discover and awaken a sleeping giant which they must then defeat, all with the help of a robot that...although beheaded during one battle, continues to guide and direct the successful conclusion.  Interesting special effects add to the solid acting and plot.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|LOVED them on The Sing Off.  Love them still.  Wish that show was still on tv...these guys were some of the best of the best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this game knowing it was going to be good. Minecraft lets you build anything you want in creative mode and tests your skills in survival mode. The only thing that disappointed me was Mojang stopped their servers. so no multiplayer.
B00FQPHA0M|5.0|Great movie and Henry Cavill is amazing as Superman! I really enjoyed this movie and will watch it again and again!
B00EVW0VTI|5.0|Wow!  It just doesn't get any better than discovering that the bad seeds are all inside the pod.  A story of corruption and take-over and revenge that takes viewers to new heights of never-ending political scandal and the fight to save not just a president, but a country.  If you want exciting, gripping, edge-of-your-seat action with truly bad bad-guys, you will not be disappointed in this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|That's very cool game with lots things from cartoon. And its totally free. Thanks a lot for days and nights with minions!!! Even my daughter likes it though she s two n cannot play she just watch me playing like watching cartoon.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book will keep you engrossed! You will not want to put it down! It is truly extremely well written!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I have the kindle fire hd 8.9. The graphics are AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!.  This has by far the best graphic I have ever seen.  This is also a very fun game to play.  Get this while it's the FAOTD.<br /><br />No Wi-fi required
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|11 years and this is it? First off, I'm a huge Boston fan. Been there from the phenomenal debut to the abysmal \\"Corporate America.\\" I've been excited about this album since I learned it was going to be released, but, given the poor \\"Corporate America,\\" I knew it was possible that it would be a disappointment. The fact Brad Delp had passed away and was only included on some of the tracks was also a cause for concern.<br /><br />Well, I'm disappointed. In fact, I'm kind of disgusted, to be honest. First off, drum machine. Seriously? Tom Scholz, did you listen to anyone who complained about this on \\"Walk On\\" and \\"Corporate America?\\" What legitimate rock band uses a drum machine? The programmed beats are annoying, repetitious and very thin sounding.<br /><br />Second, the mix is terrible. This is shocking given the amount of time Scholz apparently took to \\"hone\\" the album. By far it is the worst mix of any Boston album. Vocals are buried in overlayered guitars and the aforementioned drum programming. The whole album sounds muddy, sloppy, and, surprisingly given Scholz long-standing \\"no synths\\" mantra, computer generated. Unforgivable for an album that took 11 years.<br /><br />Third, three songs from \\"Corporate America.\\" Tom, 11 years on and you're rehashing songs from an album that few people liked in the first place? The re-recorded \\"Someone\\" and \\"You Gave Up on Love\\" are at least justifiable. But \\"Didn't Mean to Fall in Love\\" is the same exact tune simply lifted from \\"Corporate America.\\" \\"Someone\\" features Delp on lead vocals which are the same as on \\"Corporate America,\\" unfortunately it's marred by the newer terrible sounding drug programming and the crummy mix. It was a good song to start with and remains a good track. \\"You Gave Up On Love (2.0)\\" now has Dahme sharing lead vocals with Tommy Decarlo and Tom Scholz. Also a good track. Unfortunately, I don't see the point of including either. So you basically get 8 new tunes. 11 years, 8 songs. Oh, and one of them isa wholly unimpressive instrumental.<br /><br />So, what about those new tracks. The strongest song on the album is the opener, \\"Heaven on Earth.\\" It's a great classic Boston sounding tune. The one new track to feature Brad Delp is \\"Sail On.\\" It's not a bad track and it is great to hear Brad, but it is oddly structured and ends in an abrupt manner. It somehow feels unfinished. \\"If You Were In Love\\" with Kimberly Dahme on lead vocals is one of the better tracks, despite the fact there has been much grinding and gnashing of teeth among fans about the fact Boston has a woman on lead vocal. Personally, I don't have a problem with it and this is a good track. Tommy DeCarlo leads on \\"Life, Love & Hope\\" and \\"Someday.\\" Both are uptempo and what I would classify as \\"ok\\" tracks. In addition to playing all the instruments, Scholz takes over lead vocal on \\"Love Got Away.\\" It's actually not a bad tune, and I don't think Scholz is as terrible on lead as some do. The album closes with a strong track wrecked by the terrible mix.  \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\"<br />has DeCarlo back on lead and doing a fine job, but as I said, the mix is awful. David Victor is buried on the harmonies and the whole track sounds muddy and like it's a demo.<br /><br />I'm guessing this is the last Boston album and it's a sad thought. I've loved these guys through and including \\"Third Stage.\\" But every album since the debut has been a step backward. Admittedly, I don't know how you'd top \\"Boston,\\" so that was ok for a while. But the last three albums have been quite disappointing and this is the most disappointing yet. I'm very tempted to give it 2 stars and I wish Amazon had 2.5 stars. There's less than a half hour of new music here. The drums are perhaps the worst I've ever heard by a major artist on a track which wasn't a demo and the production is by far the worst of any Boston album .
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Idk which was better the first or second one but i cant wait to read the final one. Its such a romantic story with all sorts of twist and turns to keep u guessing.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book captivated me from page one to the end.  It awoken my inner spirit and sexuality.  It allowed me to understand the psyche of an abused person and the workings of an abusive relationship, none of which I was previously familiar.  There are so many undercurrents in this book and such an unexpected, deep, philosophical work.
B0087GF8ZG|3.0|Lights up perfect every time but Velcro it came with doesn't stay on back. It falls.fixed that myself. Light is bright.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|this is not just another race game, the graphics and controls set it apart from the rest. Definitely worth the price, but glad it was a free app of the day!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is not timed and makes you think about your next move and its critical to use you're brain and each move could be your Kady if you decide wrong, sucks that you only have so many lives then you have to wait... but overall fun and a good way to test how well you can plan out your moves.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|Very interesting happenings during the year. the events and the people are fully explained and the history of why it happened and what took place afterward. Very good reading.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I downloaded the sample of this book and was hooked almost immediately. I am a big fan of heroic fantasy, especially if there's a coming of age element involved, and this book offers just that. Looking forward to reading on!
006202406X|2.0|Words cannot describe how extremely disappointed I am in this whole book. The author just throws away everything she built up in the first two book and tries to write a completely different story. The story is full of plot holes, unanswered questions, and a completely unnecessary and heartbreaking ending. It makes me wish I had never started reading the series in the first place. The first two books were so good, and the rest of the story had so much potential. But Veronica Roth blew it on this one.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love this movie and can't wait to see the sequel in theaters. I know I'm late with finally watching this but it was worth the wait.
B00CNQ7CRI|5.0|I read this book despite knowing that spoiler alert 😁 Mark is gone but despite that I felt what Bridget was feeling the loss of the man she loved and not having him be with their kids missing out on them growing up. But it had as usual Bridget getting herself in the most embarrassing predicaments which was great to read. The book was bittersweet and I love the way it ended.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is great really fun to play at anytime the graphics are very realistic i enjoy playing this every time
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderfully written story. I couldn't stop reading it. It made me think how life is fragile and childhood family ties make a huge impact on who we become as adults,
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun but only two levels. You can't earn anything. You have to buy the other levels. But the two free levels are nice.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|As always, Bill Bryson covers his chosen topic with a great deal of humor and insight.  I had no idea that 1927 was such a pivotal (and amusing) year...
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|The luminaries ... I could sense the writers brain whirring away as she holds the pattern of events with a very assured lightness . It's an absorbing read on lots of levels . I enjoyed the detail of life and all the distinct personalities and intrigue . I would love to see the series as a Sunday night theatre  .
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So excited to finely get to have this as an Amazon app. I have been waiting and love playing. :) :)
B005KP7EO0|4.0|WONDERFUL TO SEE SAM SHEPPARD AGAIN....  HE JUST BRINGS THAT INIMITABLE STRENGTH OF CHARACTER TO A MOVIE... RATHER SUBTLE, RATHER HUMOROUS, RATHER UNAFFECTED.  AND SUCH A NATURAL ACTOR.... YOU BELIEVE HE IS BUTCH CASSIDY.... AND I LOVE THE FACT IT EXPLAINS THAT BUTCH LIVED BEYOND THE TIME HE WAS THOUGHT TO HAVE DIED IN BOLIVIA WITH SUNDANCE; AND HOW SUNDANCE DIED WITH A COMPASSIONATE BULLET TO THE HEAD FROM BUTCH HIMSELF.<br /><br />IN SHORT, THE STORY HAS A BELIEVABLE EDGE, AND SHEPPARD'S PERFORMANCE LENDS WEIGHT TO THAT.  THE FELLOW WHO PLAYS THE ACCOUNTANT-GONE-BAD IS LIKABLE AND BELIEVABLE AS WELL.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app if you haven't played you should really try it.  Niamh is my BFF. love love love.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|AMAZING 3D game that works extremely fluidly on the KFHD ....absolutely no problems so far and was lucky to get it as free app  of the day
B008JFUUIA|5.0|It's like Glee meets Van Wilder ;)  Fun college acapella competition. Great music, cute story. Great cast. Very funny movie.
B00G3P6VA4|3.0|I thought it would be a lot better but it was watchable and I enjoyed some parts.  Great movies are hard to come by these days,
B00G3DA5XA|2.0|I attended the press screening for this movie with high hopes since it was being so closely compared to Perks of Being a Wallflower, which I absolutely adored. Sadly, despite very strong performances from the lead actors, this lacked the heart and sensitive charm of Wallflower, so much so that the collective reaction from the audience at the end of the movie was a: &#34;What? That's it?&#34;<br /><br />This film was also so obviously written by young men with no idea of how to write women (the two writers even filmed a brief 2-minute intro, in which they practically begged everyone to like their movie - real professional, guys) . There are two scenes/lines in particular that I had to roll my eyes at - I won't spoil the scenes, but the first in which Sutter's mom yells &#34;Sutter! Again?&#34; at a sight at which no mom would ever tolerate just once, let alone multiple times; and second, in which Aimee tells Sutter: &#34;Let's just forget it and never talk about it again&#34; which pretty much left me enraged. Aimee's utter lack of self-respect throughout the whole story was very off-putting and sad to watch. Any girl in their right mind would woman up and break it off with such an insufferable and sorry creature, instead of get sucked into his booze-fueled downward spiral. I also found it a bit hilarious that Aimee only suffers a broken arm during one particularly violent scene - but again, it's another example of oversimplified and pat writing.<br /><br />As to the main character of Sutter, it was hard to empathize with him. Yes, it's sad he inherited the disease from his father, but he does very little to actually overcome it or make himself a better man. There's no redemption for the grief he causes Aimee, and just when it's hinted he MIGHT make amends, you get a sloppy and unsatisfying finale. I kind of hoped Aimee would tell Sutter to off himself before fading to black.<br /><br />This is not a romantic movie by any means and should not be marketed as such. Ifthere's a genre for &#34;first love utterly wasted on the wrong person&#34; then this is that, hands-down.
B007EE564U|5.0|An extremely likeable assassin, a perfect fix for a thriller, mystery, intrigue addict. The characters are expertly introduced and developed.
B00G3Q6VPS|5.0|Every song is mastered to perfection. Any true Britney Spears fan should add this album to their collection. Love, love, love it!
B00DW36G32|5.0|Two terrific actors doing their jobs well. Enjoyed the plot and the performances of the stars. Well done movie with a fast-moving pace with lots of excitement.
B00A7W29BE|4.0|I'm not totally familiar with this app yet, but I can see the possibilities. For now, 4 stars; later, probably 5 stars.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Nice game. It's similar to other games I have played. There's something about games with bubbles. I will invite friends. Nice
B009F7OQ5Y|4.0|Bought this for my 5 year old niece for her birthday.  Well made dress and traditionally pretty.  Very appropriate for her age and she loved it.  She thought this Barbie was beautiful.
B000W022XG|5.0|Amaizing record!! I think Dummy by Portishead is flawless, in my honest opinion this is one of the records you must listen to before you die. The only way that I can describe it, it's  a Dark Artistic industrial bluesy jazz  journey. The band has a killer sound the album flows great and it just takes you to another place super rad album.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is a riveting classic. I can't believe I waited so long to read it. Amazing how Hugo can describe souls in torment.
B004132HZS|5.0|this show is brilliant. the acting is great. the writing is excellent. the execution of the show is down really well. so much awesomeness. be prepared for an hour and a half episode. 3 episodes per season. so worth the time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. It's the perfect time waster. It may be your typical match three game but the objectives to advance to the next stage make it both challenging and fun all the same time. I've been waiting for this to released on Kindle for a long time and was so happy to finally see it.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|Killer album by an extreamly promising band Imagion Dragons knock it out with night visions.  The album is so awesome the mix of styles they bring the hooks and just the positive energy from this album is insane really great listen.
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|Love the added footage.  Some was obvious why it was cut, but a few scenes added to the story.  One even made me say, &#34;so that's what was going on with the elves.&#34;  I probably didn't &lt;i>need&lt;/i> the 3D version.  My 42&#34; screen is good, but home 3D always lets me down.  I'd take away half a star if I could.  Why, you ask?  Why could the extended edition be part of the initial release?
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|i love star trek. nuff said. so my review is very simple. i just need to keep typing to pass the guidlines.
0553582011|5.0|It took him long enough, but now I have the paperback to add to my bookshelf.  Hopefully the next book will not take so long in coming.
0399157573|5.0|This book has been greatly needed for my collection. It came in record time, showing up at my door a day early. It was packed well and in perfect shape!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|First of all, i would classify myself as a mild sci-fi and fantasy fan.  I truly enjoyed this book and especially enjoyed all of the pop-culture references.  Most notably the 80's music, movies and TV!  Really fun book, A+!!!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like this game except it takes a long time or loss of money to get the cool stuff. It plays pretty easily though.
B00005Q45W|5.0|In 2001, after a nine year hiatus,  Leonard Cohen was out with his next studio album, &#34;Ten New Songs&#34; . Produced by Cohen's longtime backing vocalist Sharon Robinson &#34;Ten New Songs&#34; is a beautiful album marked by strong songs in simple but very effective arrangements. Cohen's vocals are familiar, deep and almost in a whispering , though you may feel that they have lost some of their earlier strenght .<br /><br />Sharon Robinson is co-writer on all the songs , and being responsible for all the music, apart from a little electric guitar provided by Bob Metzger, and the very beautiful vocal harmonies, this is very much also Robinson’s album, and she is logically depicted on the cover.<br /><br />Most songs are slow and lingering, full of atmosphere and most have an amazing ability to grow on you every time you listen to them. Several have become concert favorites, such as &#34;In My Secret Life&#34;, &#34;Boogie Street&#34; and &#34;That Do not Make It Junk&#34;.<br /><br />I had the pleasure of experiencing Cohen and Robinson during the 2009 tour, where especially &#34;In My Secret Life&#34; was a highlight on the long set-list. Among other favorites is the haunting &#34;By the Rivers Dark&#34;, which in addition to a fine melody has a great lift in the chorus. &#34;Alexandra Leaving&#34; is one of the musically more complex tunes, and very much an example of a song that can grow on you. Also the melodic final number &#34;Land of Plenty &#34; helps making &#34;Ten New Songs&#34; one of Cohen's most successful albums.
B008VEA1C4|4.0|We got a copy that says that it is a rental copy and does not have any of the special features like the other short movies on it.  I don't see it mentioned with this listing so I think the seller didn't realize it was a rental.  We bought it for the movie and not the special features though so we are still happy with it.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|this was one story I could really relate too--I love flowers and referred to the end of the book often to look up flower meanings.
0553801473|5.0|What can I say? All the George R R Martin books are terrific and this is why they were made into the TV epic Game of Thrones.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best stories I have read in a long time, and I read a lot of good books. The author did a great job building characters and settings, without spiraling into tangents. As a reader, I was able to feel connected...going through a roller coaster of emotions as the main character lived life and in spite of the odds, found love and friendship. She even found bits of pleasure during times of depression and war. Although this is a story written from the perspective of death, it is really a story about choosing to live life.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|My Favorite Movie of all time. Great acting, great story. The plot never gives away it's next surprise. Great Movie!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I cannot get enough of this series!  I love carving out &#34;me&#34; time to indulge in the stunning surroundings of Downton Abbey.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was even better than the movie! Both a must read and watch! I have yet to read the sequel, &#34;Catching Fire&#34;.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I'd say it was a pretty good read, considering it was all stories from random survivors. No pure time to watch the movie.
B00C5XBAOA|1.0|My almost 3-year-old daughter just received these as a gift, without the castle, which is sold separately.  The figures will not stand up on their own.  If you need the castle to make them stand, it should not be sold separately.  My daughter was creeped out by Roland and James because she thought that they each only had one leg.  So right off the bat we had to &#34;put them away and maybe Daddy can play with them.&#34;  Then, because Amber wouldn't stand, she tried to bend her to sit.  And she popped Amber's head off.  From the look of horror on her face, I think she thought she killed her.  I popped the head back on for her, but that was it.  She wouldn't go near them and was very upset until I hid them and told her I got rid of them.  Sofia the First had been her favorite cartoon.  And now she won't watch it anymore.  Thanks a bunch Mattel.
B00FAI3JE6|5.0|think it by far time for her to see it too. I always felt that this movie was one of Tom Hank's break out roles (IMHO) and he did such an amazing job at portraying himself as a big kid that you can see the child in him from the first moment that he starts and the scene in the toy store with the giant piano has to be one of my favorite that has stuck with me since I was young. The quality on this was great and I loved the additional special features provided on this. I especially enjoyed the Hollywood backstories and the deleted scenes. All-in-all this was a great movie that everyone should see and experience!<br /><br />*I received this for review -all opinions are my own*
0740748475|4.0|The only thing wrong with it is the weak binding.  It is the nicest looking set (maybe the only set?) that there is, but I do soooo wish that the binding weren't to notably poor.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Verdict is still out. Works ok with hubby's laptop but so far I have not been able to connect it to my  LG Showtime Optimus phone. Some info online says it will do android, other info says no. I am disappointed about the enclosed directions, not a lot of info or any troubleshooting advise. The booklet is about 1&#34; wide by 2&#34; tall and maybe 6 pages. Will review again in a few months.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Great TV series.  It seemed like one long horror movie,  and not a TV show.  It had great plot twists, yet still scary and suspenseful.  I would recommend this for any horror movie fan!
B003EVWDR0|5.0|James Cameron's film Avatar not only entertains, but also brings up an important theme relating to evolution.  The film focuses on a fictional planet where the native Na'Vi are being invaded by humans.  While the humans in the film do not view the Na'Vi as equals, Cameron does portray them in a way that invites comparison between the two species.  While the humans are technologically superior, the Na'Vi have the physical advantage.  Furthermore, the Na'Vi have evolved into a point where they can live in perfect harmony with the environment, while the humans merely want to exploit it for their own gain.  This contrast between the Na'Vi and the humans shows what Cameron believes is several flaws that humans have.  This contrast shows that in fact the Na'Vi are more evolved than humans, and this leads to a conflict that is compelling and interesting.
B004UID2LC|5.0|You Tube is a fun site but it also has excellent presentations on &#34;How To&#34;, medications and business. It works so well with the Kindle Fire and can be a great means of entertainment when you are stuck waiting for something.
B000FC13MM|3.0|Sadly to say, this is not a book for all ages. I found the world to be less detailed and visceral than I would have liked. Furthermore, the dialogue, at best, felt choppy and directed. This book, like it's targeted audience is underdeveloped, and depending on how it is raised, could change for better or worse. Nonetheless, this is no doubt a book for teens.
0312935579|5.0|Bradford tells us the epic story of woman’s climb from servant to the head of a business that spans several continents. From the owner of a small shop in a village to one of the most successful retail storeowners in the world, Emma Harte does it all. However achieving such success does not come without its cuts and bruises of which Emma could claim many.<br />Bradford gives us the lifetime span of a woman with a keen business sense and not always so keen relationship sense. You have to love Bradford’s heroic women. A moving and entertaining read.
B000000YG4|5.0|Album was in perfect shape. The fidelity and performance is incredible. After listening to Sonny Rollins &#34;Way Out West&#34; album, (1957)  I just had to get &#34;Saxophone Colossus&#34;(1956), one of Sonnys' most acclaimed albums . This was recommended by a jazz aficionado - friend of mine. Quite pleased with this !
B001XUT6AG|5.0|The movies got progressively better after the first one, and we enjoyed seeing this one again.<br /><br />Regarding Amazon, the download was good, and there was never a change quality or a stop in the stream.  Good job, Amazon!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second installment in the Hunger Games trilogy definitely did not disappoint.  A spellbinding adventure that keeps the reader on the edge of their seats!  A must read for all lovers of action packed fiction novels.
B008220BLG|4.0|I like this movie because it's not so gory and that it has a combintation of both romance and comedy never before seen in a zombie movie for the first time ever which makes it appealing to anyoune who watches this movie. Though I think that a couple of the delete sceneces like R and Julie on Plane Floor and the other is R with kids to maybe make the movie longer but it's also good the way it is.
B0060ANOXY|5.0|I was quite surprised by this album= it is an incredible recording !  Honestly, I hadn't realized that Roger Walters, a bass player and vocalist for Pink Floyd, was so much of the creative force behind  &#34;Dark Side of the Moon&#34; and &#34;The Wall&#34;.  The album is quite a statement on war and man's foolish addiction to entertainment. Beyond the artistry of the musician, the recording itself is a landmark, much acclaimed by audiophiles and studio engineers.  Mixed using audio techniques by &#34;Q Sound&#34;, the affects and localization of sounds are downright spooky, even by Pink Floyd standards; dogs barking out the door to my far right, a gorilla flipping TV channels in the woods behind my left shoulder, a choir drifting beyond the wall behind my speakers..... W.O.W.  I can't say enough about this &#34;discovery&#34;. (Where have I been all these years?) .  Buy this CD --- you will love it and listen to it over and over again.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|***See update at the end of this review***<br /><br />Simply put this is a fantastic little stove and worth every penny. I used it for the first time outdoors at an elevation of about 3,800 feet in 34 degree F weather with cold isopropyl alcohol for fuel and it boiled an .8 liter potful of water in about 12 minutes after the alcohol started to burn properly. This little marvel is compact, well-built and very functional. Everything that comes with it plus a thin pan squeegee and a box of matches, is easily packed into the pot, with the inverted frying pan acting as a well fitting clip-on lid. And when packed everything fits tightly so nothing rattles. I was pleasantly surprised at how well that funny looking pot holder worked and how stable this stove was, no wobbles at all even with a full pot of water sitting on top. It's simple to use, consumes very little fuel and is very efficient. In a slight breeze a wind screen is a must and I think something like a magnesium fire starter or a swedish fire steel might make lighting it in cold weather a lot easier. I also use Trangia's .5 liter fuel bottle which is equally well-designed and functional.<br /><br />UPDATE: I've used my Trangia extensively over the past 4 months with isopropyl alcohol, here are some pearls of wisdom and more information. 1). My little Trangia sips fuel like a miser, this must be the greenest stove there is! 2). If you're in a rush the Trangia is probably not for you. It's certainly not as fast to boil water as a propane or other gas stove. 3). To light the stove quicker in cold weather, keep the fuel warm by storing it overnight inside your sleeping bag. 4).The best tool for lighting the Trangia is one of those long wand-like fireplace butane lighters. 5).Definitely use the Trangia with a windscreen, it makes a huge difference.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|Great animations with smooth gameplay make this a must get. The visuals are very striking for an apply game. Fantastic!
B00G922EA2|4.0|Decent.  A few storyline holes.  Strange ending.  Challenging play.  I love  no hidden item searches.  Mini games mainly easy.  Not a lot of back and forthing.  Just didn't like the abrupt ending.
0765325950|5.0|Finally the end of the saga is here!  I found the battles of a grand scale, and the final confrontation between Rand and the Dark One was not only awesome but thematically inspiring.  Sanderson did a good job!
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|great movie, highly recommend!! A must watch for one who knows what it's like to love someone with an addiction!
B00EK0UBPU|3.0|“The Luminaries”<br /><br />Without the aura of the Booker prize I would never have read through the 600 pages.<br />It was also a mixed bag. There were some interesting accounts of personality and action.<br />It was fluent.<br />However it did not have chronological sequence. It had maze of events that I simply lost track of as I read it.<br />The astrology was sheer puffery to me.<br />I thought the author must have had a phenomenal mastery of events not to have contradictions.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|My husband and I feel the same way on our house lol. Its why we love this movie so much!
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I have a kindle fire and have no problems with the controls like some are saying, I find the controls easy to use smoothly and the graphics are great. Somewhat comparable to Hydro Thunder for the x box in the palm of your hand. This is a great, fun game with different levels of difficulty and a good selection of racing levels.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It is a tear jerkier, have a box of Kleenex at hand, I can only watch it maybe once a year.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app does exactly what it's supposed to. A few bell and whistles but not enough to detract from the functionality.
0688156819|5.0|wonderfully cute and strange in only the way Tim Burton can deliver.  Not the biggest book, but that is very forgivable.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I was bored one night when I came upon this game. I love playing this game. Time flies by fast
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Though Amazon lists this app as compatible with a Kindle Fire it does not work with the non-HD version since there is no speaker on a regular Kindle.  My son downloaded it and was very disappointed that most features would not work.
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|The picture was like watching on rabbit ears. Horrible lines, squiggles and smudge. But the movie was great.  It's a definate LOL, laugh until you pee your pants
B008JFURKG|4.0|I liked the first film. This one is just as action-packed. It has a great cast, and is never boring.
1452126577|3.0|My brother and I are fans of the Grumpy Cat postings often seen on social networking sites.  However, when I bought this book as a gift for my brother, he said it was disappointing.  He said the social media posts are much more delightful and this book was just blah for the most part.  He preferred the funnies I print out from the internet versus the entire book.  That says a lot.  I am disappointed that the book did not live up to what we see on FB.  Maybe they ran out of material.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|A great way to just relax. The new challenge of finding 'bapples' is awesome and I love how a reward is given that you can use besides bananas. If I had to pick one downside to the game it would be the difficulty of earning coins.
B007ZYJT1U|4.0|I want to give this 5 starts, and I might in a month or two once the movie has 'worn off'. This movie is dark.  DARK. D-A-R-K. If you want a movie with great acting and that does not follow the typical Hollywood formula, this is for you - just be sure you don't need to be happy for a little while after it.<br /><br />I found the way they tied the name of the movie into the story to be my favorite part.  You have to get past the 1st scene where he kills his dog in a drunken rage.  It is brutal, and I literally snuggled my dog for a good 10 minutes seeing that (think Clockwork Orange opener).<br /><br />Give this movie a chance, you won't be disappointed.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so very much fun because it is very fun  and I enjoy playing it and my high score 12000000
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Great read!  Don't miss this extraordinary account of President Lincoln and his inspiration to the cabinet members and the entire country.
B008EKOO46|4.0|Jared Diamond is a heavy hitter in the world of anthropology and human geography, with much of his fame resting on his bestselling, wonderful book Guns, Germs and Steel. Now, at the age of 75, he has assembled a mass of information about many different &#34;traditional&#34; societies -- consisting mainly of small populations grouped into clans and tribes, and supporting themselves as hunter-gatherers, herders and small-scale farmers -- and tried to glean some lessons for those of us living in urbanized, modern states. The societies he cites cover every continent but Europe, with a particular focus on the area the author knows best, which is New Guinea. It's a wide-ranging work, covering warfare, dispute resolution, child-raising, nutrition, religion, multilingualism and much more besides. Of necessity, he has to make value judgements about all of this, trying to sift what he thinks may be of value in the cultural ways of people whose lives are so far removed from ours as to be wildly exotic.<br /><br />To be sure, there are some matters about which Diamond thinks traditional societies have little to teach us, such as warfare. In general, societies with very weak centralized authority have extreme difficulty extricating themselves from a state of perpetual warfare with their neighbors, especially if resources are scarce. They become locked in cycles of bloody revenge, and no one seems able to stop it, because no one has the power to compel the rest of the tribe to lay down arms. The death toll in proportion to the size of the population can be much higher even than the modern countries suffering the worst losses in the 20th century, such as Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union. Tribal societies such as those of New Guinea became much more peaceful when the Dutch and Australians arrived to impose a measure of law and order.<br /><br />In other cultural areas, there is much more to learn. Take dispute resolution. Diamond tells the story of a young boy who was accidentally killed by a man driving a commercial vehicle. No one disputed that it was an accident and that the driver was not at fault, tragic though the accident was. Still, it was taken as a matter of course that representatives of the driver and of the boy's family would quickly meet, within days, and seek resolution. The driver (and his company) agreed to pay &#34;sorry money&#34; to try to compensate the boy's family, and also participated in the funeral to mend some of the emotional wounds. By contrast, when the formal justice system got involved in the case as well, the authorities took the license away from the driver, causing him to lose his job. Correcting this injustice then took something over two years, at tremendous financial cost, and with no resulting benefit to anyone, least of all to the blameless driver or the family of the dead boy. Traditional justice in cases like this may have much to teach more modern societies about the role of mediation, of emotional reconciliation, of compensation -- and about the value of swift justice.<br /><br />One of the longer chapters deals with child-raising. The contrast here between the traditional approach and the Western one is dramatic. Infants are nursed for at least the first two years of life, are cared by many hands in addition to the parents (aunts, uncles, grandparents, neighbors...), are picked up whenever they cry, sleep with their parents, and generally receive huge amounts of physical and social contact. Very young children, once weaned, are then given much more freedom that most Western parents would dream of allowing. The children roam widely (often in the company of older children), are allowed to learn from painful experience (even to the point of getting burned by campfires), and practice forms of play that typically involve imitating their elders (fighting, cooking...). At a young age, well before adolescence, they generally become socially competent, adept at many adult skills, comfortable in their physical environment, and very self-confident. No child is lonely, none spends his childhood in a darkened room hunched over a video game console, none is helpless to navigate his own environment, and none arrives at the threshold of adulthood with little idea of how to survive without his parents.<br /><br />Much of this approach to child-raising would not be possible in a Western urban environment, filled with the dangers of speeding cars, the risks of anonymous neighborhoods, and the time pressures of two-income couples, but there is much to be learned here.<br /><br />Diamond's book doesn't contain any of the major conceptual breakthroughs of Guns, Germs and Steel, but it is a fascinating book just the same. The insights are smaller, the theme is less ambitious, but I found it a satisfying read.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|I love this movie, it brings me back when i was younger. and the dvd is great- and many people should<br />see it if they are not.. it is warm and happy and you wander about angels and god. where they are in<br />your life. thanks kris

0316236535|5.0|My child has learning disabilities, but she absolutely gravitates to this book, she turns the pages and reads along with it. This book seems to have helped us achieve some milestones with my child.
B0022CY8WK|5.0|The music, the movie, Chicago is great any way you serve it!  Richard Gere has risen in my estimation because of the movie - I didn't know he was more than just a pretty face before I saw Chicago.  And the soundtrack is fabulous!

B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham is an excellent modern mystery writer, and Sycamore Row is right up there with his best.  The surprise ending seems to come out of nowhere, a bit confusing, but the book is a really good read.
B00E3BK0QQ|4.0|I think these games are great except for the short trail of the game and then the cost. But if you need to kill an hour or two the free version is cool
0553801473|5.0|Great quality hardcover. Love the series!!! I had purchased the mass market 4 back earlier this year so I snagged this to complete the collection as the only hardcover. Worth the extra money!
B000FA5STS|5.0|On the move, constant action, I enjoy these two characters and their interaction a lot.  One of the top authors.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|This is probably a good chess game, but how can I tell - I am not good at this game, and use this for practice.  Maybe I'll win one someday.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I hadn't heard of these books, Which is bad, because I am a writer myself.  I finally went to the bookstore, after seeing the preview of the movie before -Ironically- The Hunger Games: Catching fire.  Did a hap-hazard search for Divergent, heard good things, so I went out to buy them.  Found out it was a series, and all three books were already out.. AWESOME.. I don't have to wait forever for the writer to finish writing, like with Harry Potter, or Twilight.  I bought them, and went home ravenous to read it, although I am dyslexic and I usually take my time reading, because of the headaches I get.<br /><br />Well, I loved the first book, picked it up on 12/4/13, got through it in one day.  Started the second book the next day, and although it was a bit more angsty, I still devour it. Falling in love with Tobias, and with Tris, loving their intimate moments, their fights, and their growth. Of course it was a cliff hanger, and I immediately picked up the third book. and Just finished it about an hour ago on 12/6/13 at 8 pm. Yes I stayed up all night to read the second and third book in just under two days.<br /><br />I am exhausted, Confused, Heartbroken, and Disillusioned, as I see many other people who read this are.  I did go and read the writers blog about why she did what she did at the end of the book, and I find it still pointless, appalling, shock-value garbage, even with her &#34;I took the story where it lead me&#34; crap.  I have teenage girls who love to read and I don't think I will ever recommend to them that they read it.  Teenage years and young adulthood is angsty and hard enough to navigate without our fiction writers doing things like this to us.  I know not every story has a happy ending, (but they are my personal favorite) pointlessly sad ones just sour the whole reading experience for YA fiction readers. (IMHO)<br /><br />I understand, from writing my own novels, that sometimes there are things that have to happen in story that surprise even thewriter.  And yes, a little bit of angst can go along way to win a teenage heart, and help the reader identify with your protagonist, but I don't believe that Kids and adults who read YA fantasy romance type novels read them just to have their heart ripped out, for no parent reason after devoting themselves to reading, and investing themselves in the characters like YA genera readers often do.<br /><br />I read in one review, by a high school librarian, that she was a big fan of the series, and recommended it to her young readers often, but after reading Allegiant, She could no longer in good conscience recommend the series to them.  She was still willing to give Roth a chance to explain herself, and went to a signing, so she could express her concerns, and ask Roth about her motivation for such a pointlessly tragic ending.  Roth, very arrogantly told her that if the ending upset her so much, maybe she should go get some ice cream to help herself to feel better. I don't feel like any author, no matter how upset they are about their bad reviews, should lash out at a fan who is just expressing concern, and asking for a reasonable explanation.  It's bad form, insensitive, and just shows how immature her decision to kill of a beloved character like Tris really was. Did she really think that people weren't going to be upset, that they weren't going to want to know why? And that her saying something like &#34;Their my characters, and I'll do what I want&#34; (like a child throwing a tantrum for not getting their way) was going to make her disillusioned fans be just okay with it all?<br /><br />Didn't like this book, and I agree with all of the thing that most reviewers say about the issues in the plot line, and character dissection that happens in Allegiant. Bad bad form Roth!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|What wonderfully drawn characters and rich narrative. I would recommend this book to all high school and up. Not appropriate for kids under that, in my opinion.
B000ASATYO|5.0|I had this movie in vhs. loved it so much I had to replace it in DVD. It is a fun and exciting movie. You will not be disappointed in it. Michael J Fox is fantastic in it. It is as much fun to watch as Back to the Future.
0767919408|5.0|Great history lesson from the year my mom was born.  I had read a previous book by this author who is originally from Des Moines, Iowa, but this book really makes history fun.  Hard to believe so many things happened in 1927!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|This great movie was super engaging and thought-provoking and kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|Candice Knight is wonderful.  She sets the bar high for pagan craftsmen and women.  She's perfect.  Set the tone for your next party.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|A great insight into a brilliant, complex, creative, and sometimes troubled mind. This book really helps understand what makes Pete tick. His blatant honesty is refreshing.
B001KT6JPA|1.0|It's a terrible theme and terrible movie.  I can't think a worse movie except for all those evil horror shows which this fits into the same thing.  Let's destroy people by eating them. Yuck!

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love it ! I found it very enjoyable. You really should try ! It is something great to play at your own pace .
B00DVPN30A|5.0|This may be Amos Lees best album.  Before I bought the album I saw a YouTube of Amos singing &#34;Chill in the Air&#34; and I fell in love with that song.  The words are so soulful and heartbreaking that they chilled me to the bone. After buying the album I read that the song titled &#34;Loretta&#34; was written in honor of Lee's mother, who is battling breast cancer.  This article made me listen more carefully to the words of this song also- and it has become another favorite. Gut wrenching honesty in so many of the cuts on this album!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragon vale is awesome and fun you can breed epic dragon like Sun rainbow moon gemstones Dragons it is very good and crazy fun
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|This video was extremely good.  After hearing from numerous people that this film brought to light some of the biggest tragedies of SeaWorld, I finally broke down and watched it.  Seeing the history behind Tilikum's captivity, I never want to visit another SeaWorld park.  What they do to these animals (not to mention what they tell the public about the deaths of the trainers) is awful.  Simply inhumane.
B00BEK6Z7M|3.0|Just not as good as the previous Pendergast stories. Didn't have the suspense level that I'm use to for a Preston and Child novel.

B0067RQYNW|1.0|I installed this app but it typed funny with high lited the correct n spelling as errors and not easy to make correction.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Although the book was totally great it was a little slower then the first 3 books.  This was OK because he introduced some new characters
B00G3Q6VPS|4.0|its a different sound for britney, its different from most of her other albums and im not sure that i like the new songs all that much.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was urged to read the book by a friend who had read it years ago and then saw the recent movie adaptation. He considered it important to read a book of this magnitude before letting a film color your perceptions of it. Bless him, he was right.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Truly magnificent.
0316055433|1.0|This book is in need of a Savior, both literally and figuratively.  I managed to finish the book<br />Because I so wanted redemption and transformation for Theo. Instead your left with philosophical<br />Hopelessness.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|I have now read this trilogy twice.  I am not sure what caused me to pick it back up the second time, but I couldn't be happier that I did.  This is a story that contains everything I feel a book/series should be: humor, despair, love, hate, ignorance, brilliance, and all the other dualities of the world that could possibly be thrown into a single story.  I recommend this series to each and every one of you with complete and utter adoration for Brandon Sanderson's ability to write a truly epic story.  I always finish good books with a hunger for more to read, but this time I feel completely fulfilled.  It has become my favorite story that I have ever read.  I hope you find as much enjoyment from it as I have... Twice (and probably many more)
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|This game has good graphics and easy controls to use. Watch the video to see what I'm talking about I would recommend this game
0761169253|3.0|This should be marketed to high school and junior high students, and people who have not studied art but want to create art. It should not be recommended to people who are working professionals and need inspiration or even a kick in the pants. I like the premise and the illustrations.
030746363X|1.0|Was a bit dissapointed with this book. The useful content could have been summed up in two chapters. Most of this book has lots of information that really had me lost and really didn't move me to want to read beyond half.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This is really a good movie. We ordered it to see it in 3D and was very impressed. Felt like I was sitting in the boat!!! Good Stuff!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great novel by one of my favorite story tellers. He always manages to make you feel like you are right there in the moment.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting and story lines. I love the characters and even though at times I was very sad, happy or angry it really drew me in. I can't wait for Season 4 to start.
B005LHO274|5.0|I am new with smart phones,  but I am having a great time with this app. The more I learn about it, the more I really like it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|My husband and I both love this game. However, he wants to play all day.  Great game. It will be a family game time.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Great game, but we should be able to earn more instead of pay cash. I don't mind making purchases but this would be too many!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|THIS BOOK KEPT ME GUESSING ALL THE WAY AS TO JUST HOW IT WOULD END. ONE OF GRISHAMS  VERY BEST.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|This one of my favorite CD to listen to, hey drake pease help KANYE with his music, anyway ive played this CD countless times!!!
0451197879|5.0|I admit it, I love the Bachman books.<br />Roadwork and Rage (both written under the pen name Bachman, ostensibly to not muddle them together with the more non-specific horror and supernatural tales) both show that King could easily have been another great American novelist, rather than the &#34;king of horror&#34;.<br />This tale is both sweet, suspenseful, touching and multi-layered.<br />Somehow King perfectly captures the mind of a psychotic alcoholic losing control.<br />Without any of the trappings of the supernatural and horro-genre, the novel has great characters and great dialogues.<br />OK, so it doesn't have the gravitas of The Dead Zone, but as a story of human behaviour and the darker side of working class life this novel transcends so much of Kings recent work.<br /><br />People are divided here. If you love the horror tales, this book is not for you.<br /><br />If however, you like a great story and enjoy, say, Saul Bellow, Richard Yates, etc, this book will be a rewarding read.<br /><br />I wish King wrote more &#34;regular&#34; novels. But I guess that train is gone.<br />Even so, a great proof of King's talent and a reminder of what could have been.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the fact that the game has unpredictable levels.  It might cycle but there are a lot of different ones between cycles.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|. It's .Awesome app. Very realistic. My 4yr old loves this game. It's like having her very own horse. I very much recommend it to ppl.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|This is epwithout a doubt the worse KANYE west cd I've ever heard, he lost his touch period? Go back to the lab bra!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|As a Jack Reacher fan, I found this lived up to my expectations completely. I was able to pick it up and drop it but still keep up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is awesome, but it needs some more things...<br /><br />-enderman<br />-different types of planks<br />-redstone should have a use<br />-it should add skins, texture packs, and maps<br />-more mob spawner eggs<br />-ender dimension<br />-ghast<br />-zombie pigman<br />And finally...<br /><br />Backround music!!! I always loved minecraft backround music but in pocket edition there is no songs!!!<br /><br />Anyway mojang should those things i listed!
B00CNQ7CRI|2.0|I just couldn't get through it. It was hard to care about the characters, who seemed to have been created silly on purpose. I know that others apparently liked it, but it wasn't for me.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|If you don't like Bruno mars, you are from mars, easy one of the best singers to grace the music industry, great great great CD!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|LOVE this game!  So glad I decided to download it. Can't wait for more levels. Hopefully they will be available soon.
B00G70WLJA|3.0|I am a wolverine fan but I found this movie slow and predictable. It took me two sittings to watch it. I just lost interest in it half way through and decided to finish it the following day. The special effects were first rate but I am to the point that special effects alone will not make a movie good. I really enjoyed the first Wolverine movie. I was surprised to hear from some friends that they did not like it. I typically will watch a movie like this 2 or 3 times over the course of several years. I doubt I will ever watch this movie again.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin Timberlake has no doubt the most explosive music ever, he never put out bad music, he just keep its coming on and on!!!
B000002ADT|5.0|This is my second copy of Kind of Blue. It is a classic album. Jazz is meant to make you think.  Inspire creativity and express the artist emotions. This is one of my favorite Miles Davis's pieces I have heard.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|A great read, particularly for someone who served at that time.  Brought back many memories, (pleasant and otherwise) and was helpful looking at the experience decades later.  Led to a greater understanding and perspective of an event that changed nations.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|I only wish I saw it in 3D.<br />This movie kept me at the edge of my seat.  I loved the plot references.<br />I'm a movie buff, not a doctor!
B005OYKI1I|5.0|I very much loved the movie. Very well made movie. I watched it in memory of Paul Walker. So so sad of him passing away.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Classic Grisham!! I'm re-reading a lot of older John Grisham books and enjoying just as much as the first time!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|great console game, good mobile game to accompany it the fighting is simple and very easy to understand good app for on the go when you have a hankering to play some injustice
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Fun to play but definitely worth the cost to buy the normal version simply because there are a million ads that pop up all the time.  Yes, I understand that's how they can offer it for free.
B000089RV6|5.0|Every track on this album is at least very good...no weak links like most albums that are purchased just for one or two good songs.  If I had to pick one album (from any artist) to bring to a deserted island, it would be this one.
B00881VLCE|5.0|My husband likes puzzles so I found this app. He loves it. Every night after dinner he plays until one puzzle is complete.
B00DQAM5LI|4.0|Give it at least a couple of listens.  You may not like it that much the first listen-through.  but the more you listen the more you'll love it.
B0018O4YSQ|2.0|Can't figure out the reason for all the good reviews.  Film is actually quite dull.<br /><br />Looks good on Blu-ray, though.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I laughed so hard. One of my favorites read for this year. Cant wait for more from this author.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Disk one is great to listen to in any occasions especially when driving.  Disk two is awesome for studying/background music.  Songs are well-composed, catchy, with full symphony, and I just love the mood of this album.
0920668372|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  Is it really for mommy or for baby?<br /><br />Such a touching book, and a happy (sad) story.
B005XUC398|4.0|This is a really solid drama. I thought this was possibly going to be a sensationalized or over-the-top story about Wall Street excesses, but it really wasn't. There were some really well known names (such as Spacey and Moore) and some newer or perhaps lesser known names, but they all did very well in their roles, regardless of their background in Hollywood. What I particularly liked about the film was how it explored the brutal, bottom line aspects of the finance and securities business as well as the humanity of many of the characters (no matter how despicably some were portrayed). It definitely isn't a feelgood film, but it is a film that will make you think--and one that will likely entertain you.
B003ZW0N2K|4.0|Overall, a good comeback with the original line-up. I could without the contemporary sounding songs but I applaud them for being open-minded to current music. OMD had always been a little experimental leaders, now they are followers. I'm cool with that.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This novel is a spiritual journey as well as a page-turning adventure story.  It's beautifully written; Martel's prose reads like poetry.  This is a truly beautiful novel that makes the reader think about the interconnectedness of all of nature as well as the nature of God.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Finished watching this whole season in just a few days!<br />Every episode made me want to watch it non-stop. Can't wait for<br />January 5 to start Season 4...I miss these characters
0812973992|5.0|Beautiful, beautiful book.  The writing pulls you in. The words read like music. And the interweaving of the stories is masterful. Anyone interested in beautiful, poignant, human writing needs to read this modern masterpiece.
B001F12J48|1.0|Not what I expected. Not true 3d. It came with 4 cardboard 3d glasses that did not work on our 3d TV. First disc was not very good 3d either with our own 3d glasses. Very disappointed.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|Really liked the movie! Much better than I ever expected... This is a movie I originally wrote off, but when I rented it and loved it, I had to buy it for my collection.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|One of the best shows around. Not for those with weak stomachs, it is often a violent and bloody show, but it's full of action, adventure and suspense.
B0017SWSCW|3.0|The author being British uses terms that may be common in the UK but in the US, unless you are familiar with these terms, can make the reading confusing.  The story line is good and I would otherwise rate this book higher if it wasn't for this one problem.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|beautiful cinematography and just a good clean scary movie very glad to own it,. Had to add it to my collection.
B00129H7VS|5.0|What a wonderful read. Honest and informative. Couldn't stop watching, had to watch several episodes at a time.  Will definately watch again and again
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is a simple to learn, difficult to master tower defense game. Features cute graphics, and all types of stuff to do.  This game is highly addictive, and well worth the price.  Not a fan of IAP games in general, but this one can be played without paying if your patient.  This game is like video crack, I Jones for it when I am at work,  and get wait to get my &amp;#34;bloons&amp;#34; fix..  Must have if you dig tower defense games. :-)
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is amazing and super fun. Ever since it was on the iPad I have waited for it on the kindle.
B00C74SHRK|5.0|Incredible characters infused with life - it felt like reading a story about a best friend - seeing the pictures behind the words was an extraordinary experience - I believed this book as it was happening.
B002KJX4IE|5.0|Fun, crazy, classic movie. The special effects are so cool and timeless.  Tim burton is creative and a great storyteller.
B0088TG252|5.0|. I thought it would be a silly action movie but it is not. Predictable in some ways? Yes but a smart movie none the less. Gritty and bloody action scenes too.
0871404133|5.0|I learned that altruism as an instinct as strong as any other. Altruism is strong enough to form social bonds amongst others including symbiotic others.
B00DNB9RXO|3.0|If you get motion sickness easily, this game is not for you.  I thought I would give it a try because the reviews were so great, and it looked like a very creative and unique game.  Very soon after starting, I realized it just wasn't for me.  I gave it three stars because I am sure it is good for people who have stomachs to handle the constant motion changes. :/
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie was just OK, If you read the book ahead of viewing the movie, you could follow it. If I had not read the book 1st, I would have found it to be pretty uninspired. Katniss was portrayed as confused, lost, and uninspired. In the book she was the narrator, and you could see the depth of her character(as well as Peeta's). In the movie they were so shallow and a mere shell of who they were in the book. All in all, the movie wasn't very good.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I know in some circles there is hate on about this movie,. but I truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />They managed to keep a lot of what made the last movie in the franchise work, which isn't always a sure thing when talking about a sequel (which even though this is movie 11 in the franchise this essentially is).  The interpersonal relationships that made the last one enjoyable really carry through to this movie.  It has the same sense of humor and pokes fun of itself just like the the last movie.<br /><br />Even though I am a huge fan of &#34;The Wrath of Khan&#34;, the essential revisiting of that story, didn't bug me so much.  This is a new universe and part of the fun of that is revisiting some of the great moments with a new spin.  Cumberbatch was excellent as Khan.  His nearly dead gaze at most situation was very well done and he managed to pull off a good balance between menacing and psychopath.<br /><br />My only real complaint was near the end.  They managed to spin the Khan story well enough up to this point to make the story feel unique, and then they went and hit the major notes from Star Trek II with very little revision.  I get what Abrams was trying to do, but it just didn't work for me.  It felt to gimmicky.<br /><br />That being said, I still really enjoyed watching this movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love that I can get my books on my phone and tablet and that is syncs with where I am at with my reading.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Another Game You Can`t put down. The pulsing clock really adds to the drama. Love it! Another keeper! Great buy at free!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very fun game, a little more complicated and challenging than the regular jewels game. Each phase leads to a more difficult one, but you can return to previous phases and play them again as well. We like it very much.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|One of the best no-nonsense pitch book I've ever read. It might feel uncomfortable at first but if you stick with what you learn in the book and add your own personality to the techniques, you will be able to pitch anything.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Movies was great. I thought this bond flick was better that the 1st and 2nd movie Craig starred in. Thanks.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love mostly All of these, but some deserved a higher rating than the other, due to the usefulness of it an resourcefulness of it.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I first loved Flynn's Robin Hood in 1938 as a child and even bought this version. It is the best action movie ever made.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|These movies are awesome.  Shipping was just as good. No problems at all.  I can't wait to get the next season when I can afford them
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was very interesting and peculiar. Very different than what I had first thought about the book. great read!
B003DS3GC0|4.0|had great actors and good story line. Kevin Bacon played an evil person so well that it made you hate him as well as what he stood for.
0345529057|5.0|Shipping excellent, Books excellent.  I only wish I had got the set with all the books that have been released instead of just the first 4. A+
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game should come with a warning label  &quot;HIGHLY ADDICTIVE&quot;!  Can be frustrating at time, but you can't stop playing.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|It was a good book - very suspenseful - up until the end. The suspense fizzled too soon at the end of the book and made for a very anticlimactic read.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this games ok.no games perfect.but I give it five stars cause really they need more games like this.this was fun.especially the kindle fire.I'm glad they have this game.but we need more and better games like this
B009C7JS14|4.0|This app is easy to use. The display enabled me to see the weather for for the week allowing me to prepare accordingly.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|The first fewlevels are easy and you can zip trough them quickly. It gets you hooked. Working on level 76.
B003UMW62A|5.0|I absolutely just love this movie! I'm a big time Adam Sandler fan, so anything of his I'm watching it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This book is a page Turner and time burner. I love the acts of bravery on both sides,that fact that they lived to tell the story is amazing'
B005K01VZS|5.0|Mitch Albom knows how to bring the reader into his book, to loose themselves in the high and lows as well as the heart of the tale. Regardless of your religion, this is a story that addresses probably all the same questions you have asked yourself about your faith.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|These authors really know how to hold your interest.  Surprises galore.  Love these books!  Can not wait for the next one!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I absolutely love it! I read it before the movie and it was awesome!! Suzanne Collins over did it it in terms of everything SO AMAZING
B00E9A656K|5.0|I think this app is awesome because you could just look at it and it looks so real.<br />that's why I gave it 5 stares
1451624468|3.0|The explanation of Big Bang cosmology and general relativity was excellent. I learned a lot about both from reading the first parts of the book. Pages one through 21 are definitely a good way of starting off the book, with a complete explanation of the evidence for the Big Bang and simple diagrams to answer &#34;Where is the center of the universe ?&#34;. Indeed, even the critics of his thesis seem to agree that he did a good job of explaining science.<br /><br />I also enjoyed a lot of the humor in the book, like the jokes about the geometry skills of American high school students and the stereotype of the graduate student as a slave who does work the professors don't want to. The afterword from Richard Dawkins was beautiful as well.<br /><br />As somebody interested in the philosophy of physics, particularly the origins of the universe, I was excited to read this book. I wanted to see the argument that was presented by Krauss in favor of the idea that the universe came from nothing, especially after reading Quentin Smith's argument for the same idea in Theism, Atheism, and Big Bang Cosmology. Unfortunately, I found the title of the book to erroneous. The nothing that Lawrence Krauss describes in this book is not nothing. He is not describing the beginning of the universe from nothing, but the beginning of the universe from a quantum vacuum, which is described by physical laws and takes place in space-time. I don't think the content of the book lives up to the title. There is a debate in physics about whether virtual particles have real, ontological status, or if they are just results of equations and have no further implications on reality. I wish he had given more attention to this issue, because he didn't establish anything futher than the fact that the equations imply their existence. These two flaws were central to the purpose of the book.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend purchasing it. It has great explanations of physics, and you wil learn something bytime you put the book down. However, even as an atheist, I feel that Dr. Krauss failed to establish his thesis, ending with a 3/5.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|One of the best series I have ever read. Such a great story and the perfect ending. Definitely couldn't put it down.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game is excellent and awesome but sub zero needs to be in the game .sub zero is a heavy hitter like night wing.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A BOOK FULL OF MEANING OF LIFE AND LIFE IT SELF. EVERYONE GOES SOONER OR LATER. THIS BOOK WAS THE TRUE . MEANING.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Great graphics. And great hunting realism .keeps u on your feet .among one of the best games I've played.would recommend to all. Would look forward to the next edition.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|The best of all the &#34;American Pie&#34; movies. The bonus material is great. I laugh hard every time I watch this. Really enjoy this movie.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The characters' names were at times a little difficult to keep straight, but the book kept me enthralled and eager to read more.  I truly think it is one of Grisham's better books.  It seems to emphasize that awful things sometimes allow people to become more human.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This story is very intriguing, thought-provoking and hard to put down. This book made me laugh and cry, sometimes simultaneously.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Was working great on my nexus 7.  Latest update has so far been slow and buggy, and at this moment has quit working all together.
B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Excellent movie.  Just a pity they didn't release it this way to start with.  Just a way for them to make more money, + rip the fans off.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|Well, it is the Piano Guys and you really can't go wrong with anything they put on a CD. Looking forward to their next one.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it has so many nice features.  Easy to load and easy to play. The hint feature is nice to have if needed. excellent app.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I am so glad it finally came out for Kindle Fire I am basically addicted to this. Just as good as actual one. Worth the space it takes up on your Kindle though. Get it!!!
B003L77G6A|5.0|We enjoy it over and over. Well worth it as a gift. My daughter was in college and this was so endearing to her and her fellow students. She takes a season or two off to college  each semester, for a little down time.
0596805888|5.0|If you are a geek, programer, scientist - or someone who wants to know the why - then this book is for you. This book, along with McGee's book, are the two essential books for the curious cook - the person who wants to know a bit about modern cooking styles- and they are accentuated with some simple recipes from some of the experts. Speaking of experts there are 20 great interviews with people who are the tops in their profession - be it modern cooks, or bakers, or knife makers. I use this book as a reference, and go back to it time and time again. I like it so much I have two hard copies, and a kindle edition
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I synced with fb, I can't get the candy to switch places..this is why I quit playing it on fb..I don't even give it 1 star. Had too in order to leave a comment.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|really enjoy this game!<br />I cant seem to stop playing.  It is addictive! I could not purchase the full app from the trial versionnI had to contact. amazon to purchase!
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|I purchased this game and I was having fun with it until I got to the spot where I needed to find a hidden object.  You bury items behind the items stored that you need to solve the puzzle.  I thought I got lucky and finally clicked on it until I came across another one and found if I start from the bottom and swipe up I got lucky.  Now I am on my third one and I swiped every which way and an still stuck.  I am ready to delete this game.  I was going to purchase more games but after this mess I will not.  The games are suppose to be fun and this is NOT.  SHAME ON YOU!!!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|This movie is great . Has a lot of drugs and regular usual characters . Always a drug dealer that gets out of the life only to get drag back in. But the movie has a twist.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've heard this book be called a place holder. I think It stood on it's own!!!!<br />It was a great read! Full of great info to keep me informed on where we are as the story progresses
B0083GPDBO|3.0|Good teen 12-18. Movie for both sons & daughter movie . If you want to see a movie with you're teens see this movie. You and you're teens will actually put the cell phone ,tablet to see the movie . Really see it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book a lot of things left out in the movie.  I may read it again it was that good.
B0085776BG|3.0|Good movie . I wish they would've shown me back in high school. My history grades would've been high . A good way of showing part of American history. But it's not a bonding with you're early teen movie. This is more for a college kid. He will enjoy it with you .
B00G32QIEG|2.0|I like the two main actors in the movie, but I wouldn't recommend this movie.  It's a MIB rip off, and all I kept thinking while watching was I wished it would hurry up and end.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|Total bull just like he first one . Wait till you see it on cable . Not even the movie channel . Trust me
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Loved getting Corrie' s point of view. Pendergast was not absent, but he didn't chew all the scenery either. There was a good balance in the storytelling, and as always in a Pendergast novel, diabolical twists and cliffhanger. I have no idea where they are going with their next novel; I just know that I will be there.
B0083GQ2A0|4.0|Why is this movie so highly recommended by me? Because it can happened. This movie it's best seen in a big screen tv . In the dead of a winter storm. You'll love it .
B000007XUQ|5.0|Karen Carpenter is gone but not forgotten.  Thank you for this legacy of Christmas songs done only the way you could with crystal clarity and warmth.
B0071MV540|1.0|What a waste of time wait till it comes on regular tv. Not even the movie channels ,nor the cable channels
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Enya is a gift from heaven.  I've got most all of her CDs.  It took a short while to warm up to this CD but it delivers much enjoyment for me.  A great choice for me and possibly you.
B00DHNJCKQ|3.0|Good movie . Plot is as ugly and as corrupt as it can get . But the good guy always win . But it's not boring. You'll cheer for the good guy .
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Grandchildren age 5-7 enjoy playing this one.  Their mom put it on my Kindle when they were visiting during Thanksgiving, so it had already been tried and she knew it was one they would like playing.  She had it on her cell phone.  They seemed to enjoy the larger screen offered by the Kindle.
B0084RSYEK|2.0|Well Murphy is so boring as a comedian that he go out and make movies that only a three year old might like. Nice bonding movie for parents . But try not to fall a sleep . You're bonding with you're kid
B0002ADY1A|5.0|How could you not like this album. I used to wait for Uriah Heep albums to come out ever since my brother sent home a copy of their first album. It was the American release as he was in the navy doing gun line duty in Vietnam and he used to get all these great albums from the Americans he mixed with. I was instantly a Uriah Heep fan from 1970 onwards. I have this album on vinyl when it was released, then replaced it with the cd when it came out, and now this remastered version. I hope they don't come up with another format as enough is enough. It is just so good to hear your music cooked to perfection, just like this remastered edition. Some people go on about the warmth of vinyl but if you call hissing popping and crackling, warmth then you are welcome to it. With the advent of remastering old albums on cd you can hear your favorite music as crystal clear pleasing sound, even hearing little guitar and other instrumental sounds that you didn't know existed. If you love your Heep sound, I thoroughly recommend  you purchase this remastered version of one of the greatest albums ever released. Oh yeah this one has the best version of Bird Of Prey on it. I used it to manipulate very 'eavy back to the American version which I preferred. Stop reading this you should be buying this excellent album.
B008JAFXOQ|2.0|Poor girl she is so confused . This movie is for the read books mostly type . You will appreciated & wish you read the book instead .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Great book, there was a bit of language but considering the subject matter it's understandable. Pretty serious subject matter, not sure how I feel about it being a young adult novel but deeply moving and beautifully written.
B008ASLK8A|3.0|The movie makes Holmes look great with his karate skills . A fresh look at a character who was geeky and boring. Ok is over exaggerated but I like this Holmes better.
B00GTZJLAK|1.0|Stinks.....really stinks....what a let down after &#34;Cars&#34;.  All copies should be found and burned.  Big unwelcome surprise from favorite Pixar people.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|Well if all. Of the vamp movie be as good . This chick is so good she makes twilight look like a kids movie. She's not week and she's pissed .
B00B89WXYS|4.0|They are one of my favorite bands, but I like Waking Up better because the tracks were more musically interesting.
B00GNL96H8|3.0|Not clear what was the plot . But you will enjoy the action and the sexual tension. The movie will leave you with the satisfaction that Obama has a Chinese twin. Or he moonlights as a karate action star. In the whole movie you'll keep asking yourself . Nah he don't look like the president . And the other side will say yes! why ur trying to find out what this character is trying to say . Yet always return and say. damn he even has Obama swag.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is awesome. I'm hooked for life! I even told all my friends about it and their hooked too.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|Love the story and the graphics . It's a good staying home just watch a movie. You will fall in love
B008LXZFH6|1.0|Not only totally lacking in humor and in very bad taste but also poorly made as well. I'd like to give it zero stars but the lowest choice was one so I'll choose that.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|This movie is good typical ex con gets caught up again . While trying to the the right thing. But ! Theirs a twist. See the movie and find out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Acting is superb,Can't wait to watch each episode. I love stories about that era! It is very well written and the characters seem so real! Love it
B008EQIEWS|3.0|What a great movie . Don't see this movie on ur phone or tablet . You have to see it in a big screen tv to appreciate this movie. So go Titan you'll need every inch of a 55-80 inch tv . But it will make you so proud you bought the tv in the first place.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|These graphics are much better in kindle than ps3, second this has better gameplay, third the tutorial is 2 seconds long :D
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Just completed this game on my chinese 4,5 chinese smartphone. It works perfect. Objects are not too small. Graphics are just amazing. The puzzles are not too hard.<br />This is worth the money. It would even be worth more.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|this is a great game to play I love it. anyone can eenjoy this game yuong or old guy or girl
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this is a very fun game but it is very slow it takes about 5 minutes to get back in the game but if you don't mind waiting you should get it.
B005HED08I|5.0|The only way that watching on my kindle could be better is if it looked like a tricorder.  Of course the screen would be smaller then. For those of us who watched this show when it originally aired, what is cooler than watching it on your own handheld device?
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|A really excellent retelling of the Superman story. Superman stories can often fall into the trap of &#34;he's perfect and thus can't be beat&#34;. In this movie he's very 'human' in his way of thinking and while not weak by any means, he's vulnerable. It makes for a believable 'just getting started' Superman.<br /><br />A couple disappointments: 1) There is a lot said about how the human race will handle Superman when he finally reveals himself, but there is no pay-off. 2) Somewhat related, Superman seems to have little regard for his surroundings while fighting. Given the moral compass we see set earlier in the film some effort on his part to take the fighting away from occupied areas would have felt more true to the Superman character.  In saying that I can only imagine how the humans felt at the end of the movie regarding Superman.  Perhaps that's to be addressed in a future movie.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|Although the complexity of the Hannah's planning seems slightly far fetched, the message behind this story really resonated with me. Don't judge. Be kind. Your words and actions matter.
B00FATEJYE|3.0|The game is great but the recharge thing is a pain in the ass. Some can someone please fix that.<br /><br />Thank you :)
B002PJHW4Q|5.0|It's actually a very painful movie to watch--it drags on and on and on--and the acting is horrible, the background music cloying and repetitive, and I could go on. HOWEVER it is necessary to watch this movie to be able to fully appreciate Monty Python's Holy Grail--our family's favorite movie!
1781162646|5.0|Enthralling, charming, and heartbreaking. I loved every page! Thoughtful characters and an engaging plot, what more could you ask for?
B00EPVTLKU|5.0|Ariana has such a beautiful and natural voice!!!  We just love her!  So worth buying no matter what the price!  LOVE  LOVE  LOVE!!!

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|brought me right back to one of his first and greatest!  Always wondered what happened to Jake and his wife.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This as most all of John Grisham's novels grabs the reader, from the first page and never lets go.<br />The characters are always realistic and you just want to know what is going to happen.<br />This is my long time favorite author and this book does not disappoint his fans.
1480191353|5.0|I appreciated that the book came very quickly and arrived without any damage ! Thank you. As far as the content<br />of the book is concerned, I will certainly not love it ! But although it is now too late to do anything about what happened in those years, one should feel concerned about such dreadful events and perhaps learn out of this to be aware in order to help avoiding disastrous developments.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I am addicted to Lisbeth an her story.  I wish that I would be able to write such a genius story and be able to create such an interesting character ....  I is hard to say goodbye after only three books ... It is hard to let her go ....
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game where you get to go and build your own amazing town with malls, mills, theatre's, and hospitals/fire stations
B00A7L00XE|5.0|What a combo...Ben and Charlie really sound soooo good together. The title track is just the kinda music to turn up loud! Enjoy!
B00AEBB89W|4.0|This is a good account of the case, but somewhat rambling and poorly written.  I'm sure the author wanted to get it out before anyone else could write one.  Read it in concert with his second book, &#34;Zodiac Unmasked&#34; which reiterates a lot, but brings information together more logically, and is MUCH better written.
B0088W6Y7K|5.0|A must watch show. I wish that they would have made a follow-up to provide closure of the series like they did for Stagnate SG1.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great game for passing time..  Almost addictive.  The more you play it the better you can see the best moves.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|.  This game is one of the first games I wake up and start plaingThis game is very addicting.  Once you start playing you will get hooked
B00BRUQ3PS|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books of this series, but was a bit disappointed in this last one. The story was just more of the same re-telling of the past of a different character, whereas I wished it had more focus on the present and future of the characters.
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|I don't like this season, especially this last episode. I am going to cancel my subscription. I don't like this season.
B00847KFDS|5.0|What a great CD. All the songs are song by John plus other great singers. It is put together in a great way, taking the old CCRs/ John's songs and putting a new spin on them.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|This was a very good movie, full of action.  Just a little dark and sometimes hard to make out scenes.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The ideas are nothing new but they are presented in a fresh easy to understand way.  I have done the experiments and have been giving the book as gifts to my friends so they can try them too.  I am waiting so we can discuss the interesting results.  I am fairly impressed with the results of my own experiments.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|if you are new be shere to check it out!! is the best! you have to Colette coins and is Christmas time Agana I don't now if this vershon haze the three.days of SAM but....injoy!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I do not like the ads popping up but the game itself is good. I like the ability to play a winning hand.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I played the original Castleville and I loved it. I am thrilled that this great game is now available on the kindle fire hd!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I truly love minecraft it is a awesome game to play! when is the next minecraft 's next update. Because I love the app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My parents love this show and got my wife and I hooked on it as well. It is a nice alternative to all the trash that dominates television these days. Give it a few episodes before you form your opinion on the show.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Having the book narrated by Death was brilliant. Much of the most thought provoking dialogue, for me, was that of the Narrator. I have read many books, written from varying perspectives, dealing with this particular period in history. I appreciated that Mr. Zusak's focus was on five central characters, which lent a very intimate perspective. The relationship between Leisel and her father was both heart warming and heart wrenching. Leisel, her father and mother, her best friend and Max will linger in your thoughts long after you've finished reading...
B008JFUPFI|3.0|Great movie but walmart had it cheaper I found out after I already bought it . Same with &#34;In to the darkness&#34;.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series of books that really makes you think. It causes you to question where we are heading.  It's fiction with the possibility future reality.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is addictive and has me continuously looking forward to the next episode. However, I don't. Think it's fair that you come so close to winning and the app ask you to purchase more moves. IJS
B0055SWM08|5.0|This app is one to use while you are waiting...the music is calm, the puzzles require thought, and you can enjoy the accomplishment of completing the levels perfectly.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|EXCELLENT!  Arctic cold snap across the US including Austin, TX and so grateful to have this now!  This is a great add-on to the alarm and vice versa.
B0012GMY64|5.0|I've long had this on LP and CD, but after misplacing the CD decided to re-buy it. This is a wonderful collection, and one need only sample his &#34;Moon River&#34; to see how great it is!  Will ALWAYS love it!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|i was having problem memory and now i can see everything very fasy. well done very good app. keep up the good work
B00466M25A|3.0|This is a favorite film of mine, but buyers need to know that this version with the hot new cover has only bare bones 2.0 audio as opposed to the 5.1 surround of the original with the familiar cover. Had I not already opened this, I would have sent it back. Ironically, at the time this came out, it was priced nearly twice as much as the other, which was why I just assumed it would be the better of the 2. So be careful!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|What a read! This book is pure genius in its use of language, and depiction of the highest and lowest of culture. Superb.
B008D37SGU|4.0|If your into that classic romance stuff. Wonderful movie, played by more wonderful actors and actresses. You'll dive right into the deep blue sea with this movie.
B00G4A6VZS|5.0|Great game to learn geography for the older kids. My 9 year-old enjoys playing it and has learned where the countries are located and facts about them.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have played through several times and it never gets old.  Love the bonus chapters and the ability to play the minigames when I want a &#34;quickie&#34;.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|A very fun game. I lose myself and all track of time. Sometimes I find that I have played for hours.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|while not as focused to me as shrunken heads. any music by this legend is alway welcomed. what a wordsmith. like mr. bowie the genis is in the details.
B00AZMFK3K|2.0|The film is great, the special features not so much.Only about 7 small special feature documentaries.For a film this successful I would have assumed more in this film.Also I don't know if it was Amazon or if thats how the film is packaged but expected there to be a slip case with it.All the others ones I've seen not sold by Amazon have slip covers.Over all, not the best Black Monday product I was expecting.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|i like fall out boy. concert goers will love alot of this music. toward the end it stated sounding the same. it was loud it was moving . but i had the new bowie in the same vehcle. bowie just sounded more refined and fresher. more layers less boombast.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I like being able to choose a different song to wake up to every morning.  On work days it is usually something to get me going.  Alarms for other reasons, such as the one that goes off once a week to remind me to put the trash out at the curb.
B00BR0SGN0|5.0|i did not even know deep purple where still around let alone making great music like this. what a history this group has. just a good consistant purple album/cd.
B00ARHAAZ6|3.0|The pages turned quite rapidly for me with this book. Sanderson continues to build ever unique and exciting worlds. For all it's grandiose characters, this is probably one of the simpler novels from this author. I wouldn't say there were a lot of surprises, but it was a fun read nonetheless.
B00FANXZL8|5.0|this cd is not just one of the best of 2013. this music is some of bowies best. the next day just flows. so many pieces of mr. bowies noted music. the whole thing is just comfort music to the ear. the extra cd is is again just great. i hope more music from mr. bowie will follow . i thank him for this music ,it helped my year and is still in both my vehcles.
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Amazing! Full of action, suspense, puppy love and an Alien you come to respect and admire! What more can you ask for! Very well done, believable story line. Not a movie I watch over and over, but one of the better science fiction films I have seen.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|this is still a go too cd. great music in so many different styles. imaginative thru out. holds up to repeated listening.
B00EHMG358|3.0|I usually really enjoy Preston and Child, but this sample was boring. The first chapter concerning Oscar Wilde and Arthur Conan Doyle grabbed my interest, but it was downhill from there for me.
B0018BB21G|5.0|i had this in cassette form in the mid seventies. i am a big fan of this band, they were my first live concert in 1978, and after hundreds of shows, that one remains in my top five shows.what a talented band with a top five all time vocalist, justin hayward. this album front to back is great ,  and heres a special mention to a specific song.... the actor should bring me to a bad place with its gloomy and lonely overtones,  but it is amazingly uplifting for me. amazing how music affects different people differently
B00006AFF5|5.0|I do not like reading long reviews so I will keep this simple.<br />1)  I LOVE the original Grinch cartoon.<br />2) Loving the original I was afraid this would not capture the spirit of the Grinch<br />3) THis move 100% captured the spirit of the Grinch with updated humor.<br /><br />WARNING - do not watch the extended version.  They placed back in scenes that hit the cutting room floor that were originally cut because they ruin the flow of the movie....  The theatrical version is the one you want to watch...!!!
B0083TXXZ4|3.0|Construction is so-so.  I think the kids prefer a pump gun to one that requires batteries.  The armor pieces on the side fall off a lot.  It DOES shoot well and hold a lot of ammo.
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Can never go wrong with a Michael Connelly Book. It was perfect for quick stories to read during the evening. Never read one of his books I didn't like.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is outstanding. I loved and savored every minute of this book. I will recommend this to many friends. This book is a must read for any book lover.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|A wonderful package that feels very together and has some nice art, makes me feel like a true Alien fan, looks nice sitting on movie rack, 2 of the best sci-fi films of all time are in this package, it's a pretty good deal
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|The perfect prequel for the only movie that scared the s*** out of me.  My mother didn't even want to look at it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think it is a very very very good group of the dead in a good group of guy g f huff
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|Terrible  poor graphics and a poor star wars rip off type movie. Dont believe the overall ratings. I warned you.
B007R11DKQ|5.0|The cast, script and special effects are all excellent. Very entertaining for all, even adults. Good wholesome entertainment for everyone.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|I like how there is a fight between Matt and Maude alot and I feel im always in the background
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|this story held your interest from start to finish.  Many twist and turns, just waiting to see where it will take you.  At topnotch John Grisham book, well written.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love how the author sneaks the kids in at  the end. A book any reader would love and cherish!!
B00F880BWG|4.0|I was a bit disappointed with the way season 4 was going until they brought back the governor! I have been engrossed in the action ever since.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|This was a great movie!  My friend and I throughly enjoyed it. Good movie for family and friends. I missed Boo though.
B00B19GKI0|3.0|Saw it a long time ago and thought it was OK then.  Have not seen it since. I might have taken a quick look but did not watch it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great stress deliver I play it casually during watching TV.  I WATCH tV while waiting for my coins to regenerate. Great fun.
B00003CXPD|5.0|Totally a great movie.  Did not expect it to be.  Thought it would be more for my wife but was wrong.
B00E0H8KAQ|5.0|Fantastic collection by some of the best musicians and ensembles ever to record the classical repertoire!<br />The quality of the recordings are rich and clear. Very happy with this set.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is beyond amazing. Some basic knowledge is needed, but otherwise the app makes a second language very easy and fun to learn. I would recommend this app to anyone with an interest in learning a second language. I only wish I had found it sooner.
B005H7WDTC|5.0|I first purchased the cd set and was quickly impressed with the talent of this conductor. I own 47 different Beethoven Symphony cycles and this one along with Karajan's 1963 cycle, Bernstein's cycle with Vienna and Cluyten's are my favorites.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Weather prediction seems like a fortune teller. 50/50 chance of being right or wrong.  If YOU SEE ANIMALS RUNNING IN PANIC, Run  with them.
B005D51II0|5.0|Both this set and the analogue one are a pair to own if you love classical music. Filled with the best artists to record the masters.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|Hours of enjoyment and imagination for the grandson.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|Wow twists all the way to the end. Worth the read, despite being a little slow at the beginning. Enjoy.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|The game is great and all but it would be even great when multiplayer is added to the next UPDATES! But anyways I'm happy with the game.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|If I had reviewed this within a few days of purchase it would've got 5 stars. But now I've found a real flaw. In snooze mode, when you've arisen before the next alert, it Won't let you turn it off!!!!! This is a real annoyance-hence only 3 stars.
B007FH9GA6|4.0|Awesome movie, but I do suggest you watch the Swedish version with the subtitles.  It tells the story more clearly and leaves out the unnecessary dialogue .
B00FLDG5BE|2.0|I swear I read (a few months ago) that Steve Winwood performed at this 2013 concert, but I see he's not listed. Serious bummer. I was all set to buy the BluRay but now I think I'll pass because he's not on it.
B00GX50BD2|4.0|Well, I must admit that after having watched this movie, I came away with the conclusion that the movie was so much better than what I thought it would be after seeing the trailer when it was first out. I honestly thought that Ashton Kutcher did an admirable job in portraying Jobs. I read the biography that the movie was based on and I feel like the script was well written and touched on the important highlights of Jobs' life. No movie biography can encompass every important aspect of a person's life unless you're willing to sit and watch that movie for 3+ hours! Given the limitations of time, I thought the story of how Apple came to be was fairly well represented. Woz was well portrayed along with the other people who made up the original gang in the garage. If you're interested in computers, the history of Apple, etc., it's worth watching this movie!
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is one of the best socializing app i hav seen. This is so much better than regular texting. If ulyou dont have a phone and you still want to communicate  with your friends, this is the app for you.
B002NXSRW0|1.0|Ordered this in May of 2013 and was supposed to come with 2 DVDs. The actual movie DVD was missing. The case was shrink wrapped and still had the seal but no movie DVD, just the special features DVD was in it.
1586638491|3.0|I found this version of The Tempest very helpful as it allows readers to enjoy both the Shakespearean text and a modern translation at the same time. What I did not appreciate was the translation of some of the Shakespearean curses into twenty-first century profanity. I don't believe that this is what Shakespeare intended.<br />However, it is still overall a helpful resource.
B00AHDXTIK|1.0|I purchased two of these so i could travel and use them at home. They have both failed. The connector bent on both, and the cable will charge my iphone 5s intermittently depending on how the cable is arranged. I'm very disappointed.
145210655X|5.0|This book is perfect for all the star wars dads out there. You have to have seen all the movies to understand the humor. Its more for the dad than the child. My daughter didn't quite get the jokes. But I'm glad I got it for my husband, he loves it
B007UXTG8M|4.0|This film is dark and moody (so for me, it is surprising that I would like it). But I would say that's a work of art without being pornographic, in the traditional style. The characters are real, the script is real, the performances are very good and the use of music is excellent.<br />The storyline can be difficult to get through. But it does reveal a slice of life and a part of humanity that I would otherwise never know about. Beginning with the title itself, that word, &#34;shame&#34; conjures up a multitude of complex thoughts, as does this film. I think it's well done, but may be hard to watch for some. It's not for everyone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very well written story. Captivating, deep and touching. A recommended book, a reminder of how we should never forget the past!
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|It seemed a bit all over the place. Hard to believe that a fifteen year old boy committed such mayhem.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|In my opinion I think this is the best app for kindle fire. If you like shooters then this game was made for you.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I'm very conflicted in my opinion of this book.  At 25% through I was so frustrated and irritated with the author's style I almost felt like hurling my Kindle at the wall; at the same time, I was interested enough in the story to re-check the Amazon reviews to figure out what led me to buy the dang book in the first place.  I read all the glowing reviews and felt like an alien for my reaction.....so I finished the bike.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know if I've ever read such &#34;controlling&#34; writing....I don't know what else to call it.  A lot of people obviously love the extreme descriptive detail....and the talent and vocabulary usage are impressive.  I just prefer well crafted prose - which there were examples here I savored - that then allow the reader's imagination to take over.  Here I had to slog through tedious descriptive detail as though a narrator were describing a movie to a blind person while simultaneously reading a script of the character's internal dialogue.<br /><br /> I don't know if I'm making sense but my point is there was too much detail for the amount of story momentum involved......but it was a good story idea so if you're good at skimming through a lot of boring stuff to get to where something actually happens again......
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Good series.  Love the storyline and the historical perspective of folks who lived through World War I & II.  Hope viewers enjoy as much as I have.
B002PZ6XB8|5.0|It was a lovely movie. The photography and the Lakes' District scenes are beautiful. The story is well written also.
B007SGM084|5.0|it touches my hart in places I can't explain, the unusual story and unusual circumstances it really brings the &#34;ordinary to extraordinary &#34; as the book says...
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|You did not offer six stars or I could have rated even higher than just five!  Content and reception of both audio and streaming video on full HD - plus closed caption.  Wow!
B000002KKC|3.0|The best of Tusk would have made a great single LP, but coming on the heels of the massive bestseller Rumours, the band ( especially Buckingham) apparently felt it had the musical capital to explore the freedom that comes with a double LP.Some mediocrity, some failed experiments and one successful one, the title track which was an international hit and something genuinely different from the band.Despite its flaws, fans will probably want this.
B00DHNBPA6|3.0|Just a remake of the original.  I just getting too old or the horror is getting old.  I was rather bored with the movie
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This book is worth the wait. Macolm Gladwell opens a new window of how the world can be viewed. Many factors of our lives are in the right part of the inverted curve, which perfectly explains the &#34;good old time elusion&#34;.
B00G70WLJA|4.0|Excellent movie.  The ending is leading to the upcoming X-men movie in 2014 and had introduced some new people into the Wolverines life.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I USE MY KINDLE, AND I ALWAYS USED KIK, THEN IT RANDOMLY SIGNED ME OUT AND WEN I TRY SIGNING BACK IT, IT SAYS ERROR, TACKING LONGER THAN EXPECTED, LIKE, WTF KIK
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|You really get to know the characters and empathize with them - good and bad. No loose ends in the end.
B007N85POS|5.0|Being a Angry Bird crazed fan, who has bought many Angry Bird games; I got this free with my Kindle Fire HD this week!....just about  to buy this game --& when my Kindle Fire HD came.....- this was already there! ..... I'm thrilled!<br />&#34;Rio &#34; is very cool as well!  There really  are no bad Angry Bird games- all are fun! Thanks sooo much Amazon!!!
B004R739LE|5.0|It has become mt favorite pack, I can carry my camera plus two lenses, flash and external light source, first aid kit, 3x32oz drink, t-shirt and lunch plus I can attach a tripod on the bottom.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Overall it was good, lots of B.S. politics, would be five stars if the Marines were depicted throughout the book.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My son is 4 and he can simply not get enough of this game! He loves it and I love to watch him play it, it's fun cute and his little face lights up when I watch him play it! No regrets in buying here! One of the best apps I've bought for children A++++++ if you have young children highly recommend it
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I can write all I need here! My stories and journals are in one place. So I am very happy south this app!
B002LATN9G|4.0|I have not watched this movie.  I bought it for my 27 year old son in the Army.  He was thrilled with it.  He had seen it before and wanted it for his own.  I guess if you are a young man it is the movie for you,.
B00C2UUDMG|5.0|I just love the meticulous way Michael Connelly writes. I love the way he clearly wets out the thought processes within his characters minds.
B00005N6KG|1.0|First off, I bought two pair of these headphones in February 2012.  The first pair recently broke so I am on the 2nd pair now.  I only paid $7.03 each for them.  At this price they were a very good deal.  I like the headphones because they are very light.  I can forget I even have them on.  The sound is decent too, not great but pretty good.  Well now that I am down to my last pair I thought I would come back and order more.  What gives?  $64.99??????  These are NOT worth $65!  I would have paid $15 - $20 for them at the most.  At $65 they can keep them.  I will look elsewhere.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Most of the other apps that I have installed do not look very well on my kindle but evermore looks the best.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|I already owned all the songs on the first disc, but the second disc was a great surprise. The demo's are great.
6305308659|5.0|If you haven't seen this classic it is a fun movie with a lot of life lessons.Very &#34;Colorful&#34; book pun intended.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|pros: it cools like a dream.  my i5 runs at 30 or under now.<br /><br />cons: it is huge like an xbox.  it pretty much bumps up against my side panel, forcing me to remove the side panel's fan.<br /><br />it only includes 1 fan, contrary to some of the pictures, although this is clearly stated in a few places on the amazon order page, if you bother to read the whole thing.<br /><br />it's awkward to install, i would recommend (and this probably seems obvious to people who've built more computers than me) completely removing the mobo from the case for the entire installation of this fan.  i took it out and only put the bracket behind the case in before replugging in the mobo, and lining up the heatsink with the screw plate while it's in the case is a bitch.<br /><br />i chalk that up to my inexperience with doing it before... but the instruction manual is pretty terrible as well, and provided almost no written instructions to accompany the 7 tiny pictures depicting how to put the mount together.  it provided the 3 lines of written instruction in about 20 different languages, though.<br /><br />still, it cools great, the default fan isn't loud, and the side panel fan just went onto the other side.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|Death by half-voice. Badly sung. They should let themselves go int the singing, instead of the withdrawn, swallowed sound. It's a bore.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The story was a beautiful one. I gave it five stars because of the honesty and love that is found even in the harshest of times.  It shows how you really don't know someone unless you really know them. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, for it was very easy to read, funny and thought-provoking. I recommend it to all ages. I always feel books like these need to be read by all, because they may make us a better person.
0316228583|1.0|I did not care for this book.  I did not finish it as it didn't hold my interest.  Disappointing.  She writes well but this book is difficult to follow.  Others in my book club agreed with me on this book.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love it, no latency issues during streaming from my phone (Galaxy S3), quality is good enough that I don't see any pixilation issues.
B0081336FO|5.0|Very entertaining! The dynamic of the entire cast is intriguing and the intricacy of the plot keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Terrible book. Poorly written, a cop-out having dual points of view (but, when one does that, one really needs to differentiate better who is actually talking!), and unsatisfactory plot &#34;twists&#34;.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Far too much graphic language & nudity. Understandably it is a rough story that probably happens frequently, but the graphic nature of the portrayal is tough to watch at times. Acting was excellent, but the gratuitous depiction of Christians (the co-pilot's wife) was not necessary or accurate.
B00GSAC1UI|5.0|Pentatonix has shown that the only one needs to hear beautiful music is ones voice. It is so refreshing to hear music in its purest form. I do hope that they bring more traditional Christmas music out next year.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|This movie was great! Watched it with my girlfriend last night and we both enjoyed it very much. Very high quality production for a TV movie.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh my god I really don't like cliffhangers lol. But what some people don't realize is it makes the next book that much more exciting when it comes out. I was so captivated with Gideon and Eva's story I didn't realize the book had ended. I was like no!!!! Can't not wait till the next one is out. You did a great job with the crossfire books.
B00FLNQBTK|4.0|All in all this movie had some really good parts to laugh hard about. I was actually surprised. I didn't expect much out of this movie. The only real negative was that it was bad enough that I am not sure I would want to tell people I watched it and definitely not encourage people to watch it. I have to give it 4 stars though, because it was above what I expected.<br /><br />I will say though, more than half the scenes shown in the trailer are NOT in the movie. They were edited or changed for the final cut. Sadly they were way more funny in the trailer than what they ended up going with.
B00E9E4EC8|5.0|Such a smooth, easy to listen to voice.  Loved the bluegrass direction he took on this album.  No surprises, just a pleasant experience.
B00FY2TQMW|4.0|I have seen all of the Fast and Furious. This isn't the worst and isn't the best, but it is near the top of the list. I thoroughly enjoyed that they brought back Letty. The action scenes were excellent. The airplane/runway scene was a bit 'extended'. Many may say they tried to put more story into this one and that is true, but I believe they did so pretty well. It did seem to be over fairly quickly, but the teaser for the next one has me excited how it will go. If you liked any of the previous movies you really should see this one.<br /><br />I watched this before the death of Paul Walker. From what I understand they had most of the scenes shot for the movie, so we will see how they end the show and if they keep the scene with Paul Walker at the graveyard.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|You just can't go wrong! Buy it and turn up the volume! JB really tears it up from beginning to the end.
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|Just. Phenomenal.  James Murphy's touch adds so much, a dose of LCD Soundsystem's building percussions can be heard throughout.  It's a very diverse record…hits on many levels highly recommend!
B00FLDG5BE|4.0|I own all the Crossroads video concerts. If you are a fan of this music offering, you look forward to the next one to be produced to add to your collection.  I'm eagerly waiting for Joe Bonamassa to make an appearance for a few songs!  I would have given this recent release 5 stars, had it not been for the somewhat poor video quality.  I experienced both a grainy picture and flashing of the video reproduction.  The sound quality is excellent. I have never adjusted my tv monitor for anything I watch, as I love the picture as it is (so why maybe ruin a good thing). Actually, when really vocused on the artists and the music, I didn't notice all that much. Listen and enjoy...because many of these recording artists are ageing, and will be moving on up the road.
B0049U4INC|3.0|The book is well written but this time I didn't learn much new insights. The content in the book has being discussed by marketing blogs and editorials over and over again. Yet, the book revised and structured my knowledge about how to engage with customers and co-workers.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|it was a well written book that held my interest from cover to cover. Jake made it a life changing event
B0055PGUYU|5.0|It was a very insightful experience reading this book. Not only I mastered my knowledge professionally in marketing, I also understood the forces behind my actions, actions of my friends, and whole societies. Great book!
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app now wakes me up on my Kindle every morning!  Its gentle sound doesn't jar me awake like my traditional alarm used to.  I've donated my old alarm clock.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|As always, Gaiman delivers!  This little story is somehow sadly sweet and scary as hell at the same time!  It takes you back to that time when you were a kid and absolutely knew without a doubt that there bloody well WAS something under the bed that would eat your ass in a heartbeat if you so much as stepped a single toe over the edge of the bed.  Grab a cup of tea, your blankie and curl up in front of the fire with this one.  Very good read!
B00DJ80VMM|4.0|Prior to my decision to download this album, I had never heard of the group Dream Theater.  The song samples, however, intrigued me enough that I was willing to pony up the price of an album for a full musical tour; I simply wanted to hear more of what this band had to offer.  So I downloaded and launched the file.<br /><br />Right away, I noticed that the band had precise timing and perfectly blended instrumentals, and that the melody lines were complex and interesting.  I went back to surfing the net, thinking I would play the album in the background.  After listening for a few minutes, however, I realized that the music had completely captured my attention because my eyes were closed and my fingers were resting lightly on the keyboard, motionless.<br /><br />As a general rule, I am not a big fan of heavy metal music.  While I didn’t like all of the parts of all of the songs, there wasn’t a song on the album that I didn’t enjoy, overall.  I’m not sure that the description of “heavy metal” is accurate to describe the music created by Dream Theater.  But you can call it anything you like as long as I get to listen because this album speaks to the musician in me.
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a wonderful romance story! I bought extras to give as gifts. It is a must for your DVD collection

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|One of the best games, bar none, out there...and for free. Levels get increasingly harder and your skills are put to the test! Don't ever pay for anything and you will be more than happy with the challenges.
B00AH3DCAA|1.0|Bought this watch because it was a good homage to the submariner . Registered at invicta . One year and a couple months the crown started pulling out . If you tried to adjust the time it would get so lose you couldn't . The crown with the stem almost came all the way out . Took it to a local watch jeweler since my warrantee was expired by 2 months and they said they could fix it for 150.00 . They said they wouldnt if it were them because its a Chinese watch . I said no its a Swiss sw200 movement . They said its like a car , it might be a Fred but that doesnt mean that it has all ford parts . I dd some research and found out they were right . Invicta uses Chinese parts in their Swiss movements . How is this possible ? As long as the cost of the movement is 50% or more Swiss made than it can be called Swiss . Being that Swiss parts cost much more than Chinese you can have the base movement Swiss and that cost is well over 50% of the movements value even if the rest was Chinese because the Chinese parts AR so cheap in comparison . Do some research on the web . I wish I did more before my purchase . I would stay clear of t.v. brands over 100.00$ . For just about a hundred bucks more you can buy a Hamilton Khaki Field . 100% Swiss . I ended up getting a Hamilton and couldn't be happier I did . So do some searches on google . We all want to make educated choices with our hard earned money . Good luck with whatever watch you might choose .
B005LAIGZU|5.0|WAY WAY better than I thought it would be!! I heard from everyone that I must watch and I have not been big into war movies but this one is honestly amazing!!
B003YOZNBU|5.0|AWESOME movie!!! Saw it when it was in theaters and loved it! great for both male and female! highly recommend
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|This book was detailed but too long. I liked the historical references but sometimes it took too long to get to the point of why something was happening to a character.
193700788X|5.0|LOVE this series of books, would recommend EVERYONE to read them! Its not exactly like the show, in fact the True Bood series takes a way different turn so being a fan of both its nice to have the books be different, you never know what is going to happen! Charlaine Harris does a great job at keeping you interested without getting bored, the whole series is a page turner that you dont want to put down!
B003G4W49C|3.0|Ender's Game was an OK story but not very captivating for my reading tastes. I had some difficulty relating to a group of pre-teen boys chosen to save the world. For me the ending was a real let down.
B004LWZW24|5.0|I didnt like the movie but my husband did. He is who I ordered it for. Came brand new as stated, and arrived before the estimated delivery date!!
B00766CLPI|5.0|This new release contains more than the original. It is Barbra's most brilliant album, as she uses her voice as an instrument in several of the cuts. It is both exquisite and somewhat haunting.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|A great game...so much fun and challenging!  I really do enjoy playing it!  Everyone would like it young and old.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Get this series now!!! I was blown away by this story from page 1! This is like Game of Thrones mixed with Eragon mixed with Sword in the Stone mixed with Lord of the Rings! Very impressed and can't wait for Book 2!
B001QWBM62|5.0|I am more and more in awe with this thing every single time I use it.  I am a cinematographer so I frequently use it with booms, shotguns, and lavaliers.  You really cannot beat 4ch simultaneous recording.  And I bought this knowing ahead of time that it can provide phantom power to the XLR jacks, but I didn't know it actually lets you select how much phantom power to provide.<br /><br />Zoom seriously went all out with this one.  It is the one piece of equipment *everyone* should have if they work with audio in any way.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Even though it is not exactly like the book, this movie did an excellent job of condensing the story so it made sense.
B004SIP7S0|5.0|this is not the first time that i seen this film but i always wanted to own it to watch it when ever i wanted too.
B00G15MDI0|4.0|I am unfamiliar with the book, so this review will take the movie on its own terms.  The narrative structure begins rather surprisingly, with Death as the deep-voiced, but mellow, narrator.  In 1938 in Nazi Germany, an orphan named Liesel is adopted by a bristly new mother and much gentler new father.  Emily Watson plays the mother and Geoffrey Rush the father.  Liesel gets to know a blonde-haired, pleasant, free-spirited boy in the town, Rudy, and also must face the daily struggle of hiding a Jewish refugee named Max for over 2 years, after Kristallnacht.  She also secretly raids the Burgermeister's personal library because she wants to read, which becomes another major subplot.<br /><br />The story is original and has some moments of deep suspense, but since it strives for realism, also has tragedy; that's the way life goes in war.  (My own personal reaction to its theme about the fragility of life:  Stories like this are strong reminders to me of how unbearable life can be when you don't have a basis for confidence about life after death.  Too bad that in her love of literature, the character Liesel didn't discover the Bible and the hope it offers of that!)<br /><br />I found it worth seeing, though it is deeply sad in ways.  There are enjoyable sentimental and suspenseful moments in it, though. The actors all do very well, including the Liesel actress, Sophie Nélisse, and Nico Liersch, who plays her boyfriend Rudy.  The quality acting helps the movie feel like an authentic rendition of life under the Nazi regime.  I most of all like Geoffrey Rush's characterization of the adopted father, Hans Hubermann.  He ought to get an Academy Award for his great performance.  Additionally, John Williams wrote the music to this, his first non-Spielberg collaboration in a long while.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Great sequel and my kids loved it. This movie is really funny and great for all ages. Good clean family fun.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I really like the game but not the concept of the limited lives.  It's frustrating having to wait for the new ones to be granted.  If I was a better player it wouldn,t be as much of a problem.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I really enjoy using Duolingo.. I have it on my kindle, my phone and I even occasionally use it on my computer.. n.n I wish they would add more languages then just the ones they have but oh well.. Little by little I am able to get a better comprehension of the languages (yes I am trying to learn several of them at once) and with Duolingo it is easier then sitting in a class.. n.n I encourage them to continue working with it, and maybe possibly adding some new languages soon? o.o Just a thought.. n.n
B000FC130E|5.0|Mr Gaiman's books capture me for hours, torturing, stealing my breath. Thank you for such facinating stories. I shll certainly pass these on to my offspring.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|This is a awesome game and ive wated for this to come out on kindle. some stuff to change but other than that it is worth $5.00!
B003H4I4JU|1.0|Ugh.  Talk, talk, talk, talk.  A mildly interesting plot development.  Talk, talk.  Actually, more like proselytizing.  Stop at Ender's Game.
B000OP1M6M|4.0|This is a very attractive watch and it has a workhorse of a movement. It's the kind of watch that you can expect to wear day in and day out, never get it serviced, and have it perform just as it did on day one. I know, because I have owned the forerunner of this model with the same movement for 20+ years and without incident.<br /><br />But there are a couple of issues that I need to mention. First, this watch is manufactured in such a way as to suggest quality control problems. I purchased this watch (and it's sister watch) recently and, knowing a bit about watches, I believe that the wildly errant timekeeping (between 1 and 5 seconds an hour) was due to a loose regulator arm. I contacted the seller (Dexclusive) within a few days of receiving the watch with the intent of getting it repaired instead of returning it. The conversation (and lack thereof) suggested to me that Dexclusive had no interest in fixing the watch they sold to me - which gave me worries should other warranty issues kick in down the line. So I simply returned the watch (and it's sister watch that I had also purchased from Dexclusive). I don't blame Dexclusive for the watch problems. That's pretty much the luck of the draw. I blame them for their lack of customer service.<br /><br />Because I purchased through Amazon fulfillment, my return to them was quick and easy. I then repurchased but this time from E Watch Stock on Amazon. My conversations with James from that company convinced me that E Watch Stock had a genuine interest in customer service. And, lucky for me, the watches I received from them appear to be very accurate after the 3 day break in period. If this changes, I'll revise my ad to reflect it.<br /><br />So, great watch in design, though there seems to be some quality control issues on the manufacturing level.<br /><br />Going through Amazon Fulfillment is definitely the way to go.<br /><br />And finally, the company who actually sells the watch makes all the difference.
B003G4W49C|2.0|Interesting concept, slow plotting, silly characters.  Other reviewers have noted that kids don't talk like this and there are some really silly plot points.  But harmless enough to fill few hours.  This is the first of 5 books in the Ender series.  Stop at this one.

B00GH4RKYM|2.0|Not what I expected. Too dark, plot line is sporadic, it was hard to follow and not appropriate for children.
B0014VQGX4|2.0|It broke after two months of not very hard playing.  The back hoe broke first then the scooper up front.  My son is careful with his toys and used it to just to play with it the right way.  Very disappointed to spend this much money for two months of play.  I would not buy anything from this toy company again as the Skid Loader did the exact same thing.  Not much fun to play with broken attachments.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was light hearted and fun for the whole family.  Makes you want to break out in song. Has some racy moments with language and innuendo jokes, but those should fly over younger kids heads.  This is not like one of those annoying repetitive knock off repeat movies.
B00GII9UCW|4.0|I really like the songs! Most of them I had never heard prior to this. I did think that most of the melodies were the nearly the same.  Another reviewer mentioned that these songs were the same that Don and Phil Everly sang on their album &#34;Songs Our Father Taught Us&#34;. Amazon now has that album, and I'm sorry to say that The Everly Brothers singing these same songs so far outshine Billie Joe and Norah that they don't seem to b e from the same Universe.  Listen for yourself to some songs from each album before making your purchase.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|Disks scratch very easily, which is bad since they are all jammed in there pretty tight.  Most of our discs now skip.  Not the best quality.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|My daughter had this doll but in another style. She liked this one for her cool, pink hair and great new look.<br />These dolls are fun. They are all different with different personallities. Great for play.

B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best book of the series. It has really great moments throughout and really gets the story moving along. Too bad the next book in the series was terrible and should only be read to get to the fifth book.
0316286850|3.0|I wanted to have this book because of the hype that quite a few makeup artists that I know said about it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|After seeing the film, I was interested in seeing how closely the movie followed the written story. As with most films based from novels, there were segments of the book that weren't covered in the film but I felt they captured the poignant moments.<br />I was happy to learn more about the backstory on Panem and how the games were created after the uprising.<br />Overall I really enjoyed this novel and am already starting to read Catching Fire.

B006TZBGBW|5.0|Of course, Judas Priest, the metal Gods are the greatest. This set was a great value at the time and a replacement since all of my original collection are vinyl. Since this came out there have been several sets that have everything except when some joker named &#34;Ripper Owens&#34; tried to sing and sound like King Halford. (I wouldn't want anything he's on in my collection anyway....he is not Priest- so no loss there). Good set of all their older albums.

B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Well done rendition of Carl Sagan's book.  Shows sensitivity to how people will react when this discovery is real.  Once this discovery reached the public, Sagan knows and explains the political actions to follow from fear.  Beat down the discovery.  Hide the facts.  Leave the people ignorant.  Also the religious aspects of such a discovery that such a waste of space is not part of the plan that exists.<br /><br />Jodie Foster gives a memorable performance.

B00632HWOG|4.0|This app is absolutely amazingly easy to use.  There is no way yahoo could of developed a better app than what they have.
B000004747|5.0|One of my favorite CDs of the last few months is the Roland Kirk two-set of “Rip Rig and Panic/Now Please Don’t You Cry, Beautiful Edith”. Kirk’s saxophone playing on these dates is fresh, exciting and endlessly imaginative. I can’t help feeling that his stage theatrics and custom made horns turned off snobby jazz purists to the point of overlooking what a truly phenomenal musician he was.<br /><br />In addition to his excellent sax playing there are loads of stage theatrics making their way into the grooves: fireworks shooting off in the studio at the end of “Rip Rig and Panic”, musique concrete augmenting him on “Slippery Hippery Flippery”, a little comedy on “Why Don’t They Know”, and an endless stream of multiple sax wizardry.<br /><br />When Kirk handles a cover it’s usually an experience to be remembered, case in point his versions of “My Cherie Amour” or “I Say A Little Prayer”. Here, he plays a deconstructed version of “Alfie”, playing it dirgey, then breaking down the notes one by one, then playing it backwards. Crazy as hell!<br /><br />If all of this fails to impress then his showcase of circular breathing on “Blue Rol” where a note is held until your ears turn purple will. This brilliant collection will not disappoint.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Finally! A new book from Stephen King that reads like a real story instead of just an annual churning of formulaic thrillers<br /><br />Great story line and portrayal if the times and people of that era with just enough creepy stuff to keep it King

0385737955|5.0|Like a lot of trilogies, I love the first book, am ok with the second book, and feel let down by the ending.  This book is a great start, but the ending of the trilogy (in another novel) left me wanting more.
B006GKHE6G|4.0|Riptide GP is a standard tilt-to-steer racing game with the major difference being the water front setting. The graphics and the wave physic model are the main attractions. Gotta say - very impressive. On the HTC One, the great graphics looks buttery smooth at default setting. When I maxed it out under the settings menu, the game looked even better and sharper, although I do detect a very slightly drop in overall framerate. The water physics seems pretty realistic and does add to the gameplay.<br /><br />The game does include Flurry Analytics, for those of you who care about it.<br /><br />Overall Riptide GP is definitely an entertaining game - very flashy and great for showing off the graphics of the latest tablet or phone. But after playing about 5 to 10 minutes, I do find myself a little bored as the shock and awe from the graphics start to wear off. For some reason, it's not as addictive as I first thought. But that might be a blessing in disguise, as the game does work your phone's CPU and graphics processors pretty hard and will suck up battery quickly if you're not mindful!<br /><br />Definitely worth checking out as the free app of the day.
006202406X|4.0|*spoiler*<br /><br />I fell in love with this dystopian trilogy.  The first book had me running out to buy the second.  I couldn't wait for book three.  I felt the same way with the Hunger Games trilogy...loved the first two and could not wait for the third.<br /><br />But in both trilogies, the endings left me with an emptiness, not because the series ended, but because the endings had an emptiness.<br /><br />In Mocking Jay, Katniss just isn't a central figure, more of a figurehead.  In Allegiant, while Tris wasn't a figurehead, the story, as with Mocking Jay, left the known area for a new location, rebellions happened against \\"the man\\", and it felt like the trilogy went from being about the female lead to being about other characters, in this case from being about Tris to being about Four.  The first two books were Tris's perspective while the third was shared by Tris and Four.  It just didn't feel the same or have the same connection as the previous books.<br /><br />I still encourage my students to read the trilogy, but more times than not, my students come back with the same comments...the ending was lacking, but it's still a good trilogy.
B00E5N8E2O|5.0|I like Def Leppard and it was great to see them do a show like they did in Vegas where they were able to concentrate on the songs and not have to worry about traveling like they were on a concert tour. They did an excellent job and I hope to see more like this album and CD's. I was also happy to hear some of their early songs that they haven't done in years.
B00BATG18K|2.0|I'm not enjoying the book.  It is not my type of story and is mostly descriptive instead of relating a story.
B00G5G7K7O|4.0|I've seen many reviews that say that this is the best Disney animated movie in a generation. While it was good, it was not the best. Overall it was lacking a bit in story and character development, and the music, while not bad, does not keep up the standards of the best Disney musical animations such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid, or Tangled (the actual best Disney movie of late).
B000N2HCM4|5.0|If you want to really understand Pres. Obama you must read this book by him.  If it was required reading before voting it would have effected the result.
B000002OX7|5.0|This disc is a sonic masterpiece!  It's got a good variety of songs and styles; some humorous, some serious, some poetic, as well as some excellent hard rock!  This is their best album (except for &#34;Tommy&#34;).  The only thing I don't like about it is the  sickening album cover picture; it really pisses me off!
B00GD9F59S|4.0|Sentinel is the last book in the Covenant series beginning right where the fourth book left off. Alex is now recovering from her last fight with Aries and she is left damaged to say the least. Not just her body, but something is not quite right with her mind either. As the days continue they try to do as much as they can to figure out how to take down Aries. Not only that Alex, and Aiden have a few personal problems going on as well. But this will be the end for their whole world as they know it if they don't figure out how to fix things and fast.<br /><br />I really liked this book. But there was just something about it that felt like it was sort of a repeat of previous books. Especially when it came to the Seth, and Aiden thing. But I also loved how we got to see more of Aiden and Alex together. They were beautiful together, and it was so nice to see more of them in this book. Also we got to see more of Alex's previous friends as well. I felt the ending was very sad, and it did leave some questions unanswered. And it didn't really make a whole lot of sense in some ways, but who knows maybe there is another series on the rise that continues with certain aspects from this one. You just never know. But I am sad to see this series end. Over all it was a great ending!<br /><br />More reviews at Shooting Stars Reviews, [...]
B00000099Y|5.0|The first song I heard off of this album about 18 or so years ago, was Stinkfist. I didn't like it at first, but it started to grow on me. Then I bought the album, about 18 years ago, and I sort of liked it but wasn't sure. I was in 8th grade, so I had a young mind. I bought this album in the beginning of the 8th grade semester, and by the end of the 8th grade year, I was a full blown Tool fan. I related this album to the bible (Sorry to offend anyone) because it seemed every time I heard this album, I heard something new, or the album spoke to me in a different way. This was by far the most complex and rich thought provoking album that I ever came across.<br /><br />I didn't like Stinkfist at first, but it became one of my favorites later on. This album took a second to grow on me, but once it did, it never left my cd player, or at least it didn't go far. In fact, the year that this album came out there were a few other master pieces including an awesome one from Rage Against the Machine if you remember back that far.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Spoiler Alert:  I really loved the first two books and couldn't wait to finish the trilogy.  This third book was very disappointing!  The book did not show any closure for Tobias and Tris.  After all they worked for together and their emotional roller coaster, this trilogy deserved a happy ending!  Tris didn't deserve to die a meaningless death.  She should have lived so that she and Tobias could have explored their relationship further and explored the new world they fought so hard to live in.
B008MM9630|5.0|I like it because. it is beautiful and it is nice to play with me I love it very much.......:)
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|This movie has everything intrigue, action humor and a badass Mark Wahlberg. He Ia real American hero with an awesome talent who shows the meaning of justice
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game on my Kindle Fire with my 1 year old nephew. He enjoys the sounds and laughter from the minions and each other. I could play this all day!!!
B0019FWIEQ|5.0|This was a great movie with great acting.  I am glad I purchased it.  I would have liked a different ending, though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The action keeps the story moving without being..overwhelming. Very good story and I look forward to the next book in the series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is really good. I would recomemd u get it. the best thing I love about this game is that u get to change the character you play with.
B00CRMX53S|4.0|Long version -  quite good... took a long time to get it to my computer though - confusing new way to buy it
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I like that I am able to use the device to stream HBO content (YouTube & NetFlix) that I'm watching on my phone or laptop to a television screen. However, the sells and ratings will increase, once the streaming capabilities increase - add more providers; Showtime, STARZ, Cinemax and allow the user to include the personal videos saved to their phone and computer.
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|I just love this app and have used it for the past 2yrs. Grandchildren seem to like it also ; )
0465092764|2.0|The book has very interesting historical tidbits but is poorly organized. The author tends ramble on. I agreed with his premise about string theory before reading the book. I think that the book makes a good case but it is tortuous read.
0141394811|5.0|It is a beautifully written book, and has been recognised as such by none other than Terry Eagleton, who said of Morrissey's prose, &#34; ( it ) is so devastatingly articulate he could win the Booker...Morrissey is now out to demonstrate that he can write the kind of burnished prose no other singer on the planet could aspire to.&#34;<br /><br />Eagleton also infers that &#34;Some of (Morrissey's) bloody-mindedness springs from a damaged childhood. Born into a working-class Irish-Mancunian family, Steven Patrick Morrissey sang his way out of what struck him as a soulless environment, as other working-class Irish Mancunians have written or acted their way out.&#34;<br /><br />Eagleton echoes what many of us think.<br /><br />I am enjoying the book immensely - my only gripe is that the book uses American English spelling throughout, which is irksome when the subject matter is so English. What were Penguin thinking?
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!!  Finished it in a weekend!  I recommend it to all who have just seen Catching Fire and wanted to know how it really ends!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's about time it's available for Kindle.  I'm just glad Amazon woke up.  The game is highly addictive and a lot of fun.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|So motivating.  Easy to read a couple pages or a chapter a day while on the exercise machine for 10 minutes.
B009C7ZQM4|1.0|It didn't do what it said it was supposed to do.  My Kindle fire still runs ULTRA slow.  I am disappointed in my Kindle overall.
B0018BB21G|5.0|One song...&#34; Legend of a Mind&#34;, commonly referred to as &#34;Timothy Leary&#34;...buy this if for no other reason. But the story of the journey of the mind to a better place using only simple focus...forgetting all that is unimportant and embracing the now/here is the whole point of this album. Pinder yet again is the star of this presentation. The mellotron, used by others including the Beatle's John Lennon (the opening of &#34;Strawberry Fields&#34;) is used so well there are times you just won't pick it up except that in your deep brain, you pick it up and it a a pleasure point...musical endorphin. Lots of great extras on this particular release, obsurities, treasures for Moody Blues fans
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BB is awesome. The different rooms make it interesting and working toward complete each rooms challenges makes it competitive either for yourself or a group of friends. I feel the daily rewards are generous and increase as you complete each room. For a change of pace there is a varied slot option again with challenges and awards.<br />You won't get bored and with all the varied awards you'll feel a sense of accomplishment.<br />I've met some wonderful new cyber friends and now we're building relationships outside of BB.<br />I fully recommend this one. You won't be disappointed.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|This one...a whole story in its presentation. Life presented in packaged form. This one features the massive use of the incredible Mellotron, the prime instrument of Mike Pinder. &#34;Are You Sitting Comfortably&#34; is a song I hear in my head at anytime that I feel safe and warm and secure. It may seem a little dated now, but the story of us somehow trying to remember we are far more than a sum of information still seems important to me. Another one of the great presentations by my favorite legacy group. Again, so may extras in this particular package...more obscurities...alternate takes of the songs, different performances...a treasure for all we Moody Blues lovers.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|This is funny and wonderful book - so funny that I kept laughing out loud while reading it. The poems are written in the true spirit of cats and are accompanied by perfectly chosen pictures. It will be much appreciated by anyone who has ever been owned by a cat.
B000GRUS22|5.0|So glad Cretu went back to proper form on this release. No longer &#34;pop&#34;, this is a throwback to his first and second albums. Beautiful vocals...yes I happen to like HIS voice and glad that he didn't bring in a studio voice as he started doing. You know he's back when this album starts with the &#34;horned call&#34; that began his first album years ago. It just works. It takes you to a place of calm pleasure. It's candle lit rooms. being next to your lover and taking in all the senses. It's a little heaven on earth.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It only lets you connect to a few limited web-based services. No access to browser, etc.  $35.00 down the drain for a promising technology!
B0018PJEYY|5.0|Not as loved as &#34;On the Threshold of a Dream&#34; or &#34;To Our Children's Children's Children&#34; or &#34;In Search of the Lost Chord&#34; but loved all the same. Any of the great pre-Pinder departure are pure art. This copy has so many extra tracks is a bargain for that reason only. Obscurities, yes. But if you have the great love of story telling in musical form, this is for you.
B00F8OUBXE|4.0|Music is as good as ever...and Ronnie was born to sing Metal!  Looking forward to the tour...Keeping the Faith, Cat
B005LAIIMG|3.0|I hate to say anything bad about a Brad Pitt movie, so I won't. This a a stand alone movie that has NOTHING to do with the MOST EXCELLENT book. I guess they didn't care much about the reaction of the fans of Max's book. The book was a very well documented telling of the takeover of a virus/epidemic from several viewpoints. This had none of the humanity of what the reality of the book was trying to convey, given the fictional nature of it. This movie is all action. That's it. It IS an edge of your set popcorn movie. The &#34;wrap up&#34; is a clever plot twist. But if you're looking for even a loose adaptation of the book...be aware, the only thing the two projects have in common is title.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Could this get any hotter don't know how you do it but you always get better.PLEASE hurry with the next book I can't wait please don't make us wait so long I need to know where this leads thanks again for letting me go again in to my wonderful world of hot men and even hotter sex
B008JFUNYG|4.0|TERROR!!! Period. And having Sam Rami involved makes it okay with me. I originally resisted this remake. I love the square jawed Campbell too much to betray him, but as he had a part in the production, it seemed okay to take a chance. This one has none of the camp the original had. No spoilers in this review...best to experience it all on your own, from start to finish. Do not watch it alone...terror is best shared with a friend! :-)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Great series! The plot builds up and it's so passionate and well written with greatly designed characters and a world that blows you mind! Definitely a must read series!
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|A real letdown...they change a great cerebral story to a gory mess. This is just a freakin' mess. I can't express how disappointed I was is this and the lame way the story was advanced. I suppose it was just to make sure they made some money riding the 3D craze.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Great series! The plot builds up and it's so passionate and well written with greatly designed characters and a world that blows you mind! Definitely a must read series!

B00EW9GQR6|4.0|This album is overall incredible. For all the Little Monsters out there, this album fills the hole that has been opened for 2 years since BTW. As usal, Gaga writes songs dealing with past sex experiences and drugs along with the imperfections she contains. The songs are not just songs that are put out in the industry to cause a riot of sex. They were written to express the liberation of women and anyone to tell that people are more than just a body. They have an inside to them. No matter what someone tries to do to break that person, that can never possess their love or mind without their permission. Also, Gaga uses references about drugs in this album. She writes about this not because she is a druggie, but because of her past experiences with them. In interviews, she has said in no way that her fans should try drugs because she has tried such things as molly and says it is very unsafe. She is now a recovering addict and is on the road to recovery.<br />Though as a whole I enjoy this album, there are some songs that do not fit me. To me it seems some of these songs were written to fill space in the album. Also, from my point of view as a huge fan, it would be hard for someone who is not a fan of Gaga to enjoy this album. As opinions from friends who have heard me play this album, their reactions are not the best because they don't enjoy most of the songs because they don't understand the music she produces. This album is most certainly an album for her Little Monsters. I would have also appreciated a deluxe version of this album with more songs on it, seeing what songs were possibly cut from this album. Overall, this album is made perfectly for her fans and has a good mix of music and genres. The songs speak, but are missing a certain something in some lyrics.
B00867HDTA|5.0|Full Fat developes some the best games. There games are fairly simple to play but have killer graphics and great repeat playability.

B0007YMUZW|5.0|This is a wonderful album by Ryan, I have yet to be disappointed by any of his music. I received this on time and the packaging was in perfect condition.
B001POX73C|5.0|This book is without a doubt the best Regency Romance I have ever read. Everyone should read this wonderful story. Amazing heroine, I loved her to death, but she is utterly and completely eclipsed by her Hero. I won't give it away, it's too precious, but he is absolutely perfect. I want one. Every girl should have one. I rate a lot of regencies, and there are quite a few that I give high marks to for a variety of reasons, but this book has it all. I am only slightly familiar with Heyer' s work, as I was introduced to this genre in the 90s through Signet and Zebra, and thus have rather worked backwards through the books available on Kindle. So I cannot compare this book to the rest of Heyer' s vast body of work. I can say that this book is easily my favorite thus far amongst all the books I have read. The plot is light, a bit of a romp, but it contains shades of more serious issues and the character analysis that Heyer weaves around her heroine is a work of art all on its own. I did not see the end coming. Oh, I hoped for it, but I did not in a million years believe it would actually happen. Lovers of Rom Com, this is The Book For You! Very very highly recommended for all. Seriously, if you only read one Heyer in your life, read this one.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This movie is wonderful!! Granted it is a little long, but such a wonderful movie that you can't help but to think about days later. This arrived on time and the packaging was in perfect condition.
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|I liked the concept of the film, but it was not as relatable as I would have liked. It had funny moments but some things just did not come across as I am sure the directors would have liked.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very fun game. The graphics are wonderful! It has its down sides though. Such as you need money for everything and can't get it very easily. Love getting to ride it and train it! Shouldn't take so many energy points when training!
B00023BLXK|5.0|I love this movie. Granted it is not as great as the original, but. this one is still good. I was excited to buy it especially when I found it was marked down! This came on time and the packaging was in good condition.

1476729085|5.0|This book has a palpable joy.  My local library had 144 people ahead of me on the hold list, so I was thrilled to get this copy to review.  The characters are quirky, yet real.  The book description didn't jump out at me as something I would like to read, but I figured that this many reviewers couldn't be wrong.  I particularly enjoyed that this was a romance/chick lit type book written by a man with a male protagonist.  Often when men write romances from the point of view of women, I find them lacking.  This one really worked for me, and I look forward to reading more books by Graeme Simsion.  I believe that book clubs looking for a light read would find plenty of things to discuss in this book: Asbergers, abandonment, paternity, non-traditional relationships, self-esteem, etc.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|I grew up watching this; McMillan & Wife, McCloud, etc., but my favorite was always Columbo. I have been afraid that Netflix will remove the series, before I have time to watch them all.<br />I logged on to Amazon and there it was, very nicely priced too. I almost didn't buy it, but am so glad I did.
B000053V7O|4.0|Was interesting movie, but could have used more music and less drama. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie.  Great music.
1592537251|5.0|I checked this book out of the library and hated returning it. I decided to buy my own copy and have enjoyed it immensely. It's a great book to look at and enjoy whenever. So glad Gabriel Campanario decided to put this book together showcasing the drawings of other urban sketchers around the world. As The Seattle Sketcher, his own drawings of Seattle scenes are wonderful and intimate art and can be viewed on his blog.
0316322407|5.0|Very interesting book very informative.  Beautiful girl wise beyond her years.  Unfortunate that a terriost would try to dispose of someone who I predict will do amazing things for her country in the future.  I very much enjoyed reading about her memories and her passion to do good for others.
B00BATG18K|4.0|I am not quite at the end but I am nearly there -- 90%  done. As the title suggests, this is my very first Amy Tan novel, though I had seen the movie Joy Luck Club years ago when it came out.<br /><br />At times, this book has an episodic feel to it. Event after event happens and you don't see it or the characters evolving towards any useful end. Be patient and continue reading; you will be rewarded with insights and see the main heroines change over time.<br /><br />Violet and Lucia are not likeable women in the normal sense. They are a couple of spoiled brats with limited abilities to empathize with others or see anything other than their own desires and impulses. This might make it hard for many women to enjoy the book. However, I think that by writing the characters like this, Tan makes them more true to life. How we present ourselves to the world is not how we really are inside. She allows these two women to speak for themselves in the first person and I think what she was trying to do is write them as honestly as possible -- as they really might have thought and felt -- without regard to presentation to an audience. If there is something to admire in Lucia and Violet it is their will to survive. This is also true to life. It doesn't really matter what we have to do, think or feel, when it comes down to it, we will all do what we must in order to make it safely to the next day and the next. And few of us are content with merely &#34;surviving.&#34; We want as much as we can get. At first I didn't like this portrayal of people -- especially women-people. Now I see that Tan is only telling a human truth. However, the characters DO evolve and by the end you WILL see some gratifying changes.<br /><br />I learned a lot about Chinese culture and attitudes towards women through this book.<br /><br />Interestingly, by learning about Chinese culture, I also learned that in some ways there is not much difference between Western men and Chinese men. The difference is in how much we are willing to put out in the open, not in how the men will behave. I don't think that this was Tan's intention in writing the book, though it might have been. I just couldn't help but compare the characters' experiences to my own life. Maybe there are other women who will do the same thing.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the depictions of sex in the book. I wasn't prepared for the superficiality of these or her crudeness in describing sexual transactions. On the other hand, the way she portrays sex probably fits with the story and people she has written about.<br /><br />Some things remind me of the typical potboiler about courtesans and/or mistresses. Other things go a step or two beyond that. I don't want to be too hard on her for the one or two deus ex machina moments -- as when the women magically find their jewels in a secret hiding place.  All I know is that I wanted to continue to read and so far it has been an intriguing book.
0743579631|5.0|After the first book was hooked and now I can't wait to read all of the books in this series.
B00DYEN5QU|3.0|Henry Cavill was good as a stern and oft times likeable Kal-el/Clark Kent with a natural muscular build. I liked the use of the halogram of Jor-el as his mentor and helper. Hints from the TV series Smallville here. Russell Crowe was amazing as always. I liked that Clark Kent is seen openly using his super powers as a child and an adult. The depiction of Krypton as a used up dark planet with it's citizens having no place to go was a little ironic since they had terra farmed other planets but had left them to die also. Except maybe, Earth? The landscapes and architecture were in sharp contrast to previous films. Superman's costume is dark in keeping with the colors of the planet he came from... no primary red and blue here. Well done. The final battle was a rip off of The Avengers film. This time it was Superman ripping through building after building after building, etc, etc, The final battle was boring and too long. In the end all it took to kill Zod was for Superman to break his neck with a classic head hold and twist of the neck? Really? If I were a citizen of Metropolis, I'd want Superman locked up for destroying the city. At least this time around Lois Lane knows Clark Kent's secret identity.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|The book was amazing!  It deserves a followup.  What has happened since? What other teams have started using the same approach to choosing their players?  Also have payrolls gone down?  It would be good if Michael Lewis would revisit the topic after over 11 years and analyze how baseball has changed with this approach to choosing players.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Sweet, charming, funny, real, honest.  Laugh out loud yet poignant look at human longing to be with another and to belong in a baffling world.
B00FHAB3HW|5.0|So far best album this year. Wide range of catchy pop songs and I have yet to stop listening to it.
B00170DEM8|4.0|Good song and dance routines with a love triangle plot.  First movie with the song White Christmas - it won the Oscar  for Best Song the year after, in 1943.
B005HED08I|4.0|I can't say that I like each and every episode but I do enjoy watching the original Star Trek episodes. This is a science fiction series that was way ahead of its time both in exciting technological ideas for the future and in social acceptance of different cultures. That is both in fictitious cultures and in known  cultures and social roles of the 1960's. Since re-watching it, I now have a few new favorite episodes. I also should add that the quality of the remastering of the classic series is very, very good.
B0089BSOPA|5.0|I'll make this short and spare you the plot,  i'm sure whoever is reading this has seen Halloween 2 a million times. This blu ray looks good. Probably the best Halloween 2 could ever look. I like it because it has a nice case along with cool artwork. Plus you get the TV version on the second disc ( which is sub par all the violence and language is cut out) but nonetheless nice to have there are some extra scenes for enthusiast. Also some bonus stuff...short documentary..filming locations, trailers and a few other things. The only thing that bugged me was the lack of chapters but oh well. I highly recommend this Scream Factory Halloween 2 blu ray.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was super easy to set up and works as stated. It would be great if it were capable of streaming any content instead of specific apps.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|I  learned of this group from a post o received on Facebook off them singing little drummer boy. my jaw dropped at how spectacular they were. I  instantly purchased all three of their albums and will gladly purchase any that they make in the future
B00G32QIEG|3.0|In my opinion the parts you saw in the previews pretty much summed up the best parts of the movie.  I will admit, however, that there were a few pretty funny parts, so it wasn't a complete flop.
0307743721|5.0|I have always enjoyed reading Alice Munro's books. This one may or may not be her last one. Each story is very individual and yet they all tie together. A woman is central to the story in each one along with their loves and their mistakes in judgment. The last few stories are partly autobiographical. If you like reading short stories, this one is a keeper.<br />Lorraine Fox
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Fantastic movie.  Great action, good story line, and fast moving.  Keeps you interested throughout the entire movie.  If you have boys, they will love it.
B002VWNIDG|3.0|This movie us too darn long! It could be a potentially good movie but it's wayyyy too long. I still haven't finished it.
B00G32OER4|5.0|I was very pleased with this movie.  I love movies that are scary due to content and suspense, not gore.  This movie met those conditions.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|boy meets girl in vegas and gets married... ORIGINAL... I wish I could get my money back.  Ive read MANY free books that are better than this one.
B00BSZZA3I|1.0|Doesn't really protect the phone. The red material is already separating and I've only had it for a month. Definitely not worth the money
B00AOVXOQW|5.0|It looks great.  My boys will enjoy many hours playing with this train.  They love construction items and will enjoy this too.  Sounds are good too.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Korean characters are not displayed right.<br />Korean Characters Broken when I wanted to read my e-mails.<br />Could you correct all those display?
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Thanks for making the series available. I like watching one episode after the other while work around the house.  The show is timeless.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, simplistic, addictive.<br /><br />Your standard run, dodge, collect game.  Collect the bananas to purchase new minions, or upgrade specials.  Also contains in app purchases, but doesn't force you to purchase like in many other games to keep up with the competition.<br /><br />You can send challenges to your friends.<br /><br />And they tend to give you updates quite frequently to keep you playing.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|Won't go to Landscape on my Note 3. Looked it up, and it's an issue with this version. There's a pay-as-you-go version that has support but this one doesn't. They should have said something, because I paid for this, and if I'm not in Landscape view, it's pretty much worthless. DO NOT BUY!!!!!<br /><br />edit: and it's official, if you wanted to use as advertised on this product (away from your home network), then it's $1.99 a month or $16.99 a year. So there are hidden costs as well. Do not buy, do not download. Uninstalling right now and clean sweeping my PC, as this feels like malware that I paid for. Cannot give this a negative enough review.
B00GX598FO|3.0|not as good as the first one. It was OK would not go and buy it.Movie you would watch one time
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|Sheer genius!  I haven't laughed so hard in years.  And the illustrations are the perfect counterpoint to her awesome storytelling.
B000XUBFE2|3.0|This was an ok book but certainly nothing really new. Not sure why it got such great reviews. I felt at times it dragged and was depressing. I am a voracious reader so I feel my opinion is valid.
0061950726|4.0|Powerful story of a train heading out west during the early 1900's with abandoned children hoping to find a home and family.
0385528787|3.0|(Spoilers!)After the first two books, I had high hopes for the third installment.  It's been a couple of months since I finished them all and now I think I can say what bothered me about the ending of the story.  It seemed like she almost gave up on the characters. There was so much time spent on developing Jimmy, then he became an afterthought.  Ren seemed to barely be there in the third book as an important character. Toby reverted back to being a teenage girl for most of the book.  Adam just unceremoniously died. The backstory of Zeb was great, but.......I get it that this is a distopian story of the crash of civilization, but I was.......going to shut up now.  I don't like tools and I'm trying not to be one right now.  Overall I did like the series, but wasn't wild about the end, which may have been the goal.
B001HMSFFC|5.0|gorgeous saw 5 times and i can see it more :) if yiu love fashion love feelings sadness happiness meanings of friendship you will love it
B00CATSONE|4.0|If you have Amazon Prime this book is free for you.  If you need something interesting to read for a couple of hours I'd highly recommend it. I never knew Nikola Tesla was as involved as he was in the design of our current electrical grid. There was also a ton of additional interesting information about Tesla if you're interested in him.<br /><br />Even for 3 dollars it'd be an entertaining and rewarding read if you are interested in electricity or Tesla in general.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Cute enjoyable light read.  Fun when one wants to get away from deeper reads.  Nice beach reading material.  Enjoyed it.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought these from Amazon and exactly one year later they quit charging. I put a new battery in them but I still get the same problem. I tried to warranty them but Logitech told me since I bought them on Amazon I have to go through them and the re-sale store they came from. Logitech obviously looks for any excuse they can to void them problems the G-930 has. They did sound great and it's ashame but now they are garbage. Stay away from this product unless you purchase from a Logitech approved vender so you can warranty it. Tons of people seem to be having the same issues.
B000FA5STS|4.0|Excellent book.  Baldacci at his best. Puts the reader on edge for the length of the book.  A quick read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great viewing an addictive. Love being able to watch whole season at once. Reminds me ofliving in England even 40 years after this period not much changed in the people.
B00BKTFABE|5.0|This app is great! Like the title says, not a waste of time. I spend the whole day on this app. Perfect app. Take videos,pictures, great HD graphics. GET THIS APP
B004ZJZQJC|5.0|This movie never gets dated.  It has a clever plot and a lot of action.  Kids love it.  Wholesome movie for kids.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|The show is great, with very comical banter between Castle and Beckett. Good crime solving stories to follow keeps you waiting for the unexpected culprit to the crime.
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Great movie for kids.  Fun and exciting.  Never gets old.  Filed with with action and adventure and keeps kids engaged.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|I like the timing of the games. It gives a reason to go faster.Love it hope to see more of this game.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Would get 5 stars if they did not try to force you to buy in app purchases. The game is very addictive, but now for the real reason you are reading this. For the Iphone you can completely forget about facebook by simply going into settings changing the time a few hours ahead reopening the game, wait a second for full lives to come back, then simply go back to settings and put date and time back to auto.<br /><br />And just like that no more need for facebook!
1451695195|4.0|This book was somewhat hard to follow, but I liked it. My daughter has adopted 3 children, my massage therapist said it was a must read for parents that adopt. I told my daughter about it, she purchased the book and then I decided to get it myself. The last portion of the book brought it all together.
0446572985|3.0|Book was excellent to start out with. An assassin who works for U.S. Government finds himself in a quandary. Something is terribly wrong with his current mission. From there things backfire and he ends up teaming with a super smart 14 yr. old and an FBI agent. Everywhere these 3 turn it all goes to hell. About half way through book I started to lose focus on the story line. The ending with it's contrived White House follies really annoyed me. Just how dumb is everybody who works in government. It was an okay read overall. A little long for this weak story line. I gave it 3 out of 5 stars. If you had to have something to read and this book was around It would be okay to pass time with.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Wish they said how they ended  up, but this was still amazing. This  though  tears to my eyes. Loved it.
B006X08FDA|1.0|Just not my type music.  My husband had seen the Carolina Chocolate Drops on the Marty Stewart Show and<br />thought he would like to hear more of their music.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This book is one that is hard to lay down. Keeps you wanting to see what happens next.It holds your interest all the way to the end. Excellent,
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|My Grandkids love to play with this. It seems easy enough for my youngest Grandchildren to understand and there's enough variation to keep them entertained.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|It is hard to use at first, but to is a lot of fun in the end. I really like this game! I reccomend playing this. Reminds me of burnout for Xbox.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is amazing! The plot is meaningful and sends a clear message to fathers to step up and be leaders and love their family. I love everything about it!
B00BQPEIT2|3.0|I honestly have mixed feelings about this. I really was expecting more from a purchased app, but at the same time, it does have more obstacles that makes the gameplay more interesting, and brought features back from the original Temple Run, whilst having features from Temple Run 2, with an Oz-ish look about it. And this is where is was expecting more. There seems to be more temple run than Oz. In a sense,  was kind of expecting a Sonic the Hedgehog or Crash Bandicoot because it wasn't regular Temple Run. I was expecting a story line that  resembled Oz. And all there was was a map that kinda looked like Oz. More or less, I'm dissapointed.
B00E9ZATJO|5.0|Great movie.  My grandson and I enjoy watching it.  I would recommend this movie even if you've never seen the original Monsters, Inc.  which is also a great movie.
0156027321|3.0|The condition of the book was excellent.  I found it tedious to read so did not get beyond first several pages.  Perhaps I heard too much about the story from movie trailers?
B000W237RE|5.0|This iconic album has an incredible back story and some of the best rock guitar licks of all time. It should be on the top ten list of every serious rock music enthusiast.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I got this game just because it was free on black Friday, but after giving it a try I'm addicted. It's one of the best tower defense games I've ever played.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Hysterical comedy, quick witted humor, excellent writing, brilliant music, fun for the whole family..one you will laugh at again and again.
1476747016|5.0|Very cute book and the illustrations are preciousw.  Definitely written by someone who knows cats.  My mother couldn't put the book down.
B00E9A656K|5.0|I'm not much into cars but this game is awesome. Plus is free, you will enjoy it. Crs is a pretty good game.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|I like anything John writes, It takes a nice twist on Star Trek (the original series) and gets you invested in the action.<br /><br />Greykemp
0802473156|5.0|I loved this book so much I read it in a few hours.  Gary Chapman tells stories of healing relationships through the use of love languages.  Everyone who is in a relationship or getting married should buy this book and read it more than once!  I started using my partners love language and you would have thought the earth stopped spinning on it's axis he was so happy.  It works.  I am giving the book for Christmas gifts this year.  LOVED IT!
B003LQ3YXU|2.0|Just not my thing<br />Pros - It's a classic<br />Cons - Billie Piper is laughing way too often for &#34;serious&#34; stuff they get into. Hard to sell it, despite all the bodies lying around.<br />The Doctor is way too flip/flop. First he has a plan, then he doesn't...etc.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy it.
B0061S073A|4.0|This is a good option for devices that don't have Kindle Free time.  I enjoy being able to limit the apps my children can use without worrying about them getting out of said apps and finding others that they don't need to be using.
B00B32X786|3.0|The story seemed to be about a bunch of guys reconnecting from high schools. Not sure why it's titled beautiful girls. Portman is delightful. Hutton is charming even though borderline creepy. Characters are interesting. Friday night popcorn and movie. Nothing earth shattering. If the writers had tried a little harder maybe.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|One of the best books I have ever read. The characters are very strong  this book brought me into a different world of unfortunate and neglected young boys who grow up as very complicated men.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I thought this was so well done.It was such an enchanting story.I love learning something new about someone like Miss Potter.I have never understood why this movie did very well.Oh,I know why-no gory scenes or bloodbaths.
0307476073|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read!  Inspiring and so well written.  I'd recommend this book to anyone.
B00AJF87QU|5.0|Every song on this album is solid and many are outstanding. After so many great albums, they have up'd their game once more.
B00000G5WJ|5.0|i'm a hugh fan of Famel. The flim in 2009 and the tv show from the 80's. The music is among my favorite cds of all<br />time.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a Samsung S4 and Kindle works perfectly.  Fast downloads, great app with (so far), no problems at all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simply relaxation without boredom. I LOVE this game!  Great game to zone out an collect your thoughts with. I look forward to this game every day.
B009LDCXNY|2.0|I received the DVD and the case was broken and scratched a disk.  I was really excited to give this as a gift, but when my girl opened a broken gift, she was upset.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My husband and I both love this game, as well as our 4 year old!  It runs well and is lots of fun!
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|A more laid back album, but I still love it.<br />Thank you Paramore for making such moving music that's from your hearts.<br />I buy every cd you make!Paramore
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It an a asome game it easy to play my my friends love it and I think it the best game ever.
0060723513|5.0|I've always loved this book.  I just purchased this one to gift to a friend.<br />I wanted hear to read an account of a godliness working through indigenous people in their daily lives.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Yay! I got scribblenauts! I can't wait to play with Maxwell! He's so hot! I want to make hearts, rainbows, and unicorns blah blah blah<br /><br />5 minutes later.......<br />Eh, I'm bored. I'm going to play mine craft now.<br /><br />It's ok, but it gets boring.
B000006UD8|5.0|Great sound quality and delivers all the songs from this classic rock album from one of Rock's early bands.<br />I'm glad this is end my collections.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like solitaire on my computer, with real cards and now on my kindle. When you get bored you can just play it. It's entertaining.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|What great surprise there two albums are.  I discovered this band while watching the Documentary &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34;.  I immediately went on line and purchased the two albums.<br />I hope they release more.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's angry birds so you obviously know how it works. Just get it. It's fun to play. You can go to Christmas of Halloween angry birds too.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What great surprise there two albums are.  I discovered this band while watching the Documentary &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34;.  I immediately went on line and purchased the two albums.<br />I hope they release more.
B00FAI2IUM|4.0|My computer was being weird and didn't let my download this game properly but one of my friends has it on his iPad and it's really fun to play.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Amazing CD! Every song is fantastic and that rarely happens. I really enjoy listening to it and May have found my next favorite band.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Everybody likes Flow Free, and if you don't, you simply don't have any patience. I usually don't have any but I do for this game. Problem solving can sometimes take a while.
B008JFURII|1.0|If I could give this movie a &#34;0&#34; rating, I would. I thoroughly enjoyed the first &#34;Red&#34; movie, and was hoping that &#34;Red 2&#34; would be the same caliber. Was I every disappointed. This movie was awful. The acting was not good. The writing was a joke. Save your money and your time and avoid this movie.
B005HSL626|4.0|Everybody likes fruit ninja, and everyone has probably played it. That's probably because it's free but still, it's fun. :)
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|An excellent film, if you are in recovery you will certainly appreciate this film even more, however there is something in this film for everyone...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well, I'm not the best at this game (my friend got like 5 million as a high score) but I still like this game. It's fun the challenge yourself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love, love, love this game.  Very challenging, many of my friends play it. Passes the time on a cold dreary day in PA!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm sure all of you people already know why I gave this rating. Everyone in the world has probably played Candy Crush at some point. Well I'm over exaggerating but you get the point. It's highly addicting. I didn't get addicted to it but many of my friends did. If only the candy were real.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is a fun app and i like how its connected to the console version as well. Ive been waiting for months to finally play this on the kindle.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It takes a really long time to be come downloaded and after I got bored of it I couldn't really delete it. It frustrated me.
B00GTZJLAK|3.0|Don't expect it to be like Cars; if you do that you will enjoy it more. No real backstory on characters and jumping right into story is a little odd for these kind of movies. Overall a decent movie and the kids enjoyed it and that's all that matters.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I liked the first temple run and I like the second temple run too. That's not to say that I'm good at it, but it's fun to play and if you're friend has a amazon device, you can compete against each other at the same time and see who dies first. I do that with subway surfer also.
B00007GZR5|1.0|This movie has a good plot but the acting is overdone.  It is silly and hard to get through.  I'm glad that I've seen it but won't again.  The one good thing about the movie are the sets and use of color.
B009O2XY12|2.0|No more levels available on my Kindle, but a lot more on my iPhone.  I have tried to delete and reload, but nothing changes. Very disappointing!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Was supposed to be for my sister, but I've found it's addicting and fun! Great for all ages! LoL :)
B00EEL0LGY|5.0|Completely by accident but I love it already. Awesome graphics easy to play and easily upgradable vehicles. I know I will be addicted to .<br />this one
0143119680|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one. It's a fascinating blend of history and magic. A journey for an unwilling witch and her Vampire.
B00GBCMW9S|1.0|This is wack as ever I have downloaded free mixtapes better than this and I was charged $15 I need my money back refund please
B002DS3982|1.0|Once I received the movie in the mail it Wouldn't play I'm very disappointed wanted to return but it woul have costed me more
B004J4WNL2|3.0|One or two interesting ideas smothered in hyperbole and anecdote.  Unfortunately, this seems to be the model of most contemporary nonfiction.  Found this one particularly tedious, and better suited for a New York Review of Books article.  The implications for early and intermediate childhood education are, however, substantial.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it!<br />I have read this book at least three times! The characters, plot....so good. Suzanne Collins is a great author
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a nifty little program to clear unused items from memory. Works very well and has an excellent interface.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|Classic miniseries something you will watch again and again. Very well done. All the spin offs all the sequels or prequels were no match for this one as its simply the best and the others can't hold a candle to it.
B00BAXFAJC|5.0|This novel, written, in the fine English tradition of Trollope, unfolds like a lovely floweer. Almost every page provides a present to the reader who loves to garner quotations and scenes of power. I highly recommend your attention to this lovely work of art.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Unfortunately...now it is a time waster! Uh oh! But it is good and I haven't figured everything out yet but it seems pretty nice.
B002LITSE8|5.0|Richard Matheson's dark, apocalyptic vision of a world devastated by vampires remains one of the most powerful horror novels ever written.  It's short and, trademark Matheson, concise, yet still so powerful.<br /><br />Matheson makes vampires weirdly believable, and though I'm no scientist (one of my poorer subjects), this book puts you on the inside of Robert Neville's studying vampires from a scientific perspective, all the while trying to comprehend that he is, in fact, dealing with a legend.  Vampires are legend.  Yet he is the last remaining human on Earth; the rest is vampires.  Real, traditional, frightening and eerie vampires.<br /><br />Reading this book, no one should expect anything like the movie, which pales greatly in comparison to this book.  In this book, the vampires actually are vampires.  They can talk and are highly intelligent, and hang around Neville's house, screaming at him to come out, which to me was so haunting compared to anything from the movie.  And this tale has such a powerfully dark, but very real sort of statement that it will leave you thinking deeply about it for a very long time, and the title, I Am Legend, makes all the more sense than the movie's take on it, as well.<br /><br />Matheson is a horror legend, and Stephen King calls him his greatest influence.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I LOVE THE WALKING DEAD. Whenever i finished watching Season 3 I almost died when I figured out that Season 4 wasn't out yet. I found this here, it's a great service. Please continue.
1476727651|5.0|Somehow, after so many years, Stephen King was able to return to a character from his third novel, The Shining, and breathe life into him flawlessly.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep follows Danny Torrance as an adult, and he is an extremely real, dynamic, and likeable character.  Stephen King's ability to craft those kinds of characters has amazed me since the first book I read by him, and those who think he has lost his touch are terribly wrong, and are plainly missing out.  This book is filled with great characters, and even the villains are hard not to like.  I loved Abra, the young girl Danny comes across and who has a shining brighter than anyone has ever seen; I loved Danny--well, I guess I should get used to calling him Dan, since he's all grown up now--and found myself really caring and invested into him; I loved how dark the villains in the story were, even though their storyline wasn't nearly as interesting as that of Dan's and Abra's.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep can be read as an independent novel, but I think it should be read more as a sequel to The Shining.  Or... not so much a sequel, but a sort of sistering novel that is also a continuation of the character, Dan Torrance.  I fell in love with this book and had to restrain myself from reading it all in one night because I wanted to draw it out.  It may not be as scary or classic as The Shining, but it's still a fantastic read, deeply affecting, and in some ways, quite powerful.  The single problem I could find with it was that i thought the return to the Colorado setting could've been done up a bit more, but it had a concise and smooth feel to it even so.  And also, fans of the Shining will be delighted with the various nods to it found in this book, as are to be expected.
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|It's a great movie of course!<br />It skipped a couple of times and the little teeth that are in the middle- one of them were broken when i got it. So maybe be more careful when delivering?
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|No jazz collection is complete without this iconic Brubeck album; one of the best and greatest performances by one of America's most notable jazz pianists and arrangers.
B0084TWN9K|4.0|The author is a master at laying out story lines and then not overdoing by telling a story, she &#34;shows&#34; the story.
0891419063|5.0|This is an absolutely great book and I would highly recommend to one and all.  This book gives you a down to earth point of view from a Marine who served in the Pacific.
B00GP0G0IK|3.0|fun, but when I got the free version,  I thought it was the whole game....apparently not.  the game gets interrupted with too many ads and it glitches quite a bit too.
B00026WU64|5.0|The classic we know and love, in a clear great-sounding remaster. Nothing radical as far as the remaster is concerned, it just sounds terrific.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|It is so addictive, I play on it for hours and hours even my little sister wants to play on it. But I must warn you now it is a little bloody but not to terribly bad a all I say it is  AMAZING.
B00DW1WR14|5.0|Hard to believe it's been more than two decades since 10. I f you love PJ, likely you've already got this. If you don't care about them, I'm not gonna try and change your mind.
B006P0FIB0|5.0|Loved this non-stop modern take on the old tale.  Mostly you get to witness the actors having the time of their lives as all good productions of the story have afforded us in the past all the way back to Gene Kelly and Lana Turner et al.  Orlando Bloom and Milla Jovovitch are the biggest names aboard stateside and both are no strangers to the action film genre.  The old tale has been told in every possible fashion in its many many film incarnations and so Paul W. S. Anderson (known mostly for the Resident Evil franchise) takes it in the pure action and fun direction of the modern cine-plex blockbuster and obviously has a heck of a time doing it.  For a period piece it's fun to see the formula applied to the ultimate buddy pic.  I found the 3D really added to the overall enjoyment of this particular movie when it does not to many others released these days.  Milla Jovovitch is a joy to behold and Orlando acquits himself very well but neither over shadows their fellow actors in this brisk and bawdy boisterous adaptation.  I had fun at the movies again and these days that's as rare as a good story.  The picture and sound are equal to the task on both the Blu-Ray and The Blu-Ray 3D.  In short, if you are a fan of Dumas' novel as I am and have seen all the productions done then this particularly frantic version is a worthy addition to your collection.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Hey, wow, I was surprised, frankly, at how well this works. Easy interface, simple to actually *use*. A must if you've got Prime.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Rarely does a retro-fit add anything.  So the big question is: does it substantially add to the viewing experience of one of the most beloved blockbusters of all time?  The answer is a resounding YES it does.  It opens it up immensely and it brings you into the proximity with the T-Rex that you dived under your seat to avoid in the theater not to mention the Raptors (shudder).  I love this version.  It's like seeing the movie again for the first time and refortifies Spielberg's genius for the big canvas.  Money well spent.  Rare today.  I hope I answered the big question for you and I urge you to experience this new Jurassic Park before it fills up and the long lines wear you out.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Near complete fail, whether close or far from my wifi connection. I was so excited for this product, I purchased (pre-ordered) TWO of them. So disappointed... the streaming stalled, stuttered, and generally didn't work at all. I promptly returned both of them. Looking at purchasing a &#34;smart&#34; TV instead... seems to me the technology/price point to justify this is good.
0767827902|5.0|An American masterpiece of the first order.  Peter Bogdanovich suffered the Orson Welles syndrome - making his masterpiece first and then falling slowly down the Hollywood ladder to his current oblivion without achieving Welle's stature as 'autuer' and seemingly has a sub conscience awareness of the fact since he wrote one of the definitive biographies of Welles himself (In all fairness - I'm sure he'd disagree with me).  The Last Picture Show is a magnificent piece of American story telling and has to be seen to be explained or understood.  This version brings a genius vision into sharper focus. So with no further ado I urge you to buy it and watch it.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|This is my favorite version of miracle on 34th street<br />Richard Attenborough makes you believe just like when I was a child<br />and I loved the way the two lovers played the their parts I cry every time I watch him propose to her.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|What a movie!  Didn't find it's audience at the time, but then Tarantino wasn't the household name he is now (he wrote it).  Tony Scott directs and he knows his way around an action movie.  But the core is pure Tarantino and the ensemble cast is to die for.  Gandolfino in probably the first of his reluctant hit man performances and a list of ensemble (A-List) actors too long to name.  One cannot overlook Brad Pitt however in what has to be the cameo of a lifetime.  Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette acquit themselves admirably throughout the mayhem that ensues from their theft of five million dollars worth of Mafia street product.  Wild and unpredictable it's a thrill ride to the very end.  The blu-ray looks great and the sound is even better.  I didn't notice anything really added to the Director's cut but the blu picture justifies the upgrade. I highly recommend!!
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|This is a great addition to the Pendergast series. It was good to see corrie return. Her educational interests are interesting given her first appearance.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These three books kept me hanging on until the very end. I recommend them to everyone especially the last book.
B0001CCY7E|5.0|I loved the movie, and that may have a lot to do with how much I enjoy this album. It takes me back to the incredible beauty of vistas of untouched land in America and a sense of what it once was. John Barry is so good I sometimes forget and think James Horner (my favorite movie track composer) did this. John Barry is at the top of the game in this one.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Give it time to warm up. It's worth every moment in time you spend engrossed in it subtlety and brilliance.
B002E2M3KM|3.0|NOTE: I'm adding one star and editing this review after a little tweaking. I'll put my additional comments at the end:<br /><br />Original review: My two-stars is for the vinyl press, not the music. The songs are fantastic. They vinyl is horrendous.<br /><br />I was immediately concerned when I saw the album cover. The artwork looked grainy and washed out. I pulled out my old original press and I was right. It is less vibrant. It is more grainy looking. Like it was re-printed from a low resolution image. Not good.<br /><br />So then I put the record on and was immediately let down. This is not a high quality 180g pressing. I have some great pressings of older albums. U2 Joshua Tree, Kraftwerk Digital Remasters, Miles Davis, and others. Those albums sound incredible. This one does not.<br /><br />It started off with pops and clicks that I don't even hear on some of my 50-year-old Columbia six-eye pressings. It's definitely not a quiet piece of vinyl. Then as the music started something didn't sound right. I played it back to back with my not-so-great shape original and realized that this new press sounds like the stereo field has been squished into the middle. Not as open. Not as lively. The mix also sounds different. For example, on \\"We Will Rock You\\" the original press the vocal is about the same level as the stomp, stomp, clap. However on this press, the vocal is pumped up higher. I realize the whole thing has been compressed. ARGH! Why do they have to do this? Louder is not better.<br /><br />The result of the compression is that the dynamic range is destroyed on this vinyl. It is somewhat fatiguing to listen to because it lacks the separation and space of the original. Loud songs like Sheer Heart Attack sound a complete mess with everything compressed together. And there is distortion.<br /><br />The overall result is an album that sounds thinner, flatter, more distorted, and far less enjoyable to listen to than the $1,00 swap meet original press I have. It's louder though if you like that.<br /><br />I don't think I can even keep this thing. It is a very poor listening experience.<br /><br />EDIT: Trying to give this record all the love I can because I really want to love it.<br /><br />First, I gave it a nice bath in my Spin Clean to get rid of any static and possible dust that my brush couldn't pick up. That lessened the pops and clicks a bit, but they're still there a little more than I'd expect from a new 180g press.<br /><br />Next I adjusted my EQ, which is a bit disappointing because I have pretty much found a sweet spot on my system that I hardly ever have to mess with at all. My system consists of a Pro-Ject Genie RMP 1.3 turntable, run through a vintage Yamaha R-300 receiver, Kenwood Graphic EQ, and some vintage Pioneer and Panasonic speakers, with a Polk sub. This system sounds great to me on my vinyl collection of nearly 1200 albums. When I put on this record, I left all the settings the same as I have for pretty much all the other vinyl I play. It just sounded ugly compared to the original press at the same settings. So I bypassed the EQ, and adjusted the \\"loudness\\" on my receiver to the \\"flat\\" position so that it is not boosting any mids. The sound improved quite a bit. There is still some distortion which just sounds like they mastered it at too high a level. The thing that bothers me is they obviously EQ'd the crap out of it when they mastered it, and then boosted and compressed the audio. At least I can bear to listen to it now and I'll keep it.
B008JEJN8O|5.0|I like these much better than the original.  I have been wearing them even out in the snow, they have much better traction.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|great book, non stop action. Keeps your attention and on the edge of your chair. I think it's Baldaccis best yet.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I have really enjoyed this book. It gets my psychological gears turning at 21.298462 miles per hour. The only negative thing is that at some points it theologically defies thousands of years of theological teaching when making reference to the act of procuring the genius of other beings without consultation. But other than these flaws, it has an impact. This is a good read for those in the adolescent or above years due to the potential misunderstandings of the ones in the \\"larval\\" stage (the youngsters) and direct reference to psychological thievery. My thanks to the author, Austin Kleon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Well as you see this game is totally of the hook you should definitely try and download this app<br />And I recommend you to take care of the horse
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I think this is a fun bubble game. Challenging. It got better the longer I played. Very fun. I enjoyed it a lot. I recommend it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the first book. The second book wasn't so great to me, so I held off of reading the book until I saw the second movie and it reignited my flame. I'm happy I read the third book. It is sssoooooo good. A must read.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I play this game all the time.  love solitaire. this is the best one I have found so far on my Kindle
1451695195|5.0|fabulous story about the possibility of afterlife, the existence of God and angels and where we will go when we die. Would recommend this book to anyone who is skeptical about life after death.
B00DNB9RXO|4.0|This game is an awesome concept. IT has easy controls and is challenging. But, I don't feel that it was designed as it was thought.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Like the movie, I was hoping she would have been more heroic at the end, but over all nice movie.
B0055QYKQO|4.0|Good board. It's very fast, and in combination with a sata III sd, the computer really sings.  no more waiting for ten minutes to power up, and everything loads and runs instantly.  So far, very reliable (I've had it for about 6 months).  My only regret is that it is a full size ATX and not a mini board.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I thought of Downtown Abbey 50 years earlier, without the grandeur of the Abbey.  A duke who was unloved by his parents during childhood and is ashamed of many of his father's actions falls into a rocky romance with a woman who was a child chess genius.  The duke was unloved as a child because he was a pawn between his rich non-noble mother and his mean spendthrift father. The woman was the daughter of the 5th son of a lessor nobleman.  Her father was a chess master, but a scammer as well.  the father got caught, blamed his 12 year-old daughter, but went to jail anyway.  There are some interesting pictures of the British justice system at the time.<br /><br />After the couple got married, the sex was quite explicit.  If would be good if there were also a teenager version so that they could learn from the rest of the story.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Highly addictive. Fun. I really like to finally have this on my kindle. It is about time. Thank you, kindle.
0689829590|1.0|Was in horrible condition even though it was described as in good condition. There are scribbles all over the inside of the book, it makes me mad that I paid for this book at all.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What a story teller.  Within ten pages I, he had me hook, line, and sinker.  I could visualize the town as if I had lived there for years.  This is the best of the best.  I would only strongly recommend you not start reading in the evening before a work day.  You will not be able to put this book down.  If I could give it more than five stars, I would.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Great game, scary idea, but what a great game! So addicted! Have it on my phone too. I play it at work, when I'm at lunch. Play it all the time. This game is a must get!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read it in two days during law school exams. That should tell you something. Read it. You will not be sorry.
B001P7HUF0|3.0|If you are looking for a movie based on a John Grisham novel, this movie will suffice to pass the time and keep you moderately engaged. Unless it's the first time you've ever seen a movie of this genre, don't expect to be spellbound. I was hoping for more, since the movie was made by Coppola, but was left disappointed. It's one tired cliche after another, delivered with alternate doses of hammy and tepid performances. This must have been a quick buck for everyone involved, cheap to shoot and a guaranteed box office return. It definitely feels like it was mailed in, perhaps to satisfy contract demands? Yawn.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|Very clever poems (some rhyming, some free verse) that capture the essence of what being a housecat is all about.  Some cute photos, too.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|this item works as intended, well made, functions properly. good level of comfort fairly cheaply priced wont need to replace any time soon
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the last book less than the other two.  The book was good, but the other two were great. It just seemed a little boring and dragged out abut half way though at times, then picked up again. 2nd book was my favorite of the series.
B00632HWOG|1.0|App keeps closing.  I can no longer use it on my Fire. It worked fine for years, then after the last update it stopped.  Yahoo sports app no longer works too.
B004P02OJ6|5.0|very plausable.  I could seem myself in that situation.  Nothing takes place that was super human, could happen in real life.
B007R11DKQ|3.0|This was better than expected. Robert De Niro was great fun. This was an entertaining fantasy movie for the whole family.
B00E8S2GJI|5.0|More than enough has been said on here and on countless other sites about this film and all of the LOTR films so I won't bore you with details. But I will say this: if you are a fan of The Hobbit then the EXTENDED version of the film is the version of the film you MUST buy. Do the scant 13mins or so of footage add that much to the storyline? Nah. Not really. But do the extras on this set more than make up for whatever the film might be lacking in someone's opinion? Absolutely. The producers on this Blu ray set do an INCREDIBLE job of presenting the viewer with amazingly well done documentaries that cover every aspect on the making of this film. It's almost mind-numbingly exhausting to go through all of the features but I have done so and I am here to tell you: BUY THIS SET! The docs alone are worth the price of admission. Video and audio are top notch on both the 2D and 3D versions. I've seen this movie 4 times since I've purchased the Blu ray and I must say that it's replay value is very high. Great film. Even better Blu ray set.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|This was the weakest of the Scarpetta novels (& I've read them all).  This book lacked the complexity and smooth writing style normally demonstrated by Cornwell.  Instead, the reader is bored with superfluous and redundant descriptions (see how annoying that is ?!).  The plot was completely disjointed and very disappointing.  I question if this truly was Cornwells work or the work of a ghastly ghost writer ???  Save your money.
B00E4W40C4|4.0|This is an extremely solid and well made film that truly deviates (at least until the last half) from all the previous XMEN movies in tone and content. For those expecting non-stop action and a barrage of mutants, this isn't your film. But for those looking for a film with well made action sequences and a solid story line, give this a spin. The film is not without its faults. But what film isn't? Fans of the series should get a kick out of this film which has a nice scene at the end that nicely sets up the upcoming new XMEN movie. The video and sound quality of the film are all top notch and even though the Unrated version doesn't really add all that much to the movie I do prefer it over the PG-13 version and it's more ideal then watching the rated version in 3D (which is a useless conversion) or 2D. 8/10
B00571F26Y|5.0|Full of information and answered a lot of questions that I have concerning my daughter's health.  Great book for everyone.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I agree with the last customer's review!  I had always really liked Pink Floyd's distinct signature on atmosphere and mood.  But catching a live show would be an almost religious experience.  Of course, those iconic tours are only a lucid memory.  But with this DvD I slip into the other universe that only Pink Floyd delivers.  I really feel David Gilmour helped steer the band into more upbeat creative waters with the release of The Division Bell.  Roger Waters is a genius with lyric for dark,  brooding and anxious.  But wouldn't let the bandmates contribute anything outside his stream of thought.  That being said, I can't get over how poor the audio/video transfer to video is.  Especially for a band that is so meticulous and were not pressed for time.  Anyway, everything else is spot on! The light show and song order with the huge projector visualizations is amazing! If you don't smoke cannabis and want to but can't?  Put this DvD on with the lights off and let the show do the rest!.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I really enjoyed this game!  It wasn't difficult for me to figure out how to play and each time I played didn't take much longer than roughly half an hour (on casual, anyway), which is near perfect for a lunch hour time-waster.  I found myself grinning evilly every time I hit the world with whatever newly-evolved parameters I'd introduced to my plague, lol.  Definitely worth the money spent.
B0026P3G12|5.0|A truly beautiful voice.  Susan Boyle is the &#34;Cinderella of Music&#34;.<br />She touches emotions in you with her voice that you never knew<br />you had.  It's magic.
B00CHVJI08|5.0|Watched this with my 10 year old.  It was a hoot!  Lots of jokes for me as well as him (though my favorite was the slapstick taking of photos).
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Beautiful music. You should see the youtube video of the piano guys doing the first song before you buy it. You will be excited. Great Christmas album.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I will be able to write a better review after I apply what I just read. I plan to start now.
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|One of the great live albums - incredibly tight performances. It's also worth getting even if you have the studio recordings. Unlike many live albums from the 70s, the live versions bring new dimensions to these songs. And the price can't be beat. A no-brainer for lovers of 70s soul and r&b.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King! I'm not sure if I can convey how much I enjoyed reading this book?He's an amazing storyteller,and truly the master of suspense! Finally getting a look at Danny after all these years is like revisiting an old friend you've forgotten about. I will always be your constant reader Mr. King. Thank you for another wonderful book!
B000001E3V|2.0|I love the studio album, but to be fair, I'm not generally a huge Clapton fan. I respect his playing more than I enjoy it. This live album falls far short of the studio recording in my opinion. The jams just sound like noodling. Compare this to the Allman Brothers Fillmore album - long jams that actually go somewhere.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|I am a huge Kanye West fan. I know a lot of people that don't like his music because they think he is arrogant, but I think his arrogance is well-deserved. He has made the most interesting and best hip-hop music for a decade now. His last album was introspective and incredibly honest. It made for great music. This album is a huge step back. The lyrics are weak, and, in many cases, stupid. For example, claiming to be a god and then calling himself a man of god in the next line makes him sound like an idiot who doesn't understand his own religion. Also, the 300 were Greek, not Roman. There are a couple of good songs on Yeezus, but I expect more from a Kanye West album. I expect greatness, and for the first time, he didn't deliver.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|just love this game !!!!! almost sold my kindle, because i couldnt play my fav game. Now iam a happy candy crusher
B00EVW0SA0|4.0|This is one ridiculous movie but it is fun to watch from the beginning to the end.  It is action packed and I loved it!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I like playing mist times; however, when I am stuck on a level fir weeks, I am ready to quit.  I also don't like when several &quot;friends&quot; send lives and the game only gives me a few.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Uno!This game brings the classic game of cards straight to your mobile device.Not only that,but you can actually play it with no struggle.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I thought it wa brilliant.  Follows the book pretty well.  Not easy to produce a film following the  characters over hundreds of years.<br />Casting worked very well.  Tom Hanks always comes through and Halle  handled the part with ease.  I'm not a critical movie viewer and just like to enjoy most of the time.
0385504225|3.0|Not an easy read but if you like Dan Brown you will like this book. Not much too say  about this, sorry
B007VDN1PA|4.0|I used this to convert over 500 slides to digital. It works well, but some of slides came out dark or blurry. It seems that if you don't put the slide in just right, it won't focus across the whole picture. However, the dark ones were easily fixed on my computer. Also, some of my slides fit very tight, had to use tweezers to remove them. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to convert their old home slides to digital, but if you need high quality conversions, you will have to spend more for a better unit. That being said, for my needs, I personally am very satisfied with it's performance.
B0036EH3U2|1.0|This is a terrific Britcom, but some of the British humor may be lost on American audiences. Just like Fawltey Towers though.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this hook down, writer really engages you with his style of writing. The concept is not as far fetched snout sounds and it's a definite nod to environmental issues and what we could be faced with if we continue at the pace we're at.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|Dr. Panda Apps speak for themselves.  The graphics are so amazing and the things you can do with them.  My grand-daughters love this restaurant app.  You prepare the food and serve it to your animal guests.  Then you wash the dishes and recycle.  It is just a cute app.  Highly recommend.  I liked it so much we ended up upgrading it and the girls just love it.
B007R108WA|4.0|Well done movie, just such a macabre subject it is difficult to bring about the smile that invokes 5 stars!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|This is such a cute movie. Definitely more of a chick flick but something I could watch over and over. The singing is great and pretty catchy too.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I really thought I would get some small walker aquarium that would look somewhat like the picture, but be disappointing.  When I opened it, was I surprised!  The aquarium is overall 9 1/2 Tall x 6 W x 4 1/4&#34; Deep!  The tanks themselves measure 2 15/16&#34; Tall x 5 3/16 W x 2 3/4&#34; D.  It is of very sturdy construction with each tank being illuminated by 3 LED's.  The switch is cleverly disguised as the &#34;3&#34; in Season 3 on the front.  The walker heads are very detailed & have a spring & clip mounted into the back of them.  Each tank has appropriate cutouts for the hangers so you'll know where to put them.<br /><br />As 1 previous reviewer wrote, there are tiny nubs in the separate compartment in the rear that is designed to hold the DVD/Blu-ray discs.  I tried inserting my season 3 disc book & did not notice any tracks being left by the nubs (designed to hold the disc book in place).  However I store my DVD's in a rack so most likely I will not leave them in the display.  The unit takes 4 AAA batteries that are easily installed/removed via removing a set screw & door on the bottom.  Each tank has a press on lid that should contain the water nicely (I have not tried any water in the display to this point).<br /><br />When I unpacked it, all I kept saying was &#34;WOW&#34;!  The display & heads were made by McFarlane Toys and as usual look fantastic.  The only thing I saw that disappointed me slightly was that they did not detail the eyes of the walkers at all - just left them blank (for those that still have eyes).  I would Highly Recommend this as a gift for any true Walking Dead Fan!!!
B00A2DIW3C|5.0|I haven't read much military related history accounts usually being interested in sci-fi material.  this story is captivating being about the engineers and scientists that  played a tangible role in shaping the world we live in today with the international powers that exist as they are.  very fun read.

0399159347|5.0|Great book: entertaining, enticingly written, and few 'dead' spots. It's an intriguing story plot: discovering a husband's letter that's intended to be read only after his death and fighting one's conscience about whether or not to read it immediately. As a reader, I was reminded that secrets are not meant to be violated.
B00BIR381W|5.0|I watched this show from the beginning. and when its on break  I started at season 1 and watch a few episodes a week until it restarts. its nice to rewatch and notice clues I missed the first few times
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Both of my adult children recommended this game to me. It is great fun no matter what age one is.
0767817478|5.0|watch this movie all the time. its a great classic. acting was great and the special effects are amazing.  best movie that matthew brodrick made.

B00BUADSMQ|4.0|love me some die hard. I was surprised how john's catch phrase from the previous movies was missing. I didn't enjoy the i'm on vacation he said over and over. and the guy playing jack was awful. if they make another they need to leave jack out or find someone who can act
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|This was a gift for my Mother and I can say this was a PRICELESS gift.I have watched several of the episodes and I now will say &#34;just one more thing&#34;everytime I walk out the door.I also must add that the homes used in the shows are HUGE MASTERPIECES like I have never seen.Absolutely beautiful.Columbo always figures out the criminal in every case.He is different but he hits the nail on the head everytime.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|Great book enjoyed the read.  More about life than cooking but that's the way it should be. Slow down, cook and enjoy yourself.
1451695195|4.0|Proof of heaven and the afterlife is sought by most everyone in anticipation of its experience.  The book's title draws us to it in hopes of finding  the answer.  While real proof from the book can be questioned, it describes a somewhat startling and hopeful journey in getting into heaven and eternity.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I PLAYED this game forever so glad when it came out for phone! But hopefully<br />mojang will add in commands and Survial to creative visa versa
B00BATG18K|3.0|Wasn't one of her best novels and I'm a major fan of Amy Tan. I was waiting so long for a new novel from her and was disappointed. I felt it drag a bit and that's not usually what I get from her writing. There's always next time.
031623480X|2.0|I didn't realize this was a low carb diet book--I expected more of a scientific exploration of diet (specifically wheat) on brain development.  Like Gary Taubes (Why We Get Fat), this author chooses some studies to support the high fat/high protein/low carb connection, and then recommends everyone should change to that way of eating.  Personally, I find it too darn expensive (and time consuming) to eat the high protein/high fat (and often supplement-enhanced) diet the book recommends.  Anecdotal evidence amply demonstrate this diet works for some people, but there is an equal amount of anecdotal (and science-backed) evidence that  a diet high in fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains, with protein derived from plant and animal sources can also fuel healthy bodies, and in a much cheaper and more environmentally friendly way.<br /><br />I like that the book recommends exercise as a key component to brain health, and suggests exploring meditation.<br /><br />I feel this is a fad diet book, and not much more, thus my two star rating.  I think different people find satisfaction and health eating in different ways and to promote an expensive and rigid plan as the answer for everybody is a mistake.<br /><br />How I got this book: won it in a contest.  This review reflects my honest opinion.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|There's not a lot more to say about Allie Brosh because everyone is already talking about her and how amazing she is. She wins Teh Internets on a daily basis. Read her book.
1250030951|3.0|This was a fun read. I don't at all regret choosing to spend my time reading this instead of reading actual fanfiction.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that a book about a fangirl focused so little on her online friendships, though. There are offhand mentions throughout the book -- &#34;Oh, yeah, I found a beta reader in Brazil&#34; -- but we never meet any of her fandom friends. The book focuses entirely on her in-person relationships, which I found odd in a story that's supposedly about what it means to be a fangirl. Seeing as I personally have met some of my closest friends in fandom, and feel more comfortable spilling my heart out to some of my fen than most of the people I know IRL, I would have liked more examination of her daily online activities and how they impacted her as a person.<br /><br />But the characters were interesting and sympathetic, the love story was cute, and some of the dialogue made me laugh out loud. It was a good way to spend an evening, curled up in bed with a cup of tea.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is cool. If you lose don't worry you still win money. You get to upgrade your robot. Awesome game. Good luck!
B0053O89WY|2.0|This series was hilariously funny at first, but as time has gone by it's turned away from the sci-fi humor and gotten more an more obsessed with the characters' love lives. I want more Schrodinger's Cat jokes; I don't care who they're sleeping with! I watched part of this season with my little brother, and it was so crude I found myself embarrassed to be showing it to him. Will not be watching any more of the series.
B00CDTSQZW|4.0|To be honest, I don't know a whole lot about the Nordic/Norse/Pagan culture, other than the Vikings tended to make their living off of raiding and pillaging other villages.  In today's terms, that would be called &#34;a rash of violent burglaries.&#34; and &#34;theft.&#34;  How those of that descent today consider that honorable is highly questionable to me.  And let's remind ourselves what theft means.  Taking that which is not yours without fair compensation.  One cannot compare that to today's oil market, as trust anybody who buys gasoline, that the oil is not &#34;stolen.&#34;  If anything, it's over-paid for.<br /><br />But forget all that.  HISTORY's &#34;Viking&#34; series is quite good so far.  Well acted, seemingly good plot, good costuming, excellent set being Ireland (which I find odd, as I was unaware that Ireland had Jorge-like land formations.)
0375714839|4.0|Iran is one country I wish I knew more about. This comic gave me a good introduction into the revolution, the current political situation over there, and how it feels to the people who have lived through it. But something about the book (the stark black-and-white artwork? the blunt and straightforward writing style?) left me emotionally a little cold. I didn't feel deeply invested in the characters.<br /><br />At any rate, I'm so excited to see a comic book written by a woman from the Middle East. It was a new and eye-opening perspective for me, and I hope many others like it are published in the future.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A very insightful and simple method for being your best and dealing with life's challenges.  Short, simple and to the point.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best books I have read in some time, a true page turner that  keeps you pulled in till the end and more, so much more than the movie could ever hope to be.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I love having the complete series.  Its fun to watch the commentary sections on each DVD.  Each show is the full cut, including scenes that may not show during a 30 minute tv broadcast.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Let me start by saying I have never seen the TV show so this is strictly about the book.  I really wanted to like this book.  While I felt that the discussion of the relationships she developed in prison was interesting and at times heartwarming, I felt that in general the book was a lost opportunity. As I read the book I kept waiting for there to be a greater point that never came.  It felt that the over thesis, if you will, of the book was never really flushed out which leaves (at least this) reader feeling like something was missing.  I think the greatest injustice of the book in terms of lost opportunities was that she spent so much time talking about the wonderful relationships, recreation activities and down-time for reading that I thought &#34;hey, prison doesn't sound so bad!&#34;  That is NOT the take-home message she was hoping for I would assume, but that fact remains that it is the picture she painted.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Bad word and such but really good for mythology nerds! I thought it would be stupid but I was wrong!
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|it crashed my kindel and I couldn't get into it for a long time. don't get this game not worth it.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Fun movie, no problems streaming it in HD via Amazon Prime for Free.  Watched it in two installments and the Samsung smart TV app remember where I left off.
B000VBIGD6|3.0|I only received one and only odered one. I hope I do not get another one. How did two get ordered
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Ugh cute cute cut e cute cute cute cute cute cute cute  Cute game :) !!!!!! Try it.it might take a w hile to finish it though. Fun.
B00459EZLW|5.0|Great show that took too long to reveal itself for most fans to stick with it.  It is totally worth a watch.
B003K16P3M|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the book. It had much in it that I couldn't anticipate and that pleased me. A different viewpoint, but not ridiculously so. Very enjoyable!
B00FAIPDAE|3.0|Game play is generic build your own whatever gAme.  But it serves it is purpose of being a time killer
B00ADQPB50|5.0|REALLY FREAKING SCARY AND SOOO DERANGED!! I could not stop watching it was terrifying!! I loved ever thrilling second. If your into scary nail biting shows this is the show for you.
0316017930|5.0|1/3 of the way through the book, and it's awesome. Can't wait to keep reading! So insightful; I've found myself implementing some of the concepts in my life already.
B00FJTYRYM|1.0|I was so hoping for a genuine, thoughtful, film about maturing love-kind of rare in movies, I know.  Here, however, was a narcissistic couple, seemingly written with an intent to present unique, philosophical ideas and real conflicts within a long term relationship. What was created instead was, to me, cliche' ridden, dull, and simply a one- dimensional image of hostile, uninteresting, self-absorption.  One can't imagine how this couple can endure one another or themselves.  I personally had a very hard time watching this film and was so relieved when it was over.  I will seek out and appreciate gritty, true, unflinchingly honest dynamics within relationships in movies, but this felt completely contrived and grating.  If you enjoyed the film, bless you, you are a more tolerant person than I.
B00BEZTMFY|2.0|The background sound--music, etc.--was so relatively loud that I doubt I could hear more than a quarter of the dialogue. No adjustments of the sound system could compensate.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Like most Grisham novels, one you start it you are hooked. I hated to put it down, I couldn't wait to pick it up again.  A very good read!!!!
141694737X|4.0|When my kids were little, they loved Dear Zoo.  It has fun flaps to lift and discover animals under them.  I was happy to find it for my grandson.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|So addicting... but worth it! Gotta have this game on every device, there is always time for alittle bird action.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Arrow is a fun show with action and a good story.  I'm always looking forward to seeing what happens next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If I could get my son to work as hard in school as he does on this, I swear he would have graduated college already vs. struggling in the 7th grade. I'm glad that he can really get wrapped up in it thou, lets his imagination explode. Just need to put a few limitations on the amount of time he can play a day... lol.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Addictive.  I get mad when I run out of moves and have to put it down.  But, in reality, that is a good thing.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Good movie but so slow that it should have only been half time printed on DVD holder.  Had I been watching it in theater I would have fallen asleep.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I wish that it had more lives or that they timer to recharge was shorter but it is addictive all the same
B007K3JFUQ|2.0|It was like watching movie in fast forward, erratic, somewhat clever if one is hyperactive, out of control.  I was a nervous wreck and gained no insight whatsoever in first few minutes, perhaps seconds.
B003E6LC6I|4.0|The story line continues to bring the characters alive.  They become more involved with each others lives and you have to wonder if this is a good idea or not.  I'll let you decide:)
0316055433|4.0|Donna Tartt’s great strength is her characters: the smokey, indefatigable Boris and the brooding, melancholic Theo.  Boris in particular is a delightful creation -- enviable for his energy, optimism, and non-conformity -- but like Theo, seeking refuge from a dark past.  However, taken as a whole, Goldfinch is more of an enjoyable read than a meaningful work; it does not make the sort of lasting impression that Tartt achieved with A Secret History.<br /><br />Goldfinch is a little a little long, but the pace is fast and the suspense builds nicely.  In addition to complex and engaging characters, Tartt creates delightfully atypical but credible settings (a feral adolescence in the desert outside Vegas, an opiated apprenticeship to a furniture restorer) that excite the imagination.  Her weakness is prose, which though eminently readable, does not delight or add to the story.  The conclusion of Goldfinch is also a disappointment; not satisfied with the story’s ability to speak for itself, Tartt pontificates at length on its core themes - an unnecessary and obvious exposition that I mostly skimmed.
B00F031WB8|5.0|Good story of Jimi's upbringing & early life. I learned about what influenced him musically plus there are amazing clips of him playing and doing what made him so captivating to watch.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle's story is gripping. You get the feeling that you're right there along with him & his spotter as they flush out insurgents house by house. Plus the story of his long distance shot is amazing.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I follow the advice and be patient.  Looking for pieces of items is really tough.  Earning more dynamite would be nice.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|It's the basic game, would have 5 stars if I could skip the scoring animations, but I'm a fan of the game and it's a good play when winding down after work.<br /><br />Would also be higher stars if there were more of the expansions. But I can't complain about a good game.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|We did not like this as much as the other Muppet movies, but still enjoyed seeing our favorite Muppet characters in a new story.  Mom loves the Muppet/Man song.  Somehow it is not as funny as the others and we miss the original muppeteers (but what can you do about that?!).  Also the plot seems kind of...tired.  We have certainly watched it several times already, and most likely will watch it stil more.  Can't compare to Muppet Treasure Island, though, and of course the original Muppet Movie is the best of all.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Grisham has a way of bringing the characters alive on the pages and telling a story that keeps you wondering how it will all end.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Easy to use. Works well. What more do you need to know.This is a really good solitaire. Great job. I love all the different customizations and modes.
0307730697|5.0|My brother told me about this story about a year ago.  Once I finally picked it up, I couldn't put it down.  It's a heartbreaking story, but I was inspired by Adam Brown's faith in God.  He laid down his life for his friends, family, and country.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I tried to like this book I really, really did. Too many times the main characters broke up got back together only to break up again for stupid reasons. It had its moments when you laughed and thought the novel would redeem its self then Abby or Travis would say or do something that was soooooo far off the deep end that the story disappoints you.<br /><br />If you are looking for a youth book with a little adult scenes from time to time then go ahead and read this one. But if you are looking for a book that shows believable character development till the end you might want to skip this one, Abby and Travis just couldn't pull it off too many ( you got to be kidding moments).
B005LAIIMG|5.0|Good Movie, love Brad Pitt. I have to admit I love fast Zombies, ever since the movie 28 days later, I like Zombies that can scare me and that are really fast.
B00EJ9RIXA|3.0|I have this app on my phone, so I thought it would turn out similar, but unfortunately, it doesn't even look the same.<br /><br />You cannot open, edit, create new files like you do online. You have to have a separate program, to open and edit your files.<br /><br />So, it works, for what it's worth, but it's definitely not worth $2.99.
B000002UCN|5.0|It was the only way to purchase the song &#34;You&#34; anywhere. It was not available through iTunes or any other site. A nice mix of his Beatles sung songs and after. For the price, you can't beat it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This last book of the hunger games trilogy is so much darker than the ones before it. The story really takes some unexpected turns but the end is one that satisfies ur desire for the only happy ending that is plausible.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I didn't start reading The Hunger Games until after the movies came out. Once I started I couldn't put it down. It's honestly on of the best stories I've read in a long time. I told myself that I was going to stop with Catching Fire but in all honesty I wanted to know what happens. I was moved to tears each time.
1493643533|5.0|It's a fun story that is pleasant to read in this large format.  I don't buy tiny print books anymore.  This print is just what I need.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|yow. ppl unu fi buy a tablet and download subway suffers ppl just do it for me ppl it mad
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|It is not easy to navigate. Once I figured out the code navigation was much easier. The app requires to many steps to accomplish very little.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|I was surprised by this movie...it exceeded my expectations, which I admit was low. Also, its content was a good deal different from what I expected. I'm not a movie critic, but I recommend it highly.
B00003CXIP|5.0|Love this movie and have for the last 25 years.  This has all of the backstory about the film and great performances all around.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|Great quality, all the episodes play well except a few skips but nothing too serious :) Love this show and it shipped right on time!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I haven't seen the movie's but they caught my attention and made me decide to read this book.  I really enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading the others.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I liked most everything about this book. The thing I don't like is that's its a bit to vivid to my preference but still a great book. I gave it this rating because the book is a wonderful book and Suzanne Collins deserves a good rating on this book. Thank you.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Easy read. Kept you guessing what going on and wanting to Read more. Ready to see what's in store in book two.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|Game of Thrones is great series and has something for everyone, swords, sorcery, intense relationship drama, intricate plot interweaving, surprises and intrigue galore. Definitely worth watching but not for young kids.<br /><br />This product was a gift and was delivered quickly and in perfect condition.  I would highly recommend this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|My primary use for this is to cast Chrome tabs of streaming video from my laptop to HD tv. I have found my 2 Chromecasts do this to my satisfaction and for a price that can't be beat.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love this game! I've played Cubis on Big Fish Games, so this is comparable. It's basically a matching game, but all within a cube.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This will definitely be a book I read again and again. Absolutely wonderful with the way you can picture everything throughout the book.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|Bought these for my mom. I wasn't sure she'd like them, but she watched them with my kiddo and wanted the set.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|When I first started playing, I wasn't sure what the hype was about! I figured it was like any other game but it's not! Now I can put it down! I dream of clearing the board's almost every night now! Love it!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have rated all of the bingo games I've played on my Kindle and the only one I would not advise getting, especially if your like me and buy items for your games like chips and powerplays, is bingo bash; that game has yet to give me things I paid for days ago. They had no problem taking my money but as yet haven't given me what I paid for.<br /><br />So, if your looking for a good bingo game stay clear of bingo bash and give this one a try.
B00124DQZO|5.0|The best live album by Chicago!  Also a must get is Chicago & Earth, Wind & Fire at the Greek Theater DVD!
B00881VLCE|5.0|No Internet connection required to play so great for passing time while in the doctor's office or while I'm traveling.
B00B2DSK06|1.0|Have not received my DVD so I can give a recommendation about what I purchased so for now I'm not very happy
B00AOCZOLO|5.0|Great comedic wit. The sharp humor softens the edges to dealing with very real adult situations in a way that would otherwise be uncomfortable.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|We watch this every year!  The grandchildren love it although we have to distract them from a few words and gestures!
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|A good read, ending was easy to see - hoped for a more &#34;real&#34; end than what was given.<br />I did like the story, just looking for something other than &#34;that was a crazy plan - but it worked' ending.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Very fun game. You don't have to pay money to have fun, but you might throw a couple of bucks in just so you can play. You need gas to race, and a full tank of gas will last you about 30 minutes of game play. After that you have to wait for a refill or pay a few cents to fill it. You can also play this game OFFLINE, which is great for plane rides and traveling.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|Very Addictive but lots of fun!!!  I recommend this game for most ages, especially those who like a challenge and want to see instance results.
B00C5R8364|5.0|Great read and I suspect based in reality about terrorist target selection and how we stumble in our criminal justice system.
B00CDTSFF8|3.0|The series is a bit slow at first but then becomes more interesting towards the end..I'll be looking fwd to season two when available
B00BATG18K|5.0|The pages are filled with colorful characters who will challenge the reader's moral belief system. Amy Tan transports us to the turn of the twentieth century and the back rooms of the houses of flowers in Shanghai where we bear witness to the struggles and triumphs of the women within. As usual, the characters are complex, flawed, and impossible to dislike. One of those books you don't want to put down even as you are wishing for the story to keep going.
B000OV85AW|5.0|I rated the CD in this fashion because it WAS as I expected--a GREAT movie, and a GREAT copy!!  Well-done!!
6305922756|2.0|Terrible movie.  It's the worst. Do not buy. Do not rent. One good quote, &#34;we had all of our equipment modified to go to 11&#34;.
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Hilarious and original. Both the grownups and kids enjoy this. Its  cute and its funny. We enjoyed it and will watch  more.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I really like this game. I enjoy getting to create new items, explore new areas, and find new heroes. I don't like that the lady at the store will only buy certain items, in certain quantities. I think you should be able to sell her any of the items, regardless of how many you have. Aside from that, I really enjoy playing this game.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it was awesome amazing my favorite app the best app I ever had intill... an hour later after I tried to go on it and it wouldn't let me and I still can't go on it.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Keeps me busy for hours, love the length of this game!  Always something new and exciting, did I mention fun!!
B00FA1DGIW|5.0|My daughter loves The Wanted.  She thinks this CD is amazing!  So easy to sing along withand play over and over again.
B0035G0U2O|4.0|While alone they aren't spectacular, here's my reasoning behind the 4 stars: story & graphics [+1 star], supporting actors [+1 star];  most of the supporting actors were definitely on top of it.  The performances of Cusack and Peet playing his ex-wife, on the other hand, were /way/ below the level of the others, poor [-2 stars].  In Cusack's defense, I don't feel the leads were written very well but Chiwetel took it and ran with it [+1 star], so he can't blame the writing.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Typical Grisham.  Well laid out  good characters, but a little predictable. Still couldn't put it down. Enjoyed it a lot.
B002RI9ORI|3.0|A good and much needed look at the flaws in modern medicine, both alternative and conventional. But it suffers from an intense bias against fields that the author either does not fully understand, or has chosen to only partially represent. For someone so against cherry-picking, he cherry picks the worst of the nutrition and alternative medicine fields without providing any positive insights for balance and perspective.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I've enjoyed this book and I love how the author hasn't been influenced to relate only Jobs' good side.<br /><br />I'm not an Apple fan and I don't own any Apple products, but I've been fascinated by Jobs' life and he's a good example for everyone, even though he hasn't been the kindest person on Earth. Much better than all motivational books.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is th  best. I recommend  this game  for everyone  . I'm fourteen an  I love  this game  . This game  is like temple run, but better because  it's MINIONS.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|If you want my advice, just take the cost of this device, and throw the $35. out the window the next time a Windstorm is coming! I mean that, the only practical use for this Device, is for someone wanting to shoot a signal by way of cell phn.  I made the mistake of listening to news people hype this device, and I can assure anyone this is only for a very select few individuals. I actually bought this thinking I could send the signal to another tv in the home?  This is the most overhyped device I've ever came in contact with. Not overhyped by the People at Amazon, but others in the Media.  I have a Brother-in-law, an Electrical Engineer, that played with this for a few hours, and as I said to him in the beginning, it won't do anything at my house, but if you can use it, it's yours! His reply no thanks, this device is only good for a specific, number of limited users. Or to be more blunt, he could find no practical use for it! Save your money, unless you have a Vast Knowledge of Electronics, definitely not a practical device! I'm still looking for someone who can use it? When I do, I will gladly give it to them, just wish I could send it back!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best game ever. It is like temple run but better. Have you seen all the costumes! It can be described as the best game in the entire galaxy. Recommended for kids
1476727651|5.0|Danny was never really well represented on screen. People mostly remember the Shining as a great Jack movie with Olive Oyl as his poor wife (she mostly screamed). Constant Readers remember the Shining as the novel that scared the crap out of them. Using the bathroom would never be the same. Danny was amazing in the book and Hollorann a hero. Wendy was competent, and did her best. Dr Sleep gives us a look into a probable future for these people with a big dose of King thrown in. Expect some twists and turns that you may see coming but can't stop reading anyway. The villans are an interesting group and their story is compelling.<br />Uncle Stevie has a way of pulling you in, keeping you entertained and opening your mind to a different thought process. The Hospice scenes are poingant and real (I have a bit of experience there), and make Danny someone you care about even more.<br />Thanks Uncle Stevie for letting us know what happened to him and Hollorann, I kinda wondered how they were.
1609419693|5.0|If you like Tina Fey, you'll love her book.  Apparently, she can do anything.  I enjoy hearing an author read their own stories, and I enjoyed her stories.  She makes me laugh out loud.  Bossypants did not disappoint.
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|This is an awesome game! Can't put it down. Graphics are top notch! Didn't want to stop playing to write review.
1600242405|1.0|If you want to know every detail about Keith Richards' life, beginning at conception, then this is the book for you.  There must be thousands of cool stories to tell, and I thought they would all be included in this unnecessarily lengthy book.  Unfortunately, even the good parts were made out to be boring.  I pushed hard to get through half of this book.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|For my purposes, this is an amazing app and it represents the last piece of puzzle called &#34;how to make my tablet a tool and not a time consuming gadget?&#34;.<br />Call me old-fashioned but, being born in 1970's, I am a digital immigrant and my mind is set to work in a linear way, following and noting my thoughts from one page of my notebook to another - and that is what this app allows in a digital way.<br />Just to be fair, I add two more things I miss and that would make this app perfect (for me): to be able to share an entry with Google Keep (I tend to work also on a computer and GK represents for me the simplest way of accessing my working notes) and to be able to change the order of entries in a notebook. I am confident that with a time, this will also be added.<br />Well done, Droidveda!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This app allows for the creation of good documents on the go.  However, it does not allow for creating documents in MLA format.  After printing the documents that I type the margins and font size are wrong.  There is also no way to create a header.  I will continue to use this app but it would be great to see some improvements.
140006922X|5.0|Contrary to the hype this is not some revisionist attack on the figure of Jesus. Quite the contrary, the book covers ground well trodden before.<br /><br />All accounts of the historical figure of Jesus would be considered controversial and potentially offensive by people brought up with the story of Jesus as presented by the Christian churches. I am a Christian but no one can rationally portray the new testament as a history book, if you try you will soon find yourself tied in knots of self evident contradictions. Fortunately, most Christians admit to themselves that belief requires faith in a fairly vague concept and not an historically accurate description of one man's life. The minority of Christians who do accept the bible at face value are fortunately protected in their faith by avoiding reading anything that challenges their fundamentalism.<br /><br />Reza Aslan's book has suffered the glare of publicity that the many, many other books of this genre written by Christians and agnostics have avoided. Some fundamentalists will no doubt have been encouraged to read some or all of it (or perhaps just a description from someone else). No doubt they have been offended and will continue to be deeply offended. Heaven help them if they ever read any of the other books covering this topic - because frankly most of this body of work is far more scathing in its treatment of Jesus the man and all of it is disparaging about the gospels as historical documents.<br /><br />So if the book offers nothing new what it does offer is an extremely good read, exceptionally well written and very accessible. I didn't learn anything new and disagreed with some of the statements (I do not believe that &#34;render unto Caesar what is Caesar's and unto God what is God's&#34; was ever meant to be a call to arms), but I enjoyed the presentation and finished the book with a much more sympathetic feeling towards this man from Nazareth.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|Just as expected.  Great product!  It delivers!!  Top quality Blue Ray dics, great sound, great interface, amazing presentation.  Thanks.  Go ahead and buy it!
0307474275|1.0|I read the first few of pages of this book shortly after it came out in paperback because I wondered what all the fuss was about. Right from the beginning it is fairly clear that it is junk and that would have been that. I then mentioned to a friend (she is still a friend) that it seems like the worst form of mindless pulp. &#34;No, no&#34; she insisted &#34;read on, it has subtle twists&#34;. So I bought the book to take away on holiday. I forced my way through a few chapters. God almighty, there is not a cliche that Dan Brown misses... I gave up in a huff.<br /><br />When I got home I confronted my &#34;friend&#34;. I told her that the plot was so obvious it hurt....<br /><br />..... please stop reading now if you are under 12 and don't want to read a spoiler....<br /><br />I told her the stereotype Englishman was obviously the villain, obviously Dan Brown was going to make some sort of weak pun about Sacred Blood and Holy Grail (Sangue Real if you missed it) and the book would be turned into a really bad B movie, probably with Harrison Ford - so I might as well just wait for that. &#34;No, no&#34; she said &#34;you might think it is obvious, but like I said it is really very subtle&#34;.<br /><br />Now, I really liked the films &#34;a beautiful mind&#34; and &#34;the sixth sense&#34;. Both of which lead you to believe you are watching a fairly mediocre film until the very end when you realize you have been fooled and in fact there was a hidden plot, which once recognized makes you conclude the bits of the films you didn't like were actually brilliant red herrings. So &#34;my friend&#34; convinced me to read on. Which I did, forcing back the bile that ascended every time a secret sign, like Micky Mouse or Newton's apple were explained in an ersatz intellectual way. It was agony.<br /><br />Guess what, in the end this trashy book delivered exactly what it had promised right from the start. The only thing I had missed was that Harrison Ford obviously has too much taste to get involved with this sort of story. Actually, I watched a bit of the film with Tom Hanks, trust me it is much better than the book.<br /><br />My take home message is that if you want a good book about the Catholic Church, read Morris West - read the the bible - read anything.... but to save your sanity do not read this.ste to get involved with this sort of story.

0439023521|5.0|I guess it has all been said before, but I finally got around to reading this trilogy in preparation for the catching fire movie, and I love it!  I think reading the book doesn't take away from the movies but add to them.
0385366477|5.0|Have not finished yet I am on the last cd but can't wait to hear it. I listened to it on the both way to work and could not wait to get back in the cat to hear more. The story gets you hooked on all the characters and you can't wait to k ow what happens next. Jake is very likeable and the Lushin is crazy but you still like him. You feel sorry for Letty with all she has to go through. The reader is great.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|It takes a while to get into it, but once you do, you will love it!  It also teaches you about what another culture has gone through.  People should not forget this.
B00AKKTDJY|1.0|I downloaded this game about 2 weeks ago for my Kindle and it has yet to actually let my niece play.  It crashes every time we open it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's a page turner.  One should start from the first books he wrote on Mitch Rapp and you won't be able to put it down.  One also learns about Washington.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Both of the new Star Trek movies are fantastic. THe cast is superb and well chosen....all of them. Thank you.
0316069515|4.0|i've read all of the mickey halloran books including this latest.  i've enjoyed them all with the LINCOLN LAWYER being my favorite and with a subsequent movie every bit as good.  however, i've also read all of the harry bosch books, his half brother who is a homicide detective.  i like the bosch books better because he is a better character. the pace is also much better straight across the board on the bosch books.  they rip right along. connelly has even written with a reporter for the LA TIMES (like himself) as the protagonist and i would have really enjoyed reading more of those.<br /><br />as to this specific novel, mickey is in the doghouse on several levels.  he lost being prosecutor and is back to defense work.  his first ex wife, a prosecutor, and teenage daughter shun him for being a defense lawyer and i really have a problem with the reality of this.  no matter how ardent a prosecutor you are, you must realize on some level that without a defense attorney, the defendant will be acquitted.  that is the system.  so i don't find his former family all that believable although his half brother, harry bosch, i believe his family scenario totally.<br /><br />mickey has a surprise twist in this book. for the first time he has an innocent client.  this is the pimp of his long time and now dead client, Glory, a high end escort-call girl. although his client is innocent, just about every other character in the book other than his staff is guilty of high crimes.  he has to sort through all of these people to find out who really did the crime.<br /><br />i didn't race right through this book as i typically do with a connelly novel but it was a good reading experience over a couple of days.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B00F8OUBXE|4.0|Oh Hell Yes! Been waiting for an album like this for a long time from the Church! There are quite a few folks on here saying that it's the best since The Dark. Well, I couldn't agree more! All hail one of the best metal bands from the 80's!
B00FATEJYE|3.0|This game is awesome. I wish it had all of the characters from the console game and that it was easier to get more coins. Also I think normal nightwing should be stronger.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual, enjoyed Rapp's adventures in The Last Man. So sad that this was Vince's last novel! Going to miss reading my favorite author!
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|They've done a great job convincing us as the audience that the world of the Scandinavians was real, gritty, and beautiful. The acting is very well done, characters convince us of the many different points of view.
0385344333|5.0|The Jack Reacher is great in the series of books. Don't bother seeing the movie it totally sucked. Tom Cruise was not Reacher
B001EN71CW|5.0|One of the best creations of television Sci-Fi ever made. Period. Speaks of broader implications of our current society today, and perhaps gives hope because of it.
B0091XICM0|5.0|classic movie they don't get any better then this I know it looks dated by todays standards at one time this was top of the line action.
B00FPH51LQ|4.0|Fun , action and a little romance rolled into one.  I think people will either love it or hate,  I am guessing the women folk will give it higher ratings than the guyes, but  I loved it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I haven't  read in a while, but enjoyed the first book so much I had to get this. It did not disappoint.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very interesting and well written book about loss and faith.  Loved how the author intertwined the characters throughout the book.  Kept me guessing what was going to happen next and then aha....you were given the story to put all the pieces together.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Didn't watch this for a year as I had heard mixed reviews.  I shouldn't have listened.  This was a great production and the singing by  its stars was excellent.  The acting was amazing and the set was amazing. As a vocal music teacher, I will share this with my older students.
B008XG1X18|5.0|PINTERST IS MY LIFE! I love it.  Especially the humor catagory . But, all I love to do is pin pin pin pin pin.  I ABSOLUTELY LOVE 1D PREFERENCES, TYPE IT IN AND U WILL LOVE IT. #@Ilovepinterest&infin;&times;&infin;&trade;
B008VO3PA4|5.0|Yes, I am owned by a handsome orange CAT.  This book of CAT poems delighted my soul.  Definitely worth reading.  Love it.
B005T87QCI|5.0|This is the best fighting game I have played. It really is like the movie! Even some characters our in the movie.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Good characters and plots although the episodic plots get resolved very quickly (42 minutes) and the series plot involving the scandal is going on a little too long.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I loved Dexter and miss the series; but I had missed Season 6, so I had to order it before I saw Season 7 and the final Season 8. Now what do I watch on Sunday night?
B003PJ6UHA|5.0|How God works is made plausible in this book, though the author would deny that was his intent.  I've personally been thinking along these lines for 10 years and the authors have helped me as a non-physicist, though science guy,  put words and images to my own thoughts.
B000683VI4|5.0|Loved the movie. This is a movie that you can see time and time again, and still it is not enough. Very romantic love story..
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive.Awesome.Fun.A great way to spend extra time,even when you don't have any! I love this game!  Can't get enough of this game!
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|If you love Christmas, then you will love this movie. I have seen this movie multiple times over the years around the holidays and I never get tired of it. The HD version is the best, providing crystal-clear clarity...
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Wow, wow, and wow! What an awesome game. The  colors, the music, and the challenges are so well blended I can't stop. This is a must have!
B00AHGUCNM|5.0|Loved this movie, so I had to have since the holidays are here. And the HD makes such a difference in the quality of picture..
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|Very fun classic game! Plus the ads aren't annoying and jumping up in the middle of the game. Definitely should get it.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|Good movie, always watched the series, so I had to see the movie. Really miss the series, and I still watch the reruns...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|OMG! I cant wait to go to book three. This is the perfect love story. I sooo love it. Is better than anything u have ever read. Promise :-)
