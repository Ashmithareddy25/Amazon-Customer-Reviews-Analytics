B0058YPILY|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase and it arrived in a timely manner. I am sure that the next time I order I will look for your site. Price was in range of what I wanted to spend. Thank you very much
B005LAIGNC|3.0|The combat action in the air is well done is this movie, which tells the story of black fighter pilots during World War II. The movie itself is okay, but predictable. Personally, I found the DVD extras to be better than the movie. There is a documentary about the pilots in which they interview the actual pilots who are still alive, and the documentary is outstanding. If you like World War II history you'll love it. There's a fascinating story about first lady Eleanor Roosevelt visiting the aviation school down south, amazing. There's also an interesting interview with producer Lucas. The pilots were there on set helping the director and actors get things right.

0439023521|5.0|Think I read this book now ... hmmm 4 times?  It keeps getting better everytime.  I love this one most out of the trilogy, though I'll safely say all three are worth the read.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This one is right up there with Lone Survivor and American Sniper. This book met all of my expectations and it is nice to get the truth on how they took down the coward hiding in his rat hole. If you are into the Seal books you will like this. Thank you Navy Seals for being such bad asses and protecting this country.
B002GHIPYI|5.0|I love these headphones! I'm surprised with me wearing glasses they stay comfortable while I wear them, barely being on the snug side with my large head. Besides that, yes, they have great audio quality. I was afraid when they said Semi-Open that it wouldn't be a comfortable or effective fit over my ears, but like I said earlier, they fit well over my ears and where my glasses line.<br />One of the first things I checked was the strength of the cable, as I bought this along with a Zalman Clip-on microphone. It's quite thick, and I noticed it comes with the adapter piece already on it, so you could plug it into an amp or other device. (The clip-on still fits, despite it being a thick and durable cable)<br /><br />So far, 5 star product! I love this thing, having a comfortable set of headphones makes all the difference.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have been a supernatural junkie since season one and I have to say the best gets better. I love watching the show and on more then one occasion watched all seasons back to back. I feel that season six was a let down in some ways because it felt like they were just going through the motions to set up for season 7. But then 7 blew my mind in all ways possible. I couldn't get enough. My only problem was (SPOILER ALERT) Dean going to pergatory we've all seen it before in the form of hell. It was kinda predictable. Still a great show either way. Buy it

B000FC1MM8|4.0|Enjoyed the atmospheric setting and characters.  Not into chick-reads, an occasional rom-com is fine, so this was a dandy alternative
B004VMVTNU|5.0|The combination of physical movement (shaking the phone) and mental stimulation (simple math problems) makes this alarm app impossible to ignore. I love that I can customize just about every aspect of the app from how many times to allow myself to snooze, to how difficult the math gets. Even though I got it for free, I WOULD pay for this if I ever had to.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|It held my attention at first but the middle of the book is becoming tedious.  I loved her previous book and was excited to read his one, now I just want to skip to the end.
B0016492BW|3.0|Love the movie.  One of my favorites.  Love the transfer to blu-ray.  Crystal clear for the most part (a few scenes were apparently more problematic to transfer and are still pretty blurry, and it can be jarring when you come across those scenes because they really do stand out).  The extras are limited but interesting, and informative, with the possible exception of Terry Gilliam's commentary on the lost animation sequences.  (He really didn't sound very happy to be doing them.)<br /><br />However, the \\"Ultraviolet Digital Copy\\" feature on this disc (which is adminstered by Sony) is entirely worthless.  You may think you are getting an actual copy of the movie to watch on your ipod, iPad, or other device at your leisure, right?  WRONG.  The downloadable copy is for your desktop or other primary computer ONLY.  And in order to get that, you must create an account with Sony, give them your personal information, and install their proprietary software (Silverlight) to download and view the copy.  After giving them my name, email and other information (and agreeing to allow them to send me marketing materials at that email address, which YOU MUST DO to proceed with the account creation - there is no way to opt out and still continue), jumping through all the installation hoops and installing Silverlight, it took my computer an additional 6 and one half hours over high-speed DSL to download this +/- 90 munite epic.  Amazing speed and efficiency, no?  Incidentally, the download also overheated and burned out my old DSL modem.<br /><br />After all that, I tried to transfer the downloaded movie to iTunes.  Guess what?  You can't.  If you want to download it to a mobile device, you have to install additional software, go through the Ultraviolet site again, and essentially repeat the download process on that device.  God only knows how long it will take to download it agfain using an A5 chip...  Then, you can view the movie at your leisure on your mobile device, right?  Not according to the folks who have tried it!  If you are foolish enough to remove your mobile device from your house, you're out of luck!  You see, if you get outside the range of your WiFi connection, the movie will not be viewable.  Apparently the digital copy needs to contact Sony every time you try to view it.  Just a little quirk that Sony forgot to mention to you!  Want to take a copy of the movie on vacation?  Too bad!  Long car or plane ride?  Too bad!  Maybe someone should call Sony and inform them of the meaning of the word \\"mobile\\" so they stop advertising their \\"digital copy\\" for your \\"mobile device\\".<br /><br />So, buy this blu-ray version movie if you only want the movie itself and do not want the \\"digital copy\\" (sorry I keep putting it in quotes, but I feel like, if there is no actual copy of the film that you can move around between devices, in what sense do you have an actual \\"copy\\" of anything?) go ahead and buy it.  Frankly, I can't recommend the movie enough.  Just don't expect to be able to use the \\"digital copy\\" that comes with it.<br /><br />PS:  There are a number of movies (like James Cameron's new release of \\"Titanic\\" on blu-ray) that come with actual, bona fide digital copies. You plug a download code into iTunes, and it downloads automatically.  And you can watch that on any device you transfer a copy to.  Just look for the little \\"iTunes\\" logo on the cover.  And stay away from anything marked with \\"Ultraviolet\\".  Ultraviolet is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, not worth the time.  In short, UV copies are worthless.
0812992784|4.0|In 1989 I was in the last year of high school in Tehran. After a break and before the \\"religion study\\" (of course), a student wrote in English  \\"Satanic Verses\\" on the blackboard, since that was the news the night before, and since the phrase sounded cool.  I still remember the handwriting. For weeks to come, he wet his pants why he did that. For entering university in Iran, you needed to be cleared by the school that you have pure thoughts and strong islamic belief (definitely not satanic).<br /><br />Fast forward to 1998, I was a student in Europe enjoying a scholarship to study Science. I started reading the Satanic Verses, just to find out why the grand Ayatollah and the Iranian regime is so keen to kill its author. It took me one non-interrupted year for the first reading (thanks to my full scholarship to do Science). For a science conference I needed to get a visa to Britain (having Iranian passport, you are only qualified to enter Heaven, but pretty much no place in Earth). I am sitting in the British consulate reading my book. I turned back and saw two Pakistanis with long beard (an old and a young guy) sitting behind me. The type who wanted to kill the author. I freaked out having the book Satanic Verses in my hand. I changed my seat so that they can't see what I am reading. Then I realised the British behind the counter now can see an Iranian guy reading the book, wanting to enter the United Kingdom (and probably is familiarising himself with his target).<br /><br />That was my thought: if a student in Iran wetting his pants for just writing the name of the book and an average guy wetting his pants (both ways) by just having the book in his hand, what would the writer himself must go through?<br /><br />The book Joseph Anton answers that. It is a brutally honest account of 10 years of hiding. Rushdie writes of the confusion the event created \\"he realised,..., that he no longer understood his life\\". He writes about his shame, \\"While all this and much more was happening (referring to publishers and bookshops bravely continuing the publication) the author of the Satanic Verses was crouching in shame behind a kitchen worktop to avoid being seen by a sheep farmer\\". And here is why \\"...the working of Muslin 'honour culture' at the poles of whose moral axis were honour and shame, very different from Christian narrative of guilt and redemption. He came from that culture even though he was not religious,  had been raised to care deeply about questions of pride. To skulk and hide was to lead to dishonourable life. He felt, very often in those years, profoundly ashamed. Both shamed and ashamed\\".<br /><br />The book is an account of tremendous pressure and assault from all fronts. From his wife, from the British police, tabloids and not to mention the faithfuls and Iranian.  \\"His biggest problem, he thought in his most bitter moments, was that he wasn't dead...He was supposed to be dead, but he obviously hadn't understood that. That was the headline everyone has set up, just waiting to run\\"... \\"two shots to the head and one to the chest\\"...<br /><br />But the book, 630 pages, is also an account of how he put on a fight. Along the way, how literature and his passion for literature kept him sane, \\"The greatest danger of the growing menace was that good men would commit intellectual suicide and call it peace. Good men would give in to fear and call it respect.\\"<br /><br />Throughout the work, Rushdie's humour is present, something he always complained people missed in his work:<br />A woman asking, \\"Mr. Rushdie, I have read your novel, Midnight's Children. It's a very long novel, but never mind, I read it through. And my question for you is this: Fundamentally, what's your point?\\".  In a letter to his mother \\"...an imam wants to ban the 'blasphemous' Barbie doll. Would you ever have thought that poor Barbie and I would be guilty of the same offence?\\"<br /><br />The book is long and very detailed. This could become a bit frustratingas one feels giving too much details (nights with friends, going for take away food, etc) could hide the bigger picture. This was accurately noted in a review by Kenan Malik:<br /><br />\\"it is in exploring the wider issues of the Rushdie affair that Joseph Anton is, perhaps surprisingly, at its weakest. The memoir is extraordinarily rich in detail. It provides a blow-by-blow account of the meetings, the arguments, the feuds, the emotions.  And yet that detail is rarely used to illuminate the big picture, to explore the bigger social, cultural, political and intellectual changes that the Rushdie affair has wrought, or at least symbolised. It was through the Rushdie affair that many of the issues that now dominate political debate - multiculturalism, free speech, radical Islam, terrorism - first came to the surface.  It was also through the Rushdie affair that our thinking about these issues began to change. Few people are better placed than Rushdie himself to talk about these changes and to link the details to the historical shifts. Yet, that broader frame is largely missing in Joseph Anton. And without a frame the richness of detail can appear as a case of `one damn event after another'.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed reading through the book. One thing is clear: This book is not in the same league as his masterpieces Midnight's Children and the Satanic Verses. There one has a brilliant author who worked on each of the books for 5 years. There, one can feel each paragraph has been worked on, thought about, and researched.<br /><br />Despite that \\"he told his friends...his life has turn to a bad novel\\", Rushdie manages to write a good book out of that!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Seen it twice in theatres. And just got it today! This movie has everything and then some. For all the dvd users. You would be better off buying either the bluray/dvd verison or the 4 disc set. What is 3$ more? As of right now the 4disc set is the same as the 2disc set! 19.99! Eventually you will have to upgrade to bluray,but even if you don't just sell the disc individually and make some extra money.

B0090EHVMC|5.0|It was the selection for our family movie night and we all loved it from the animation, to the songs, to the message.
B004OR199G|4.0|Definitely a book that follows my lifestyle.  Recommend for those in the same boat, and for those that are ready to make a change.
B001UV4XWY|4.0|I think if I didn't think too deep about altruism, morality, rationality, right choices or bad choices but just see this as a pure entertainment movie then it'd be totally awesome!!  The creepiness and weirdness (unbelievably weird!) just puzzled me and made me scream: \\"oh-God-what-the-hell-is-going-on?\\" but at the same time I liked it so bad, this movie is so extreme that you either love it or hate it.  Most impresses me was the first time I saw the half-face man, had me shivered to my bones.<br /><br />So if you can put seriousness aside, this is a quite \\"special\\" horror story (not everyone agrees) with a twisted sense for some 2-hour reality-get-away break, consider it relatively fresh from our usual cheesy comedies, then why not??
B004EF2XC0|5.0|Sooo GOOD!!!! This is the stuff of romance!!! I just love the pace of this miniseries! Sure the ending is a little rushed. I wish there was more. More talk/explanation and of course I did feel sorry for Henry, but AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!! So good. I love Thorton. Sure he was a total ass in the beginning. And he's quite the \\"Master\\" snob, BUT he was good. He had reasons, a bit violent, but yeah... I wished there was more Margaret and Thorton scenes though. But the little glances are so cute. Love it!!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|Jennifer Egan is a talented writer. I became interested in her after reading 2 of her short stories in the New Yorker, which turned out to be chapters 3 and 4. The stories tie together through various characters to build a larger story. The characters are interesting if not likeable and always flawed. I wanted to know more about some characters but maybe that will come in future stories. <br />I would highly recommend this book to others.

Overall it is a great series. I have told people to read it and they loved it to.

0061730327|5.0|There are a bunch of great reviews of this book already, but coming late to the party, I'll summarize the awesomeness of this book for me:<br /><br />1) In a world where too many hopeful stories seem 90% manufactured, this came across as incredibly real.<br /><br />2) The perseverance, ingenuity, and raw brain sweat involved are an inspiration. It definitely makes me think twice about limiting what I can and can't achieve by the obvious resources around me, and makes me want to keep digging to make things happen.<br /><br />3) The community aspects of it all were also very touching for me, given the huge impact his work had not only on his own family but the community around them.

0140544518|5.0|It turns out that the story we thought we knew about the three little pigs was all wrong.  And finally Alexander Wolf is getting a chance to set the record straight.  He's not that bad a guy.  In fact, on the day in question, he just wanted to borrow some sugar for his grandmother's birthday cake.  Unfortunately, he had a really bad sneezing cold.  And what was he supposed to do when he found a dead pig in the rubble of that first house?<br /><br />This is a funny take on the story we all know with a great twist.  You've got to give the author credit because he creates a plausible story of why the actions of the original story happened without any of it being the wolf's fault.  That's what makes it so funny.  The illustrations by Lane Smith help tell the story.  And it will teach kids that there are truly two sides to every story and some times you have to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying.<br /><br />Well, that's if you are going to take the story seriously.  If you are just reading it for fun, you'll find some great laughs as you get an alternative take on this classic fable.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Wonderful application as everyone has said.  Highly addictive.  My one negative is that the application on the Kindle Fire does not seem to have the same functionality of purchasing Peach time lags or Strawberry power bursts as the same app on the iPad.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Highly prolific author Stephen King has long been known as a master of the horror genre, but lately he's been branching out a bit beyond his typical foundations. With 11/22/63, he takes a swing at science fiction (sort of) and alternate history, with a tale about time-travel, and the attempt to prevent John F. Kennedy's assassination in Dallas, Texas. So how does this story hold up against King's other works? Can his writing satisfy devoted science fiction fans, as well as the casual reader?    There's no doubting Stephen King's skill with the written word. He's written so many novels that it's nearly impossible to keep up with them all. He truly is a master author, and it shows in 11/22/63. Immediately gripping and intriguing, the story pulls the reader in and almost never lets go. King transports his readers back to 1958, to an America that was much more trusting-whether people were worthy of that trust or not. He brings the late 50′s and early 60′s back to life in a way that's both believable and realistic. King doesn't polish the people or settings to make them look like they were the greatest years of America; instead, he faithfully renders the characters, the scenes, and the dialogue to make it clear that Dallas in 1960 was just as grimy, cluttered, and broken as big cities are in modern times-only the cast was different. The differences in the sexes are portrayed as they were-skewed toward men, and the court of public opinion clearly on the side of propriety. Police were much more likely to take someone at their word, and King leaves no stone unturned when describing the setting. It's as if he personally lived across the street from Lee Harvey Oswald during those years, watching from a window, peeking into the life of a deeply disturbed man. The research that King must have done for this novel clearly shows, as the movements of Oswald, his wife, and his associates are described in incredible detail.    The characters in 11/22/63 are as equally well-developed as the settings. Jake Epping-the main character-is likable, empathetic, and most of all, genuine. Throughout the novel, he's forced to employ methods he'd rather not, but in his mission to save JFK's life, he must come to terms with the idea that the past doesn't want to be changed-despite his good intentions. He falls in love with a woman from the 60′s, Sadie Dunhill, who's had her own troubled past, and is believably broken by her experiences. By the end of the novel, readers will care as much about these characters as they do about their own family. Even Lee Harvey Oswald is portrayed so believably, it's difficult to imagine that King didn't know him personally. The novel is filled with characters that leap right off the page and into the reader's mind, feeling more like real people rendered into words, rather than the creation of the author. It's quite an accomplishment, and one that's rarely done better than Stephen King has done here.    The dialogue is equally believable. Terms from the 60′s, and terms from the 00′s mix and weave together, and Epping is called out on his strange choice of words from time to time. Even local dialects are described perfectly as Jake makes his way around the country, meeting people from all over. Most impressive is a telephone conversation with JFK, in which the President's Boston accent and cadence is captured perfectly; it's likely to give readers' a chill.    11/22/63 is at heart a time-travel story, and the entire series of events revolves around that time-travel-yet the novel doesn't really feel like a science fiction book. Part of this is the fact that King doesn't try to unravel the mysteries behind the `rabbit-hole' (except perhaps a tiny bit near the end), instead letting the readers' imagination run wild and speculate for themselves. The pure emotion behind Epping's desire to save JFK is what drives the story, and the surprises he finds when he gets where he's going-like Sadie Dunhill-are what make the journey worth taking. Jake finds himself with a lot of time to kill-years, essentially. Somehow, he not only successfully passes the time, but learns and grows from it. By the end, it's clear that the time-travel involved in 11/22/63 has its consequences, and that it's up to Jake to choose, but the choice becomes increasingly difficult for him to make-and for readers to agree or disagree with.    This novel by Stephen King is most certainly a departure for the author, and one that readers should invest their time in. Yes, it's a long novel-perhaps too long, by far-but it's a fantastic read. The second-half in particular is intense, and intensely enjoyable. Perhaps the only criticism is that the length of the book sometimes feels unnecessary. At over 800 pages, it's a staggering amount of material to wade through, even with as well as King has written it. There are sections that feel rather drawn-out, but perhaps that's the point; readers feel the time along with Jake Epping, and make that journey with him-in the form of pages, rather than the years Epping himself has to struggle through. Still, a casual read it is not-be prepared to devote significant time to reading 11/22/63. It's well worth the read, however, and will change your mind about a great many things. Even those who aren't fans of Stephen King should pick this one up-it's very likely to surprise them.    Originally published at [...]

B005FITIK0|4.0|Dynamic duo, Jason Reitman and Diablo Cody, return with a vengeance with their dramatic comedy, Young Adult. Mavis (Charlize Theron), a former &iexcl;°it&iexcl;± girl and successful YA author, is fresh off a divorce and looking to escape her stagnant city life. She heads back to her small-town home with hopes of winning back an old high school flame (Patrick Wilson). Here&iexcl;¯s the catch: he&iexcl;¯s now married and father to a newborn. So what&iexcl;¯s a successful girl to do? Throw in a home distillery, a disabled former classmate (Patton Oswalt), a manipulative plan and what do you get? A whole lot of soul-searching.<br /><br />It&iexcl;¯s safe to say, I did not expect Young Adult to be what it was. From the previews I was anticipating more of a comedic romp with mild substance. Young Adult, however, is not that type of film.There are touches of comedy, sure, but it&iexcl;¯s a darker humour that&iexcl;¯s inspired more by the dramatic narrative than anything else. Cody (of Juno fame) is masterful at crafting a touching story and I think her writing resonates with me because she creates such amazingly relatable characters. There is a realness to them and the desperate situations in which they find themselves. These aren&iexcl;¯t your average stock characters&iexcl;ªeach one is beautiful, funny, ugly and tragic in their own way. I liked them, I hated them and empathized with them all and that&iexcl;¯s what made this movie so damn memorable.<br /><br />Let&iexcl;¯s start with Mavis. Mavis was that perfect girl in high school, you know the type&iexcl;ªthe one that all the guys wanted to be with and all the girls wanted to be. Like, gag me with a spoon! Yeah.To the townies she&iexcl;¯s seen as this successful hot-shot living the royal life in the big city. But almost immediately we learn that appearances aren&iexcl;¯t always what they seem. Mavis has become a neurotic egoist struggling to cope with a crumbling life and dwindling fame. She lacks any sort of moral compass and she quickly crosses the line into shallow territory when she plots stealing her ex away. It quickly becomes clear that Mavis has some serious personal issues. First, can I just say&iexcl;ªCharlize Theron has totally outdone herself and created nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece playing the anti-heroine. Theron is brilliant at bringing both the depth and range needed to play such a messed up individual. Not many people could pull off this type of role so successfully. The subtle nuances of her performance had me completely riveted and still rooting for Mavis despite how unlikable she really is.<br /><br />Now enter, Matt, the only seemingly reasonable person that Mavis hooks up with while visiting her hometown. In high school he was bullied and abused by people in the popular crowd, and though still bitter, manages to have a firm hold on who he is and what he wants. He is the only one who&iexcl;¯s not blinded by Mavis&iexcl;¯ fame and doesn&iexcl;¯t hold back when trying to bring her back down to reality. In short, it&iexcl;¯s hard not to feel sorry for Matt. He&iexcl;¯s a pawn that people push around both physically and emotionally and he bears the scars to prove it. Mavis uses him for her own selfish reasons, yet you admire the sense of inner strength he&iexcl;¯s gained because of it. He&iexcl;¯s somewhat of a dorky character who carries his own personal demons but is altogether still loveable. Oswalt did a phenomenal job conveying the loneliness and wit needed for such a role. He&iexcl;¯s the most likable person in the entire movie and I spent the whole time wishing I could give him a big ol&iexcl;¯ bear hug.<br /><br />So I won&iexcl;¯t spoil the ending, but believe me, it left me wondering&iexcl;ªdo people ever really change? We&iexcl;¯re not necessarily given the happiest of conclusions but at least it&iexcl;¯s a brutally honest one. Reitman, once again, has done wonders at making supremely complicated people seem soutterly fascinating with appropriately timed comedy and engaging dialogue. He&iexcl;¯s given us a film that enables us to look deep within ourselves and question our own intentions as well as the intentions of the characters on screen.

B00782O7IY|4.0|A cynical viewer might consider \\"The Artist\\" to be a gimmick movie, and the only reason it won the Oscar for best picture was because it evoked the Golden Age to a bunch of the old fogies in the Academy.  This hypothetical cynic is missing the point entirely, and even if he wasn't, a gimmick movie can still be a worthwhile viewing experience.  As for the film itself, it is so cheerful, so open, so honest that only the most jaded cynic could fail to be won over by it.<br /><br />As I'm sure most readers of this review will know, the film is black-and-white, and (mostly!) silent.  Naturally there is music, which always accompanied silent films in the theatre.  There are a few, well-placed uses of sound (it turns out that Uggi the Dog has more spoken lines than both the human stars put together), but for 99% of the time the jazzy soundtrack is the only sound we hear while we are watching the images.  The plot is so simple that it can be fully summarized as such: star gets washed up; new star comes up; reconciliation at the end by the old star to the new situation, helped by the new star (the new situation meaning the advent of sound in motion pictures).  That is not a criticism - the quality of a picture is measured in how well the parts (acting, special effects, dialogue if any!) serve to tell the story.  I was, perhaps oddly, reminded of the Lion King, my favourite Disney film, which also has a very simple story that has been told innumerable times in innumerable variation but which is somehow entirely fresh and fun.<br /><br />It goes without saying that the emotions and facial expressions of the actors are exaggerated, but the most fascinating performance in the picture goes to Jean Dujardin, who plays an actor who we also see \\"acting\\" in his own silent films.  The differentiation between the actor and the actor acting, if you will, is distinct, and presumably the overacting we see in the older silent movies was deliberate in order to compensate for the resolutionof the old cameras and/or film stock quality.  Or perhaps simply because they were trained stage actors and vaudeville performers who needed to be seen at the back of the theatre.  Whatever the case, the fun of the performances lies in the way the story is advanced through the acting choices used for each situation.  The choice of the other actors is interesting, and again, in the era of studio contracts, bit players would be recognizable because the same people would be used over multiple films.  Thus, Malcolm McDowell appears as an extra for all of 1 minute of screen time.  John Goodman plays the head of the studio who somehow evokes bucolic and paternal simultaneously.  And Berenice Bejo, the female lead, is so delightfully open and naive-looking that we buy into her seeming cluelessness in dealing with the proud older man.<br /><br />Therefore, I enjoyed the film.  It is perhaps the best \\"first-date\\" film I can think of.  This DVD has some extras on it, perhaps of some interest to cinephiles and/or upcoming filmakers.  So overall a 4/5 rating, which I give to films that I enjoyed, but don't feel the need to see over and over again.

0316056871|5.0|Bossypants is perhaps a little short on facts but feels like it is long on the truth.  Tina Fey is the consummate storyteller, effortlessly weaving together amusing anecdotes, and I'm sure she would not let something incovenient like facts come between her and the story.  This is not a criticism - the truths that we learn about show business in general, and its comedy arm specifically, are worth the occasional poetic license.  Of course, having just read that last sentence it makes the book sound self-important and dull!  Rest assured, gentle reader, that this is the fault of the reviewer and not of the book he is reviewing.  Bossypants is consistently funny through its too short running time (covering a mere 300 pages).  This is one of those books that you can pick up and put down over and over, you can start reading anywhere for a couple pages at a time, but if you're anything like me you're likely to read as long as possible as often as possible until you finish it.  Then I wouldn't be surprised if you started reading it again, or at least flipping through to your favourite parts and reading them to your spouse/coworkers/dog/whoever is nearby.<br /><br />There's really not a lot more to say.  If you think 30 Rock is funny, or if you liked Weekend Update when Fey and Amy Poehler hosted, you'll like the book.  Personally, I think 30 Rock is the funniest thing on TV, so I loved the book.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|Another well written book from George Martin. The pace changes dramatically from previous books, as most of the chapters are from lesser characters or those we've come to dislike, or even find annoying, such as Cersei or her daughter, though there is the odd chapter from Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly.<br />This emphasises the lessons we learned in earlier books that even the heroes die in the game and that every piece has its part to play, so you better keep your eye on all of them!

B008IZYWXU|5.0|The 4-disc set is stunning. It's an elaborately detailed release that, among other things, documents an amazing collaboration. Queen/Mercury fans know the story of how Freddie Mercury came to create this album of various duets with Spanish opera star, Montserrat Caball&eacute;. The main focus of this 25th anniversary edition is the replacing of the original synthesized score with a full 80 piece orchestra. It works. A lot of work was put into this, from trying to match the feel of the original backing tracks to replacing the faux-Japanese koto in \\"La Japonaise\\" with the real thing. You can complain all you want about the intent of this project but, to me, it finally sounds finished. As early Queen albums proudly announced, \\"No synths.\\" The original version is still available but it's been solidly thrashed by this 2012 version. The people behind this project - some of whom were there when the original album was created - make a strong case for this being what Mercury would've wished for. I suppose the best evidence is a simple one: it sounds better. Mercury and Caball&eacute; sound absolutely more natural with a huge orchestra backing them up.<br /><br />VERY special mention has to be made of two soloists on one song. There is no call for a Brian May-style solo on this album, since the original had no guitar work. However, \\"How Can I Go On\\" has a part for drum and bass guitar. The drums are played by Rufus Taylor - Roger's son - and the bass guitar part is played by John Deacon, taken from the original release; you don't replace or mess with something like that.<br /><br />The first disc is the new album. The second disc is full of the sort of demos and alternate takes that make this release a document of how the album was created, not just a \\"for fans only\\" montage of outtakes. Among the tracks are Mercury's demos of several songs in which he sings both his AND  Caballe's parts, often improvising wordless vocals for as-yet-unwritten lyrics. I  won't bother you with a track-by-track description of this disc. But, there are a few surprises to anyone familiar with the album, these are not musical scraps. Hearing Caball&eacute; rehearse \\"Ensue&ntilde;o\\" with Mike Moran on the piano is a special treat. This is a great little art song. At a little under 40 minutes, disc two doesn't overstay its welcome.<br /><br />The third disc is a DVD and it's full of treats, lots of them. Besides a smallish documentary about the making of the original album and the new version, there are very good looking transfers of the promotional videos done in the 1980s. They look good, although the original promotional video for \\"Barcelona\\" (the song) looks very mid-80s MTV-ish. More on this in a bit. As you would hope/expect, the videos employ the new orchestral score. This makes the performances of Mercury and Caball&eacute; even more vivid (\\"No synths!). You might say this is after-the-fact tampering and dishonest but the originals were lip-synched to begin with, so why not take this to the logical conclusion and add the new orchestral score? That's what show business is all about.<br /><br />The original videos were done in the 4:3 format of 1980s television. I am grateful that this is how these videos are presented here, with one exception. When you go from a square-ish to a modern widescreen format, you either need to leave black areas at either side of the screen or chop off the tops and bottoms of the image. That latter option can completely ruin the original image (if you've seen the horrible chopped-and-stretched releases of Queen's videos by Eagle Entertainment, you'll know what I'm talking about). Universal, the company behind this release, have transferred the videos as originally shot. They look very good and the premiere of the song \\"Barcelona\\" in May of 1987 at the Ku Club in Ibiza looks spectacular, as if it were shot recently on motion picture stock, not video. You can kiss those awful YouTube uploads goodbye, forever! The three songs performed in Barcelona, in front of Montjuic Castle before a huge audience including the King and Queen of Spain, also look great, better than ever in spite of being shot on video. (Note: I watched this DVD on a 32\\" SONY Bravia HDTV with good speakers, so I'm pretty sure about how good this material looked and sounded.)<br /><br />A minor disappointment is the presentation of the original \\"Barcelona\\" video, here called a  \\"classic\\" video. The top and bottom of the image are sliced off. Besides making for a few awkward shots, this also means the video was enlarged and, folks, you just shouldn't do that with video footage from the 1980s. That is SO Eagle Entertainment! This is followed by the brief documentary about the making of the \\"Barcelona\\" original album and the new one. The DVD ends with a wonderful treat. The new score has been added to a newly edited version of the \\"classic\\" Barcelona video. In this version, alternate camera shots were used throughout and they appear to be from a much better source than seen before. It was edited very intelligently in 16:9 wide screen by the Rhys Thomas, one of the geniuses behind the 2011 documentary \\"Queen: Days of Our Lives\\" and the 2012 follow-up, \\"Freddie Mercury: The Great Pretender.\\" This new video has not only replaces the \\"classic\\" version in my heart, it also apologises for how it - the \\"classic\\" version - appears on this DVD.<br /><br />Finally, Disc 4. It's nothing but the new score - without Mercury and Caball&eacute; - and that's practically karaoke paradise. All you have to do is be able to sing like Freddie Mercury or  Montserrat Caball&eacute;.<br /><br />How hard can that be?<br /><br />This is more than just an upgrade to a better, more definitive version of  an already wonderful album. It is an audio documentary of how that album was made. The discs are housed in a very posh book-style case. The brief essays are informative and not just giddy mushy anecdotes for the fans. It is printed on sturdy slick paper. The presentation is wonderful. For those who miss the original photos, they are included along with others we've probably never seen.<br /><br />Some people have complained about the cover artwork and wondered how something that \\"cheap and tacky\\" wound up as the cover art (to an album they probably won't buy, anyway). I might not be as smart about art as Sister Wendy or the late Robert Hughes, but I'm pretty sure the splashy, vibrant cover art is an homage to Spanish painter and sculptor, Joan Mir&oacute; (April 20, 1893 - December 25, 1983).<br /><br />He was born in Barcelona.of Montjuic Castle before a huge audience including the King and Queen of Spain, also look great, better than ever in spite of being shot on video.

B0076UXKDG|5.0|I waited for the price to settle down on Amazon (saved ~ $200 off Nikon list price) to order this MB-D12 multi-battery power pack for my Nikon D800. It fits the D800 beautifully; all angles and contours follow the D800 shape very well. I can see that Nikon has virtually re-designed all interfaces, contacts (all gold plated) and functions of this pack (from my previous MB-D10). I verified all related functions with this pack per the manual (and D800 manual) and they all worked flawlessly.<br />With eight AA batteries in the pack, the composite D800 + MB-D12 ensemble is quite heavy. I find that with my FX zoom lenses, this heavy combination actually balances out the total weight in my hands; the same cannot be said with single-focal-length FX lenses as the weight of the combination overwhelms the weights of these lighter lenses. It will take some getting used to.<br />The improvement in DX-mode continuous shooting speed for me was slight and almost unnoticeable (even with the fastest Lexar CFs, my D800 typically stops with all buffers full at about the same number of shots with or without the pack). Please note that this improvement is only for DX mode.<br />I have not tested this together with my D800 with \\"harsh\\" environments (probably never will), but from seeing the good designs for seals and fit of this pack (commensurate to the D800 designs), the composite ensemble should stand up to \\"not normal\\" environments.<br />I've seen much less expensive alternatives for the D800 advertised on Amazon; but for me, the MB-D12 is totally worth it.
B008S0IJAM|4.0|This is another fine album by an artist who flashed incandescent in the 80s and then settled into a sort of Pop female Bob Dylan, crafting stories around catchy made for tv song structures.  Nothing wrong with that.  Aimee keeps on.  She's so California, though.  Those people so need pop culture references to stay grounded.  She should leave that area, drive around the south, find organic fiddles and mandolins, and write about trailer parks and meth houses.  That's just my suggestion.  I'll gladly be her driver.  My novels are more real than her little 3 minute ditties.  Still I like her.  You go, Aimee.

B007X4HPIG|5.0|Radio says they are the new My Bloody Valentine.  No, they share with them what all these bands share--the sound of train brakes from those 19th Westerns-noise.  But these guys are more like 21st century Sonic Youth, melodic, driven, dark.  I love it.  They pound out distortion and speed it up, mix it with dark, fuzzy vocals and it hits the mark.  It's as simple as that.  I once saw Social D open and then Sonic Youth came on the stage and riddled, pummeled the audience with waves of frenetic distortion, then Neil Young came on the stage and performed a perfunctory, rather mundane trip through his catalog.  A Place to Bury Strangers are a hybrid of all of these three bands in my hyperbolic mind.  Musically mutated genetics come to fruition here and now.  I love this band.  They have a vision as different as I remember Husker Du having in the late 80s, meaning no one compares really to them.<br /><br />They have no rivals.  I really thought December Sound came close to these guys a few years back, don't know what happened to them.  Still, this is cool stuff.<br /><br />6 stars.
0345803485|4.0|What an interesting trend the \\"Fifty Shades\\" phenomenon has become! It makes me smile for a number of reasons. First, I actually enjoyed the books. Second, I am excited that a no-name erotica writer can make it to the NYT Bestsellers List. Third, I think it is great that, when confronted with a little bit of kink, mainstream America eats it up. At a time of really repressive social conservatism, we need something like Fifty Shades to balance things out.<br /><br />Recently, though, I have noticed that it is hard to start a conversation about any sort of fiction without having people bring up the Fifty Shades trilogy in a negative way. \\"It's got no plot!\\" \\"It's demeaning to women!\\" \\"It's not well-written!\\" \\"It teaches a bad lesson!\\"<br /><br />It sounds more like a discussion about a presidential campaign strategy than in does a simple romance trilogy!<br /><br />It's interesting that the majority of those who complain about these books claim they have never actually read them. They've read excerpts and reviews, but not the actual books.<br /><br />It may be that they shouldn't read the books.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed are erotic romance novels with a BDSM theme. Not everyone enjoys the romance genre, and BDSM is not for everyone.<br /><br />But I do wonder why people who are not interested in the subject matter so vehemently decry these particular books.<br /><br />It irritates me. I don't ever watch football. I think it is boring. But I understand that others don't agree with me, and that I really don't know what I am talking about when it comes to professional sports. So, I refrain from talking about what I don't know about. For me, it is a point of courtesy.<br /><br />I think part of the desire to trash these books is the tendency for intellectual people to avoid anything that is popular. The masses are asses, and many things that appeal to the mainstream don't appeal to those with more sophisticated tastes.<br /><br />It is also true that, in a technical sense, the Fifty Shades trilogy is not well-written. But neither is any Nora Roberts book, and you don't see people ranting about her.<br /><br />I love Nora Roberts, but her style would make my English teacher cringe. Her point of view slips between characters in a matter of sentences. She randomly inserts the omniscient point of view; a device truly out of favor amongst modern novelists and editors. She repeats phrases regularly. She sprinkles her pages with em dashes as if they were Mrs. Dash.<br /><br />Beyond that, there is only a fine line separating the romance of Nora Roberts from the erotica of EL James. Both are very spicy writers.<br /><br />When we talk about escapist fiction, how much do readers really care about proper form? We want a story that engages us. We want to care about the characters. We want to find out what happens next. Personally, I think that any writer who can do that is a good writer, no matter what rules they break. Make me believe! Make me turn the pages! Make me sad when I've come to the last page.<br /><br />In the past week I have heard so much misinformation about the Fifty Shades stories that I feel someone who has actually read the books needs to clear up the misunderstandings. And so, please enjoy a little Q & A in response to the statements I am hearing about these books from people who have never actually read them.<br /><br />Q. Does the Fifty Shades trilogy have a plot?<br /><br />A. Yes. It is the love story of a man who suffers from haphephobia and a woman who has never found romantic love necessary. Both are survivors of childhood abuse and neglect. Both have found ways to be successful despite these difficulties. Neither has ever before experienced real romantic love.<br /><br />Q. Does the dominant male abuse the female in this story?<br /><br />A. No. The female refuses to become his sub, even though she loves him. Furthermore, dom/sub relationships do not tend to be abusive. In these sorts of relationships, it is the sub who has all the power, not the dom.<br /><br />Q. How well do these stories reflect the values and practices of the BDSM community?<br /><br />A. There could be a lot of argument here - probably because there are a lot of different values and practices within that community. And, I don't claim to be an expert on this particular topic. The values of which I am aware (the stop word invokes an immediate stop, the sub is in the power position, and it is more about exploring pleasure than it is about inflicting pain) seem to be accurately described in the book.<br /><br />Q. Are the characters realistic?<br /><br />A. Probably not, but since when did fictitious characters need to be? I found enough realism in all the main characters that I was able to identify with them, and care what happened to them.<br /><br />Q. Do these books promote abuse against women?<br /><br />A. Um, no. If they promote anything, they promote the concept that a woman can remain strong in her convictions and do what is right for her, no matter how wealthy and attractive a man might be, or how much the woman might want to have a relationship with him.<br /><br />A. Do people really have \\"playrooms\\" in their homes (i.e. the \\"Red Room of Pain\\")?<br /><br />Q. Yes. It would seem that some people do.<br /><br />Q. Do these books encourage deviant sexuality?<br /><br />A. These books may spark the imagination and encourage people to more fully explore their sexuality.<br /><br />Q. Is that a bad thing?<br /><br />A. No.<br /><br />The bottom line is this. Some people read Penthouse for the articles. Some people read erotic novels because they enjoy a good romance story. Fiction can be a mindless entertainment, but what's wrong with that?<br /><br />Romantic fiction isn't for everyone. Erotica isn't for everyone. BDSM certainly isn't for everyone. But, at sales of more than 51 million copies for the first book alone, these books are definitely for someone! So why judge? Let's celebrate the fact that, in a diverse world, there really is something for everyone!

I'd recommend it for anyone with an interest in the details of the Osama raid ( because, man, are there a lot of details in this book). The beginning may seem a little slow, but it's important to show you what a SEAL's life and work is like so that the details of the raid aren't broken up by explanations. That being said, don't be hoping for incredible military secrets; despite the Pentagon's public outcries, whatever is classified as not really apparent to me.

0812992784|4.0|The promotions for this book seemed to indicate that it was solely about Rushdie's period of being in hiding from the death sentence issued by the Ayatollah Khomeini.  The first 140 pages of this detailed memoir, however, cover Rushdie's entire life leading up to The Satanic Verses. So it's not about just the Joseph Anton period.  Rushdie's writing is languorous, dreamlike, digressive, reflective, recursive. It's written in third person and moves fairly slowly, with internal ruminations, flashbacks, and changes of time and place.  If you were looking for a fast-paced drama about being a wanted man, this may not be exactly what you were expecting.   If you are interested in the whole of Rushdie's life, then go for it. If, on the other hand, a very heavy, 633-page languorous epic about 55 years of a man's life may not interest you quite as much, you may perhaps want to consider getting the paperback edition, or get it on Kindle where it doesn't weigh 3 pounds.  All that said, the book is very enjoyable and well written and intriguing. Eloquent, magisterial, and quite enlightening. A masterpiece in its own right. A most impressive work.
B008RYN44U|4.0|Eleven years is a long, long wait between records, and its duration can be felt clearly as \\"Push and Shove\\" pleasurefully passes through the speakers, yet No Doubt have managed something very special with it - an album that plays not just as a new beginning, not just a reverential nod to their SoCal ska roots, but a solid, deliciously ambitious set of 2012 pop that follows up 2001's \\"Rock Steady\\" rather aptly.<br /><br />\\"Settle Down\\" kicks off the album ideally, humbly underscoring their veteran status not only with its lyrical content but a jangly, tuneful melody that recalls their 90s output.<br /><br />\\"Looking Hot\\" follows suit with its beats and production swirling giddily as Gwen Stefani unabashedly shares her insecurities of creeping toward middle age. Once again, her work with the boys proves more probing and personal than her side projects have, solo or otherwise.<br /><br />Sizzling hits lurk all over the album. The stirring \\"Easy\\" and \\"Gravity\\" pulse and shimmer with grabbing choruses, intoxicating production and Stefani's nuanced vocals, the title track is carnivalesque with its juicy, horn-heavy arrangement and featured guests Major Lazer and Busy Signal, while \\"One More Summer\\" is rife with just the right brand of outsized pathos to stir up the proper emotions.<br /><br />\\"Push and Shove\\" proves itself aptly-titled - it will satisfy diehard fans of No Doubt's entire discography, but it will also manage to please casual listeners - even those of Stefani's ultimately frivolous solo work - without pandering or making concessions of any kind.<br /><br />Without fail, No Doubt still sound hip, inspired and vital, but a certain sense of maturity and ensuing self-realization work their way in to the songwriting and presentation. Their type-A, in-your-face quality is dialed down ever so slightly, and it is to their credit that they subtly acknowledge their newfound veteran status. They neither lord it over their listeners nor downplay it in a vain attempt to fit in with the new kids on the block - a rare, elegant feat.<br /><br />Indeed, as Stefani sings on \\"Heaven\\" with her signature breezy cool, \\"I know it's never gonna be the way it was. How can it?\\"fit in with the new kids on the block - a rare, elegant feat.<br /><br />Indeed, as Stefani sings on \\"Heaven\\" with her signature breezy cool, \\"I know it's never gonna be the way it was. How can it?\\"
B008MG1E4A|5.0|First I want to say, I am a military wife, therefore, I don't feel that this Seal should have told the story -- he was bound by silence and there it should lay.<br />Having said that, I found the book most interesting -- it explained sooooo much.  Yes, Osama was a coward, sad the President Obama invited the Seal's for a beer at the White House -- silly President , two things most important was the helicopter, the news media made it sound like the Seals just left it with all the equipment in it and nothing destroyed.  At that time I could not believe it -- now I know, the news media was wrong and all was destroyed.  The other item -- whether we know what they do or not -- I am proud to know that the USA has men , like the SEALs , helping to save our country.
B00418NVMQ|5.0|Wow!!!  Lzzy Hale is the best female vocalist to arrive on the rock scene within the last 25yrs.  Amazing live performance that leaves you wanting more at the end.  Band is extremely polishied and tight.  Brother Ayejay Hale is an amazing explosive drummer that clearly shows his roots with a style that show varying degrees of Tommy Lee, John Bonham, and a little Bun E. Carlos.  Listen to and watch at your own risk because this band is \\"Extremely\\" addictive.  Awesome, Totally Awesome!!!!!!
B008I3QZKU|4.0|The latest The Killers album has received mixed reviews. Some say it's not hard driving and too soft.  True, it isn't as hard as the band's earlier work and heavy on ballads. That's not a bad thing, though.  It makes for a reflective and emotion baring album.  There are some strong songs on the album, some that are decent. None of the tracks are bad.<br /><br />Like the band's other albums, \\"Battle Born\\" features lots of 80s influence. It's a unique mix of synth-driven New Wave, Bruce Springsteen heartland rock, and modern indie rock.  More of the latter two, though.  As a fan of synth-driven rock, this is disappointing.<br /><br />Most fans (including me) would agree that the best songs on the album are \\"Flesh and Bone\\" and \\"Runaways\\".  Those are also the hardest-driving tracks.  I think \\"Here With Me\\", \\"Deadlines And Commitments\\", and \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" round out for the top five tracks on the album. \\"Flesh and Bone\\" is the most New Wave track, and makes the most use of synths.  \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\" is the best mid-tempo track.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of the songs rank as good as my favorite The Killers songs: \\"Somebody Told Me\\", \\"Human\\", and \\"Read My Mind\\".  However, it's a good album overall IMO and most The Killers fans who aren't picky will agree.<br /><br />(4 out of 5 stars)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is fun. trust me you'll spin bunch of hours playing this game and its just like the one at arcades but one good side is that you don't lose any money.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Excellent account by the Tier One Operator of his time with Seals. He pays attention to the Team and contributions go to ex servicemen. With regards to disclosure, it is not an issue that should deter you from this book. The book is security conscious with regards to its content. He is only doing what many high ranking Generals have done before. Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put it down; each book made me want to read the next.  I could not understand what all the hype was about, after reading all three books I SEE!!!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved this book. It was so different, fun, sad, but never mawkish. Such an interesting idea to have it written by a dog! Not a girly book by any means, but you will need your Kleenex.
B004S9AK3G|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed all characters And plots. Decades pass as you read and still engrossed in the story. Romantic, dramatic, clever. .
B000I3PERS|5.0|Awesome characters and dramatic storyline propel this movie to the top of list for both action and historic genre. Story includes dramatic beginning of Scotland history and continued fight with Kings and Lords exploiting the common man and each other.
B005LAJ212|5.0|\\"Revenge\\" is a beautiful soap opera about beautiful people in beautiful settings doing indescribably ugly things.<br /><br />Emily Thorne (Emily VanCamp) is a pretty young socialite buying a house in the Hamptons - Emily doesn't paint a very vivid picture of her past to her new neighbors, but she essentially wants to be seen as a girl-next-door type. However, Emily's hiding a secret plan to take all of these people down. Her father was convicted over a crime he didn't commit by the Graysons - crooked businessman Conrad and his wife, the quietly destructive Victoria, played fabulously by Madeleine Stowe.<br /><br />While Emily moves quietly forward in her master plan, not every one of her targets is killed. Often, she will see to it that her victim is publicly ridiculed and disgraced, just how she once felt. Once she discovers that the Graysons aren't just responsible for her father's incarceration, but also his death, the gloves quickly come off. Emily isn't completely cold-hearted, however. She falls in love with Daniel Grayson, the prodigal son, and she reconnects with a childhood friend, Jack, who owns a local watering hole. Emily has since changed her name, and her appearance. Jack doesn't know who she really is, and a subtle love triangle is created.<br /><br />Gorgeous cinematography of The Hamptons (or where ever the set was that the production department dressed up as the Hamptons), provides for a sense of escapism, but you know that awful things are happening behind closed doors. Scandals are everywhere; and you never really know what anybody's true intentions are.<br /><br />While this first season of \\"Revenge\\" in no way wraps up the saga of Emily's revenge, so many doors are opened for fantastic storytelling in the show's second season. I don't want to give any spoilers here, because the beauty of this show is the way that it starts out subtle, and slowly draws the viewer in, until they can't wait to see what happens next. In this first season, cliffhangers are abundant, but everything is done so well (in the final episode, particularly), the audience knows that anything could really happen when the show returns in the fall.<br /><br />I was a viewer of Desperate Housewives for years, and when it was announced that \\"Revenge\\" would be taking its spot in the fall of 2012, I knew I would need something to watch on Sunday evenings. I picked up the DVD of season one, and got a pretty good deal. Like I said, the show doesn't get terribly exciting until you're about five episodes in. Once that happens, you won't let go. I finished the DVD of 22 episodes in a weekend. Worthwhile characters are created, and the feeling that nobody will come out unscathed lingers in the air. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|\\"The Innkeepers\\" is a thinking person's ghost story. That is what the latest effort from writer/director Ti West (\\"The House of the Devil\\") attempts to be. He would not resort to such familiar tricks as gores and loud noises to scare his audiences. That is a good thing. Unfortunately, the premise of \\"The Innkeepers,\\" good as it is, ends up being poorly executed. In short, the film is atmospheric and sporadically scary, but all in all tedious.<br /><br />\\"The Innkeepers\\" centers on two hotel clerks Claire (Sara Paxton) and Luke (Pat Healy) working for The Yankee Pedlar Inn that will close down soon. The hotel, it is rumored, is haunted by the ghost of Madeline O'Malley, a bride who died a tragic death many years ago. Claire and Luke, both enthusiastic about ghost stories and other paranormal activities, Claire and Luke, start investigating the legendary ghost, equipped with ghost hunting gear.<br /><br />Ti West as director employs a slow-burn approach for the first hour or so, keeping the pace deliberately slow with false alarms. That is not a bad idea. Then, while he ratchets up the tension towards the climax, he also leaves the interpretation of several key events open to our imagination. The problem is, most viewers would lose interest in what is going on before the film finally gets interesting.<br /><br />\\"The Innkeepers\\" takes too much time in setting up the characters and the inn's back stories. Claire is a college drop-out who does not know what she wants to do, while Luke is a self-proclaimed paranormal investigator. Besides that, not much is revealed about them. With the arrival of former actress Leanne Rease-Jones (Kelly McGillis) as a guest, who gives a warning to Claire, the story finally knows where it should go.<br /><br />Even then, without a compelling storyline and teasing details, the film keeps us waiting for the climax that is pretty good. Until then \\"The Innkeepers\\" is all about suggestions and insinuations about what to come in the end, but the characters' motives remain unclear and unconvincing, and the suggested mysteries are not intriguing. Not saying everything is a time-tested technique to build interest and tension, to be sure, but taking too much time to do so (and saying too little for that matter) is a different thing.
B007712XAU|5.0|Plans are to watch all of this before Season 3 comes on the air..have heard nothing<br />but good reviews so will be happy to see all for myself!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|I'll admit that upon first listen, I would have given the album 3 stars - A+ for effort because it IS a Killers album, and they are as grandiose and earnest as ever. But there were no instant hooks like \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" \\"Read My Mind, or \\"Human.\\" The closest thing that came to it was the countrified \\"From Here On Out,\\" which is just plain fun!  After the second listen, it got bumped up to 4 stars, and by the third listen with headphones, it was pushing 5 stars - I know, I did the math :) And I imagine that by tomorrow with repeat listens of \\"The Rising Tide\\" and \\"Heart of a Girl\\" they'll grow on me too. Flowers continues his man crush on Bruce Springsteen. If the band is getting tired of his ode to Bruce, they should slip in a couple of albums from Chris Isaak or even Dwight Yoakam.<br /><br />As others have stated far more eloquently, this album requires multiple listens because you catch things...snippets of lyrics, a turn of a note, etc. The band still sounds very cohesive, it's not as if Flowers' has gone out on another Americana-infused tangent. I hope people give it a chance before they toss the record and dismiss it. No, it's not Hot Fuss, but then again, the band hasn't been Hot Fuss-like since that album. This is much closer to Sam's Town and Flowers' solo album, Flamingo. It's part of the reason why I liked Day & Age so much since it seemed to straddle the line between these two styles.<br /><br />In the end, there are far more outstanding tracks like \\"Flesh and Bone,\\" \\"Runaways\\", \\"The Way It Was,\\" \\"Here with Me,\\" my current favorite - \\"Deadlines and Commitments,\\" \\"Miss Atomic Bomb,\\" \\"From Here on Out,\\" \\"Be Still\\" and I would encourage you to get the Deluxe edition for \\"Carry Me Home\\" and the cheesy but so adorably sweet \\"Prize Fighter,\\" which I'm sure Mrs. Flowers liked.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I truly enjoyed the whole trilogy & found this final piece to bring many twists and unexpected turns, yet a wonderful sense of completeness I wasn't sure was possible. Guaranteed I will read them all again with great anticipation & satisfaction.  Loved every moment of my captivity!
B009329ZF2|4.0|My wife and I watched Battleship because it had some decent actors, we were in the mood for an action flick, and we'd heard it wasn't the story-thin, brainless action flick the previews seemed to imply. Well, we can confirm that's true. The story was good enough, the acting about what you would expect, a the CG were decent enough. So I give it four stars for being slightly unexpectedly better than the yawn-fest marketing used to sell it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is totally addicting.  Be sure you have lots of time to play because you think &quot;just one more coin and I'll stop&quot; but you can't! Entertaining!
B0063GORYU|3.0|I do like that this is only spider, and so takes less space in my apps. The ads really take away from the fun. There are many others solitaire apps that do not make you look at ads.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I loved this book just wish it were easier to obtain country roads. Watched the movie twice and found it to be touching.Strange situations people get into quite by accident a lot of times.This one gives you plenty of space to use your imagination!

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've always had trouble sleeping; but this app puts me out like a light! I really love how you can create your own set of sounds to save. great job!
B001VTTRC6|5.0|This is an excellent movie and so was the book.  This is a great movie for any guest at any time.
B005BOHYW2|4.0|I really loved this book, the characters were authentic and lovable and the prose flowed with ease. The flower history aspect to the story was interesting and fresh. Well worth the enjoyable read
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So much fun to play and totally. addictive. I like the fact that you always have a little stack of coins when you are off line. Prides and puzzles makes it even more fun. The review saying it's boring should relax a little bit. We all play that game at least once ...be honest now !!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am addicted. Can't get off the app. There is so much awesome stuff on there! I have already made some great meals from it and have so many decorating ideas from it. I don't know how we survived without it.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Very good acting and beautiful scenary. Set in eary 1800's this is my favarite version, this movie made me like Kyra and this is my favarite Mr. Darsy. I have watched this movie many times, and so have my friends.
B0063TX06I|5.0|The Brothers Gibb are immortal. There's no question of that. This was for me the album that really caught my ear and made me a solid Bee Gees fan. No one could have known at the time of this release that the Bee Gees would ascend to such heights, but this album was one of the albums I was listening to along with Supertramps, 'Crime Of The Century' and Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon'. The Bee Gees just write some magic tunes and their vocals are quite unique. Main Course is a fine example of how these three guys were a gift to good popular music. Nights of Broadway and Jive Talkin' are stable hits, but the variety of good listening with all the other songs on this album are just so pleasing. Kick your feet up on a hot day with a cold drink and just cruise. Or cuddle up with your partner on a cold day. This album works, because its great.<br />I wish someone would do a release of every album they ever made in some kind of package deal, cause there must be dozens of great songs I haven't even heard of their's yet. I love these guys and I love this album.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0063TX06I/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
031606792X|5.0|Last book in the series and the best, love the way Stef. pulls it all together in the end. Very easy read. Lots of action and suspense, but please read the first three books, start with Twilght.
B00136JPB0|5.0|The music on this classic is just sublime. The lyrics are uncommonly wise, the melodies gorgeous, and the singing is almost too good to be true. Fantastic achievement from such a young artist. It's lamentable that Buckley died such an early tragic death. Fortunately, he gave us this beautiful gift.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Best of the trilogy. I enjoyed the story so much. I read all 3 in a few weeks. A must read
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it.  Ready for the movie. I am sharing books and  cannot wait for my friend to finish #3,so i can begin it.
B008O037RG|5.0|Unexpected suprise! Really nice 180gm vinyl with gatefold and download card for HD Vinyl MP3-320 bitrate version from the vinyl test pressing! All for a mere $3-$4 more than the CD. I wish more bands did this! Great songs too!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|thank you for your good works.  I would highly recommend this calculator to everyone.  Performs well and is always accurate.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is my first automatic watch and so far I'm pretty happy. I wasn't sure I'd enjoy wearing an automatic, so I didn't want to spend a ton of cash on one, but at the same time I didn't want to buy just any piece of junk that would wind up souring me on all automatics. This little Seiko seems to be just the thing. I like the style, the size, the price and the accuracy of this watch. I've had to adjust it by about a minute a week, but honestly I probably wouldn't need to set it more than once a month except for the fact that I'm purposefully trying to get a sense of how accurate the watch is. Also, I've been surprised by how little movement it takes to keep it wound. I lead a pretty sedentary lifestyle lately and the watch has not stopped or slowed down once.<br /><br />So yeah, I totally recommend this watch.  If something changes my good opinion of this watch I will edit this review to reflect that...
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app is less glitchy than the actual site, which is hard to Navigate on a kindle. Even then, it has glitches of its own. But all around, this app has helped me enjoy Pinterest more.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I so rarely give 5 stars to games but this was an exception! Story was good, graphics great, and puzzles not so challenging that you can't. complete the game. I really liked this game! Keep up the good work Big Fish! The game was worth more than $1.99, and it left me very pleasantly surprised!  Thanks for providing some really good games!
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|This is as good as my Grandmother told me it was. I didn't really want to read it as I didn't think it was my thing. I don't really want to admit it but I have to say I really enjoyed it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is the last book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire.  I love this series and can't wait until the next book is complete.  Also can't wait until HBO airs season 3 A Game of Thrones.
B0091P6590|5.0|It's too bad this is only on during the Summer. It needs a better season slot. It's too good to waste on Summer.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This was a very cute movie that reminded me of my own dad: tough exterior and a very tender heart for his girls. I recommend for adults and kids alike.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|The graphics are great. A good hack and slash game. Slows down a little at times, but not enough to take away from the overall game play.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|This product was pretty good, I liked it best with the colrs. It also, had neat little apps with everything!
B008MEM24S|5.0|easy. lots of fun. I love the show game its a cute game for my nieces and nephews. and it didn't break the bank
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Yes, what the others said, it's beautiful and doesn't disappoint. Look forward to more listens and to read the lyrics.
B005NZH1JA|5.0|This is my favorite Breaking Bad episode.  Many people get killed, more than normal.  Highly recommended.  If you like breaking bad, you gota watch this one.
B0095R64AO|3.0|The movie had a couple of laughs but dragged near the end due to interminable machinations.  The last half of the movie took too long.
B003H6KRIE|1.0|As another poster has stated (September 13 2012), the Bourne Identity disc freezes in the Sony BDP BX59 which is the same as the BDP S590.  The only way to get out of the \\"freeze\\" is to unplug your Bluray player.  The other two discs play OK.  I'll now be returning this box set to Amazon and buying each disc separately.  I saw the movies originally in the theaters, and of course, the movies themselves are excellent.  The one star rating is only because one third of this trilogy is defective.<br /><br />UPDATE: October 1, 2012<br />This update is to mention that Amazon was extremely prompt in it's superb return process.  I'm still leaving the rating at one star because it's for the item purchased.  I would give five stars to Amazon for their execution of their return policy.
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|It's been called the greatest superhero movie of all time.  Whether you believe the hype or not, you have to admit: there is something undeniably charming about THE AVENGERS.  In the hands of writer/director Joss Whedon, this film is a rollicking good time--not serious in the sense of Chris Nolan's Batman films, yet not campy like the Joel Schumacher Batman films.  Fans of Whedon's work will immediately know what to expect: nonstop action blended with a strong (and quick) sense of humor, under-laced with nuanced character development.<br /><br />The film pits some of our earlier favorites--Downey Jr.s' Ironman, Helmsworth's Thor, Evans's Captain America--against Loki.  This isn't the Lokia from THOR, however; here, Tom Hiddleston's villain is transformed into, simply, a bad***.  He kicks butt and doesn't bother with names.  Oh yeah, and he's bringing an invading interdimensional army of nasties.  Can our crew, rallied by Samuel L. Jackson's stalwart Nick Fury, stand up to the onslaught?<br /><br />Of course they can.  There's no doubt about that, ever.  This is an utterly optimistic film--and therein lies its charm.  Don't get me wrong--I'm a Nolan fan, I love his Batman films, their flaws and all.  But there's a lot to be said about a film that revels in the utter majesty of the superhero, with a childlike wonder: these guys can do no wrong.  And they don't.  This is a fun, quick, fanciful film in the grand tradition, anchored by a superb script (Whedon's known for that, in case you weren't aware) and stellar acting.  Rejoining us are Scarlett Johannson (with a lot more to do than in IRON MAN 2, where she was basically eye candy); Clark Gregg (wholly ingrained in this universe as Agent Coulson); Gwyneth Paltrow, Stellan Skarsgaard, and others.  THE AVENGERS welcomes Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, Cobie Smulders as Agent Hiller, and particularly Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/The Hulk.  Some of the film's most memorable scenes revolve around the latter character, and his innate desire for destruction vs. his inner conflict (Ruffalo is partially responsible for the former and entirely responsible for the latter, and perhaps deserves an Oscar nom, though he won't get one).<br /><br />Here is the true strength of THE AVENGERS, aside from its pure joy factor: not one single character/actor carries the show.  You may think that, with a superstar like Robert Downey Jr. onboard, that he film will follow Ironman and the others will be supporting roles.  Not so.  This is an ensemble film, plain and simple.  Ironman, Loki, and the Hulk may have some of the more memorable scenes, but this film belongs to the entire cast and crew.  It is, indeed, a film in which everyone contributes--and the end product shows the effort.  Whether or not you believe THE AVENGERS is the best superhero movie yet made (personally, I don't, but that's one man's opinion), you cannot deny that it is certainly among the top tier.  It is delightful, hilarious, thrilling, and plainly fun.  You can ask for more, yes, but you probably won't get it.  THE AVENGERS delivers.  Plain and simple.nnate desire for destruction vs. his inner conflict (Ruffalo is partially responsible for the former and entirely responsible for the latter, and perhaps deserves an Oscar nom, though he won't get one).<br /><br />Here is the true strength of THE AVENGERS, aside from its pure joy factor: not one single character/actor carries the show.

B000RGUNHW|2.0|The movie/concert is great. I am sure the video is great on this Blu-Ray disc. However, the sound track is the same 'ol Dolby Digital that is found on the DVD. This is a concert film. The soundtrack is more important than the picture. I expect better from a band like U2.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|not exceedingly exciting, but rather fun timekiller. The coins have mostly realistic physics, but when pushing they tend to always go point-down
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I've never had an album by Kelly, but this one is the exception.  It's gotten great reviews, and I love it!
B008XG1X18|3.0|this app freezes up often and I have to force it closed....all and all it is ok but could use some work. it is difficult to find your own boards and is super slow at times
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Have only used the app a few times. Seems to work fine with no problems, but doesn't have the full capabilities of the PC version of Adobe Reader.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Very much enjoyed reading this book.  I loved the writing style which is much different from todays writing.  I loved the way it flowed it was very lyrical.  The characters were captivating they kept me hooked to the story waiting to find out what happens to them.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I enjoyed my time with this case and I would recommend it for the price I paid, $20.<br /><br />The case worked really well. I like the strap that will hold the cover closed. This was very useful.<br /><br />The stand worked as promised. Only one angle, but it worked well for me!<br /><br />My only gripe with this product is that it had obvious signs of wear on the corners and along one side of the back of the case after a month of use. The finish on the outside rubbed off, leaving a shiny finish on the outside. Aesthetically, it did not look very good, but to me that isn't really important. I took off 1 star of my rating for this issue.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great. It is  as good as the one I have on my desk. Would recommend to all Kindle users.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great way to pass short amounts of time. Love the fast reflexes that it requires. Gets hard really fast if your not paying attention to what you are doing. This game def. gives a good challenge for your reflexes and eye skills.

B005LAJ17M|1.0|After reading all the positive reviews, I expected that this would be a series worth watching. Unfortunately, it wasn't.<br /><br />Episodes move at a snails pace and there seems too little of interest to create any desire to continue and watch the next episode.<br /><br />The writing is weak and the program appears to have been created on a shoe-string budget. I gave up about half-way through the first season as I just did not want to waste any more time watching this program.<br /><br />The writers take an incredible leap from reality in order to fit each episode into a slot that appears to lead to a desired conclusion. Nothing that takes place in any of these episodes is believable and everything appears disjointed. Examples: If you are going to tail someone, certainly you are going to follow them so closely that they could not miss seeing you in their rear-view mirrors and, if you know a subject is going to be polygraphed, by all means tell them what the examiner is going to be asking them about so they can avoid registering an emotional response during the examination.<br /><br />These writers appear far too inexperienced to be able to write convincingly about this subject matter and there is nothing intellectual or clever about this \\"Homeland\\" series.<br /><br />A major problem with this series is that it is just too boring to complete. The characters are thin to the point of being transparent and it is impossible to care about any of the characters.  You will not care if one or all the characters are eliminated as there is just nothing likeable about any of them. This DVD is going to be thrown into the donation basket without watching the balance of episodes.

B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This is a total piece of garbage. I would give it no stars if there was an option. The game takes forever to load. It requires over 30 MB of space. It constantly crashes on my Droid phone. If you can over look all of that then I recommend you get this app right now.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I rented this season with not much hope that it would be worth watching but was hooked buy the first episode. The characters draw you in the instant you meet them, and the story line never gets boring or drags on and on. For those of you who are afraid this is a cookie cutter fairy tale series don't be fooled, this is now one of my favorite series. I can't wait for the next season to begin- watch this series or you will miss out on one of the best things out there.
B005YDLJ76|5.0|this DVD is amazing, it was new so I didn't have to worry about scratches. beyonce is just simply amazing!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book was incredible! The writing was great and the story had me hooked from the beginning. I could not put it down. This book went by fast and kept me interested the entire time!
0446581356|3.0|Gives alot of information on how makeup affects yours skin, and stuff.. although I was hoping for more styles on how to do makeup.
B0061S073A|5.0|this works perfect for my kids a four year old, three year old and even my18 month old. it gives them choices on what apps they want to use out of the ones I picked for them. volume is locked too which is a nice feature.
B008XG1X18|3.0|For the most part I like this app. My biggest issue is that it locks up on me just about every time I use it and then I have to force close it. Very frustrating.  Otherwise I'm perfectly happy with it!
B0006HBST4|1.0|Very disappointed.  Put the dvd in my dvd player, and it would not play.  An error message said that it is not the correct format to play in this dvd player.
B007712XAU|5.0|I find watching the dvds better than watching it on TV as you don't lose the storey line from week to week.
B003UESJJC|5.0|I've always wanted Hearts of Darkness on DVD and this was a good opritunity to get all three on Blu-ray it was all that I had expected a very good investment
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|21 jump street, all we know that its a refresh from the original TV series from 1987 - to 1991. I must say that this movie is preatty good considering the fact that channing tatum was more likely to be a male stud than a akward fellow that is basicly trying to make a bust as a cop. I would tell you to buy it if you are sure that u just want a Bluray disc getting some dust and unsaving household space in your cabinet.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Sure it is very similar to Angry Birds, but I think the developers really made it their own. And the puzzles are challenging, but not impossible. I finished them all with gold, and saved all the hostages. The level of difficulty was perfect.
B004QL7K8E|5.0|This movie is hilarious period. Cant get enough these teenage kids destroying a hole block just to be popular. Godlike!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Short and Simple<br />  I Missed this in the theaters, and after watching it i truly regret not seeing it on the big screen.<br />As per others with very long and detailed Reviews, and i agree with nearly all.<br />  In short as with any movie it has its flaw and great points. The great points far out way any flaws the movie has.<br />All i can say is prepare for some of the best action, Special Effects and Dialog. Oh and don't forget to tape your sides. For you will be laughing allot.<br />The Final view of what looks to be the next enemy they have to fight is a Classic Marvel Enemy, and one due to finally be shown.<br /><br /> Buy it, Watch it, Don't Nit Pick it, just enjoy it for what it is, a great movie.<br />But don't forget to watch these first if you haven't already to prepare for The Avengers.<br />[[ASIN:B005H9B44A Thor]]<br />[[ASIN:B005ZCXPP0 Captain America: The First Avenger]]<br />[[ASIN:B001LM1456 The Incredible Hulk]]<br />[[ASIN:B001FD5KJM Iron Man]]<br />[[ASIN:B0043JDUNS Iron Man 2]]
B003Y5H556|5.0|Great movie out the box. Has a very well constructed theme songs and awesome landscape scenes. I must recommend this movie for people that like fery tail and vampire movies.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book was great!  CANNOT WAIT FOR BOOK 3!!  And, if you liked this, check out Elizabeth Hunter's Elemental Mysteries series.
B001EBWITA|5.0|I bought this movies because is one of the last movies where keanu reeves is the main actor and leaving behind shya labou. Great movie.
B000FC1192|5.0|one of my favorite books great movie. it could be a bit longer though the book i mean. but what's done is done.
B00932A4XE|1.0|Very slow & boring movie. Had some funny moments but not much. Very disappointed I wasted money buying it. Good actors in it but that's about it.
037571457X|5.0|I had to read this for a class in college, and our whole class enjoyed it. Its a moving story about the Iranian revolution and the illustrations go along with the text so well
1451608659|5.0|I simply could not put this book down. If you are interested in Olympic athletes, or gymnastics in particular, this is a fascinating and well written book that will give you insight into the years of preparation, sacrifice, and struggle that go into making a champion! I have and would recommend it even to people who are not specifically interested in gymnastics.<br /><br />Moceanu has grown into a very strong young woman, and I admire her guts and courage and for speaking the truth about the the sport as it is governed in the USA (i.e. where the Karolyis run the show). She is not the only former gymnast to have made controversial comments about her coaches, but she may just be one of the most outspoken, and as a gold medalist, her words ring especially true.<br /><br />For anyone who doubts the truth about the Karolyis, you know what they say...when there's smoke there's fire! I don't doubt for a moment that everything she says about them is true. It almost ruins the sport for me, but I try to admire it for its beauty and athleticism even if my heart breaks for what these fantastic, almost super-human athletes must endure.<br /><br />Bravo Dominique Moceanu, you have grown into such a brave and incredible young woman! You should be so proud. You are someone I really admire and respect. You can always stand tall knowing you have gone the way that is \\"hard but right.\\"
B005HSL626|5.0|the app works very smoothly. the only thing is that every now and then it slows down but the app fixes itself so it awesome!
0671449028|5.0|My 20-month-old daughter loves Sandra Boynton books, and this is a favorite. Boynton's illustrations and text are adorable. The rhyming text in this book is very simple and silly as it explains how a large group of animals get ready for bed. My daughter even sways side to side during the last line, \\"they rock and rock and rock to sleep.\\" Excellent bedtime story!
B0030B0S2Q|4.0|Sam is counting the days until he can go home. His contract with Lunar Corp is almost up, and if he can just hang on a little while longer, he'll be on his way back home to earth to be with his family. After almost three years alone and isolated, he can hardly wait. But things aren't what they seem. After an accident with one of the lunar rovers, things start to unravel and suddenly- he's not alone. The movie has an interesting and cynical premise that (unfortunately) is quite believeable. The story is smart and engaging, but what fascinated me more was the environment the filmmakers created and the special effects. This is an indie sci-fi movie whose effects rival 2001 and Alien even though it was probably made for a fraction of the price. There aren't any spectacular explosions or monsters, but there is such attention to detail and great work with models that I found the idea of a single-manned mining station on the moon completely plausible. Really good movie. The extras on the DVD are also cool to watch, if you have access to them.
0679882820|5.0|I love Dr. Seuss, and I think this is one of his best. The text is a very catchy rhyme, the illustrations (like all Dr. Seuss books) are silly and fun. It's a great book for learning all kinds of sounds. Tons of books focus on animal sounds, but this one has animal sounds as well as other sounds your little one may hear often (such as the Knock Knock of a door or the Tick Tock of a clock). My daughter is 20 months old now, and she started enjoying this book from the time she was an infant. This book is fun enough for me to read that I don't mind reading it over and over, and she certainly wants to hear it a lot!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This is a gripping, fast paced account by someone on the scene.  It's pretty intense and hard to put down.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The graphics are smooth and easy to see. The animation is not overkill. I have enjoyed this app more than the Pc version as oi can take it with me.
B005POK858|4.0|This is what I was looking for. I was looking for an old school type game like Sukioden or Final fantasy. It has all the things your looking for in that style. I gave it 4 stars because I spent about 11 hrs playing and went out of my way a lot. So kind of a short game and only has main mission no side quest.
B0087HT36U|4.0|If you like angry birds, you will like this! Relaxing, but challenging. Clever combinations. Some have more than one way to win!
B000001F8C|5.0|The only thing I can say about this album is how much you would expect it to sound like Rush, despite the ever increasing presence of the synthesizers in their sonic arsenal. If you're new to Rush, this is an album you must hear. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" was the track that introduced me to the band, and it will make a great first impression on any hard rock fan. Just stop reading reviews and buy it!
B008O037RG|5.0|[[ASIN:B008NW67E0 Babel]]<br /><br />This album is as wonderful as the debut. Just be warned: if you buy the vinyl version the download files sound awful. They were obviously taken straight from the vinyl. You can hear the hiss and pops. There's also a space between the first two songs where they're supposed to segue and there are aural anomalies throughout.<br /><br />If I'm going to pay extra to own the vinyl I'd like to at least have some decent sounding digital files. I got better sounding files downloading them from a share site.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Interesting book about Seal Team 6, a group of people who work, usually behind the scenes, protecting America's interests and fighting America's battles.  While mostly about the Osama Bin Laden mission, there is a lot more about their lives, and the sacrifices they make every day, to be prepared to go anywhere in the world on a moment's notice to put themselves in harm's way to protect our way of life.  Hard to put down once you start.
B007SGM084|5.0|I have been hearing about the Fifty Shades books and now i can see why.<br />It is a different style story for sure.  Very racey and hot!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is truly a inspirational and honest book. I read it in two days and couldn't put it down. It will captivate and move you.
B008LZHA3G|1.0|Bob Dylan has a new album, Tempest, an event that would normally not interest me so much had it not been for the large portions of praise the songs and performances have drawn from smart rock and pop critics. There are some pioneers, some esteemed geniuses that a generation of record reviewers (and a generation of critics after them) don't want to let go of, let alone admit that the later work isn't as interesting as the  material that drew you to the artist to begin with. There is a problem with reaching one's zenith so early, in that everything you do afterwards is compared with the singular work you'd done years before. It's not fair to the particular artist, whether great or mediocre.<br /><br /> For Dylan, though, the generally solid reviews that he receives for his stream of albums seems an irrational response from someone who  hasn't demonstrated more than the capacity to be mysterious and inscrutable . Mystery and inscrutability are qualities that in themselves that do not make for something that will turn my head ahead and cause me to cogitate beyond reasonable length when the disc is done playing. I don't know what the fuss is all about other than it seems to be a recurring outbreak of Everything- Dylan -Does-is -Genius fever. Musically it is solid, well produced, and the musicians have a disciplined grittiness that has more polish than the cluttered and slapdash quality of much of Dylan's recent work and yet avoids sounding slick and corporate. It is obvious that sometime was spent over the sound board adjusting the mix. The pity is that Dylan is far from his best form here; for all his striving to write with an idiomatic tone his bucolic phrase making has nearly always seemed practiced, rehearsed too much in a mirror. What is obvious to me is that Dylan continues to traffic in cliches ; he is , as Lester Bangs remarked, selling off what is left of his charisma with under-constructed songs and ideas.<br /><br /> Much of the lyrics for this album seem like a parody of an aging musician long past his brilliant work doubling down on bad version of himself; there is an art to sounding as though your lyrics are from a vernacular , but the magic happens when the listener, the witness, forgets the contrivances and believes , for a moment at least, that the voices are from an era and place forgotten . This is what Robbie Robertson did with the Band; lyrics giving elliptical tales a plain-speaking, direct address from within the narrative line, not from without. There is something genuinely conversational and intimate in the best of the Band's rustic workings, no large message or grotesque  rumbles of  philosophical swell. Life is too short and interesting to try to makes sense of it and the characters Robertson and his band mates are rather too busy telling everyone what just happened, what happened before, what things were like  before any catastrophe, cataclysmic event or history altering debacle made the tides rise and the price of gas to go up.<br /><br /> Dylan wears his age as if it allows him to say what he wants because he has wrinkles you can hid your money in--he  stands apart, saging about, the voice that is too busy documenting feats and folly:  it fits neatly into the covert self-mythologizing Dylan has turned into his secondary art. His principle art, his music and his lyrics, are what Andy Warhol foretold decades ago--art is anything he can get away with. What I hear, though, is a slovenly , lazy, uninteresting filter of the creaky, eyebrow raising cliches and obvious transitions ; there are no amazing associational leaps of fancy here,no \\"Desolation Row\\", no \\"Memphis Blues Again\\", nothing as truly brilliant as the succinct parables in \\"John Wesley Harding\\";  the man who gets the credit and the blame for expanding the pop lyricist vocabulary  is now involved in convincing his audience that the contrived, the hackneyed, the severely corny and portentous are ,in his hands, masterful reworkings and reinventionsof old forms. I think it more apt to say that he makes me think of a bankrupt interior designer who is constantly rearranging the same old broken, tattered, torn furniture in a wan hope that few will notice how tacky the whole thing actuallof old forms.

B009B50QOU|3.0|I was really psyched up for this album after hearing track 12 and track 1 as singles: they're lyrically interesting and full of self-conscious bathos.  And tracks 2 and 11 play in that same territory.  So tracks 1, 2, 11, and 12 are great.  Unfortunately, tracks 4 & 5 are pretty much awful in the unthinkingly adolescent way that attaches the pejorative accentuation to \\"punk.\\"  The balance of the album isn't bad, but it's not great -- mostly strung between uninspired and uninspiring, with 9 & 10 in particular coming across as \\"nice\\" which is pretty much the worst possible adjective to be applied to a fundamentally punk album.  Unlike American Idiot or 21st Century Breakdown, there's no readily obvious structure to this album, but that's advantageous for picking the good tracks -- 1, 2, 11, 12 -- and leaving the remainders.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I was very disappointed when I started playing, got to the section that allowed me to get more items (as most games do) and the option to \\"buy\\" the items came up. How do you call this a 'free' game. What a burn.
B008BIZ06M|4.0|This album sounds like 20 years of Offspring.  It starts super-strong with dystopian paranoia, trailing into track #2 (questionable track break), and levels off.  We're into the dysfunctional relationships -- but with more self-awareness than before -- when we get to Turning Into You.  Hurt As One is the last good track before things go kind of wonky: Cruising California reminds me of Hit That, but without the consequences which were the whole point of Hit That.  All I Have Left Is You was kind of lame (going back to bad relationships), and OC Guns was an inadequate replay of Come Out & Play.  Dirty Magic is decent, but lost in the shuffle with the off-tone I Want A Secret Family.  Dividing By Zero sounds good but the lyrics are mostly lost in spittle.<br /><br />But then the album closes out with Slim Pickens, leaning on cultural back-reference and pulling the pyromania of Ignition up to You're Gonna Go Far, Kid in a track that compresses 20 years to two and a half minutes.  If you can remember The Offspring from the '90s, this track may well blow your mind; it did mine.<br /><br />That's tracks 1 & 12 as great, 2-5 as solidly good, 9 & 11 as good, 6, 7, and 10 as substantially dodgy, and 8 as bad.

B005LAII80|4.0|Unless you're a fan of British comics and pop culture, chances are you won't be familiar with 2000 AD's comic hero Judge Dredd unless you've seen the 1995 Judge Dredd movie starring Sylverster Stallone. 2012′s Dredd starring Karl Urban and directed by Pete Travis is NOT that movie. And that's good. Travis, Urban, and screenwriter Alex Garland take the character back to his roots and deliver a supreme Judge Dredd movie that properly introduces the iconic character to an American audience and offers a damn good movie while it does.<br /><br />______________________________________________<br />The Premise<br /><br />From IMDB (and written by the Dredd Production staff):<br /><br />\\"The future America is an irradiated waste land. On its East Coast, running from Boston to Washington DC, lies Mega City One - a vast, violent metropolis where criminals rule the chaotic streets. The only force of order lies with the urban cops called \\"Judges\\" who possess the combined powers of judge, jury and instant executioner. Known and feared throughout the city, Dredd is the ultimate Judge, challenged with ridding the city of its latest scourge - a dangerous drug epidemic that has users of \\"Slo-Mo\\" experiencing reality at a fraction of its normal speed. During a routine day on the job, Dredd is assigned to train and evaluate Cassandra Anderson, a rookie with powerful psychic abilities thanks to a genetic mutation. A heinous crime calls them to a neighborhood where fellow Judges rarely dare to venture - a 200 storey vertical slum controlled by prostitute turned drug lord Ma-Ma and her ruthless clan. When they capture one of the clan's inner circle, Ma-Ma overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire. With the body count climbing and no way out, Dredd and Anderson must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival.\\"<br /><br />Dredd's premise is perfect. Itsets up an incredible scope for the movie, and, for the most part, it succeeds. From the ground floor of the Peach Trees Mega Block, to the top, Dredd offers a thrilling suicide run fraught with danger, humor, some character development, and of course, some pretty intense graphic violence. Thankfully Dredd doesn't overdo it for the sake of some petty grindhouse horror-fest (though there are quite a few scenes that will make you cringe). Instead, Dredd offers a pretty good-if straight-forward-story, one that definitely revolves around the titular character, but arguably centers on Anderson. The two together provide the heart and soul of the movie, making each inescapable situation and each violent confrontation nuanced and driven. You won't find anything Oscar-Worthy in Dredd, but it delivers a compelling plot and some really fierce situations that really make Dredd work.<br /><br />______________________________________________<br />The Characters<br /><br />The use of Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) as the audience's gateway to this world is used well: she's a rookie. Not completely helpless, but unaccustomed to the horrors Judges face day to day. Anderson's main role is as a contrast to Dredd himself, the yin to his yang, providing a link to the humanity Dredd is unable to show himself. He is grim, he is a mystery, and you will never see more than his scowling lips and steely jaw for the entire film.<br /><br />This is not a flaw of the script, or of Urban, but an ode to Dredd's character that director Travis and screenwriter Garland had to work with to keep the character true. See, John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra-the creators of the character- have often said that the character's face should never be shown. 1995′s Judge Dredd biggest flaw-according to many fans-was ignoring one of the character's core design elements. Dredd represents the Law (hence his most-known catchphrase \\"I am the Law!\\") and he represents it's faceless quality. The Law isn't a person or a feeling, it's a symbol, especially in this horrible dystopian wasteland, a symbol of much needed order. Like Christopher Nolan's Batman in crime-laden Gotham, he represents a symbol, a system he believes in, to his core. Despite this (and how the trailers may seem), Dredd's Dredd isn't a one-note character, and the filmmakers-along with Urban-do well in making Dredd more than a caricature of the grim, gritty hero.<br /><br />Going into this movie, I expected Dredd to just be this unstoppable instrument of death and destruction. A focused force of nature who stops at nothing to get the job done. And to an extent I was right. After all, the character is slightly influenced by Clint Eastwood's character in Rawhide, the tough, grizzled hero archtype who keeps on coming until justice is served. But there are some nice moments where Dredd's humanity slips through the cracks, where we can see beyond the visor without ever having to see his face. Where we see he is just a man, but a man who believes in a code.<br /><br />Unlike some trigger happy hero of 90′s action cinema, he still follows the rules, even when dragging a suspect with him through dozens of floors could be a liability. When faced with critical situations he still tries to pull the potential out of Anderson, to get into her mind, to see if she she's capable of being the Judge she thinks she can be. And the ally he needs to survive. And when faced with danger, he does get hurt. Sometimes badly.<br /><br />But even beyond the violence, it's his personality that really makes the movie shine. The one thing that keeps him going, even when knee-deep in the worst the world has to offer, even when he sees how flawed his own system is, is trying to maintain order. As he puts it, thousands and thousands of crimes happen every day. And the Judges can only respond to 6% of that total number. But at least someone's trying. No matter how hard the work, someone has to do it, no matter how dangerous. And when the moment arises,he does crack the occasional one-liner that brings out the humor of an entirely desperate and tense situation.<br /><br />The biggest flaw in Dredd is in the film's villain, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). Though not any fault of Headey, Ma-Ma is written as your garden variety bad gal, the typical unrelenting despot willing to sacrifice the lives of anyone to get what she wants. But even in her we see a contrast to Dredd: she does have her own order, her own system, her own answer to the problems of this new world. Arguably, before Ma-Ma arrived was disorder, with three rival gangs vying for territory in Peace Trees. So in her we see a parallel to Dredd's Law: order through violence. But her order is based on corruption, vulnerability, and fear; Dredd's order is through hope and will. Hope that things will-bit by bit-get better. That even those as powerful and frightening as Ma-Ma can be stopped. That order can be restored correctly, eventually.<br /><br />That people like Dredd will be there even when the world ends and turns to shit.<br /><br />______________________________________________<br />The Verdict<br /><br />Dredd isn't perfect. And neither is it for everyone: undoubtedly the M-rated violence may scare some viewers away, and the plot is decidedly simple and straight-forward. But it works. And it stays true to the character.<br /><br />With some great action, good character development, a grim atmosphere, and good humor, Dredd is worth the price of admission. Go check it out.<br /><br />I give Dredd 4 Scowls Out of 5

B0097EWK3A|1.0|Im severely disappointed by this app nowhere did it say that you have to pay for it NOT FREE at all a rip off completely from the reviews and descriptions I will not be spending money on it for false and misleading information
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this film with its stellar cast of film legend. Any film with Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith is a pleasure. I also admire Dev Patel and found the story refreshing, realistic, entertaining and worthwhile.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|My fiance talked about the release of this film for literally months before it came out. We watched it on Blu-Ray on his family's 3D TV the first time and holy moly, it was amazing! As someone who dabbles in photography I was blown away by the cinematography in this film and of course the breath taking scenes and riding. Luckily, it also lived up to his expectations and we've watched it many times since. Even if you're not a serious rider, or a rider at all, you'll enjoy this film and it will make you want to pick up a board and go ride!
030758836X|1.0|Having hear so much hoopla about this novel, I bought the books a forced myself to read more than 100 pages. I found the story tedious and the constant time shift within the relationship confusing. The characters were no captivating and were generally ordinary and uninteresting. Why this book is on the best-seller list is a complete mystery to me. I just don't get it.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|This movie is a must see for a Resident Evil Fan. You've never seen Leon in helpless situation ever before. Cat fights were super cool too!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Beats me what the government was afraid of with this book.  I found it to be a quick read and an exciting tale.  If it is indeed a first hand account of the raid then it is well written and worth the price.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is really amazing. It provides me with instant access to all my notes, wherever I may be the world. I can easily create a new note and place into one of many folders I have made for easy access later on. No matter what's on your mind, Evermore is there to assist in keeping it available for you to enjoy later on and edit with ease and if you so choose, sharing it with the world.<br />Try it out,  you wont be disappointed.

B000NQRE1E|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, mostly because I'm a huge Titanic buff. I own the previous DVD versions and have seen it more times than I could count. I, of course, saw it in theatres in 3D and was blown away and bought the bluray as soon as I could. The clarity of this restoration and clarity is mindbogglingly amazing. If you are a fan of this movie or a Titanic buff this is a must have, you haven't experienced this movie until you've experienced it like this.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|3.75 star actually - Extra! Extra! Read all about the secrets of the universe.<br /><br />After several false starts I finally made myself continue this book by doing it as a buddy read.  It was this time around that I figured out why I had such difficulty.  Both the semi-formal speech and the heroine herself proved to be a challenge for my personal taste.<br /><br />In the world of Diana Bishop (witch) and Matthew Clairmont (vampire) most of the character contact is between any combination of demons, vampires and witches with a sprinkle of humans as they exist in the human realm.  These factions (each for their own reason) vie to obtain more information about the coveted and legendary manuscript Diana has mysteriously and unwittingly opened while researching facts for a speech.  Is Diana really the key? Why would a witch conspire with a vampire? What does this mean for demon-kind?  What secrets does the manuscript actually hold?  These questions and more are the basis for the origin story of this unique series.  Definitely paranormal and urban fantasy elements and most definitely elements that are solidly in the suspense genre.<br /><br />Overall it wasn't a bad read it just isn't necessarily the read for everyone. While the story flowed well, I believe it would have flowed just as well just as well with fewer words and with a more self aware & less petulant female lead.  The idiosyncrasies and traits for the characters were well drawn and allowed to you clearly see them and their motives. The conceit that the obscure manuscript holds all the answers that everyone is seeking serves as a great bone of contention among the races. When things finally began to move they came at breakneck speed and revelations overflowed in an effort to make up for the very slow start perhaps.<br /><br /> I can definitely understand why some readers really enjoyed the story while others did not. This is a story you have to stick with to understand the rave reviews.  While I started outnot caring for the book, by the time I read the final page I was definitely interested.

B0085AQ17S|1.0|You can find the EXACT same one from $30-40 cheaper than this one. This processor is outdated and you're better luck with the newer AMD FX 6 core or 8 cores that you can get for this price (~$124) or  like 40 dollars more. You can even get a new i7-3770k at Microcenter for $230 now, or buy an i5-3570k off Amazon. Trying to help you guys not get ripped off like I did, this product is old and overpriced for it's performance. This goes for $80-90 now, there's no reason this should be even close to $120. Not only that, the customer service is horrible. I asked that when my order would ship and told me it was being processed (they told me they would send a tracking number through an email, they never did throughout the entire process), and totally ignored my question on their return policy.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a beautiful and simple game who will rate your mind and will keep you thinking. I totally recommends it. if you like puzzle games.
B006ZPJWBM|2.0|I shouldn't have purchased this. Got it not thru Amazon but in a store. If you're not at least 70 yrs old, you'd be disappointed in the old time songs.
B000MTDRKE|5.0|I haven't been rocked this hard by an album since Dream Theater's Scenes From A Memory. Messages about faith, etc aside...this isn't a sermon. It's a progressive rock album. And a DAMN fine one at that. Neal is the very definition of a true musician, equally at home on guitar, piano, vocals, and more. The guitar work on this album would be impressive even for someone who is purely a guitarist. The musicianship is outrageous but at no point does it overwhelm. The harmonies are amazing and the vocal lines are all memorable. I am infinitely thankful to Mike Portnoy for getting the band Flying Colors together (another amazing outfit Neal's in), because it caused me to check out Morse's solo stuff and his work with Spock's Beard. Every now and then a band comes along and recharges my batteries as both a musician and a music-lover, and this album did it in spades. Give it a listen, any fan of progressive music will love it.
B00006LFGD|5.0|Love this CD...good duets. Some slow others upbeat.  There are songs you can sing to so that makes it great for long car rides.<br /><br />Good purchase
B00846REIS|5.0|I love reading Bared to you.  The characters are much more developed than 50 shades.  I can't wait for 10/2 for the next installment
B000063DI9|5.0|I like reading the most negative reviews on things to get the other side of what people are thinking. For those who do not like this album musically, most say it's weird, they don't like the synths or it's a cop out and gone commercial. Well everyone is entitled to their opinion and that's what art, music etc. is all about. As far as 80s Maiden goes this is my favorite. It is as commercial as any other early Maiden album, probably less. Their talent shines through here. The guitar solos on the title track are their best of that time. The Clairvoyant is fast and in your face. The only \\"pop\\" song is Can I Play With Madness and maybe the Evil that Men Do, and both took me a while to warm up to when I first heard it.<br />To those who \\"don't get it\\", unless you open your mind and broaden your horizons, you never will get it. The story is very simple to follow and includes some basic morals, ethics and views even on modern society. But I like long songs with lots of musical changes, dynamics, odd time signatures and so forth. So, IMHO The Final Frontier is now my favortite Maiden album with 7th Son coming in 2nd or third depending on my mood. A Matter of Life And Death is the other contender for second place. For me this was the next logical step after Somewhere In Time and was an even better effort, musically and sonically.<br />I love all the old stuff too. Some simple head banging is great, but I like to go on trips once in awhile too. The same old thing can get quite boring. Their talent is there and the writing keeps getting more interesting.<br />As for remastered versions, I steer clear of them now unless the band endorses it or was part of it. Making everything louder and no dynamics is not remastering. For a true remaster you have to start with the original multi track, do the right mix and then master it. These days, if you can start with the multi track by the time it's mixed, mastering is barely needed. Audio playback, uncompressed for the masses is the nextstep. Boo hisss on the MP3.
034580404X|5.0|I borrowed these books from the public library and I just absolutely loved them. So I had to buy them. The story's pretty hot and Christian is just absolutely adorable in the special way that a female author can make a guy absolutely adorable while also be sex on legs. It's pretty special. But yeah, I dig these books. People say that they're poorly written, but I think that the writing itself doesn't matter; E.L. James wasn't going for A Tale Of Two Cities or anything. It's an erotic novel, you take what you're given. Plus, the story's good, like I said, so i don't see what it matters. Darker, i think, has the best story. But Freed is just...amazing. Especially all the little stories at the end. Baby Christian just pulls at my heartstrings. Also, the books are written how people talk, so it's easier for me to read. And it's all sexy stuff anyway, you don't want too many big words in there or you lose your train of thought...<br />anyway. great read. fun read. hot. and...i want more!
B0087JTAKW|3.0|I really like Mitch Albom's books, but I was disappointed in this one.  I didn't care for the way it developed and the ending was too patent.
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|People criticize this movie because it is so unrelated to the games and it lacks a good story. Ok, it's a movie! Why would you want it to follow so closely to the games? Then what's the point of actually watching it? And I don't think the story is bad either; its a good leadoff for Retribution.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|If you liked Hunger Games, of course you will like this book.  Some shocking twists as always, and an ending you want to know.
B00114RKT8|4.0|Nice film. And one that is necessary; in my opinion. Why great people like Wilberforce aren't globally recognized speaks to the level of shame slavery still casts. I love and respect men like Muhammad Ali and Pele. But being a great athlete (and in fairness Ali was more than that) will never compare to the precedent these men set.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is just what I needed. I love it and I love how easy it is to get to the chapters you need. Daily word is what we all need!
B007FG9LIE|1.0|The hero was  tough and fearless and totally unbelievable.  Couldn't wait to get to the end. Interesting twists and plot turn but it all seemed pretty stupid to me.  Some people may like this story but I really did not.
0525952926|5.0|I loved this book even more than I loved the first of the trilogy, Fall of Giants and now I can't wait for the next one - they  just get better and better!

B008JH5ID0|4.0|Great movie. Very entertaining. Great mixture of action, horror, sexual tension, and comedy. My favorite kind of movie. I bought it so I could watch it again.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|I just finished watching \\"The Dark Knight Returns, Part 1\\" and I give it an enthusiastic thumbs up. Given Bruce Timm's recent work, which I have not enjoyed, I was leary about this one. I haven't been a huge fan of Batman animation since the 90s, excepting \\"Under the Red Hood\\". But having him as producer, Jay Oliva as director (who did Iron Man and Dr. Strange, two of my favorite of the Marvel animations), and Andrea Romano back in voice direction (from the 90s Batman animated series), it all worked out.<br /><br />I'm always concerned when watching animation if the voice actors are someone I know well from live action. Will I be able to separate their voice from their face and buy their performance in the animation? I'll admit, I started this movie having trouble doing that with Gordon (David Selby of Dark Shadows) and Batman/Wayne (Peter Weller of Robocop). As it went on though, I got into it and really took to them in their roles. My only reservation, and it is the same with virtually every non-Kevin Conroy performance of Batman, is that actors playing Batman often neglect to make separate voices for Batman and Bruce Wayne. In the comics, Bruce wants to keep Batman's persona separate and doing the voice is one of the most important features of that. My only problem with Weller's performance is that he uses the same voice for Batman as for Wayne. It put me off a little, as it always does.<br /><br />I like that this movie moved away from the graphic novel in spots, adding and subtracting scenes and dialogue according to what worked for the movie instead of just staying slavishly true to the novel. My big problem with the movie adaptation of \\"Batman: Year One\\" was that it stayed too close to the novel and what worked in the comic book medium didn't translate as well into the animated movie version. With \\"DK Returns\\", the filmakers negotiate their way through this problem with grace, making sure that you know you aren't just watching a motion comic. This is an adaptation as much as the word can imply, staying as true as it needs to the source material while trying to be its own thing. Even knowing what was going to happen, I was still in suspense at all the right spots, particularly during the first fight between Batman and the Mutant Leader. Waiting for Robin to intervene had me on the edge of my seat and I think it was well done.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of darker takes on Batman's character, a la Frank Miller. I also believe this movie would appeal to anyone who was a fan of \\"Batman: The Animated Series\\" given Timm's and Romano's roles in making this movie.<br /><br />Side note: The funny thing about watching this is that now that it is in film format, I feel like I'm watching an abridged version of \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" which took much of its material from this novel. It is neat to make comparisons on how the source material was used for each and how it applies to each version of the Batman universe.<br /><br />Anyhow, I'm now really looking forward to the 2nd part. I'll buy it once both parts are available, just in case they do a special edition which combines both films into one. You know WB, they double-dip every franchise they can.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game but over priced at lest four or three dollers and its on xbox 360nand now kendel fire what is next
B008MG1E4A|5.0|What a great read.  Mr. Owen and countless others deserve our praise for their dedication to their profession of keeping our country safe.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read.... Finally getting the true story. God bless the Seals for there service and sacrifice for the United States of America.
B007PVHBHC|4.0|This is a very good CD, right up there with my favorites from Patti (recent - [[ASIN:B003FCKIJS Trampin]] and older - [[ASIN:B002HMHR8M Radio Ethiopia]] and [[ASIN:B000002VQQ Horses]]), but it takes a bit of getting used to as it is very personal and more of a somewhat disjointed snapshot of a year she spent wandering and writing tributes to people, places and art.<br /><br />I just saw Patti live in Portland Oregon (2/26/13) and her performance surprisingly only included 4 of these songs (April Fool, Fuji-san, Maria and Banga), but they were all fantastic and fit in seamlessly with her older material. I was expecting to hear Constantine's Dream, the latest edition of her classic building-to-frenzy ranting epics, but since her whole performance has that effect it wasn't missed....<br /><br />Banga has a great mix of songs; rocking, mellow, swirling, soothing, in Patti's unique punk/rock/trance shaman priestess way. She is a real national treasure, an artist's artist, with a wonderfully earthy yet delicate voice, and great, tasteful rock solid backing. This recording is also impeccably produced.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This is my first review ever - I think this book is worthy to write about. I didnt expect too much, just downloaded a number of reasonably rated books for some upcoming trips. I could not get this out of my head and was always trying to find time to read \\"just a bit more\\".<br /><br />The characters are very well developed, the language and people are real and believable. You have the hidden evil, the obvious good, and the main characters walking that fine line between duty, honor, loyalty and what is right.<br /><br />I read fantasy to get away from reality, but it has to feel like it could be real (except with swords, magic, etc.). This book has found a great balance. One of the best fantasy books I have read in awhile. Highly recommended.
0375507256|4.0|I read some jokes online comparing Cloud Atlas to the Kevin Bacon game. I see that. Also, a critique on the book jacket from Michael Chabon called it a series of nested dolls or Chinese boxes. Those are both apropos. To me, it was a mountain with a series of plateaus on the way to the peak. There are six short stories. The first one starts in the 1800s. Each new story progresses through time until the sixth story which is set in the future after the fall of modern civilization.  Each of the first five short stories stops in the middle at the height of action and leaves the plot hanging, hence the plateau. I reached the plateu only to see I had to start climbing all over again. This is why it took me a while to get into the book. The sixth short story is the peak. It begins and ends with no interruption, and then it's a pretty fast slide down the other side of the mountain, picking up the same short stories in reverse chronology and finishing them from where they left off.<br /><br />Each story is related to the one before it (or after it, once you've summited the peak). This is where the nesting doll metaphor comes in. The first story is a journal. The second story is a series of letters in which the author references reading the journal that was the previous story. The third story is where we meet the person to whom the letter writer in the second story was writing his letters (blow your mind?) and he befriends a investigative journalist. The fourth story is about a publisher who reads a manuscript that is a detective novel about the investigative journalist in story three. The fifth story has a character who sees the story of the publisher when it is shown to her as slightly comedic movie. The sixth and penultimate story is about post-apocalyptic society who worships the character in the fifth story as a goddess. So, were the other characters real or just characters in someone else's novel or movie? Ooooh, deep thoughts.<br /><br />I finished it. I liked it. It entertained me and made me think. Mitchell showed talent in cross genre writing (historical fiction, thriller/mystery, comedy, science fiction, post apocalyptic dystopia) It, however, did not rock my world. I didn't want to hug it and carry it around with me for a few days because of a fear of separation anxiety. Some books have left me feeling that way.  This is not one of them. I'm looking forward to the movie. The trailer looks pretty accurate except for the heavy hand on the romance factor.  If there was one genre Mitchell put on a strict diet in the book, it was romance. But who is going to waste Halle Berry on a movie with no love story?
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It's a great book, you never want to stop reading it! Christian Grey gets sweetier and sweetier as you read the three books. It's totally worth it!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so addictive. I spend so much time on it. also the fact it is FREE is amazing great app :)
B00000099Y|5.0|I got this CD for my birthday awhile back. The song \\"stink fist\\" is awesome! The cover to this album is pretty cool too. But overall its a pretty good alternative metal album, not as great as \\"undertow\\"(In My Opinion) but still worth buying.
B008H5J510|1.0|I really loved the movie and I expected to because I am a mega Katy Perry fan. It was very inspiring and it was a really great movie. But what bugged me was that i spent about $35 on it and what I got in the mail was the movie in a cracked case. What really bugged me more was that it says clearly on the back \\"special features\\" with the blu-ray disc, but when I look through the main menu, I  find nothing but settings, scenes, and the movie. I feel I should be getting a refund for that because I didn't get all that I paid for.
B000002U88|5.0|\\"The Distance\\" by Bob Seger, remastered CD, was great.  However, I did have one problem - it would not play on my stereo CD player in my home. It played in my car and it played in my computer with no problem; however, it would NOT play on my CD player.
B007H51DQG|5.0|Although not the most exciting episode,it was emotionally intense. I love the mix of horror/soap opera element the show provides. Still planning to check out the graphic novel.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|This is a very enjoyable movie, quite true to the book.  The Blu-ray format is a fantastic  way to watch a movie!
0345522478|3.0|I zoomed through this book in two days during lots of sitting in trains.<br /><br />It was fast-paced enough to keep me reading it (if I am bored by a book while traveling I would rather stare at the wall or randomly surf the internet, so it means something that I didn't stop reading).<br /><br />I kind of liked the main character and the take on all the different gods playing roles in the story, and the character being a druid is something a little different so that made it interesting. He also throws in other supernaturals like vampires, witches, werewolves and demons.<br /><br />However the book is a pretty light, superficial read. There is no depth of character, everything feels pretty one-dimensional and the graphical descriptions I found somewhat lacking. If he is such a dangerous enemy, I'd have hoped for a little bit more arse-kicking in the fight scenes (the description does promise good arse-kicking).<br /><br />In addition scenes involving sexual interests (I'll be vague here as to not accidentally spoil anything) are pretty juvenile. Basically someone gets naked and he gets interested and can't help himself, and then cut scene. It really feels like a book for young adults.<br /><br />I read the intro for the second book, if I get in the mood I may read it.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for someone who likes urban fantasy and is in the mood for some really superficial light entertainment.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I saw this movie four times in 3D and pre-ordered the BluRay to get it on release day. It has humor, adventure, fantasy, a love story and an ending with a twist. Taylor Kitsch is a hunk and a great actor and Willem Dafoe's character is fantastic. I really hope there will be a sequel. This story was the inspiration for Star Wars!
B0000024UF|4.0|The musical style of this record falls within the template stylistically of the first two records: Songs (1968) & Songs of Love & Hate (1969). In a business where repeating yourself stylistically might be considered a bad thing, this is not always the case. Best moments include: Tonight Will Be Fine, The Butcher, and You Know Who I Am and The Story Of Isaac is just incredible. This is primo Cohen my friends...GET IT
B0091XRL86|1.0|Started watching this with two kids.  5 and 8.  They both asked to watch something else after about twenty minutes into it.  So I don't know If it got better but out didn't start out good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Fantastic reading, I did not want to put the book down.  Reading first hand how much training it takes to become the best only solidifies how important these men are.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|The xx's second album, Coexist, is a different album than the band's breakout album XX. Lyrically and musically the album is a great listen. I will admit, after the first time through Coexist, I was a bit torn; I wanted it to be a continuation of XX but it wasn't. However, after a second and third listen, I found that the album was very well-developed and in-line with what I've come to look for from this young band. While I know others have panned this album, I suspect part of the issue is that this isn't XX part 2. Although, in my opinion it is a great album, and would recommend it.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|I have watched this movie several times, and still look forward to seeing it again. While it is of course about guitarists, there is a very strong, positive message (not even concealed) behind the story, which is very much about creativity, passion and professionalism. I recommend this to anyone working in a creative field who is sometimes in need of an energy boost. Even those who definitely do not like rock music should at least consider this, since it is not just about the music.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I had a feeling after their first album, Sigh No More, that I would be a fan of these guys for life.  However, the dreaded sophomore slump has bitten more bands than not.<br /><br />Like everyone, my first exposure to the new album was the song/video for \\"I Will Wait\\".  When I first heard this song I was a little...hesistant. Not to say that this is a bad song, because it is not.  I hoped that it would be the weakest on this album and it may be.<br /><br />I have listened all the through twice and these are a few impressions.  If you liked the first album you will like this one as well.  These guys seem to be sincere and take care to craft wonderful songs.  I like these 2 albums because I can picture just sitting in the room with these guys while they are playing-  that is the way the recordings make me feel.<br /><br />There is not a song in the bunch that I would/will skip.  Pick this album up and spend a couple extra bucks for the deluxe.  You will not be disappointed.  Thanks for this musical gift guys...the wait was worth it.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|In one of the special features on the Blu-ray, director Makoto Kamiya says he was aiming for a \\"Resident Evil 4\\" Leon and that he wanted to put Leon through hell. That is the perfect way to describe Leon's journey throughout \\"Damnation.\\" The Las Plagas virus is now being used for war tactics and utilized in ways that have yet to be introduced in the games. What's great is that \\"Damnation\\" throws you into the first person perspective and makes you feel like anything can jump out at Leon and attack him at any moment. The renders as well as the computer animation are crisp and fluid at all times, especially the hosts of the Plaga, the Lickers, and the Tyrants. The only time it looks awkward is when people talk for long periods of time. You begin to notice that their facial expressions don't seem as natural as they should be, but it's easy to overlook.<br /><br />The lighting in the movie really stands out, especially in the basement sequence and whenever Leon picks up a flashlight. It's just done so well, feels natural, and even helps add tension at times. \\"Damnation\\" can pat itself on the back for actually utilizing the slow-motion effect properly. Lately it seems like most Hollywood pictures use slow-motion for the most pointless sequences like when someone is just standing there in the rain or when somebody turns around. The slow-motion scenes in \\"Damnation\\" actually enhance the story and action sequences. There are effects that come out at you better than most movies that are released in or post-converted to 3D and released in theaters; there's some really amazing headshots including one where Leon shoves a crowbar through somebody's skull, a table being flipped over and a cup of tea flying at you, a water jug being kicked in your face, and the tongue of a licker jumping out at you.<br /><br />The story is written in a way that seems intelligent, pulls you in, and feels like it coincides in the same universe as the games. While the screenplay isn't perfect and kind of misses its mark at times (the JD character, Leon's lame one-liners, the final speech Leon gives Buddy), it more than gets the job done and even gets pretty emotional at times.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" is the perfect reminder of how great this franchise really can be and is an ideal lead-in to \\"Resident Evil 6\\" due out October 2nd. If you'd lost faith or had been purposely distancing yourself from the atrocity that is the live-action movies (and if that's the case no one could blame you), \\"Damnation\\" is the movie for you as its predecessor \\"Degeneration.\\" These CG motion pictures are what everything \\"Resident Evil\\" fans wished the movies would have been. Smart, bloody, well-written, and incredibly creepy, \\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" more than lives up to the \\"Resident Evil\\" name.<br /><br />Special Features include The DNA of Damnation (a thirty-minute making of featurette), Las Plagas: Organisms of War (around seven-minutes, be sure to watch this if you have any remaining questions after the movie), a six-minute Gag Reel, game trailers for \\"Resident Evil 6,\\" \\"Devil May Cry,\\" and \\"Dragons Dogma,\\" and a Conceptual Art Gallery which is exclusive to the Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"Resident Evil: Damnation\\" will be released on single-disc DVD and Blu-ray this Tuesday, September 25th.

B008602KQI|5.0|This story is by far the best story line I have read in a long time.  I have this book in audible version as well as in hard cover, kindle edition and now motion picture. On the audible version of the final book, Suzanne Collins has a short interview in which she states the premiss of her book. Collins mentions that she had gotten the idea from the story of Theseus. It has been a long time since the last mythology class I had taken so I had to polish up my memories of the story. There is very much the same qualities that The Hunger Games possesses that goes along with that old tale. Children were sacrificed by being made to wander in the Minotaur's labyrinth to be killed, this was the entertainment to those who gathered the children, just like the Capitol in The Hunger Games. It really bothers me when people won't give this story a chance because they automatically think that this is a sick twisted story of children killing children. Yes, that is part of the story, but the children are pretty much forced to kill each other until a young girl who has the courage to stand up to the creators of the games and help society turn things around for the better. There is so much in this story and the one thing I feel we should all take from it is that a rebellion or change can't happen by just one person but with many people. Just like there are things in the news that we watch and/or read about, if we don't act together we can't make a difference in the world we live in. I recommend this movie and the book(s) from which it was adapted. Watch and read with open eye and don't judge a book by its cover. If you don't open yourself up to something new you are only hurting yourself. Don't be afraid to try something new.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The first chapter tested me thoroughly. I'm glad I stuck with it, because the subsequent reading was intense and brilliant.  I did have to go back and read a chapter over for clarity and continuity but overall I enjoyed the adventure.
B0087HT36U|5.0|I find this game more addictive. then Angry Birds. Hoping there will be more levels soon although there are currently 4 chapters with 63 levels each.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|it's a fun way to waste some time. I do wish there was a way to get more coins without buying them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|i have loved having this app. at my disposial it has been usefull on many occations<br />i would reccomend this app to all my kindle fite friends and if other friends who use tablets that this app works with.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|well I had a youtube downloder but it stiled working so I got this one and it works great! a lot of ppl are saying there's a bad update but mine hasn't said anything about that. and I heard some ppl say there were p*rn adds but I haven't seen any..... all and all it works great!
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|the game was actually pretty good. the graphics were beautiful and the puzzles were tricky but fun to figure out. on my kindle fire I had to hit the direction button a few times to go to the next screen, but that was the only issue. I really enjoyed playing it!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book popped up as a recommended read, and I was looking for something new, so I gave it a try.  I LOVED IT!<br />Read it in one setting and bought the follow-up and read that the next day.  The only bad thing I have to say is that I'm so sad these are the only two books she has out and can't wait to see what she writes next!
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Loved the book- especially the quizzes. Useful with spouses, friends, children,etc. Finally, why does she... why doesn't he... questions are answered!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is so fun for me and my little girl it is so fun when a big corn drops but sometimesvi run out of coins and we hot to wait but it is still fun
0375851569|4.0|One book, Two book, Red Book, Blue book.<br />We took a look. We saw a Nook.<br />On his head he had a hook.<br />On his hook he had a these books.<br />These books, they were good ole Seuess books<br />Books of cats with hats<br />Books of kids who hoop on pop<br />Even books of questionably green colored eggs<br />all here for your enjoyment too<br /><br />These books are a must for any parent who is wanting their preschool child to read for them.  This collection has a great starter set of the most popular set of books from the Seuess collection.  These are some of the easiest reading level of the Seuess books and should be some of the first of his to introduce to any beginner reader.  This set size is smaller than most publications of these books.  This can either be a strength or weakness depending on preference.  They fit well in small bags making them perfect for any backpack made for toddlers.  When my daughter goes to grandma's over night she loves to pack some of her favorite books.  The larger the book the harder it is to fit in the bag.  These are sized perfectly for us.  The paper does tear easily and our One fish, Two fish is no longer complete due to toddler wear down.  Past Seuess publications are given better binding and higher quality paper.  For that I rate an otherwise perfect product only 4 out of 5 stars.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|He makes a good case for just jumping in and going it alone. I wish he has some more helpful hints on how to decide on a good product. But overall well done, lots of good stories of what others have done to gain their independence from corporate american.
B0069G5Z9K|1.0|At some point it just says no more missions available, so all you can do is just collect coins. Also it didn't recognize I had finished a mission I had.
B004GYY714|5.0|I originally got this app in hopes that I could successfully listen to international radio, and I discovered it had so much more to offer! you can search genres and save favouriye stations, you can even search names of Artists and Groups and the channels that are playing them right now come up! wonderful radio app. A must for anyone who likes local /international Music and talk!
B009AJDDQU|4.0|My first review posted here was negative. I saw it in the theater and was underwhelmed. But since I got the DVD, I have run it several times just for the action and must now report that I have been warming up to it. It is not \\"Blade Runner\\" or \\"Alien\\" but still has some content you should think about. Recommend for SYFY.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This app makes it pretty easy to navigate and pin things. I think there are some things that could be better... like the category menu at the topic like the site. (rather than use the back button) but overall it performs well!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book! I highly recommend it! A lot of sexual content and it is very descriptive but great book!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am addicted to doing these kind of machines in real life, so it is awesome to have on my kindle. so awesome. Thank you!
B009329Y30|5.0|The Lucky One Amazon Instant Video was a great movie. I like using amazon instant video its fast and easy. The video's are always great quality. I can watch on my t.v. or my laptop. I also love how it rented for 48 hours. I love how amazon instant video has new Releases available. I like to watch my videos instantly and not have them mailed. I own two movies through amazon instant video and The Lucky One will be another one I am going to buy. I also have used the customer support once and they were the best. They did everything they could to help and the issue was fixed fast. I definitely recommend amazon instant video to anyone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Just like the real thing. Its a fun time waster. My kids like it too. Graphics are nice and the app runs smoothly.
B000FC0OOU|5.0|Beautifully written, human drama during wartime. The horrors and the beauty of humanity under impossible conditions.<br />An excellent read. Hemingway at his best.
B004JK61K0|5.0|I installed this app because I was having trouble with the default app that came with my Kindle Fire.  Don't know why it could no longer connect with my comcast email account.  This app was super easy to set up and use.<br /><br />I like it because it doesn't use many resources, and only retrieves mail when I want it to.  The screens are easy to read, and it identifies potential spam.<br /><br />\\"Good dog\\"
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I had the advantage of reading all five books in a row (rather than waiting years in between books)<br />I would say that all five are very consistent in style and characterization<br />and there is no shortage of mystery and subtle implications.<br />If you liked the other books, keep going. Don't let these other bad reviews fool you.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|received the watch in the usual quick Amazon way and immediately was impressed by the watch. it has a great feel and look, along with the 5 year warranty it was a great buy
1455838594|5.0|I have listened to the entire fever series.  I became hooked from the 1st time, and have anxiously awaited the completion of each series.<br />I actually listened again before the arrival of another one of the books.  I look forward to hearing Danny Iced.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|very fun game. a lot like the game at the fairs. I am really enjoying being able to play the game when the fair is not around.
B009B50QOU|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan for years and have eagerly awaited this album. I was a little disappointed and worried when I heard some of the trailers for the album but I was so wrong about it. The band has a great new style but still sounds like the band the world knows and loves. Anyone who is a fan of Green Day should definitely buy this!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story really pulls you in so much you just have to get the other three books to see hoe the whole story ends. Would definately recommmend this book to anyone who is or isnt a big reader story pulls you in to the characters you feel as of your there with them.
B0099G3I96|4.0|Because different people love different things about No Doubt, it's hard to know if what I value in the band is what other listener's value.  Due to this, I'll be straightforward and say my favorite album by the band is TRAGIC KINGDOM - I've generally liked every album by the band, I was a little less crazy about the reggae influence of ROCK STEADY.  It's been 11 years since ROCK STEADY, and coming into this record, it was impossible to predict which direction the album would go.  Would Gwen Stefani's successful solo career direct the album?  Or would it be more of a group effort?  Would the band start over again with the basics, or would they pick up where they left off in 2001?<br /><br />I'm happy to say that PUSH AND SHOVE hits way more often than it misses.  This album is all over the place in terms of style and genre, sometimes dabbling in reggae, ska, alternative rock, electronica, pop, and new-wave.  The through-line here is that the album feels drenched in electronic production, making use of synthesizers and electronic-drum machines.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Settle Down,\\" PUSH AND SHOVE's lead single.  This song seems to have divided some No Doubt fans - I don't think that it's a necessary indicator of where the album as a whole goes, so if you were turned off by this song, your hopes need not be dashed yet.  The second song, \\"Looking Hot,\\" is another upbeat song, but unlike \\"Settle Down,\\" the song is covered in an 80's new-wave sound - it works - the song is incredibly catchy.  The album's second single, \\"Push and Shove\\" is another return to the ska sound that No Doubt once made its bread-and-butter with a splash of Jamaican vibes.  \\"Gravity\\" wouldn't feel out of place on a new-wave 80's compilation with its use of reverb and synthesizer.  There are a few points where the album feels less like the work of a band and more of a continuation of Stefani's solo career: \\"Undercover\\" and \\"Undone\\" unfortunately stir up this feeling.  Penultimate track \\"Heaven\\" works because it focuses on melody -- it sounds like a band effort, and they mostly nails it.  \\"Dreaming the Same Dream,\\" feels like a standard 80's synth-pop song, and it ends the album on a pretty lackluster note.<br /><br />PUSH AND SHOVE is a mixed bag - there are moments where the band feel rejuvenated and reinvigorated (\\"Settle Down,\\" and \\"Looking Hot,\\") and others that sound like the band is tired and exhausted (\\"Undone,\\" and \\"Undercover\\").  I would recommend that all No Doubt fans at least sample this record; I don't think all fans will love it, but I do think that there is something here for everyone to find.  While a few songs here will rank among some of my favorites by the band, PUSH AND SHOVE has really just made me want to go back and re-explore the band's catalog.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B0099G3MCE Looking Hot]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B008LR6EUY Settle Down]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B00943S83K Push And Shove]].\\"eaven\\" works because it focuses on melody -- it sounds like a band effort, and they mostly nails it.  \\"Dreaming the Same Dream,\\" feels like a standard 80's synth-pop song, and it ends the album on a pretty lackluster note.<br /><br />PUSH AND SHOVE is a mixed bag - there are moments where the band feel rejuvenated and reinvigorated (\\"Settle Down,\\" and \\"Looking Hot,\\") and others that sound like the band is tired and exhausted (\\"Undone,\\" and \\"Undercover\\").

B008NW67E0|4.0|There were a few things that made 2009's SIGH NO MORE the breakout hit that it was: music that was stripped down to the basics, lyrics that were sincere and not pretension, and big, big choruses full of melody. The album was a crossover hit, and for good reason - much like the Avett Brothers, Mumford and Sons seems to bring a workman-like quality to the songwriting. SIGH NO MORE was incredibly efficient, pouring in emotion into every possible second of the album. Fans of Mumford and Sons' brand of folk/alternative will rejoice at the band's sophomore release: BABEL is a continuation of the band's sound more than anything else.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the best things about BABEL is the energy of the record. Produced by Markus Dravs (previously on SIGH NO MORE and Arcade Fire's THE SUBURBS), BABEL is able to capture the same raw energy that the band brings to the concert stage. It all sounds crisp, but it remains dynamic: when Mumford & Sons needs to whisper, BABEL is softly quiet, and when the bands works up its storm, BABEL is loud and fiery.<br /><br />The album begins with its title track, and it's a great way for the band to announce BABEL. Marcus Mumford works in biblical imagery and acoustic repetition to create a fiery ballad. The band's lead single to promote the album, \\"I Will Wait,\\" is catchy and melodic, but the lyrics aren't quiet as sincere as fans have probably come to expect from the band. \\"Lover of the Light\\" is a highlight of the album -- a song full of twists and turns, nearly every moment is packed with emotional catharsis. \\"Hopeless Wanderer\\" is full fantastic instrumentation -- perhaps of the best we've seen from the band -- with some incredible banjo and great chord transitions. \\"Not With Haste\\" closes the album, and it contains a telling lyric: \\"I have no time for a cynic's mind.\\" With this, Marcus Mumford shows that he's unapologetic for the emotions that he lay bare here. I think it's a lyric that wraps up the entire album, and it's fitting that it occurs so close to the end of the record.<br /><br />Band leader Marcus Mumford could have taken the band's sound into any direction after their 2009 full-length, and instead of driving closer to pop-music, he's stuck with the same formula that worked for the band previously: BABEL is full of energy, harmonies, sincerity, emotion, and larger-than-life choruses. Fans who enjoyed SIGH NO MORE ought to love this record; those who weren't hooked by Mumford's sound in 2009 probably won't be persuaded by this record though. I would recommend BABEL to fans of the Avett Brothers, the Lumineers, and Old Crow Medicine Show. Essential tracks to download/sample: \\"Babel,\\" \\"Lover of the Light,\\" and \\"I Will Wait.\\"<br /><br />(Additional Release Information!)<br />The above review is for the standard edition of BABEL, but it also comes with a Deluxe Edition that includes three bonus tracks. These songs are: \\"For Those Below,\\" \\"The Boxer (with Paul Simon and Jerry Douglas),\\" and \\"Where Are You Now.\\" If you're a fan of the band, I would definitely recommend going with the deluxe edition for these bonuses!that it occurs so close to the end of the record.<br /><br />Band leader Marcus Mumford could have taken the band's sound into any direction after their 2009 full-length, and instead of driving closer to pop-music, he's stuck with the same formula that worked for the band previously: BABEL is full of energy, harmonies, sincerity, emotion, and larger-than-life choruses.

B003QSOFFO|5.0|I rented this movie for my two year old to watch she still has short attention so it was nice to have it rented just in case she didnt like it, she watched half of it the first day and the other half the next day but she loved it so we may end up buying it.
B008C1O8CA|4.0|I wanted to love this album: a \\"return-to-basics\\" from Green Day?  Sign me up!<br /><br />After WARNING, Green Day did something unexpected: they made a sprawling rock-opera that was politically and socially aware.  AMERICAN IDIOT proved to be a triumph for the band creatively, commercially, and critically, so it was no surprised when the band followed with 21st CENTURY BREAKDOWN.  The band started sessions for a follow-up album, but these sessions were abandoned for what would become UNO!  These two albums are good, but they were tough for the band.  It makes sense that after these more serious efforts, they would want to get back to basics: writing punk-rock songs that are fun, upbeat, and melodic.  UNO! has more in common with NIMROD and WARNING than it does with either of the band's previous two albums.<br /><br />Many of the reviews that I've read claim that UNO is a \\"switch from high-concept to high-energy.\\"  I'd have to disagree - while the lofty concepts of recent albums has been largely ditched, UNO isn't percolating with energy.  This album may be more energetic than 21ST CENTURY BREAKDOWN, but it doesn't compare to DOOKIE (and pre-DOOKIE albums).  UNO feels about like WARNING did, where some songs are more immediate than others, but for the most part, they don't feel urgent.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Nuclear Family,\\" a song that recalls some of the band's late 90's output - it centers around a nice chorus.  Early album highlight \\"Let Yourself Go\\" is full of energy, and when it gets going, it feels unstoppable.  \\"Kill the DJ\\" is a satirical pop-song (not unlike the Offspring's pop-parodies \\"Pretty Fly for a White Guy\\" or \\"California Bumpin\\"), and while it is catchy and melodic, I think that many Green Day fans will bristle at it.  The song comes close to Panic! At the Disco territory, but it distances itself with a nice helping of irony.  Compared to the first half of the album, the second half is a bit slower.  The Cheap Trick-inspired \\"Troublemaker\\" includes some nice guitarwork, and the song doesn't sound unlike something OK GO would record.  \\"Sweet 16\\" is a pleasant-enough ballad, but the band sounds bored getting through the song.  \\"Oh Love\\" concludes the album on the good note.  The song takes its time to begin, and while it doesn't really feel like punk at all, it's a solid rocker.<br /><br />UNO! is the first of a planned trilogy for this band, and I can't help but think that the band's approach right now is quantity-over-quality.  Most of UNO! is good, but it's not terrific - I'm betting that between the three albums (UNO, DOS, and TRE), there would be enough material for one fantastic album.  I couldn't help but feel like I had already heard many of these songs before; Green Day fans will probably enjoy this album, but something about it will feel pretty familiar.  Listeners looking for a continuation of AMERICAN IDIOT or 21ST CENTURY BREAKDOWN will be let down slightly by UNO, but those looking for a return to the sound of WARNING will find plenty of songs to enjoy here.  Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"[[ASIN:B009B51KM2 Nuclear Family]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B009CRESW8 Let Yourself Go]],\\" and \\"[[ASIN:B009B50RVW Stay The Night]].\\"  If UNO! is meant to be the \\"party album\\" of the trilogy, I'm curious to what that means for the next two dozen songs the band will release...<br /><br />Don't forget to get the [Explicit] version of the album -- the censored editions of UNO really take the punch out of a few songs.er\\" includes some nice guitarwork, and the song doesn't sound unlike something OK GO would record.  \\"Sweet 16\\" is a pleasant-enough ballad, but the band sounds bored getting through the song.  \\"Oh Love\\" concludes the album on the good note.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|It is a great an interesting reading. It describes the high level of dedication, training, significative sacrifice of private life means to be a SEAL. In addition, it also give us a glimpse of what happens in the real world when a special mission is undertaken, unlike the movies, problems and unknown parameters come into play (like the crash) even with the high level of planning and preparations and calculation of the odds; there are unknown situations that could cost lives.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|this is the best of them all. i do love every single book and movie about Harry Potter. I normally read books for an older audience but this still captured my heart. Read it and see it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was interesting enough where I did not want to put it down, but once you get to the bottom of what is happening you realize how very weird it actually is.  Overall, I am giving it 4 out of 5 stars because I did enjoy reading, just know that the way everything ends up is odd.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|i'll never tire watching these movies. they are the best. an amazing story created by a genius mind. makes you think!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book. I found myself unable to put it down. A definite page turner! I highly recommend this book!
1907563202|5.0|I like this book because it gives easy crochet projects (for beginners like me) and the projects can be completed in a relatively short amount of time, so I didn't get discouraged.  There are also more difficult projects to focus on once I have some more experience.  The instructions were easy to read and the projects that I completed looked like the image.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I loved the two twists in this book, although I did guess the 1st one. The remainder of this book is just an easy read that didn't really grab my attention.
B008NW67E0|3.0|These guys are good musicians, no doubt about that.  I just felt like all of the songs were very similar.  Nothing really stood out.  They were all good, but nothing really caught my attention.  It just didn't connect for me. It was good but just not great for me. Just kind of forgettable for me.
1451696205|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time.  I was Charlie's age during the time the story takes place and Perks transported me back.  It was a great reminder of what life as a kid is like and the struggles we all must face.  This book also forced me to make a new Smiths playlist on my iPod.  I'm old (40) and Perks made me proud to have experienced my teen years to the fullest.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I love every song on this album!  They are all differant from each other, and all stand up on their own.  It is fresh and new. Not the same stuff you hear out there today.  You never know what to expect from song to song.  It's great! I love it! Good for them for bringing back real music!
B001OL4TR4|5.0|Love to relax watching this movie. It is an older copy but a great addition to my library. Here is to warm winter nights.
B007FEFLTO|1.0|The price of the Kindle book is outrageous. The book may be good and I am looking forward to reading it, but at this price I will wait for library or buy a hardcover.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a compelling and fun app that is easy to use and lends itself to a lot of different projects. I have really enjoyed it since discovering it. It's my favorite social app right now because it is content driven.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Part 1, I was trying to figure out the mystery. Every time I thought that I had it figured out, the author threw in an unexpected twist. Part 2, the psychological thriller began. Every page these two sick characters' personalities were revealed. I hated this book and loved it at the same time. It was a fun read, I would recommend it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I appreciate how this book kept the plot moving with unexpected  twists as puzzle pieces fall into place or way out of place. Distrubing relationships  that  uneasily have glimpses that remind us of our own at times.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|The mic we received didn't work at all.  We thought the battery might be the problem so we tried a new one.  Didn't help.  Tried multiple cameras. Didn't help.  It was a completely useless waste of money.
0470601787|5.0|I keep buying extra copies and giving them away to people.  The approach that David Sibbet and his colleagues at the Grove Consultants developed over the years gets and keeps people on track.  Staying on track actually gets people to the project and personal goals they set for themselves.  It ain't magic but it is magical.<br /><br />I get many thanks from the people I give copies to and from the people I serve when I use the tools and techniques in Visual Meetings.
B000W91RUG|5.0|When this series first aired I thought it would be a typical clone series of Friends or Joey or the like but to my surprise and happiness I found it actually has a talented and entertaining cast who keep the series more enjoyable as each season comes out.  I like how it plays on the seemingly stereotypical lifestyles of the vastly intelligent but socially awkward and socially talented but slight less intelligent academically and not always in the same group as you would think.  Many people have wondered if the series has a laugh track like some of the early 80's to mid 90's shows, while you do hear laughter it's actually from an audience rather then a mechanical laugh track.Still if you find it annoying to hear laughter in some of the scenes then this series is one you might want to pass over, while it doesn't distract you from what's going on in the scenes more then half the episodes will have for obvious reasons laughing in them. If you're still unsure of the series I'd say get the first season especially for the price it's going for and see whether or not you will become a fan as I highly suspect or this is a series you'll want to pass over either way I still say the series is worth a try.

0439023521|4.0|I've been reading nasty reviews about The Hunger Games - how it is shallow, lacks character development and has not a whiff of political commentary about it. And that's all true. But neither does Curious George or Mary Poppins. THG is perfect for its audience of pre-teens. It's a story of survival with not too much gore, of young love without sex apart from kissing, and of a dystopian future without any grand political overtones. Sure, it's not 1984 or Brave New World. But it is ideal for what it aims to be.<br /><br />Everyone probably knows by now that THG involves the future on the North American continent. The Capitol, a based in the Rockies, is a glittery Oz of wealth and power. The rest of the continent is divided into 13 districts, which once rebelled against the Capitol. As punishment, each district must annually select a boy and a girl to compete in the Hunger Games - a fight to the death set in various forbidding terrains. The books follows Katniss Everdeen, the doomed heroine from District 12, the coal mining district, through her pre-games life as a bow hunter supporting her family, the selection, her brief training in the Capitol and the brutal games themselves.<br /><br />If you have seen the movie, the book provides little extra detail. A game rule is announced at a different part in the story, and a detail about hunting dogs is omitted in the film. But for the most part, movie and book track each other like a pair of does on a forest path. Still, the book is exciting, with peril and drama on nearly every page. I'm glad I saw the movie first. The multi-colored world of the Capitol came to life in it. But I wonder whether the movie would have been enjoyable if I had read the book first. I suspect not, unless I was totally captivated by the story and its characters. Anyway, The Hunger Games was a fun read, not challenging by any stretch, nor a work of high literature, but jam packed with high stakes and terror from beginning to end.

B0086DBE62|5.0|This was a very enjoyable, entertaining movie. Julie Roberts dropped some good one-liners as the evil step-mother, Lilli Collins did an excellent job as a Snow White who was considerably more proactive than Disney version. The seven dwarves were a hoot and quite heroic. All in all, the film gave us a very nice evening, one we will repeat.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I enjoyed the original game but this game adds new aspects which improves the level of play and increases the difficulty.  A very enjoyable game and relaxing music helps too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this calculator Oise helping my son do his math. the buttons are big enough and it is very User friendly.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this account of one of the most important operations in US Military/Intelligence history. Thank you for memorializing this with a first hand account of what actually happened that night.
1416550550|5.0|Tremendous book with character development, the frailties of the human condition, family obligations, moral obligations, and how one is truly the master of one's destiny. This is the BEST one from this author.  So if you only read one--read the Forgotten Garden!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone girl was interesting from start to finish...the characters were real and the mystery captivating...I would recommend this book to all...only complaint is the price for my kindle selection.
B004UID2LC|3.0|ugh. okay it was awesome, but then it wont download anymore!! what happened?!  it needs to be fixed now!!!!!!!!!!<br />thank u
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book exceeded \\"readers anticipation\\". The parallel between fiction/fantasy and the reality of government control is amazing.  Sorry that there are only 3 books...
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great game. I can play for hours. I play on my commute to and from work and to relax after the kiddies are down for the night.
B005FUTC86|5.0|I prefer widescreen versions when they are available, and had bought the fullscreen DVD because at the time it was all that was available (at least cheaply).  When I saw this one was available and fairly inexpensive, I didn't wait at all but put my order in.<br /><br />This is much more satisfying in widescreen because you see all the action and not just 2/3rds of it in some scenes, especially some of the musical numbers.<br /><br />The choreography is first-rate, and though the plot is a bit weak in places, as a kid's film it works well and is fine family entertainment.<br /><br />Excellent sound and video quality, though I watched it on my laptop.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This CD was received promptly and in perfect condition.  I would not hesitate to buy again.  I am new to the sounds of Adele but do like what I hear.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|ice age is a lot of fun. you have to be patient at times,  but you can play for free.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I enjoy the different melodies and depending on what mood I am in I can select a sound and each in every time, I relax and fall asleep.
B008O037RG|5.0|This is another great album from Mumford & Sons. I purchased the vinyl version and wanted to comment that it does come with a digital download card. This was a great relief since it doesn't mention anything of that in the description of the product. Great purchase, worth every cent.<br /><br />I'll repeat again so people see it.<br /><br />The vinyl of the album DOES come with a digital download code!<br /><br />EDIT: the download is of a rip off the vinyl so it does include some sound flaws in it.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|This is an amazing documentary that instantly made me rethink my ideas of food; where it comes from, who is in control of it, and how our current practices impact the environment.  The presentation of the material was balanced and made me aware of how much I assumed I knew about the food I eat. I feel this is a film everyone should see.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|This series is often compared to JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings--well this installment has put that lie to rest.  First the good points, character development and world building continue to be first quality and everything I have come to expect.  Now the bad and down right ugly points.  There are so many plot lines and so many \\"main\\" characters that the story has finally been lost completely. As a result after each chapter I was left on the edge of my seat anticipating the resolution of the events only to be repeatedly disappointed when the author inexplicably chooses to switch the topic to a different character.<br /><br />The read was frustrating and far from the relaxing endeavor that I seek in my time with a good book. I will most likely continue to read future books in this series because I am stubborn that way, but I would NEVER recommend that anyone start this series.  I am convinced that Mr. Martin is writing for television rather than to move this series along.<br /><br />One can only hope that that we do not wait another 7 years for the next installment.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|flip, land it. That's it, pretty simple. doubles, triples, &amp; the elusive quad flip, can U get it? I can
B0055PMJMW|5.0|Michael Connelly mysteries are always a great read.  Having read most of the Harry Bosch series, it was great to catch up with all my old friends.
B00633W614|3.0|I liked \\"Only Time Will Tell\\", even though it didn't come to any kind of conclusion.  I forgave the cliffhanger because the book was a fun read.<br /><br />Not so with \\"Sins of the Father\\".  Maybe it's just me, but I thought this Archer potboiler was just TOO \\"soap opera-esque\\".  You'd think that with World War II going on, and stories of prison and hordes of Germans marching over the hill, that Archer would have managed to keep some ACTION and genuine drama going...but, eh, not so much.<br /><br />\\"Sins of the Father\\" was really enough for me to say, 'I think I can skip the third book in the trilogy.'  Sorry, Jeffery.<br /><br />*BUT, I still always recommend Archer's \\"Kane and Abel\\"...a family saga that satisfied!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Movie is a dream come true!  Well written, well paced with a fantastic cast and amazing effects.  This milestone of a movie is not just for comic book fans!
B008JIFJ4W|4.0|Gossamer is a great follow up album with catchy songs you will be singing in your head all day long.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|My grandson is in love with this movie. It was the first movie his mom and dad took him to so when he got the dvd he was very excited and watches it over and over again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really don't know how to feel... wow... just wow.... love it none the less..... what's next to read? Suggestions?
B009329ZF2|2.0|Loud, flashy, expensive, interesting, but not worthy of the talent. Liam Neeson didn't need this in his back pocket. And the lesson learned? If you are the lazy, spoiled brat, you live and succeed while your perfect, well behaved, sacrificing brother bites the dust!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Such an amazing book. Hugh is a very talented writer, I'm really looking forward to reading his other books. Props to Amazon for allowing self published works.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This book was great my 13 year old daughter finished it in a day. And i finished it in two.
B0060CXAHC|5.0|Lilo And stich was an enjoyable movie.  I found myself watching the movie even thought little one had fallen asleep.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I enjoyed it. It is from the same producers that did Transformers and I loved that as well. I am a sci-fi buff. It's my type of movie, action-packed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Read the first book a few months ago before the movie came out, and became hooked. this one is just as good but suzanne collins does an amazing job of keeping you reading! i cant wait until i can read the next one!!
0780622553|3.0|I recently picked up this 1998 neo-noir science fiction DVD up at one of my local libraries. In some ways it feels a bit dated but it's a fun enough piece for sci fi fans with the visuals being the main attraction, I suspect.<br /><br />The main character, played by Rufus Sewell, has amnesia, is pursued for murder charges and is trying to figure things about amidst demigod beings also tracking him as there is something very special about him. Chosen One anybody?<br /><br />The cast is impressive even if at times they feel underutilized: William Hurt, Kiefer Sutherland, Jennifer Connelly and Richard O'Brien.<br /><br />There are several references within to history and mythology and while I appreciate such elements in a picture the tale could have been great but only turned out to be somewhat good.<br /><br />The budget for this picture was $27M and it just about broke even at the Box Office.<br /><br />CINEMATOGRAPHY: B minus to B; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS/SCENERY: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B minus to B; STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus; WHEN WATCHED: early August 2012; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game a lot. I would recommend this game it was fun. I cant wait for the next one.
B008N5UX9M|2.0|I was anxious for this and I must say my expectations were high.  The vocalist is weak and does not stand out, the music, flat with little energy.  There are some songs you can clearly tell Harris is on the bass.  I may be harsh as my expectations were high but I would not even call this experimental.  It has a couple of decent songs, but largely it is something forgettable.  A shame to.
0345535421|4.0|to say unexpected is to undertate. i am used to fantasy and its usual devices... escapist, light, uplifiting... you know... the stereotype: the good guy wins and evil is defeated.<br />martin hadn't ended his epic yet, so i cannot say that evil will not be defeated... but in his novels evil seems to have a depth and a breadth beyond what is typical.<br />cruelty, incest, rape, murder, sexual humiliation, decapitation... you name it and you'll find it here. I am not extolling the starkness of marting's world, but i am not judging it either. no wonder the producer of the tv series says that martin's epic is like the 'sopranos in middle earth'. if anything, it is far more grittier than the sopranos.<br />i am giving this story 4 stars and not 5 because there is too much details that goes no where and seems to act more as filler than anything else and i don't like authors who build a rambling chaotic complex world that goes no where ... and though Martin's main characters always seem to do something critical, there are moments when the action and the event crawl at a pace by whose reference point a snail would be considered a pretty fast creature. just saying...<br />looking forward to  reading other books.<br />hope that martin will not disapoint.
B0034G4P26|2.0|Strangely high number of very positive reviews here.  The movie was visually stunning, (computer animation enhanced claymation)  but poor in story and humor. Charles Darwin and Queen Victoria are the over the top dastardly villains in this, which should give you a good impression of the pervasive wrongness present here. A few chuckles now and again, but nothing to appreciate more on a second viewing. I'm not a kid, so I can't speak with full authority on their potential enjoyment, but I would guess it would be low. All I know is that Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run are fantastic fun every time, and this was disappointing.  Very odd sort of ironic sensibilities here (probably very British humor) that miss more than they hit and are definitely over the heads of younger kids, and a majority of the older ones as well. (also can't speak for the 3D.)  Rent, don't buy.
B002PNAY9C|3.0|It is uncharitable for me to say that all this adventure is just a filler, but really it is exactly that.<br />Not only that, but I am not getting the importance of the sword in Eragon. Would the final book explain it or is it just a sword that never needs to be sharpened?<br />I mean Paolini kind of hints that there is more to the sword than the typical rider's swords and the fact that the sword bursts into fire when its name is said gives proof to that... but what does this signify? the fact is, it signifies nothing. paolini kind of promises us to deliver meaning to the forging of the sword but he stops far from delivering anything.<br />so, if the sword does nothing, why is the book called 'brisingr'?<br />and what about the eldunari? i mean give me a break. a dragon heart stone? doesn't he see how common this concept is in pulp fiction, comic fiction, and movies... I recall seeing at least 3 movies with a dragon who has a heart stone... come one Paolini, I dare you to deliver originality.
1609611543|2.0|I've been on this eating protocol for exactly one year!! My NMR results that I got today are worse than they were before I started it. Those results in turn were the outcome of two years on Eades' Protein Power, initially, and then a Kurt Harris Paleo. The only really positive change, i.e., outside the normal expected variability between testings, was triglycerides. So, if you're gonna do this diet, don't expect your cholesterol values to change in a positive direction, FWIW, I'm male and 74 years of age who weighs 158.5 #'s with BF% of 12% and who does high intensity strength training once per week and japanese sword training x1 per week.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Game has great graphics and nice game play. Really enjoy playing this game. Recommend definitely download today.  I play everyday and night
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|awsome game. I love the arcade version and this version is just as good without costing me a fortune in lost quaters
B009B50QOU|5.0|Got it this morning, and listened all the way into work.  Must say, I am very impressed.  Been a huge GD fan since I was a teenager...still remember where I was when I first heard Dookie.  Every song is stellar...not sure about Kill the DJ though...it's catchy..but glad that I don't know any DJ's as I might want to subliminally hurt them.<br /><br />This album is very reminiscent of the Dookie-Nimrod years, which is pretty much my high school / college years.  Many fond memories... Even though GD has aged, and now have families, they still know how to rock like they were still young.  Get this album, you won't be sorry.
B008BM9L72|5.0|Good reading took a while to get into the books however some very interesting moments and I would recommend for a winter read. Would make a good movie.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|This is just the right tool you need for setting up a wireless router. There are so many wireless routers in my neighborhood and surprise, most of them jam on to the same router default channels. I just adjusted mine to an open channel and got a great signal all around the house and outside. Duh, thank god for people who don't think about these things, but for the few who really want a quality signal, this is the right tool for you. With this you are going to see everyone's signal and how strong it is and which channels it dominates. This also helps you select and connect to the strongest open signal (unlocked) to log onto (with a simple free ad-on) with your android if your not at home.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Here is a romance that will set your hair on fire!  Just a suggestion:  She didn't catch his eye by wearing \\"million dollar\\" clothes.<br /><br />Fuzzy
B007GCY8FS|1.0|I never writte reviews but I have to write this one. I own all Lee Child's books and have, in the past eagerly anticipated all new books. I couldn't get through A Wanted Man! What happened to Reacher? What happened to Lee Child? The first one third of the book is still classic Reacher especially the numbers and eye blinking games. But it all went down hill after the ride is over. The plot lost itself and Child lot the plot. I have never read a Child's book where I skipped pages like this one. The ending is so feeble I kept looking for more pages thinking there might be more somewhere.  What happened to Lee Child?
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|good read. couldn't put it down. very suspenseful and sad at the end. wished she would have ended up with Gale.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I love this show!! I lived with my sister in law who didn't have premium channels (i.e..bo,Showtime). I saw previews for this show and love it more than True Blood (I was not impressed by this last season after seeing AHS )! This is one of the greatest shows since Charmed!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The writing was a lil explicit but definitely pulled me right in. I could not put my book down! I really kept telling myself I should not like this but yet I couldn't stop... I loved it!
0385738765|4.0|The Scorch Trials is a very action packed book that continues right after The Maze Runner ends. Throughout the book James Dashner makes you want to read more. You will always be pondering the mysteries and motives of WICKED and amazed at how they play with Thomas's emotions. The author adds a lot of new interesting characters and plots that make the story a whole lot more enjoyable. You should read this book if you don't mind going through the entire book with your heart beating from excitement.
030758660X|5.0|All knitting skill levels are included. The projects take you from very basic to extravagant. There is even a special section for werewolf fans (remember, there is an old legend that if a werewolf dies of \\"natural\\" causes\\" -- see Reverend Montague Summers -- he or she will rise to a new life as a vampire). And can you resist making a set of \\"blood bottle cozies\\" for yourself or your friends? It is to be noted that all the pictures of the models are taken in broad daylight! What you or anyone else does after dark while wearing these costumes is your own affair. (And I don't want to know.)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is so fun you are on a jetpack and doing fun stuff and I never quit this game
1603429999|5.0|Did you find your great-grandmother's set of five aluminum circular knitting needles in the old cedar chest? Did you wonder what she made with those five needles? How would you like to find a whole book that tells you exactly what she did -- and how you can accomplish a whole lot more! Learn about how to use those needles with the strand of linking plastic between them. Discover that you don't need tiny needles like great-grandmother used to produce incredible socks, scarves, hand warmers, and even hats! (Do note that there is in the introduction a very practical explanation about why there are times to use flat knitting.)
B00846REIS|4.0|I have to say that the book was good but I was highly disappointed when I could not get the second book and have to wait until October. It took me less than 12 hours to read this novel and was looking forward to starting the second one right away.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Great concert. Get it! Its a great price. I received m ine in the mail today. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  definitely one of my favorites.  Nice little booklet included too.  :-)
B0055B7IPE|5.0|I don't often cry during a movie, as I'm 6'4\\" and weigh 250 lbs, but this movie did it. It's a great family movie and has a great message, too! Highly recommended
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried other weather apps, but they were always at least 45 minutes behind.  Accu Weather has been within 10 minutes all the time.  Love the scroll timeline.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This reboot is wonderfully done. The actors, for the most part, really do a great job at acting like the actors in the original series. New Spock and old Spock together on the same screen at the same time was fantastic. I hope they come up with enough money and ideas for continuation of the story.<br />good job everyone.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is really fun because you get to decorate and personalize your own restaurant if u download this game you will not be sorry
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford & Sons have done it again, another perfect album. I absolutely love every song and it will be on continuous repeat.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this version. Being able to have verses read to you is great, especially with my 9 year old.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|seems simple but there is really strategy involved - drop the coins in the right place to get most movement
B0086700CM|5.0|great grafics for nook or kindel tablet I think thks game is great for stay at home moms stimulated dads or kids who are open minded
0547564651|5.0|This is a very fine book on a crucially important subject. Paul Tough makes the point that character skills directly influence a person's quality of life, major decisions, ability to cope, and ultimate happiness. People from less privileged backgrounds need more of these skills, but fortunately, they can be developed. To illustrate his point, Tough cites many, many studies and describes many innovative programs in which people are trying to draw out these qualities in students.<br /><br />All of this is fascinating and impressive.  I was a little disappointed (4.5 stars)  that he didn't focus more on exactly how to cultivate these crucial skills in students. Until the very end of the book, it felt as though the author was raising more questions than he was answering. He does mention along the way that educators have difficulty defining  character skills, let alone teaching them. Clearly, this is a more complex subject than it appears to be.<br /><br />Still, this is an excellent book, thought provoking and very convincing.
0810993139|5.0|This entire series is great. I get all of them as they are published. My grandson is an avid reader and loves the Wimpy Kid series. A++++++
B004FRX0MY|1.0|This app uses over 20MB of main memory and can not be moved to the SD card.  Amazon needs to reduce memory usage 80-90% as my memory is now full.

B004DLPXAO|1.0|This program is using over 20 MB of my main memory and Amazon has not enabled SD card use.  I have run out of memory. Memory usage needs to be reduced at least 85-90%.  There is no excuse for the program being this big.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is fantastic - not a bad song in the mix.  Lover of the Light, I Will Wait and Hopeless Wanderer are my current faves!  If you loved their first album, Sigh No More, then you will love this one too.  I also highly recommend seeing them live!  Best live performance ever.  These boys are epic!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent read! I didn't want to put this book down, though I had to occassionally.  For me, it is all about the characters and these were well developed - I didn't want the story to end, I didn't want to leave the world that Hugh Howey created, as bleak as it is.  I might read Wool Omnibus again (and that never happens!)
0316174483|5.0|The book arrived quickly and in great condition.  It is a wonderful product and my art students drew a lot of inspiration from it.  Hours of fun!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is an opportunity to get inside the head and the feelings of a Navy Seal. Contrary to what has been aledged, in some of the media, this is not a secret revealing book of any measure. The story is the human side of a hero and some of what he has experienced. In my humble opinion, what is NOT said speaks volumes about the author and all military people that step up and take on the most dangerous missions that require extreme skill and bravery. Not once will you read the author taking personal credit for anything that was accomplished. It was, and always will be with these men, the team that gets credit, if indeed, any is offered.<br /><br />Makes me proud to be an Amercan, knowing there still are fine, dedicated young people willing to step up and protect our freedoms.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|A great game for young and old.  It is fun to race against grandson,he knows it all you know.!  A great thing to take out while waiting; waiting waiting!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I could play this all day. it reminds me of the carnival except I don't waste all my money. I suggest this game.
B0013F1D02|5.0|I loved this movie!  And it's great for the kids too.  Hard to find too many good movies that we can all enjoy.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I just thank that u should try to at least read the bible for up to at least 5 to 10minutes a day. It really canged my life. I'm  a Christian  and have been since I waa 9 weeks old.I got baptised in febuary 2012.I have dedicated  my life to Christ  and u should to!?!.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I love playing this game. Great graphics! Some surprises too! I also liked the three different games.  I would play the one with no bombs for warming up to play the arcade game.  It was also fun to change the backdrop and have different swords each with it's own special effect.  I would recommend to a friend.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Amazing!  I can't believe how spectacular this band is!  They are our new fab four!!!!  Hope they never stop making music, though I think that Marcus, Country, Ted and Ben couldn't if they tried!
B005SWLITC|5.0|Leonard makes mistkes with women but is learning that there IS a double standard. And here is where we meet Amy for the first time and we are shocked that the relationship went well with Sheldon.
B0091REZMW|5.0|great game very enjoyable. the interface is very good. gives you just enough variety to make it enjoyable. keep it up.
B005SBWT4Q|5.0|Any episode where the mothers appear is very funny. Either the mother of Lenard or the mother of Sheldon. Also the \\"girl friend\\" of Sheldon Amy is also very funny.
B002TXZT7K|3.0|The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency makes for good humored easy reading and I will recommend it to anyone who knows life in Botswana or who would like to know, seen through the traditional ladies' humoristic eyes.  One critic I have is that the eight books could easily have been combined into one as the writer repeats himself assuming the reader has not read the previous books in the series, so it does become quite boring eventually.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is so fun but it is addictive I play it nonstop all the time. my family also loves it very much!
B003O86FMW|4.0|Brilliant second book of Three.  I could not put it down from cover to cover.<br />Real good read for all ages
0930289234|3.0|Look i know a lot of people will hate me for this and will think im a bit biased and i am in a way but i think what most poeple like about this book is the writing which is full of great prose about awesome themes like the effects of godhood and what superheroes could do for our world and good character writing but its simple. Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons are able to create a living breathing world that feels well fought out but the story itself is simple. It is mostly about the psychology of the characters and some of the plot itself which admittidley is pretty silly in some parts. Now look i like the writing of the characters even if some are stereotypical but ultimateley this book is ok with many pages of characters talking about morality and human nature which are good but drag on too long. Ultimately for me this book was ok and i do feel it has really good writing but ultimateley it is ok.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As good as the previous two of three books.  Could not wait to read the conclusion but did not want it to end.  Good for all ages
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is sooo fun! its really simple but yet addicting and fun!this is a classic game, just on a mobile device
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I believe book three of the trilogy was the best of the three.  I love reading trilogy's and will always finish them.  The set of books is basically erotic fantasy, nothing more nothing less.
B00992CF6W|5.0|awesome game. its totally worth the price. use the split touch controls and once i got used to them on my Kindle Fire, i wanted to switch all my computer worlds to here instead!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very cool I love playing this at the fair and now I can play without losing all my quarters!!!!!!!  and its free
B008XG1X18|5.0|If you are interested in anything, then you are going to have as much fun as I am having. I recommend Pinterest.
030758836X|5.0|This book caught my attentiion from the first page. It is a who done it with a great twist. If you like psychological thrillers you will love this. Carol
0307951529|4.0|Having been a big fan of Chris for several years now I really enjoyed the 100 dollar start up. I liked it much more then his previous book. I took a lot of value from the many case studies throughout the book.<br /><br />While being an entrepreneur certainly isn't for  everyone, for those of whom it is for this book just might be the kick in the ass they need to drop their excuses and execute.
B008CLI4N4|4.0|I am half way through the 5 disks.  The drama and story are good, but the action is a bit too graphic and gory for my taste.

B008C1O8CA|3.0|*** Update ***<br />I feel compelled to update my review below as I was wrong and might have jumped the gun with my original thoughts - which remain below.<br />Uno is actually quite boring. I've hardly listend to it since the first week and haven't been compelled to. The songs are quite catchy at first but after a while you realise that they have no substance. It's all out there to hear on first listen and there's nothing really here that's built for longevity. Fell For You and Troublemaker are the only tracks that hold any great interest to me<br />I've dropped it from 4 stars to 3.<br /><br />Original review:<br />After the recent disappointment of The Killers Battle Born and to a lesser extent The Darkness' Hot Cakes I was prepared for another let down with Green Day's Uno - if the guys didn't perform to expectations.<br />Would releasing three albums mean there'd be too much filler? Could they really pump out close to 40 quality songs?<br />First impressions when listening through Uno is there there's nothing bad on here. No duds. If on first listen there's nothing to turn me off then on each listen the songs can only get better!! Right? However, is there anything here truly A grade memorable? Time will tell.<br />I don't think I'll ever love Kill The DJ but that seems to be the only slight blemish on what's a very agreeable album.  It sounds like a mesh of Nimrod and Warning to me but with less variation in sounds.<br />I shall now repeat repeat repeat and come back......<br /><br />I'm back after a weekend of heavy listening and all I can say is I'm quite pleased!!  2012 isn't the write-off it was turning out to be!!<br />Highlights for me are:<br />Nuclear Family is a great opener<br />Let Yourself Go - classic GD<br />Fell For You is maybe the highlight for me<br />Troublemaker could be taken from Warning<br />Oh Love - not the most original creation but catchy.<br /><br />The other tracks are all great tunes as well:<br />Stay The Night though is perhaps abit overlong<br />Carpe Diem is like how Jesus of Suburbia would sound if it were from Warning<br />Kill The DJ is catchy - I admit it.<br />Loss Of Control is more classic GD<br />Angel Blue could be a lost Dookie track<br />Sweet 16 is as the title suggests: sweet.<br />As for filler, there's none really. Maybe Rusty James (or is it Gloria?) is the only lesser track. It's nice but not in the class of the other tracks - perhaps it's too familiar sounding.<br /><br />Uno isn't 5 star like American Idiot or 21st Century (maybe too heavy on a verse/chorus format and there's nothing really innovative here) but it's still a quality release. It's an album of singles but not `smash hit' singles and has elements of all previous Green Day albums.<br />I can't wait for the next two albums. One would think that Uno will be the biggest seller of the three (and each subsequent album selling less than the previous) but here's hoping the quality of the next two is even greater.

1612680011|1.0|I read this book at the local library recently, and I honestly do not understand the hype. Others have focused on the fact that this book is more than likely a book of fiction, but the advice in this book is just plain awful.<br /><br />For example, the introduction by the co-author talks about a conversation she had with her son. The son tells her that an education is worthless because most of the people who make the most money aren't making money related to their education. The examples the son gives are Joe Montana and Michael Jordan. Instead of pointing out the obvious (unless you are an elite athlete, this is an unrealistic goal, and even great athletes often never make any money), she says that she was dumb-founded because her son was correct.<br /><br />Continuing with the anti-education theme (which clearly has Freudian overtones considering his father's choice of career), Kiyosaki regularly degrades education. While there is the occasional drop-out who becomes a billionaire, study after study has shown the effects of education related to income.<br /><br />Then, there is his insistence on the wonders of penny stocks. Most penny stocks end up losing money, but he insists that it is basically gambling money. The great investors (i.e., Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch) don't gamble with penny stocks or day-trading, but focus on solid investment principles.<br /><br />Finally, there is the casual indifference or outright hostility to other people. Kiyosaki says that you get rich by serving people, but he talks with glee about making money on foreclosed homes (which was especially distasteful considering that I read this book after the housing bubble popped), how lazy most workers are, and basically seeing others as pawns in a game of making himself rich. I am glad that I didn't actually buy this book to contribute to padding his wealth, and I encourage you to read other books on the subject of finances such as \\"Think and Grow Rich,\\" \\"The Richest Man in Babylon,\\" and books by Suze Orman and David Bach.and books by Suze Orman and David Bach.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Having seen a lot of movies, first in the theaters, and then on video; I ignored The Big Year. Only to be pleasantly surprised by one the most underrated and equally delightful movies I've seen in years. The Big Year is about birding, and if you weren't a fan before you might be after viewing this movie. Fun to watch and it fulfills the basic purpose of a movie, to entertain you for a few hours and leave you with a good feeling. Watch it yourself and see what I mean. Truly a wonderful movie.

B0088WGBC8|5.0|Ryan and Denzel at their best! Action packed thriller with plot twists and turns. Well worth the rental. When is part 2 coming out?!!!
B008NW67IQ|5.0|Mumford and Sons are the greatest quartet of the past decade. Although this album does not match \\"Sigh No More\\", it delivers a multitude of emotions served up alongside a dream to learn to play the banjo. To say that 'Babel' is 'another step in the right direction' for the band would be an insult to the band, because Mumford and Sons is simply, already there.<br /><br />Babel - 9.3<br /><br /> Mumford and co. truly start off with an inspirational, introductory piece that testaments the band's smooth mixture of preachy, dramatic lyrics (I cry Babel! Babel! Look at me now then the walls of my town they come crumbling down.), banjo chord repetition, and vocals that fluctuate in girth. It's a rather predictable song from this band. It is not a song to emotionally uplift you, but regardless, it is a fantastic, aesthetically pleasing ballad.<br /><br />Whispers in the Dark - 8.1<br /><br /> Whispers starts off with an over-abundance of strings which seem to take over the lyrics. A repeated banjo progression with backing guitars and a vague hymn that many listeners may find annoying. The lyrics are rather inconsistent, and rhymes seem forced at times (a very rare thing for a band of this caliber). However, this song is a treat for string lovers, and the band utilizes a comfortable beat throughout. Many various instruments take control at various times, in sync with changing vocals, creating a separation, of sorts, between the harmonies.<br /><br />I Will Wait - 7.7<br /><br /> There are parts of `I Will Wait' that really left me skeptical. Vocals were occasionally flat and rather monotone, and the lyrics will have a very tough time breaking into the emotions of any listener: (So I'll be bold, as well as strong, and use my head alongside my heart.) Eeeep. These lyrics are not equal to the potential this band has previously shown. The emotion here is somewhat dull, and it does not feel genuine in the rare parts it is presented. The final minute of the song, where the horns are busted out, rescue the title and give it a great reason for listening, and add much more emotion to the somber piece.<br /><br />Holland Road - 8.6<br /><br /> Holland Road is a great musical piece. The music has modesty, but serves its far share of intensity when it is needed. It does not overtake the vocals, which are superior to most of the other songs. The song has several moments where small crescendos peek out, but are not fully unleashed. It's a very teasing tactic, but I believe it works in harmony with the lyrics. It's probably the best presentation of the relationship between music and lyrics in the album.<br /><br />Ghosts That We Knew - 8.6<br /><br /> The first slow song on Babel. A somber, consistent banjo melody in the background is the perfect compliment to the masculine, bass tones of the vocals and it is something that should be on your goodnight playlist. `Ghosts' does pick up a bit towards the end, and I feel it is a bit out of place, but I still found it extremely comforting. The lyrics were also outstanding: (But the ghosts that we knew will flicker from you, and we'll live a long life.)<br /><br />Lover of the Light - 9.3<br /><br /> For the first time, I actually felt like the music was completely unheard and original. In most tracks on this album, there are so many musical similarities that it can be difficult to tell them apart. But not \\"Lover of the Light.\\" It was quirky, and fun, and ecstatic, unapologetic, out there, confident. The sounds emerging from this track came from a place of pure joy, in the deepest realms of the heart of a music lover. You will not be able to listen to this emotionless.<br /><br />Lover's Eyes - 8.3<br /><br /> There are often moments in Mumford's songs where the music will tend to show you a glimpse of intensity, only to be taken away, then given back later on in full bloom. And this technique typically works. In `Eyes', I think they may be strutting the line a bit too closely. There was a moment or two inthe song where the mood was just killed. In order to make this work, the immediate somber session needs to be something special in order to effectively build back up to the true crescendo. However, that is one sole fault in an otherwise beautiful piece. There was a great horn and string relationship in this piece.<br /><br />Reminder - 8.0<br /><br /> A simple, brief song with an obvious focus on lyrics. They are complemented by a lovely guitar, but could have used at least one more instrument to carry the lyrics. Great words in here though.<br /><br />Hopeless Wanderer -  9.0<br /><br /> Some brilliant guitar work here. The band truly takes a musical turn that beckons raw, fearless emotion. If people ever feared that Mumford would not flourish if they altered some of their music, this should answer their questions about it. Probably the most surprising song on the album. It's good, scary good.<br /><br />Broken Crown - 8.8<br /><br /> A very desolate piece, kind of heartbreaking. The band uses their intimidating vocals, which were such a success in their previous album. The song sounds very threatening. And any band that can make a song like that work with a banjo progression has gotta be doing something right. This is a very deep piece that you will not experience any joy from, but you will be moved. This is testimonial to the vast skillset that Mumford and Sons has at changing the mood of their music at their very whim.<br /><br />Below My Feet - 8.7<br /><br /> It seems like the band actually pulls out an electrical guitar for the piece. Odd. But it's musically delicious, especially in the final minute. Nothing to get extraordinary ecstatic over though. Great percussion here as well, they pulled out all the stops musically. Same ole steady, slowly rising voice throughout. There is a brief moment of godly delivery at about 3:40 that you need to hear to believe.<br /><br />Not With Haste - 8.6<br /><br />  A great farewell to a fantastic album. Lyrics are admirable. (Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste.) It's almost as if he's speaking directly to the listener, metaphorically awesome. There is a somber tone throughout, but not one of regret. The song seems to bring listener and performer together with unifying lyrics and music.<br /><br />Overall: 8.9<br /><br />`Babel' follows up `Sigh No More' with the same kind of tender musicality and humanity-driven lyrics. Mumford and Sons takes what they do best and they do it more, and more. If you're looking for a different band then the one that brought you `Sigh No More', you'll need to look closely for instances of change, and appreciate them when they come.<br /><br />This album does not top their debut, but it certainly proves that Mumford and Sons are able to own their exclusive musical genre that only they can conquer. If you are a fan, you will be a fan for life.<br /><br />And I certainly hope you are.

I don't think so.  Top that off with weak writing, and I went into kindle speed mode about half way in. (that's flip the pages looking for the few good parts).<br /><br />It's probably an ok read if you have no other choice, but there's lots of better choices,.

0060873175|4.0|Nanigen MicroTechnologies has created a process to shrink machines like similar companies but the firm can reduce and return to normal size living beings.  Company CEO Vin Drake deploys plans for the firm and him to make billions of dollars.  However, Nanigen executive Eric Jansen threatens Drake's plan.  Soon afterward, Jansen vanishes.<br /><br />Jansen's brother Peter comes to Oahu accompanied by six other graduate students.  He investigates what happened to his sibling only to have Drake shrink him and his companions; leaving them to die in the forest.  Their size turns the group into tasty morsels for ravenous gigantic beasts like insects, but this magnificent seven has skills that give them a good chance of surviving.<br /><br />With a nod to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, Micro is an exciting science fiction story.  The fast-paced storyline makes great use of the Hawaiian rainforest setting in which bugs normally ignored become vociferous predators.  Although the team has too great needed expertise, fans will enjoy this entertaining thriller.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0099G3I96|5.0|As a long time No Doubt fan I will most likely love anything they do. But if something is bad, I can admit that too. But this is GOOD! You can feel the older ND swag, mixed in with this new, fresh, mature album. Push and Shove, and Settle Down proves they can still kick our asses. But they don't really need to prove anything. Gwens vocals are mesmerizing in some of the slower songs. Such good stuff. Its really exciting to be able to follow a bands career, and see them evolve. So buy  this album, and enjoy the journey.
B0070XFNDE|4.0|This book would make no sense without reading The Angel's Game and Shadow of the Wind first. I know Zafon would like to think these three are stand-alone novels, but they're really not. I recommend reading the books in this order: The Shadow, The Angel's, The Prisoner. Read that way, it was an extremely enjoyable experience for me. Like other reviewers, I wish this volume was longer. It was great to catch up with Sr. Sempere, Daniel, Bea, Fermin and David Martin again.
B005LAII80|5.0|I never considered myself a fan of Judge Dredd in comic book form, nor did I like or enjoy the Judge Dredd movie from the 90's, but deep down I have always responded at some deep emotional level to the potential that I have always seen in what Judge Dredd can be.<br /><br />I have always yearned for a Judge Dredd which shows not the great and idolized hero of MegaCity One hell bent on protecting it and all creation against some great conspiracy of evil, but instead a simpler Judge Dredd where he is just one of thousands of nameless, faceless Judges who kicks ass, takes names and do their best to protect the innocent.<br /><br />And at its core that is what this movie is, there are no mentions of cloning or how it is Dredd became who he is, no discussions of his family, no talk even of where he goes and what he does at end of shift. That's why this movie is brilliant, yes believe it or not I said brilliant (and in regards to a Judge Dredd movie?) I'm as shocked as you are. This movie's simple story of a single bust gone horribly wrong mixed with elements of \\"Training Day\\", \\"The Rookie\\" and other movies which feature breaking in rookie police officers takes us away from the need to explain things in a grandiose or comic book fashion and instead simply allows us in 90 minutes to ride along with Judge Dredd and Judge Anderson get a quick peek at both the wonders and the grim of the world of MegaCity One.<br /><br />I highly recommend you see it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is just as addictive as the first two. I liked Christian's POV at the end. Made me think of another book; Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus...lol

B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The movie is great if you like action-packed superhero movies.  Good special effects, deccent story, a few too many snarky lines.  Well worth the current reducced price.  However, I pre-ordered the 4-disk Avengers BluRay set in late July with a pre-order price guarantee. Amazon shipped my disk (along with thousands of others) the day before release at my full pre-order price. On the release date Amazon lowered the price by ten dollars (about 33%) and a customer service rep said the price guarantee applies only until the ship date!  They gave me a credit for the difference, but only after I called.  Then a day after it arrived I got an e-mail saying that the price guarantee did apply.  Either the Amazon agent I originally spoke to was wrong or Amazon realized how offended their customers like me were at this treatment.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book show how the constant disregard of people who like to spend time alone to do projects and/or prefer to think before they speak has been a problem with actual consequences. In places where extroversion is celebrated and introverts are criticized for their difficulty to \\"open up\\", life can be hard. This book helps to explain why that is and why the extroverts need to back off, the the introverts sake and their own. If you feel like you are criticized for being quiet or not being enough of a bragger or any thing like that, I would highly recommend reading this book.
B005I548B4|5.0|I really enjoyed reading 'The Best of Me'. It's a lovely story and you can't really go wrong with Nicholas Sparks' books.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|The expectations were really high for this album..<br />A lot of the track leaked ahead of time with poor quality and so it always removes a bit of the surprise, hence some ppl are disappointed.<br /><br />the good:<br />- he stuck to his original style for most songs.. just pure electronic goodness, little singing.<br />- most original pure electro tracks are excellent: Fn pig, channel 42, closer, october.<br /><br />the bad:<br />- the highlight songs are so-so.. veldt is just chill. griefers is annoying. failbait doesnt really belong<br />- missing a big punch (FML), a beauty (I remember) or just legendary (ghost'n stuff)<br />- cmon should have included aural psynapse or ceiphei, then it would have been 5 solid stars<br /><br />It's going to be a great album to work to, and I love it for that.<br />But not one I would force my friends to listen to because it cant be missed..<br />I will just integrate psynapse and ceiphei to complete it :)<br />In any case, it's great to see that the mau5 stays true to himself, not going to dubstep or guetta dance!

B008RV5K5E|4.0|As of late, Animated Batman movies have been verbatim to the comics with only little changes to make things \\"fit\\" this one is no different. Not to be confused with Nolan's live action run. And Nolan's films are inspired by Frank Millers Batman comics. If it ain't broke, don't fix it approache and Millers work on Batman is probably the best run, i enjoyed the voice acting and thought it fit well with a aged batman, but why is Bruce Wayne the only person who seemed to age in the entire world? the lead into part 2 is just making me itch for more, I only gave it four stars because it just didn't feel right to split it up in 2 parts, but doing so probably will make this even greater. Though not finished,  But I'm sure part 2 will be no joke.<br />5 stars when part 2 comes out.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|I don't think i have ever read a book w/ so much emphasis on 1 particular product. I think the author gets paid per mention. I hope apple is paying well. Also the little game between her and Ryan is getting old. Get  a steady boyfriend and be done with it. At least the story line isn't too boring. Definitely not her best effort. The worst of it is its the one i paid the most for. I probably wont be in such arush for the next one.
B0094OLFUW|2.0|Quite disappointing - to take all this time between albums and for this to be the result.  The first album was great and this is a sad second attempt.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|What a waste of $10.  This is nothing more that harlequin gone porn.  The characters are shallow and unbelievable.  And, \\"Oh, crap\\", I almost forgot that the dialogue is also stupid.  I won't be wasting any more money on the next books.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book is very good. Sometimes it gets a little personal, in my opinion. But the rest of the book is kind of sounds like he has a mind of a child, but I like that because it's easy to understand. There are some funny parts which is cool. And I also like the way he thinks about things and all the things he observes about people and the things around him.

B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is fantastic! You build your own category lists, browse through thousands of things other people have posted, and keep the ones you like too. When you discover a new item online (ie: products, recipes, diy, etc.) you can &quot;pin it&quot; to your Pinterest page to share the item that delighted you to the massive Pinterest following. I've found some amazing products on Pinterest that I don't think I would've found on my own. Be careful though- it can swallow up large amounts of time if you let it!!

0307594009|4.0|This was an interesting read - I was simultaneously struck by how \\"normal\\" and mundane Anne's musings often were given her extraordinary living conditions, and by how mature and observant she was. She was more self-aware at 13 than I am at 32! Knowing that things did not end well for Anne added to the poignancy of her writing. This is one of those books that everyone should read, I can't believe I didn't read it earlier.
B009AMAK0E|5.0|Engaging tale about an ancient baseball scout sent to scout a hot prospect highschool hitter who \\"may have an impact on a team for 15 years.\\"<br /><br />Gus (Clint) is sent to check the kid out. The head of scouting (John Goodman) of [[ASIN:B00009AOAX The Babe]] calls upon Gus's daughter as he wonders if Gus is alright.  Gus has gone to the doctor and has eye problems.  His daughter Mickey is a high-power lawyer ready to be a partner, she takes a break to help, which of course endangers her position.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Matthew Lillard of [[ASIN:B00005QW6W Summer Catch]] aspires to be the next General Manager of the Atlanta Braves.  We see the Braves offices and their draft preperation, akin to [[ASIN:B006IMY5ZU Moneyball]].<br /><br />What I thought was engaging was that they actually gave the kid-Bo Gentry-being scouted a story line.  He's a punk.  We see him play and get to see his teammates, akin to [[ASIN:B000068NNT The Rookie [VHS]]].  Also, one of the other scouts is the veteran pitcher from [[ASIN:B001D09OAI Major League]].  There are some baseball quizes and a love story, several story lines.  The dented Mustang is behind many of the scenes.<br /><br />In the end we get to actually see the results of everything that occured and all the loose ends are nicely tied up into a nice package. Clint even cries, not that's 'actin'.

B007U1FEJE|4.0|I was really afraid (and a music expert once said to me) that the \\"Beach Boys 85\\" was most likely the last new song recording album that the Beach Boys would probably ever do. I am certainly glad that the expert was wrong. \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" is a great album.<br />If \\"409\\" is one of your favorite Beach Boys songs this ablum is probably not for you. On the other hand, if you think \\"Pet Sounds\\" is one of the best albums that the beach boys ever produced, you have to listen to this new album. The only song that I really don't like musically would be \\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\" but I love the message that reality TV is not worthy enough to spend time watching, especially in the Summer time, when you can be outside!<br />Add \\"That's Way God Made the Radio\\" to \\"Pet Sounds 40th Anniversary (In Stereo)\\" and you will be rewarded with almost 80 minutes of great music to warm your heart even when it is cold outside.

B007JWC8ZC|5.0|When \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" made its theatrical debut on June 26, 1987, many critics pounced on it. Stanley Kubrick, they asserted, had gone from being a great innovator to a follower. He was now behind the curve instead of out in front of it, as he'd always been, because so many Vietnam movies already had been released -- \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" \\"The Deer Hunter\\" and \\"Platoon\\" among them. If Kubrick wasn't washed up, they seemed to be saying, he certainly was slipping down Has-Been Hill.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with that stance that I would have trouble finding where to begin. But I will say this: Each of these films is its own world, and each is very much a product of its director's style and vision, and each does different things. \\"Apocalypse Now\\" is Francis Ford Coppola's take on the war, and it's the most surreal and deliberately absurd. Michael Cimino's \\"The Deer Hunter\\" benefited from its significant focus on the home front during the war -- while the director did present the trauma suffered by soldiers, he also succeeded in depicting the hurts the war inflicted on loved ones, families, even an entire community. Oliver Stone's \\"Platoon\\" was, oddly, the most \\"realistic\\" of the four films, and in my opinion the least imaginative, though I still think it's a fine film.<br /><br />And then we have Kubrick's \\"Full Metal Jacket.\\" More than any of the other three films, it is a character study. The character in question is Joker, who has joined the Marine Corps, he claims, because he wants to kill. But there is much more to him; he is, in fact, a very sensitive individual and, compared with his peers, an intellectual who quotes Carl Jung and ponders \\"the duality of man.\\"<br /><br />Many commentators have declared the film consists of two acts, but actually, it's a classic three-act structure. Act One is the boot camp sequence. Act Two follows Joker as he deals with his assignment as a military journalist. Act Three begins with the Tet Offensive, and ultimately forces Joker to give up his stance as journalist/observer in favor of soldier/participant.<br /><br />I do agree with people who say the first act of this film is so impressive and overwhelming that the rest of the picture can seem anti-climactic. Much of the reason lies with R. Lee Ermey, whos portrayal of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the most unforgettable performances in cinema history. Hartman's view, apparently, is that boot camp should be as hellish as possible, the better to prepare these would-be Marines from what they'll face in Vietnam. And the irony is he's right; it's just that he takes it to such an extreme that it results in two tragic deaths. Prior to that, though, Hartman unleashes upon his trainees a nonstop stream of profanity, verbal abuse, physical punishment and general humiliation.<br /><br />The result is a sequence that is both funny and horrible. Hartman is a brutal man, but his endless invective is laced with comments that one can't help but be amused by. Ermey was originally hired as a consultant on the film, and told Kubrick the original dialogue should be changed because it was unrealistic. Ermey, with the idea of playing the role of Hartman himself, performed part of the script to show Kubrick how he thought it should be done. Kubrick gave him the role.<br /><br />His favorite target is Leonard Lawrence, whom he calls \\"a disgusting fatbody,\\" among other terms of endearment. Unfortunately, the slow-witted Leonard, or \\"Private Pyle,\\" as Hartman calls him, cracks under the constant pressure.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT! Skip the next paragraph if you haven't seen the film.<br /><br />Leonard shoots Hartman, then himself. The sole witness to the carnage is Joker.<br /><br />The film immediately shifts to Act Two, in Vietnam. Joker has attained the rank of sergeant and is a correspondent for \\"Stars and Stripes.\\" Although he seems to like the job, he questions his superior about the euphemisms that are being used by U.S. forces to describe their actions in Vietnam. \\"Search and destroy,\\" for example, becomes \\"sweep and clear.\\"<br /><br />One of Joker's pals is Rafterman, a combat photographer who is frustrated with simply taking pictures; he wants to see the action, the front lines. Joker, who outranks him, basically tells him that, if he has his way, Rafterman won't get his chance. Rafterman's mother, Joker jokes, would do him physical harm when he returned to the States if he'd let anything happen to her son.<br /><br />Then comes the Tet Offensive, which changes both men's lives. The North Vietnamese attack on what is usually a holiday cease-fire. In the midst of the resulting carnage, Joker's superior orders him to go to Phu Bai to report on the situation. Rafterman asks to go with him; Joker tells his superior he doesn't want Rafterman along. His superior overrules him; Joker and Rafterman head for the combat zone.<br /><br />Act Three concerns their experiences on the battlefield. They meet up with a squad that includes Cowboy, who went through boot camp with Joker. Cowboy is now a sergeant. As the squad moves out on a patrol, accompanied by Joker and Rafterman, the squad leader is killed. Cowboy, now a sergeant, is ordered by headquarters to lead the platoon. In the sequence that follows, a sniper starts picking off members of the squad, one by one -- including Cowboy.<br /><br />The survivors finally find the sniper. And it is there, in the movie's penultimate scene, that Joker must face a moral choice -- or, more accurately, a dilemma, as there is no good choice to be made. Still, he must decide -- and makes a decision that surely will haunt him for years to come.<br /><br />\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" ends with the Marine squad marching through the ravaged war zone, glad to be alive, singing the theme song to \\"The Mickey Mouse Club.\\" It's one last, absurd commentary on the grim absurdity we call \\"war.\\"<br /><br />This is a terrific film. Over the years, it has grown in stature, with critics and audiences alike finding more and more to like. I heartily recommend it.ribe their actions in Vietnam. \\"Search and destroy,\\" for example, becomes \\"sweep and clear.\\"<br /><br />One of Joker's pals is Rafterman, a combat photographer who is frustrated with simply taking pictures; he wants to see the action, the front lines.

B007PS0DTI|4.0|Not a bad film.  The story sets itself up for future movies, but still nowhere near the awesomeness of the first one.
B0013FSXT6|5.0|You have to hand it to Stanley Kubrick: He was consistent. Nearly all his films have polarized audiences and critics alike. And nearly all those films have, over time, grown in stature as audiences and critics alike viewed them multiple times, and found more and more to like. Examples of this: \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" \\"Barry Lyndon,\\" \\"The Shining\\" and so on.<br /><br />Add \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" to that list. Indeed, it may have been the most polarizing of all. In fact, it still is -- look at the ratings bestowed by Amazon customers. You'll find lots of five-star nods, yes, but also lots of one-star ratings. This seems to be a love it or hate it film.<br /><br />When it made its theatrical debut in 1999, I must say I was not completely won over. I thought it was a very good film. I wasn't sure it was among Kubrick's best.<br /><br />Now I am. But \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" has taken longer to grow on me than has any other Stanley Kubrick film. In the 13 years since its release, I've probably viewed it half a dozen to a dozen times. Here are some virtues I've found thanks to my repeated viewings:<br /><br />1. This really is a pretty optimistic film. SPOILER ALERT: Despite everything they go through, Bill and Alice Harford decide to stay together. Of course this was evident the first time I saw it, but in many ways the film was so dark and ominous that the couple's talk in the toy store wasn't enough to redeem it from being downbeat. The more I've watched that scene, though, the more love I see in it, and understanding ... and even a bit of sly humor. Certainly it is interesting that it turns out the last word of the last Kubrick film (SPOILER ALERT) turns out to be the f-bomb.<br /><br />2. It's exquisitely structured. This film is downright elegant in the way it's put together. In the opening scenes, the couple is dressing for a party. Said party follows, and couple attends, with both of them flirting with other people. The next night, fueled by some killer weed, Alice Harford makes a startling confession. Her statement completely unnerves Bill. He then embarks on an odyssey that leads him to some strange places, including a prostitute's apartment and an orgy where the filthy-rich guests are masked. Finally, Bill receives a warning; he was not a welcome guest at the orgy, and he is urged to stop asking questions about it lest harm come to his family. He is then confronted by Victor Ziegler, a wealthy patient of his (Harford is a doctor). Ziegler informs Bill he was a participant at the orgy, and emphasizes again that Bill must stop asking questions and try to forget about what he saw.<br /><br />3. No other film I can think of explores the psychology of sexuality as thoroughly and as effectively as \\"Eyes Wide Shut.\\" Attraction, attachment, jealousy, anger, fear, fulfillment: All these realms are visited. It has taken me all these viewings to appreciate how Kubrick interwove them the way he did.<br /><br />There are many other elements to admire, too. As usual, Kubrick's lighting is just dazzling. The music is aptly disturbing. And Kubrick drew out of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who play the Harfords, two of the best performances each actor ever has given.<br /><br />If you haven't seen \\"Eyes Wide Shut,\\" I recommend it. I would make sure you get the uncensored version, without the black CGI figures that were placed in the original theatrical release to secure its R rating. They're extremely distracting and annoying, and the fact is that the simulated sex they masked wasn't all that explicit, compared with what we've seen since.eed, Alice Harford makes a startling confession.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|Much has been made of author Stephen King's dissatisfaction with Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of his third novel, \\"The Shining.\\" In fact, far TOO much has been made of it. True, the book and movie are significantly different, but one wonders what King was expecting. Kubrick was one of the most independent, individualistic of filmmakers; whatever he did, he put his stamp on it. If King thought Kubrick was going to treat \\"The Shining\\" any more reverently than any of the director's previous source material, he was sadly mistaken.<br /><br />King's main objection to the film is his belief that Jack Nicholson played Jack Torrance, the lead character in both book and movie, as crazy from the beginning, whereas in the novel, the presumably haunted Overlook Hotel causes Torrance to go gradually insane (in both cases, Jack's alcoholism also seems to be a factor). First of all, King is exaggerating. Yes, the movie does suggest Jack is mentally disturbed before he ever arrives at the Overlook. But the film is yet dynamic concerning this element; whatever is \\"wrong\\" with Jack, the Overlook amplifies it drastically. Second, I believe King's opinion was colored by the role Nicholson had played in \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" insisting that the audience would identify Jack Torrance with Randall Patrick McMurphy. The truth is, though, that Nicholson made four other films in the five years separating \\"Shining\\" and \\"Cuckoo's Nest.\\"<br /><br />Apparently, this all bothered King so much that he couldn't resist the opportunity to remake \\"The Shining\\"; it appeared in 1997 as a three-part TV miniseries based on King's own screenplay. I can describe that effort in one word: Forgettable.<br /><br />And Kubrick's \\"The Shining\\" is anything but forgettable. In fact, I think it stands as one of the great horror movies of the 1970s and early 1980s, a very fertile time for the genre.<br /><br />There are images in this film that will haunt me forever. Who can forget Danny, the Torrances' son, riding his Big Wheel down those long, carpeted halls? Or the way the Steadicam followed him? Also memorable: A long, long closeup of nothing more than Nicholson's face, lingering on him as his Jack Torrance begins to come completely unglued. And of course there's the scene in which Jack, trying to get to his wife, Wendy, bashes his way through the bathroom door with an ax. And the two little ghost girls who torment Danny. And the young/old woman in the bathtub. And ...<br /><br />And on and on, really; \\"The Shining\\" has so many iconic moments that it's almost inevitable that those who discuss the film will leave out something important. (I've deliberately left out one of the most infamous visuals in the film; feel free to comment on my review if you can fill in the blank.)<br /><br />I think \\"The Shining\\" is a great film. Perhaps King is just too close to this particular novel to see it objectively; it is one of his most personal books, given that he struggled with his own substance abuse, as does Jack Torrance. Whether \\"The Shining\\" \\"scares\\" you or not depends on personal taste; those who love ultraviolent slasher flicks probably aren't going to be impressed.

0385344333|2.0|The seventeenth Jack Reacher novel by Lee Child is titled A Wanted Man. The setup involves Reacher being in the wrong place at the wrong time. He's in Nebraska and is hitchhiking to Virginia when he gets picked up and becomes diverted into a very odd adventure. The physical Reacher takes a backseat in this novel to the cerebral Reacher, and should have been an opportunity for richer and deeper character development. Instead, the novel proceeds at a snail's pace and even long time Reacher fans are likely to be bored, even with the protagonist himself. Readers who are hooked on the series will probably read this novel anyway. Readers who like thrillers will find some action in this one, but could do better with most other novels from this series and others. I endured to the end, and felt mildly entertained.<br /><br />Rating: Two-star (Mildly Recommended)

B0085776BG|3.0|I wish this had been a better movie. The story needed to be told, and I'm glad it was, but great deeds deserve a great movie, and this just wasn't as memorable as it should have been.  The basic facts about the Tuskegee Airmen are dramatic enough: they broke the color barrier in air combat, and earned the respect of the military and the nation. There just wasn't enough grit or enough depth to the characters portrayed in this film. I'm still glad I watched it, but it won't stay with me the way the great movies do. I have to confess, I did love the planes!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I must admit that I am not much of a book reader so my review may not be as consistent as others but the subject matter of this book certainly had my attention.  I enjoyed the background information about some other missions and the training and application process of becoming a SEAL.  Overall I really enjoyed the book.
B009GEBBNQ|1.0|This is less of a \\"film\\" and more of a \\"long sequence of explosions\\".<br /><br />There is no plot -- it's the same bad guys from Thor, but for some reason, it now requires a half dozen super heroes just to beat them. Except for Thor's evil brother and a giant serpent, all of the enemies are an army of brown Storm Trooper wannabes who die very easily.<br /><br />The other conflict of the movie is that the super heroes do not like each other very much. Captain America finds Iron Man to be arrogant and unprincipled, Hulk hates everyone, Thor wants to be left alone to reason with his brother, and so on. They banter back and forth, but the lines are never funny.<br /><br />Repeatedly you will hear Iron Man say a string of science-y words, then someone will say, \\"In English please!\\", and clearly the audience is expected to laugh every time. And Hulk says something science-y at one point, so Iron Man says, \\"Finally someone who speaks English\\", and I guess I'm supposed to laugh hysterically. Har-dee-har-har.<br /><br />This is one of the most mindless movies I have ever seen. There are only two reasons to watch this movie: (1) you like watching hours of mindless explosions, (2) you like listening to witless banter. Anyone else should save the money.

0345803485|1.0|I'm a writer and when I'm writing I have to be careful of what I read because my brain is some kind of sponge for style and quality,l and I get a \\"garbage in, garbage out\\" effect.  This book was so awful I can't beieve it was published. I stopped reading out of (1)sheer boredom and (2)self-defense. Maybe I should send my manuscripts (the ones everyone else has turned down) to this publisher.  Apparently, they'll publish anything if it has enough graphic, sophomoric, repetitious-to-the-point-of-stupefying sex.  Only problem was the sex scenes were so one-dimensional they weren't even sexy, just laughable. I agree with another reviewer who guessed the book was actually written by a couple of fifteen-year-old girls who probably had never managed to have a date, let alone get laid. The next time some agent or editor tells me, primly,that my writing is just not quite up their exquisite standards, I'm going to point out \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" and ask, \\"is this, perchance, the 'quality' of which you speak?\\" I can't believe such junk is on any bestseller list, and I'm REALLY floored that someone managed to make a trilogy out of it and people are actually buying that.  I give up.  I'm in the wrong business.  I guess I just don't understand how to write the right kind of nonsense.
0007128363|5.0|I love this book. I read it as a child and lost it along the way so when my cousin had a baby I made sure to get this for baby carter. Such a sweet book!
B0086QS7N2|5.0|It's amazing after so many years and so many albums these three guys can still produce great music.  I highly recommend the album.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|my sister recommended this and loved it. but she does not read a lot of paranormal fantasy so maybe she was just easily impressed. i was not. the book was too long filled with a lot of useless information and i believe the next book is even worse. so i will be giving it a pass.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a huge amount of games and I always will love it. I don't understand why people make such a bog deal over games
B000002KE2|5.0|Play at volume !! Track one is one I don't think I heard before buying this CD. Track 2 is great, and i think this<br />is new to me. Track 3 is one I heard in a few forms, Ozzy solo, Black Sabbath tracks on a best off, and a duet with<br />Kelly. I think this is the first time I have heard this exact version. FX, track 4, is part of this CDs experimental tone ( whether it is fueled by the great COKE-Cola company, I don't know).Supernaut is a fiery riff<br />that charges well, and I think I have heard this on a best of collection(although it is hard sometimes to remember<br />some cool riffs, Tony just burns the guitar like wild-fire).Snowblind is one of those super-classic riffs that the<br />band excells at, and Ozzy delivers along with the band: very wild vocal overdubs.Track 7 is one of those loping<br />kind of riffs that BLACK SABBATH seem to develop well, and when you hear the changes it is both a wonder and a<br />surprise, Cornucopia takes us down the path I assume they were going at the time, but since SABBATH were/are never<br />preachy, it is just a kind of fun song that works well with Sabb.For the Guitarist he is, Tony never ceases to<br />amaze, so Laguna sunrise is just a brilliant and evocative piece that he has fashioned in other forms through<br />different albums and he does it oh so well.Bursting from the tonally different Laguna sunrise, St Vitus Dance is a<br />decent riff and rumble from a British band that takes you new places with Ozzy and the guys.The final track is a<br />seemingly apocalyptic precursor to who knows what ( The next  toke ? ); who knows, it works well, meanders around<br />the tones and riffs in such a way that the words dance to that different tune, the different tune that BLACK<br />SABBATH has crafted so superbly in this CD.<br />  The booklet is kind of minor in this version; not much in the way of extras, but check out the mentions<br />of volume 4 in Tony's memoir, Very memorable comments, and the genesis of the dedication to the great COKE-Cola<br />company of LA. A new CD for me, but great overall, considering that some were classics I had heard elsewhere, but<br />together it becomes a great classic BLACK SABBATH album that breaks new ground.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So this trilogy has completely changed my life, for the better.  I absolutely fell in love with these characters.  I am in love with Christian Grey.  Its hard not to be.  My view on sex has changed which is a good thing for a mom who has been married for 10 years and is in menopause and put sex on the back burner along time ago.  But now it has put sex back where it should be.  My husband and I are trying new things.  I learned that I am a total submissive and never realized that was what I was missing in my life.  We got our 6 year old out of our bed and now we can enjoy being with each other again.  I feel younger and awakened.  I have never had a book touch me like this.  And I had never read anything like this before.  I am very glad I decided to get swept away with the rest of the world and let Mr. Grey into my life.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|great account of what went down, with no apparent security risk IMHO. i am very thankful that we are fortunate enough to have warriors of this caliber on our side !!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it! Read it in two days! I can not wait for the movie! Hope it does the book justice!
B009329ZF2|2.0|Battleship was good for what it was, a special effects movie. Acting was fine but nothing to get an award for.
B008N5UX9M|2.0|Steve decides too late that he needs an answer to Maiden member's solo projects and Bruce Dickinson's Skunkworks album, and so he goes from the Maiden \\"prog\\" to 90s alternative. The path to this is simple. Get \\"inspiration\\" from any numerous average bands pretending to be fresh floating around today, get an average typical sounding singer of today to sing the same post grunge meets Disney/r&b melodies. Write the average songs. Then spend many years polishing the average songs to try and play it as if it hasn't been done before. For the finishing touch, sprinkle a few of your trademarks on the top and put your household name on it.<br /><br />On an interesting note, there's only two songs over 6 minutes, truly a feat, not easily accomplished, for Mr. Harris! The final song The Lesson is a well written song.<br /><br />It's nice to see Harris do things out of the normal Maiden mold, but apparently he has no good ideas either inside or outside of Maiden. Given that reality, maybe the next bright step might be to write a biography.
B0091XRL86|3.0|Cute with some adult innuendo.  Love the stop action technique. Charactors were creative. Story line was different. Weren't distracted by whose voice was each charactor.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|My only issue is it keeps freezing up on me! Fun none the less, it's like tetris with numbers! Definitely recommend!

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|For those who have tried and failed to lose weight, this is the book for you.  Based on over 200 years of reseach findings, it deals with the current myths about fats and explains exactly how to easily, safely and healthly lose weight.  I tried it and it has worked for me and it will be the basis of my eating plan for the rest of my life.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game.  quick easy play style.  and lots of levels. I like a game where I can solve a puzzle and not spend an hour.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|The first thing worth noting is that John Scalzi is not just a proficient author, he's a *fun* one. Every time I pick up something of his, I am reminded of how easily his prose flows, how real the world is, and how many pages I just tore through in only a few minutes. Redshirts is no exception.<br /><br />Without getting into spoiler territory, the best thing that can be said is that this needs to be read. Now. Again. Again. And Again. Rinse, repeat. Every time a layer of the onion is pulled back, it's just as great underneath. And the three codas were unexpected and delightful.<br /><br />Scalzi taps into something awesome when he writes. If you actively enjoy reading, then you will enjoy this. Fact.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|I am obsessed with Hello Kitty-so I definitely had to get this app. Especially since it was free! This game can be very addicting and I wanted to keep playing to get money for upgrades. Of course its disappointing that you have to have an insane amount of points to buy the better know characters like HK or My Melody or Keroppi.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Works great on my Toshiba Thrive.  Fun and addicting.  Can't wait until they release new levels.  As fun as Angry Birds.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I would not have read this book if Book 2 had not improved with plot by end of the book.  This book<br />kept my interest and I was satisfied with the ending.
B006HTUZ1C|5.0|fun and addictive and a nice change and break from all the bubble games I play! I don't have any gripes right now, other than I haven't beat it yet :) but I will.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Would love to have watched this film but it just says wrong region and won't play will have to return it
B0042RJWTC|5.0|loved the people that played each character, even learned some about the history of henry viii.  Anyway a<br />great movie, hated it when it was over
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|great easy to use and is easy to print whatever you choose.  Always use it to print puzzles and check statements.
B000002IAS|2.0|It seems to me that not only the sound man was high on something, but also the whole band.<br /><br />The sound quality was awful, but also the musicianship was lacking......speeding up and slowing down all over the place.<br /><br />I believe that these musicians and singers could do a lot better.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is wonderful for my Kindle Fire.  The ease with which I can post to my Pinterest page is great.  I just have to share to the Pinterest app and away it goes to my boards.
B0087HT36U|5.0|entertaining. physics are a bit baffling at times. it is a little sluggish at times on my stratosphere, but playable.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I absolutley love this app because it is very useful for my math homework at first I didn't think it would work but I freaking love this app try it out
B0070TDERU|5.0|I LOVE THIS show, is PERFECT , I would watch it Over and Over , rich details, fantastic actors, everything is PERFECT<br />I highly recommend :)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 10 year old son absolutely loves this game! He has played it so much that his 8 year old sister asked for it on her Kindle! This is a hit at our house!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me on the edge. I totally thought I knew what was going on and then something else would happen. Great read
B008XG1X18|5.0|it makes me laugh, cry and totally be inspired. I love all the diys plus beauty tips. what more could a girl want..
B002MQYOFW|4.0|justifies all the reviews and is a good read. i would guess that you have to be in a certain frame of mind to appreciate the terms and time frame... but i liked the book.
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun little game that can while away some time.  good physics.  a lot like angry birds. recommend it to anyone looking for a game time play here and there just to waste time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Well designed calculator app.  I really like how this calculator app utilizes the entire screen.  This app is a must have.
B000LB7G00|5.0|This is an absolute must have for any CAD or CAM user. Though the two programmable buttons are in awkward spots ( try using them and you will see), the pan zoom rotate is flawless. I had no trouble with the stock settings out of the box. I have now sped everything up. It installed easily on Win7 with no need for driver or firmware updates that I have read are sometimes required. Using one at work, I kept reaching for it at home, so I have one on my desk now.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this game is awesome but no body has it yet please get it it is very fun. please get it so I can play nonlinear with someone!!!
B0090EKRKU|3.0|My 8th grader really wanted to see this movie since it was one of his favorite Dr. Suess books as a toddler. We actually watched it as a family (including my 17 year old son) and enjoyed it. The animation was well done, and it had just that right amount of whimsy that one expects from a Dr. Suess production-- nicely done. It is appropriate for much younger kids as well-- I recommend it.
B004OC07GM|4.0|The book was very though provoking. There were great examples from a wide variety of industries about the differences between sustaining innovation and disruptive innovation. I did find that he used some of the examples too often.
B0006Z2KX4|2.0|My first review of this movie was extremely negative. I saw the movie once more, and actually enjoyed it this time. So I'm updating my review.<br /><br />What put me off from this movie the first time, was that the protagonist seemed to be a manipulative and selfish stalker. It's not until later in the movie, when you meet Susan's mother and family, that you realize why Susan has grown up this way. Even so, you have to really work to suspend your disbelief, to like the character, and think it's a good thing for Carry Grant's protagonist to have ended up with her.<br /><br />Good things about this movie: the leopard's scenes are all very funny. Film noir fans should love the pop culture references and 1930s fashion. And of course, it's probably a must-see for fans of Carry Grant or Katherine Hepburn, who both give enthusiastic performances in this movie.<br /><br />Still not a great movie. But not as bad as I thought it was the first time I saw it.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I thought that this was a great season! Very suspenseful and I love how their are babies in the story now! I didn't like that there were so few episodes, but I can understand why!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Written in a flashback style, the plot begins with an enigma, then takes us back to the childhood of the main character.  Even as a boy, his life is frought with danger and intrigue.  The reader develops a bond with him, as he grows in understanding of the secrets that surround his life and his beliefs.  Excellent reading!
B009CPRYG2|5.0|Don't let the naysayers get you down. For someone who marveled at the Frank Miller story upon its release almost 25 years ago, this is a tough and loving recreation meant to appeal to a a larger audience of adults and mature kids alike.  From the opening sequence on, WB appears to have put a lot of care into this project.  Start with this adaptation and then revel in the graphic novel. You will not be disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is addictive actually my son and I play and remember when the babies are supposed to hatch and hurry to get back on. its a great game.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I enjoy reading fiction involving the US Navy Seals and other military personnel - but this book took me way beyond the norm because it was filled with actual facts and alot of detail (I'm a detail junky). I thought the author did a great job of filling us in on, not only that moment in history that we'll never forget, but the life of these military heroes over the past decade. It made me appreciate that much more the dedicated service of our military personnel. THANK YOU!!  I think every American should read this book.
B0015AARJI|3.0|This shipped out from Supplier very fast and I received it on time. The controller is in original packaging and is brand new. My only disappointment is that it doesn't come with a USB cable. I should have double checked the product details as I now have to place a second order for the cable before I can use this controller.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Best show ever next to walking dead and breaking bad, but this is the best season on the show yet
B007TMON8M|5.0|The different variety of games was very interesting but you really have to come up with unusual and creative solutions to the design problems. Factoring in weight and speed just adds to the variables and makes it a real challenge. I  love this game!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Amazing! I am writing several books so this will help me! A WHOLE LOT! Get this get this!!!!!! Ignore bad reviews listen to me!!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Love this new album! Has the perfect mix of dark and light songs. When she came out with Before he Cheats, every new album is like a new chapter. You'll just fall in love with the songs as they are played.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I learned what i needed... review nessacary? I guess not. But. I could read the whole thing and called A freaking nerd!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|There is a small learning curve, but I love that this app gently but firmly wakes me up to my chosen playlist.  You can set up alarms for a variety of needs, too. So far, I have been appreciating this app - even if I wish I could just sleep in everyday. :)<br /><br />Ps I use this on the kindle.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app and its not to easy, it keeps you on your toes and  thinking! Very quick and easy to download too. I play it at work during downtime when its slow...the kindle along with apps like this comes in handy so much... Love it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am a former security group member and enjoyed the book<br />There were very truthful statements, which the white house<br />will not like, but no big secerts. Was interesting to hear<br />the truth about the mission.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I have been a fan of Mitch Albom  ever since i read The five people you meet in heaven . I have read all of his books. i love how he makes you see life in a different way. i  always feel more grateful  for the life i have and the people i share this life with after reading his books.  The timekeeper makes me thankful  for the time i have  been given with the people i love and cherish  the time i spent with the ones i have lost .
B000ZMCVRI|4.0|I bought the Legends tape 25 years ago and listened to the tape for years!!<br />I finally downloaded this version and there are some subtle differences<br />like a live version of one of the songs and an additional song, but I still love<br />the tape better. Maybe I'm just nostalgic of my teen years.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I loved this movie!!!! It shows who created us.I'm not going to pick this movie apart about the holes. But, they should have left the cuts(Edits)in!! Hopefully, they'll put out a \\"Directors Cut\\" version!! Being a musician, the most glaring hole was the music. I hear music from Alien and Alien:Resurrection. I thought some of the music was good, but I think the soundtrack could have been better! The movie overall was quite enjoyable!!
B007WV05GY|5.0|This movie is not for the faint of heart. It keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Acting and script are excellent though.
B008XG1X18|5.0|works great on my kindle fire and my samsung galaxy S2. All features work just like on the desktop version. Just wish there was a way to install a &quot;pin it&quot; button on my kindle so I could pin things I find when I'm not in the app.
B0087HT36U|3.0|Worth a free download for a few hours Entertainment, but not captivating enough to purchase additional content.  Zoom-in feature is useful and multiple weapon types interesting.  Good for free.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|KJV Bible dramatized is great..love it any time day or night!!  Great for walking or in the car!! Praise God fir making it available and so easy!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm addcited! I am so in love with this app! I am planning everything on here! Also has tons of helpful cleaning tips, I am so addicted:)
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Kept me up at night because I couldn't stop watching.  This season was even better than the first.  Can't wait to watch season 3!!!!
B002VWNIAY|1.0|****(see 2nd paragraph)***Believe me, this has NOTHING to do with the actual movie. Casablanca is by far one of my favorite movies and I love it more the more I watch it. However, I just purchased it (for the second time in about a week) from FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT LLC, fulfilled by Amamzon. Both times I received it, there was a terrible gash on the back of the case that went all the way into the hard plastic of the case, a problem that had been \\"coincidentally\\" covered by extra stickers on the wrapping. The first time I got the movie, I was appalled and, while I only paid $7.something for it, I wasn't going to accept a hideous case. I sent it back and gave them the benefit of the doubt and ordered it again for relatively the same price...and ultimately the same result. I just received the case about an hour ago and I can tell you that I am FURIOUS with this company. My assumption is that someone took a knife to the back of the case and cut it all to hell by accident and therefore resolved to cover up their mistake. Well I'm not going to pay for this atrocity. I am sending it back ASAP and getting my money back. I am NEVER ordering from this company again. I'll take my chances buying Casablanca elsewhere, even if that does mean I have to pay more money. For such an amazing movie, it deserves to be encased in a practically perfect case. I'll reserve judgement on other companies on Amazon selling this movie. As for those who don't care about the case of a movie, feel free to order from FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT LLC, just be prepared for a mangled case. I honestly hate to write a review so terrible in relation to this movie. But I paid good money expecting a pristine, undamaged case and I received a pathetically covered up gash instead. Twice. Take my advice please, don't waste your money on this company, it may be cheap, but believe me, it looks cheaper.<br />****UPDATE!*** I decided to give it one more try considering it was from a different company and it was comingby a different shipper. Same exact damage! What fresh hell is this? Absolutely dumbfounded. In fact, the damage is WORSE from this one! I got this one from what I believe is PONOS and fulfilled through Amazon. I now have reason to believe that the common link is Amazon, and therefore, I believe all cases fulfilled through Amazon are damaged, if I'm wrong I'm wrong, but considering this is the 3rd time this has happened, I feel it is only fair to update my review and now go after Goliath itself! DO NOT BUY THIS FROM AMAZON WHATSOEVER. I don't care if it's from a different selling company, amazon fulfills it. Save your money and go out to your local Walmart or Target, chances are they'll have it in the 5 dollar bin so it's a better buy elsewhere. Shame on you, Amazon!
B001HBYHFA|1.0|I was unable to watch this DVD until a few weeks after receiving it.  I had seen the movie earlier this year and had wanted to share it with a friend.  No more than 15 minutes into it when the DVD started skipping and pausing on it's own.  Unfortunately I no longer had the return information.
1476712042|5.0|So before I start gushing about this title I want to remind everyone that while some sites do refer to this title as a young adult novel, McGuire clearly states that it's a contemporary romance for audiences 17+ years and older.  There's something language and adult content throughout the book that places it outside of the young adult genre.<br /><br />Now that it's clear that this title is not young adult, I can start gushing about this book and the writing McGuire delivers in these pages.  I know you guys have come across books in the past that just instantly draw you in and stand out from the rest of the books on your shelves.  That's what this book was for me, far and away!  McGuire's writing flows naturally throughout the pages and her dialogue will have all her readers feeling like they're hearing the words float off the page, and not just reading the text in front of them.<br /><br />Her characters are fabulous!  Truly people that I wish weren't fictitious and we could all call our friends.  Travis and Abby are sensational but the secondary characters were on equal footing and held their own throughout the book.  I'll admit that while there was plenty going on throughout these pages, it wasn't nearly enough.  When I found out that McGuire has another title coming out in April 2013 that she's called a companion to this title I was over the moon excited!  While this title is primarily from Abby's point of view, Walking Disaster (Beautiful, #2) will be the same storyline but from Travis' point of view and I cannot wait to see how that turns out.  I love the idea of seeing how things panned out from his eyes and getting a more encompassing picture of what really took place for these amazing characters.<br /><br />If you had any doubts about this title or author (not sure why you would) you can rest assured that she is the real deal!  It's a fresh story, a wonderful read and it's a title that I am sure I will read over and over again.  Even still I'm not sure I'llever get enough of this story or these characters!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Very interesting keeps me turning the pages to see what happens next ,I have about 30 pages left ,can only wait to start book three.
0385737955|3.0|I had a lot of fun with this one to be honest.  I'm extremely late to the game with this series, but I finally decided that the book had been sitting on my shelf for long enough.  I've had friends compare this series to those like a lot of other great dystopian series out in the stores, so I was trying my best to go into this one without thinking too much about that, so that I didn't end up having any unfair expectations, and I think it worked out.<br /><br />Dashner's writing was refreshing, easy to keep up with, and had me feeling like I was right there in the action alongside the characters themselves.  I didn't always feel like only an observer, but a part of the story unfolding in front of me.  A lot of times I walk away from a series opener just dying to get my hands on the next book, knowing that if I don't find out what happens next for the characters it'll drive me crazy.  I won't say that I ran right out to the store to get my hands on the second installment, but I'm definitely intrigued to see what happens next for this interesting group.<br /><br />Now that a lot of the pieces to the puzzle have been answered, I can't help but wonder what other mysteries Dashner has in store for his readers in the next two books.  I'm determined to not let too much time pass by before I dive into the next installment, and I'm crossing my fingers that there aren't too many impossible obstacles laying ahead.  These characters have been through a lot already if you ask me.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Beetlejuice is one of those great classic movies from the 80s. It has all the ingredients of a good comedy and Tim Burton to boot. I personally couldn't recommend it more to anyone, especially Tim Burton Fans who for some reason haven't seen this.
0307887448|5.0|I'm saying it right off the bat....I loved, loved, loved this one!  I honestly didn't want this read to end.  I found myself really wishing that it was a series opener instead of a stand alone title because I would love nothing more than for the story to lead somewhere else so that I wouldn't have to say goodbye to these great characters, this wonderful world, and all the action and excitement Cline brought to the table with this title.<br /><br />I cannot thank the lovely people at Random House NY for introducing me and sending me a copy of this wonderful book.  Cline's writing was refreshing, easy to relate to, and the type that kept you wanting nothing more than to keep reading even whether during an intense action scene, a romantic flirtation, or just a casual conversation between characters.  As someone who has enjoyed video games but never got crazy into them, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about this title, but I shouldn't have worried.  Cline will have you engrossed in the story after the very first chapter and no one will be able to resist the storyline he's laid out for his readers.<br /><br />I found myself wishing this was really happening, finally appreciating some of the technology that surrounds us, wondering what it would be like to be able to play out a role in a movie, pick apart a mystery so large that the contest itself could last for years without anyone coming close....the anticipation alone was addicting.<br /><br />I unfortunately had never heard about this before it was sent to me, but I can tell you that now that I have, I'll be recommending it to everyone I know, making to sure to gift it to my big reader friends, and hoping with crossed fingers that Cline brings another title to the table in the future that lives up to this amazing book!
B001HNE3NO|5.0|Really good story.  The book took me in a direction that I did not expect to go, but I could not put it down.<br />I would encourage anyone to read it.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary is beyond the others it was very helpful. I would recommend this dictionary to other kindle fire owners.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I've been patiently (NOT) waiting for this album to drop for weeks!  I pre-ordered and so was able to download 'I Will Wait' early on and absolutely loved it....but, wanted MORE!  The wait was worth it!<br /><br />The first song (and album namesake) 'Babel' just starts the whole experience with a bang.  Every song is good....most are great!  I was nervous about 'The Boxer', but it was a decent cover.  Not the Best. Cover. In. The. World., but a good, honest cover.  If I had never heard the original, I would probably adore it. But, you know....<br /><br />Anyway....just buy the album.  You won't be sorry.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|the book was a great purchase, a classic....I never got to read as a child and now i get to.

B001P9EQH8|3.0|This little guy does a little but not as much as I needed.  I wanted something to boost some speakers in my motorcycle helmet, so that I could hear the music above the wind noise.  My phone + this thing was not enough to make the music loud enough to get through my earplugs.  Guess you get what you pay for.  % increase of volume is probably something like 25% to 50%.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Once I started, I couldn't put it down!  Four stars because some of the mushiness was just too much for me, and the theme of the book just seems too Harlequin romance-y.  Nonetheless it is a very good read!
B004FK8RKG|2.0|not great quality sound.  quiet.  even got a booster, and still not loud enough to cut through my earplugs.  also, once you get them loud (with an external amp), they distort.  only good for quiet volumes
B0050DZN4K|4.0|Update: Feedly has updated the app and I can finally login. Beautiful and works great (despite a few, forgivable glitches here and there). // I love Feedly and was looking forward to using it on my new Kindle Fire HD -- but when I try to login to my account, it just hangs up and won't give me a place to enter my credentials. Hope Feedly fixes this soon, because it's a really awesome reader otherwise.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Exciting introduction for many to the world of a real Navy SEAL. Personal insight into his struggles and trials to become one of America's best. This book proves that there are only a few people who have what it takes and why they choose to become an elite fighting forces member. I'm in chapter 5 and really am glad that I bought this book. The author is a very likeable guy with a real \\"down to earth\\" personality.

I am using the &quot;free&quot; version so I don't have any issues about cost.  However,  there seems to be no way to get the needed &quot;diamonds&quot; except to buy them with cash.  I would have thought there would be a way to earn them.  I guess that is how they make money from the free edition.  Well it was fun while it lasted.  Obviously I will not buy diamonds.
0525952926|5.0|I read Giants and waited for two years to read the sequel. It came to me a little early since I placed an order way ahead of time.

I now have a different outlook on a lot of things.<br /><br />I can't wait for the last one to get here. Rest up a little Ken...then start writing!

B008I3R2VG|3.0|I had a hard time deciding what I felt about this newest cd from The Killers. They are one my top five favorite bands of all time. After hearing the single \\"Runaways\\" I was very excited to see what the rest of the album had in store for us fans. I always give a full album a few listens to grow on me before I decide what I like and don't like. After listening to it all day Friday, taking the weekend off from it, then listening to all of The Killers albums today in order, I think the problem that I am having with it is the lyrics. The music is fine and very much The Killers sound from Hot Fuss to Day and Age. But I'm finding that I not huge fan of a lot of the lyrics for the songs. There does not seem to be a huge connection between some of the lyrics in one song or through out as a concept. I like Brandon Flowers and liked his solo album Flamingo. I think his lyrics have actually been great up until this point. But there just seems to be a real disconnect and I'm unsure of what is going on with the album. Now that being said I like more songs on this cd than I dislike and would suggest buying it if you are a Killers fan but be warned it's not The Killers you use to, at least lyrically in my opinion. It does take a few listens and a open mind to get into it. Not the greatest from them but I don't feel it's the worst I've heard, like some people on here have suggested.

B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The Pilgrimmage of Harold Fry is a well-written tale of self-discovery and atonement.  The protagonist sets out to mail a letter to an old friend and former colleague, and decides to walk the length of Emgland to see the friend instead.  Many experiences ensue...mostly positive, some frustrating and implausible.  Despite numerous odds, Harold remains steadfast in his quest.  There are several plot twists, some of which I had guessed, others were a total surprise.  This fast read will have you thinking about the relationships in your own life and what is important to you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The purchase was fine. I had it delivered to the wrong devise and once I figured it out the next day there were no problems getting it delivered to the device. The book it self I find it hard to get into. I usually finish a great book in 3 days and an ok book in 5. I have been reading 50 shades of grey for 2 weeks and am only 75% done. I love Zane and Eric Jerome Dickey who both write erotic novels so I dont know what the problem is.

B004SBS8LA|2.0|Angry Birds Rio lacks the Pigs and the elaborate structures of the other versions.  The episodes are pretty much the same, and the basic premise (knock over stacked boxes to free birds from cages) is simplistic and boring.  Compared to the original Angry Birds and Angry Birds Seasons, Rio feels like a watered-down Disney cartoon.

B000FC11A6|5.0|I  first read this book in 1999 and it is the first book by Neal Stephenson that I had finished. To this date I have read neither Snow Crash or The Diamond Age (I will make it through both, someday...). I brought it with me to a tech conference during those heady days before the internet bubble burst (and darker things than that happened soon after that). I consumed it within two days. When the paperback came out and promised a sequel...of sorts, I bought them and consumed them as well. This read through was the eBook version (the second eBook copy I have bought, long story as too why!).<br /><br />Cryptonomicon runs two parallel stories, across time. One main thread follows a number of people on the road up to and the journeys during World War II. Historical figures such as Alan Turing mix in with fictional characters as they move from Pearl Harbor to England to Sweden and Finland to the Philippines and more. The second story follows a group, some of which are descended from members of the first group, as they build a technology start-up and jump from the United States to Japan to the Philippines. Real history and made-up history, nifty technology, buried treasure, kinky sex, true love, codes and computers and more.<br /><br />This was my third run through the book, the first time since around 2000. Not only did it stand up well (even though the \\"present day\\" sections now feel more quaintly historical than the sections of the book set during WWII), but it managed to surprise me (again) and keep me captivated even when Stephenson has two character's expound for several paragraphs. The story never felt like it slowed, even then.<br /><br />Still wondering about Enoch Root though. The Roman Catholic version of the Wandering Jew? Somebody who plays too much with lightning? Twins across generations instead of in one generation or what?<br /><br />Good stuff. I have no plans to re-tackle The Baroque Cycle, in the near future (I am reading Reamde for the second time this year!), but this was a good warm-up.year!), but this was a good warm-up.

1846556007|5.0|I first fell a little in love with Harry Hole with the first Nesbo book I read, The Snowman. Ever since then, I've been devouring all his books. This one, The Bat, was not available in the US, so I had it shipped to me from the UK. I'm so glad I did! This story takes place Down Under, where a Norwegian woman on visa in Australia has been murdered. Harry is sent there to \\"observe\\", which is made clear to him by the Sydney police chief. This, of course, Harry takes to mean get right down in it. His Aboriginal \\"partner\\", Andrew, shows him around town and brings him to all the particular places involved in the investigation. Something is not quite right, Harry discovers. At the bar where the murdered girl worked, he meets a Swedish woman and immediately clicks. After interviewing her, he can't help but turn himself around, go right back in and ask her to dinner! Loved the tender scenes between these two. And, Harry reveals things about his \\"first love\\" as well. Bodies turn up and Harry turns on the heat, as well. His mind works far faster than any of the other investigators and he is soon laying a trap. But, will the trap backfire on Harry and his new love?
B004J4WKTW|5.0|...is that she doesn't have anything else written yet.<br /><br />This is an amazing work.  The characters are incredible.  The setting is exceptionally unique.  A very rich and vivid tapestry.  The Night Circus is a very powerful story.  Great ending.
B00973CGXK|2.0|I'll start by saying that The Killers are one of my favorite modern rock bands (~1995 to present). And it's very difficult for a band to put out four solid albums in a row. [[ASIN:B0002858YS Hot Fuss]] might be the best overall album of the past twenty years and [[ASIN:B000GY729M Sam's Town]] is not far behind. I even enjoy [[ASIN:B001FWRZ46 Day & Age]], which many fans (both casual and dedicated) generally found disappointing. Those albums are high standards to meet, but even with diminished expectations, Battle Born falls short and is, without a doubt, the weakest of their four studio albums.<br /><br />Perhaps most disappointing, I've listened to the album 5+ times now and have yet to find a signature song. This is the reason I gave the album 2 stars. There's no Mr. Brightside or When You Were Young (two of the best modern rock songs) or Read My Mind or All These Things That I've Done. Again, those are high standards but that's what we've come to expect from The Killers. From Here on Out and maybe Runaways probably come the closest to being memorable, but as another reviewer mentioned, the songs ultimately fall short and the listener is left wanting more. In any event, the \\"best\\" song on this album isn't even as good as a song like Human, which I consider a third tier Killers song. Worth noting is that the album has a strange 80s vibe to it, almost like it's an attempt at a parody (see for example Here With Me).<br /><br />In summary, Battle Born is forgettable and not worth picking up unless you have to own every Killers Album. I will, however, give the band a mulligan on this one and eagerly await their next attempt.

B0040ZR022|3.0|When he began recording what would turn out to be his first solo LP (except for harmonizing vocals by wife Linda) sometime towards the end of 1969 and into early 1970, some of it at home using a Studer 4-track tape recorder which he then brought to Morgan Studios and later Abbey Road Studios for the rest, The Beatles were already starting to go their separate ways.<br /><br />Lennon had had two singles released in 1969 as by The Plastic Ono Band, and would have another out ahead of McCartney's album - Instant Karma as by John Ono Lennon - while Harrison's first solo single, My Sweet Lord, would be out later in the year followed by the album All Things Must Pass and, perhaps the height of gall considering what was about to transpire, Ringo's own first solo LP, Sentimental Journey, would precede Paul's by coming out in March.<br /><br />Because, with a new Beatles LP (Let It Be) also being finalized in March 1970 by Phil Spector, the other three were concerned that a simultaneous release with Paul's might hurt sales, so they agreed that the more affable Ringo should be the one to pay the sometimes volatile Paul a visit to  try and get him to stall the release date. As McCartney described the scene later the message let it be known that his agreement to stall would be \\"for the good of the group ... and all of this sort of shit ...\\" (it was the old) \\"party line ... they just made him come round so I did something I'd never done before or since ... I told him to get out ... I had to do something like that in order to assert myself because I was just sinking ... I was getting pummeled about the head, in my mind anyway.\\"<br /><br />Both sides had their concerns swept aside when McCartney surged to # 1 on Billboard's Top 200 album charts shortly after its April 1970 release (Apple 3363), despite being quickly savaged by critics for its \\"sheer banality\\" what with half-completed tracks and, as one put it, it's \\"homespun approach.\\" The only track to receive a positive welcome, in fact, was Maybe I'm Amazed, a love song written about wife Linda, which he would re-record live seven years later for the album Wings Over America and then turn into a Top 10 Billboard single for Capitol. But there would be no hit singles flowing - or even released as such  - from this album. But hey, this was McCartney and so the fans weren't as discriminating as they were with Ringo's album which had to settle for a # 22, despite having arguably better contents.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in May, Let It Be also soared to # 1 by which time his split from the group had become public knowledge through the unique measure of an enclosed Q&A sheet dated April 10 sent with advance copies of McCartney in which he gave answers to every anticipated question, including \\"I don't know\\" to the query about whether or not this was temporary or a permanent departure.<br /><br />The tracks, all written by McCartney, are:<br />Side 1<br />1.

0307887448|5.0|In the dystopian future of 2044, the world is going down the crapper and many people spend most of their free time playing OASIS, an online virtual reality game, sifting through every minute detail of the creator's life, for whomever unravels a series of riddles James Halliday left behind inherits it all. Will teenager Wade Watts be the one?<br /><br />As I've said in the past, every once in a while a reader will unearth a book that feels as if it was written especially for them. For me, Ready Player One is one of those books.<br /><br />I wasn't completely sold at first. OASIS reminded me of The Metaverse from Snow Crash and Wade wasn't all that interesting to me. Then he referenced The Last Starfighter and I suddenly became more interested. By the time the Tomb of Horrors was mentioned, I was completely hooked.<br /><br />The plot's structure isn't that revolutionary. It's pretty much your standard hero's journey. As the story unfolded, the characters are what made the book unputdownable. The setting, a dystopia where there's a Global Energy Crisis going on and people live in skyscraper-trailer parks called stacks is both imaginative and horribly plausible.<br /><br />I hate to admit it but I was feeling some kinship with Wade as the book progressed. Is spending most of your free time in OASIS really that much different than reading for hours on end? Also, the book explores the nature of people and their online avatars. The revelation of Aech's true identity illustrates the difference between perception and reality quite nicely, just like the time when I met Kemper and discovered he wasn't a gun-toting chimp in a suit. Apparently, he left his guns at home that day. Or the time when I met Stephen and discovered he WAS a book-reviewing robot.<br /><br />A large part of the appeal of Ready Player One is the astounding amount of pop culture references. While most of them are from the 1980's, a few are not. The Matrix and Monty Python and the Holy Grail, for example. I suspect younger readers won't get as many of the reference and not enjoy the books as much. However, as a child of the 80's and a dyed in the wool geek, I enjoyed the book very very much.<br /><br />As I said earlier, the plot isn't revolutionary but it's still an enjoyable read. A single man-tear threatened to escape my eye during the epilogue but I fought it back. Five easy stars.suspect younger readers won't get as many of the reference and not enjoy the books as much.

B007KOYEOC|5.0|There seems to be only one reason why we girls are reading this book. In the words of of Bryce Courtenay, Mummy Porn. Whilst we all agree it's not the best written literature, we all love a good love story and I am no different. If there are some interesting themes, what the heck, I will admit to enjoying it, the book that is. Blimey, I like the Twilight series. Sorry, I probably shouldn't have put that in. Easy reading a little repetative but I couldn't put the books down, I read all 3. Thumbs up! Hmmm poor choice of words.
B005LAIH54|2.0|Can't believe this movie cost 150 million dollars.The only good thing was the mythological creatures.Too much talking and not enough action.Not even Fiennes and Neeson can save this movie.There was some fighting scenes with weapons and they were badly edited with too many quick,close up cuts.<br /><br />Save your money and if you're curious to watch it.Wait for the dvd.Only good performances were from Toby Kebell which was the comic relief.
B007MB5OCE|2.0|Been there, done that. This borrows tone and trajectory heavily (HEAVILY)from Forrest Gump, but doesn't do it as well. While this is decent escapist literature, it doesn't rise to the level of good science fiction (pulp, that is) or the Tarzan series. It is a reckless vomitus of the author's comedic imagination that fails on several levels.<br /><br />CHARACTERIZATION; The characters are fleshed out, but you aren't given a reason to like them, much less identify with them and root for them.  This is true of ALL the characters. Sympathy is created equally for all and is therefore, universally inadequate. In short, these characters have no HUMANITY. They are all ridiculous charicatures of situations people envision themselves or others in at extreme moments. Forrest Gump, on the other hand, had his Jenny with her debilitating eccentricities that he continually suffered through, and his ultimate humility in the face of a parade of world figures. We like Forrest Gump. We admire him.<br /><br />RATIONALE; Both Forrest Gump and The 100 Year Old Man face us with the need to suspend disbelief. Forrest Gump presents a scenario where a boy with a previous deformity overcomes it to the extreme and builds the rest of his life on the strength of physical prowess. 100YOM takes a child and makes him an explosives expert at 10, later sequeing into an intuitive understanding of nuclear physics and atomic explosions. Again, looks like the Swede borrowed from Winston Groom but didn't do as well. When Groom needed a plot twist, he created a satisfying logical construct or at least a possible one. Jonasson just pulls stuff out of the air. There's no objective reason for anything. An elephant flattens a guy, a life-long criminal decides to give it up and hide behind bibles--it's all farce. Grooms approach was fantasy-comedic; Jonasson goes straight to Monty Python.<br /><br />In fact, if you like Monty Python or any of the theater of the absurd you may love 100YOM. For my part, I found it derivative and tedious. What Groom did masterfully in 257 pages, Jonasson feels the need to drag out for over 400.<br /><br />The last thing to criticize is the lack of pay-off. Gump ends up with his and Jenny's love-child son creating a genuine heart-warming moment. The 100YOM ends up with an 84 year old moron and all he can drink.

1554072840|4.0|got this to help my daughter with going #2 in the potty, she started #1 in the potty a few days after her 2nd birthday, just decided \\"mommy I want use toilet\\". But #2 is still an issue and requires a diaper or she will hold it to the point of causing issues. This book so far hasn't helped with #2 getting to the potty. Still \\"need diaper poo poo coming\\" is the Q for what to do. Maybe after a few more 100 times of reading it will help but so far not so much again with #2, we had already gotten #1 to the potty before purchase of the book so no idea on that one.

It's kind of depressing....The story line is a little intriguing...Some of the situations (outside the BDSM) hit a little close to home for me, so I find myself wanting to continue reading this, but it is far from being \\"explicit\\" (try reading more pornographic stories, this is nothing in comparison). Christian Grey is an addicting character, and now I just keep picturing Ryan Gosling, but I can say if they are turning this into a movie, all I can do is  hope they reaaaaaally work on improving the script first. It had potential, but her book honestly sounds like a first draft to what a 17 year old girl who recently discovered her sexual side would write. I also feel like the only time Anastasia has a personality is when she's writing e-mails.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Great classic family movie! :-) every family should watch this movie at least once in their lifetime....it's hard to find good, fun, wholesome movies for your family to watch together anymore.
0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves is one of the most profound books I've ever read.  Very difficult to read, but immensely rewarding.  The book reads like a thesis paper (with intriguingly personal footnotes) but the story is so engrossing that you want to finish it, no matter how difficult it is to read.  As the title of this review states, this book is proof that some books will NEVER work as an ebook.  Word and pages are layed out in such a way that you feel the frenetic energy of the story as it progresses.  Geniusly layed out, the words and passages in House of Leaves draw you in like nothing you've ever seen before.  Can't recommend this book enough.  Truly one of the modern classics of our times.
B000VAPZM2|5.0|This movie was just as good as the first one.  I kept laughing throughout the whole movie.  It was awesome
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. It has lots of games to choose from. I love that it is a lot of mini-games and not just one main game.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My family and I love this movie!  I enjoy the DVD extras and the video quality is great on the kindle fire
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|In this AVC encoded, 1080p transfer in 1.78: 1, this movie pops. The level of clarity is great, lines and detail are sharp and even though a lot of the movie is dark, it doesn't ever look muddy or hard to see. The special features while aren't plentiful are still pretty good. I am looking forward to the Joss Whedon commentary track as well as the Marvel one shot short film that premiered at Comic Con, Item 47. There are a bunch of deleted scenes, a few featurettes and a gag reel. I wouldn't be surprised if they put out a few more editions of this movie with more features in the coming years. For now, this is good enough for me, especially since  I bought this for the movie and the movie itself isn't going to look any cleaner or sharper than this.
B00846REIS|2.0|This book seemed like a carbon copy of 50 Shades of Grey.  There were too many coincidences and you could predict what would happen due to these similarities. The story was poorly written with little for the imagination. I would not recommend this book
B0050PYNOY|5.0|Granted this was the first movie I saw with my girlfriend in the theater so I may be biased (maybe not a great 1st movie to see with a girl you just started dating) but I like this movie. Having grown up in the `80's, I like fantasy art and film. This movie borrows from the best aspects of both of these and even has a Henson like muppet in a scene. The acting is hammy, but on purpose and the sets and costumes are over the top. The digital effects are well done as well as the sets and most of the production value on this movie Is really high and well designed. Maybe this movie isn't as funny as lots would have liked it to be, but I thought it was raunchy and clever. The fight scenes are cool, the location shoots look great and there is lots of hot female nudity. It's a shame this movie didn't do better since fantasy epics are so few and far between. If you like ad-libbed lines and stoner comedies and fantasy movies, then you should like this just fine. The negative reviews I really don't understand. I've been with my girlfriend for almost two years now and I've yet to hear her use a bad word and she didn't think this movie was too offensive or raunchy. Sure it's not family friendly, but most of the best movies aren't. This movie is great escapism.
B004FRX0MY|1.0|So - last year in May 2011 I got a Droid. Loved it but the music player is lame compared to iTunes. (Seriously? Google?) (I expect it from Microsoft - every MS Windows-based music player I have ever touched has been below lame.) I didn't care for Pandora - I like to play my music. I hadn't discovered Spotify yet. I jumped on the Amazon MP3 player with both feet! It was not snazzy but it is functional.<br /><br />So I upload some of my music in the 5G of space they give us for free... then they say \\"Hey!!! All music storage is FREE!! If it's MP3 then store it all here!!\\" SO I UPLOAD the REST of my music.<br /><br />I am a dinosaur so have CD's from the BEGINNING OF TIME. I have lots of friends in bands so there is lots of music that won't ever be for sale on Amazon. It is all ripped into iTunes - and on an old iPod Photo 60G. (The 4g iPod still lives - but due to an almost DOA battery is permanently docked to a clock radio in my bedroom.) So over the next few weekends I open the laptop, start the Amazon MP3 uploader and let it run. And run. And run. 9000 songs later I have most of my music in the Cloud. And then I start pulling it down to the Droid. (A Samsung Charge on Verizon - a nice phone - good reception with Verizon but watch for extras getting tacked onto your phone bill - \\"City ID\\" is one that is $2 a month for virtually nothing! oops!! I digress!)<br /><br />After a month I was all done.<br /><br />Then in August 2012 I get an email that Amazon is pulling support from their MP3 player for music I import beyond 250 songs (250 - how laughable! NOT!) ... unless I pay $24.95 a year?<br /><br />Even though the price is reasonable - I still feel like - for the first time ever Amazon has done a BAIT AND SWITCH. When they said last year, 5Gigs is free - I used my allotment and no more. When they said \\"It's free!\\" I put some work into it and uploaded ALL of my music.<br /><br />Because I thought it was going to be free FOREVER. Amazon was going to be in charge of my music storage and organization -- so my music would be safe. And the software would be functional and play with multiple vendors or providers - where ever my smartphone/tablet/thingamajiggy roads lead in the future..... FREE. I spent a month getting everything fixed. Perfect. The playlists cleaned up... Dupes removed. Song titles entered for those homemade CDs.... then I find find out Amazon has changed their mind - to the tune of $25 bucks a year just months later?<br /><br />And somehow I have missed the window to get the music out of their stupid cloud. (I only traveled 25K miles last month, go figure!!) Now I have to re-rip some CD's that have already gone into one of the CD changers... I got to try and remember which albums I bought at music performances in the last year. I've got to GET RIGHT WITH GOD and Lucinda Williams about making sure I got all that woman's music on my permanently attached electronic-appendage. Adele is there. Lady Gaga is there. Where is Gillian Welch's 8 albums? Let see I have 2 Kelly Goodlad songs but am missing 4 more.... Do I really only own one Lenka song and one by Robyn? THIS IS PAINFUL. P-A-I-N-F-U-L. And that is just The Girls.... Wait until I start working on The Boys.<br /><br />I am still mad almost two months later. Spelling words out - M-A-D-MAD? Yes. I am just that mad.<br /><br />If I want to download the Music from the Amazon Cloud Drive - where all my music still resides in safety but where I can NOT PLAY IT - I have to do it one song a time.... And I cannot \\"download\\" an entire playlist. I cannot access my playlist. I cannot play my music on any computer in the world any where any time. I was sold one thing. It was free. I worked to that end. Now it is not free. I am usually not this cheap - promise. I am just that mad.<br /><br />Two other complaints: I use a netbook most of the time. The Cloud player and the Cloud Drive's web interface are not respectful of the size limitations of the screen. The \\"Artist\\" column cannot be expanded for example. You can't sort by Genre either. I got around this by creating Playlists in iTunes defined as: \\"display all with genre = Rhythm and Blues\\" -- but yea, now my playlists are gone unless I fork over $24.95. I can live with such out of free software. But if you charge money it better darn-tooting be nicely functional ok?<br /><br />Last - the Droid App took over my phone and possessed it this past weekend. I was actually able to use the player on the phone still -- to go through and check what I had added recently. Afterwards I closed the App with the Task Manager. Then THE BIG BROTHERS at Amazon.com started Pushing a \\"you must agree to this\\" message every 10 minutes whether I was using the app or not. I seriously mean, I was on the phone with my mother and the phone dropped out and this Amazon Screen was displayed. I was playing Scrabble and the Amazon Screen took over. I was performing and recording the performance and the Amazon Screen took over and stopped the recording. I was reading Email and the Amazon Screen took over. At that point in time I deleted this app, the Amazon Marketplace app, the Amazon Price Checker app, the Amazon Student app, The Amazon shopping app.... And I seriously considered LEAVING THE AMAZON VINE PROGRAM and DELETING ALL MY REVIEWS and DELETING MY ACCOUNT HERE. COMPLETELY and TOTALLY.<br /><br />Oh my!!! For the first time EVER. E.V.E.R. Amazon has got on my BAD SIDE.<br /><br />Thank you for listening. I am sorry for this rant. I promise to be my normal, happy, down-to-earth self... next year sometime!!!<br /><br />Yes.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book held so much promise as i started to read it.  the author dropped the ball.  i hate books written by chicks. This book completely  portrays the vast difference in male female wiring , a knight in armor fantasy so far removed from reality it is unrelateable.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|love it. cant stop playing it but should ginger out more coins and not have to wait to get more coins.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I love this book so much!!  This book was suggested after I read FSOG and did not disappoint me.  I loved Travis, although he has some serious anger problems.  Abbey was an okay heroine.  I also loved the supporting characters; which is not always the case.  I actually hope that the author will make more stories about the supporting characters.  The book was different and was an emotional rollercoaster.  The only thing I did not like about the book was some misplaced storylines.  For example there was a short scene in Vegas and with her father that I thought was pointless.  The author should have explored that storyline or left it out completely.  This book is easily one of my favorites.<br /><br />**This book is not for everyone.  There is violence and emotional instability, but to me that is real life**
B007RTAR64|5.0|She is one of the most detailed dolls I've ever seen! She is holding up really well, and you can give her lots of poses on her doll stand. I love her so much!!!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Each Saturday I take a few hours out of my day and spend it in the desperate search of new music; not just any music - Something different, something fresh, an artist who is truly unique and stands out from the crowd. I've become so bored of today's mainstream music options, where artists must rely on autotune to make themselves sound good.<br /><br />With Lindsey Stirling, not only do you get a talented young artist, but someone who truly knows who they are,and continues to stick to their values. Each song that she puts out there is one of a kind. From dubstep violin, to haunting melodies such as \\"Song of the Caged Bird\\" to power packed songs like \\"Shadows\\"  .... and don't forget to YouTube her take on Phantom of the Opera, Lord of the Rings, and Game of Thrones. She puts her own twist on each song she does whether it be something new or a song that's been around for awhile. The energy she puts forth into each song makes it well worth the listen.<br /><br />Please take time to view some of her videos on YouTube as well because with Lindsey, her music is only part of the package deal. The dance she incorporates into her videos along with the cinematography of Devin Graham, make each video a feast for the eyes and ears.<br /><br />This is her first album, but it definitely won't be the last. You are seeing the beginnings of an artist who is sure to be legendary!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I went in reading this novel with great expectations and for a while it did a good job satisfying them. But what could have been an extraordinary story written by lovely prose was tainted by the \\"morale\\" or \\"aesop\\" at the end. I don't want to spoil anything for people who haven't read it, so all I'm gonna say is I can't get behind a message that is quite judgmental and illogical such as this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great. I have the free version on my kindle fire. The pop up ads are a little annoying but it's easy to close them. This is a great app for solitaire lover's!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Well, my title says it all. This game is on my kindle fire, and it doesn't slow down or shut off like some other apps. It is so fun, challenging ,and funny. I HIGHLY reccomend it!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so much fun me and my friend love ti sit down and play it. try it u will love it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app. there's lots of neat ideas to make things and design. so much to look at. I don't goa day with getting on here
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie is a sobering glimpse into the lives of the men and women who fight for our freedom.  It was very well done and a \\"must see\\"!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This is a fabulous story with characters that you become very involved with!  I could not wait until the end of the day so I could dive back into it. Highly recommend!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|I have followed Lee Child's books for many years & await his new books with anticipation. It was an excellent plot as usual but the description of things I found too much. Overall a good read though.
B006S009IY|5.0|I have loved this movie for years, and I also have loved sharing it with friends and family.  Having recommended it a year or so ago to a wonderful couple that are friends of mine, but hearing for over a year that although they added it to their Netflix queue, it still had not made its way to the top..., I decided to send them the DVD as a gift.  This was their response after they watched it:<br /><br />\\"We loved \\"Finding Neverland\\"! Thank you so much for the DVD. I have a renewed appreciation for Johnny Depp (love how he foreshadowed his famous pirate role in this movie) and Kate was extraordinary. But the kids' performances also really blew us away. I looked over at Robert during the scene where they recreate the play at Sylvia's house, and his face was all wet and he was having trouble breathing. Hmmm. There must have been an allergen in the air.\\"<br /><br />-- Needless to say, my great taste for quality cinema won the day again!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Enjoying this game very much! I like the bright colors and smooth action. I've played many of the levels several times!
B008NR8YTQ|4.0|The late rock & blues guitarist & singer-songwriter Gary Moore (who died in 2011) pays great homage to legendary late guitar maestro Jimi Hendrix in 2007 (London Hippodrome) in this great CD release titled 'Blues For Jimi : Live In London'. This CD (12 tracks) captures Gary Moore playing blues rock music from Jimi Hendrix's early works : Gary Moore is incredibly great on guitar & vocals that would make both Gary's & Jimi's fans very proud. One can almost hear as if Jimi Hendrix is playing as on \\"Hey Joe\\", an indication of how Gary Moore can match the brilliance of Jimi Hendrix's style of guitar playing in this CD! Gary Moore is also joined by Mitch Mitchell (on drums) & Billy Cox (on bass) of the Jimi Hendrix Experience band in the bluesy 18 minutes gem \\"Red House\\", \\"Stone Free\\" & my favourite \\" Hey Joe\\". Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" (wonderful guitar work, melody & vocals), \\"Angel\\" (incredible slow-tempo track), \\"Red House\\" & \\"Hey Joe\\" (beautiful guitar work as Jimi would play, great melody & vocals). Great tracks include the opening track \\"Purple Haze\\", \\"Manic Depression\\", \\"Foxey Lady\\", \\"I Don't Live Today\\", \\"Fire\\", \\"Stone Free\\" & the closing track \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\". Okay track is \\"My Angel\\".<br /><br />On overall, Gary Moore brings Jimi Hendrix's great blues rock music back to life in this tribute titled 'Blues For Jimi' which fans of both legends could be pround of. A recommended CD listening.
B001GQ2BNQ|4.0|Just a little background for context: I can swim (duh) but I've never been a strong swimmer. For the past 3 months I've been on a pretty serious gym routine (4x/week) in order to lose weight and get back in shape. It's worked, but the routine was getting old (though still effective). The gym where I go has an indoor lap pool so I thought I would mix things up and start swimming once or twice a week. I bought this snorkel hoping to improve my technique and not look like an idiot gassing out mid-lap.<br /><br />The product itself is solid. Well-made and a good design. Kind of expensive but I'd rather pay a little more and not have to replace something in 6 months, so the cost is negligible for me. So how does it work?<br /><br />Well, my first time using it it became obvious I could not breath in and out through my mouth without getting water in my nose. As a former diver it occurred to me that when I've used either a regulator or snorkel in the past I've always had a mask that covered my nose. The manual/instructions for this snorkel even says that you \\"might need a nose clip.\\"<br /><br />So, I bought a nose clip (which proved impossible locally, Amazon to the rescue...yet again). While waiting on the nose clip I started using a pull buoy and hand paddles with very good results (which for me is just getting a good workout in and improving my horrible technique, if you can even call it that). When my nose clip came in I tried the snorkel again, and it works fine.<br /><br />I guess the bottom line is that I don't need it the way I thought I did. Maybe as I get stronger and transition away from the paddles/buoy this will become more helpful, but if I were to do it all over again I would have waited until I was to the point of really being able to gain a lot from it. So I'm not disappointed, but I'm not blown away either. And through no fault of the product, it just didn't improve my workout (yet). I'll update this review in the next few months and let you know what changes, if anything.nges, if anything.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|The legendary singer-songwriter John Hiatt is back in 2012 with a great follow-up CD release to his 2011 critically acclaimed CD release 'Dirty Jeans & Mudslide Hymns', titled 'Mystic Pinball'. This new CD (12 tracks) sees John Hiatt as if taking off where his left in the CD release 'Dirty Jeans & Mudslide Hymns' : the album is more 'rocky' in parts & John Hiatt has introduced great harmonies as in the first single & opening track \\"We're Alright Now\\", \\"One Of Them Damn Days\\" & \\"Give It Up\\" as compared to his 2011 CD. The production is excellent & he has a great execution of good compositions. Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"I Just Don't Know What To Say\\" (wonderful melody & vocals), \\"I Know How To Lose You\\" (beautiful melody, guitar work & vocals), \\"No Wicked Grin\\" (a slow-tempo track with incredible guitar, melody & vocals) & \\"Give It Up\\" (up-tempo track with great melody & harmonies). Great tracks include \\"We're Alright Now' (great harmonies & melody), \\"Wood Chipper\\" (would also fit nicely with songs in 2011 CD), \\"My Business\\", \\"You're The Reason I Need\\" & \\"Blues Can't Even Find Me\\" (great guitar). Okay tracks are the mid-tempo \\"Bite Marks\\" & \\"It All Comes Back Someday\\".<br /><br />On overall, John Hiatt doesn't disappoint in this new CD release 'Mystic Pinball', a recommended CD listening.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This is my new favorite book. I've read it twice in 2 weeks! The characters are real and believable. Ever girl dreams of a Travis.
B008SVFX96|4.0|The talented Bon Jovi band member & rock guitarist/singer-songwriter Richie Sambora is back with his third solo CD release titled 'Aftermath Of The Lowdown'. Richie Sambora is regarded by many as one of the greatest guitarists in rock music today : you'll get some wonderful guitar work in this great rock CD (11 tracks) to showcase his talent with the guitar. But his vocals are great too, just listen to his vocal range in the wonderful track \\"You Can Only Get So High\\". Get ready to rock the house down while listening to this CD release, some great compositions, production & execution. Stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Every Road Leads Home To You\\" (great pop-rock track), \\"Weathering The Storm\\" (incredible guitar work, melody & vocals), \\"Seven Years Gone\\" (mid-tempo pop-rock track with a great melody), \\"You Can Only Get So High\\" (wonderful guitar work & great vocal range) & the closing track \\"World\\" (beautiful violin & melody).  Great tracks include \\"Taking A Chance On The Wind\\", \\"I'll Always Walk Beside You\\" (slow-tempo mellow track with great guitar chords & melody) & \\"Learning To Fly With A Broken Wing\\". Okay tracks are \\"Burn That Candle Down\\", \\"Nowadays\\" & \\"Sugar Daddy\\".<br /><br />On overall,  Richie Sambora is back with an entertaining rock album (a good combination of classic & hard rock), a recommended CD listening. If you liked Richie Sambora's previous two solo albums, you'll love this CD.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Bought this for my nephew. But ended up me and my siblings and my mom are playing with it when my nephew is not playing.<br />Had fun with it, LEGO bricks are the best set for creativity and it is not restrained by some other theme set where the bricks design are made to serve for specific function; eg. we made roof from 4625 set's tree, but you can't make other stuff out from the theme set's tree; it still serves function of tree no matter what you did.<br /><br />Cons: 2X2 bricks of this set have the auto-pop-out function if you do not press really hard onto other bricks, and it will cause your built up easily collapse<br />Pros: LEGO offered to replace my parts :) GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!
B008SOS63S|5.0|Blues guitar maestro & prolific singer-songwriter Joe Bonamassa has released his third album so far in 2012 ('Live Over Europe' as part of the rock supergroup Black Country Communion (BCC) & his solo 'Driving Towards The Daylight'), a live blues double CD titled 'Beacon Theatre : Live From New York'. The double CD (20 tracks), is a wonderful blues album (covers his solo career up to his betseller CD 'Dust Bowl', incredible guitar work from the blues guitar maestro as one would expect and much more & his great collaborations with featured artists in rock lead vocalist Paul Rogers, Beth Hart & legendary country singer-songwriter John Hiatt in this live album). Overall production and sound quality is good for a live recording. It's a great compliment to the DVD of the same title/name released earlier in the year.<br /><br />Disc 1 (11 tracks) : stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include \\"Slow Train\\" (incredibly beautiful guitar work & vocals), \\"When The Fire Hits The Sea\\" (wonderful melody, guitar/piano combination & vocals), \\"Midnight Blues\\", \\"Dust Bowl\\" & \\"The River\\". Great tracks include the opening track \\"72nd St. Subway Blues\\" (great guitar solo), \\"Cradle Rock\\" (late Irish singer-songwriter Rory Gallegher's composition) , \\"I'll Take Care Of You\\" (slow-tempo track, great duet featuring Beth Hart), \\"You Better Watch Yourself\\" & \\"Steat Your Heart Away\\" (up-tempo track). Okay track is \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" (featuring Beth Hart on vocals). This is my favourite CD of the two.<br /><br />Disc 2 (9 tracks) : stand-outs/gems/solid tracks include the opening track \\"Bird On A Wire\\" (mellow, slow-tempo beautiful track), \\"Mountain Time\\" (incredible guitar work & piano), \\"If Heartaches Were Nickels\\" (another slow tempo mellow track with a wonderful melody, vocals & drums/piano combination). Great tracks include \\"Down Around My Place\\" (a great country track from 2011 John Hiatt's CD release 'Dirty Jeans & Mudslide Hymns', a great duet featuring the legendary John Hiatt), \\"I Know The Place\\" (a country blues track from John Hiatt, featuring him again), \\"Blue & Evil\\" (great guitar work on this rocky blues track), the two tracks from the rock band Free with lead vocalist Paul Rogers (Bad Company, Free and recently with Queen) featuring in \\"Walk In My Shadows\\" and \\"Fire And Water\\" & \\"Young Man Blues\\" (incredible guitar work).<br /><br />On overall, you have a 2 CD release by a prolific singer-songwriter & blues guitar maestro Joe Bonamassa : great live blues music, good production, sound quality for a live recording & execution including great collaboration with featured artists (Beth Hart, John Hiatt & Paul Rogers). A well deserved 5 star performance & a highly recommended CD listening pleasure.

B003BWQEOU|5.0|2 HEAVY VINYLS AND A SIGNED JARMUSCH PORTRAIT OF WAITS ON COTTON FIBER PAPER. AWESOME! A MUST FOR ANY OLD AND NEW TOM WAITS LISTENERS. BRAVO. I WISH ALL VINYLS HAD THIS MUCH TO OFFER FOR THE PRICE.
B0099G7KDQ|3.0|This album is not bad, but it's not great either...definitely not as great as Sigh No More.  The album starts incredibly strong; the first track is probably my favorite off the entire album, but after a few songs it slows down quite a bit and each song starts sounding like the last, and the question, \\"Is that the same banjo riff I heard in the last two songs?\\" inevitably creeps into the mind.  Considering the long and impressive journey their first album took to reach the popularity it eventually did, the Sons had a LOT to live up to.  This is a fine effort by the band, but I will admit it left me a bit underwhelmed.  With that said, there are certainly some gems on this album and an overall nostalgia that make it worth picking up.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My review might be a bit premature,since I've only begun reading it on my Kindle Fire.  I prefer that format to the paperback, since I'm able to adjust the size of the font.  I enjoyed having each of the major characters introduced at the beginning. I'm looking forward to reading the entire series.
0425263908|4.0|ok i bought this book because there were so many mixed reviews.<br />what i liked- the story was entertaining, her writing style didnt bother me and i do want to read the next book to see what happen's<br />what i didn't like- it was way to close to fifty shades without the graphic content and the charecters are not as interesting as fifty.<br />i will continue to read her books for now to see what she does next.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am so glad he wrote this book.  It is refreshing to hear the truth for once.  I cannot find enough words to thank these wonderful men for what they do for our country.  I pray for them everyday. I wish our country took better care of all our service people.  Thak you so much for writing this.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great book. Describes main character's struggles n determination. Did not glorify him as a person and isn't as exaggerating as lone survivor. I enjoyed this book a lot. Thumbs up
B001HN694K|5.0|Everything I expected in the children's fable.  Johnny Depp did wonderful work here, and brought a sense of humanity to the mad hatter.  JD brought this childhood tale to life for me.  Ty JD.  I will continue to look to more works from you.  Job well done.  Trust God and Love People!  We really do need more movies as this.  It brings people back to the values God intends for us.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Gone Girl was well written and witty. I loved her keen observations and vivid descriptions of people and places.  But as the novel drew to a  close, the author ran out of steam. The ending was hideous. I'm okay with an unsatisfying ending sometimes--if it's done well. This one was NOT. At first, I thought I was missing something. After pondering it, I'm convinced I wasn't missing anything. The ending stunk. I wish I'd saved my money and checked it out at the library.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A great way to describe life after the zombie apocalypse. I would say this is more a human centered book than a zombie book, but still a must read for zombie fans!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I'm not upset I downloaded this one.  good freebie.  puzzles are diverse and don't take too long to complete. you can even get extra packs of puzzles as an add on.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|This was a very interesting movie. The concept is frightening, to think this may come to be. Movies have a way of predicting the future.  I did have a problem with Children killing Children not only used to punish communities for their  uprising against corrupt governance and to keep any future uprising suppressed but used for entertainment for the \\"good, compliant people\\".  Disturbing.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|we have seen this movie in 2d before. the 3d version is like watching a whole new movie. great 3d effects, and intersting story line.
B008LZHA3G|2.0|I didn't get it, I gave it four listens all through hoping to be enlightened; a new CD of musical and lyrical cliches struggling to past muster; for me it's weak compared to some of the tracks on Modern Times which really have a sense of deep humanity: anyway I don't need to hear an old man growling to show that he still has the flame. Sorry, not for me this time.

B004UID2LC|5.0|Not much to say except if you're used to Firefox's \\"downloadhelper\\" then this should be right up your alley. Basically, what you do is \\"long press\\" a video or song on youtube while using your android/kindle and a series of options will pop up to download the video/song. It will even ask if you want it to convert a file which comes in handy and works relatively fast.<br /><br />I've probably had it crash on me once or twice, but it hasn't caused any nagging problems for the android. I highly recommend downloading this.

030758836X|5.0|I was up until 2am finishing this book. Even though I was incredibly tired, I couldn't put it down until I figured out how it ended. In fact, I started reading it the night before we left for our Estes Park vacation and had to force myself to keep it shut until on the way home so I wouldn't ignore my family the whole time we were away. Once it was open again, I was completely absorbed in the twists and turns of this story.<br /><br />Updated to add - one of the things I think really appealed to me about this story is that it was set in Carthage, MO area, which is close to where I grew up. I was very familiar with the setting and the characters being referred to throughout the book.<br /><br />I don't want to give anything away, but Gone Girl is a story about marriage, relationships and revenge with a whole lot of crazy thrown in. It's a thrilling, twisted, insanely good read. I felt like the ending could have given a bit more closure, but other than that, loved it. I gave it 5 Stars.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|it's the best and so is jet pack joy ride.you must get it.you will love it and show it to your friend.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I had just seen The Expendables 2 in the theatre but had missed the first one. I found it available on Amazon for a good price, so I ordered it.<br />Delivery was prompt.<br />I would rate it \\"good\\" but not quite as enjoyable as #2. Expendables 2 had a good blend of grit and humor which was lacking somewhat in #1.<br />It is a rarity to find a sequel better than it's predecessor but this is it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It's more prescise than the one that pops out from the menu. I just flip from app to app and see how much time I have left to do all of the things that I love!
B001NLKXK2|4.0|My father had Alzheimers. I thought the depiction was both accurate and sympathetic. The writing was skillful and powerful. However, I think the book missed some of the horrors of later stage Alzheimers - sundowner syndrome and the awful fear and confusion they experience. That was the worst part of the disease and the book did not address it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Very enlightening!  Not only did it chronicle the operation leading to the death of THE terrorist of our time, but it also provided interesting insight into the daily lives of our SEALS.  I really enjoyed this book.  It was a fast read and had my heart literally racing at times.  I was surprised by how easy to read it was, as I expected to be lost in a lot of military and technical jargon.  But the book flowed very well and had a compelling story.  Of course, that is because it is a true story about events that affected us all.<br /><br />I can not say enough how thankful I am for the sacrifices these people make on behalf of us all.  God bless them and keep them safe.<br />J:)
B008C1O8CA|5.0|(Full disclosure:  im a huge fan of Green Day so may not be the most critical...but read on....)<br /><br />After releasing not one, but two incredibly impressive \\"concept\\" albums,  Green Day returns to their roots:  an album of quick pop-punk tunes.  As a longtime fan of the band i was, of course,  stoked for new material.  I was, however, skeptical for the following reasons:  1) Their last album of stand alone tunes,  Warning,  had some good tracks but felt like a misstep compared to previous albums,  2) With all the press about the upcomming release of 3 albums in a row I wondered if they were just taking 1 or 1 1/2 albums worth and spreading it across 3 for $$$ OR would the songs be kinda meh since they had to make so many.....well im excatic to say that Uno! is OUTSTANDING!  There is not a bad tune on there.  Its 12 rocking songs and as soon as i finished my first listen,  i hit play again.  I will be playing this alot and cant wait to see what else they have in store on the next 2 albums!<br /><br />peace .n. Tunage.

0307719219|4.0|Why Nations Fail<br /><br />An excellent book similar in focus to Niall Ferguson's \\"Civilization: The West and the Rest\\", and similar in outlook as well.<br /><br />The main essential elements that are necessary to make a nation successful, in the view of the authors, are a sufficiently centralized government to insure personal security, individual property rights, and rule of universally equally applied law.<br />They think that governmental institutions should be what they call inclusive rather than extractive, having a broad pluralistic base rather than using the population as a source of labor, taxes or other rent-seeking behavior that benefits a minority at the expense of the general population.<br /><br />Schumpeter's concept of creative destruction is also firmly embraced by the authors. In their view, change and the ability to welcome new technology and use it to advantage is as essential to a nation's progress as it is to human development. Historically, entrenched elites resisted any change that had the potential to reduce their existing superior position. They use the example of railroads where England embraced them and Austria forbade them, and the result was the movement of goods and people from the farms to the cities that promoted the industrial revolution in England and kept a repressive feudalistic society in Austria where the status quo was maintained at the expense of the population.<br /><br />The authors use many examples to support their idea of extractive vs. inclusive economies. The Kingdom of the Kongo came in contact with the Portuguese in 1483. They adopted Christianity and firearms, but not the wheel, the plow, or other productivity enhancing technologies of the time. This was, according to the authors, a result of a society that was what we would call a kleptocracy. Any gains the people could achieve were confiscated by the king, so there was no incentive to use technology to improve their lives.<br />They don't agree with Jared Diamond's geography based determinism or Samuel Huntington's culture and religion based views. They use the examples of Nogales Sonora vs. Nogales Arizona and Natal and Transkei to show places where the culture and geography were the same, but the outcome was drastically different.<br /><br />An important quote, early in the book, crystalizes the main thesis, \\"The main obstacle to the adoption of policies that would reduce market failures and encourage economic growth is not the ignorance of politicians, but the incentives and constraints they face from the political and economic institutions in their societies.\\"<br /><br />In the eyes of the authors, a lack of shared freedom is why nations fail. It is a timely book.

B008J34466|2.0|I love Pink and was anxiously awaiting this cd. She has an excellent singing voice so I'm not sure why she felt the need to use a computer to change the sound of her voice in almost all the songs.  And as another reviewer said, a lot of odd juvenile yelling and lyrics.  I think she is an excellent artist so I would have liked to see her do what she does best, but I don't hear it on this cd outside of a few songs. I hope it wears on me, but I'm not sure it will. Really disappointed.
B007TMON8M|4.0|Getting to build something and then watch it (hopefully!) work is very satisfying. Great animations on the levels. Being able to observe the stress points is a huge help (tap the upper left corner during a test). I'd love to play another set of levels - earning 3 stars on these was an enjoyable challenge!
B00005JMFQ|2.0|With such an exceptionally talented and for the most part beautiful cast, one wishes to confess a sense of embarrassment about the utter tastelessness, cynicism, and stupidity of nearly every moment in this overly long film. What prevents this feeling from coming to fruition is the extent to which most actors in the ensemble convey their own nudging, winking awareness of how dreadful their dialogue and implausible the dramatic context of their work here is. The entire production conveys an air of the Stockholm syndrome; half the cast seem to have been brainwashed into believing the treacle they are declaiming is actually comedy, while the other half seem to be blinking SOS with every close-up.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this is truly a manipulative and hateful film. Under the guise of Christmas, a ludicrously affluent roster of petulant and self-indulgent Londoners--who would make the cast of Woody Allen's no-less hateful film Match Point look like a group of extras from Cry Freedom--lie, betray one another, confess their cynical manipulativeness, and are rewarded generally with consequence-free sex and all-is-forgiven good cheer. Ebeneezer Scrooge has a better sense of \\"the true meaning of Christmas\\" than the director, Richard Curtis, of this film.<br /><br />If there is one story-line and actor who could be said to redeem at least his own camera time--less than 15 of the 135 minutes of the total--it is the ingratiatingly cynical Bill Nighy, whose jaded rock-star character constantly expresses both his contempt for an audience that would actually listen to his music while desperately hoping that his recording (of a Christmas carol, needless to say) will be a hit. He telegraphs the essential message of this movie, which has nothing to do with love, actually, and everything to do with cadging profits from spectators alleged to be too stupid to understand the difference. The climax of his story, when on Christmas Eve he decides to abandon his rock-star lifestyle in order to get drunk with his manager and watch porn, strikes a note of near-nobility not because it substitutes for the relentless conventionality of the other on-screen romances, but precisely because it doesn't (and can't).<br /><br />By contrast, particular distinction goes to Alan Rickman, who phones in the most lifeless, lugubrious, and preposterous performance of the ensemble as an executive who wishes to bring his employees together romantically--there are by the lights of this movie NO restrictions regarding workplace sexual harassment in England?--while ostensibly grappling with an office romance of his own as Emma Thompson dutifully stays at home minding his picture-perfect family. Although he deserves credit for offering perhaps the most Brechtian performance in a Romantic Comedy since Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator, one is confused by the end of the film as to whether he is in fact the film's undertaker or its cadaver.<br /><br />Speaking of Brecht and the Great Dictator, no review would be complete without calling out the obvious, scandalous ease with which Richard Curtis exploits the still-fresh occurrence of the 9/11 catastrophe and the just begun Iraq War to inject Hugh Grant's unctuous portrayal of a bachelor British Prime Minister with a fraudulent political consciousness AND a crudely jingoistic caricature of the Anglo-American alliance. Yes, in a world where Hugh Grant could be a convincing substitute for a British Prime Minister, Billy Bob Thornton's cameo hybrid of Bill Clinton's leer and George W. Bush's sneer could be a convincing parody of \\"the ugly American.\\" But if one doesn't buy the former, one won't believe the latter either--and the ugliness of both gives the lie to the film's claim to portray \\"love.\\"<br /><br />While writing this review I struggled to decide not how many but how few stars to award it. The fact that it doesn't even descend to a one-star rating, but stands slightly redeemed by the other, better achievements of itsensemble--with the exception, perhaps, of Hugh Grant, who doesn't seem to have any work outside of his collaboration with Richard Curtis in films even more forgettable and pathetic than this--is itself evidence of this film's resilient and enduring mediocrity. There are many, many romantic comedies shorter, funnier, and sweeter than this. If you haven't seen this movie yet, do yourself a favor: DON'T.
B0079TQHDO|2.0|As always extremely readable author  but story waffled along and by the end of the book was a bit disappointed as had no real substance. Will I read the next(final?) book? Probably.
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|I was surprised how addictive I have found this game. I am not one to play a lot of games, just from a lack of time standpoint, therefore if I play a game, I like it to stretch my mind a bit. This combines math and tetris  strategy to make for a relatively entertaining 10 minutes.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This hot book by E L James, althoug is very interesting, I think that is better for women, as the author is a woman and tells the story mostly from a feminine point of view, at least in this firs volume of the trilogy. Summarizing: excellent choice for women who want to boost their sexual fantasies.

B0063GORYU|5.0|great for sitting in front of tv or when one just wants some easy entertainment.  try it out a few times and you will be hooked.

B008NR8YTQ|5.0|Perhaps this 2007 concert with Gary Moore playing the music of Jimi Hendrix would not have been oficially released if it wasn't for Gary's leaving his body in 2011. But anyway it's a pure delight also for Jimi Hendrix fans as Gary truly plays the classic tracks with conviction and adventurous spirit.<br /><br />The repertoire almost exclusively focuses on Jimi's early numbers, the \\"Are You Experienced?\\" songs we all love, staying true to the originals he probably sat and played along to as a kid. At the same time he is Gary Moore and infuses his own unique style, not least in the long, beautiful \\"Red House\\".<br /><br />Backed competently by Dave Bronze (Procol Harum, Eric Clapton a.m.o.)on the bass and Darrin Mooney (Primal Scream) on drums everything get a further infusion with the appearance of original Hendrix musicians Billy Cox and Mitch Mithchell for 3 tracks. Although Mithchell's playing is a bit rusty still its the \\"real thing\\" as Gary says.<br /><br />Two late guitar heroes and a joy for lovers of power trio, clasic rock and the glorious days of psychedelic guitar.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Outstanding insight to U.S. Navy Seals and what they do.  The author's explanation for writing the book made sense.  He just wanted to set the record straight and was tired of the mis-information being reported about the raid that killed Bin Laden.  Thank you to the author for this book and for what he and his fellow Seals have done for this country.

B008LZHA3G|3.0|Yes, the man is one of the all-time greatest.  And, yes, he can still write a song as intelligent, mysterious and elusive as ever.  But the years of constant touring and cigarettes have finally taken their toll.  He sounds like the older brother of Tom Waits after a week of all-night benders.  Which is too bad because the material is really, really good.  If you can get past the vocals, you'll find some excellent songs here.  I wasn't able to do it.  But it can't be denied that the man's wit and wry brilliance remains intact.  If only the voice could get back to, at the very least, a 'Time Out of Mind' level.  I know that's wishful thinking.  Sooo...with five star songs and one star vocals, I average it out to a three star effort overall.

B008SOS63S|5.0|I saw the concert DVD with the same song list as well as listened to the CD. My comments on the DVD below as well as supportive review information included will hopefully assist the listener as they are both exceptional.<br /><br />I read, \\"Joe did play two shows at the Beacon. Footage from both shows, mostly Saturday, was used for the DVD. First song up is Slow Train. With two minutes to midnight playing in the background, the stage goes black. The train is coming! Joe rips into Slow Train. Next song Joe plays is Cradle Rock.\\" Rory Gallagher would be proud.<br /><br />17 songs later you let your breath out as you can't remember if you had taken one since the concert started. And that pretty much sums up how I feel every time I play or watch a new offering by Mr. JB.<br /><br />You grip your lazy boy chair and launch into the second DVD which contains more great tunes and two bonus songs, \\"If Heartaches Were Nickels\\" and \\"Woke Up Dreaming.\\" Bonus footage on the DVD includes Joe and David Crosby together with David wowing Joe with an acoustic guitar session. Great back stage pictures, photos, and back stage footage.<br /><br />Guests include Beth Hart, The Paul Rogers and John Hiatt along with his formidable bandmates Carmine Rojas, Tal Bergman, and Rick Melick.<br /><br />\\"Beth Hart joins Bonamassa on stage for soulful duets on I'll Take Care of You and Sinner's Prayer, which is featured on the recently released Don't Explain - an album of soul covers Hart recorded with Bonamassa.\\" She has such a smoky sensuous style that keeps you gripping tightly on your seat.<br /><br />\\"John Hiatt, a Nashville Music Lifetime Achievement Award recipient and American Music Award (AMA) winner, joins Bonamassa for a rendition of Down Around My Place and I Know A Place.\\" John's near perfect performance highlights the amazing guitar work playing along side.<br /><br />\\"As legendary classic rock singer Paul Rodgers (Bad Company, Free) hits the stage, the audience jumped to its feet as Bonamassa performed Fire And Water and Walk In My Shadows.\\" Two classic frontmen, and distinct voices presenting flawless blues rock at its finest.

B006CBSE86|4.0|Admittedly, Imaginaerum is not as good as Dark Passion Play, or even Once, but I really like a couple songs, Ghost River and Scaretale, even better than any on DPP. Both songs are different from anything Nightwish has done and are quite good. In addition the rest of the album is very listenable

B0098VYCCE|2.0|Look, I get it. Everyone wants to do a \\"New Vision\\" of a classic tale. I tend to cut stories like these a lot of slack, because imagination should be rewarded, and often is rewarding to experience. Not in this case, though.<br /><br />The best that can be said for this movie is that I don't feel like I wasted my time having watched it. It was mildly entertaining... every once in awhile. The main problem I had was that the story takes very broad strokes and seems to centralize on explaining plot points that do little to enrich the viewers experience and do almost nothing with the points that would have added depth to the tale. It also had at least an hour of film that rightly should have been excluded since it did nothing but bog the story down.<br /><br />However, the weakness in the story could have been salvaged if Kristen Stewart hadn't been cast in the lead. Now, don't get me wrong: I think she's a wonderful actress. She put on a VERY good performance in \\"Adventureland\\". Granted, the movie really kinda sucked, but her role was very convincingly played, and she gets credit in my book for that. However, Kristen needs to play to her strengths... which, ironically, is her ability to portray a vulnerable and weak character. Hated \\"Twilight\\" and the franchise it spawned, but after having read the first book, I have to hand it to her: She played the part exceedingly well. Charlize Theron can portray the full gamut, from ultra strong to pityingly weak, but Kristen either doesn't have the chops or hasn't tapped into that part of her personality in order to give a convincing performance. The Snow White in this movie needed to run the range along with Theron, and Kristen was not up to the task, and the movie suffered as a result.<br /><br />I debated on giving it 1 star instead of 2, and in the end I decided that 2 stars was more fair. It was a decent attempt, and the other performances, while not Oscar worthy, were at least par for the course (Except Sam Spruell: That dude should never be given more than two lines in ANY movie, and no line over 5 syllables). The storytelling was meandering even at the best of times, and no one seemed to really WANT to be there, but the cinematography was very well done, a few new elements to the classic tale were well received, and while this is not going to be on my Christmas bluray list, I can appriciate the movie for what it truly is: A fair attempt at an original vision of a classic tale.
B0090EIC3Y|4.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Yes, it is rude, crude, and often incredibly un-PC.  If you are easily offended, save yourself the trouble and skip this one. If you enjoy ribald humour and razor-sharp wit, this is a must-see.

I very much enjoyed the characters and  I have to say I quite enjoyed the steamy scenes Eva & Gideon shared.  I enjoyed the storyline & writing. I hate to say that I did prefer this a little bit more than 50SOG. I'm not going to compare the characters or the storyline<br />between the to (that would be pointless & tiresome) . The bottom line I enjoyed the 50SOG series & now I'm enjoying the Crossfire series!! I just pre-orderd the second installment . I hope everyone is enjoying it as much as I have been!<br />Thanx!!

B008N5UX9M|3.0|The First problem I have with this album is the sound & mix of some of the tracks, which is pretty poor, didn't anybody involved with project bother to listen to one of the finished CDs.<br />Next you have the undisguised & weak vocals, I know Taylor has big shoes to fill, but still there're a little disappointing.<br />Then comes the music, which seems to come straight from the nineteen eighties.  There not bad songs  (the 80's was when I started buying rock LPs), it's just than there was no financial constrictions or record company pressure in the making of this record, so Harris could have created something ambitious & original (just because it's a rock album, doesn't mean your not allowed break the mode)<br />What would have been nice, if every song had a different vocalist, musicians & ever producer, to create a richly textured album, almost like a heavy metal version of \\"Screamadelica\\".<br />I think if the band toured the songs for 6 months before recording it, the album may have evolved a little.<br />I know you can say that this just Harris letting his hair down & having some fun with his friends, but you still have to pay full price for the album.<br />So unfortunately I would file this under \\"disappointing side project\\".

B001HNE3NO|5.0|Sarah's Key, wow. What an awesome story. The author takes us from the Nazi occupation of France in 1942 up to the current day. I could feel the despair and heartache of the Jews uprooted from their homes in '42 and the modern day, horrible realization of what occurred at that time; circumstances that change lives forever. The author's style is riveting. Loved this book.

B008QDCZJ2|5.0|Well, it did take a few listens for Elysium to sink in because it's so very subtle and you will appreciate the musical nuances when the world is a lot quieter. I think Elysium really showcases the Boys' musical maturity.<br /><br />My absolute faves are Winner, A Face Like That (quintessential Pet Shop Boys!). Give It A Go and Breathing Space are truly gorgeous. Slower numbers like Invisible is quite unlike the Boys as it departs from the formula. Took some time to get used to but after that I'm hooked! Everything Means Something sounds like Depeche Mode given a PSBs remix. Requiem In Denim And Leopardskin kind of reminded me of Saturday Night Forever from Bilingual. Hold On seems to be a mellower version of Go West that takes on A Red Letter Day (original album version).<br /><br />Ego Music with its sarcastic biting wit is really LOL while Your Early Stuff makes a case for self parody.<br /><br />On the whole, Elysium is not a pop daney album like Please, Yes or Very but is more experimental and I think the closest comparison is Release.<br /><br />If there's one 'flaw', Elysium comes across as curiously disjointed. The songs are great individually but do not necessarily segue well into one another to form a cohesive whole. Bilingual gave me the same vibe on first listen.<br /><br />I can't really explain it but I loved the instrumental disc right away. Let's use an analogy. It's like floating on the ocean with its gentle rippling waves, basking in the late afternoon sun with bits of sparkling light caressing your boday. A very sensual, relaxing experience.
1409303187|5.0|My 1 year old and I give two thumbs up for this item! The board books are small, about as small as the palm of an adult hand, but perfect for the hands of a toddler which really is what matters to me. The stories are only 3-4 pages long and straight to the point, and again long enough for the attention of a toddler. Like any board book if your little one is a chewer than your books will be like mine and look chewed up on the sides. The item is great for the price and I got a deal on mine with free shipping. I'm very happy with this purchase and def would recommend this item and everything with Peppa Pig to anyone.
B00571F26Y|1.0|The author begins with a very reasonable theory on the harmful effects of wheat due to changes from thousands of years of cultivation and genetic engineering.  Soon you are mired in an endless mumbo jumbo of chemicals and hormones (seriously most of the book). Maybe chem geeks would enjoy it but I did not. It ends up with nutritional advice that's basically the low glycemic index thing (not new to me).  He advises avoiding all grains except for flax seed, and eating mostly meat, egg, cheese, veggies and nuts. (If you buy his grain change theory it doesn't make sense that milk, cheese and eggs are safe because guess what those animals are eating?)  This book may be helpful to people who are suffering terrible and extreme health issues but too extreme for average old me.
B009B51K9U|4.0|I was really set to give this album 5 stars, but two things persuaded me otherwise.  First, beware that Amazon messed up this release a bit by pushing a $5 offer and not labeling it \\"clean\\".  I now see that there is an \\"explicit\\" version, but since that is the pure, unedited version, it's really the EDITED version that needs to be labeled as such, so that the listeners know they're getting the work as the artist intended it.  I'm 31 years old - I can hear some bad words, it will be okay.<br /><br />Second, I have to object to the general approach of Green Day releasing THREE full-length albums within the span of a few months.  While \\"Uno\\" isn't outrageously short by any means (about 41 minutes), there's really no need to do that to your consumers.  I suppose if the quality of the albums is good enough, people won't mind.  (For example, System of a Down did this with Mesmerize/Hypnotize and I loved both of those albums).  While many people will find the album on sale anyway, you're still asking for a lot from your fans compared to if you had just done a single 20-song album (like \\"21st Century Breakdown\\"), or maybe a double-album with 20-30 songs you could have charged $15 for.<br /><br />Anyway, as for the music itself, the band still sounds good.  It's incredible to think how far this band has come given that Dookie came out at a time when Kurt Cobain ruled the music world (and was still alive).  They've survived grunge, TRL, boy bands, number bands, emo, the emergence of \\"mainstream indie\\", and electronic music...and they've never really changed their formula of high-energy overdriven guitars and clever lyrics.  While most people view \\"American Idiot\\" as a sort of \\"comeback\\" for Green Day, the truth is that they've never really made a bad album.  You'll get your money's worth with \\"Uno\\", too, I just don't think they need to get our money three times in a row.

B00005JMAH|4.0|Ok, so if you haven't guessed by now I've been having myself a little mini marathon of Harry Potter's the past week.  In fact, it's been the perfect way to de-stress after a long day at work.  The Prisoner of Azkaban as the third movie in the series (and books) and if you haven't seen the other two, you need to go back and start at the beginning.  It just isn't the same if you don't.<br /><br />Harry is back at Hogwarts again after running away from his aunt and uncle's home (yet again, why do they keep letting him come back?).  Having blown up his aunt like a balloon with a spell, he fears the worst when the Ministry of Magic finds him.  But instead, they just want to keep him safe without an explanation.  He later learns that Sirius Black, a deranged prisoner from the wizard prison of Azkaban has escaped and is known to want to kill him.  To make matters worse, he finds out more secrets about Black that make him feel more wretched than before.  Even school isn't the same with Dementors (Azkaban guards) flying about and wreaking havoc.  It would seem a normal school year is not in the cards for Harry.<br /><br />Characters:<br />Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter<br />Rupert Grint: Ronald Weasley<br />Emma Watson: Hermione Granger<br />Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid<br />Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore<br />Gary Oldman: Sirius Black<br />Alan Rickman: Severus Snape<br />David Thewlis: Remus Lupin<br /><br />As usual, Radcliffe, Grint and Watson all work together extremely well on the set.  And it's so nice to see them grow up together just as they did in the books.  They have the right balance of comedy and adventure and complement each other well.  I thought Gambon as Dumbledore did an ok job.  He was neither better nor worse than his predecessor who regrettably died before the rest of the films could be made.  I think I'm more eager to see how he does when Dumbledore gets a larger role in the movies and more screen time.  I didn't really like Oldman as Sirius Black, maybe I just didn't see enough of him, but he seemed more manic than he was in the books.  Rickman as Snape was delightfully wicked as normal and there's just something about him that makes me root for him to appear more.  Thewlis, who I'm used to seeing in the bad guy role, was a nice change for Lupin where I finally got to see him as a character I could cheer on.<br /><br />The plot followed the books moderately well.  I do think that there were a lot more deviations in this one than the other two movies, but still, the important stuff was there.  But it also felt a little rushed.  Compared to the other two movies it didn't seem like there were any deep and poignant scenes in this one, or if there were they weren't given enough time to develop properly.  The detail was a bit less in this one too.  We barely get a look at Honeydukes or some of the other places in town and it could have really expounded on that and some other wizarding details that I love to see.  It would have made the whole story come alive.<br /><br />The special effects were a bit less in this one too.  Don't get me wrong, they were still good, but some of them definitely looked a little fake, especially in scenes towards the end.  I guess I'm just used to better quality for the Harry Potter movies.  Thankfully, the music was still terrific, mostly instrumental, but there was one song in the beginning sung by a choir that I really enjoyed.  And it was clever in its use of lyrics.<br /><br />Not a bad movie, but not the best of the Harry Potter lot.  I will eagerly move on to the next.<br /><br />Review by M.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first book, liked the second and loathed the third. I did read the reviews first but I always give a book a try no matter what. I just can't believe I even made it to the end of this book. There were so many loose ends that never were tied together which would make a reader at the end scratch their heads wondering what happened or flip back through the already read pages wondering if there was something they missed. It's like the author was so over writing that she left her imagination in the last two books and just went for it on this book. There were so many things that could have made this book so much better,  its very sad it had to end the way it did.
B009CPRYG2|4.0|Dc has been making animated films for a few years now. It was inevitable that they make the book that started it all - the new trend in comic books. Dark and gritty truly did start with \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.\\" The question is, though, how closely will they follow the source material?<br />I will affirm that they did very closely.<br />Of course there are a few bits of \\"artisitc embellishment\\" and some bits of dialogue added or changed in this version. That's to be expected because the graphic novel was a lot coarser in the language department, and some of the violence was quite a bit harder than audiences today could handle.<br />If folks have read the book, this first film folllows the first two issues - both one shot stories leading into the next which, in turn, lead into the epic parts 3 and 4. Epic is allowable in this case.<br />Without giving away much of the story which needs to be watched and not described:<br />Part one - Harvey Dent has been released, completely cured and pretty thanks to modern medicine. Bruce Wayne is fighting regret and boredom with crazy, near-suicidal stunts. Crime is at an all-time high. What is a 50's-plus former superhero to do? Return to the old ways - beat the crap out of bad guys and get the the root of the problem. That he does. With a vengeance.<br />Next is the whole mutant MAIN storyline that makes up part two. They are the problems. Batman does what he does best. Dark and sinister vs. the wild and insane. The mutants rule Gotham and citizens live in fear. After taking down Two-Face, the Mutants are now in the Batman's crosshairs. Not a good place to be in, trust me.<br />The story as a whole fits the original work of Frank Miller, Klaus Janson, and Lynn Varley as if they had a direct hand in the animated version. The animation is crisp and matches the books panel for panel. Splash page art from the books IS used in the movie, but are very brief shots so catching it is almost like subliminal advertising, you see it and recognise it, so it's there, just blink and you've missed it. Thank goodness for freeze framing.<br />The voice casting I will say is NOT stellar. Jim Gordon's character doesn't have that \\"seasoned\\" feel to his voice. He sounds too young nd spry for a man whose seen more than his share of depravity and crime by dedicating his life to fighting said crime. The character felt rather flat and lifeless. Same for Alfred Pennyworth, the famed butler and confidante to Bruce Wayne. His lines were excellent and added a lightness to the story, but again, he didn't sound his age.<br />On the plus side, Batman, Carrie Kelly, Capt. Yindell, and a few others more than made up the one-dimensional portrayals of other characters. So the balance was there, even though some more work was needed here.<br />Now my favorite part of any film, the score. When first watching the menu screen, the music here gave that feel of \\"Hold on to your seat, it's going to get wild.\\" feel. It has a very, for lack of a better term, \\"blockbuster film\\" feel to it. It held a grand scale ambiance with overtones of \\"it's in the dark and it's going to get you if you're naughty.\\" Seriously, it's that good.<br />This is one to get, boys and girls. While it holds the same feel and grit, it is a little toned down from the original work for the sake of getting a PG-13 rating. Don't wait, by all means, pick this up and see how DC revolutionised the comic book industry with \\"Batman: The Dark Knight Returns part One.\\"
B000002BPR|5.0|The Offspring's band name is a pointed reference to their origins as children of adult human beings. Likewise, their fans are united by a common trait of not remembering much of their first three years on earth. This bond is celebrated on \\"Ixnay on the Hombre,\\" where confusion sets in immediately over many obscure pig latin references. Unlike their \\"Crunch\\" counterparts in early 90's Seattle, The Offspring attempted to answer once and for all the question, \\"Sports or Music?\\" We can see the beginnings of the \\"Pretty Fly (for a White Guy)\\" era with several tracks featuring pauses where the listener can add their own \\"Uh huh, uh huh.\\" In the end, this album is a good stepping stone of discovery on the way to Fatbook and other post-spoken word bands. I give it 88 out of 100.
B00755MHXG|5.0|This book was wonderful! First I cried - really sobbing my heart out, but the whole book is not crying. There is laughing, sympathy, frustration and then a wonderful happy cry ending
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got to read a sample on my Kindle before purchasing and I couldn't wait to read the whole thing. Each part of the omnibus is a stand-alone story on its own but I don't think I would have wanted to miss any part of it. It is one of the best post-apocalyptic tales I have encountered. Hugh Howey is an engaging author who makes his characters people that you really care about. I have already recommended this book to my friends and I can't wait to dive into the prequel, First Shift-Legacy. Definitely a great read!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Omg! this game is amazing. I didn't think it would be this good. I love the explosions and collecting the stars and gold. This game is a must have. Worth the $99 cents.

I finally pulled to trigger on this bag before my July trip home. It is outstanding for keeping all your gear organized.<br /><br />The straps that people complain about are a bit thin... I am 6'3 and Weigh 180 and am in shape. I carried this guy for a few days for 4+ hours each time. It hurt a bit but... it was keeping all my stuff nice and neat so I did not / do not care!<br /><br />Putting on slip on Pads might work ?

B000P0J0G0|4.0|If you are a fan of Stephen Fry and/or Hugh Laurie, you will love seeing them together in their earlier & younger days; although I still think \\"Jeeves & Wooster\\" & the various \\"Blackadder\\" series are better in general, there is still something worth watching here in seeing Fry & Laurie evolve & grow & finding their footing as a comedy team through the various seasons.  The sketches themselves can be hit or miss overall,  but there are still a couple of real gems-- my favorite is a short but incredibly funny bit in the last season, in which Stephen Fry is chopping vegetables & attempting to make a salad while trying to pleasantly discuss his evening of going to the theater with the viewer-- I won't spoil the fun, but he gets unexpectedly & explosively angry out of the blue, then smoothly goes back & forth between the outbursts of anger & his more quiet & polite theater-talk mode.  This sketch is my favorite Stephen Fry bit of all time, outside of his \\"General Meltchett\\" harangues in \\"Blackadder IV\\" (and of course his incredibly loud & abusive Gen. Nelson in \\"Blackadder III\\", in which he got to slap Hugh Laurie around!). The last season is probably the best-- also love it when Hugh Laurie does his Python-esque \\"pepper-pot\\"-ish drag character,interfering with the man-on-the-street (or should I say, \\"woman\\"-on-the-street) interview with a pre-\\"Mrs. Stephen Fry\\" character (Fry's alter-ego on Twitter as his fictional beleaguered wife & inept mother of their fictional children-- see \\"Mrs. Stephen Fry's Diary\\", which was published in book form as a collection of his/\\"her\\" collected tweets! Very funny stuff!).  Recommended!

B004P1JEWU|4.0|The third book really picks up the pace with the reader treated to a dramatic evolution of the plot. I was stunned at how far the story progressed by the end of this book. I'm hampered by a personal belief that spoilers are the bane of the industry, so I won't go into any plot details. But fans of the series won't be disappointed by by this book - saddened, maybe, but not disappointed. Its the fact that everyone in the series (\\"good\\" or \\"bad\\") is at peril that makes it such a cracking read.<br /><br />Thanks, George!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great read and one heck of a tale. Writing style isn't gifted, but it is certainly readable and adequately structured.

1451648537|5.0|There must be more to our existence than meets the eye... Steve Jobs - an extraordinary biography by Walter Isaacson of one of the brightest stars of our times. Isaacson did an admirable job in exploring and exposing to the reader the demonic and mundane in his hero. With Dostoevsky's precision, he introduces and guides his reader through the nerves and veins of Jobs as a neglected orphan and rebelling west coast hippie of the 60s, follows the evolution of his champion into a ferocious entrepreneur and founder of Apple, acquaints Jobs as colleague and competitor, loving dad and abandoning father and finally, humbled by an incurable cancer Jobs - human being on the face of imminent tragic death. There is no better place than this book to learn as to how the preternatural drive of this innovator for novelty and his passion for perfection revolutionized several major industries of our times, which sculpture our thoughts of the present and shape profoundly our hopes of the future.

B004IK8Q86|4.0|I had not seen the 1940's movie version of this story until recently on TCM, which prompted me to purchase the book on Kindle and read it.  The written story is intriguing and was certainly helped by some of the character portrayals from the movie version.  Hollywood put the story in a chronological order, unlike Maugham did in the book.  Some of the pivotal activity of the book, i.e, situations to help understand the plot better, are reserved for the end, kind of putting it all together and into perspective.  The movie ruins some of the intrigue by placing things in time-line order.  Also, because it doesn't require the physical limitations of actors, the book allows for greater character development, especially with Isabel, Gray and Sophie.<br /><br />The story is one of self-discovery and I could see several people from my own life in the role of Laurence Darrell. I would have liked to have read the book first and then watched the movie, but it was still good the way I did it.
B008F5FWJ6|5.0|Clifford Curzon was one of the great pianists of the Twentieth Century. We owe a debt to Decca (OK, Universal) for bringing us this collection.<br />Curzon had a reputation as an intellectual (perhaps it was the glasses), but he could out-virtuoso the best of them (the Liszt Sonata is incredible).<br />Buy this box.<br /><br />That said, I was struck by something curious while reading the contents listing on the back of the box:<br />Clifford Curzon left us no recordings of a Beethoven Piano Sonata or of ANYTHING by Chopin.<br />He had possibly the most narrow recorded repertoire of any of the great pianists. His only rival in this respect was Arturo Beneditti Michelangeli.<br />Curzon was a pupil of Artur Schnabel. Perhaps that explains the lack of sympathy for Chopin, but the Beethoven is a mystery.<br />If anything, he could be called a Mozart specialist, but he only recorded five concertos, and he re-recorded them obsessively. He was never satisfied.<br /><br />Decca was justly famous for the quality of their stereo recordings (roughly half) and these do not disappoint.<br />Decca mono \\"ffrr\\" recordings were also famous in their time.<br />I have no quarrel with the piano sound, but always found the orchestral recordings a bit shrill compared to EMI or RCA.<br /><br />Now for some quibbles:<br /><br />1) The first 21 CDs in this box are already available in four collections, released between 2003 and 2007.<br />The DVD appeared in 2007 (it included a bonus CD - two BBC interviews with Curzon - CD 23 in the new box).<br />The only new material in this new box is on CD22 - 75 minutes recorded between 1942 and 1949.<br />$75 is a great price for 22 CDs and a DVD, but it is a lot to pay for one CD.<br />It would have been nice if Decca had released it as a single.<br /><br />CD22 really is indispensible.

That being said I still love my brothers in arms and will always be proud of them.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran's book reminded me why feminism isn't finished. I read it at a time when some things at work were bothering me, and I applied her suggestion of asking yourself, \\"is this happening to the men?\\" Oops, bingo. Now I realize what's going on, anyway.<br /><br />Besides the modern feminism reality check, her stories about growing up, becoming a writer, being young, etc etc are hilarious and, for me, sympathetic. Loved it, laughed out loud many times, quoted pieces to friends, and have recommended this book many times already.

B006OOHYIC|1.0|Just not my type of game.  It doesn't have a storyline and it is just this mind numbing sessions of bouncing a ball around.  The background is a bit dull and not very entertaining.
B0090EIILU|1.0|this movie was way over the top, disrespectful and a waste of time. I did not like it  at all
B004P7CNE0|4.0|This movie was a great deal. The movie itself is not the greatest but for the low price it was offered it was too good to pass up. It was cheap and shipped quickly and good quality disk. The fight scenes are a bit ridiculous but very entertaining. Highly recommend this movie to Christian Bale fans.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|I've seen better. Jack Reacher that fights terrorists, the Cia, sometimes the Fbi? A bit preposterous, isn't it, ever for my beloved hero. Maybe he needs a little rest and a better preparation

0425263908|3.0|I liked this book no matter how weird it was at tmes or even when the characters got so unrealistic. While it was no '50 Shades of grey' it still has potential, so I can't wait for the next one!

B008KMHFJY|5.0|Seriously loved this book!!! As I was reading it I kept thinking - this soooo needs to be made into a movie. Reminded me of Fight Club but waaaay better i.e all Brad Pitt and no Edward Norton. Travis doing Satisfaction on the cafeteria tables; on his knees begging her to love him....well I won't go there but, uhhhh....gut wrenching, emotional stuff. And we know he's a man whore but the whole banging two chicks thing - seriously you gotta admire a guy who even has the stamina...especially whilst drunk. And it was safe sex so... Okay Abby, didn't quite like her. Story is first person from her perspective but I don't know...was something missing. Maybe just because she was in such denial that it created a disconnect between what was so obviously developing between her and Travis and how she was divulging it. She was emotionally disconnected from her own feelings which made me emotionally disconnected from her. Just didn't have as strong a connection to her as I did with Travis even though he was only from her perspective. There was a scene where she was supposedly showing the competition what he saw in her and I was thinking.. yeah, actually, apart from the whole \\"I'm not easy like the rest\\" I don't quite get what he sees in her either. Meh, she grows on you and that's my only (minor) criticism. Otherwise loved, loved, loved this book. Seriously Travis is the ultimate bad boy yet redeemable hero - arrogant, cocky, total unapologetic male sl@t (but seriously they throw themselves at him so why wouldn't he?) but ultimately vulnerable and when he falls in love he FALLS IN LOVE. And when he calls her Pidge...uhhhh, my heart seriously melts. READ THIS, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED! Can't wait for the follow up book (already pre-ordered) and can't wait for the movie (if it happens). Hope the actors are unknowns though - not even going to speculate who might play them. As long as the actor who plays Travis is H.O.T hot. Also from a writing perspective really well written, good pacing and (reasonably) good editing. Only picked up a couple of really minor errors and considering the quality of some Kindle books (usually the self-published) in this genre, really high quality stuff.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is one of the few books that I absolutely loved everything about.  The story line flowed very well, there were no pauses in the action, the author explained things very well, and I truly loved this book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Absolutely the best you can get in battery saving tips, easy to read high definition battery level visuals, and is also very useful how it shows you all of the amounts of time left.

B0099G3I96|4.0|I'm a huge fan of No Doubt and I have been since almost the beginning...  I've been waiting for this album and I was so worried that after a 12 year absence they'd have lost their touch.  My worrying was for nothing as this album great, and in areas, awesome.  It has a magical combination that comes with her fantastic lyrics and their overall sound, with enough familiar elements to make their signature sound in a newer, fresher, more updated style.  I'm also thrilled that this album sounds closer to \\"Return of Saturn,\\" adding a heavy draw from the 80's style of instrumental synth-pop, than their Caribbean-influenced \\"Rocksteady\\" and that a lot of the urban elements that Gwen Stefani brought to her solo career have been abandoned, giving us a more \\"real\\" No Doubt sound.<br /><br />Their lead single, \\"Settle Down,\\" was a single that I didn't initially like, but it really grew on me, and actually isn't (for me at least) one of their best songs on the album.  \\"Stand and Deliver,\\" the title track, is fresh and unique sounding, something that really stands out for them as a band, and in the pop music genre as a whole (because, like it or not, that appears where No Doubt's legacy will land).  Other stand-out songs, for me at least, include \\"Gravity,\\" a very synth-pop 80's style song, \\"Undercover,\\" another very lyric-heavy 80's style synth-heavy song, \\"Sparkle,\\" which sounds like it's a forgotten track off of \\"Tragic Kingdom,\\" and the fairly radio-friendly \\"Dreaming the Same Dream.\\"<br /><br />I'm fairly disappointed that \\"Stand and Deliver,\\" a long promised single that was supposed to be on this album (they even toured playing this remake, saying it's be on the new album) is actually not on the album at all.  A wonderful and fun, it would have fit perfectly, and I'm bummed out it didn't make the cut.<br /><br />This album does have some flaws...  There seem to be many more slower, ballad-style songs then in previous albums, and the over use of the synth sound on some songs threaten to wash away the sounds and influences of Gwen's equally-musically capable bandmates.  It's always hard to know if the overall sound, which I think is deeply rooted in the new wave style of 80's music, will be a draw or a turn off to modern ears.  I suspect that those who love the classic No Doubt sound tinged with the retro will love it, while newer audiences may not get the influences or find it to sound \\"dated.\\"  Admittedly, the sound works better with some songs than others, and in the versions of the CD that include the acoustic versions of a few of the songs, I'm left to wonder if the album would have been better served done in a way more rooted in No Doubt's ska background.  Regardless of how the sound is interpreted, there is no arguing that, yet again, Gwen Stefani has poured herself into some pretty powerful lyrics that are both easy to relate to and, at times, somewhat heartbreaking as, again, songs about heartbreak and disappointment in love dominate the album.<br /><br />In the end, while it's not my favorite or the best No Doubt album, there are enough standout songs to make this album worth owning.  After a 12 year hiatus, I don't know if it quite lived to the hype of a return/comeback album, but it is certainly a breath of fresh air to the current music scene and it's great to have them back...  And I hope with less of a gap between this and their next album as there was between the last album and this one.threaten to wash away the sounds and influences of Gwen's equally-musically capable bandmates.

B000OLRH10|3.0|This was a good movie, however I personally found all the graphic violence<br />to be over the top and definitely excessive.  The story itself was good<br />and interesting, acting wonderful.  Think about the lives that are being<br />destroyed when you need that \\"Bling\\".
B000FA5TTW|5.0|When a book kicks you in the gut, knocking the air from your lungs, then extends its hand to help you up and cocoons you in a perfectly imperfect heaven, it's a part of you forever. Like it or not, it's indelible. There are parts of this book I wish I could purge from my memory. The cold, callous, brutal parts. Unfortunately, they are necessary to showcase the beauty. And there is beauty. Breathtaking, exquisite beauty in abundance. Poetic justice, too.<br /><br />The gore and violence are not graphic, which just goes to show that such depictions are not necessary to tell a powerful story or evoke a visceral reaction. The sexual assault aspects are quite understated. That does not diminish in the least their absolutely chilling impact. The existence of a predator in one's midst, living with impunity and inflicting such horror, is enough to terrify anyone.<br /><br />And yet, in the midst of all this horrifying activity, Susie's heaven is everything I ever imagined heaven to be. Idealistic yet tinged with the sadness of unfinished business and the frustration of being unable to ease the suffering of loved ones left behind. An afterlife that is both foreign and familiar, uplifting and achingly empty.<br /><br />I dreaded the movie (which was extremely well done, by the way), but I absolutely had to see it. I knew exactly where to look away lest the already-haunting images gained more mental real estate. The casting was brilliant, the direction superb, and the acting incredible. Read the book first, though. It will enhance your appreciation for the film.<br /><br />My beautiful daughter is fourteen now and oblivious to her mortality. That thought, in conjunction with this book, brings tears to my eyes and fills me with fear. Even so, this is one collection of words I wouldn't want anyone to miss.<br /><br />Mia House for Glass House Reviews<br />(c) 2012 Glass House Reviews
B008NW67E0|5.0|Mumford and Sons' debut album \\"Sigh No More\\" (2009 release) is one of those rare albums that comes out under the radar and then for some unknown reason, catches fire and slowly but surely keeps building, based on its incredible quality, word of mouth, and of course relentless touring by the band. By the time the band won several Grammys (and gave an unforgettable live performance with Bob Dylan at those Grammy Awards ceremony) in February 2011,, everyone wanted to get a piece of this UK band. Now comes the band's second album, and that it is highly anticipated, would be the understatement of the year.<br /><br />\\"Babel\\" (12 tracks; plus 3 tracks on the \\"deluxe edition\\"; 64 min.) starts off with an immediately classic sounding title track, in which the band explodes with vigor, bringing us all of the sounds that we have come to love, including of course the banjo. The subsequent several tracks are all in the same vein, just great. At track 5 \\"Ghosts That We Knew\\", we get the first more pensive track, with great lyrics like \\"So give me hope in the darkness that I will see the light/Oh they gave me such a fright/But I will hold on with all of my might/Just promise me we'll be alright\\", wow. The second half of the album brings a mix of up-tempo and slower songs, and it's hard to point out highlights as such, as this album plays like a whole, rather than just separate songs. On the last track of the album \\"Not With Haste\\", Marcus Mumford again is in a contemplative mood, crooning, as the album ends \\"Do not let my fickle flesh go to waste/As it helps my heart and soul in its place/And I will love with urgency/But not with haste\\", what a beautiful way to close the album.<br /><br />The deluxe edition comes with 3 extra tracks, all of them worth getting: \\"For Those Below\\", Where Are You Now\\" and sandwiched in between those a cover of Simon & Garfunkel's \\"The Boxer\\", in a way I'm quite sure you've never heard that song before, no bombastic outro here!. Interestingly, in the liner notes, it credits Paul Simon as one of the musicians on the track, but I couldn't tell from listening (he surely is not on vocals, so probably on acoustic guitar). All that aside, \\"Babel\\" is a fantastic album, let there be no doubt about it, no sophomore slump for these guys! And for a few extra bucks, the \\"deluxe\\" edition is definitely the one to get. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!liner notes, it credits Paul Simon as one of the musicians on the track, but I couldn't tell from listening (he surely is not on vocals, so probably on acoustic guitar).

0061537969|1.0|I found this book entirely too sad from the beginning to the end.  The only time that poor dog was happy was when he was watching racing on T.V.  That's just sad.  I have to wonder if the author even knows about dogs and how they act, because I was truly disappointed in this story.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|With a list of glowing (often gushing) reviews as long as your arm, this book has absolutely no need for mine. I don't care.<br /><br />If you know anyone with a diagnosis along the autism spectrum, you know that they are fascinating and frustrating individuals with a variety of social challenges, not least of which is being viewed as having sub-par intelligence. I know several people with this label, and I find them genuine, delightful, and without guile. That's a refreshing change from most people. Until I read this book, however, I'd never even attempted to put myself in their shoes (so to speak).<br /><br />There are plenty of people who hated this book as evidenced by its mixed reviews. I don't know whether they lack empathy or if the immersion into the mind of a child with autism was just too unsettling to allow them to absorb the significance of story. In my opinion, they've lost an opportunity to increase their depth of understanding about a complicated condition that is impacting a growing number.<br /><br />This book is quirky, disturbing, enlightening, uplifting, and intriguing. Its writing style is straight-forward and simplistic, as befits its narrating character. As such, it's a quick read.<br /><br />It's also sticky. No, not in a gross library book's boogers-in-the-margins way. I mean, it's one of those books that sticks to your mind. Turns of phrase, imagery, characters, and the emotion they evoke take up residence in your memory, and there they remain.<br /><br />I read this book years ago. I have undoubtedly forgotten specifics, but it still resonates and is one of the first books that pops to mind when someone asks for a recommendation. I may read it again someday. Then again, I rather like its echoes just as they are.<br /><br />I highly recommend you read it! Then, by all means, stop back to share your thoughts.<br /><br />Mia House for Glass House Reviews<br />(c) 2012 Glass House Reviews

B0010SKSTO|3.0|After reading dozens of reviews I was excited to make the purchase of this book, because with the authors credentials, I felt he would have a plethora of information to share on the topic of reading people. He also is from the area of FL that I grew up in and he is a professor at the University my sister graduated from so I wanted to support a local. I chose this book about reading body language because of the type of work I do, I wanted to gain a deeper understanding of how to read people's non-verbal behavior, instead I got a really good education about the authors' experience. There was very little information that was presented that was more than his monologue about his career. Sadly, I will be looking for another book on the subject to help me in my quest.

As the latter, it stands strong behind it's claims while revealing the beauty of nature with Dawkins' usual wit and charm in the process.

B009329ZF2|4.0|I think this is the lightest-weight big-budget special effects movie I've ever seen.  It has some wonderful, genuine sci-fi elements that are actually integral, but somehow feel like throw-aways anyway. Don't know how they did that. It has the plot sophistication of a 2-part TV miniseries, or maybe a better-than-average pilot. The women are allowed to come *so close* to breaking out of stereotype. The emotional appeals are *so* blatant, they could have subtitles.<br />The hero is *such* a pathetic jerk. When he has his epiphany you can almost hear the narrator. \\"Suddenly, Alex realized it was time. Time... to grow up. To show leadership, compassion, judgement, teamwork, intelligence, and planning. Things he had never done. But would now do. Big-time. Because people he had never really cared about, needed him to.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed it a lot late one evening. I would *never* watch it again - it would be like eating the same lime-flavored cotton-candy cone. Twice.<br /><br />And yes, Brooklyn Decker is very nice to look at (who knew) and yes, you might end up caring more about what happens to Rihanna than anybody else on-screen. I did.
B005LAII0S|5.0|I must admit, I liked the movie enough that I wanted to put it on my Galaxy 3 for watching while TAD, Unfortunately, the only two download options are either ITunes (Yuck...) or Android (Beta) which did not work to an Android phone, WTF...<br />Please make a link to download this to a Windows OS Laptop and I can convert it to Android so I can enjoy it on the road.

145162607X|3.0|It is important to understand first and foremost that although this book is a great adaptation of the already told \\"Cousins War\\" - offering a wonderfully different viewpoint...........it is the SAME STORY that Philippa Gregory has written 3 times now. This is not opinion - it is a FACT!<br /><br />The Cousins War books are the exact same story over and over: White Queen is told from the York point of view. Red Queen is told from the Lancaster point of view (and much more boring I assure you). The Lady Rivers is AGAIN the York point of view but with more background of the mother of the White Queen. And here - the Kingmakers Daughter, you get the same story AGAIN, but from a totally different point of view of 2 sisters who balance both sides of the war.<br /><br />It makes me sad that I couldn't truly enjoy the book from it's unique perspective of Warwick \\"The Kingmaker\\" and his 2 daughters. I enjoyed the extraneous scenes that involved the Warwick sisters, their suspicions, and their struggles. But for goodness sakes, I feel like I am taking crazy pills - does NO ONE notice that this woman has written the same book 4 ways now?!?! I anticipated every major plot point, as anyone who has read this \\"series\\" should - because nothing major really changes historically. You already know all the players and outcomes therefore the story is stale. I literally was reading it thinking, and this is the part where ___ happens.<br /><br />If someone was reading this book for the first time - then it is a well written take on the history of the War of the Roses. Maybe not the most compelling ending for a novel... but still an interesting story with love, betrayl, and divided loyalties. If you have read the others in the \\"series\\" - you are in for a major disappointment as there is no progression, and you already know 80% of the whole book. I took the \\"continuation\\" notion seriously and got the book without even reading the sleeve... that ought to teach me!<br /><br />My note to Philippa Gregory and her fans: When there is a saga, or a \\"continuation\\" there should be progression of story. Heck - if it was a full prequel, that would still be a warm welcome to this broken record called a series. But this storyline does not progress or offer us any more knowledge than we already have about the same time frame, same players, same history.<br /><br />It is not a series, it is a repeater.... just with different eyes. First book was great. Second book was a snooze, overly-religious, retelling of the same story - you got me. Third book, a throwback of the 1st book? I was getting bored and felt bamboozled. Fourth book (this one), I am an idiot for even reading it without checking the book sleeve.<br /><br />Such a shame, cause I bet first time readers of Kingmakers Daughter are running out to get the whole \\"series.\\" It's a good enough book - but the knowledge of this \\"series\\" being a bunch of repeaters, silences any applause I could give this 4th rendition.pa Gregory and her fans: When there is a saga, or a \\"continuation\\" there should be progression of story.

055380684X|5.0|I'll say it right away: Dan Coyle's book did much to inspire my quest to \\"crack the code\\" of writing. In fact, I named my own book and learning system [[ASIN:B004C445EC The Writing Code: The Only Comprehensive Guide To Writing Well in All Fields (The Writing Code Series)]]. My Coyle-inspired quest transformed my approach to writing -- and to teaching writing to people of all ages and backgrounds.<br /><br />Years ago, when Dan Coyle started work on \\"The Talent Code,\\" he called me looking for contacts with the baseball world of Curacao. I had just written [[ASIN:1402206615 Little League, Big Dreams]], which featured the Curacao team in the Little League World Series. He told me he was trying to figure out the secret of talent \\"hot spots,\\" and he was intrigued that such a tiny country could produce such talent. I didn;t really know what he was trying to do, but I was happy to help.<br /><br />When \\"The Talent Code\\" came out, it was just the book I was looking for. I had started teaching writing at Yale and SUNY-Purchase and I was working on a book about the 1963 March on Washington ([[ASIN:0807001554 Nobody Turn Me Around: A People's History of the 1963 March on Washington]] was published in 2010). I had embarked on my own quest to bring my own writing to a higher level and to help my students transform their writing. I read everything I could about learning and the brain. And I started to develop a number of simple tricks to help students to write better and faster.<br /><br />Then Dan Coyle's book came out. I was blown away by his clear, lucid description of \\"deep practice\\" and \\"myelenation.\\" These concepts supplied the missing elements of my own quest. The idea, in a nutshell, is this: We learn better when we break complex skills into their smallest parts, and then focus intensely on those pieces. As Coyle says, the old saying that \\"practice makes perfect\\" is not completely right. In truth, practicing the right way, with with total concentration -- and repeating simple actions, again and again -- is what makes the difference. So to master a skill like writing, we need to break it down, isolate each simple skill, and make each one interesting and usable. And we need to figure out a way to \\"burn\\" the skills into the brain.<br /><br />I brought that insight into my teaching and writing. What a difference it makes! Following the approach that Dan Coyle explains in this masterpiece, I found it much easier to apply -- and teach -- all of the essential skills of writing. With this system, almost anyone can master all the basic skills of writing in a fraction of the time you spend in school. And, as Dan Coyle suggests, it's fun. Because when you make progress, when you gain real mastery, you develop confidence and a desire to practice what you've learned.<br /><br />I hope this doesn't sound like a commercial. I just want to say how grateful I am for this book -- not just for me and my students, but for anyone who cares about learning. It's hard to imagine a more important book for education and the changing economy that depends so much on creativity.mple actions, again and again -- is what makes the difference.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game but requires real money. I remember oregon trail from when I was a 3rd grader. Oregon trail has come a long way.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book (to me) is a Harry Potter meets Games of Thrones type of setting. With a more realistic-type of magic, a school we would all love to get into (and try to stay in), families, tudor-ish time era, and just enough demons wandering around to not steal the show but keep you on your toes.<br /><br />Some points in the book are predictable. But, for the most part, the story and development of the characters kept me intrigued well beyond the ending of the book. I immediately purchased and downloaded book 2 when I was about 95% finished with this one so I could start on the second book seamlessly.<br /><br />Kvothe is a character you can fall in love with. He knows his strengths but seems to be humbled by them. He is also aware of where he comes from and how the world views him. He never oversteps his boundaries in terms of character limits (nothing ever too fake...but just enough dramatic appeal to keep me wanting to know what happens next.) He is also keen on marking his weaknesses but not allowing them to be a game changer in his life. I always felt like he had the ultimate goal in mind and never lost sight of it. There was not a time when he really gave up and that kept me liking him even more so. When he was down on his luck...there wasn't this, \\"oh woe is me...\\" moment. He grieved formidably within a reasonable time frame when necessary and then moved on. He is also independent which is my favorite characterstic. I feel like a lot of stories these days depend on two or three secondary main characters and hitch up with them throughout the book. This book doesn't seem to need the continued support of such a character.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book...and book two (I am already 91% finished and fully looking forward to the third).
B00005QHSS|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for this item to be at a low enough price to buy and it  finally happened! My item was poorly taken care of. The booklet was all stuck together and the CD had some songs that skipped, but it was still worth it. A rare item at a good price. The booklet has some photos in it not in the standard release. Well worth the money.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I was looking for a DVD that would replace a cross-fit type full body workout/weight lifting class I took pre-baby. Post-baby (2 years, I might add), I haven't done any real good weight lifting or serious classes for about 3 years, but I needed something to guide me, motivate me, and still be workable with working and taking care of a 2 year old).<br /><br />This does the cross fit type class on a much smaller level and basically breaks it up into 20 minute intervals. For a REAL workout, I could do all 3 at once. For a regular 20-minutes-in-the-morning-before-work-with-the-2-year-old-playing-at-my-feet workout, this hits most muscle groups hard and gives me strength and cardio enough to feel like I actually did something. (I'm working up to the hard core 60 minute workout!)<br /><br />For the serious, intense workout person that I was, this video was probably about the same as the exercise classes and still enough to do something that felt hardcore at home. For the less-in-shape busy mom in me, this is exactly what I needed: short, intense, working my muscles, building strength, and bringing me back to buff! Not overly strenuous, easily doable, but effective.

0385344333|3.0|I gave this three stars instead of two because the plot doesn't depend upon Reacher being an idiot.  So many plots hinge on the main character and all around good guy doing something utterly stupid and out of character, but that isn't the case here.<br /><br />Interesting start, wondered where it was going then about the time the local sheriff dropped out of the picture I didn't care what happened.<br /><br />The wrap up reads like a first novel.
B009329Y30|1.0|The writer is trying to make an issue between the main characters so that they have that perfect moment where she realized he is the most important. Give me a break. write some good movies and step out of the box of writing the same plot all the time.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Without going into my own graphic description I will say that I think book two was jus as intense as the 1st book.  It made for a great and easy read and hard to put down.  And towards the end of the book it picked up so much momentum a person could feel the intensity.  Great job to E.L.James on such a great series thus far.  I have just started the 3rd book and can't wait to see the outcome.

B0083SBMBM|4.0|Great movie 4 stars for that but the DVD retail version was a let down no deleted scenes! Why?<br />There is no reason not to have put them on the plain DVD disc. There is no reason you should have to buy the Blu ray version just to see the deleted scenes it no like there is not enough space on the DVD for them. Who cares about the directors commentary omit that and put the extended and deleted scenes on the DVD.<br /><br />Im sick and tired of Hollywood pushing 3D and Blu Ray.<br /><br />3D is a completely waste of effort, and Blu ray the clear the picture the more easier you can see the flaws!

B0012GMYTG|4.0|Cooper has confessed in his autobiography to having spent the early 80's drunk & moving through musical styles that didn't work for fans or him. In the late 80's, after a series of hard rock albums that slightly brought him back on course albeit with no chart hits, he deliberately teamed up with hit maker/songwriter Desmond Child to get back on the charts after a decade & become again the respected musical force he once was. Trash was a return to glory via heavily commercialized hard rock, a fresh image & a successful world tour featuring an array of future icons in his backing back (Al Pitrelli, Derek Sherinian, Jonathan Mover, Eric Singer). Albeit, Child is known for penning love ballads for Cher, Aeromith & Bon Jovi & didn't much change his style to suit Cooper's style. But, the album achieved its goal while establishing Cooper as a leather wearing hard rocker balladier still surrounded by his famous props.<br /><br />But, it's the follow-up Hey Stoopid, sans Child & an over-reliance on love songs but keeping everything else, that finally brought Cooper completely home. It didn't have the plethora hits that Trash spawned but that's more a reflection of changing MTV audiences than the number of future classics on the album. Back in full force is the tongue-in-cheek horror themes that had worked so well for Cooper but abandoned(i.e. \\"Might As Well Be On Mars\\" one of two remaining tracks with Child, \\"Feed My Frankenstein\\", \\"Snakebite\\" co-written with Kelly Keeling of Dokken & the Michael Shenker Group, \\"Burning Our Bed\\" co-written with Al Pitrelli, \\"Hurricane Years\\", \\"Hurricane Years\\", \\"Dirty Dreams\\", \\"Die For You\\" co-written with Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx & Mick Mars), while underneath humor was an array of emotive love ballads & cutting social commentary, the former taking a more prominent role in later albums particularly the Brutal Planet trilogy. The corny sounding title track was actually a cry against those wanting to committ suicide with \\"Hey, hey, hey stoopid, they win, you lose\\" ... though many may not realize that Cooper is more than shock rock but has opinions & a positive social message. Remaining on Hey Stoopid is also the commercial sheen that had glossed up Trash & really works for Cooper however much raw music is cherished over commericalization. Cooper doesn't cuss, have nudity or do anything horrid on stage like many of his imitators & anything but a non-commercial sound would fail. Though, gone forever is the experimental flavor of the 1970's Alice Cooper band, here confirmed with an array of guest hard rock guitarists to prove this is a new Cooper. Hey Stoopid would be the mold for everything that has come since. All the pieces are here that would get developed further, from the leather to the humor to the guest musicians, to memorable chorus lines. This is also one of the stronger releases with some of his most memorable songs, though this is firmly rooted in 80's hard rock while Cooper would later experiment with industrial (i.e. Brutal Planet) & power metal (i.e. The Last Temptation). The post-Trash Alice Cooper is a heavy metal vicious beast. The songs are fairly generic 80's metal but what sets them apart is Cooper's recognizable vocal style, catchy lyrics that are more mini-narratives & unpredictable musical arrangements. Cooper wants you to go to on an emotional ride with him & he does it very well with this release, oft forgotten but deserving a new listen.d, they win, you lose\\" ... though many may not realize that Cooper is more than shock rock but has opinions & a positive social message.

B0091XRL86|3.0|I guess Pixar has spoiled the world for me.  The vast majority of their films are clever, well-written, multi-layerd stories filled with surprising nuances - consider the whole opening sequence of Up, or the underlying themes of the Incredibles or the Toy Story series.  I did enjoy the Walace and Gromit films and Chicken Run, but this film seemed to lack whatever they had in common with their computer animated cousins.  It felt one dimensional and seemed to leer in your face like some of the poorer children's programing does, instead of the perhaps not too subtle wink at the camera the better cartoons have always had - from Bugs Bunny up through the Tick (animated) and beyond.<br /><br />It wasn't terrible ... it had some moments ... but just didn't do it for me in the end.
030758836X|4.0|The beginning starts predicably and you know you have it all figured out and THEN  it twists in an unexpected way and then twists again. Very entertaining and very clever although by the end it was almost too much. Definitely recommend reading it.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|The book started with a small bang, then dropped really quickly to a cruise along the highway. But from about 1 qtr of the way through, you could feel it build and build all the way to the massive finish.<br />Loved every minute of it.
B000002LSV|5.0|When I was a boy ZZ was like National Geographic where you looked at the pictures of naked Africaans when your mom was out of the room, but here it was listening to the band's raunchy songs & watching their videos with lusty ladies legs in full view (i.e. \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", \\"Tush\\", \\"Legs\\"). I felt safe when mom & I saw 'Back To The Future III' & ZZ played over the credits but with a safe song ... but I sat there knowing the truth about this band. When I got older I began to hear ZZ as a great rock band that made this killer & super recognizable fuzz-toned pulsing groove with only 3 musicians & a drum machine. Now, in my 30's, I see them as a greatly under-rated gritty blues-rock band (i.e. \\"Rough Boy\\") that took a decade off from playing what they were good at. This last view is probably closest to reality as they started as a raunchy Texas blues band that found MTV success by putting a rock sheen on their sound (for example \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\", \\"Pearl Necklace\\", \\"I'm Bad\\") ... the same approach as fellow blues guitarist George Thorogood. ZZ has two parts to their career - the 70's blues days, where they saw the most successful albums over all, & the 80's/90's, where their albums had a couple hits but were much weaker overall but the band found more commercial success. In the past decade the band has largely returned to their 70's blues sound but with the success of either decade. This greatest hits collection is probably the best starting point for the casual fan as it has the MTV staples, a few blues & some new songs with any missing bits being minor quibbles. As for what the band has produced since it was released that might be missing, ironically, \\"Doubleback\\" from Recycler & made popular via the 'Back To The Future III' soundtrack & included here was pretty much the last time they ZZ enjoyed the success of MTV. But, that's not saying what they've released since isn't any good. Some of their most wild playing blues would come with later releases that returned them to their roots, but there's no place for a band like this anymore on MTV & days of rigid blues-rock had done too much damage to bring the band any new highs. Maybe if they dueted with Kanye West or Eminem ... There's only a few weak tracks here(i.e. \\"My Head's In Mississippi\\", \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", \\"Sleeping Bag\\") which are a bit too robotic, as many critics have described their 80's blues-rock, but its a small speedbump.hem to their roots, but there's no place for a band like this anymore on MTV & days of rigid blues-rock had done too much damage to bring the band any new highs.

B009329ZF2|3.0|Not sure I like the \\"hot-head-kid makes good\\" type of story as much as I did before Hollywood beat it to death.  Another such movie was J J Abrams Star Trek.  Whether they don't allow enough story arc for the character to change, or maybe they see it as a new archtype and just expect audiences to know that when command is thrust upon them, these bad boys of course grow up (which, of course, they don't in real life).  Either way I wasn't buying the main character in this film .... or too many of the other primary characters for that matter.  Which is too bad cause the story premise and it's progression was fine, the special effects were fine, Rihanna was great for what little she was given ... but Liam Neeson was handed a cardboard cut out of a role and there wasn't much he could do with it, Taylor Kitsch, who did perfectly fine in the under rated John Carter of Mars film, didn't do much for me, and his girlfriend Sam and her double amputee patient could have been played by cardboard cut outs (Brooklyn Decker and Gregory D. Gadson in these roles .... I know Gregory Gadson is a vet and this is his first role, but my criticism falls here mostly on the director, Peter Berg, who should have worked some of the woodenness out of this performance before committing it to the movie).<br /><br />All in all, it didn't suck, but it could have been a lot better.
0385344333|3.0|I have read every Jack Reacher novel and loved them however this one is just disappointing. There is little physical action and it is hard to follow the twiss and turns and when it ends - you are huh? I will wait for the next and hope that Lee Child returns to writing as he has in the past.<br />Perhaps he is changing the character a bit and changing him from a big physical guy to a more introspective guy since the 6' + man is being played by Tom Cruise in the the Jack Reacher movie coming out - I mean come on. It is so disappointing when characters you love are portrayed in movies by someone not even remotely similar.

She said she wanted a Barbie house and I know she had in mind the town house or similar large residence, but there is a space problem in her house, so this seemed to be a reasonable alternative.  I hoped she would also think it was reasonable.  She loves the fact that she can keep all her Barbies and their equipment in it and carry it around with her.  A nice touch is that the lid also becomes a swimming pool.

030758836X|1.0|I have now read two of Ms. Flynn's novels, Dark Places and I just finished Gone Girl. Gone Girl labors on and on and on much as Dark Places did. It took over four months for me to finish this never ending tale of a sadistic marriage. I kept picking it back up having forgotten how boring and distasteful it was. I, like many other readers must be desperately in need of a good psychological thriller but surely this is not one. The meaningless ending made me think that I have read better short stories penned by high school kids.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Having read the trilogy of books before seeing Hunger Games, I had high hopes and personal concepts for the visual representation. This is always a precarious place to be, fraught with the danger of disappointment. I really fully enjoyed the movie and thought that necessary distillations of various scenes for the sake of time were well handled. The futility the population outside the city feels is nicely captured by the lighting and muted color used; and then the change of texture and sensation upon arrival in the Capitol is a glaring juxtaposition. The excesses of wealth and hardness alluding to those of ancient Rome can't be missed. Overall this movie sets up the sequels very solidly, and I look forward to seeing them.

1439127700|5.0|A book on politics affirming?  Yes, this one is affirming and it makes the reader appreciate our Presidents, those we love and those we hate, as human beings doing the best they can.<br /><br />Beneath the rhetoric, name calling, dirty tricks and deliberate misrepresentation that all too often charaterize Presidential elections, there is an abiding trust among the men who have held the office and a respect and commitment to the Presidency itself.<br /><br />This is that story. Newly elected Presidents don't change the office; the office changes them.  And it makes them more appreciative of their predecessors  the positions they took, the battles they fought, the ones they won and the ones they lost. Being President is a lonely job. And there are times when a President, no matter how powerful,must have someone to turn to, someone who understands.  Who better to turn to than those who have sat in the chair before?  This is an outstanding, truly outstanding, book on the men who have held the Office of President of the United States, their relationship with each other and their relationship with the sitting President. Truly fascinating.<br /><br />For example, the friendship, breakup and make up of Harry Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower; Kennedy calling on Ike after the Bay of Pigs and essentially saying \\"help\\"; LBJ's dependency on Eisenhower; Ford and Carter, bitter enemies who became close friends even the point of agreeing to do each other's eulogy and how that friendship came about on an airplane.<br /><br />Four relationships are especially striking: Bill Clinton reaching out to Gerald Ford as impeachment neared, and Ford's response.  And Nixon, the master of Dirty TTricks, whose most vile and evil dirty trick was not Watergate, but deliberately undermining a peace settlement in Vietnam weeks before the 1968 election so he could win the Presidency.  How many American and Vietmamese died because of his selfishness and hunger for power? And Nixon, again, always a perceptive observer and player in international politics becoming Clinton's most trusted advisor on Foreign Policy.When Nixon died, Clinton said, \\"I haven't felt this way since my mother died....\\"<br /><br />And how Clinton, after scarring campaign against George H.W. Bush in 1992, became an honorary member of the Bush family, \\"a brother from another mother\\" as the Bush brothers said, one even going so far as to call him \\"Bro\\" as in brother.  And meaning it...<br /><br />Good stuff all.<br /><br />One thing is especially evident throughout the book: With few exceptions all of these former Presidents put the good of the country first, ahead of politics, party and personal considerations.  Maybe there is hope for us all. Maybe there is hope for the country if men could be Presidents and not politicians.<br /><br />Good book. Don't miss it.

0439023513|2.0|I was very upset at how Collins rushed through the important scene's.<br /><br />SPOIERRRRRRRR<br /><br />I miss that emotion . When Prim died, where was it? Finnick? Nothing?? I wanted the feeling that drove me through the first two books. Like when Rue died, when Gale was whipped. Where is the drive in Katniss? I get that she is supposed to be depressed and I know that that is what war does but, it could have been written in a way that wasn't so rushed. Thoroughly disappointed.<br /><br />The one thing I did like was the feeling Collins left at the end. Proof that she still has potential. I feel empty, and a bit depressed myself (as Katniss was). It's a tough feeling to end on, but I wasn't expecting a happy ending.
B0083GPDBO|1.0|I am a SiFi fan to say the least. I own over 500 DVDs 80% are SiFI.<br />In my opinio this movie was awsome. Fantastic ending.
030758836X|2.0|I hate when this happens. You start a book and it seems really good (with capital R) and so you tell people to get it, THEN as the story goes on it turns into a whole load of stupid codswallop. What an absurd ending.
B008Y78M60|5.0|This movie was so well done.  This movie tells a complex story with amazing insight and is a good lesson for what happens when the government decides revenge is more important than the law, loved the ending.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|great game! this keeps my daughter occupied on long car rides and my nephew loves it too. would like it to be a little easier to win the puzzle pieces though
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I am glad that I read the book before I looked at the reviews. A lot of these reviews are very harsh and negative. The purpose of writing is a review is to voice a little opinion on the book but don't force someone not to read it!<br /><br />I thought, the relationship between Abby and Travis was pretty realistic in the way that a girl would get involved with a \\"bad boy\\". At first, she sees him the way every one else sees him. A player. They begin a friendship that everyone is in awe of because Travis doesn't have friends who are girls. He sleeps with everyone he lays eyes on, except.... when he meets Abby. The first girl who doesn't give him the time of day.<br /><br />The more they learn about each other the more obvious it becomes to everyone around them that they should be together. They make each other different. In good ways. For the better. Abby is constantly battling with her heart, running away from him but not being able to stay away from him. She finds out, from his father why he never let a woman in before. And it hits home with Abby. It all makes sense. You would think at this point, happily ever after? Not yet! It keeps you sucked in until the very last page!<br /><br />Everyone including me, likes the fairy tale ending, and the perfect relationships and romances. But that doesn't mean this book needs to get negative reviews because it wasn't a fairy tale. I appreciate that she didn't make it so fake, because for some of us we are able to relate. Not to the whole thing but certain parts. For me, it's being cautious as she was when she met him. Protecting my heart from men who I know are bad from the beginning. Well, she is unable to keep herself from falling for him.... which is how I was in my younger days. And I'm sure there are a lot of us out there who can say the same thing.<br /><br />Give this book a chance. You will get attached to the characters and find yourself fighting for them to stay together throughout the whole book! It's worth it. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this gameand truthfully I gotit because it was free.now its got me laughing out loud and yelling. lol its a blast!!!
B005HSL626|1.0|its a fun game but it quits on its on every time I try to play it. It litteraly closes every songle time. if it would work I would play it all the time.  I would never recommend anyone paying for this game. it would be a big waste of money.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because this book has so many issues in it that it is very likely that everyone can relate to something in this book. I really enjoyed reading it and couldn't put it down.
0345803485|5.0|When I first started reading I was a little bored, but I kept reading because 60 pages into this \\"sexual\\" book I still had not hit a sex scene and I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. The first book is written a little poorly, but I really enjoyed it all the same. The sex scenes are a little unrealistic, but completely hot, and the writing gets better and better as you keep reading. There is a sex scene about every 3-4 pages AWESOME. I haven't been able to not put down a book since Harry Potter, but I had to read all three books straight through! I may read them a second time. LOVED IT.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I first saw the game, I thought this is probably a simple little game, but I decided to get it anyway - This is absolutely fantastic, it starts out easy but it does get harder and harder - whoever came up with this game - thank you it is awesome....

B002I0J5FG|5.0|I really love Team ICO and I was optimistic about this release just for the bonus material and the excuse to replay both games. I was aware it was remastered but I wasn't getting my hopes up about it visually since I typically don't notice the difference when media is given an HD upgrade. In this case it was definitely noticeable. The visuals, especially in Shadow of The Colossus, are even more breathtaking.<br /><br />It's easy to see the amount of work and care Team ICO puts into their games. They even made the menu to switch between the games hauntingly beautiful and meditative. ICO is an excellent platform puzzle solver way ahead of its time. Shadow of The Colossus defies definition in terms of simple genre. The story that links the two games has all the properties of iconic myth. I can't wait for the release of The Last Guardian to finish up the trilogy.
B008GM1FPI|5.0|There really seems to be no middle ground on this movie. Very few people \\"sort of\\" like it or \\"could go either way\\" on it. I love it enough that I've shown it to a lot of my friends. Many, I might even say a majority, just couldn't get into it. It moves slowly at times, and it has very little in the way of a linear plot progression. It's more like a constellation that gradually forms one star at a time, and even the final result is open to interpretation. If you feel like exploring unknown mental territory, and don't have a particular need to conclude your wanderings with a sense of defined achievement or arrival, this is your flick.<br /><br />If you're generally impatient with philosophical ramblings and find yourself often wishing some people would grow up, get a stable job, and become productive members of society, you won't make it through this film. The entire thing is an oddyssey where the steps - forward, back and sideways, at times - are the only destination. I'm not saying that a goal-oriented professional can't enjoy the mindset of this film, because I'm one myself, but you have to be interested in shutting off that side of yourself to an extent, which is what I like to do for at least some of the time when I'm not working.<br /><br />Waking Life is full of little surprises, and I like to go back and watch it again every now and then, just to remind myself how many different ways there are of seeing the world. If you're interested, I highly recommend it.

B001B3MCQK|5.0|I saw the movie \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" and enjoyed it very much.  So I downloaded this \\"album\\" as mp3's, and am very impressed with this guy's work.  All the songs on the album are interesting and meaningful.  It is easy to understand how he became such a big hit in some countries, hard to understand how it didn't happen here.<br /><br />My personal favorite songs on this album are \\"Forget it\\" and \\"I Wonder\\".  Of course, they are catchy and easy to like.
B001FEA9QU|5.0|I skipped buying three straight Metallica albums before this one, though each had its gems. Someone sent me an MP3 of Cyanide before the album came out, I knew I was buying it before I even had a chance to hear the rest. I respect the band's right to explore new and old sonic territory, and unfortunately that took them places that didn't really float my boat when they made Load, Reload and St. Anger. As of Death Magnetic, I am back to unqualified two-thumbs-up status with these guys. GO METALLICA.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great look at Special Operations from a true professional.  Good that it is the eye witness account that debunks the Administration story.  Good writer.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|I find the book utterly mediocre and monotonous, lacking in literary resources and imagination. We all know by now how Mr. Grays smells and what kind of stallion he is, but nothing about Ana, her real self and the  the conflict she must have lived is very poorly dealt with, if at all, in her inner Goddess dialogues.

0545265355|5.0|I am 69 read a lot of books in my time but nothing even close to these books. I loved the movie, I had all three books before I went to see it. I had set them up and not read them before I saw the movie. I am so glad I did, I had gave the movie five stars, but after I read the first book I went back and gave it three. The movie highlighted the book. I am into the last book and it has taken a complete turn around,to be a seventeen year old she is way ahead of the age. Don't let these books pass you by I am sorry it's about end I hope there will be another three. I want to see her grow up.

B008RYN44U|2.0|So many reasons why this album isnt working for me. I shouldn't have to train myself to like an album. The album isn't awful but it definitely not worth the wait at all. This isn't even Rock or even Pop/Rock- Its closer to Trance music, The sound that I thought Gwen would have as a solo artist. The name of this band should be 'Sold Doubt' because that's exactly what they've done. They 'fixed' themselves- they grew up anyway and had kids so they're minds are different anyway. They're business people- its not about how cool anyone can be or who can make a statement. Those days are gone- they have.mouths to feed, its a whole new ballgame hunny.<br /><br />For starters I'm a huge fan of retro, vintage, throwbacks etc however these songs are literally boring- I've been trying to get into this album and its just getting to be like sitying in history class on a block schedule. The only songs I find listenable are \\"Heaven\\" \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Undercover\\" everything else is bland. There's no personality or spunk anywhere on this album whatsoever. Where's the art? Where's the show? Where's the energy? Where's the entertainment? These songs can put anyone to sleep. Does it really take a band to do these songs? Gwen could've did this album under her own name. I'm shocked that this is all they came up with since 2007, this isn't good.<br /><br />What makes this album even less listenable is the mastering of the songs. The songs are mixed to high. Can anyone say LOUDNESS WAR?<br /><br />I'm disgusted.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I have HP home print on three devices two android and one Ipod. It works quick and easy with no issues. I would recommend this to any one that does most of their work on any tablet or pad device.
B000P0J0AQ|4.0|I just saw this last week. I have to say, it was very good. The whole slow-motion thing got annoying after a while, and I expected the characters to be a little more fleshed out. But overall, I really kinda loved it. The costumes were so cool--black leather isn't that interesting, but they pulled it off. The Lobby scene has to be my favorite scene, not because I'm a lover of violence (I'm not), but because it must've been so fun to film, and how the guard reacts when Neo goes through the scanner. The script could've been better, and the Agents were a little boring, but it was visually entertaining, and there was something about it that I really felt drawn to.<br /><br />Now, humans probably wouldn't be stupid enough to put out the sun(that's really STUPID!!), and in the sequels, I feel like things are too easy for him because he manipulates the Matrix too easily. But the first movie was really good, and the costumes are cool, and it's just a great movie. I can see Hollywood trying to pull this off again, and in no way does it ever work because this was pretty original, and original stuff can't be copied.<br /><br />So. Red pill, or blue pill?<br />~Harpingonforever

B00902AKK4|4.0|loved this game on my iphone so excited it is now available on kindle. love that this is challenging but not impossible. simple concept that gets you thinking.
0439023521|1.0|I picked this book up randomly, and I found myself becoming one of those people who finishes an awful book only to see if it gets any better. Honestly, this was worse than Nevermore(Maximum Ride, book 8)! As a writer, I know that a whole bunch of flashbacks is a BAD thing! There were how many flashbacks in this book?<br /><br />Also, the protagonist, Katniss, is completely unlikable. I've read many stories with characters who were seriously, fundamentally flawed, but still had at least a few redeeming qualities that made the story able to resolve and the reader able to identify with the character. Katniss was seriously, fundamentally flawed, but had no redeeming qualities whatsoever. And there were no moral dilemmas like you'd expect her to have, no moments where her character grew. If you were faced with kill or be killed, don't you think you, as a person, would grow?<br /><br /> It's very challenging to write a likable character that's still pretty awful, but don't show your readers all the backstory. We were shown all the backstory through FLASHBACKS!! It's like an iceberg: only show them the tip, then the character's actions will exhibit the rest. There were no redemptive actions here.<br /><br />EDIT: So, also, more of what I didn't like about the book.<br />The writing style was a bit...off. There was too much use of the LY and ING adverbs, which is a total no-no. Now, the premise of the book is a little horrible, too, but I'm not gonna rant about that.<br />The world-building was sketchy at best (Hey, coal-mining towns, or \\"Districts\\" aren't always starving and poor) and there's also a bit of a flaw here: If Katniss and Gale are always out hunting and trading the food they get for other stuff, shouldn't they be rich? And also, if hunting is illegal, then how do they get away with it?<br />The book honestly felt a bit like Ender's Game to me, but without the literary quality and depth of character. Same level of angst, but not the same level of quality. And a similar premise as well.<br /><br />And I couldn't help thinking-- Oh, convenient that Katniss has always been a light sleeper. Oh, it was convenient that she didn't get a chance to steal from that group's food store, or she would've been blown up! Oh, it was convenient that she's such a good shot. Oh, it seems convenient that this year's Hunger Games was in a forest, like she was used to. Oh, it was convenient that--Okay, I think you get the picture.<br /><br />All the problems were completely taken care of for them, like her dilemma with Rue. Or medicine or food magically dropping from the sky when they needed them most. I felt no suspense whatsoever because the FIRST PERSON VIEWPOINT CHARACTER NEVER GETS KILLED! When they were about to eat the Nightlock berries, I was like,<br />\\"Whatever. Good. Fine; it means I won't have to deal with you anymore.\\"<br /><br />If you want good fiction, the kind that makes you think, the kind that makes you care about the characters, don't read The Hunger Games. Don't waste your time on this.<br /><br />~Harpingonforeversimilar premise as well.<br /><br />And I couldn't help thinking-- Oh, convenient that Katniss has always been a light sleeper.

B00459GJUM|3.0|I enjoyed the first season until the last episode.  What is it with following the 'GOD' signal through the Universe?  I thought this series was about seeing the 'GODS' as false and that the ancients were the ones really go all this 'GOD' work.  I can see why this series was canceled.  Maybe sense they set the stage for this to be revisited in 2014.  I can see where they talk able the each part of the journey being needed before the next step is taken.  This is a very Buddhist approach to a journey.  I hope the movie where they re-visit this in 2014 improves the story line.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters after not having seen even ONE trailer. I loved the movie. I almost never pay for movies at home, but I bought this movie. It's worth actually paying for.

B008MG1E4A|5.0|No Easy Day is an incredibly Detailed account of the mission to kill Osama Bin Laden. There has been some controversy concerning whether classified information was discussed, but there was nothing in the way of tactics, technology, or weapons that I was not already aware of. However, I certainly don't know what the military and State department wanted to keep confidential about the mission.<br />There is a warrior code among the elite military forces themselves that Mark Ownen may have violated in the eyes of his team, but it is an excellent account of the training and professionalism of the elite forces that take on these kinds of assignments.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|A friend recommended this game & now I am hooked! It's a great way to pass the time, and it is easy to play - whether or not you have drawing skills. I like that you are given easy, medium & hard selections each time you draw something, so you can choose your own comfort level.

0763644765|4.0|I bought this book along with a new potty training seat for my almost 2 year old daughter.  I thought it would be a great book to go along with the theme, and something we could start reading at bed time.  The book itself is great, my daughter loves the author's books.  The problem is that one of the pages in the copy that was sent to us is upside down, so it makes it very difficult to read together.  I will definitely be hesitant to buy another children's book online without being able to check for this again!
B005N4F48Q|5.0|Absolutely love the extended edition, which contains some very interesting scenes not included in the version that was initially released.  In some cases, the newly included scenes offers good insight into the characters from a historical and contextual perspective.  Others were just \\"nice to have\\".
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this book. Kate Morton Is such a gifted and creative writer! I really had a great vision in my head of the time periods and places this story takes the reader to, not to mention the characters! Looking forward to reading The House at Riverton!
0374275637|3.0|The book contains very interesting and useful material on how our brains work. Some of it is very surprising, particularly if you've not read much in this field. The idea of calling the different modes of thought 'system 1' and 'system 2' works well as does the more anthropomorphic metaphor.<br /><br />The book is very parochial. It is written for US readers, so it is extremely repetitive, labouring quite simple points heavily. It also assumes knowledge of American arcana. It'd be nice to have an English edition.<br /><br />There's also an understandable, given the author's past, but irritating political undertone. It isn't pleasant to be reading a book about thinking and then to be exposed to jarring remarks based on the assumption that the Israeli killing machine is a wonderful thing. If he wanted to write a political book, that'd be fair enough, but this isn't supposed to be one. I think his publishers could have exercised some restraint in this.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love pinterest! There are so many great ideas. This app tho freezes up often. I like it a lot but often ibhave to close out and reopen it to get it to work right. This happens 3 to 5 times a day. so not too bad but I wish it was better.

B003Y5H5HY|1.0|I love the Swedish version of the trilogy.  When I saw this American preview version with Daniel Craig, I thought this will be fantastic and will be a trilogy I would like to have in my collection.  However, after watching it (even tho it is so close to the book), I can't help but to think why was this even remade?  American movie with English speaking actors trying so hard to speak English with a Swedish accent?  And the girl, no expression whatsoever thru the whole movie.  Noomi knows when to be expressionless and when to express a little.  And the bad guys in the original, you couldn't help but really despise them.  This version, the bad guys were more of jokers than acting like bad guys where you love to hate.  I cried at the end of the original.  This one, I said \\"What de Hell?\\"  Sorry, I won't be collecting nor I will see the rest of the trilogy at the theater period.

The journey that Harold Fry takes enables him and his wife Maureen time to realize what is really important in life. Each other!! I really enjoyed this book, it certainly made me think of the relationships in my own life.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Overall, pretty lame.<br />In my opinion, the story is not well written; actually anticlimatic as it develops ever so slowly. This book came on strong with as much hype as the Superbowl, not much meat in the bowel on this one.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|If you like puzzles then this game is for you.  This game gets better,  and harder,  the longer you play it. I couldn't. Stop playing it once I downloaded it. Its super fun and defineitely worth a download.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|okay, seriously. you should purchase this. it is perfect for every kind of edit there is. filters, stickers, even a meme maker. Make your photos have something everyone else's doesn't! achieve that with this app. *PERFECT with kindle fire.
B00011KHTM|3.0|This connector worked okay. If you can find a cabale that connects from the Mini-dvi to the monitor I would recommend that over this adaptor. The problem is that the VGA adaptor is heavy and bulky when connected and if you move your laptop ever so slightly the mini-dvi comes out of the computer. It is good for occasional use but I wish I would have bought a superior connector.
0985114606|1.0|I loved 50 Shades of Grey and had high hopes for this book. Sure, Sylvia Day is a better writer than E.L. James, but I hated the book! The story was identical appart from the excessive pornographic descriptions and crude language used by Sylvia Day. If you have read 50 Shades and loved it, DO NOT read this book.

So a visit from grandparents meant that we were going to see a movie - any movie - and \\"House at the End of the Street\\" (HATES) was the winner.<br /><br />The movie begins with the delectable Elisabeth Shue (who will always Chris Parker from Adventures in Babysitting for me) as Sarah, a toned newly divorced mom starting her life over with daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence, who up close has a peculiar face) in a new neighborhood that just happens to be nearby a murder house. Years earlier, Carrie-Ann (Eva Link) murdered her parents (Krista Bridges and John Healey) in their beds. The only survivor is Ryan (Max Thieriot), raised by a dottering old aunt. Now Ryan continues to live in the house, planning to fix it up, and of course Elissa is attracted to him because he's so soulful, sad, and damaged. Like a defanged version of Edward Cullen, without all the bloodsucking.<br /><br />What's so refreshing about HATES is how it hides in plain sight. We see early on that Ryan's actually keeping Carrie-Ann in a hidden room beneath the house. In a twist on the traditional horror tropes, Carrie-Ann regularly escapes and charges towards the nearest house with Ryan in hot pursuit trying to stop her from murdering poor unsuspecting Elissa.<br /><br />Elissa is a talented musician, so it's not long before she makes friends and enemies when she rejects the advances of reigning rich kid Tyler (Nolan Gerard Funk) advances. Things get dangerous when Tyler decides to publicly beat up Ryan at the battle of the bands and someone snaps someone else's ankle like a twig. And that's the moment when things go sideways.<br /><br />HATES has to be creative with its PG-13 rating, which means that people get stabbed but rarely bleed. Instead, the audio is cranked up so that we hear every groan of agony. There's also less jump-out-of-your-seat scares and more disturbing interactions in which the long, sad history of the murder house is peeled back, layer by layer.<br /><br />HATES is not a great film. Characters do stupid things, archetypes act like stereotypes, and Ryan is so sappy-sad that after awhile you just want to give him some ice cream. But despite its formulaic approach and Lawrence's occasional lapses, HATES is surprisingly fearless...perhaps because it has nothing to lose.<br /><br />This is what horror looks like in an era post-\\"Scream.\\" It has to be sneaky by showing you the horror without letting you know what you're seeing. And in that regard HATES still has some tricks up its sleeve for jaded horror fans.ich the long, sad history of the murder house is peeled back, layer by layer.<br /><br />HATES is not a great film.

B006BAEQB2|5.0|Philippa Gregory continues her series of novels about the extraordinary group of women who figured in 15th century struggles between Lancastrians and Yorkists (only later called the Wars of the Roses). \\"The Red Queen\\" and \\"The White Queen\\" centered on two of the more well-known:  Margaret of Anjou, who married the Lancastrian King Henry VI and fought his battles; and Elizabeth Woodville, who was a central figure in the long reign of her husband, the Yorkist King Edward IV. The protagonist of \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\" is Anne Neville, less well known but by no means less interesting.  Anne was the daughter of the Earl of Warwick (the \\"kingmaker\\" whose changing allegiances during the dynastic struggle had far-reaching effects) and wife of the last Yorkist king, Richard III. She is the narrator of this novel, beginning at age eleven and ending just before her death in 1485, a few months before the battle that finally ended the conflict.<br /><br />  Any interpretation of the character of Anne, whether historical of fictional, must confront the question of her husband's character:  was he the murderous tyrant depicted by Shakespeare, or the much-maligned victim of Tudor slander described in some 20th-century works?  In The Kingmaker's Daughter, Richard is an important, but only a supporting, character.  Seen through Anne's eyes, he is neither hero nor villain, but a lover and an ambitious politician. Gregory does not pass judgment on whether he might have committed crimes of which Anne was unaware. Rather, as in the other novels in the series, she makes clear that fifteenth-century marriages, while not necessarily excluding love or passion, were above all dynastic arrangements bearing little resemblance to modern models. Richard is depicted just ambiguously enough to allow readers to draw our own conclusions.  Anne is presented sympathetically, but not hagiographically; she too had ambitions and faults.<br /><br />For the most part Gregory follows the undisputed historical facts faithfully, while building on them imaginatively to create memorable characters and an engaging plot.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love a challange and the game was great.  Highly recomended!!!  Many levels that got harder and make you think.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Many more. I just saw Joe and his band in Bangkok and met him and his band. I was happy to get autographs and photos. Now there was nothing not to like as Joe can sing and play like a (possessed man.) His encore blew the house down with some Jeff Beck and Led Zeppelin.<br />I can not walk good and had to have help but got out. I will be back next year if I can. He can play rings around many out there now. I will not name names, he may be best talent out there. Started playing at 5 years old. Was a pro at 12/15 years old. Now at 30 ish is one of the best playing blues/rock or anything he chooses. Go see him please. Stevie Ray smiles down at Joe and yes I am hooked. Hello to Carmen please and thanks.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|With volume pumped all the way up and wearing headphones I could still barely hear.<br /><br />The movie was great although typical Marvel fast-action, lot of explosions kind of fare, I enjoyed it.<br /><br />The sound volume ruined the experience.
B000FC10MU|4.0|I liked the premise of this book and got caught up in it pretty quickly. I think things got lost toward the end. Actually there really wasn't an ending, the promised great confrontation which seemed to be such a central theme never took place. I guess even the author realized that the outcome would have been too one sided, but still even lost causes can be somehow emotionally satisfying, sort of like the elves leaving middle earth in Lord of the Rings. I wish I could write, I would rewrite the ending.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it but don't trust the people that are on the list they are just loser.I love it you can buy carter in store but you have to get money when your playing when you see the money you got to get it so bey

B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved the first book of The Hunger Games. It was great.  Catching fire is good. Not as good, but still good.  The writing style is a little different, a little more complex and, in a way, more mature.  The plot isn't quite as strong. Would I reccomend reading it? Yes if you absolutely adored the Hunger Games and nothing I or anything else says will change your mind. However, I, looking back, wish I hadn't read the final two books as they slightly ruined the first one in my opinion. I would much rather have looked up a summary on wikipedia or something. But do what you will :)
B009329ZF2|5.0|My family and I thought the movie was awesome. Very entertaining.  It was fast moving and entertaining.  Ful of drama and real live special effects action.
0425263908|5.0|Great story and WELL WRITTEN. As for claims of plagiarism, what do you call 50 Shades? Pot, kettle - kettle, pot. Fully recommend this title! :)
B005HESDSK|5.0|I haven't seen this episode in a long time and while I liked it many years ago, I still relegated it to being a \\"fluffy\\" episode.  Much better than I remember and it actually shows that Marina Sirtis can act, unlike many more episodes.  Due to a transporter accident 8 years ago, there are now 2 Rikers, with the recently discovered one still being in the frame of mind of having just left Betazed and looking forward to meeting up with Troi on Risa.  So now there is a Riker actively pursuing Troi and she has to decide what to do about it.  I liked that we got to hear how she felt after Riker chose his career over her- it made her very human.
055357342X|4.0|Not the best fantasy series, but still I have enjoyed it immensely.  Even better if you skip over the \\"Daenerys\\" chapters.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|very helpful app. it keeps me aware of all the info I need. the only negative is the app pops up everytime I turn kindle on. I'm not sure if the free version lets me customize the Color that would be nice. I recommend this app to everyone. I love FREE apps!
B005ZC0SYQ|5.0|The saddest thing about this great picture is that Brandon Lee died too soon.  Watch it and see what a major star we have missed.  His performance would be equal to an early Steve McQueen.  The movie is  equal to the Terminator movies.  The star power passes Arnold.  This is a little known movie but it should be on anyones top ten just for the performance of Brandon Lee.
B0099G3I96|4.0|No Doubt hasn't released a non-compilation, studio album since Rock Steady in 2001, it's been 11 years. I have seen them twice in concert since Rock Steady came out. I have all of their albums, even their early pre-Tragic Kingdom stuff.  I consider myself a fan.<br /><br />It is hard to write a review on an album RIGHT after first listening to it, but I am going to try. I downloaded the album at midnight on release night (Sept. 25, 2012) and listened to it straight away. Below are my notes I made on each track as I listened to it.<br /><br />01.) Settle down: (single -- heard it before the album was released) charged, good drums, energetic -- *2nd favorite song on album<br />02.) Looking Hot: Electronica, good beat, reminiscent of Tragic Kingdom (ska horns are back!)<br />03.) One More Summer: Slower, ballad<br />04.) Push and Shove: (single -- heard it before the album was released) faster, ska horns, Jamaican vibes, GOOD! -- *1st favorite on album<br />05.) Easy: Electronica, slower,<br />06.) Gravity: Electronica, 1980's pop-feel (kind of terrible)<br />07.) Undercover: Standard No-Doubt feeling song, little slow<br />08.) Undone: Slower, ballad<br />09.) Sparkle: Strong ska intro, good horns, good lyrical melody, VERY similar to Tragic Kingdom/Return of Saturn -- *3rd favorite song on album<br />10.) Heaven: Electronica, good melody, good beat, catchy -- *4th favorite on album<br />11.) Dreaming The Same Dream: Electronica, 1980's pop-synth feel, mellow, slow build-up to stronger middle crescendo<br /><br />Overall -- I like it. It is a little more mellow than I would prefer. It doesn't have the Rock-Ska energy of No Doubt, or the Beacon Street Collection, or Tragic Kingdom. It doesn't have the angsty riffs and anger rock of Return of Saturn (or any really catchy ballads), and it (thankfully) doesn't have the Let's-Go-Jamaiican vibe of Rock Steady. It is it's own album.  When Gwen, Tony, Adrian and Tom wrote their early ska-rock stuff in the late 1980's/early 1990's, they were in their teens and early twenties. They were in their mid-twenties for Return of Saturn, and hitting their thirties for Rock Steady. They are in their forties now, and their evolution of their music is showing their changing views on life, and their music.<br /><br />Push and shove isn't as raw edged rocky and charged with ska as I would prefer, but Push & Shove, Settle Down, Sparkle, Looking Hot, & Heaven show that the band still has it (and if you haven't heard them play Stand & Deliver yet, you are missing out).<br /><br />4 stars. I loves me my No Doubt.90's, they were in their teens and early twenties. They were in their mid-twenties for Return of Saturn, and hitting their thirties for Rock Steady.

B0099G3I96|4.0|It's been 11 years since No Doubt released Rock Steady, and today they give us Push and Shove.  While Rock Steady was a departure from the ska sound that made them famous, Push and Shove is more of a natural progression from Rock Steady.  The reggae influences are dialed back quite a bit.  The lead single \\"Settle Down\\" has subtle reggae strokes in the rhythm guitar, and \\"Looking Hot\\" uses reggae vocal style on the bridge.  The most overt is \\"Push And Shove\\", but even it is not the mellow more traditional rendition of \\"Underneath It All\\".  No, \\"Push And Shove\\" is more of a reggae tinged rap collaboration with Major Lazer and Busy Signal.  If you were hoping for more big names like Prince or Ric Ocasek, you will be disappointed.  I found \\"Push And Shove\\" to be one of the weaker tracks on the album.<br /><br />Forgive me, though, for I have buried the lead.  What I really noticed on the majority of Push and Shove is that Gwen Stefani's voice seems to have a higher degree of warmth.  Her delivery on the verses of \\"One More Summer\\" reminded me a lot of Madonna's classic \\"Live To Tell\\".  While the song styles are a bit different, focus on the vocals.  I found this to be a change for the better.  While No Doubt's early work was super catchy, Gwen's delivery could drift into whiny and nasal territory.  I didn't notice this to any real extent on Push and Shove.<br /><br />If you listen to the lyrics, you will find plenty of familiar relationship territory \\"Undercover\\", \\"Undone\\", and \\"Sparkle\\".  However, I also noticed lines that could apply to the amount of time that has passed since their last studio album.  On \\"One More Summer\\" we have \\"I can't believe it.  Has it really been this long?\\" while we find \\"I don't know where all the time went.\\" on \\"Gravity\\".  Most No Doubt fans are probably thinking similar things about the gap.<br /><br />In the end, Push and Shove is the next step in the musical style progression for No Doubt.  It ties enough to Rock Steady, but you may find subtle references to older material.  Here's one for you.  Let the trombone solo on \\"Sparkle\\" take you back to \\"Total Hate\\" from the Beacon Street Collection in 1995.  There something here for all No Doubt fans, and I recommend Push and Shove to anyone who has ever enjoyed their music.<br /><br />Download this:  One More Summersubtle references to older material.

B008Y2FRFO|3.0|its ok games its not that bad it can get boring but its a ok game I like it! not love it :)
B0068FYZ3Y|5.0|Great movie!! It has comedy and violence which makes the movie so great. Quentin Tarentino is a genius at what he does. Watching the movie in blue ray makes it that much better. It's a must get if you are a Tarentino fan.
B007SSEU9O|4.0|This movie is not a detailed chronology of events.  Rather it is a look into the motivation and determination of PM Thatcher.  It is amazing how the persona of Meryl Streep is lost and all you see is Mrs. Thatcher.  Meryl's skill as an actress is superb.  I do believe the movie should have shown more of the close cooperation between Thatcher and Reagan.  While Reagan got almost all of the credit for ending the Cold War, he could not have done it without PM Thatcher.
0071762345|5.0|This book is perfect for a beginner is the social media business or a long time business owner looking to shake things up and connect with a new crowd. Filled with ideas, examples, actionable to do lists. Just get it!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I personaly thought this book was good but Ive read the whole series and wish I never read it because I thought the books after this would have been as good as the first.Id just read this book and forget the rest.But thats kinda hard to do when your expecting something great....But this book isnt too bad its an interesting read.<br />L.A.Bartley<br />{a Green Day fan]
B008M34CSI|2.0|Or better a kind of a B Computerized Movie.<br />Claustrophobic because the location is a space base ...no more claustrophobic: is a space cryogenic prison (and not too much to spend on sets).<br />Not as 'positively' claustrophobic like in Alien to be clear.<br />My expectations weren't high and this is below that.<br />A movie to watch in a boring sunday afternoon, nothing more epic then this.
B007HO392S|2.0|Gave this album 2 stars because I like 2 songs on it - Good Girl and Blow Away.  The rest of the album is awful.  It's all slow songs.  Now, I love a good slow song, but these songs are a pain to listen to - and not a good heartfelt pain.  They are boring and hard to get all the way through.  I listened to the whole album to try and be objective and it was very difficult to do.  I kept wanting to hit the \\"next\\" button.  Carrie should have worked on this a little bit harder.  Good thing her album was called Blown Away.  I was \\"Blown Away\\" how bad it was.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Very good. Keeps your interest the whole time, more than one jaw dropper a great read I was sad it had to end but very much like how she ended it.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|It was all predictable I knew what was going to happen.I wish I never read the series because to me this book was such a waste of time.If I read the first book and left it at that I would have been fine but the author just dropped in the second book and this one.This was such a disapointment to me after all Ive heard about it.<br />L.A.Bartley<br />[A Green Day fan]
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I have to admit the first few pages of this story didn't draw me in. I don't know what it was, but it took about half of the first book before I decided I would stick with the it. He is a new author to me and I like to give an author's work a chance before I decide to write them off. Book two caught my interest and helped me to decide to finish the series. I am really glad I did. The concept for the story appears quite original. The omnibus is, by no means, fast-paced or action-packed, but it is interesting and entertaining. The characters are solid and well-developed, as is the story. Enough so, it made me want to find out more about this author and his other works. When I discovered a sixth book to this series has been written, a prequel, I downloaded it immediately. This author writes well. When he describes situations, areas, people, etc., it is easy to visualize and live it in your head. An example would be when he described the shards of glass left behind in the frame of a window which had just been shot up by bullets, as \\"transparent teeth\\". Instantly, I visualized an open mouth with clear teeth and it just enhanced the story for me. It was those little moments of vivid visualization that helped bring this story to life. As readers we want to be taken away from our everyday lives, and thrown into a world unknown to us. We want to go on these adventures with the characters and feel what they're feeling. Great writing can make that happen and I feel Hugh Howie's writing helps to enhance his story. If you haven't read this omnibus, I'd recommend it. Go into it knowing that it's not a super-fast, high-octane thriller. It is not s-l-o-w paced; it's just not edge-of-your-seat paced. Go into it knowing that and I think you will find a treasure here.
B000UNYJV8|5.0|I had seen This is England on T.V.  I just had to get the movie.  It was so happy, sad, angry at times.  Be careful you buy it in the right area zone.  I got my first copy and it was NON-USA format.  Now I keep looking for This is Englad 86 & 88.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was compelling, gripping, sad, funny at times, terrifying most of the time, but a very worthwhile read. I loved it. I agree with other reviewers that the politics could be toned down a bit, but I also get the frustration our soldiers must feel when faced with these life and death decisions. There is no clear cut answer. There is also some repetition here and there, but hey...this book was written by a young man in his 20's, not a career author, so it reads more like a diary sometimes which is not a bad thing, you just have to understand that. Overall I would HIGHLY recommend this book, I was moved and remain in awe of this level of dedication to fight for our country.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I like the first book way better.This made me start to lose interest,the first book made it seem this second would have been great but to me this floped.<br />L.A.Bartley<br />[ A Green Day fan]

B008OTTSX4|2.0|Iron Maiden and Glenn Hughes were great the rest I didn't care for, especially the Metallica track which was dissapointing.  Over all not something I would spend money on save the Maiden and Huges tracks.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|not bad real dr seuss style. little preachie but still funny and cute great for young kids. play stream was great no lag or buffering ran just like netflix.
B00846REIS|4.0|It was good and I do look forward to reading the next book in the series. I felt as if it was almost a knock off of 50 Shades.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I really did not like this movie. Do not go to movies because of my  handicap was a waist of my money.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|I won't bother with a summary - you can find that on any of the other reviews.  I simply did not like this book.  The kindle edition was filled with errors - even some paragraphs repeating themselves, words repeated, etc.  Please re-edit!<br />The story was boring and frustrating.  A relationship book.  A couple who get together and fight and break up, make up, fight, break up, make up again.<br />At exactly 52%, I started to become intrigued with where the story was going only to find it fall flat and go back to fight, break up, make up...repeat and reverse.<br />I read it for book club otherwise I would have never finished it.
B002XHNMVM|5.0|I found this book especially helpful now that I have small kids of my own. It is also good to know that it is never too late to step into your element.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the book, loved the suspense all the way up until the end, a real page turner. The author is a wonderful story teller even if the characters are not likable.
B006VFQGFQ|3.0|The movie was okay.  The historical information in the movie is interesting, but dependent upon your age (if you remember the period) or your interest in history, you may or may not like it.  The acting was good, and I hadn't realized how powerful J Edgar was until I watched this movie.
