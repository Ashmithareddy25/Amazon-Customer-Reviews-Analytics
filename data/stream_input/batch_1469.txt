0307951529|5.0|This book was quick and easy to read. I found the information to be useful and I appreciated the personal examples of businesses in a variety of industries from mattress sales to map makers to consultants. I felt that there could have been a little more detail about how to build a customer base for your product launch, but I did notice some helpful references in the footnotes about websites with information on SEO and other things that might be helpful in answering some of those questions. Ultimately I found this book to be highly motivational. Give yourself the freedom to go ahead and start that microbusiness! Whether you want to start a part time venture or go at it full time, the message here is that you need to be willing to work at something you love, you need to find a way to create value and experience for your customers, and you need to have the courage to go for it!

1451648537|3.0|Way too much repetition. How many times do we have to hear about the Apple closed system vs the Widows or Android approach?  I got it the first time. He could easily have cut out 1/4 of the book. Also I don't buy thew whole reasoning behind the itunes ipod connection being for simplicity. there's nothing simple about having to hook my music player to a computer and open a program in order to delete a song from my player, instead of simply selecting the song on the player and choosing delete. It's obviously a way of forcing you to go through itunes to get you to pay for content.

B004YF6MHW|5.0|An all around superior camera.  I first started using it as a work around to the buggy stock camera on my Droid 3.  Very quick, responsive shutter.  Tons of *free* editing and filter add-ons!  This is the camera app that pros use when their SLR isn't handy.  This app is the boss when it come to camera apps.

B007NESBK2|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Sade twice on last year's Soldier of Love tour.  As someone who sees a lot live concerts, it takes quite a bit for me to 'bow down'.  With this show, I couldn't bow down deeply enough.  Great song selection, a spectacular but tasteful stage presentation coupled with Sade's obvious appreciation of her audience's long standing loyalty, resulted in one of the best shows I've seen in the last 20 years.<br />The bluray edition of the concert film is immaculately produced and is a perfect record of a perfect show.  I can't recommend this disc strongly enough.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book, almost done with the whole trilogy.  Don't buy just the one, get the whole thing.  It leaves you wanting more.

I am currently working on the second book and I find it hard to work or do anything with out thinking about the story. The author did a wonderful job making it feel like Christian Grey is right there with you!!!
B0050OMJIW|5.0|The writing is a joy to read. Digesting the words and the flow and the masterful way Heller leaps from place to place and time to time is simply delicious. This book is a feast of characters and of words. One of my all-time favourites and a book destined to last through the centuries.
0393061310|1.0|How can a book pretend to be scientific, while its arguments are constructed from fallacies and hand picked examples?<br /><br />How can a book that is supposedly set to combat racist statements about advanced groups show hatred towards some of them?<br /><br />Here is a list of a few aspects of this book:<br /><br />1) The author does not seem to have done intensive research on each of the topics that he aims at. Instead, he ping pongs on many social sciences and \\"assumes\\" the rest of the drivers. In fact, I wrote the word in inverted commas because he uses it exceedingly in his speech.<br /><br />For instance, he concludes that small bands or tribes don't fight in wars with willingness to give up their lives proudly and that the erection of States is necessary for this to happen, for fighters to be willing to die for the group they belong to. This is not necessarily the case, as many available examples show, such as the Mapuches in Patagonia. Still today this group, which gave headaches in the XVI century to the Spanish to the point that the latter could not get past the center of Chile in their conquest, is claiming its rights. Mapuches didn't have an organized State, were nomads and hunter-gatherers, exactly the opposite of the author's assertion. Most importantly, the Mapuches are and were one of the most influential tribes in South America.<br /><br />Another example: he misses completely the terrible state of the Inca people at the time of Spanish arrival, which has been well documented. The Incas had a terrible state of affairs socially, as they were enslaved by the Emperor, starved to death and mistreated. This factor is crucial in their resignation to belong to the Spanish as slaves. Having dedicated a few chapters to the Incas, Diamond never makes mention of this important feature. Furthermore, the author cites only one letter, which is thought by historians to be extremely biased so as to show Spanish prowess and to justify the killings. However, the author never warns against this. (You can read Todorov's major work to obtain an idea of how wrong the author is on the Spanish conquest of America).<br /><br />Another example: it is obvious that the author either did not read Rousseau's \\"The Social Contract\\", or else he missed the point completely, which could have been the case had he read Hobbes and Locke. Besides, isn't it strange to dedicate a full chapter to the question of the State and to never mention Locke? Rousseau, or Locke or Hobbes for that matter, didn't refer to the beginnings of civilization. Their metaphors portray theoretical cases that are placed in Europe's (mainly the western part's) state of affairs at the time at which they were writing. They made the point that democracy was a necessary attainment, a direct democracy form from Rousseau's perspective, an indirect one from Locke's, and under a ruler from Hobbes' standpoint. In fact, this is one of the theories on which the French Revolution based its movement, Rousseau's call to make a State for the people, where the people could make decisions. I can't see what link this can have to the erection of the Roman or Inca Empires, as Rousseau did not write for that audience. Diamond's criticism on Rousseau would be pretty similar to taking down Marx or Nietzsche for their theories on the productive phases and the genealogy of morals, respectively.<br /><br />One more example: what the author calls \\"The Anna Karenina Principle\\" is completely wrong. The first lines by Tolstoy are not related to the number of aspects that a marriage needs to succeed (or fail) on, but to how families differ from each other when they are unhappy and how more interesting they become when they are so, whereas happy families are always the same (presumably a few of us would only pay attention to happy families as it's all the same what reason they are happy for, whereas unhappy families give room to gossip and to an interesting story that could give birth to a book such as Tolstoy's).<br /><br />2) The author chooses to use his personal life experience in his fieldwork (working with birds presumably). He also elects to speak about diversity in California based on how many nationalities his children's friends belong to, or he talks about malaria and other deceases based on his European and American friends who had to leave New Guinea because of tropical illnesses. There are many of these cases throughout the book. Isn't science supposed to fight this commonsensical approach? Where are the statistics of illnesses and fatal deceases, or the diversity numbers from the State of California?<br /><br />3) He seems to have a grudge of some kind against Japanese, given the repeatedly derogatory comments that the author writes about its language and culture. He labels Japanese language as \\"horrendously cumbersome\\" that should be replaced for \\"efficient alphabets\\" (a pity he never says the same about Chinese, which he acknowledges uses the same system that the Japanese inherited from China. This is a major reflection of the author's predisposition towards Japanese culture).<br /><br />I don't think that Japanese and those of us who love the beauty and detail of Japanese language think that Japan should send its national language to the dogs anytime soon. Language is a manifestation of identity and history for a country, how can an author who claims to be attempting to fight racist approaches write such down comments on national identity?<br /><br />Additionally, he is wrong about the use of kana, which is not only a nice set of writings for \\"telegrams\\" as Diamond states. Hiragana is absolutely necessary for particles and grammar, such as verb terminations, and many words don't have the equivalent Chinese symbol, for which they can only be written in hiragana. Also katakana is used for foreign words. Japanese are a model of incorporation of foreign elements without overriding their own culture. Information about the use of kana can easily be found by doing a search on Wikipedia or any encyclopedia (or Japanese kanji dictionary).<br /><br />4) Circular arguments, fallacies and out of the blue assumptions are the general rule. For instance, from page 284 (paperback) the result is: Why are societies complex? --> Because they are big in number of members. Why are societies big in number of members? --> Because they are complex. The author never provides any driver to get out of this labyrinth, which he sets himself in.<br /><br />5) The book is so repetitive, that I had to drag myself to the end. The argument is: \\"food production\\", that is what it boils down to. The rest of the factors, for instance geography or technology, are all linked to food production. Those that could achieve agriculture first, presumably thanks to their incredible geography, are the ones that had a head start and that were able to have people to build weaponry, writing systems, inventions, etc. This is a common fallacy called \\"begging the question\\" (petitio principii). The author assumes that it takes all peoples the same number of years to excel in food production, which can be seen by his repeated argument that if such people had not invaded such other people, the latter could have achieved agriculture or other advances if they had been provided due time (as an example from the book, why couldn't it have taken natives in the Pampas region in Argentina, with its excellent soil and benign climate, less time to master local produce as opposed to the people in Europe? However, the former group never achieved the power that Europeans did. In fact, the author poses this question but never answers it).<br /><br />Furthermore, assumptions on what country has better instances for inventors to rise are judgmental rather than scientific. The author never treats the direct relationship between capital and technological advancements, which has been a main topic of discussion in a branch of economics called \\"development economics\\", specifically by the endogenous development theories and by theories entertained with Beta Convergence across the globe, which became a major topic of discussion after the WWII (and hence, there are hundreds of papers and books written about this topic).<br /><br />6) Most importantly: where is culture in this entire picture? Sapiens is, according to Diamond, a product of food production, which led to expansion. The only cultural features mentioned by the author are some of the paintings in caves (topic that can be read extensively in newspapers), pottery (only praise to Japan) and writing. The latter seems to be there to justify how some groups could expand extensively based on written stories about other peoples, navigation maps, etc.<br /><br />Anthropologists that instead of watching birds actually spent time with the descendents of the peoples that the author refers to (Levi-Strauss, Malinowski, to name only a few of the greatest figures in social sciences) have taken the pains to write down detailed explanations as to the traits in cultural development that made Sapiens what it is today.<br /><br />In Diamond's account, where is exogamy which played a crucial role in creating the diversity in races and cultures that exist today and the dispersion of Sapiens across the globe? Edgar Morin in his bio-anthropological work (not only a scientific achievement, but also a work of art) explains a dialectic relationship between brain expansion and cultural complexity, which were possible thanks to exogamy, a treat that is explained extensively by Claude Levi-Strauss and that was later taken by Freud in his anthropological and psychology studies.<br /><br />I could go on and on to write several pages... but I think that I made my point across.<br /><br />If you want to read a beautiful revamp of this topic, I suggest that you pick \\"Dark Age Ahead\\" by Jane Jacobs. She points out a few of the major mistakes in Diamond's book.<br /><br />My background: I am a student in a 5-year degree program in Philosophy and a PhD candidate in Economics. I am from South America and I speak business level Japanese, having lived in Tokyo.by doing a search on Wikipedia or any encyclopedia (or Japanese kanji dictionary).<br /><br />4) Circular arguments, fallacies and out of the blue assumptions are the general rule.

B007Z9RAX4|3.0|This could have been a much better action movie if the scenes between action sequences didn't take so long. Gina Carano's character needed more development and Bill Paxton's character was very wooden. Soderbergh did an excellent job of making her out as tough as nails but the low whispering dialog forced me to roll back the scene and turn up the volume. There is potential for a sequel but better writers are needed. I'm glad I didn't pay $12 per person plus another $11.50 for snacks to see this.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|I am sure you have read some of the reviews so what I do is give an opinion. This thriller has it all, a great storyline and some interesting and surprising twists the atmospher you can feel and the cinematography great Martin Scorsese has put together a superior thriller and shows he can do much more than war story's. I highly recommend this is a must for anyone's library who likes movies of this genre. I will always tell it like I see it.....Good or bad.<br />  SCOTT M

B0085776BG|1.0|This movie was just awful - bad dialog, bad acting, etc. Last winter I saw a story on TV with George Lucas talking about investing his own money and was excited for this to come out on instant streaming. Then I saw the trailer on TV and it looked a little weak but I still had high hopes. Maybe my expectations were just too high. I was expecting a semi-blockbuster and this felt like a TV movie of the week. I turned it off halfway through the movie so I can't even give this a rating of \\"watchable\\". Save your money.

B000V6MSJO|5.0|This is the original album that includes another cut of Lullaby of Birdland as the last track. There is another version of this album titled [[ASIN:B000786JPK Complete Recordings With Clifford Brown]] that includes eight more tracks that you may want to consider.<br /><br />Recorded and released in 1954, this is one of my favorite Sarah Vaughan albums. While the backing musicians all contributed to making this album special, with the real genius coming from Sarah, having Clifford Brown on the album is an added bonus. I do not want to diminish Clifford's contributions because I purchased this album specifically because he is on it. But make no mistake - this album showcases Sarah, and deservedly so. If I were to meet someone who was unfamiliar with her music this would be at the top of my list of recommendations.<br /><br />The other musicians backing Sarah are worth mentioning: Paul Quinichette on tenor, Herbie Mann on flute, Jimmy Jones on piano, Joe Benjamin on bass and Roy Haynes on drums. As a side note: Haynes is one of the jazz drum legends and someone who continues to inspire me.<br /><br />I usually avoid ranking one track over another because personal tastes vary. I am going to hold to that policy here because you can sample the tracks and decide for yourself. While we may disagree on which selection is best, I am certain we can agree that Sarah's voice is the most beautiful instrument in the ensemble.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|A Streetcar is a film adapted from the broadway play of the same name by Tennesse Williams which also starred Marlon Brando, Kim Hunter, and Karl Malden.  However, Blanche DuBois was changed in the movie to Vivien Leigh and she gives one of the greatest performances of her career.  Brando portrays Stanley Kowalski, a violent brute who calls himself \\"the king around here\\", and is very upset when his wife's, Kim Hunter, sister Blanche comes to stay.  Blanche is a emotionally unstable woman trying to cover up the horrors of her past through her high class attitude and elagant clothing.  All of this leads up to one of the most horrifying endinds captured on film.  This is one of the greatest movies of all time and I would recommend it to anyone.

B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I remember the day at the radio station when I picked<br />Greetings from Asbury Park out of the stack of new releases. For six of the best records of all time I was a Boss fanatic. Then, it all came unraveled with Born in the USA. I know artists have to change, but he tossed pretty much everything I loved about his music for pop songs. I check in every couple of years  --Lucky Town, Ghost of Tom Joad, Magic--but they just don't do it for me. His lyrics are more mundane, less imaginative, less moving. Wrecking Ball gave me another chance to check in, and although the old mojo still ain't there, this is the first of his albums in twenty years that is really worth a listen. We Take Care of Our Own, Wrecking Ball and Land of Hope and Dreams are the three standout tracks for me, the ones that approach the power of the Boss I used to know.<br />Jack of All Trades is ok, and the ending has some punch, but he's covered this ground before on Nebraska. Rocky Ground is so-so, the rest dont do much of anything, and the bonus track, American Land, sounds at first like a joke. I'll pull the songs I like off this and earlier records and make a great listening cd,,,and I'll check back in again in a couple of years.
0061692042|5.0|Canada is a book that is at once thrilling and extraordinily readable. It is a brilliant novel, one that any reader will not soon forget. It has all the makings of books that I love - strong characterizations, good action, inner turmoil, philosophy and emotional angst.<br /><br />The novel begins: \\"First I'll tell about the robbery our parents committed. Then about the murder, which happened later. The robbery is the more important part since it served to set my and my sister's lives on the courses they eventually followed.\\" The story is told by Dell Parsons in the first person. It starts when he is fifteen years old and is told when he is 66 years old. The year that the story begins is 1960.<br /><br />Dell and Berner Parsons are fraternal twins, Berner older by six minutes. They have lived a life traveling around with their father who is a captain in the military until they reach Great Falls, Montana where Bev Parsons, Dell's father, gets in trouble and loses his captain's stripes and is demoted to lieutenant. Rather than remain in the military, he quits. He then begins one job after another selling used cars. Their mother, Neeva, is a Jew from Tacoma, the daughter of immigrants who expected her to marry much better than she has. She and her parents are pretty much estranged and Neeva's parents have never met Dell and Berner. Neeva thinks of herself as a poet and is a weak-willed woman.<br /><br />Bev and Neeva are not well-suited to one another and got married because Neeva got pregnant after a one-night stand with Bev and they decided that marriage was the right thing to do. The marriage is not a good one and they live parallel lives rather than interacting in any depth.<br /><br />Dell starts to get into illegal dealings with the Cree indians, supplying meat for the railroad lines and then getting part of the proceeds. Things quickly go bad and Dell owes $2000. It is then that he decides to rob a bank, though to be truthful, he's thought of himself as a bank robber for many years. Dell scouts out a bank and Neeva is the driver. They get away with very little money and get caught shortly.<br /><br />Neeva has put a plan together to get Dell and Berner to Canada with her friend to be taken care of by her friend's brother, Arthur Remlinger. Berner runs away before the plan can take effect but Dell is taken to Canada where he resides in Saskatchewan for several years.<br /><br />It is a puzzle to Dell why he is there as Arthur pays little attention to him and he exists by doing odd jobs here and there in the little town. He is looked after primarily by Charles Quarters, a great freak of literature. Charles is a dwarf-like man of great strength who likes to wear make-up from time to time and has an underlying personality that houses great rage.<br /><br />Most of the story takes place in the 1960's during the time that Dell is in Saskatchewan. The bank robbery itself takes place in 1960.<br /><br />This is a wonderful novel filled with characters that I felt like I could reach out and touch, they were so real and true to life. The actions that emanated from the plot were right-on perfect and took my breath away.<br /><br />I've only read one book by Richard Ford and that was many years ago. I plan to read his other novels as it is rare that I run into a writer of such brilliant caliber.bber for many years. Dell scouts out a bank and Neeva is the driver.

B00729GQ0A|2.0|I tried this book on the strength of the reviews.  5'ish stars over several hundred reviewers usually indicates strong potential, but in this case I guess I'm in the minority; I just didn't \\"get\\" this book. The author's take on vampire / werewolf / witch was novel and held my interest for the first third of the book, but I just couldn't understand the romance.  Maybe it was just me, but the middle of the book seemed to consist of a guy alternate between professing his undying love for the female protagonist and explaining why such a love could never be.  Hot, cold, hot, cold; it turned me off to the rest of the story, because I wanted her to kick his schizophrenic ass to the curb.  Ultimately, I couldn't take it any more and stopped reading about 2/3 of the way through the book.<br /><br />I recommend caution with this title.  It's not terrible, and my distaste is a subjective one, so look more deeply into the reviews to try and determine this book's compatibility with your reading style.
B007MU85D0|5.0|When I first heard Sigh No More by Mumford and Sons a couple of years ago, I was blown away. Since then I had not heard any new album that compared to it until I bought My Head is An Animal. This album as a whole is amazing, and not only has some great single type songs but is coherent as a full album. The singers are very good storytellers and do an excellent job of transporting the listener to different places in each one of their songs. Get this album, you won't regret it.<br /><br />My favorite songs are: Little Talks, King and Lionheart, and Dirty Paws.

B005UG542S|5.0|[[ASIN:B005O30Y5Y Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (Movie-Only Edition + UltraViolet Digital Copy) [Blu-ray]]] I have Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 also. I enjoyed watching them very much. This time, I'm going to watch them together at one time, i believe i'll enjoy The Deathly Hallows movies much better this way.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|I really liked this movie.  Its very dark, violent trip through a post-apocalyse America where the survivors can be just as dangerous as the vampires. The whole movie has a gritty realism to it that really grabs onto you and keeps your attention. Rent it, you won't be disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have heard reviews on this series both before, during, and after I read it. I personally liked it; in fact I read all three books twice.<br /><br />The story line wasn't too complicated, and it kept you wanting to turn \\"just one more page\\" before you set it down to do something else (like make supper).<br /><br />My daughter is \\"not\\" a reader, but was concerned that once she started reading it 'she' couldn't put it down either. I believe this is the first novel 'let alone series' she has read in over a decade.<br /><br />Great series!
1400063515|1.0|I'm about halfway through this book and am still searching for an inkling of what the denouement and grand insight will be!  I keep reminding myself that I shouldn't let the author's feeble attempts at cuteness, insufferable  narcissism and repeated ad hominem attacks stand in the way of my learning something from him...but I'm still hoping.  Most of what I've read thus far falls in the category: If you already knew it, you didn'need tthis, and if you didn't already know it you won't learn it here, e.g., the discussion on what fractals are.<br /><br />So far, I learned that he has discovered that there are very low probability events that may come with very large impact. WOW! And that some of these events have not yet even been thought of.  WOW!  And that there are distributions other than Gaussian and fractal.  WOW!  And that the word \\"monstrous\\", always used in its secondary meaning, irritatingly occurs about a dozen times in only the first half of the book.<br /><br />Sometimes even people I agree with embarrass me by the stridency of their argument or their intemperate tone.  Yes, there are pompous academics and stuffy accountants and economists (In a 50-year career in physics I've even run into a couple of US like that.) but to read repeated diatribes against them from someone so hypocritical and full of himself as Taleb is just plain offensive.<br /><br />It's only my innate compulsiveness that makes me continue reading this book and not just hit the DELETE button (if there is one) on my Kindle.
B000PFUAO6|3.0|I have to say this is the first Dream Theater album I've heard that I was disappointed in.  The songs seem to be written to be much more \\"approachable\\" than their past albums.<br /><br />For example, Foresaken sounds like it could have been written by any modern rock band and receive regular radio play.  It's an approachable, predictable song that's easy to crank up, but is just as easily forgotten.  The best track on this album is really Dark Eternal Night, which sounds like it came from Train of Thought.  While the rest of the tracks are not bad, I just feel like they suffer from being more of what I'd call \\"mainstream rock.\\"  It's not what I expect from Dream Theater.<br /><br />The \\"epic\\" track on this one, in the presence of enemies (pt 1 and 2) really doesn't do it for me.  I see where they were going with it, but it's just not very musically interesting to me.  It's not really bad, just not very interesting.<br /><br />The \\"AA song\\" on this album also falls flat.  For me, what kills repentance is the talking section.  It works in some songs, but here it feels forced.  It feels like Portnoy was trying too hard to make a song about something rather than make a song that was good.<br /><br />This is the Dream Theater album in my collection that has the least rotation in my CD Player.  In fact, I'm not sure I've even listened to it at all in the past year or so.

Watch [[ASIN:B002RVZV9U It Might Get Loud [Blu-ray]]] where 2 legendary guitarist (Jimmy Paige of Led Zeppelin and The Edge of U2)are blown away at the sounds this country boy can make, even when using old cheap guitars. In fact, everyone do yourselves a favor and watch this:  [...]    BUY THIS AND YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT. LET JACK THE RIPPER GRAB HOLD AND CLEANSE YOUR SOUL!
B007HO392S|1.0|I bought this expecting fine songs and beautiful singing from Carrie Underwood.  Instead I received some slick schlock from the studio that doesn't really even sound like her voice - more studio wizardry!! Did a hip-hop\\" producer play with the dials for her vocal?<br /><br />Don't waste your money.  I did not finish any of the songs as there was absolutely nothing to pull me in.  I should have sampled tracks before buying, but I relied on her previous albums which were excellent.
B002LLE3PY|4.0|I was very excited to hear the remix of Lizard, since the sound quality of the original was pretty awful, and I know it's now possible to clean tracks up in a way that wasn't possible before the advent and maturation of digital technologies. For the most part, Steven Wilson has done an incredible job, and just the fuller sound of the drums alone is worth the cost of the purchase.<br /><br />However, if you've listened to this album as many times as I have, be prepared for a few things to be different. A few sounds are completely missing from the stereo mix (although they are still included in the 5.1). This may be a deliberate choice to keep the stereo mix from getting too cluttered.<br /><br />One change that I don't understand at all is that there is a completely different bass take used in the lion's share of the \\"Bolero - A Peacock's Tale\\" section of the title track. Not only are a few lines missing that the brain expects to hear, but there are mistakes and missed notes in this take; it's clearly an earlier, inferior take.<br /><br />I fully realize I sound like the Comic Book Guy from The Simpsons when I whine about what is, in the grand scheme of things, a relatively negligible detail. That's always been one of my favorite parts of the album, though, so I'm a little sad that it doesn't have the bass line I expected. (Note: I'm well aware that there is also a version with a bass line by Tony Levin; this is clearly an alternate Gordon Haskell take, though.)<br /><br />This quibble notwithstanding, it's exciting to hear the album in such clear, punchy, well-defined sound.
B00723NWJE|1.0|Every single song sounds the same - lame!!  Her voice is played with.  Nothing on the entire album jumps out at you and makes you think, \\"Okay, I like this song!\\"  If you buy this thinking it's the wonderful vocals of the Norah Jones (along with songs that grab you) showing growth since her past LP's, you will be majorly disappointed.  Do not waste your money.  Her reputation made me buy before sampling.  Don't be fooled as well.
0345529057|5.0|I have not read them yet, but the books look wonderful. They arrived in perfect condition, and when I got them I leafed through to make sure the pages were all correct and there was not a printing mistake, as a previous review had said. I am very happy with my purchase and cannot wait to start reading!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's a genre that doesn't often make its way in the mainstream, thus, the appeal.  However, I think this book is incredibly overrated and its success is due largely, if not entirely, to word of mouth.  I would say that this book's greatest downfall is, well, the writing. The narrator's voice (Anastasia) is both inconsistent throughout and incongruent with that of a present-day 20-something girl.  I don't know any 20-somethings that say, \\"Oh my\\" or \\"Er . . .\\"  The steamy scenes and dialogue got so redundant that I actually started skipping pages towards the end of the book. The author did do a nice job at times of playing out the mutual manipulation between Christian and Ana in their efforts to \\"unwittingly\\" lead each other further and further toward what each other wanted. All in all, a lot of hype for a few pages here and there of decent storytelling.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the book(s) because at the end of the day it is what we all want, Lust, Desire, Sex and ....LOVE.
B005HSL626|4.0|I've had this game for a while and it is fun. Now I have unlocked almost all the extras and other than for when I am really bored, it virtually never gets played.

0062060554|4.0|If you like a good thriller but don't enjoy gory details, this is the book for you.<br /><br />The main character is Christine, a woman that after a severe trauma has lost her ability to form new memories and lost some of the old ones - so every morning when she wakes up, she has forgotten what happened the day before and the last thing she remembers happened some 20 years before.<br /><br />The book is written in the first person, so we see everything through Christine's eyes. The writer does a fantastic job of making the reader feel one with the character, which makes the story more intense. The book starts with Christine waking up in the morning and not recognizing the room she is in, and then we see how her husband helps her understand her situation every single day when she wakes up, and how she copes with finding things out for the first time every day. The whole experience is very unnerving, and it becomes more so as Christine starts noticing details that make her wonder if there is more to her memory loss that her husband might lead her to believe.<br /><br />I couldn't stop reading this book - I kept telling myself I'd take a break as soon as things settles a bit, but there  was always a hint of mystery and suspense even when there wasn't a major cliff hanger, so there isn't really a good place to stop!<br /><br />I saw [[ASIN:B00003CXZ4 Memento]] a few years ago, and while I liked the premise, I didn't like the movie. This book is much, much better!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I have but one regret about this set. There is no commentary offered on the extraordinary \\"Reichenbach Fall\\" episode.

B007R3AZNK|5.0|For his tenth studio album as a solo artist (and his 13th overall in the past 12 years), Joe Bonamassa and producer Kevin Shirley returned to Las Vegas, the site of their original collaboration (on 2006's \\"You and Me\\"). Seven of the eleven songs on the album were recorded in Vegas, at Studio at the Palms.  The other four were recorded in Los Angeles. Aside from bassist Carmine Rojas, who plays on the four LA tracks, the musicians are not from his touring band, but rather an impressive collection of guest stars. Aerosmith's Brad Whitford and his 17-year-old son Harrison, Blondie Chaplin, and veteran session man Pat Thrall contribute on guitar. They are joined by Arlan Schierbaum on piano and organ, Michael Rhodes on bass, and Anton Fig on drums and percussion. Doug Henthorn contributes backing vocals, and producer Shirley even gets in on the act, performing on guitar, tambourine, toy piano (!), and (of course) cowbell. Joe handles the lead vocals on all the tracks except for the final one, where Aussie Jimmy Barnes takes the spotlight.<br /><br />Joe describes the album as \\"a return to the thing I love most: the Blues.\\"  It is certainly that, although this is blues filtered through Joe's British-tinged sensibilities. If you prefer your blues to rock, Joe is your kind of guy.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Dislocated Boy,\\" an up-tempo Bonamassa original that \\"wrote itself,\\" according to Joe.  Next up is a cover of blues legend Robert Johnson's \\"Stones in My Passway,\\" which features a soulful vocal and a chunky, driving 12-string electric guitar.  The album's title track, another Bonamassa original, shifts things into ballad mode, albeit a ballad with a powerhouse chorus based on a song fragment Joe had stored in his head for more than a decade. The lyrics, about a troubled relationship, are evocative, and Joe's voice has a wistful quality that marks this as one of his best performances. Understandably, he has been featuring this song as encore material during his current tour. The next track, a cover of Howlin' Wolf's \\"Who's Been Talking\\" is introduced by a clip of the blues master himself talking about what he'd like to hear from his drummer, and Bonamassa's version amusingly begins with exactly what Wolf described. This song has also been featured on the current tour's set list. Next up is a rollicking, Chicago-style cover of Willie Dixon's \\"I Got All You Need,\\" followed by the slow, soulful burn of Bernie Marsden's \\"A Place in My Heart.\\"<br /><br />Bonamassa doesn't just cover venerable blues masters, of course. \\"Lonely Town, Lonely Street\\" is a rock-inflected take on a Bill Withers tune, and is the album's longest track. It is followed by \\"Heavenly Soul,\\" a Bonamassa original flavored with a bit of mandolin and some savory Hammond organ work by Schierbaum to go along with some of Joe's most scintillating guitar. Next up is \\"New Coat of Paint,\\" which deftly marries the wry storytelling of songwriter Tom Waits with Bonamassa's guitar heroics. Then comes Buddy Miller's \\"Somewhere Trouble Don't Go,\\" a driving, British blues-rock take on what was originally a gospel-style song. Finally, there is the smouldering passion of \\"Too Much Ain't Enough Love,\\" featuring the raw vocal style of Jimmy Barnes, the song's co-author.<br /><br />Bonamassa's last five solo albums have hit No. 1 on Billboard's Blues chart; the last two (\\"Black Rock\\" and \\"Dust Bowl\\") also hit the Top Ten on the Rock chart, and the Top Forty overall. \\"Driving Towards the Daylight\\" is something of a stylistic throwback for Joe (and is intended as such), but the music sounds anything but old-fashioned, and seems likely to propel the album to equal or better its predecessors in terms of popular acclaim. Highly recommended!

B0063IH60K|3.0|Hints when stalled are helpful in learning strategies for winning. A bit too easy to just click away on the exposed deck cards rather than thinking if a move is possible. Maybe should have a penalty of a counted move for the guess.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|Great-sounding soundtrack and excellent photography, but the movie never really takes off.  I think the core problem is traceable to the book:  the author wasn't sure what he wanted to say, and that indecision makes it into the film.<br /><br />They had all the ingredients of a masterpiece here:  an offbeat film that starts off as a zany road trip but ends up as a poignant statement about a massacre.  But what statement?  The filmmakers didn't seem to know, and in the vacuum of that indecision the writer's inability to draw characters or answer questions meaningfully is thrown into bas relief.<br /><br />I'm sure those hipster filmmakers would be quick to retort that, hey man, this is deep art!  It reflects life in that life doesn't provide easy answers!  It leaves many questions unanswered, in the way life does.  Get it?  Get it?<br /><br />Sorry, but that's a cop-out.  Life is allowed to leave questions unanswered.  Art is not.<br /><br />Otherwise a writer could just fill his novel with a whole bunch of inexplicable mysteries, and whenever a reader objects that he never really arrives at satisfactory knowledge of the book's mysteries, merely reply, \\"that's because I'm echoing life, baby!\\"<br /><br />And maybe you are!  But since ANYBODY could do that, that hardly makes you a great artist.<br /><br />Great artists lead, limit, and hone.  They take the raw complexity of life and distill it.  They are a choke point, not a freeway.<br /><br />But not this film.  It simply presents a mystery and then closes up shop for the day, leaving the viewer to do all the real work.<br /><br />Cheating!
0765357151|5.0|Okay so there are a lot of reviews on \\"I Am Legend\\" but I just have to put in my two cents worth of reviewing of this book.<br /><br />This book is nowhere near anything like the movie. The book is so much more better than Will Smith's version and I was mildly surprised that this is not really a book, but a short story.  The other stories in the book are quite good too and it makes for an enjoyable read.<br /><br />As I was reading \\"I Am Legend\\" I did not know the story had ended.  It wasn't an abrupt end, it just ended if you know what I mean.  Still a really good story and I thoroughly enjoyed reading Mr. Matheson's other short stories too.  Just a bit surprised at \\"I Am Legend\\" as I was expecting a lot longer story.

0143120530|5.0|Frankly, when I started reading this book, I anticipated that it would be a pretty boring read because I couldn't imagine how a non-fiction book about the history and biology of human memory could be a fun book to read.<br /><br />I was delighted and surprised to find out that this book is loads of fun to read.  It features a cast of interesting characters, some useful tips about how to improve your own memory, and a premise that is compelling:  turning someone with an average memory into a world-class competitive memory champion in less than a year.<br /><br />Although the book is well-researched, the subject matter never seems dry.  The author presents it with lots of humor and anecdotes that had me chuckling out loud.

B0045EJY90|1.0|When you order the P650, beware of the misleading product description. The \\"Optional\\" Ipod tray does not come with the unit and it is impossible to get it from Teac. I contacted Teac via email and was told they don't sell directly to the public. They did tell me that they would sell me a cradle if I contacted Amazon and asked them to order it. The problem is, Amazon wouldn't/couldn't order it for me. It should be CLEARLY stated that the cradle doesn't come with the unit and that it can't be ordered. At least you have the option of buying it elsewhere instead of going through the hassle of either trying to purchase the cradle from another vendor or returning the player to Amazon. Very disappointed in both Teac and Amazon on this one.<br /><br />BTW: The unit itself is respectable but not great. No stars for all the hassle.
B0083EW97W|4.0|Well, we can be sure now, john is on some big time heavy weed trips, in order to make this album he had to be high.... really high.<br />Some good songs for sure, some really not so good songs. He really wanted to sound like he was recording this from 40 years ago. Hell, with all the weed he smoked he may have really thought he was. Shame really, he had some really great stuff coming out, now not so much. Three star album, only gave him 4 simply because He is John Mayer, that wont happen next time.

1450400957|5.0|As can be seen from my Amazon reviews, my most popular choices of books are about working out. Not because I don't know how--that I know. But I love the knowledge of expert advise.<br /><br />This book is actually one of my favorites.<br /><br />I think the reviewer who said the first 50 pages were about why you should workout must be reviewing another book or, worse, they are a competitor to this book...I don't say that sarcastically, I seriously think they have a different book because page 4 and 5 are \\"Advantages of working out at home\\"which is the prologue only and simply a motivational list. Pages 1-3 are table of contents, pages 6-7 are the chapter list and then pages 8-256 are chock full of workouts. (so that is very odd to say the first 50 pages are about why you should workout at home. Wrong book.)<br /><br />And I mean \\"chock full\\". I typically prefer a DVD rather than a book except for in this case. Each page shows full color graphics...by that I mean a sketch like you see on the cover showing what muscles are being worked...very helpful, a photograph of someone well built (so you can actually see the muscular definition) doing each step of the rep, written explanation, and sometimes back and front view if important.<br /><br />I actually am amazed at the detail in this. If you wish to get into strength training or if you are an expert who wants to learn new moves or be sure you are doing it right, this is simply a great book.<br /><br />Why does it even help an expert? It gives you variations you have never seen before. Like using a band with your dumbbells on some moves or changing things up a bit, using a chair for some moves so that you work muscles you would not have otherwise, targeting certain areas (do you want to build up your chest? Here are certain moves just for that. Want to work your biceps? Here are moves just for that...)<br /><br />If you have a weight bench it shows you how to do moves on that, but if you don't it also shows you how you can use the edge of your bed instead. This is very handy as it takes those with lots of equipment in their home to be able to use it or those who don't---don't miss out either.<br /><br />I have to admit seeing in color the muscles I'm working are a motivator...rather than just mindlessly doing reps. Sometimes it surprised me...A rep I knew was working a certain muscle, I didn't realize was working another one for example.<br /><br />I can seriously say I use this book more than any other in my library. I use it every few days for strength training and I am working more muscles than I EVER have before at a gym or with workout DVDS and doing the reps better.<br /><br />You need very little to get in shape...This book and a good set of dumbbells (and optionally a band) is, in my opinion, the perfect tool...regardless of your current ability.<br /><br />Pros will learn more, novices will learn everything.can use the edge of your bed instead.

B006PTL1QM|4.0|There's a distant clinical feeling to this piece that keeps the audience at arm's length and therefore might work against it on some level. The focus is upon Dr. Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen) and Dr. Carl Jung (played by Michael Fassbender) shortly before World War I takes place and Jung is helping a disturbed patient named Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightly) who later becomes his lover for experimental sexual pleasures and even later a psychotherapist with her own views. There seems to be a strong push and pull feel between rationalistic psychology of Freud and intuitive psychology of Jung with some subdued conflict between the two personalities. On the whole it's an interesting look at three historical people back in the day but I've heard there are some historical inaccuracies or improper delivery of certain theories. An end narration of what happened to each of these three people follows at the end of the picture.<br /><br />As the topic is narrowly focused and not \\"high concept\\" it will have a \\"boutique\\" style audience, I suspect, but still a good movie if you find the details interesting. Minor nudity, people. The screenplay was adapted by writer Christopher Hampton from his 2002 stage play The Talking Cure, which was based on the 1993 non-fiction book by John Kerr, A Most Dangerous Method: The story of Jung, Freud, and Sabina Spielrein. The budget for this picture was $15M and it made a bit over $27M at the Box Office.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; THEMATIC FOCUS DELIVERIES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: mid May 2012

B002MQYOFW|5.0|THIS IS AN AWESOME SERIES. COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN. I'M ON THE SECOND BOOK. MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDSON HAS ALREADY READ ALL THREE BOOKS. IT JUST KEEPS YOUR SUSPENSE UP THE WHOLE TIME AND KEEPS YOU THINKING AND GUESSING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN OR MIGHT HAPPEN. ITS A SERIES AS GOOD AS HARRY POTTER AND TWILIGHTS. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED AT ALL.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|I am 15 and became a Rush fan at 13. In those two years I have learned just about every thing there is to know about rush. In this album they finally get back to there hard rockin guts after the soft high-sinth 80s and still soft Presto and roll the bones albums. The first song Animate starts out raw and hard and has a great drive to it. Next Stick it Out, yes not what you think it means, is even harder with deep guitar and bass. Cut to the Chase has a little Led Zepplin sound after the guitar solo. Nobodys Hero, a beautiful melodic song, Between the sun and moon as a simple feel to it but is a great tune. Next I LOVE Alien Shore. Starts off with an AWSOME guitar, bass, and drums very hevy and raw one of their all time best. Speed of love calm soothing song. Dont realy get Double agent youl see what im talking about. love Leave that thing alone and the rest. It is one of my favorite Rush Albums, a must have.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I never played Solitaire before. Seriously! I was able to learn quickly after my husband instructed me the 1st time. Definitely needed instructions but couldn't find them with this app. That being said, I have been playing for the past week. Really enjoying it. I highly recommend this app.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|AWESOME app- if it would work. Has great color, framing, crop, and extra options such as stickers and text. Doesn't mess up the uploading from my gallery, and is one of the best editors I've seen on Fire.<br />...Except for one thing. When I try to colorize the photo, such as turning parts of it black and white or leaving parts normal or different colors, the photo goes black. Yes, I can run my finger over the black photo, but I cant see the photo! When I say, 'done',  the black disappears and I can see what I've attempted to color. I've tried many different theories and setups from friends but to no prevail. It still doesn't work right. This part is jacked up, but otherwise easiest and most optional photo editor I've had.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|As a regular erotic reader, I held out from reading 50 for months.  Boy was I glad I did! I read the trilogy and all I can say is really? People need to get familiar with true erotica writers like Sienna Mynx,Theodora Taylor, Shayla Black, and Lena Matthews to name a few.<br />I did like Christian with all his issues, Anastasia on the other hand gave me a headache. Yes she is young but really?<br />The first book was tolerable, but the second and third were repetitive and annoying, unffortunately I got sucked into finishing,the books and had to finish the trilogy.<br />I can't understand what the big deal is about the series, erotica authors have been around for a long time, by far I have read better in depth books. I don't understand why this book stands out to so many to make it a best seller.<br />Yes Cinderella got her prince, for that is what this story is, but 3 books of merry go round? Please. The final book seemed so rushed,I felt sorry for people who actually bought it! The only reason I gave to stars was that the premise was good, and the sex in book 1 was delicious, otherwise just a waste of my time.<br />Kudos Ms.James in getting people to enjoy a genre that has been considered \\"dirty,\\" however there are better books out there.<br />I am one of the few, I guess who is not on the 50 bandwagon, and so happy with that.
0345803485|1.0|Who reads this kind of garbage? Worse, who writes this kind of garbage?<br /><br />It is the worst kind of bodice-ripper. A beautiful virgin, a mysterious wealthy older man....are women really so stupid, shallow, and self-hating as to enjoy this kind of ridiculous nonsense?<br /><br />For masochists of the worst kind only...literary masochists.
B0063IH60K|5.0|app Never crashes. Has a lot of options and really satisfies the needs of a solitaire player. Lots of fun.
1851775722|4.0|This book has lovely, detailed, close-up photos of a number of historical clothing items. It is wonderful for studying details and getting things just right! I love it!
0307951529|5.0|They say good things come in small packages and with Chris Guillebeau's book the $100 Startup it certainly is a good thing in just 285 pages!<br /><br />I think everyone at least once in their life wants to go into business and what the $100 Startup shows you, is how easy it actually is to start. All businesses showcased in the book were started by your average everyday person, no 'gurus' just people with a passion and most with less than $100 to get them going.<br /><br />This book proves that you can fulfill your dream of being your own boss. Each of the business startups give you practical tips for achieving success and one of the constant ideas throughout the book is to \\"just start\\".<br /><br />I loved the simplicity of this book and would recommend it to anyone who has the dream of having their own business.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Lots of fun, works great on my Fire. Spent two hours before shutting it off and going to bed. Couldn't put it down. Great game at reasonable price. Want it for my PC also.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Ms James is a good writer.  I look forward to reading some of what she writes in the future.  This trilogy should have been reduced by 2/3rds. All the REVELANT info could have been condensed.  This was our book club selection at work.  We all agreed the sex segments fast became boreing...imagine! We were all so happy to finish these...just TOOOO much of a good thing.  The story line was a \\"happily ever after.\\"  nice for a change.  But I really would not recommend this trilogy unless someone has lots of time on his/her hands and is not a guardian of what he spends it on.
B000UYJR7I|5.0|great story, that really hit my heart.  the cast choosen was perfect. i loved it. i would recomend to everyone to watch.  this is my second time watching.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|As the final installment of a dynamic trilogy, it exceeds expectation by remaining fresh with key characters and the development of new characters.<br />The continued journey of Lizbeth is frightening and fascinating as it weaves to a satisfying conclusion.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|I got this processor for my new pc. I wanted a low power pc, so i got the FX4100. It runs just fine, I had no problem when installing it. I was a little worried because some people had problems with BIOS out of date in asus M5A for this new processors. Mine was reconized inmediately in my ASUS M5A board, so i did not have to update my bios. I'm happy with the product, i was'nt looking for a high end processor, so this was perfect for me. It has 4 cores and 45 watt consumption(I think... but nos sure). DDR3 compatible. Put 2 corsair 1600 cards with no problem. I recomend this processor for those people that doesn't need much horsepower in their pc's.
B007DIQAXI|5.0|I've been listening to these guys since Summer 2011 and finally got to see them live at SXSW 2012. It was amazing! They are a great live band. Yes, they have drawn comparisons to Mumford & Sons and Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros, however their Icelandic accents are very noticeable in their tracks. I think this is a unique feature of the group. You will not regret purchasing this album.
B0002HWQEE|5.0|Our little grandson is finally crawling forward (instead of his usual backward propulsion) to catch the little doggies tail! His three year old sister pulls and he crawls - great fun for the siblings, while the doting parents and grandparents cheer them both on. All Brio products are soooo very durable!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I haven't had any problems or glitches since I downloaded the app. So it not only works fine but its a pretty addictive game and it looks graphically pleasing as far as cartoons go. Two thumbs up!
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I recently learned about William Wilberforce's fight against the slave trade in England in one of my political science classes and became interested in this movie. I was not disappointed. The acting is superb and the cast is excellent. A very well-done, polished movie.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is cool. so far I really really enjoy it. action is fun and fast paced. definite recommend it to others
B007V2UGPE|5.0|At times it can be choppy as posted in other reviews but usually it recovers in the next 5 sec(kindle fire). When i say choppy I mean it slows down just a weee bit. But still overall fun. I recommend this awesome game to anyone who enjoys time consuming fun just like any other glu mobile game!
B00542X2DQ|2.0|Disappointing! After noticing major errors just reading some of the recipes but fortunately before I tried to make any of them (for example, the chocolate buttercream variations direct you to add the chocolate- or coffee-flavored butter to the \\"yolks,\\" and of course there are no egg yolks in the recipe), I checked out the reviews on the book. It seems to be riddled with errors. So I went to download the errata. Hmm, the one on the publisher's website is different from the one on the bakery's website, and neither is dated or versioned. Neither addresses the yolks issue, either, even though the buttercream recipe is on both of them (one changes the temperature to which you cook the syrup but the other does not). I checked out the Kindle version from my library and I don't find any edition info in it. Apparently the fourth (fourth?!?!) edition is supposed to have more fixes. I won't be holding my breath, or adding this to my cookbook collection, sadly.
B0080XN3C6|5.0|I've been following Kimbra for a while, ever since a friend told me about \\"Settle Down\\" several months ago. In anticipation of her US album release, I got my fix by listening to it on Grooveshark, and fell in immediate love. I probably listened to it 4 times a week. Anyway, the Deluxe edition doesn't disappoint, as it included the songs I knew, as well as newer songs. Kimbra is one of the few true musical talents left in the industry, as evidenced by her live videos at Sing Sing Studios (seriously, go YouTube them and prepare to be amazed). She's also a talented lyricist. I've seen her genre listed as pop, but it's difficult to peg her down, as she runs the gamut of soul, to R&B, to rock. My current favorite song is Come Into My Head, both for vocals, musicality, and lyrics. Her crowning piece, however, is Plain Gold Ring (Live). I dare you to listen and not be blown away.
0446572993|5.0|The characters are original, well-developed and very interesting.  The storylines are also original and they move along smartly.  I didn't get much else done, but I finished without sleeping.  It's that gripping.  Contrary to what others have written, all the loose ends are tied up in a plausible way.<br /><br />I hope Will Robie returns in more novels.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Solid app has everything i need for weather. Easy to use. My while family uses this app and we have no complaints about it.
0345803485|1.0|I fell into conformity with all the hype on this book. Complete waste of time and money. I honestly haven't finished it and don't intend to. I'm 80% done with the book and find myself so repulsed by the content that I'd give anything to erase the complete crap written in this top seller.<br /><br />It wasn't the repetitive and dull sex scenes that left me in disgust...although it was enough to put me to sleep. It was the content of the characters' so called loving relationship. Grey appears abusive, jealous, controlling, manipulative and he stalks her continuously. If she doesn't behave he punishes her......hmmmm sounds a bit abusive doesn't it? Yet this behavior is condoned and labeled sexy??? Really? I have a HUGE issue with that and it makes me sick. I really hope the hype dies soon.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This seem like a dum game, but it turned out to be realy fun. Thanks. It can also be quite addictive. Were did all my time go?
B003WWZ148|4.0|Odds are if you are buying this, you know what you are getting, and you are looking for it in specific. That being said, this is a great Cash album, one of my favorite. The quality of the vinyl is great, and the sound quality very good.<br /><br />Glad I picked it up.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I COULD NOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.  THE SCENES ARE AWESOME AND IS FULL OF ACTION PACK SCENES.  I RECOMMEND THAT EVERYONE SHOULD ADD THIS DVD/BLUERAY TO THEIR MOVIE COLLECTION. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED AND WILL BE WATCHING THIS MOVIE TIME AND TIME AGAIN. DON'T FORGET TO ADD THE POPCORN!
B00026WU7I|5.0|Given this is such an important album on the rock pantheon it gets SACD, 5.1 but sonically while vastly superior to the original CD it does not make the quantum leap that it should. I wore out my vinyl copy of this album and hope for more care from the Sony on this very important album. Perhaps one day there will be a remaster of the remaster.
0743298039|5.0|1) I was on the edge of my seat. 2)  I didn't want it to end. 3) I totally get it, when someone calls a book a masterpiece. This one truly is.
B00026WU9Q|5.0|The Dylan remasters are incredible, SACD, 5.1 as bonuses. Sonically this is how Dylan should always sounded on CD. It's good that Sony finally realised the importance of this.
B005KN5AES|5.0|It's sad to hear the bad news about the founder and lead guitar player of this great band. I just recommend this album for all the heavy metal fans, people who appreciates to hear music with structure and effort.
0345803485|4.0|* Based entirely upon my non-scientific calculations. And I have a Spoiler in my review.<br /><br />This book (and trilogy, as a whole) is a trip! And, the book isn't nearly as bad (or nearly as wonderful) as the reviews paint it. It has definite merits and I enjoyed it.<br /><br />Why the reviews aren't very reliable:<br /><br />1. This book is not well written. It just isn't. If it had a great editor, the book would be better, but, not the same (I haven't decided if the author's pure enthusiasm makes up for the poor writing. It is a draw for me, personally.) It is repetitive, inconsistent, sometimes ridiculous, weirdly foreign/formal, and outlandish. You want Jonathan Franzen- buy Jonathan Franzen. This is clearly a very young (in career terms) author. It is not in the running for the National Book Award. Hype does not equal artful fiction.<br /><br />2. Genre, Genre, Genre. This book is a romance novel. If Stephanie Laurens, Nora Roberts, and Lisa Kleypas make your skin crawl, this book is pure poison ivy. Also, this book is erotica (albeit light-erotica). If you can't take some book sex, do not read this book. At least a full 1/3 of the book and the trilogy are sex scenes. I would rate the sex at about a 5 on a scale of 1-10 of uncomfortably icky sex based mainly upon the frequency. (Disclaimer- I'm also a bit of a prude. For example, I can't read Laurell K. Hamilton's later Anita Blake books and Merry Gentry books. I stay away from most anything labeled erotica unless I know the author. Or it is an enormous cultural phenomenon, apparently.)<br /><br />3. The BDSM thing. If you expect your book BDSM to comply with actual BDSM, don't read this book. The apparently knowledgeable reviews make it very clear that the author is a BDSM light-weight (as if that were a VERY BAD THING!)It is fiction- the author created the universe that suited her story. In this book, the hero is a BDSM- \\"sexpert\\"-badass. Hey, willing suspension of disbelief, and all that. To my mind, a majority of the BDSM stuff was there just to lend some verisimilitude to the whole story. We hear more about the tools of BDSM than they are actually used in the story. All props- in more ways than one. In fact, I think the author makes the connection for the reader, the BDSM is merely a mask for the real story.<br /><br />4. Professional Jealousy. Genre readers are the most proprietorial readers in the known universe. Too many reviews make sure to mention that the sex isn't sexy enough, that Ms. James is obviously unqualified to write for the BDSM community, that she isn't nearly as good as their favorite author, and that her run-away success irritates them profoundly. Whatevs. As Ms. James should say to them, \\"Laters, baby.\\" And then she should go out to dinner with whatever hottie plays Christian in the movie. My favorite are the outraged readers who yell that this was once fan-fic from a Twilight. If they knew that, why are they outraged that they didn't like it? Frankly, I hate Twilight and that was a downer for me but I found it didn't really impact me once the book began to stand on its own.<br /><br />Now, my review:<br /><br />I liked the book(s).<br /><br />Ms. James is pretty witty. Granted, you have to wade through a lot of sex and repetition, but the humor is there and it is genuine and creative. Seriously, I'm gonna use \\"Laters, baby\\" just to see who recognizes the line. And, then, I'll accuse them of reading pornography just to freak them out.<br /><br />The email exchanges were the heart of the novel. That was the realistic progression of the relationship between two characters that made sense and resonated. And, a nice little nod to \\"Bridget Jones\\".<br /><br />Christian. The tortured hero. I prefer a good \\"Darcy\\", but, Christian's \\"Heathcliff\\" was not bad. If you read any Harlequin's, then Christian is a very familiar character archetype.<br /><br />Christian's tortured past actually was a tortured past. And, I think Ms. James handled it rather interestingly. She was responsible and sympathetic- and very realistic. I thought his confusion(?) over the molestation was interesting and added a layer of reality to a book that was, overall, a fantasy. He had a better, deeper characterization than Ana.<br /><br />Ana. She is a bit of a cipher- which does work. I have many criticisms about Ana. If I knew anyone like her, I would bitch-slap her into next Friday for being so dangerously naive. There were scenes where Ana was such a moron that it brought me straight out of the story- but, then, those scenes usually made me laugh at the book and not, entirely, in a bad way. ***SPOILER *** For example, when a guy you barely know follows you to work to buy rope, cable ties, and tape- offer to sell him a 55 gallon drum to dispose of the body and some bleach for those pesky forensics. Do not call him back. Do not go out for coffee. Do not fly to Seattle with him. ***Spoiler ENDS***<br /><br />This is a relationship book. In my mind, the real resonance comes from starting and negotiating a difficult relationship. Christian is messed up which presents a steep learning curve to zero-experience Ana. But, then, everyone has a difficult relationship (not necessarily romantic) that provided the emotional wallop that the book delivers. And, the wallop is there if you have an open mind and can overlook the sex, the writing, and Ana.<br /><br />Finally, my most damning criticism: ***SPOiLER*** I just cannot believe that a 22 year old American girl with a boyfriend she nicknames \\"Fifty\\" does not once call him \\"Fiddy\\"? ***SPOILER ENDS***estingly.

B007UXSPK2|5.0|A Great Movie that met all my expectations, Tom Cruise is always at his best and delivers a great movie everytime.
1469984202|3.0|The story is not fun. That is evedent at the onset. This may well be a study of human nature; but wow, is it a dark statement!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I think this app is really great and reliable I use it for school every morning. it really gives the right temperature and goes along the day telling you if it rains or if its sunny.
B002NAYF9W|5.0|Awesome book. You will get completely swept up into the story. After reading the book you will also enjoy the well-done movie. Book arrived as described (gently used, moderate wear)
0756655307|5.0|good info.  i like how they have the info for the good guys/ bad guys.  over 400 pages.  so many characteristic a lot of the marvel characters i never heard of before i got this book.  also tells you about there friends girl friends family.  worth getting.
067940581X|5.0|Yet another charming & beautifully published book. If you have enjoyed her other writings you will like this one as well. Thank you, Jane Austen, for your legacy! Book arrived as described (brand new, perfect condition)
B00000G3PA|5.0|a great movie one of my favorite disaster movies that i have seen.  this 1997 movie is one of those that could happen.  see bruce willis owns his own oil drilling area and NASA has him to go to NASA latter he says i go i choose my team.  then that is how his drilling crew go.  see the way that destroy the meteor is by drilling it to a certin point.
0345803485|4.0|This book is a little outside the genre that I normally read.  However, at the recommendation and the media buzz, I thought I would give it a read.  I LOVE THE BOOKS.  I have just finished the final book in the series and loved them all.  The author has a nice way of keeping you glued to the page and if you think you will just finish one more chapter stop reading for the night, forget it.  This is a mature book, no doubt about.  I would not allow my teenage daughter to read it nor would I encourage my elderly aunt to read the books.  When all is said and done it was a great read and I have recommended it to several friends.
B0001932ZA|5.0|just like the title.  if you have never heard of the running man a great movie.  the point of the movie is these three guys brake out of i believe it is prison you only see it for at most 10 min.  anyway they escape go there ways and arnold goes to his brothers old apartment and see's a lady.  they both have no idea who each other are.  later arnold and the lady were at the air port and blew his cover.  i remember in the way beginning of the movie there is a crowd of people in the streets.  his bosses wanted him to kill every one from the helicopter but he refused.  then the other guys in the copter knocked him out and that is how he gets to prison.  long story short see it is a show in the movie that has convicts to kinda give them 1 more chance.  them at the end every one finds out that he was not a bad person.  i suggest this to you. his 2 friends from prison both die.  see the way they were there was the show host is the law in a way.  i hope that you love this movie bunches.
B002ZG997C|3.0|First of all, I don't usually like post-apocalyptic movies, but this one seemed different.  Although this movie does have its share of violence (Denzel is awesome to watch in the fight scenes), the less obvious things about the movie, particularly the ending, is what stays with you.<br /><br />I did not think this movie was going to be something I though about for days after viewing it, but I did; mainly it was due to the fact that I wasn't sure I got the punchline in the end.<br /><br />This movie is worth seeing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it has never failed me! works all the time and I will spend hours at a time playing. recomend it to anyone who loves solitaire games. the spider solitaire and freecell work great as well!
030788743X|5.0|While I'm not a gamer (and I'm sure I missed a lot of the references in the book), I did grow up in the 80s and truly enjoyed this book.  I liked how the ending was stated at the beginning.  I really liked the characters - both their avatars and themselves.  This was a quick read and I recommend it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I almost didn't see this movie. When I first saw the trailer I thought it was just another cheesy action movie. But, when a friend told me that it was a movie based on an incredibly imaginative book written almost 100 years ago and that it had inspired many more recent sci-fi stories, I decided to check it out. I am so glad I did. This movie not only has a great story but solid performances, loveable characters, cool costumes, and awesome special effects. I never see a movie more than once in the theatre but I saw John Carter three times on the big screen. This movie is a classic and a must-have in your personal collection!
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I love Barbara Streisand. What a voice. She plays a great role. DVD itself was a great price, great quality and arrived on time.
B005LBYQ6M|4.0|Starts slow and hard to get into but your patience is rewarded with a first rate thriller to be enjoyed. I usually hate any books with so much religious overtones and background but this onebroke the mold.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|It is awesome. I love the special edition. The price and that there is always an opportunity to have no shipping charges are great. Great packaging too, both delivery packing and the case for the DVDs. The discs each have their own side instead of on top of each other.
0345803485|2.0|I was really disappointed in this book. I had heard so much about it that I was expecting a very exciting hot romance novel. I was very disappointed in the ending. I wouldn't spend money on this book if I was you but if you can borrow it and have time on your hands read it. I will not waste my money on the second book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Works great on the kindle fire. Full of fun and challenging puzzles that will keep you busy for a long time.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|How to put this??  I freaking LOVED this book.  Why?  No clue, really.  It was WAY different from anything I'd ever read, being as \\"erotica\\" and \\"bdsm\\" are not my typical genre.  Was it spectacularly written?  No.  Is it a literary masterpiece?  No.  Did I find it as controversial and shocking as all the hype I've seen/read?  No.  Perhaps I have a bit more of an open mind than most, or perhaps I am a bit warped.  Whatever the case may be, I enjoyed every page.  Well, most every page!  A couple cringe-worthy scenes, but they were the whole point of the book, after all!  While the thought of someone \\"punishing\\" me isn't my cup of tea (pun intended...if you've read the book, you'll get it), hey, as long as the people involved are of legal age and consenting then go for it!  Who's to say what consenting adults can and can not do behind closed doors?  Not me!<br /><br />**My FULL REVIEW at: solefulreader. com**<br /><br />Regardless of your opinion of this book, one AWESOME thing about it....its getting people reading!  People who don't normally read are picking up this book and that is wonderful!  Perhaps E.L. James will conceive a new generation of readers!  ;)  Haven't read it yet?  Whatcha waiting for?  Think \\"Oh, my God! No way would I read that, nor would anyone I know!\\"?  Weeelll, hate to burst your bubble, but...with 3 million copies sold, I'm willing to bet you DO know someone who has read it, whether they admit to it, or not is the question!
0345803485|5.0|I love these books. I read them all in one weekend. I was hearing about them alot on the internet & tv and decided to check it out. The BDSM intrigued me, and the fact it started out as Twilight fan fiction (not really a huge fan of that franchise). But what REALLY got me to keep reading was Ana & Christian's emotional relationship, not physical. Especially in the 2nd & 3rd book. I'm 22 and my mom and my GRANDMA want to read these books, even after telling them how explicit they are. I will have to come back and leave their thoughts.<br /><br />Even though I'm in love with these books, I do agree some parts are repetitive. I even got bored with some of the sex and skipped ahead. I can only read \\"my sex\\" so many times. The positives of these books far outweigh any negatives. Anyone who says these books encourage female submissiveness and physical punishment obviously has not read them at all.
B00136LS2E|5.0|This mp3 album is very nice, wonderful music and worth that price! You are encouraged to buy it if you are interested in symphony.
B005LAIGTG|2.0|In The Notebook, an old couple are struggling with her dementia which has erased her memory of their passionate love story. Her devoted husband attempts to rekindle the spark with a diary she wrote describing their young love.  In flashbacks, we see Rachel McAdams playing the older woman as a young, fiery girl who is an artist, and  defies her rich, brittle mother's desires for her to attend college and marry into wealth and prestige.  Instead, she gives herself to a local poor boy, Ryan Gosling,  until they are separated by distance and parental conniving. She forgets her heart's wishes and  decides her parents' plans for her are best after all, including an engagement to a rich suitor and abandoning her art . Her lover, Ryan, meanwhile, never forgets , and plots and plans how he will be able to re-ignite their love one day by renovating a derelict house into a fabulous showplace as a monument to the lovemaking they performed there.  Gosling's smoldering passion is palpable and when you compare him to Channing Tatum's similar role in The Vow, Channing comes off looking like an amateur.  He is all hunk and no acting ability.  In The Vow, Rachel McAdams recycles her role from The Notebook, as a defiant daughter with lying, brittle parents who reclaim her from her husband after a brain injury erases her memory of their love, her art, and her parents conniving. Blah, blah, blah.<br />In The Vow, however, she loses her memory while still young and tries to remember how she got married to Channing by reading her wedding vows, written on a napkin.  An old boyfriend actually looks better to her. Also, she is not quite sure what to do with that discarded pile of clay she was once molding into something meaningful when she gave up law school to to find herself as an artist.<br />The Vow is like that discarded clay.  Everyone forgot what to do with it. The Vow's premise had promise but the execution is so flat.  Bad dialogue.  Wooden acting by Channing Tatum, bare bum and all.  Rachel McAdams who was luminous in The Notebook, faked every emotion in The Vow and just came off shrill. The plot similarities to The Notebook is a blatant rip off even if it is supposedly based on a true story.  I was bored.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Wow this thing is great!  It's so thin and light you hardly know it's there at all.  I returned my Kindle Fire in favor of a Galaxy tab 2, and I'm disappointed I can't get this case for that model.
B0046ECJBY|3.0|The first few chapters of the book were great source to understand the Chinese history and how the chinese looking at the events folding from 18th century, the \\"barbarian\\" diplomatic years. Then the book was purely on Chinese American diplomatic relationship with a quick look at the near past chinese leadership after mao, slightly touching the change that come with Deng.Still very good read on china and sino-american diplomatic history even i did not find the second part partuculary interesting for me.
B004EPYZV2|2.0|(Some minor plot details are revealed below)<br /><br />It's hard to know who the Mission: Impossible franchise is aimed at any more. On the face of it, this is a children's movie, with very little in terms of plot or character development to give adults anything to get their teeth into. On the other hand, there is a scene right at the start of the movie with an implied kicking to death (off screen, mercifully) of a prison guard, and people being graphically shot multiple times. It's a mark of the skewed moral compass of Hollywood these days that \\"foul\\" language is not allowed, but extreme violence? That's fine in a PG-13 movie.<br /><br />A common theme amongst most of the reviews of this film is that you need to \\"suspend disbelief\\". It is evidently possible to make a thrilling action movie that doesn't insult the intelligence of its viewers - The Bourne Ultimatum is proof of that - so why does Ghost Protocol choose to throw in such flimsy nonsense that requires everyone to forget about basic logic and the laws of physics?<br /><br />The plot, such is it is, doesn't hold up. Got your top rank movie star? Check. Throw in some exotic locations with no real reason to connect them? Check. Come up with some ridiculously implausible gadgets? Check. Job done! Who cares about a story arc? The central theme of this movie actually may be product placement, so blatant is it. I understand the reasons for product placement, but when it's so comically obvious as it is here, it takes the viewer out of the film. Canon, Dell, Apple, BMW...it's like being bludgeoned by a marketing company.<br /><br />There are so many silly scenes in this movie, I almost don't know where to begin. How about having a set of characters regroup independently in a central location, then showing that they are all wearing clothes that exactly match the dark grey shade of the walls of the room they're in? What are the chances?! How about another scene with members of the public walking by, who all - gasp!- happen to be wearing clothes that perfectly match the set design colours? Did the director think that people wouldn't notice this kind of thing? How about throwing in a giant sandstorm where people can't see see each other when they're chasing each other on foot...but can have a car chase inside the same sandstorm? Yeah, that works! Or have an item that can be tracked using \\"isotopes\\" with pinpoint accuracy from a distance of half a mile away...no matter, let's just assume that the audience is stupid, get the characters to mutter some mumbo jumbo, no-one will notice, right?<br /><br />The character writing is also paper thin. Simon Pegg's character is a Mr. Bean type moron - obviously he's there for comic relief, but it stretches credibility to breaking point when a bumbling twit is supposed to be part of the world's most highly trained secret agent team.<br /><br />Even the CGI work is often sub-par, with the CGI elements standing out like a sore thumb on a number of occasions - the camera pass over the tall building in Dubai where much of the central action takes place (the building itself is a hugely obvious render), water surface effects that look like they've come out of a computer game circa 2002, a dropped aluminium suitcase that's about as convincing as a singing goat.<br /><br />Having said all that, Ghost Protocol is not completely without merit. The scene featuring the approach of a giant sandstorm is genuinely tense, even if that tension disappears when it actually arrives. The climbing of the Burj Khalifa is very well handled. The problem is, the good parts are thinly dispersed amongst the bits that require a monumental suspension not just of disbelief, but of one's entire brain...and you know what? I'm done with suspending this much disbelief.

B007O3QC8K|5.0|Sir Simon Rattle's live recording of Bruckner's Fourth Symphony in 2006 received a mixed reception. I have myself had my reservations, ranging from mild to serious, regarding the success of some of his forays into Brahms, Strauss and Mahler, but this latest release seems to me to be the finest thing he has done with the Berlin Philharmonic to date.<br /><br />Some have expressed the usual concerns about a slight muddiness in the sound EMI has given him here, although I suspect that has more to do with the acoustics inherent in the construction of the Philharmonie hall itself and the difficulty engineers have in capturing the clarity of a live performance; certainly any deficiency is not serious enough to detract from the pleasure I derive from listening to this thrilling performance.<br /><br />Rattle has in the past appeared to lack a convincing overview and defaulted into a certain fussy delicacy in his interpretation of composers like Brahms, Strauss and Bruckner who respond to the big bow-wow treatment. No such problem here; he maintains the kind of sumptuousness of sound for which Karajan made the BPO (in)famous whilst ensuring that he eschews the \\"soupiness\\" which could afflict recordings from the Karajan era.<br /><br />There is a massive solidity and a rich sonority about the playing here. I heard one little blip in the horns at 2:41 into the first movement but otherwise the orchestra's virtuosity throughout is breath-taking. I was also concerned that Rattle would be too clinical when I heard him first scud rather too blithely over the descending string figure five minutes in to which Giulini applies a little rubato and makes so poignant but my list of nit-picking was never extended beyond that point as I became utterly absorbed by Rattle's glorious commitment: the climax to this opening movement is both grand and urgent, showcasing the BPO in full flight.<br /><br />The Scherzo is, in my experience, pretty difficult to foul up even under a merely moderately gifted conductor and orchestra so here it goes just as it should; the lift and precision of the pizzicato passages are a joy.<br /><br />In the Adagio, Rattle is up against stiff competition from the likes of Giulini in his mesmerising accounts with both the VPO and in Stuttgart but he has the measure of the movement, providing us with stunning vistas as the D major trumpet theme ascends to the summit, aureate glow in the strings for the Dresden Amen and a crushing dissonant climax.<br /><br />Of course, for many the main interest here will be the stamp of legitimacy this recording, and the performances from which it was derived, confer upon the latest and last version of the Samale-Phillips-Cohrs-Mazzuca completion of the fourth movement. There have of course been several recordings of this but none this recent asserting that this is the \\"Conclusive Revised Edition\\". The most apt comparison to be made is with the superb Naxos recording by Johannes Wildner with the New Philharmonic Orchestra of Westphalia but that was made in 1998 and used the 1996 revision, in which you may hear the inclusion of a passage now deleted. Before the Berlin concerts, Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs explained that he and his collaborators agreed to remove sixteen bars containing a pianissimo and a crescendo in the interests of not interrupting the momentum from the beginning of the chorale recapitulation up to the end of the coda. This is a change I regret as I find the original idea very effective; otherwise the textures and colours of these final thoughts could hardly sound more convincingly Brucknerian. While I find the Carragan ending used by Gerd Schaller in his excellent set of three symphonies from the Ebrach Festival on the Profil label to be highly entertaining, I suspect that we are hearing from Rattle the closest we shall ever get to Bruckner's own thoughts. Rattle welds the three disparate themes drawn from motivic elements from the preceding movements into a cohesive and captivatingwhole. He emphasises the violence of the jagged first theme before transmuting it into a Dead March, then the horns embrace the grand, broad Wagnerian melody over pulsating strings - magical.whole.

B007FH9GT2|4.0|It is a murder mystery film, however it is also about the two main characters and their interactions and working together to solve a murder, or series of murders. I do not want to give anything away as the story and how it unfolds is what makes the movie run so well. Clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, the US version is quite long. However it is a movie which you rather it not end due to the entertaining characters and the intense visual situations which you wish to look away from, but you can't.My opinion Its the best one of the lot.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I love this book...from the very beginning to the very end it is interesting, descriptive, articulate and so easy to slip into the life of Ana and Christian - it's a total escape every time you open it, from the vast differences in the lifestyle of the practical and down to earth Ana to the extravagent and eccentric Christian and the discovery of his sad past and the sexual exploits - I loved every word - and it commands that you follow on to book 2 and book 3 which I have done.  I love the series, well worth the read!

0062197258|1.0|I am disturbed when I dislike a book. I always begin them with the highest of hopes for literary greatness or, at the very least, a guilty pleasure of escape. The book switches back and forth between 2003/2004 and 2007/2008, an extremely distracting juggling act every two-four pages that did not work for me. While I was interested in the main character's OCD, even that got old pretty quickly and I lost interest in her struggle. The book would have benefited from some prudent editing and a cohesive story line. The creep factor held up, but would have been much more powerful if told in a linear, suspense-building fashion. The character's motives for allowing a man to abuse her were not clear. Didn't she see the warning signs? I just didn't buy it.

B000002O51|3.0|I wore out 8-tracks on both BOSTON and DON'T LOOK BACK.  Bought and traded off both titles on Lp, then changed my mind and picked up the 2-fer CD versions.  Both BOSTON and DON'T LOOK BACK are part of the soundtrack of my teens, and occasionally I revisit lying in bed at home with the lights off, intently listening to the albums on my Radio Shack bulky headphones and hearing the \\"whirrrr\\" background sound in the quiet passages while the 8-track spun through the program.  2nd-hand cars were '70s Detroit boats with 350-block V-8s, Women's liberation held out that girls were easy, the Pill said it louder, and Nixon was finally gone from the White House, no more draft.<br /><br />THIRD STAGE came too late; it was pre-Reagan.

1610454812|3.0|Michael gives the audio a staunch, gruff narration, sounding like the stereotypical armed forces voice. Slow to medium pace, and slightly monotone, Michael speaks with an organic, smooth flow. Overall, the narration is a good attempt, but unimpressive. The quality of the narration, and work behind this book, is much deserved and appreciated, but this work only scores three stars on the scale. This book, while scoring three stars as well, is better as a print message, not meant for audio retelling.<br /><br />Read the complete review, and FTC disclosures, at scriptedgenius(dot)com.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  I was initially drawn to it because it is about a girl who begins dating a fighter.  I am married to one, so I figured I would identify with her to a degree.  And in the beginning, I did for a while.  Then it all got weird.  Really weird.<br /><br />It's a good book if you look at it from a very \\"It's just a book, period\\" point of view.  I wouldn't recommend this for teenage readers as it obviously isn't an ideal representation of how ANY relationship should go.  It's possessive, passionate, frustrating, angry, lustful, and at some points loving.<br /><br />I feel like it gives fighters a bad name in some cases.  Sure, you can have any guy go off the deep end and become super possessive and violent.  I also feel like once Abby's background is delved into, the book becomes almost fantastical.  It's no longer just fiction, it's a straight fantasy book.  Which again, like I said, if you look at it from that point of view, it's a decent book.<br /><br />Abby's background is just unbelievable to me, which was a little upsetting.  I think things could have been slightly changed to make her more believable while not compromising the integrity of the writing.<br /><br />Unfortunately if I continue anymore, I know I'll give away most of the plot and probably the ending as well.  In summation, if you can look at it as say \\"fantastical fiction\\", it's a great book.

Kids learns how the moon forms in its stages and how it doesn't appear every night. It even gets kids to think and imagine how the moon would look like in their hands. Some will disagree about the book and it's point, but \\"Papa, Please Get The Moon for Me\\" is still an entertaining read all in all, and one perfect bedtime book for kids.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best trilogy I have read in a long time.  I 'm not really into erotica but the storyline behind it sweeps you up.  Fifty shades gives you a clear picture of what unconditional love truly is.  We should all be so lucky to have this kind of whirlwind affair.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|There are no words....<br /><br />But here are a few I hope to never see again:<br /><br />Blush<br />Flush<br />Crap<br />Freaking<br />Hot<br />Jeez<br />Laters (I kid you not)<br />Baby<br /><br />I also hope to avoid books with this amount of italics and  ...  in the future.<br /><br />There are spoilers in here, but I don't give a crap.<br /><br />Rand McNally would have a coronary. This woman slept through Washington state, if she's ever been there at all.<br /><br />That this was a Twilight fanfic doesn't come as a shock. One-dimensional characters with no depth. Christian Grey is mildly<br />interesting until he falls flat in the second half. First half he's a hard ass, second half he's a pushover. Ana is a Puritanical simpleton with two facial expressions, a blush and an eye roll. Oh! She bites her lip a lot too (which he gets mad at her for, because he wants to do it himself. Every time she does it). So that makes three. None of the other characters are memorable enough to mention.<br /><br />I forced myself to finish because I'll be damned if I put down a $10 book without finishing it. Toward the last 25% or so, all I did was skim the dialogue and still gleaned enough information to know that things ended exactly the way I figured they would. Which is to say just like any other good-girl-falls-for-screwed-up-dude story ends. Predictably. He tells her repeatedly that he's bad for her. He won't let her touch him at all, tells her he was introduced to his lifestyle by a much older married woman when he was only 15, and fails to see the wrong in what she did to him. He stalks her, tracks her cell phone, shows up unannounced while she's visiting her mother in Georgia. He tells her he wants to hurt her. He spanks her. As \\"punishment\\" for rolling her eyes. He beats her fun parts with a riding crop. He flogs her (no kidding). She asks for him to show her how bad it can get, and then goes mental because it HURTS. SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!<br /><br />She sticks around right up to the last ten pages because she's somehow in love. In luuuuurrrrrvvvv.<br /><br />I'll stick to run-of-the-mill romances from now on. They're hotter,and I give a crap about the characters when its all said and done.<br /><br />Just to cover my opinionated tush, I know there are people who enjoy a Dominant/Submissive lifestyle, and that's cool. I am not being judgmental about the way others live their lives. That being said, what is described in this book doesn't seem to me to be any more than base sadism and abuse. If I'm wrong, I apologize as I have no understanding of this lifestyle whatsoever.
0345803507|5.0|*Sigh...as with all things, some stories must come to an end. Without giving anything away, I found that Book 3 brought the storyline to a good place. I probably liked Books 1 and 2 better as the repetitiveness became a little tiresome in Book 3. But having said that, I was still completely hooked and couldn't put this book down. And as per my previous reviews on this trilogy, and after a second read, yep...I'm still having an affair with Christian Grey: [...]    One of the most intriguing parts was at the end, where E L James shares a couple of chapters from Christian's perspective. For the Fifty Shades of Grey fan, I would love to read the trilogy all from his perspective (hint? hint?).    All in all, another very enjoyable escape. The fairy tale continues, filled with adventure and kinky, hot sex. Loved it.
B007C4E1R0|2.0|I loved the first two books in this series, but this one felt disjointed.

0345803485|5.0|I didn't want to like this series. I tried to avoid the hype, but succumbed once and downloaded the free preview on Amazon. I wasn't that impressed so left it alone...until there was a lot more hype. So I thought, what the heck...there must be something to this so I read the first book. Then I couldn't put it down and when I finished it, I immediately downloaded the second book, and soon after that the third. I completed the trilogy within one week.    Here is my first blog post on the trilogy: [...](NO SPOILERS). To take this to another crazy level, I just re-read the trilogy. Quite frankly, I'm having an affair with Christian Grey: [...]    Listen, this is not an award-winning piece of literature; I think people should critique it for what it is. It is a fun, kinky escape; a fairy tale with kinky sex; an easy read that is simply fun entertainment. Yes, the writing is a repetitive and the characters may come across as one-dimensional. But I still found it a very enjoyable read. Is it all about the sex? I'd say, yes. I found it very hot.    I have not read an erotic novel like this in a very long time. I'm not a Harlequin Romance fan, nor am I a Twilight fan (and quite frankly was a little disappointed when the connection was revealed). All in all, we often read books to escape our day-to-day, and I'd say that Fifty Shades of Grey fits the bill. I really enjoyed Books 1 and 2.

B004J4WKDI|5.0|Based on rave reviews of this book, I downloaded this to my iPad and took it on my beach trip a few months ago. It is filled with mystery and magical whimsy. It is a touching love story. It takes your imagination away to the magical place of the circus. I absolutely enjoyed it, and remembered I couldn't put it down. Maybe confusing for some who have a hard time letting their imagination go.<br /><br />A great debut by the author.
B0050IY61G|2.0|This book is a good resources for graduate students or other professionals, but not really written for the public. This book was written almost as if it were a textbook or proceedings from a psychology conference, but has been marketed to the general public.<br /><br />It is very dry and technical. The author is obviously a highly knowledgeable professional with an extensive understanding of the Syndrome. Unfortunately, he has no gifts or talents for storytelling or writing for a more general audience. It is not very enjoyable to read or engaging. It's a great book to read if you have trouble sleeping at night or if you are writing a paper for a class.<br /><br />So, unless you are a professional in a field in which you already have an understanding of Asperger's syndrome, this book would not be of practical use.<br /><br />For parents raising a kid who are not working on their Ph.D in cognitive science, then I would recommend The OASIS Guide to Asperger Syndrome. The OASIS has a lot of information backed by current research, but is very practical. This book, on the other hand, was obviously written for parents and teachers in mind, and is highly engaging, entertaining, and accessible.<br /><br />If you are on a limited budget, I'd go with the OASIS guide.
0345803493|5.0|As per my review of the first book, I didn't want to like this trilogy...but I became completely hooked. I couldn't put this down especially after finishing Book 1.    Once again, the writing is repetitive and there is a lot of back-and-forth banter between Ana and Christian about the same topics. But there was also some unexpected adventure and still lots of fun, hot, kinky sex in between. And Christian's dark past continues to be revealed. This is not award-winning writing, but I still found this to be a very enjoyable escape...and I am still having an affair with Christian Grey [..]    If you loved Book 1, this is a must-read.
B000I5XOW8|5.0|After seeing the film in its original format (theater), later on VHS, I had to have it in Blu-ray format, even at a much reduced price. It's still one riveting film since its release years ago with two great actors, Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones (best supporting actor oscar winner).  The story holds your attention from the first scene to the last with great acting, and filmed-on-site moving action scenes.  The train wreck is terrific in its originality and close-ups.  This film is a classic and a must-have for anyone's video home library of great movies.

B007MAETA8|5.0|Had a look at the other reviews & just had to put my version across, yes it is different to the last CD which was different to the one before & so on.  It depends on what you want, I really like this CD, the playing is a lot more subtle, the guy has enormous talent, I really like the way his voice is right at the front.  Even if it sounds stripped down it isn't, you can cover a great deal with loud guitars & production, here there isn't any where to go, that takes talent, you can hear the guy, really hear where he is coming from. I'm just sold on the voice
1451683405|3.0|To \\"out\\" my bias:  I am a strong opponent of the idea of free will.  Sam Harris' book reads like the sort of meditation on free will one might offer at a happy hour on a college campus:  Engaging, thoughtful, not particularly earth-shattering.  If you're well-read on the topic and looking for something to push your thinking further, this is probably not the source.  If you're looking for a casual (but intelligent) rendezvous with a skeptic, this would be a good place to go.  Certainly a good read for newcomers to the topic -- as an educator, I'm thinking about introducing it as a text in my freshman year seminar.
B007G5H2HQ|4.0|This was a good family night movie. Had some laughs for the grownups much like the Shrek's but more importantly kept the interest of the little guys. I was a little skeptical about the spinoff character (puss) not being able to support a movie on his own. I was pleasantly surprised.

B007SGM084|3.0|I decided to go ahead and purchase this book because I had heard so many great things about it and figured I could loan it out to friends once I had finished. That way others wouldn't be out $30 when they wanted to read it too. Little did I know that this book is NOT loanable. So, I wasted $30 to read a book I could have downloaded elsewhere and transferred to my kindle, and now my friends have to borrow my actual kindle if they want to read it!
1439156816|4.0|Are you a writer? I was once. Gave it up for almost 12 years. When I finally searched for help deciding if I had made a mistake - given up on my talents too easily, misunderstood the industry and the path of a successful writer maybe - Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\" turned out to be just what my neglected little writer's heart needed to hear.<br /><br />Wish I'd read the darn thing when I bought it 10 years ago.<br /><br />This innocent-looking volume is part autobiography, part fiction writing how-to (and how-not-to) and all of it eerily absorbing. Like me, you will probably read this all in a day and find yourself laughing through tears as King explains how to (among other things):<br /><br />1. Accept rejection - and look forward to the gifts hidden in some of those form rejection letters<br /><br />2. Avoid passive voice and make adverbs your enemy<br /><br />3. Get an agent and why you need one (hint: this will only be useful for those seeking publication)<br /><br />4. Write great query letters<br /><br />5. Edit your manuscript and sift through early feedback<br /><br />6. Set up an effective writer's workspace<br /><br />7. Grow your skills as a writer<br /><br />8. Write about work and how it hooks readers (strangely)<br /><br />Still, the biggest nuggets of stand-out, original writing advice King shares are his theories on ideas like:<br /><br />1. Writing a story being likened to digging up fossils (the story already exists, you just have to learn how to tap in and uncover it)<br /><br />2. Writing with the door closed (first draft), and with the door open (finally letting others get a chance to read and say something about your novel) and why this method is so important<br /><br />3. Liberating your writing by throwing pre-planned plot and notebooking away (but he mentions how his method may not work for everyone but explains what he thinks this adds to the quality of his work and his enjoyment of the process)<br /><br />4. Why reading the sludge of poopy writers can help you be a better writer yourself<br /><br />5. Why you should never write a thing for money<br /><br />6. What a writer's two most important tasks are - WRITING & READING. How much time you should spend every day on these two tasks if you want to be a good writer - 4 to 6 hours. And that you need to give yourself permission to read, read, read - but King grants you his permission, just in case you're still too terrified to think of indulging yourself for 4-6 hours in something you love to do and getting away with calling it \\"work\\".<br /><br />And if these ideas don't move you, there's King's personal stories of his childhood, his early writing life and the road to his first publication, and finally his memories of being run over by a van driven by one of his own characters.<br /><br />While some may complain that much of King's biography is irrelevant - because it is unrelated to his writing life - or only there to shine some light on his loved ones, I disagree.<br /><br />The stories of his life - his childhood, brother, mother, school days, meeting his wife, struggles with alcoholism and drug addiction - like any of our own, are the things that shaped who he is as a man - his character and perspective - not just his writing and his life as a writer. And since all good writers put themselves into their work, by sharing with us even the \\"irrelevant\\" memories ( but the ones indelibly planted in his soul), King is telling us all about the man we get a glimpse of in every story he writes.<br /><br />Besides, it is good for those who may be discouraged to see just how much a writer as successful as King had to struggle - to live, to work, to finish school, to save his marriage. He did not come from money. He did not get \\"discovered\\" after writing his first story and go on to fame and fortune. He did not quit his day job (not for a while, anyway). He did not have connections. He experienced some tough breaks, but he never let the bitterness of life take away his joy for writing (or for life).<br /><br />My favorite part of the whole thing is the story about his brother Dave's Super Dooper Magnet. I was howling and crying, couldn't breath from laughing so hard. That one \\"irrelevant\\" story makes your reading this worthwhile - but I assure you there are many such moments in King's \\"On Writing.\\" So pick it up. Let it set you free to write, and show you how it's done.ay his joy for writing (or for life).<br /><br />My favorite part of the whole thing is the story about his brother Dave's Super Dooper Magnet.

0439023513|5.0|I just finished the last book of this trilogy. I am so glad I took the advice of a friend to read it before I saw the movie. It took me a little more than a week to read all three.<br /><br />The action starts quickly in all three books, and the pace is maintained throughout. Very easy reading but still entertaining.

0439023521|5.0|This series is very easy to read and I really enjoyed all three books. I ordered all three at the same time, and I'm glad I did. I was able to finish the series in a little more than a week and it would have made me crazy to wait.<br /><br />If you are used to multiple plot lines or heavier reading, you will tear through this book in a weekend.

0439023491|5.0|I could not put this book down! I am so glad I ordered all three at the same time, because once I started reading, I did not want to be interrupted. I finished the trilogy in a little over a week.<br /><br />This is very easy reading, so you can pick it up and put it down whenever you need to. I usually read heavier books with multiple plot lines, but I really enjoyed all three of these books.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This will contain a few very minor spoilers but I doubt it would ruin anything if you have not read this book yet.<br />The first half of the book really had my attention and I wanted to see what was going to happen, however after the time travel part it lost me a little bit. I felt like some things could have been explained better in the book for instance when Jacob first went through to the other side it was confusing about where he ended up at. There was some over explained parts of the book and some very under explained parts for me. Not to say I didn't enjoy the second half of the book because I really did just felt like it could have been done a little better.<br />The story line and the pictures were a great idea, and for me at least a very original idea. I loved the old time pictures in the book and I loved the children but it would have been great if there backgrounds would have been explained a little more.<br />I will more then likely pick up the second book in the series because the ending is a cliff hanger.<br />Overall I would recommend this book but probably more to teens who the book is geared towards anyway. ;) Adults like me can enjoy it to tho.
0316098329|5.0|I listened to this as an audio book so my experience may be different than those who read the physical book.<br /><br />The cast who read this book (I think there were 4) were phenomenal. I listen to a lot of audio books and all of these people did a wonderful job with different character voices and keeping the book moving and engaging. I always knew who was who and followed along nicely. 5/5 stars!<br /><br />This book was incredible. It's not happy or uplifting by any means...not even really at the end. However, it's very interesting. As a speech-language pathologist who primarily works with infants-preschoolers, I really enjoyed hearing the voice of Jack as the narrator. Donoghue did a wonderful job getting inside the mind of a 5-year-old; and not just any 5-year-old, but one who has lived in a single room his entire life.<br /><br />Jack loves Room. He was born here (knows the story even), has never left Room, and everything he could ever want/need is in Room! He and Ma have Bed, Toilet, Rocker, Tub, Fridge, Stove, TV, Skylight, Rug, and Wardrobe; what else could they need?!? They have a pretty steady daily routine of meals within a certain hour, bathing, PE time, and only about 30-60 mins of TV per day. They also have weekly routines of cleaning Room and other things. Oh, and Ma and Jack are being held captive and Jack has to stay/sleep in Wardrobe on nights the captor \\"visits\\" Ma. But those last things don't really bother Jack because that's all he's ever known.<br /><br />However, Jack just turned 5! He's older now, more mature (very verbal with a great vocabulary) and is beginning to ask more questions about Outside.<br /><br />As someone who works with preschoolers a lot, I love Jack's voice in this story. He has a very mature vocabulary for his age, but Donoghue uses it well. Jack uses big words, but still has a lot of grammatical mistakes common (and cute) for his age. He also has a wonderful inner monologue as well as outward communication with Ma. It is interesting to see inside someone's interpretation of an unusual 5-year-old mind.<br /><br />I do not want to give anything away about what happens, however, just know that their situation does change and the book is just as much about that shift as it is about the aftermath. As long as their initial situation does not upset you too much and you can get through it, you will be fine reading this book (I have a friend who read one chapter and quit). I think it's very well written, interesting, engaging and fascinating.interesting to see inside someone's interpretation of an unusual 5-year-old mind.<br /><br />I do not want to give anything away about what happens, however, just know that their situation does change and the book is just as much about that shift as it is about the aftermath.

I have followed and fell in love with her and her perfomance in this and her other films. I love her in this move and would love to meet her some day in real life and thank her for giving such a great performace for her fan base. India is a great upcoming actress as well dont miss her in this film I cant say enough about her but GO GIRL make history.I hope these two stay togather and come out with something even better soon. Underworld meets Stan Lee. oh man anyone not giving this 5 stars is insane... Must watch.... Don't talk your way out of this one. Most people are not into Vampire and Warewolf movies But please open your mind up and watch this. Not a Horor slasher film by all means and you may come out with a hole new opinion and my end up buying the complete DVD set if your not careful.<br />ThAnKs KaTe
B00009V7RF|4.0|This is truly a diverse CD.  The songs vary with their beat and their message. Yes, they do have a message here. They are upbeat and fun. The songs are not just \\"talking just to be talking.\\" The songs range from a player getting busted to dancing to proud heritage to political awareness.  There is definitely depth to this CD.  It is by far their best CD. There is not the commercialization that you hear in the CDs that followed this one. The composition of the music shows talent and skill, not just someone spinning a record in the background. The harmonizing is smooth and appropriate.  This is a \\"straight no chaser\\" Cd so, if cursing or the word retarded is offensive to you, you may want to pass.  This is the CD in its original form before they decided to get \\"politically correct\\" and change Let's get Retarded to Let's get it started along with some of other words in the song.  The song is not meant to offend, but speaks of the old days when people went to the club to have \\"crazy\\" fun and dance the night away.  There is no thought to how you are dancing, just that you are moving your body.<br />This is definitely a must have CD.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|How steamy!  The first book was a real page turner.  I couldn't put it down.  The second book was pretty good, but was much slower.  And the third book seemed to drag by.

0345803485|1.0|I don't typically write negative reviews, as what may not be my cup of tea may be perfectly suited to someone else, but in this case I felt compelled to make an exception.<br /><br />I wish there was an option for 0 stars. These books are mind-numbingly awful.<br /><br />The characters and \\"story\\" leave much to be desired, but what disturbs me the most is the horrific writing. It makes Twilight look like Shakespeare.<br /><br />I couldn't read the whole book. I borrowed a copy to see what the hype was about and tried to read it, but it was so terrible I just skimmed the rest to see if at any point during the story the author learns how to write properly. She doesn't.<br /><br />I understand the desire for a light, guilty-pleasure story, but plenty of those have been written by real writers - you know, people who've studied the craft, worked at it, and taken the time to create something worthy of a reader's time and attention.<br /><br />This book reads like some woman randomly decided to take up writing as a hobby one day, banged out some random scenarios, and just hit \\"publish\\". It's worse than most of the stuff you read in beginners writing classes.<br /><br />I enjoy singing, but as I'm a terrible singer, I do it by myself in the shower. I don't sell recordings of my off-key songs to people and start calling myself a singer.<br /><br />This woman is either without any talent, or too lazy to develop whatever writing skills she may have.<br /><br />Bottom line is: books are meant to be written by people who can write.

0345803485|5.0|I LOVED this book - the entire series actually.  I devoured them and cannot stop thinking about them.  That said, there are flaws.  The author does reuse a lot of words - \\"Crap, Holy Crap, Double Crap...\\" but it's funny in context for the most part.  She also reuses her descriptions a lot \\"hooded eyes, darkening eyes, etc.\\" but I still found the story to be really well developed and laid out and the graphic parts were hot!  If you want a literary giant, move on - if you want something to make you \\"squirm\\" (as Ana so often does) then get these books.  Don't waste your time buying 1 - get all 3 or you will not understand the story at all!
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer's music is no Otis Redding or Radiohead. For the casual walk-in-the-park, secondhand-smoke listeners, it's still good accessible music. The real charm however lies in multiple listens, the layers that you peel away.<br /><br />It's funny how I remember every phase of my last five years of existence through a John Mayer album. They're like bookmarks, neatly dividing the book into shades of white and grey. It all might sound a little too juvenile but it is what it is. Those albums remind me of a time smothered with so much innocence, it's unimaginable for me to shrug the feeling off. I find myself in a completely different position from how it was back then as I write about Mayer today. It's 2012 and I'm two albums away from the album that redefined how I interpreted music - Continuum. The parallel running similarities creep me out at times, but I've learned to live with it.<br /><br />For the sake of this review, I realize that I must do one essential thing.<br /><br />Fan boy mode : OFF<br /><br />Finally, and gosh have we waited for 6 years, Born And Raised is everything Continuumwas and so much more.<br /><br />After the success of Continuum, John wanted to shred the sumptuous bluesy pop ambience and write a country record. The plans had to take the back burner for a while as John decided to write something else instead for his next studio release. 2009s Battle Studies was a decent effort but for all it's worth, it was John Mayer lite - Fleetwood Mac-esque, low-key, striped-down melodies, super-polished mainstream pop record about heartbreak. A good album as a whole but it suffered from low listenability; faded away with time and got skipped almost every time his discography was revisited by the fans. It was mildly annoying since it just seemed like a lazy step back instead of a step forward, something that just doesn't look good on what John has fostered in his twelve years of music career.<br /><br />Right from the beginning of Born And Raised, it becomes evident that he feels at home this time around. Everything is so much more organic and heartfelt, it's overwhelming. The opener is that one good country song that Keith Urban or Tim McGraw wished they had written. A playful chorus with the glorious lead solo, Queen Of California is the soundtrack of every droptop Mercedes cruising away from a city skyline.<br /><br />Musically, the minimalistic low-key approach complements everything perfectly, giving Mayer enough room to play around with his new-found calm and repose. The reason why this is the coming of age of John Mayer is sprinkled all over the album. Life events are now less calamitous and more of an experience. He's done with low-handed mud slinging, holding on to something that doesn't exist and everything callow and innocent. \\"It's just a phase, it's not forever and I still might have a ways to go.\\" - he croons in Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey.<br /><br />If Heavier Things was a lyric-lover's paradise, John is on another echelon this time around. Each song is a tad more personal than its predecessors, making Born And Raisedthe most intimate record John has written yet. The title song, for that instance, is the warmth of acceptance of how/why things are the way they are. \\"Still have dreams, they're not the same. They don't fly as high as they used to.\\" - Born And Raised is bold and mature, unlike the helplessness and yearning of Speak For Me. The feel is chiefly folkish and acoustic, but not in a way that would render the songs colorless. There's just enough soul in songs like Something Like Olivia to make you tap your feet, sing along as well as be moved and provoked by the simplicity.<br /><br />What makes Born And Raised perfect is how it's a stark contrast to what Continuumwas. Instead of being an album which is versatile, multi-faceted and full of worthy singles, this is much more cohesive and humanlike. Whiskey, Whiskey, Whiskey is followed by what might possibly be a career highlight. Just by the name, one can tell how ambitiousWalt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967 is. It's an emotionally-fueled story about a man who thought against the grain and went against the odds. The song begins with a simple dobro picking and trumpet and breaks into something so beautiful, you shouldn't be surprised if you find a little something in your eye by the end of the song. In fact, Walt Grace's Submarine Test, January 1967 could have an album of its own.<br /><br />This is it. As the credits roll along with the reprise version of the title song and the rightful closer, a feeling of completeness takes over. Like Continuum was a boy's living soul,Born And Raised is a grown man's narrative. There's no more questioning, no more dissatisfaction... instead, John comes around and accepts the beauty of it. One of the slightest hints of love is seen in A Face To Call Home, but it's unlike anything John has written before. It swells into a massive chorus towards the end, but the boyish charm makes way for the maturity of a bruised heart. There's a restrain which makes it all the more appealing. Clearly, he has embraced everything he used to fight before and the outcome is evident in Born And Raised. For the last few lines of this review, this happens - Fanboy Mode ON. This is everything that you look for in music. You want to feel something. That's what we all are looking for, isn't it? While we find solace in Born And Raised, Mayer continues to be the living proof that there's a hidden genius in the quiet and contemplative.

B00723NWJE|5.0|I have been an on-and-off again Nora Jones fan. Wasn't too much into the last two albums, but this new one took me by surprise. I'd say almost every song on it is good just like on \\"Feels like Home.\\" I liked it enough to buy the vinyl of it, too. Norah is up there in the best sellers right now with Adelle and others who have two or three good songs, and the rest is filler. Norah, on this one, actually put a lot of heart into it. The songs have a lot of depth and atmosphere. I'll keep this one for a while.

B00004SVIK|5.0|I \\"stumbled\\" upon this on \\"YouTube\\".<br /><br />Then I found out that the song list is not consistent between albums.<br /><br />I also found out the members had vastly different artistic direction, so some versions are absolutely atrocious.<br /><br />This album is the only one you need.<br /><br />\\"Mother\\" is almost eight minutes long and is a glorious version.  Same with \\"Nobody Home\\".  All the songs are the best version I have heard, but you will only get these versions of \\"Mother\\" and \\"Nobody Home\\" on this concert rendition.<br /><br />The song list is about as thorough as you are going to find--though it does not contain every piece from the movie.  Check the song-list carefully for what you want to hear.<br /><br />If you do some more research, I am convinced you will agree that if you get one \\"Wall\\" CD, this would be it.<br /><br />One of the best concert performances ever.

Unlike a lot of the search games out there that are either too easy or are so hard they give you a heache, this game is challenging,  yet not frustrating to figure out. The game.has clues that help you,  but there are a few challenges that they leave you to figure out on your own.  However if you use your brain,  and powers of deduction,  you will figure out the clues.<br />In Short : Challenging.,  but not frustrating,  Fun,  will. keep you interested. Plus cool ending....

B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|worst movie of the DECADE. Its so boring. I actually thought this was going to be a comedy like scary movie. Sara and Pat actually did a good job, there are lots of funny moments. But scary moments just one. Thats it. There is even one scene with a ghost in a sheet.. yeah thats right, inside a bed sheet, its really that pathetic. Even the grudge is a LOT more scarier than this. Plain awful, 90 minutes for just one scary scene! By the way story sucks. Sara and Pat are the only staff members at the soon to be closer Inn. Neither one of them has even encountered a ghost before so they are eager to search this haunted hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. After Sara has a fright moment with a ghost inside bed-sheets, she continues to \\"work\\" in the hotel. Even though she knows the hotel will closing its doors, beats me why someone would stay in a hanted place. Boring, no chills, no scary moments, no frightning moments, nothing!
B00000FC5H|5.0|This is the one to get if you're not going through with the long haul on EWF (but it's worth it if you do!).<br /><br />The remasters are crisp and clear, although to be truthful, EWF were so well-produced at the time that their work has never been available in a lacking way.<br /><br />If you're new to this band, find out why EWF were Michael Jackson's favourite act (for a while).
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|*I've loved Shinedown since I became acquainted with their sophomore album Us and Them several years ago. Brent's voice is one of the best and most distinguishable in the industry today, and this band continues to create a legacy with this album.<br />I never thought they would top Us and Them, with its unique originality. BUT I TRULY BELIEVE THEY TOPPED THAT ALBUM AND THEN MORE. I must recommend Amaryllis to anyone enjoying rock n' roll--from light to modern to heavy. This album equates to pure gold.
B0078JPCJK|5.0|I can't remember ever being this enamored by a television series.  The characters and storylines strikes my heart with joy, sadness and everything in between.  I hope this series lasts for years to come.
B001BR7CZW|4.0|Great Movie that is very good. Everyone should see it. Both of the actors are very good and do an excelent job.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|My daughters and I have read all three of this series and this last book is the most disappointing. We loved the first two but this last book was very different from the first two. One of my daughters had to take a break from reading it because it was so slow moving and I agree with her. Katniss changed so much from the first book, even the second book. I really thought she would be a heroine but the last book does her such an injustice. The end was just too tidy and felt like Ms. Collins just wanted to finish it up.<br /><br />On the positive the emotions and descriptions were beautiful and really took the reader into the book. It was during the slow moving sections that I wished Ms. Collins would have included more emotions. I will not let this last book spoil our liking of the writing style and my daughters and I will continue to read more of Collins' work.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Already started reading the next book in the trilogy on my Kindle...such an engaging storyline revealing the outcome of all that is wrong for the human spirit.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Everyone can afford this one.  .99 cents is well worth it.  You really can't afford to not buy it.  Other calculators aren't always user friendly but this one is.
0307730697|5.0|Captivating and honest, reading Fearless is truly an emotional experience.  Combat lit is not generally my genre- but this portrait of Adam Brown is so much more than a soldier's story - it's a book about family and passion for life- I couldn't recommend this more.
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This was an exceptional album well worth the buy. while I didn't like every song the ones that I did like were worth it. Good to listen at any time, especially during workouts.
B0028IDXDS|1.0|We thought this paci would stay in better because the stuffed animal would lay next to baby in the crib and sort of hold it in place. Thats what we concluded after reading the back story of the wubbanub. It would work if it was big enough, but its not. Very light weight and wont reach the crib bed when baby is on his back. Just kinda hangs there a bit til it falls out. Also has that made in china/ carnival prize type of quality feel to it. We found that the standard paci works better because with the wubbanub baby actually catches the stuffed animal with his arms when he flails them and it rips the paci out of his mouth. Definitely NOT worth the $13 they are asking for these things, even if you get free super saver shipping.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, you won't regret buying it. Just be sure you read \\"The Hunger Games\\" first though.<br /><br />LONG LIVE PEETA!!
B004S5C8WG|5.0|I found  A Prisoner of Birth a real page tuner.  If you Like Jeffrey Archer you won't be disappointed.  I highly recommend this book.
0307730697|5.0|Received an early copy of \\"Fearless\\" by Eric Blehm, and couldn't put it down.  This is an amazing story, about an a man who overcame the impossible to be an elite member of SEAL Team VI.  I am an avid reader, Clancy, Robinson, Flynn, etc, but Eric has done an incredible job, of showing the love, forgiveness, and devotion of the Brown family, that allowed Adam to become the man he was.  I knew Adam as a kid, and later as a man, as well as his family, and if you read one book, besides the Bible all year, THIS IS THE ONE!  It is an unvarnished, no holds barred account what it takes, and what one man overcame, to be an example for us all.  My hats is off to Eric Blehm, and the Brown family- this book has changed my life, and I am a much better man for having read it.  Eric, Kelley, Janice, Larry, Mandy, Shawn, and Nathan and Savannah, along with the lost members of Team VI, we salute you for an incredible story.  Read this, read it again, get your kids, grandkids, friends, strangers even to follow suit.  This is why this country is GREAT!  Magnficent read.
B000083E79|5.0|For most fans, this CD contains all of the \\"must have\\" songs from Cher's decades of music.  From the early Sonny and Cher hits to her newer stuff, this CD has them all.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love playing this game, but has some bug problems.  You have to reload if you want to visit other areas and most of the time which is 9.9 times you can't access them at all.  It makes the game boring and I want to not play if I can't advance in the game by visiting other players.
0345803485|3.0|Ok, so I thought this was going to be like a crime drama, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo kind of thing, I guess I didn't read any reviews before I picked it up. Its more like a Twilight with a lot of sex. The characters are unrealistic, and so is the sex, frankly. I mean, for a 21 year old woman who has never even touched herself she is absurdly orgasmic. Her first orgasm came from him fondling her breasts, and her second orgasm moments later. Really? One would think since it only takes a breeze to make her orgasm, she would have encountered a breeze before this. Especially since she is so clearly attractive, especially considering all the men who want her. Someone might have kissed her before her 21st birthday- like the photographer who is in love with her, or the the guy from Princeton that always asks her out.<br /><br />Her lover is equally unlikely. He's a 26 year old billionaire, not a mediocre millionaire, but a billionaire. I mean we've all heard of MZ, so sure, its possible. What does he do exactly? Well, he is very intuitive(?) he also likes to feed people. Sheesh, I've been a intuitive person who feeds people since I was like 19. I clearly could have made more shrewd choices with my career. Oh and for someone who doesn't sleep with people (like with his eyes closed in a dream state) or date, or have girlfriends, he sure does a lot of sleeping with her and dating and treats her like a girlfriend, with whom he is completely obsessed. Where is the paparazzi, btw? I mean the dude is a \\"freaking hot\\" (her words, not mine) billionaire, you'd think someone would want to take his picture once in a while.<br /><br />So, I am still reading it. I thought it might give me a little insight into the culture of Sub-Dom that I've see so often referenced. However, I have a feeling the real world is a lot less of a cheesy love story with far fewer repetitive sex scenes. I have read about numerous lip biting (her own, harmlessly, mind you, but it drives him mad with desire),eye rolling (wouldn't you roll your eyes if your lover wanted to spank you?), foil ripping (the guy putting on a condom is a wise responsibly never omitted), multiple orgasmic sex scenes, and I'm barely half way through the book.<br /><br />Sex all the time is high on her list, in fact it happens like two days after they meet, but she does get annoyed when he buys her a car, and she refuses to let him buy her clothes (so far, but I bet she gives in soon). I think she even tries to treat for coffee. Clearly everyone needs to be aware that she's \\"not a ho\\". Good to know she has some boundaries.<br /><br />Its an easy read. Certainly not hard to follow, and I haven't read a book truly like it. I might even read all three since the elibrary has loaned them to me. Not a bad read before bed, just not a really good read either.
B0072IVGZG|4.0|Reaction upon first listening - the production is back to high quality, which is nice since the last album (Born Into This) was underproduced - or perhaps, just produced in a style not fitting of The Cult's music.  A lot of Cult fans thought that Beyond Good and Evil was overproduced, and I can see what they mean, though I love that CD.  The production here is probably closer to Sonic Temple than either Born or Beyond.  Nice balance between the instruments / vocals.  Ian sounds great and Billy's growling tone is back!<br /><br />The songs are really good.  Nice groove on \\"The Wolf.\\"  \\"Life > Death\\" is classic mellow Cult.  Some good rockers as well!  After listening a couple more times \\"Amnesia\\" and \\"A Pale Horse\\" are cool tunes and \\"Wilderness Now\\" is really growing on me.  I really think it must have been hard to pick a single for this album.  This is The Cult that I've been missing since Beyond Good and Evil.  In many ways, this might be The Cult some fans have been missing since much earlier in their career.<br /><br />While I would have loved a bit more ferocity, the album doesn't suffer for the lack there of.  I think they blend the history of their various sounds well here.  I hear traces of almost every album at various places in these songs, and while this one might not necessarily become anyones favorite Cult CD - there's something here for every Cult fan.  It encompasses the history of The Cult, but doesn't sound redundant - familiar, but fresh.  It's a very solid effort!<br /><br />One thing that might bother some of my fellow Billy Duffy followers is there aren't solos on every song, not that the album lacks his presence, his signature playing is all over these songs - more than Born Into This at any rate.  As a guitar player, I can say this doesn't detract from the songs themselves, but since Billy's one of my favorites - I would have loved for him rip it up a bit more.<br /><br />The capsule (bonus) songs, for anyone who hasn't heard them, are a niceaddition on the Deluxe Edition, so if you missed your chance to get them the first time you'll want the DE.  I really like \\"Siberia\\" and \\"Embers.\\"<br /><br />Get the 2-disc deluxe version now for only $9.99 here on Amazon, or at Best Buy!  It was pointed out to me that the single disc version comes out June 4.  You might as well get the 4 studio cuts from the \\"capsules\\" for free while you can.  Also, know that that there is no mention of the bonus disc or extra songs on the packaging.  Since I was unaware of the separate release dates for both versions at the time, I had to hold the case to the light and look down into the packaging to see that there were 2 discs included on either side of the booklet.  Just for kicks, the UPC for my deluxe edition is 711297494891.<br /><br />Fellow Amazonian Andrew S. Smith points out that iTunes has the album + bonus tracks for $7.99!  Thanks, Andrew!
0307730697|5.0|I was somewhat conflicted when I read the story of this hero.  Having read many of the books published about Navy SEALs, one thing stands out, they all have an extreme focus on the end goal and make choices that move them closer to that goal.  Adam Brown made some bad choices that had to be overcome.  While any journey to wear a SEAL Trident takes a monumental effort, Adams journey is even more incredible with all the stumbling blocks he encountered.<br /><br />Fearless is the obvious title for this book.  Adam Brown became fearless by his deep belief in God, his wife, his family, and his team.  You have to respect a person that would rather die than let down his team.  That dedication shows when on the road to Kandahar their Humvee hit another vehicle and flipped multiple times.  Adam severed the fingers of his right hand and they were hanging on with skin and tendons, but he completely disregarded that injury and went to work saving his teammate that had his leg crushed in the accident.  Only when the Corpsman had his friend stabilized did he allow someone to tend to his injuries.<br /><br />This book pays tribute to this hero.  The author spoke with his childhood friends and family and in the first 80 pages outlined the story of a fun-loving kid.  He was a kid who liked to push himself and loved dangerous feats, like jumping off of bridges into the river.  He excelled at everything he attempted, and was on the path to do anything he wanted, when he made some bad choices and started using drugs.  I have seen first-hand the damage that drugs like crack can do, so this story is even more amazing that he reached the top tier of the Navy SEALs while having to overcome the constant call of his crack addiction.  While I did not like the person he was during his dark time with drugs, I did find myself pulling for him to succeed.<br /><br />SEAL Team Six is the \\"best of the best\\" and a place where you have to be in the top 1% of a group that is already in the top 1% of the planet.  You have to perform at incredibly high levels that most people, with fully functioning bodies and minds cannot achieve.  Adam severed the fingers of his right hand, his shooting hand.  He was injured in a training accident and lost sight in his right eye, his dominant shooting eye.  He caved in his shinbone, had back problems, arthritis, walked around in constant pain all while fighting the urge to smoke crack, yet he still managed to overcome these issues, any one of which would disqualify a normal man, yet he still forged on.<br /><br />Adam went to Sniper school, a school with a very high attrition rate, because only the best graduate from this incredibly tough school.  Now many SEALs complete Sniper school, but Adam had to relearn how to shoot using his left hand and his left eye.  That is unheard of.<br /><br />All throughout this book you will be touched by Adam's generosity and his constant devotion to others.  In Afghanistan he would never leave any checkpoint or observation post without helping fill sandbags or in some way fortifying the outpost.  He would regularly give away his MREs to the local children and even organized his church to send kids sneakers when he realized that the local Afghan children had to wear open sandals during the harsh mountain winters.  He was a man that always made the world a better place for others.<br /><br />By the time I was halfway through this book I was increasingly saddened because I felt it unfair that a hero like Adam was going to die.  But true to his character his life ended in a detailed battle where he never once stopped to think about himself, he just remained fearless while trying to protect and defend others.<br /><br />His loyalty to his team was shown in their loyalty to him.  When he was shot multiple times and badly wounded his teammates made heroic efforts to save him and get him to a hospital.  Sadly, as we all know, he did not make it.<br /><br />Adam touched a lot of people during his short life.  He made a difference to many people.  If a man is judged by the positive difference he makes in the lives of others, then Adam Brown truly is a hero.ife.  He made a difference to many people.  If a man is judged by the positive difference he makes in the lives of others, then Adam Brown truly is a hero.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cannot believe this is best seller. Some one told me it is just a fun, guilty read if you can get past, the horrific grammatical errors and the glaring inaccuracies. I feel guilty. I feel guilty that I allowed my IQ to fall several points while attempting to read, what can only loosely be termed, literature. Maybe the author should try attending college, before attempting to write again. Bluck, I think that might be the only word for it! She must know people in all the right places to have this much attention on such a horribly written story.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I just downloaded this game to my kindle and I love it reminds me of a game I played in school.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it reminds me of super Mario brothers. I play this often when my little one is not playing it. you should try it.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam parties it up, makes you dance, gets a little dirty then takes you deeper into his heart and soul on this amazing album.<br /><br />Trespassing stomps in and sets the rebellious mood with Queen/Michael Jackson style and groove. Funky and fresh tracks Cuckoo, Shady and Kickin In will have you grabbing your stripper heals, ready to hit the club. Naked Love and Never Close Our Eyes are great for the beach, pool party or cranking it up with the top down. Broken English, Chokehold and Runnin (delux edition) are moody and sexy with a little angst. Better Than I Know Myself and Take Back (delux edition) tackle the complicated mess of love and relationships. Outlaws of Love and Underneath are raw, hit deep and tug hard at your heart. And finishing things up with Nirvana (delux edition) soothes your soul and makes it all better.<br /><br />All these amazing songs perfectly produced with funk, electronica, a little dub step here and there, a rock edge, and all wrapped up in Adam's incredible voice. He knows when to keep the vocals restrained and controlled and knows when to unleash and let it fly. Best album I've heard in a long while. Buy it..you will NOT be sorry. I promise.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I actually like this game. I didn't think at first that I would like it, but then I started to play it. I sent it to someone else to play as well and they started to play it on their ipad and on their facebook page. I play mines on the kindle fire to get out of the game you have to press options on the kindle fire.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Interesting puzzle game. Worth the money. You can get caught up in the game and kill a lot of time. I would have given the game 5 stars, but it moves pretty slowly and can get boring. Also, a lot of the levels are just too easy. Overall, a solid game that I would recommend to people who like puzzles.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really loved this book! Great story great hot and steamy sex scenes! I've been married for 10 years and our sex life has never been better!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everything that can be said about how bad this book was written, has been voiced by other reviewers..  What I cannot understand is a woman's fascination with the story. The popularity this book is getting makes one wonder what women really want from a man.
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Game has some promise.  It's a horrible microtrans game but there's a significant amount of gameplay to be had without getting nickle and dimed to death except it crashes almost every time I try to play.
B004RC8NUQ|4.0|I really liked this movie and found it very entertaining. However, there is a dark undercurrent to it with Natalie Portman's character's trust issues so it's kind of hard to watch if you are in a bad mood, but I at least think they do a great job of acting in it, and it is a very entertaining movie if you are just looking for something fun to watch.
0762777931|5.0|The wealth of information regarding Alkaline foods, ph balance, detoxification, anti-inflammatory and gluten free is invaluable!  I am streamlining my eating habits and am feeling better and more energized!
B007CKNX28|1.0|Really wanted to like this album but after listening to it 9 or 10 times it still fails to impress. Jack White is at his best with riff-driven guitar and screechy solos. Blunderbuss (save for 16 Saltines) has little of this. The first three tracks are decent enough, then the album erodes into a mess of piano crap--it literally sounds like Liberace or Billy Joel at times. As another reviewer noted a couple of tracks even sound like they belong on a Prairie Home Companion. If you're looking for rock, don't waste your money.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|This set of blu-ray quality Star Wars Saga movies is Amazing.  I have loved the series from its start to finish and If you've ever thought to yourself \\"Wow I really wish I could watch this in HD!\\" Then this is definitely the best thing you'll ever own.  Not to mention the price on this set is really worth the movies and the behind the scenes stuff added!  MUST HAVE IF YOU'RE A STAR WARS FAN!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|The word \\"evolve\\" has been tossed around a lot lately, usually in politics. According to the Free Online Dictionary, to evolve is: \\"to develop or achieve gradually; to evolve a style of one's own\\". \\"Live\\", the newest release by the Tedeschi Trucks band is  a perfect example of musical evolution- the group has gradually changed from a song oriented collective to the type of improvisational jam band that first introduced Derek Trucks to the public.<br /><br />The Tedeschi Trucks band is unlike anyone else on the scene today. With last year's \\"Revelator\\", Susan Tedeschi and Derek gave us twelve originals (thirteen counting the hidden track \\"Ghost Light\\") where songwriting was the key, Susan's vocals and guitar embellished by Derek's masterful slide. Every member of the eleven piece band was integral to success of course, but the overall vibe was romantic and song oriented. With \\"Live\\", the band stretches out on every track, much like Derek Trucks Band's \\"Live at the Georgia Theatre\\".<br /><br />The best albums always grab you from the start. The title track, a 1969 hit for Harry Nilsson, opens with a catchy guitar riff, reminiscent of Warren Haynes' \\"Man in Motion\\". Susan has made this song her own with her impassioned reading. \\"Midnight in Harlem\\" has a couple of surprises- a \\"Swamp Raga Intro\\" is followed by the opening notes to Duane Allman's \\"Little Martha\\". The crowd roars its approval before \\"Harlem\\" kicks in.<br /><br />\\"Learn How to Love\\" is a well written original with Susan yearning of \\"tired of living without/ when others have so much/ if I could find someone/ to bring that lovin' touch\\", but the real treat here is the guitar interplay between this talented couple. Most fans are aware of Derek's abilities, but Susan matches her husband note for note on this workout.<br /><br />The Elmore James classic \\"Rollin' and Tumblin'\\" is updated, again featuring both guitars and the keyboards of Kofi Burbridge. The tandem drumming of Tyler Greenwell and J.J. Johnson, along with bassist Oteil Burbridge push the band into the tough \\"Nobody's Free\\", another original. John Sebastian's \\"Darling Be Home Soon\\" is a surprising cover, but Tedeschi Trucks have proven they can reinvent anything put in front of them.<br /><br />\\"That Did It\\" is the Pearl Woods composition made famous by Bobby Bland. I've seen Susan live and she has always delivered as a singer, but I've never heard her with the grit she displays here. The background vocals of Mike Mattison and Mark Rivers are perfect support for Susan. Stevie Wonder's \\"Uptight\\" is another great cover featuring saxophonist Kebbi Williams, trombonist Sanders Sermons and trumpeter Maurice Brown, who gets the spotlight with an extended solo. Both drummers get to stretch out, and Oteil displays his bass chops while scat singing which is his trademark when performing with the Allman Brothers.<br /><br />\\"Love Has Something to Say\\" from \\"Revelator\\" segues nicely into Bill Withers'\\"Kissing My Love\\", featuring the vocals of trombonist Sermons. Derek plays one of his best solos of the disc on this track.<br /><br />\\"Wade in the Water\\" takes us to church, where Susan and company sing the gospel with reverence. Derek answers each verse with understated slide. while Kofi Burbridge rides above it all on flute. You can't help but see the light.<br /><br />These shows were recorded over three late October nights in Toronto, Washington D.C. and Bridgeport, Connecticut. Coincidentally, the Bridgeport show was recorded on the fortieth anniversary of Duane Allman's passing. It's almost as if Duane passed the torch to Tedeschi Trucks- and they're holding it high.

B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Enjoyed the movie...could have been so much better without the hollow Vedder soundtrack..I'm sure the subject would have vomited too.
B005LAIIS0|5.0|This film was in a word amazing. All the way up until the end, and especially the end, the emotions were flying and the audience didn't know what would happen yet. Yes, I was a bit shocked when the credits started to roll, but even when I came out of the theater and was deciding dinner plans with my friends, the true meaning of the ending dawned on me and I instantly fell in love with the film and wanted to go back the next day. Liam Neeson is rapidly becoming one of my to 3 favorite actors and one of the main reasons is due to this extremely well-crafted film.
B004M5HUXE|5.0|Wonderful and quick service!  I thought the book was wonderful...never read it before!  Helped me to compare with liturature I am currently reading; interesting to see how different styles affect the material! I LOVE my Kindle!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The positive reaction to this book is disturbing. I agree with other reviewers that said it's repetitive, formulaic, and poorly written.  I think that the author is just trying to follow in the nouveau riche footsteps of J.K. Rowling and who wrote \\"Twilight\\" again- Stephanie Something? I don't understand how women over the age of 25 can at all identify with the characters, particularly Ana. A 21 year old virgin? Really? And multiple orgasms from someone who hasn't even so much as masterbated?  The most striking is the similarity to this book and the movie \\"91/2 Weeks\\" with Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger-from the 80s.  The characters aren't exact, but the story line is very close. And the language-what 20-something talks like that? Even educated 20-somethings don't!  This book is played out, trite, and quite frankly, I am embarrassed that womem-SMART women-are falling for this load of crap (triple crap! -see: overused expression from the book). And don't even get me started on the overt sexual violence that takes place. I'm quite sure we can find Mr. Grey on the Power and Control Wheel of Domestic Violence. The author does nothing to make these characters appealing, likeable, or interesting, and I found myself not caring one bit about their journeys in life. The only cool part was Mr. Grey's fleet of Audis.

140053271X|1.0|I purchased the kindle because I thought that it would be easier to get service at B&N, as well as the basic version because it might have less issues.  I was wrong.  While some people might have gotten a good nook, I got the worst one imaginable.  I am unable to get the books that I purchased on to my nook, unless I am plugged into my computer and put them on manually.  It constantly freezes, sometimes 5 plus times a night.  Whenever I call they have me go to the store, and when I go to the store they have me call.  It is the worst service I have ever received, the nook rarely works the way it should, and every night when I am trying to read in bed, and think towards the money that I am saving up to buy a Kindle.<br /><br />Do yourselves a favor, and DO NOT BUY A NOOK!  If you get the one that doesn't work, it is impossible to remedy, and you are out a bunch of money.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Awesome album, definitely one of the Foo's finest.  Dave Grohl and the gang shred on this one.  Just goes to show what old-school performances and production can bring to make it rock.  It was recorded in Dave's garage for God's sake!!!
B003Y5HWGI|1.0|Very disappointed in the seventh season of Desperate Housewives.  I returned my first purchase.  My second purchase was fine until the last disc.  I can't watch it.  I keep getting the message that it's a bad disc.  Probably won't be buying any more from Amazon.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love it, this is one of the funnest games of the year. It is almost as addictive as angry birds.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Was this the most horrible book that I've ever read? No. The plot in of itself wasn't a bad one and if the characters were less complex, I think it could have had a shot. I did enjoy some of the witty banter back and forth between the characters but I had to admit that I have a bit of whiplash.<br /><br />This book has too many unbelievable elements. The characters don't seem to react in any consistent manner (unless you touch his chest, heaven forbid that you touch his chest!). The Hero seems to have many problems and then is magically over them, without any push or inner battle whatsoever (at least from what the reader can tell). The Heroine seems to have knowledge about the darker aspects of the book, though is completely innocent. The Hero is angry, then happy, then moody, then playful, and then hurt . . . all within the span of a page.<br /><br />Maybe there was just too much hype about this book but it did not live up to what I was expecting. Maybe the second book is better since this was her first book and they are normally a little rough but I won't be picking it up anytime soon.<br /><br />Oh. . . 'Inner Goddess' and 'Subconscious' were WAY overdone, I was 'rolling my eyes' and 'biting my lip' halfway through the book.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I got this book and the other 2 to see what all the hoopla was about, well I still don't know. This book was banned for what reason? There are a lot of books out that are way more erotic than this, and I was kind of disappointed that the scenes were not as graphic as I like. I was sad the way the book ended because she was so sad and pissed to say the least. i think most people who don't have sex or don't understand the meaning behind a dom/sub relationship may not like the book or understand how he can make her do things and react to him as she does. I understanding it from reading about it so it was comical to me. Well I'm on to book 2. Happy reading.

B0053O89JM|4.0|\\"House, M.D. November 16, 2004 - May 21, 2012<br /><br />I love this show and will always be a fan of the series, but it has continuously been going downhill and I must admit has not been on my favorites list. Although \\"HOUSE, M.D.\\" had a great run, I felt it lost everything that once made it such an outstanding show... a couple seasons ago.<br /><br />Aside from the previous comments, I will miss this show for three reasons. One being, it was once a spectacular series and it's sad to see it end without returning to its original glory. Two, the interaction between House and Wilson has always been a big highlight of the show, to me. Lastly, I will miss Hugh Laurie. I feel no one could have played a better Dr. Gregory House.<br /><br />All and all, I recommend season eight if you are a fan and want to follow the show until the end.
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson has really out done herself with this album. Every song a winner. After Stronger I love Dark Side the best. There is so much meaning in these songs, not just for the ladies but turn it around and it works for the guys too. I'm a guy and I could really relate to the words in her songs, I've been there. I have quit a bit of female favorites but at the top of that list is Kelly. She seems to be able to put all her feelings into a song and make us feel it as well. My suggestion is buy this album now, right now! You won't regret it.

0307951529|4.0|I would recommend The $100 startup to the person who has not read a lot of business books, or is unfamiliar with the possibilities of online entrepreneurship today. If you are a frequent reader of business books & blogs, you will likely not find much new here--but that is not really the point.<br /><br />Like many Seth Godin books, this book is about inspiration to show you what's possible. While Chris interviewed lots of entrepreneurs, the case studies are limited in depth of details. Rather the $100 Startup will give you the broad strokes to get started--more strategy, vs getting wrapped up in tactics.<br /><br />I should mention that not all businesses profiled were created for $100. Some were. Some for less. Some for much more. But through the case studies, you will see what is most appropriate to your situation and goals.

I've been reading Sci Fi for over 40 years and I know the good stuff and the bad stuff, so trust me when I say this book is very good, leaning towards fantastic.<br /><br />Finally for the author:  You could charge more for this and I would not feel cheated. Not that I want you to DO that, I'm just sayin'.
0375842209|5.0|Review 7 out of 5<br /><br />I will start by saying that I had never heard of The Book Thief before I was given a copy to read for World Book Night. It was a serious oversight on my part! It is a FANTASTIC book!<br />This book is narrated by Death. I was so used to reading a straight story, that it took me a while to get used to the lack of dialogue. I'm not saying there was no dialogue, just not the \\"he said, she said\\" variety. Once I got used to the \\"voice\\" telling the story, I found myself caught up in the tale of a nine-year-old girl growing up in a time of war and hardship.<br />Liesel is a great character, full of independence and spirit that made me like her. She's a fighter. She stands up for what she believes. This is an extremely dangerous thing to do in Nazi Germany, but it made me cheer for her.<br />There are also some great characters living on Himmel Street. Rudy Steiner is Liesel's best friend and ally. They get up to all sorts - thievery being one of them!<br />Then there is Mama and Papa, Liesel's foster parents. Mama has a sharp tongue, but she hides a huge heart. Papa is the first person to break through Liesel's defences, and it's his love and attention that makes her love the written word, as well as him.<br />Then there is Max Vandenberg, a Jew. He has a profound affect on not only Liesel, but myself.<br />Death is present through the whole book, and as he narrates the story of The Book Thief, he bring's his own unique outlook to a brutal time. I actually liked Death, he is witty and very observant. There is a saying, \\"It's a dirty job, but someone's got to do it\\" and it definitely applies to him.<br />There is also another saying, \\"The pen is mightier than the sword\\" and in the case of The Book Thief, it is certainly true. Words, whether spoken or written, can have the most profound affect. They can build worlds, or destroy them. I have thoroughly enjoyed reading The Book Thief, and if you haven't read it yet, I highly recommend that you do so. It is a book full of emotion - love, loss, joy, anger, fervour and sadness, but it is the lasting legacy of words that will stay with me forever.o.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|FEARLESS: The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown by author Eric Blehm is a most captivating and gripping story captured with emotion and detail. A hard book to put down, and even harder to read without shedding tears.<br /><br />The Navy SEALS is one of the most elite military teams in the world. It's the envy of most boys, and have been the foundation of many fictional characters in novels. But there's no fiction in this book.<br /><br />Christian, Warrior, Navy SEAL, and American HERO, Chief Adam Brown, in his final act of bravery, died trying to engage enemy fire away from his team who were pinned down and under heavy gunfire. In doing this, he saved the lives of his unit but paid the ultimate price. Chief Brown's team was able to eliminate all the combatants who were shooting at them.<br /><br />The author introduces the reader to Adam prior to joining the military and describes how he was always an adventurous individual and daredevil - from jumping off bridges into lakes to jumping off roofs into trees, Adam was 'Fearless'.<br /><br />Several months after Adam was killed serving his country, most of his unit also died when their Chinook was shot down in August 2011, in Afghanistan.<br /><br />I commend the author on this well written book, and have prayed for Adam's wife, children and family. Blessings to all the men and women in uniform.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|The story of the Vel d'Hiv roundup was very compelling and well told.  The story of the present day reporter and her family - not so much.  I enjoyed 2/3rds of the book and was very much let down by the end. It was a silly melodramatic harlequin romance ending. It tainted the whole reading experience for me.

0525425764|5.0|Theodore Boone: The Accused by John Grisham, ISBN 978-0-525-42576-2, Dutton Children's Group, A Branch of the Penguin Youth Group:  It is a #1 New York Times Bestseller- or the third installment in a bestselling series from who else by John Grisham. The first two books, Theodore Boone: kid lawyer and Theodore Boone: the abduction,  were touted as being superb and fantastic, and there was no lie about that, and this one, is just as good. Though fruitfully written for children and young readers, The Accused can capture the attention of those over the age of 30 and be a good story. And having the main character as a nosy, too smart for his britches kid named Theodore just was the icing on the cake. The story keeps one, no matter your age, turning the pages, cheering for, fearing for and encouraging Theo as he investigates, searches and goes about protecting the innocent. In The Accused, Theo becomes the target of a revenge scheme that really doesn't involve him but his mom  - a divorce lawyer.<br /><br />The ending takes you by surprise, but you will end up cheering and wanting more from Theo.

B004LWZW88|5.0|Here's another funny cartoon from DreamWorks, along the same lines as their others such as \\"Shrek\\", \\"Madagascar,\\" \\"Kung Fu Panda\\", etc. By now you probably now what to expect - lots of funny dialog, goofy antics from anthropomorphic animals, and a basic lesson to be learned. The title character Puss in Boots is of course from the Shrek movies. They flesh out his character and history more here and add others such as Humpty Dumpty, the ex-best friend, and Kitty Softpaws, a female romantic interest for Puss.<br /><br />Puss, Humpty, and Kitty conspire to steal magic beans so they can grow the beanstalk and take the goose that lays golden eggs. Puss is doing it so he can right a wrong - he wants to pay back the town which he unintentionally betrayed. Humpty has seemingly been obsessed with finding the magic beans since he was very young, and he's brought Kitty along as a master thief. Puss was best friends with Humpty years ago until Humpty betrayed him, so he enters into this new alliance somewhat uneasily.<br /><br />In addition to the movie, the discs include a new short film featuring Puss. It's less than half an hour long but extremely funny. Puss ends up with three kittens to oversee and they're a lot more trouble than they look. Much like the movie itself, there were many little details that, as a cat owner, I especially found humor in because the behavior is so like a real cat. You by no means need to be a cat lover to enjoy these films though.

B0052VUNHC|3.0|After reading the \\"Fifty Shades\\" series, this book came up as a recommendation. While I enjoyed it, there was a lot left to be desired. I enjoyed the obvious attraction (and sexual tension) between Abby & Travis and the plot line regarding Abby's past was an interesting twist.<br /><br />I had a hard time looking at this story without wondering how many readers are going to see a bad boy like Travis in the real world and think he's going to change for her? While I'm all about losing yourself in fiction, I also remember being 19 and having a completely skewed sense of what love is all about. And love is not someone who essentially stalks you after you break up or hits men who buy you drinks or dance with you. It just seemed a little bit...irresponsible (for lack of a better word) of the author to write a novel aimed at young adults that could make them think that sort of relationship is somehow acceptable. Once again, I'm not saying that readers can't distinguish between fiction and reality, but it's easy lose yourself in the idea of having someone so completely devoted and desperately in love with you that it becomes an ideal. And the arguing...it seemed like it was constant between all the characters.<br /><br />While I'll admit I may be a little jaded, it was overall a decent read. The plot line was interesting enough but the characters lacked quite a bit of the emotional maturity and depth for me to give it more than 3 stars.
B007MAETA8|5.0|This is a very relaxing album.  You can tune it out if you have to.  It has a very mellow feel.  It reminds me a lot of Mayers first album. The only difference in the new and old album is the fact that the new albums songs have more sound and more going on, but never to much.  The first CD was very simple, and that is one of the things that made it so great.  If you listen to the first CD, then this, I think they go together.  You can see him step to the next level.  It also has a cool country feel.  It really reminds of old country.  When country was good and sounded unique.  This was a great buy for the fact that it is full of great music and it was 10 dollars!!!!

0307730697|4.0|I'd rate the audiobook version of \\"Fearless\\" 3-and-a-half stars if I could, so I've opted to give it the nudge up to 4 stars given Eric Blehm's scrupulous commitment to the book's background research.<br /><br />The book's primary emphasis is on Adam's life and marriage as a Navy SEAL although his entire life is covered. Adam's death would come several months before SEAL Team 6 killed Osama bin Laden. Eric Blehm traveled from coast to coast to interview the men of SEAL Team 6 Adam trained with, deployed in combat and socialized with.<br /><br />Blem's meticulous, comprehensive research is excellent. The information Adam's fellow SEALs were able to provide about training exercises and SEAL deployments is remarkable and the book reflects this. The last operation leading up to and including Adam's death is as detailed and thorough as it could have been.<br /><br />Paul Michael's narration is clear and well-paced albeit undistinguished and the quality of the audio is professional. There is some profanity as one would expect within a group of NAVY Seals though it is on the periphery and not pervasive.<br /><br />DISCLOSURE: I received this audiobook free through the review program at Christianaudio.com  I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.

B007MAETA8|4.0|In a nutshell: Do you have any other John Mayer CDs? Do you like it? Then get this one as well and enjoy it just as much. The man knows how to unearth a catchy melody, and fortunately his creative well has not yet run dry.<br /><br />It is a rare rare rare musician who is as consistent as John has been to date in his writing. Most bands who have stood the test of time have put out a mediocre or worse album by this time in their career. U2, Neil Young, Allman Bros, Clapton, Dylan, Bruce, Dave Matthews, etc. But John has yet to go thru that phase where his writing (either lyrically or compositionally) have taken a back seat to just needing to release something by a certain date. No filler to speak of here, though some songs stand out more than others. John remains true and integerous to his art from start to finish. No wild experimentation that falls short, misses the mark or leaves you wondering `WTF?!' here.<br /><br />Having said that, Born and Raised does set itself apart from his previous efforts in some interesting ways. This is his most introspective release to date (which is saying something since he has always looked inward when writing). Fortunately, Don Was knew how to approach this prevalent pensiveness. The songs are quite stripped down production wise almost like, but not to the same degree that, Rick Rubin approached Johnny Cash's last few recordings. Percussion throughout is almost non-existent, save a background snare and bass for rhythm purposes on occasion. The songs rely, appropriately, on the songwriting itself and not mind-blowing musicianship. While we might miss it, this is not a showcase album for John's brilliant guitar work as we have seen in the past. Here we simply find an individual inviting us to listen to his thoughts about himself (Shadow Days - the song most reminiscent of previous Mayer melodies & Born and Raised - a sing-along echoing with Dixieland piano and peddle-steel guitar) and stories about others (Queen of California - which(among some other songs on the CD) channels J.J. Cale that your foot must tap along to & Walt Grace's Submarine Test - a symphonic vaudeville like song that could be argued is 1 of 2 tracks that doesn't quite fit musically with the rest, but might be giving us a glimpse into where he is headed next).<br /><br />What John went through via his Playboy interview fallout a few years back and the daunting task of keeping an uncooperative ego in check sets the stage for some of his lyrics and certainly his musical approach overall (John sold his New York and L.A. homes and bought a ranch in Montanna where he now lives). As a skilled producer, D. Was is well aware of this change in Mayer, thus his minimalistic production approach.<br /><br />Oddly enough though, this CD does not seem THAT different from previous Mayer releases. Though much more country and less blues, the sound, style and sensibility are still unmistakably J.M. Most of these songs will fit in nicely to his touring repertoire in between heavier and louder selections in the set.<br /><br />What I noted was the light banjo and Hammond B3 organ in many places; the harmonica that is front and center from time to time; and a lack of electric guitar where you would have heard it on Continuum and Battle Studies. And what brought a personal smile to my face was listening to Born and Raised & Speak For Me and having to make sure these were not Neil Young covers from the [[ASIN:B00009P1NY American Stars N Bars]]/[[ASIN:B00004VW35 Old Ways]] era. No question here that John decided to take a break from his Clapton worship and looked to a laid back country style Neil for some inspiration (I understand Crosby and Stills contribute on the album as does Greg Allman). Very fitting indeed!<br /><br />So again, youre wondering if this CD is worth your time. If you have found any other Mayer CD enjoyable then there is no question youre going to end up keeping this one in steady rotation just as much.  If you are wondering which should be your first Mayer CD purchase, you certainly wont go wrong with this one if youre more on the mellow side. If youre looking for his guitar handiwork I would suggest Continuum or Battle Studies instead.

B007N3A2F0|4.0|I've always been a very huge fan of Sonata Arctica,and this album doesn't fail to catch delight in my ears. First Off- Tracks: (A select Few,not all of them) Cinderblox: An interesting mixof folk country and symphonic metal,certainly a decent song, though it does feel a bit out of place.<br /><br />Wildfire II: One with the Mountain: A fairly powerful song,though not in the same line as Wildfire (Reckoning Day,Reckoning Night). It has solid lyrics and content,though is closer to The Boy Who Wanted to Be a Real Puppet in terms of its pace and overall soundplay.<br /><br />Wildfire III: A great deal like II,same basic background,though some of the middle draws parallels to Don't Say a Word.<br /><br />I Have a Right: Released as a Single-(I'd consider it to be more like Under your Tree than anything else)<br /><br />S~~~load of Money: Very ah,interesting track... This feels like more of their older work and has its own story,more or less revenge like Paid in Full but darker.<br /><br />(Not going to outline every song.)<br /><br />I feel that this new path (kind of new,started with Unia) is interesting,as Kakko draws Influence from his Fiance as well as from his Love for the Environment.<br /><br />Don't Get me Wrong,I do enjoy the album a great deal. The main problem here is the lack of... metal? It seems the album overall is a continuation of the departure from Silence and the early days and is very much akin to Unia in its songs. Will it grow on me like Unia did? Probably. I'll buy it,as most fans will,but to recommend for anyone to buy it,well that is more of a question of what are you looking for in the album. If you liked Unia,you'll like this.

B002ZG999U|3.0|\\"The Expendables\\" is an action film that's less about the action and more about the 80s retread cast.  Where else can Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) and Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren) face off once more? Or watch Jet Li face off against Lundgren? Or witness Jason Statham compete in a knife throwing contest with Stallone? Or watch Mickey Rourke lecture Stallone? Or listen to Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Stallone quip wise in a church? Nowhere else!  Depending on whether or not you find these kinds of face-offs intriguing will determine your level of interest in this film.<br /><br />That's it.  The characters' names and back stories mean less to the film than the actors themselves, whose legendary oeuvre make it impossible to see them as anything else. This is not a film where Jet Li plays the demolitions expert and Stallone is the martial artist.  Everyone fits comfortably back into their own roles like a well-worn glove and embraces it with gusto as they take on the actor known for arch-villainy across all of Syfy-dom, Eric Roberts.<br /><br />Our motley team of mercenaries belongs to a biker gang known as The Expendables, based in New Orleans. There's the leader Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), stabby guy Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), martial artist Yin Yang (Jet Li), sniper Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), heavy weapons guy Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) and blow-things-up guy Toll Road (Randy Couture). Their workaday rhythm of blasting bad guys goes south when Jensen loses it during a mission and Christmas discovers his girlfriend (Charisma Carpenter) has left him for another man. That's what passes for character development.<br /><br />In an aging warrior dialogue reminiscent of Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns,\\" Ross wears his military mantle with a heavy brow.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I love reading first of all and I am attracted to books that are a series or trilogies. I like to stay with characters for awhile. I did not know what genre this book was before I decided to read it.  Once I heard trilogy, I was sold. That said, Fifty Shades of Grey is not a well written book, it is right up there with Twilight. It is simple and super repetitive.  But, the story line intrigued me and I kept reading.  I have read other reviews with people saying that they can't understand why this book is on the New York Times best-seller list.  Best-seller means what it says, the book has sold a lot.  It doesn't mean that the New York Times is saying it is on the Best-written list.  And did people forget the saying \\"Sex sells?\\" Hello, that is why Fifty Shades of Grey is on the Best-seller list.  The author and the publishing company are not stupid. They know sex sells.  People love to talk about it, have it, and read about it.  It is everywhere.  Even if you are a prude you are talking about because if you want to ban it you have say why.  The issue isn't really the subject matter but the poor writing.  If a great writer had a hold of this subject matter it would blow your head off. There are writers out there right now that amaze you with a simple sensual scene in their books. Fifty Shades of Grey is missing the simple use of the five senses and the author really needed a Thesaurus to reference.  Plus, the editor of this book needed a real-life Christian Grey to spank them for doing such a poor job with all the repetitive and misspelled words.
B007O3QC8K|5.0|Not only does Sir Simon Rattle embolden an orchestra in the concert hall to rise to his lofty ideas about the music of Anton Bruckner (he recently guest conducted the Los Angeles Philharmonic in this mighty, death haunted Symphony No. 9 - but in the traditional three movement form), but he also seeks to expand the appreciation of the great Bruckner by making it possible to evaluate the `completed form' of Bruckner's last symphony, and it is that that he elected to record after the rather tumultuous reception in his performance in Berlin with his own Berlin Philharmonic.<br /><br />Although Bruckner died after completing only three of the four movements, the Berliners give the premiere of a Finale reconstructed by Nicola Samale, John A. Phillips, Benjamin-Gunnar Cohrs, and Giuseppe Mazzuca (\\"SPCM\\").  This is one of the great musicological undertakings of modern times, involving over twenty years of research and analysis of the sketches.  The result overturns the conventional wisdom that Bruckner only completed fragments of the Finale, and restores some astounding passages of music, some of his greatest. While there is undeniable logicality in the endless climbing repetitions and the echoes of the vaunting Wagnerian touches from the first movement, the added movement does tend to detract from the particularly fine treatment of the third movement Adagio.<br /><br />The Berlin Philharmonic plays beautifully, as expected.  The blend of the strings in pianissimo is a wonder to hear, and the brasses are balanced within the orchestra even at their loudest.  As a result, full orchestra fortissimos have depth as well as volume.  It goes without saying that Rattle is a superb conductor.  Nuances abounded in this beautiful performance; for instance, he has the strings drop to a mere whisper at the second strain of the first movement's lyrical second theme.  Perhaps the climaxes of the first movement, and the Scherzo, lack the last degree of vehemence and violence found in the very best performances of the past.  But in the coda to the first movement, and in the Adagio, the playing is on another level, magnificently focused and vividly characterized.<br /><br />Does the presence of the fourth reconstituted movement add substantially to the symphony as a whole?  That is a very personal decision.  For this listener having the symphony end with the Adagio allows the symphony to suggest what is beyond death, and at least for the moment, that seems more than enough. A spellbinding performance, this.  Grady Harp, May 12ery best performances of the past.

For an early 20th century organized crime buff like myself, this was made to order. Grand, authentic  sets of the 1920s Altantic City Boardwalk.  Al Capone, Arnold Rothstein, Big Jim Collosimo, Lucky Luciano, Frankie Yale, and others appear early in their \\"careers.\\"  Veterans, traumatized and numbed to the killing in the WWI trenches, join the criminal empire to utilize their newly acquired \\"skills.\\" The dialogue is tight, the characters are fantastic.  I will definitely order Season 2 as soon as it is released!
0345803507|5.0|All three book in this series were amazing.  There have been so much talk about the sex in these books I had to see for myself  what all the to do was about.  If that is all you get out of these three books you are missing the mark totally.  The story line of these books were funny, and at times totally heat breaking and the twist and turns keep you guessing.  I thought all three books rocked! I didn't want it to end.

0345803485|5.0|This book is different from anything I have ever read but I like it. If you can get past all the sex, it really is a story about a passionate, romantic love affair. It's like The Notebook on steroids. What I am really interested in now is, if they make a movie of it, who is gonna play these characters. I really picture Matt Bohmer as Christian and Nina Dobrev as Ana Steele. I mean, who can really look away when two gorgeous people like that get together?!<br /><br />For all the people who hate on these books...lighten up! It's meant to be a fantasy book and a real nice escape for women from boring everyday life. Every girl fantasizes about meeting an extremely gorgeous and wealthy guy who ends up sweeping us off our feet.

B006QKJQM6|4.0|While anticipating watching the second Kung Fu Panda movie, I had fond memories of the first one and how light and funny it was.  There were heros and a villan making the story itself pretty standard fare.  The fun part was getting the character's defined, building up to a final, victorious showdown.  Well, Kung Fu Panda 2, was not the same; not at all.  I found it to be a very disjointed story, a little difficult to follow, and it also had more than one story going on.  Plus it seemed to me that half of the show was dark in theme and also too many scenes shown in Literal darkness.  I still enjoyed the movie, but would not advise trying to get a child under the age of 8 to sit through it!

B0078N2MTE|5.0|This is the first movie I have watched in years that took me to an emotionally uncomfortable place yet kept me absolutely glued to the screen throughout the entire movie.  I was just taking a chance on this one, after watching the trailer and seeing the visual effects, it was a why not? choice. Shortly after the movie began though, I was hooked until the very last scenes.  It is a great psychological thriller as well as having some really good special effects, which are added at points to maximize the tension.  This movie surprised me by taking me from the point of being almost bored to being really frightened many times through the movie. In the end I was just outright intrigued, engaged and mesmerized by it.  Even the ending left me a little unsure whether I had just seen one of the best movies ever, or one of the worst! But since I have told everyone I know to watch this movie, I'm coming down on the side of a great movie.  For people who like to be cerebrally engaged with a story, with some good special effects, and plenty of twists and turns I highly recommend this movie.  But if you just want big name stars, action, CGI effects, and a good simple plot, it will not be the movie for you!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read as much as the kindle 'sample' contained, and agree with so many of the reviews on here.  Even the 50 pages or so that I read, were so repetitive and unbelievable.  I know a 'sample' does not consitute a complete book but I am glad that I did not buy this book.
B0081J95TE|4.0|Garbage took an interesting path after releasing Version 2.0 in 1998.  Beautiful Garbage tilted the balance of rock and electronica more toward the DJ spectrum followed by the more mainstream Bleed Like Me.  Not Your Kind of People sounds like it could have been the natural successor to Version 2.0.  This is most evident in the opening of \\"Battle In Me\\" which you could mistake for \\"Push It\\" before it goes in its own direction.  Other tracks that share that vintage sound are \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\", \\"Big Bright World\\", and \\"I Hate Love\\".  Shirley Manson still sings with plenty of angst as shown on lines from both the driven \\"Control\\" (It's always darkest before the dawn) and the groovy \\"Sugar\\" (Won't someone love me?  Won't someone love me like you?).  However the closing song \\"Beloved Freak\\" brings Not Your Kind of People to a very subdued close.  Here we find a gentle delivery that includes the line (You're not alone).  It seems that Garbage want to leave us with a glimmer of sunshine after a fun return to 90's grunge fueled angst.  I would recommend Not Your Kind of People to all Garbage fans.<br /><br />You may be wondering whether you should spring for the \\"Deluxe Edition\\" or not.  My leaning (although not overly strong) would be on the \\"no\\" side.  Unlike other such expanded editions such as Evanescence's from last year, the additional tracks on Not Your Kind of People really seem like leftovers that were rightly left on the cutting room floor.  \\"What Girls Are Made Of\\" is salty, but it seems to be so merely for the sake of being salty.  \\"Bright Tonight\\" is rather bland when compared to the main tracks.  \\"The One\\" and \\"Show Me\\" are OK, but I would suggest buying these tracks and dropping them in the folder with the regular edition if you are so inclined.<br /><br />Download this:  Battle In Me

B007ZMD14I|4.0|Slash is one of my favorite guitarists of all time, and I've enjoyed his work since the opening line of Appetite for Destruction through the end of Libertad.  However, I've just recently started getting into his solo work.  I found Apocalyptic Love to a good addition to Slash's overall body of work.<br /><br />This album is at its best on \\"Anastasia\\".  It opens with a brief classical guitar intro before transitioning to a classic Slash riff.  The song also has not one but two solos that remind us why Slash is great.  The mid-tempo lead single \\"You're A Lie\\" is full of hooks, and Slash's underlying riff on the second verse adds nice texture.  The solo is on the mellow side, but it is Slash all the way.  I thought that \\"Apocalyptic Love\\", \\"Standing In The Sun\\", \\"Shots Fired\\", and \\"Crazy Life\\" also had great solos and guitar work.<br /><br />Myles Kennedy is a pretty middle of the road vocalist, but he has some hits and misses on this CD.  On some songs (\\"One Last Thrill\\", \\"Halo\\", and \\"Bad Rain\\") he wanders into vocal delivery that could only be characterized as whiny.  However, he does pretty well on the rest of the CD, and I would even say that he is better than average on a few songs (\\"Anastasia\\", \\"Crazy Life\\", and \\"Far And Away\\").<br /><br />Apocalyptic Love has some very catchy music, and I heard some interesting influences come through.  On \\"Standing In The Sun\\" the opening instrumental line called to mind Led Zeppelin's \\"Immigrant Song\\" while \\"Crazy Life\\" has a vocal structure that made me think of Aerosmith's \\"Walk This Way\\".  For something a little more recent \\"Not For Me\\" seems similar to the Foo Fighter's \\"I Should Have Known\\".  Finally, \\"Standing In The Sun\\" opens in a way that many will find similar to instrumental sections of Guns `N Roses' \\"Paradise City\\".<br /><br />Overall, I think Apocalyptic Love is a pretty good album.  The thing that keeps it from being worthy of five stars is the sometimes erratic vocal delivery of Myles Kennedy.  Slash continues to do his thing, and he does it quite well.  If you can't imagine Slash doing anything of value outside of Guns N' Roses, you will want to skip this one.  Otherwise, what are you waiting for?  Enjoy some good tunes from one of the best guitarists of our time.<br /><br />Download this:  Anastasiato do his thing, and he does it quite well.

0060775858|5.0|This book wasn't in our personal library when my daughter was born in 1975 in CA and most often I made up stories for her. She was reading at three so whatever I did it must have been productive, intellectually, for her. When I first saw this, she was a teenager and not interested in such childish things (although she still loved the stories I created for her). When she and my son-in-law gave birth to their first child in March of this year, I knew it was something that was going to be a part of her life. The day it arrived my daughter called to say \\"guess who fell asleep after being read a certain book?\\". Of course we know at one month just the sound of her mother's voice was the trick that put her to sleep but as the months progress, this book will follow in the history of \\"Pat the Bunny\\" and soon she will be reading by memory, then by recognition, word by word.<br /><br />A beautiful, other-worldly story.

0307455874|3.0|As a conservative, I read Obama's book because I think it is important to read and be open to opposing viewpoints.  That being said, I don't think Hope is a particularly good book, though it is not a bad book either.  What's funny about it is that for such a grand title as \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\" it's really mostly  about politics as usual.  Obama takes regular criticism that he is always campaigning, and that is what it feels like through many passages.  Even with chapter headings like \\"Faith,\\" \\"Race,\\" and \\"Values,\\" it still mainly feels like an outlet to express his positions on all the major issues.<br /><br />The parts where he shined were when he spoke personally about his family, his upbringing and his personal connection to Indonesia (along with a brief history of modern Indonesia).  Those were covered mainly in the last two chapters, entitled \\"The World Beyond Our Borders,\\" and \\"Family,\\" which I thought were the best.  I also enjoyed when he discussed the ugliness of politics and gave some personal views of the inner workings of the Senate, as well as the unlikely camaraderie that exists between senators with opposing viewpoints.<br /><br />Overall, an enjoyable book when Obama was sharing his personal history and insider viewpoints, but I could have gotten all of the politicking from the daily headlines.
0345803485|1.0|I had many things I wanted to say about this book, but I would be repeating other reviewers, so I'll keep this short. I could barely finish it - kept putting it down for a day or two, then picking it back up HOPING it would turn into a better read. This book is, in short, a classic example of a formula book. And don't get me wrong, I have nothing against formula books - some are actually pretty entertaining. But this?<br /><br />If you are interested in a book that reads like a combination of first-time-author-Harlequin and Penthouse forum, then this IS the book for you. Pretty bad when you become bored with the erotica that is written - even worse when you skip over them entirely, searching in vain for an actual credible story.<br /><br />In general, I try to support the budding writer, but how this pile of drivel made it to the New York Time's Bestsellers List is totally (and I mean totally!) beyond me.  Now if you're interested in books that actually have a good plot, with believable characters, I recommend Linda Howard. Her stories are \\"spicy\\" too, but her sex scenes are NOT used as filler, so someone can simply pump out a trilogy.<br /><br />After reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I felt cheated.

He has set out the law comprehensively and he has also provided a valuable series of insights into the arguments over where the law could be developed further through the appellate process (although he does apologize for the length of the book at just under 800 pages- no apology needed!)<br /><br />The Legal Action Group (LAG) are, as ever, a reliable and knowledgeable publisher with titles of great assistance to those acting for the Defence and this book is no exception. It offers literally a wealth of plain, practical advice which should save you a lot of time and money in the event of representation in these special matters. And it should certainly steer you in the direction of the type of questions you need to consider for your client's defence.<br /><br />Usefully, the book also contains ample resources for additional research including tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments as well as an excellent list of abbreviations and detailed index. The contents list at the front of the book facilitates looking things up when you're in a hurry.<br /><br />By setting out the civil and criminal legal framework, largely governed by the mental health legislation, and the interaction of UK legislation with the European Convention on Human Rights, defence advocates are very well catered for. We found coverage of all aspects of the legal process from initial contact with the client through to procedure and evidence extremely helpful.<br /><br />There are six parts to the book starting with introductory matters and running through pre-court matters, procedure and evidence and the substantive criminal law interface with mental disorder, and finally a review of sentencing and post-sentencing matters.<br /><br />The footnotes are, in the main, of use for further research into particular cases, so it is very much a detailed statement for a special jurisdiction dealing with special clients in a most sensitive and informative way... and it is very well done, too!lient through to procedure and evidence extremely helpful.<br /><br />There are six parts to the book starting with introductory matters and running through pre-court matters, procedure and evidence and the substantive criminal law interface with mental disorder, and finally a review of sentencing and post-sentencing matters.<br /><br />The footnotes are, in the main, of use for further research into particular cases, so it is very much a detailed statement for a special jurisdiction dealing with special clients in a most sensitive and informative way... and it is very well done, too!

GET THE NEW EDITION OF \\"GURRY\\" TODAY!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />All hail the advent of the new Gurry's!  This second edition from the Oxford University Press is released at a challenging time in the development of this newly emerging, newly significant and newly topical area of law.<br /><br />Just how significant is reflected by recent newsworthy events in the middle of 2012 - the controversies surrounding super-injunctions and of course the current, at the time of writing, storm clouds hovering over the ex-editor of \\"The News of the World\\" and \\"The Sun\\".<br /><br />Actions for a breach of confidence concern a number of areas, from trade secrets, informational privacy and governmental data, to trade secrets being of primary economic importance.<br /><br />And, as the authors point out, the law of confidentiality's most important role lies in the ability to bring an action through the courts, adding that `there does not appear to be any shortage of litigation.'<br /><br />This new edition incorporates and closely examines the numerous and diverse developments that have taken place in communications technology, as well as the law since the publication of the first edition in 1984, notably the IT revolution and  implementation of the Human Rights Act 1998 in October 2000.  Referring to the resulting `swathe of jurisprudence about the extent to which privacy is protected in English law,' the authors point up the distinction between the law of confidence with respect to (a) trade secrets and (b) matters of private information.<br /><br />Behind all this is the general principle perceived by laymen that confidential information should be kept confidential... or else!  Considering this, one can also discern the clash of interests that can ensue between those who wish to protect certain information and those who want it revealed in the public interest; whistle blowers for example and the mighty armies of journalists, most of whom, it must be said, are teeth-grindingly committed to the principles of free speech.  Bearing in mind these and related issues, the publication of this new edition of \\"Gurry\\" is topical and timely.<br /><br />The second edition is, of course, lengthier than the first, with new chapters added on the history of breach of confidence, as well as justifications for protection... confidentiality and the State... standing... and public and private international law. As Francis Gurry has said, the law is one place which reveals the qualitative value of information, adding that even if it is less than knowledge, information is more than data and its transmission or sharing can have significant economic, social and political consequences.<br /><br />He adds further that, `technology has made information precarious' -- hence the pressing need for this carefully researched and very accessible work of reference.<br /><br />Practitioners and those undertaking research within this area of law will certainly find useful the detailed and extensive resources contained in this volume - including the approximately seventy-five pages of tables of UK legislation...

0345803493|4.0|Book 1 was pretty good because it has shock value.  What I found in book 1 versus book 2 is that Ana does a lot of compromising for Grey.  In book 2, Grey does a lot of compromising for Ana. Between the steamy scenes, there is a real story line and by the end of book 2, I was looking for the real story line. Grey is crazy but he is hot.  I picture Ana being cute.  But I rolled my eyes everytime I read \\"Inner Goddess\\".<br /><br />Overall a good read and I really look forward to book 3. I hope Grey doesn't lose his edge.

0345529057|5.0|Very well presented package. The books are nice & long with much more detail & character developement than the tv series. I don't usually read fantasy, but this story has caught me. It will probably be one of the ones I read every year. I rate it 5 stars, in the league with The Stand, The Dark Tower Series, Lucifer's Hammer, Earth Abides, Alas Babylon, & The Source.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I was very surprised with the thickness of the blade of this knife, in addition to its hardness and sharp edge.<br />Its sheath is well made and comes with a hard inner cover for safety plus the extra pocket of the sheath allows you to carry anything you want, in my case it is a fire making kit, as additional data this small bag can be removed .<br />Easy to carry in several ways, either on the belt , or inside a backpack or configured according your style.<br />Its grip is firm and secure.<br />The tip of the knife reminds me of the sword in 300 which accentuates and enhances the force used in the various tasks.<br />Its length is not significant but still can be used in heavy duty which makes it a good survival knife.<br />No doubt this knife became my favorite because I can rely on the performance it gives me in any situation.<br />I highly recommend it especially fot those lovers of bushcrafting.
0312427565|5.0|As a young kid, I carefully followed the Mercury astronauts, and later the Gemini and Apollo astronauts.  I enjoyed this book.  Wolfe's admiration for the astronuats' ( as well as test pilot Chuck Yeager's ) courage is clear.  But this is not a whitewash, and at least some of the astronauts gave way to the temptations of stardom.  The movie is worth seeing too.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Lady and the Tramp is not full of magic, fairies, princesses or other elements that are usual in<br />Disney films. It's a simple love story and one of Disney's most down-to-earth films. The story is<br />not complex but it has a lot going for it: Two sympathetic leads, a wonderful interaction between<br />them, beautiful scenes (bella notte sequence, anyone?) and great supporting characters. Who<br />would have thought that a love story between two dogs could've been so appealling, romantic and<br />fun? Walt Disney did a pretty good job with this one and had stood the test of time very nicely.<br /><br />Lady and the Tramp has always been well regarded by the Disney Company and earlier this year, it<br />became the fifth title to be given the lavish \\"Diamond Treatment\\" and the results are spectacular.<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Disney has a high reputation when releasing its classic films on BD and Lady is not exception. The<br />lavish restoration that Disney has given to this film is simply breathtaking. Colors are rich and pop<br />out of the screen. Detail is perfect and contrast is strong. Also there is not any anomaly like<br />artifacts, banding or others. Is a completely perfect transfer through and through.<br /><br />In the audio department things are pretty good too. You have two options: a newly produced 7.1<br />DTS-HD MA and a newly restored version of the original mono audio presented in 3.0 DTS-HD MA.<br />Both tracks are outstanding and everyone should be happy with the results. No hiss, no<br />background noise, everything is crystal clear and has good directionality. A superb audio<br />presentation.<br /><br />Bonus Material<br />Lady and the Tramp comes with a nice assortment of bonus features both new and old.<br />Unfortunately is not as comprehensive as previous Diamond titles such as Beauty and the Beast or<br />Snow White but everything here is nice and informative.<br /><br />-Disc introduction by Diane Disney Miller is exactly that as Walt eldest daughter talks about the<br />movie, her father and their connection.<br />-Audio commentary: Inside Walt's story meetings is the best new feature of this set. Similar to<br />Bambi's story meetings, here you can listen a group of actors reenact all the meetings that Walt<br />and his team had for the creation of this film. You can't miss this one.<br />-Disney Second Screen is a way to enhance the viewing of Walt's story meetings with additional<br />storyboards, artwork and more.<br />-Diane Disney Miller: Remembering Dad is a touching tribute from Walt's daughter where she talks<br />about the time where Lady was been created alongside Disneyland.

B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I own several watches, most are invicta because of their unique style and great functionality.  This one became my favorite from the moment I put it on. Love the size and yet it's a comfortable weight. I use it everyday for work and play. Great price value. Thanks invicta and amazon.
B002ZG974M|2.0|My wife n i had the impression that the show will compare the developing stages of the 4 babies but it wasn't clear. We'd have preferred if they compare, for eg, the 4 babies learning to crawl/walk despite living in a different environment. There was such an attempt but it wasn't clear. Some shots seemed random while others irrelevant. For instance there was one where an adult was milking a cow with no baby in sight. Given the choice again, i wouldn't have bought it.
B007BZM30M|1.0|This song has got to be the most annoying, stupid thing to grace my ears in a long time. Normally I don't review things just to slam them, since no matter how sucky a song is a lot of work goes into each one. But this song deserves an exception. It's catchy and everything but it would benefit from better lyrics in my opinion. Or maybe it shouldn't exist at all.

0345803485|5.0|These bad reviews below must be bitter people who deep down wish they had someone like CHRISTIAN GREY. I bought this book yesterday and haven't put it down. I believe this book will improve women's sexual health and desires since it helps me think of my own sexual fantasy's and desires. If you want to get your mind off of work stress, laundry, or cleaning and taking care of the kids, this book does the trick.
B0072M9PM8|5.0|The Cult is BACK in a big way with COW.  No doubt this is their best effort since the Electric/Sonic Temple era.  The album is polished, sonically bombastic and it just plain rocks.  I have purchased everything put out by this band for the last 23 years, including the Rare demos, and this is by far the most excited I have been in a long time for a release.
B007K3JCAE|1.0|Another great movie in the Sherlock Holmes series but horrible choice for the Digital Copy. I want to use iTunes which you allowed for the first Sherlock Holmes movie.<br /><br />I will give the movie a better review if you get rid of UltraViolet.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I liked the book - I liked the story - sexy - all that good stuff.  What ruined it for me was the continual use of the word \\"clamber\\" for everything Ana did.  She clambered in and out of cars, in and out of bed, onto the sofa, on and on - there are so many other words that could be used.  Also the use of the words hitch, hitches and hitched with regard to breath.  It shows lack of imagination and a need for a Thesarus.  I did not let it put me off from buying the 2nd installment as I happen to enjoy the subject matter and remain hopeful that some new adjectives will be employed.  Anyone recall the overuse of \\"arms akimbo\\" that started back with Scruples?
0316044695|4.0|The second part of the book details Marcus' early years, his training to become a SEAL while still a teenager, and later the actual training that took place in Coronado, CA and elsewhere. The degree of difficulty of SEAL training is explained in clear detail; out of well over one hundred men, only a handful will have the stamina and mental fortitude to finish.Finally, after weeks and months of physical training, marksmanship, guidance and other tactical courses, the newly minted SEALs are pinned and ready to go. The final part of Lone Survivor deals with Operation Redwing and the betrayal of Petty Officers Marcus and his buddies Danny Dietz and Matthew Axelman and Lt. Michael Murphy. Also detailed is the story of Marcus Luttrell's survival, thanks in part to his overwhelming need to relate the last days of his group and in a larger part to the Pashtun villagers who protected him from the Taliban.An epic survive against all odds book that Insired me to be a better man.
B0081JFGQU|5.0|Beautiful! Well produced and mixed! Clean! As close to one of their concerts you can get.  With headphones on, maybe even better.  LOVE IT!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First, in interest of full disclosure let me start by saying that I write erotica. I also read erotica. I appreciate erotica, and that's why I hate this book.<br /><br />I don't hate it because it's successful. I hate it because in an age when e-readers are allowing women to finally purchase erotica - and lots of it - this is the kind of dreck that's being advanced as an representative of our genre. But it's not. Good erotica has solid characters and a believable plot that sets up the sex scenes. This book has neither, probably because it started out as Twilight fanfiction written by a middle-aged author obsessed with teen vampires (creepy) and then was tweaked with slight plot and name changes to be published as erotica. But James didn't tweak it enough, because the Twilight rip-offs are rampant, whether it's Mr. Grey saving  Anastasia from traffic before warning her to stay away from him because he's \\"too dangerous,\\"  to her waking up to find him broodily playing the piano. And Anastasia is just as simpering and one-dimensional as Twilight's Bella, too. Where Mr. Grey (Edward) is graceful and masterful, Anastasia is clumsy, awkward and unbelievably stupid. She trips over her own feet, doesn't know how to use email or a computer even though she's about to graduate college and her vocabulary consists mainly of \\"Oh crap.\\" If she's not biting her lower lip and being reminded of how that drives her new man crazy, then she's fantasizing about running her fingers through his hair.<br /><br />And Mr. Grey is just as ridiculous. He's only believable if you buy a 26-year-old man running an international corporation without a board of directors. That's quite a feat considering that he never seems to work. Talk about your mythical creatures. But hey, at least he doesn't sparkle in this book.<br /><br />And then there's the bondage.<br /><br />\\"Oh, Mr. Grey, what large paddles you have!\\"<br /><br />\\"The better to beat you with, my dear. But only after you sign this contract...\\"<br /><br />See, it's all in the fine print, and if Anastasia is ever going to get to run her finger through the tousled golden hair she's obsessed over since Page Three, she's going to have to agree to some Rules. He conveniently has a written copy waiting for her and really they're not that bad. They're pretty much what most of us girls have to follow if we want to keep a guy. She has to work out four days a week with a personal trainer, wear what he tells her to wear, do whatever he wants sexually whenever he wants and keep her lady business shaved. He tells her she can negotiate on some points and because she's no pushover she gets all tough and negotiates that workout schedule from four days down to three-and-a-half. Yeah...Let's hear it for feminism.<br /><br />But lest we think that Christian Grey is all bad, he does have a decent side and this is displayed by what he has agreed he will NOT make her do. He won't pee, poop or puke on her. He won't pierce her with needles, hook a car battery to her nether regions, perform acts involving gynecological instruments (he's a tycoon, not a doctor), choke her or bring midgets or ponies to bed.<br /><br />But everything else is game, and he makes it very clear that if she disobeys the rules he'll punish her. And if she obeys she gets the benefit of an \\"incentive package.\\" I'm pretty sure he just means another kind of package, but there's nothing wrong with giving a girl some hope.<br /><br />Anastasia is all cool with this, because Christian Grey says he's incapable of having any other kind of relationship and if that's all she can get then she'll take it. So she casually tells him \\"Sure. I'll do it. And did I mention I'm a virgin?\\"<br /><br />And he's all like \\"What????\\" He's kind of peeved because a guy with a torture chamber should NOT have to deal with a crisis of conscience, and now he has to. He ponders all the horrible things he wants to do to a girl who's only been kissed twice in her life. This moral agony lasts for about five minutes. Then he says, \\"Ah, hell. Why not.\\" Because just as his tousled hair has driven her crazy, he's been driven crazy all along by that cute way she bites her lower lip and must have her. He just must.<br /><br />And it just goes straight to hell from there, because that's what this book is. It's a literary hell. And it's the seventh level of hell if you happen to write erotica because those of us who work to combine good sex and good plots and are open about what we write must now refrain from punching people who ask, \\"Oh, you write stuff like Fifty Shades of Grey?<br /><br />And the answer is \\"No,\\" because most of us would have to be lobotomized to get even close to this kind of writing, which only appeals to slow horny teens or middle-aged women who should know better.<br /><br />So if you're tempted to read this book, do yourself a favor and scout around first because better stuff is out there. And if you must read it please don't think this represents the genre. Because what it represents is one middle-aged Twilight fan's sexualized fanfiction, and nothing more.
B0083B3KOQ|3.0|I'm sure I can find other uses for this app, but the main reason why I got it was do convert itunes movies.  Didn't work. I'm sure it's somewhere in the fine print though.
0345803485|1.0|This book should NOT be read by young adults or teenagers  It doesn't give a respectable feeling about any relationship/marriage  I am over half way through and will finish but will not read any of her other books  So to all parents whom have kids that love to read please read this first and don't let your kids get a hold of it.  Also this book has no place in any library/school  I can't believe I am even reading it at the beach  This is not a beach book unless you are into being sexually abused.
B007ZCQJOM|2.0|Amazon recommended this album because I liked both [[ASIN:B000FS9LKW Yellow House]] by Grizzly Bear and [[ASIN:B00505470O Within & Without]] by Washed Out. In truth, the latter album hasn't grown on me so well. There are still times when I appreciate and feel enlivened by its ethereal aggressiveness, but I have listened to it less and less as time passes.<br /><br />I have never heard of or listened to this group before. If you're a fan, you should read a different review. This is from the perspective of someone who tried something new based on a few good reviews and product cross-promotion.<br /><br />Many reviews talk about the \\"lushness\\" of this album, which reminds me of the rave reviews that [[ASIN:B000002LRJ My Bloody Valentine]] or [[ASIN:B004Q731RM Mercury Rev]] got back in the day. \\"Lush\\" usually means \\"huge blocks of fuzzy sound,\\" and while such things can be orchestrated well ([[ASIN:B00122OC7W Ulrich Schnauss]], for instance), it just sounds lazy here. There's not the same kind of craft or detail to the sound as there is in Grizzly Bear. Other reviews describe Bloom's songs as being \\"dreamscapes,\\" and I guess you could call them that, but things can still happen in dreams. Each of these songs, however, takes one musical idea and just cranks it around in a circle. The songs, about gentle, ephemeral, vague topics, don't have much to say, and they say them in inoffensive, angelic tones that never flirt with any interesting varieties.<br /><br />Some might like this, but to me it sounds mostly like treading water. \\"Troublemaker\\" was the only song that seemed to have an interesting progression or tonality. The rest is vaguely repetitive and not particularly unique. It's well done, I suppose, if not a little overwrought, but just too dull to hold my interests. If you want the musical equivalent of waves lapping the beach in the background, an unobtrusive mural of soft noise, then I would recommend this album. If you want music that provides waves you can surf, you should look elsewhere.you should look elsewhere.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Disclaimer: if you just want a steamy beach read, dive in.  If you're looking for a story that's both well written and wholly believable, skip this series.<br /><br />I got past the fact that this was written from the viewpoint of an young American woman that speaks and thinks much like a middle-aged Brit.  I was able to overcome the character development that resembles cheaply written 19th century literary figures instead of modern-day twenty-somethings.  I enjoyed the story.  In fact, I thought it was a page turner.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of traditional romance novels; I'm an action/western/crime/thriller type of gal, and this story had enough intrigue to keep my attention.  It didn't require a lot of thought, and because it's not incredibly well written, it was a quick read.<br /><br />For the record, I'm already into book three...
0345803493|3.0|Disclaimer: if you just want a steamy beach read, dive in.  If you're looking for a story that's both well written and wholly believable, skip this series.<br /><br />It's repetitive; the language is stale and the sex isn't steamy.  But I couldn't stop turning the pages.  I'd charged through the first book and had the third waiting on the coffee table, so I sloughed through \\"Darker.\\"  I'm not disappointed.  The story was still frustrating at times due to the quality of writing, but it's worth a read if you're willing to give E.L. James a little credit (hey, she's not a writer by trade or training).<br /><br />If nothing else, this book is a great conversation starter!  People always have lots of questions about it when they see it in my hands.

B0072M9PM8|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Fulton, MS<br /><br />I was so excited to hear The Cult had another album in the works. I was even more ecstatic to hear it was going to break on my birthday, May 22.<br />The CD, Choice of Weapon, is their first since their critically acclaimed Born Into This (2007).<br />It's clearly a rockin' sound with lyrics about materialism and anti-social adults pointed at Cult fans.<br />\\"We went deeper ... we worked a bit harder on this record. We have great fans and they deserve our best,\\" said Billy Duffy, lead guitarist (1983-1995, 1999-present). \\"and I feel this is one of our best records, maybe the best.\\"<br />Other members include Ian Astbury - lead vocals, percussion (1983-1995, 1999-present), Chris Wyse - bass (2006-present) and John Tempesta - drums (2006-present).<br />The British rock band formed in 1983. They first hit it in their native land with \\"She Sells Sancturay\\" and then later in the United States with \\"Love Removal Machine.\\"<br />My favorite Cult record was their fourth Sonic Temple, but I'm like Billy -- just maybe Choice of Weapon is a close second.<br />I was especially drawn to \\"Life > Death,\\"'\\"Lucifer,\\" and one of the bonus tracks \\"Embers.\\"<br />For more go to [...]
B007J4T2G8|1.0|One of the most poorly written books I've ever endured. Boring and uninspired, couldn't develop any infinity towards either character. Struggled through the entire book because as a rule I always finish what I start but it took all I had to complete it. The sex appeal and so called sexual tension was so manufactured. Don't understand why its such a \\"must read\\" guess that fact speaks volumes regarding the \\"intelligence\\" of our society.
B006CHML4I|2.0|This is a nice watch at first glance.  Price was only $70 marked down from $185 list price.<br />However, if the watch is not worn, it stops runnning after less than half a day.  If you like wearing the watch all day and take it off at night before going to bed, it likely will have to be reset when you put it back on in the morning.  I still like the watch though, and I can work around this problem.

0307474259|5.0|I'm only 29 years old, but I have struggled with high weight since the age of 10. I have gone through many diets from starvation diets, low fat diets, high protein diets, liquid diets, meal replacement diets etc... and all have had varying levels of success. This book is not a diet book, lets get that out of the way first. This book works to explain the experiences that I have had throughout most of my life. The hunger of low calorie diets, the energy of high carbohydrate diets, why the laws of thermodynamics as applied to weight loss never seemed to describe me for reasons I couldn't explain. Gary Taubes not only answers many of my questions with amazing clarity through historical studies, but angers me towards historical scientists and dietitians that ignored overwhelming evidence contrary to their personal beliefs. Essentially the pride of these scientists to prove their hypothesis instead of considering the fact that they might be wrong has indirectly caused much physical and mental problems for myself. I don't blame much of the science which was just unknown, but so much was willfully thrown out to support their hypothesis. I can't put into words how much of what this book elucidates towards my personal experiences. I have recommended all my friends who will listen to read this book, and I suggest anyone who is interested in why most attempts to lose weight just don't seem to work should give this book a read, if for nothing else than the history lesson on why governments and medical bodies recommend the diets they do.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|One of my favorite puzzle games, quite beautifully done. Only negative is that there is no swipe-to-fill for consecutive cells. If this feature could be added it would make solving and error correction much faster.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I used to play Picross on the DS quite a bit, so this is a welcome addition to my app library.  It's similar to sudoku where you have to logically figure out how to fill in the blocks based on the clues given, but in the end you create a picture.  The presentation of this game is excellent.  Very nice graphics, very smooth animations.  My one gripe is how you control the puzzle.  Each box requires a click to fill it in, or a double click to set it with an x.  I would prefer a simple swipe across the screen to fill in the boxes, much like the DS works.  They could just put a few buttons on screen to switch actions: fill-in, x, or erase.  It's annoying to have to tap 15 boxes in a row.  Still easily worth the free download, but not really a worth $5 compared to other games out there.<br /><br />EDIT: It looks like you can fill with a swipe if you press and hold first.  Thanks to another reviewer who pointed this out.
0440242401|4.0|This book was pure pleasure. Sophie Kinsella's breezy style quickly moves the reader through your worst nightmare: waking up with amnesia after a car accident.<br /><br />Except in this case, Lexi Smart, a snuggled-toothed young woman struggling with her looks, her job, and her love life has suddenly become a better version of herself. No longer snaggletoothed, she wakes up as the slim, perfect wife of a rich, handsome, real estate developer who seems devoted to her. No longer a mere employee at her job at a carpet company, she has also become a cold, ambitious director known as \\"the cobra\\" at work.<br /><br />After her initial euphoria, Lexi becomes disillusioned with her perfect life. Okay, she's slim and elegant but she misses eating chips. And her husband is a passionless controlling machine who doesn't know her or care to. When a love triangle develops between her and her husband's architect, Jon, who claims he and Lexi were in love before her accident, we root for Lexi to dump her perfect husband, her perfect loft, and her barracuda persona and return to being a lovable if imperfect human being. Most of all, we hope she realizes that  Jon really is the man she loves.<br /><br />Without disclosing the end, this book is a joy to read if a bit predictable.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's been a day and it still hurts when trying to breathe around the thoughts consumed by this book. How can fictional characters have such a huge life? How can their trials and suffering become part of us? Oh Hazel Grace! Oh Augustus Waters! Oh Isaac! Such a universe of LOVE! Such epic grandeur in wishes and dreams. Were it possible that we could all be as brave and selfless as these marvelous heroes. John Green you are undoubtedly a worldwide treasure and your talent knows no bounds. My heart is steeped in both sorrow and joy and for this I thank you.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|excellent product (highly recommended) despite the departure of the 3rd generation of this processor, is still up to their competitors, intel knows his stuff
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I only rented this video because I am a Liam Neeson fan. But this film would be totally lacking in dialogue if not for the F word.
B002C39TUA|5.0|The first Smiths album I've owned, and needless to say, I will be getting their queen is dead album. The sound is very talented and tight. Reading along the lyrics as the album played made me realize how much of a genius the songwriters were in this album. Thankfully there's plenty of variety if you want something to jam to, relax, and everything in between. \\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" had me laughing my *** off first time I was listening to the lyrics. Overall, I certainly recommend giving this album a shot for first time Smith listeners. There's always youtube to check out the songs, but to REALLY enjoy it, get it on Vinyl. It's a heavyweight 180 gram and it sounds terrific.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Loved it. I read it on Kindle and could almost hear Tina Fey speaking the text as I read it. I love her humor and this was great fun.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really enjoy this game so far. If you're a sudoku fan, like myself, you'll thoroughly enjoy this game :) need more faotd like this!! But this one should last a while.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This would be worth 4.0000000000001 stars compared to 4.0000000.... stars for the first. The title is more insteresting and better, but the Capitol should be burned horribly. The part I loved was the wonderful cover!
B0073U2F2Q|5.0|In terms of the \\"product\\", I can only say this: The items arrived on time, the quality is excellent, and I received all disks. As far as the movie goes, no Academy Awards anticipated here, but the special effects are great, and the movie is certainly entertaining.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This sample is the only thing I took and it was good. But I did not take the book because I knew that this book would NOT be so good.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|This heat transfer thermal compound allows the heat sink to keep the CPU cool. The polysynthetic silver themal compount is a must for all computers buolders.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've played games similar to this before and they are addicting!  I went through a handful of puzzles so far and the game is super smooth, fun to play and worth every penny.  It's chock full of content from what I gathered wandering around the menus.
B0077ATSU4|5.0|Interesting movie.  Was told ahead of time it disturbed some viewers due to 9/11 incident.  I can understand that as<br />the image of a man falling from the window played several times during the movie started to be bothersome for<br />me so I can imagine how someone who lost someone at 9/11 would feel seeing that over and over.  I think Sandra<br />Bullock was excellent in the movie.  Some parts were a little difficult to follow but the acting by all was<br />extremely good.
014241493X|2.0|I liked Looking for Alaska so I decided to read this book. Well, I was bored while reading. Same story with a different place and characters. Everyone is so unbelievable (especially Margo, Q's parents) and every event (fish, a girl spending nights in a long-abandoned filthy warehouse, etc.) is so unrealistic. I really wanted to quit reading.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|There are not enough words to describe how much I loved this book, and these characters.<br /><br />I was hooked from page one, and couldn't put it down until I was finished.<br /><br />I've read a few books by Sylvia Day in the past, but I always seem to forget how much I enjoy her work.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that book two (Deeper in You) isn't out yet. I can't wait to see what happens to Gideon and Eva.<br /><br />All in all, this was a fantastic read!
0345803507|5.0|I finished the trilogy in a week, which is a personal best for me since I do not usually read for fun.  Some of the conversations were repetitive and could have saved about 20 pages, but overall, I loved the books!  I fell in love with Christian Grey as did my girlfriends.  It is also safe to say, I may have become borderline obsessed. The pages turned effortlessly and I am on my second sitting of the book.  I hope the rumor of a 4th book and movie are true.  I've blabbed enough.<br />Happy Reading!
0345803507|1.0|the first book i read and enjoyed well enough. However by the second i was merely scanning it as it was so repetitive, by the this book i did something i have never ever done skipped to the last few chapters just to find out what his issue was.<br /><br />This was just a repeat of the first two books. Really all three books could have been written as one. Boring
B006VFLIYK|5.0|One of the best books yet from David Baldacci.  He had me at the first page and I could not put the book down.  Have recommended this to several people as a great summer read!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|it wont let me sign into my facebook account :( please fix! I got a facebook just to play this game
B00005JKLZ|5.0|This is a new turn on an old classic and it's done quite well, as our character goes from the Victorian Era to the Men and creatures at the end of time, and yes that mannequin in the window across from his house goes through all of the changing styles
B0072NWJRK|5.0|Well written account of a murder in a time of chaos in China.  Good descriptions of China pre World War II, especially the foreigners living in Pekin at that time. It hold one's interest without being gory.
B0058VW36U|1.0|I can't let my children play this now since the developer decided to put in-app purchasing.  This also means I no longer get the entire game I paid for.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Excellent account of the \\"slave prison\\" camps in North Korea.  Incredible life on a man born in the camp, the conditions he lived under, the inhuman treatment of the prisoners and finally his remarkablle escape and life afterwards.  This should enlighten those of the outside world that such conditions do actually exist.
B00634GHJA|1.0|There is advertising in this expensive paid app.<br /><br />Also, there are many highly suspicious 5-star reviews that seem to be very close in content, clustering once our twice per week on the same day.<br /><br />I  don't trusr the dev now.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|An epic film that should go down in history. I was blown away. The drama on the ground and the thrilling aerial combat scenes are outstanding. I liked the story a lot. The story of these airmen had to be told and with today's special effects it gives us a greater appreciation of how it may have been in the cockpit.
B004QOB8SO|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS<br /><br />When Season One of Sherlock ended we found Sherlock  (Benedict Cumbebatch) and Dr. John Watson (Martin Freeman) at a seemingly impossible impasse.<br />John is hostage, wearing an explosive vest. Our villain Moriarty is grabbed by John, as if he'd take on his bluff. Then a sniper zeroes in on Sherlock and John backs off. Both are in the sights of numerous snipers and the season ends.<br />Season two goes back to that moment but ever so briefly before we're sent into three prominent titles Holmes buffs are sure to recognize -- A Scandal in Bohemia, The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Final Problem.<br />\\"There's the question of how to go out on a cliffhanger and then the thematic things of the three stories, where we were trying to get to and what Sherlock and John's relationship is a little further on,\\" Mark Gatiss (who plays Sherlock's weird brother Mycroft Holmes) said. \\"You can't just go back to: 'You have no emotions.' 'I don't care.' You've got to move on somewhere and make sure the other characters have something of a journey too.\\"<br />Sherlock, still a loner, and frustrated with his fellow man in general is evolving. In this second series he acknowledges John as a friend, shows some interest in the opposite sex and even says \\"I'm sorry.\\"<br />I really like Sherlock and how BBC has taken these old cases and reinvented them for the times we live in. My only complaint would be the rather annoying subtitles which show what Sherlock is thinking instead of letting him sigh and explain, in his own way, what everyone should already know.<br />It has been rumored that Cumberbatch will play a lead role in the upcoming J. J. Abrams-directed Star Trek sequel.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was a bit nervous to read after hearing one of my gal friends describe this as \\"Mommy porn.\\" To our bookclub, but I am so glad I did! This book was about love and truly accepting ourselves and others and I really enjoyed it. (And fell in love a little, I must admit!)  As soon as I finished book one I immediately downloaded the other two. I would ( and Have) recommend this book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So much hype about this book, so I had to read it.  I have no idea  what excited anybody.  The writing is weak.  Holy cow.  The plot is derivative.  The first 100 pages were absolutely worthless.  The sex isn't sexy.  Don't buy this.  Buy A Man and a Maid.  Buy 9 and 1/2 weeks.  Buy Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty books.
1451627289|3.0|This is not King's best book, although there is a good book in there. Sometimes he gets right on track and rolls along in that relentless way you expect of this author, and sometimes he wanders off onto a side road and goes round and round for a while without getting anywhere. It seems that publishers don't bother editing books anymore and it shows, even (and sometimes especially) when the authors are famous, talented, or both. This book needed to be pruned a good bit, and it didn't happen. But Mr. King is both famous and talented, and the talent comes through even in his lesser works. His place in the literary history of our time is assured, regardless of whether this present offering is his best or not.<br /><br />What surprises me (and I've seen this attitude directed at other authors as well) is how venomous readers are (especially fans) when the latest offering doesn't please them. Any author will be judged by the body of their work, and it's distressing to see people who have obviously been entertained, enlightened and moved by an author's work, turn on them with such bitter anger - as if, having once failed to please, they should creep away in shame and never be heard from again. Sharper than a serpent's tooth indeed.
B007N0REX6|5.0|I've been a huge Slash fan for as long as I can remember. He's the reason I started playing guitar, got a Les Paul, and joined a band. Appetite is one of my favorite rock albums of all time. The Use Your Illusions albums were not quite as straight out rock n roll, thanks to Axl and his penchant for overproduction and orchestral background music. Then Slash ventured off into Snakepit and Velvet Revolver, which both put out some good albums, but nothing like this.<br /><br />Slash was and always will be a meat and potatoes rock n roller. His debut solo album, though very strong, just wasn't very cohesive. It was hard having so many singers and so many different types of songs on the same album. Through that process, thankfully, Slash met Myles Kennedy, and the rest is history.<br /><br />This album, start to finish, is pure rock and roll. Every song hits you hard with upbeat tempos, biting guitar riffs, and screaming Slash solos. He flat out sounds better on this album than he has since the GNR days. His signature sound is there, but with Myles out in front, the pair put together some outstanding rock music. Couple them with Brent Fitz on drums and Todd Kernz on bass (his touring band the last few years), and this is one cohesive, hard rocking album!<br /><br />The difference between this album and his last are night and day. You can hear how tight this band is, as they've played so much together over the last few years. The songs sound great, but not overproduced like so many rock albums these days (e.g. Daughtry). The drums sound like real drums and not coming from a computer, the guitar riffs sound raw, and the vocals are tight but not overdone.<br /><br />I could go through what makes each song great here, but you'll hear for yourself. I got this album the day it was released, and haven't stopped listening to it since then. My favorite song is probably \\"Anastasia\\", which starts off with some great acoustic work followed up by one of the best guitar riffs Slash has written since Sweet Child O Mine. His solo work in that song is brilliant, as is everything else he's done here.<br /><br />This is Slash at his finest since his GNR days. Do NOT hesitate to buy this album!written since Sweet Child O Mine. His solo work in that song is brilliant, as is everything else he's done here.<br /><br />This is Slash at his finest since his GNR days. Do NOT hesitate to buy this album!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Over all a good game. There are no hints however if you get stuck. Seems to progress in difficulty pretty fast.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|the ending could have been better.  the're were a few really good thrilling moments; then is just kinda ended, quickly.  Left alot of questions open, but not i a squeal type way.  worth watching once.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|what a fun way to decorate your own place.  I love decorating different things with different styles. Just the fact that you have to buy your bills. So I only have 4 bucks.
1582406723|5.0|My son really enjoyed these books. I heard about them for weeks. And he's now even trading with friends:) anything to keep your children reading and making them happy

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I must say that this is the easiest to use Bible I have ever used! I still like paper Bibles, but I like this app because of its offline Bibles, interactive note community, and footnotes (love the footnotes! whenever I see one I always click it! XD). I am a theological student, and this has answered several if my questions. It has helped me a lot in life and in school. God with you. Wherever you tread! &infin;

B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I watched this movie under the impression that it was a comedy and on reflection it probably is a comedy - if you find that kind of thing funny.<br /><br />To be fair, there were times when I laughed - like when Clooney runs to his friend's house in flip flops or when the appalling kid gets a punch in the eye and I get that when people said awkward, painful things it was supposed to be humorous in a black way. But somehow it just missed the mark.
0307165485|5.0|Wow, it is fantastic to revisit this book after so long. I used to watch this book every night before bed and it was in bad shape as it had been passed down from my brother and sister to me. I still enjoyed it even though it was beyond repair.<br /><br />I was just browsing around and sound it here, what a pleasant surprise! I could finally see the last beginning and ending pages. But most of all, now I can read it with my ouw children.<br /><br />This book has a vast amount of stories, rhymes and just good-ol learning. You will not be dissappointed.
B007R41E8O|1.0|It downloaded and worked great on my kindle fire so it gets one star for that.  It was hard to find the logic or rythum to the game so was forced to rely on the hints way too often.  No map to help navigate back and forth through the scenes, useless clues, collected objects which were never used, and it was the absolute worst ending ever!  Buy at your own risk!
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|\\"THE BODYGUARD\\" is one of my All-Time Favorites! I think I've watched it about 15 times. Kevin Costner plays the role of the Bodyguard with perfection. Whitney Houston's Music is Incredible to say the least, and her acting in this movie is one of her Best Performances. She was always a Big Fan of mine as soon as she was recognized for her unforgettable music. I remember how young she was when I first heard her sing, I was Amazed at her voice, and said \\"She's Going Places-Big-time!\\" Sure enough, she climbed to fame in no time. After her  passing, I watched this movie once again, listening to that Beautiful Voice. Whitney Houston sadly left this world, but her music will live on forever, including her song at the end of this movie. \\"I Will Always Love You.\\" And the world will always love the music she left behind. Together, Kevin and Whitney made this movie highly entertaining, enjoyable, and thrilling. The characters helped to make the movie alive, along with the young boy who played her son. What was there not to like? There was plenty of action from beginning to end, never a dull moment and the only thing I was sorry about is that I didn't want it to end. All-In-All, Outstanding in every aspect!

B007IX00ZC|5.0|This album, Pandora's Pinata, is an excellent album to pick up if you are new to Diablo Swing Orchestra (DSO). It has a little of everything on it, from Celtic inspired strings, pop stylings, to sitar leading melodies to the hard driving heavy metal mixed with swing style tropes. There is no easy way to describe the  style of music, and not every song is for every person. However, in the words of DSO themselves, \\"One of the most common comment we get is: I showed you to my mom/granny/aunt/grandpa and they actually liked it. So it turns out we make music for the elderly\\". While the majority of the music they make probably isn't included in this statement, it is quite possible that certain songs very much cross generations. I just don't always suggest grandma listen to in depth to some of the (clean and yet dark in theme) lyrics.<br /><br />This album, of the three, is the most polished. The (not-so) secret surprise of the band is the trained operatic voice of female lead, Annlouice Loegdlund, who in past albums has had a piercing tone to her voice. In this album, she is near perfect, which is not only kudos to her, but the mix team that mastered this work. Sadly, the genius and insanity of former drummer, Andreas Halvardsson, is not evident on this album. The drummer who has stepped up is more than adequate and is in fact quite good, but Mr. Halvardsson had a demonic energy and an ability to choose just the right sound to balance the insanity made by his bandmates.  And, oh, the bandmates! Using lush strings, brassy trumpets, trombones, a bass line that is incredible and understated in this album, heavy metal guitars, keyboards, a demented song smith... Oh, and every voice is used as an instrument.<br /><br />Let's talk about Pandora's Pinata.<br /><br />There are 11 songs on this album, and each have the signature touch of DSO on them, despite the fact that many sound like they come from separate bands entirely. Everyone thinks they can describe DSO easily, but whenthey actually try... it's harder to do than you think!<br /><br />1. Voodoo Mon Amour - what a great way to be introduced to DSO. This is a song that will cross generational gaps, and could easily be heard at a Lindy Hop...<br />2. Guerilla Laments - Want to Zumba with DSO? Here you go. Some of the manic energy that should clue you in to the world of DSO. It might be easy to miss all the insanity going on in the background, but listen to it. Ms. Loegdlund has never sounded better.<br />3. Kevlar Sweethearts - This has a feeling to a video game beginning, almost a shout out to the battlefield series. The outro is amazing and a testament to the ability of their song writing.<br />4. How to Organize a Lynch Mob - Lush. Amazing. And in true form to DSO by putting an almost non sequitar on their album, like past albums. It also shows their commitment to saying, \\"We can do that. And not only can we do it, but we do it well. And it makes sense!\\" Unlike past albums, songs on this album share melodic themes in a more obvious way. It also leads up nicely to...<br />5. Black Box Messiah - This song is a fantastic treat. It is also an amazing departure from classic \\"DSO\\", whatever that may be thought of. Using Japanese and a blaring horn section like a 60s superhero show, I could see this as the start of a TV show... which may be what the whole idea is. High energy and fun!<br />6.Exit Strategy of a Wrecking Ball - This song is the most like the \\"harder DSO\\" from past albums and has the most markers that say, \\"This is Diablo Swing Orchestra!\\" despite all of their music being totally their own. The lyrics are the most telling of what the band is about, with the repeated \\"You will never see her again,\\" taunting the male lead in his failure to turn his lady's eye... and the anger he holds towards her.<br />7. Aurora - Ms. Loegdlund is on display here, and the song could easily be heard on the stages of Broadway. The albums themes are on display here, and yet, very little in the way of metal. This is, oddly, almost one of my favorites, and if it had been fully orchestrated it would be amazing, instead of relying on what seems to be keyboard instruments in spots.<br />8. Mass Rapture - There's anger here, and it is channeled wonderfully. The message is interesting, less anti-spirituality and more anger versus opiate of the masses. Musically it is evocative of multiple religions, with chanting, sitars, throat singing, a call to prayer-esque soprano... and the frenetic energy that makes you want to move, and jump in and stop thinking.<br />9. Honey Trap Aftermath - This has radio play all over it. It is also a new style for DSO to master, a \\"pop\\" style song (I could have heard htis in the 90s!). The bassist is on display here... and is amazing.<br />10. Of Kali Ma Calibre - This is a song that has brilliant moments, but in my opinion is not the strongest in this album. It should be, starting with the chilling refrains of the \\"Psycho\\" string pulls from the shower string. It moves into a very fanfare-like march that jarringly turns into speed metal in parts, and that doesn't work for me, sadly. I suppose the song matches the Kali Ma theme. However, there are parts that are brilliant and worth waiting for the sections that don't seem to work. Mr. Halvardsson is sorely missed on this track.<br />11. Justice for Saint Mary - Wrapping up all the themes in one song, both lyrical and musical in a long and interesting track, this diverges from a lot of the heavy metal, but it builds. And the ending shows fans that DSO is moving and fusing and exploring and is probably one of the freshest group of musicians taking tropes and merging them, mostly, into an amazing experience. And Dubstep.<br /><br />Overall, this is an album that has replay ability. Of all the albums, I believe Pandora's Pinata is the most accessible to the public, showing the world what they can do with musical ideas that many have considered shallow in the realm of ideas.  While the lyrics are dark, and full of angst, there is a sliver of hope in what DSO does. Every \\"character\\" or \\"voice\\" in their songs are flawed and the things that happen to them are easily seen as their own fault. Temptation exists in the musical world of DSO, and it is mighty easy to be tempted, but the music shows an exit from the darkness... or perhaps a celebration of that darkness. It is up to the listener to decide if the messages being shared are indictments or celebrations.<br /><br />Ignore the lyrics, and the themes and you have a cracking good section of music. Pandora's Pinata isn't as musically dark, but it is amazingly put together. You will hear familiar tropes, no matter the type of music you listen to. And if heavy metal swing with a touch of opera and the exploration of musical ideas isn't your thing, well, then, this album isn't for you. I find it exciting, what they are doing.
B007C3TVNA|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies of 2012. We decided to watch it because it got high ratings on Amazon and Rotten Tomatoes. However, the entire movie is grossly cliché, with a terrible screenplay, and poorly acted and directed. Tilda Swinton, who is a very talented actress, gives as good as a performance as she can give, considering the poor script and horrible direction. The movie attempts to create psychologically thrilling scenes, but what it really amounts to is pulling some ideas from a psychology case study and piecing them together to make a movie. For instance, Kevin is not a very believable character. He does things and the viewer is left with no idea why other than some text book snippets thrown into the movie at random. The whole movie is disjointed (we couldn't even understand most of what was happening until at least 40 minutes in) in the director's lame attempt to be \\"artistic.\\" Not worth the time... certainly not worth buying.
B005GUQIDC|3.0|I am not sure she should be compared with anyone except the dozens of pop artist that use elements of R&B, Jazz, and Pop vocals to sound \\"fresh\\".  She sounds over produced.  Sure her lyrics are slightly different but nothing revolutionary.  Perhaps if I saw her live I would have a different opinion.  So far, she is just another vanilla pop artist.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I was able to review this during a Pre-Screening [...]& the girls that were able to watch it with me went wild! This is a great DVD & it's refreshing to see a band that focuses on singing their music rather than focusing on trying to do the latest dance moves. This DVD is a must have for any 1D fans - you won't be disappointed. It definitely got us hyped for the concert that we're going to next month! Loved it! :)

B007JM4CWY|5.0|I am completely hooked on this puzzle game. Super smooth on my tablet. A must try for anyone who likes thinking games!
B0081J95TE|5.0|7 years in the making, but worth it I think. Many very solid songs, no real misses. I think \\"The Battle In Me\\" is possibly my favorite, and although I didn't initially like \\"Blood for Poppies\\" it really grew on me. \\"Control\\" has a great opening and a nice hook and would be my utter favorite but I think they fall down a little on the overprocessed third chorus. I'd recommend it highly to any Garbage fan.
0307474275|1.0|Wow. I admit I actually enjoyed the story itself -- likable characters, lots of action, twists and turns.<br /><br />However, in retrospect, I did start to tire of all the plot twists. It's like Brown just wanted to keep shaking things up as if that was his entire goal of writing. It seems I see that more and more today -- that a book can't be suspenseful and linear, but has to just keep surprising us. Gives me whiplash, but it was a fun read.<br /><br />Bigger issue: the complete lack of historical accuracy for the underlying premises of the book was mind-numbing. I realize many readers would not even see this, but it's still disturbing, and for me it spoiled the book. It's really just an education tool promoting a modern twist on ancient Gnosticism and other trendy (in some circles) ideas packaged inside of a suspense novel. I say one star.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|a lot of fun. just like alchemy. I'd wait until it is on sale for $0.99 or free though. $2.99 is a little much.
0312944926|2.0|For a while I was enjoying the story, suspending my disbelief over various things. But more and more it just began wearing me down.  WARNING -- PLOT SPOILERS...<br /><br />What specifically? The writing style (overuse of similes, too long on background descriptions and asides -- often I just skimmed over paragraphs to get to the next action segment), the characters that were flat, cliched, and predictable, the repeated use of the SAME basic plot as his other books, and so forth. And some reviewers here have explained the technical errors (with both computers and cryptography) -- that's not my department, but even I wondered at times. Even I knew that they should look at the periodic table of the elements!<br /><br />And the head of the NSA computer systems spending his weekends soldering wires inside of a main frame? Really??? And having so many NSA employees who had unscrupulous backgrounds as well as very unprofessional, sit-com type behaviors. And the NSA executive authorizing an assassin, and on top of that it's a solo assassin who is so careless and sloppy -- and sometimes deaf and sometimes not deaf. And then an entire building on the NSA campus is burning up while the NSA director and some of his staff argue about whether anything is going wrong -- oh, we can't reach the assistant director on his phone, so we'll just stand here and have a cliched argument and take no action before the story comes back to us. Really?<br /><br />And I can't find the specific reference, but there's a real boo-boo about a gun somewhere earlier in the book. I mean, the author seems to know almost nothing about them, making up a term for a gun part that does not exist. Wish I could find it...<br /><br />I hate giving such a list of negatives about anyone's work, but I had to make a rare exception here. Just very disappointing in so many ways. I'd say only read it if you can overlook all this stuff and just want a story to pass the time. (I'll admit, I do that myself sometimes -- soI reluctantly say two stars here).
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Entertaining app, sometimes it does get stuck but other than that fun.  It kept me occupied while on a flight when I got bored with reading.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Game is definitely a good way to exercise your brain and kill some time, but it gets a bit tedious. I wish I didn't have to fill in long rows of squares or X's, and it can be tricky to mark the correct box sometimes. Knocking off a star for that.<br /><br />Also, if you're paying full price for this app, you might feel like $5 a very good value for a simple puzzle game. I know, I know, it works out to probably $0.02/puzzle, but considering you could buy Cut the Rope, Where's my Water, Fruit Ninja, and Plants vs. Zombies combined for the price of just this one puzzle game... Well, all I'm saying is you're going to get a lot more entertainment value buying those 4 games than you will get buying this one game.
B007JM4CWY|2.0|The concept is very interesting. But the design is poor. There doesn 't seem to be any way to open the app on the Kindle Fire once you've closed it or removed it from the carousel. Developer (&amp; others) please note this serious glitch.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|ok at first I didn't know If I was going to like. this game or not but after I figured it out its.... AMAZING..!!  I love it there's so many thing to choose from and express yourself. there is new stuff to get all the time and well I cant tell how just amazing it is ill have to get ot to find out ...  ;D !!!!!!!!
1439156816|3.0|Stephen King can write, no question about that.  This is two books.  The first one is a recounting of his early childhood and young adult stuggles. Interesting if that's what you bought the book to learn.  The second book is on wrtiting.  I bought the book for this subject - how to write well.  It's very good.  Lots of Stephen's opinion some may not agree with, but he is a very successful writer and it is worth learning what he thinks about the subject.  Mostly he is right on.  I underlined much of the second half of the book, not the first half.  A table of contents would have seaved me hours of wondering when I would get to the good part.  The book is worth buying and reading - the second half.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Storm Corrosion is an album that if anyone has an interest in listening to it should run out and buy. Don't read the reviews about what it is or isn't. If you have no vested interest in either artists past works then you know what to do. For me, I have been a huge fan of Steven Wilson and Porcupine Tree and a passing fan of Opeth so naturally I was intrigued. And it was that feeling of having a balance of what Wilson would create along with a sense of uncertainity of the finished product that pushed me to invest. In a magazine article with Wilson and Akerfeldt when asked about the music they replied, \\"expect the unexpected.\\" An over-used cliche but none more apropros. (And here's my small opinion)... I believe this album will be liked by people in a particular headspace when they hear it. Others will dismiss it. Again, the experience is up to you.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|We should all detest Shirley Manson & the boys for keeping us waiting so damn long for another album, but you know we still love them. This album roars with a ferocity that pop music rarely ever attains.<br /> Garbage has always had more of an edge than any other pop group I can recall. This work features some their hardest sounds yet. Like my favorite bands (U2, Radiohead for excample) they've never tried repeating themselves. \\"not your kind...\\" has the sound that you love & sets Garbage apart, but it is different from their other stuff.<br /> Manson is a tough cat to characterize. She has never reminded me of any female singer I've ever heard. On this disc she sings with a fire & passion that reminds you why you have missed this band sooo much & why you practically did back flips when they suddenly announced early this year that they were back.<br /> Her \\"boys\\", Duke Erikson, Steve Marker &, of course, Butch Vig, attack every tune with an industrial, post-punk vengence that signal that they may have been mad my by their own absence. Even the slower stuff (which there isn't much of) has a sense of danger to it. They go to the outer edge of their sound without sacrificing the melodies & hooks that make them so bloody much fun to listen to. Strangly enough my least favorite song is their single, \\"Blood For Poppies\\", & I really like that song. \\"Battle In Me\\", \\"I Hate Love\\", \\"Control\\" & \\"Automatic Systematic Habit\\" absolutely kick you-know-what. These are among the best songs they've ever produced on what may be a better album than their awesome debut.<br /> It is certainly their best album in 7 years. (The 15 cut longer edition is definitely worth whatver extra $$$ you have to shell out.)
B005SLS3VY|5.0|An excellent book,A true Michael Connelly  creation. made easy flowing reading. The story its self was intriguing and  gripping I found myself not wanting to put it down.
B003EYVXVE|3.0|Don't worry!  As soon as you all mature and grow up - this movie will fade to black.<br />Really exciting movie with a real twist.  Teenagers killing each other for food.<br />Punishment by the meanie \\"NWO\\".<br /><br />An epic movie would be Gladiator, Open Range, Waterworld<br /><br />Yawn.
B0072M9PM8|5.0|Wilderness Now is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I love this cd, and Ian and Billy remain the real deal.
B003EYVXV4|4.0|I am one of the many that really enjoyed The Hunger Games series, so of course I was excited and nervous to see the movie. In short, I thought they did a very excellent job at it. The casting was spot on. I think every actor fit perfectly with the character they were playing. I really enjoyed the movie and thought it was done really well. There were quite a few things left out or condensed, but all in all I was not very disappointed.<br /><br />Now for the long of it and there will be spoilers so reader beware ;)<br />There was barely any beginning to this movie. Everything happens very fast. You are introduced to some of the important characters, but they hardly feel important as Katniss and Peeta were whisked off to the Hunger Games. I think it worked okay for the movie, but it makes Peeta the logical love intrest, so it sort of cuts down on the internal struggle Katniss has picking between them. Next Madge? Anyone? Anyone? No Madge?! Why not. I think that Madge played a subtly important role and I was quite dismayed that they blotted out her existence. So the tributes are getting ready at the Capitol and I just felt like there wasn't much between Katniss and Peeta then. I think all the emotions that happen pre-games is what made them such dynamic characters in the books. You could see that they sort of become friends and then you see Peeta slow betrayal of that trust, that makes you wonder about him. I just felt like the character interactions could have been a bit stronger for the movie. I did love Cinna and Katniss, but again their movie relationship seemed a bit shallow and abrupt. There were also no transports for the dead bodies, which seemed a bit odd to take out, but ultimately didn't ruin the movie. I wished that there was more about Foxface but again, wasn't crucial to the story so they took it out. There were tons of things I loved about this movie though, like the command central for the games. It was very interesting to see the behind the scenes of the games. As easy as thinking it and they could do it. I'll mention the cast again, because the acting was great and they fit the characters so well. Definitely check out this movie. It got me so excited for the next three movies. I'm super excited to see the arena in Catching Fire. It's going to be crazy. Watching Mockingjay will be great too, because it's such a different story from the first two. So much happens and it's all very interesting. Anyways. the movie was lovely even though they left out a lot of things. My hope is that the relationships will get stronger in the next movie and then this series will be epic, like the books.e games. As easy as thinking it and they could do it.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|After 2 decades, Megadeth released another album that is almost flawless. After their failure with \\"Risk\\" and breaking up after \\"The World Needs a Hero\\", Dave Mustaine managed to push on and create the ideal Megadeth album for this decade. The music is written amazingly well and performed with extreme precision and extreme force. Basically, the band has never sounded better. Dave's voice sounds great on the songs.<br /><br />This album essentially combines the thrash metal of \\"Peace Sells\\", the epicness of \\"Rust in Peace\\", and the melody of \\"Youthanasia\\". The album opens with a blistering thrash metal instrumental and closes with a powerful metal anthem. The only song on this record that was off a little was \\"The Hardest Part of Letting Go/Sealed With A Kiss\\". Otherwise, I can't really find anything wrong with this album.<br /><br />Bottom-line: I think this is the best Megadeth record over-all since \\"Rust in Peace\\", their classic. It isn't better than \\"Rust in Peace\\" but it definitely is right behind it.<br /><br />If you're a Megadeth fan, get this and be prepared to be blown away.<br />If you're new to the band, buy \\"Rust in Peace\\" first.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|So nice to have so many Bible translations at my finger tips. I have used some of the plans too and enjoyed studying different topics.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the first of Wool a few months ago. I really liked it and loved the concept. The book kept me thinking a few days after i finished it. I wished there was more to it then this short story. then I noticed there was 5 Story ! I didn't think twice, Bought all of them and started reading. I barely put it down while working. This book was well worth the price and I am still hoping there will be more!<br /><br />Yes, there is some flaw like other's pointed out, but I didn't care because the story line and character's  development is so well written then it didn't take away the enjoyment I felt reading it. I discarded those minor things easily for pure delight! Book don't need to be \\"perfect\\" to be Awesome, even Harry Potter had some flaw and see where it is now :)<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this book as much as i did!
0345803507|1.0|If the young girl and the book are in your home at the same time, even on your electronic device, the answer will be YES.  Haven't read the book myself because porn is addicive and this is porn for women.  Do you want your daughter or your niece or your babysitter addicted to anything at all because of you?  If not, I'd advice to get rid of the book.  You read it, fine, you're an adult.  But please think of the young minds around you.
B007L96SI6|4.0|I didn't care for Haley on AI when I'd catch her performances due to her growling and inability to pick songs that suited her voice. It was hard to tell if she was worthwhile when she didn't sound good to me. I kept thinking she should be singing jazz. Jazz, girl, jazz! So here is her debut CD. I've been enjoying her song on the radio so I thought I'd see what the fuss was all about. Knocked it out of the park! Most every song is good, really good or wow and haha, no rock, just pop or pop/jazz type melodies.<br /><br />Best song - Hit the Ground Runnin'<br />No - Liar, that's the best song<br />Wait - Undone, she has nice connection to the melody and lyrics<br />Hold on - Keep Coming Back, that's the best
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great transaction. Item was exactly as described! Arrived quickly! Thanks so much! Would definitely recommend this seller for all future purchases.
B007R3AZNK|3.0|well here is another Joe Bonaassa cd & more of the same measured songs & same riffs as all the other cd's, he has yet to get that edge back he showed on Blues Deluxe , he just writes tunes or does covers that will fill out yet another cd & yes it sells because his name is on it,,, He is turning into another Clapton, just phone it in & it sells no raw singing or soloing other the the usual riffs & only enough to get the sales made. Sorry Joe I thought after Dust Bowl you'd actually seen the light but you're clueless , why not get back to a trio & do what you do best just play what feels good rather than what seems like you should do to keep yourself in fast cars & women, for those fan boys who just fall all over Joe why not listen to Blues Deluxe & see if this measures up...you'll see it doesn't...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|i've not been too sexual and loved the<br /><br /> book because of that. made me want to experiment. nothing wrong with enjoying yours and his body.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Love the harder direction the band has taken! Lzzy is a total rock goddess!! I can't quit listening to it!
B007L96SI6|5.0|Very good 1st cd.I would like to see her with a 1st class producer.Awesome with what she can do with her voice.Nice one Haley.keep it up.
0345803485|2.0|I could NOT get through the first hundred pages. It is sitting in the bathroom next to the commode with all my other reading materials. Maybe I can use it for toilet paper. How in the world did it attract someone's attention enough to get published? WHY is it successful? WHO is her agent? Geez.
0345803485|5.0|What a steamy, sensual, erotic, sexy thriller of a sort!  All I can say is WOW!  I started one morning on chapter 8 and couldn't put the book down into late that afternoon on chapter 21!
B007YOC4RW|5.0|What an album. Joe has stepped back to his roots some and got a few old songs that sound fresh and some great new material. The sleeper on the album is \\"Too much Ain't enough love\\". Great album buy it.
B005KP7EK4|1.0|Aaaand it isssss the slowwww drying kind. My three dollars paid for this fair warning. You're welcome. Turn back. You're not welcome in this town. You would not like it here any way. Now git. Yawn!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read the free sample for the kindle and then purchase the iBooks version for my iPad. I had a credit on my account so that is why I got it from iBooks. I have read part of the first book and I do not know why some are saying that the writing is bad. I have come across one typo. The only issues I have had so far is that on the iBook version at least, the bottom of some letters are cut off at the bottom of the page. Since I have not finished the first book I can not say whether any of the last chapters are messed up.<br /><br />As for the story itself, it is a romance of sorts. I have only just finished reading about their (Christain & Ana) first weekend exercises. I can forsee some of what is going to happen next based on the dialogue in the story. I plan on reading the rest of the book as so far it is fine.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|This is a similar game as NemoNemo Picross (free on Google Play store).  But the interface is not as good.<br />There are way more puzzes in this CrossMe but IMO I dont like the interface as much as on NNP.<br />For example if you havea whloe row of pixels you want to select you can't just drag-select with your finger the whole row, you have to select each pixel individually.
B0007M22TI|5.0|This DVD is a basic of my  Celtic Woman  collection and it is just great. Marvellous to watch and listen to the Irish girls , a splendid production and therefore it' s just a 'must' for each fan.<br /> Really very good.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best bible app i have ever seen. i especially love the fact that i can listen while i am driving in my car
B005RYF5JA|5.0|A DVD acompanying  Celtic Woman's  tour of Germany these days.  Very beautiful and charming to join in to their concert. It's just wonderful and cute and I can run this DVD more than one time a day. Thank you very much  Celtic Woman  for great moments.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this series. I didn't want it to be over!! May not be for everyone but I found it helped me talk to my husband more and be more relaxed about our relationship. Thanks E.L.James!!
B004X4QW42|5.0|This movie was really good... I don't know what exactly people are so angry about... This isn't even close to a 1 star film. It's an inspiring martial arts movie.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I thought the overrall story was lovely, of course in theory. It was a complete sap story loaded with sex. I am not sure if this is a fairytale or an eroticaniore. But it was the typical troubled guy meets unexperience girl, falls in love happy ending. I continued to the third book because it was captivating, tho tainted by too many sex scenes.
B004EIZCPM|5.0|Cried a lot because I was laughing so hard I could not stop. Classic comedy with a twist. And Emma Stone is such a huge talent. Would highly recommend this to anyone having a bad day. It will turn your frown upside down and inside out....possibly backwards (I should have learned by now not to write reviews at 5:30am....)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I thought the games were going to be lame children games, and some of them are, but there are some fun and interesting games in the mix. Its a great time waster. I downloaded it yesterday and didn't realize I played it for hours at a time!  You get really into it and wanna unlock all the games and beat them all, all the while earning coins and stuff to buy more games. Its something simple and fun, and can be quite addicting. Well worth ZERO dollars. Doesn't hurt to try it out!<br /><br />Oh, and I usually don't take the time to write a review, but, being the great app it is, it offered me 250,000 coins just to rate the game. Couldn't pass that up!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best.  It does so much more than define and pronounce words.  everyday u get new information and games that stimulate more thinking.  Thank u for this great dictionary.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't stop reading....and I didn't. I spent the entire weekend doing nothing but reading. Very well written with every emotion. I have gotten several of my friend hooked as well. WTG E L James!!!
B003MC5N28|5.0|this book has depth and meaning and keeps you guessing! i kept reading because i wanted to know what being released was! again great book another one of lois's greater books
B007SYWFRM|5.0|it can be a little buggy, but overall it is addictive and fun. I can't wait for the updates to the kindle fire edition.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is great because its like words with friends and pictionary put together! Start a game with me my usernsme is CORAL SHARK
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I found this book to be an excellent and emotional read. I see that it's being compared to Fifty Shades but I found it to be a more believable erotic tale. I thought that Fifty went too far and the sex was soo over the top. I can't wait for the sequel!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Take the redundant sex out of this poorly written book and you have a ridiculous romance novel . The only interesting thing about this is the picture on the cover. How it has gotten so much press us beyond me. As poorly written as a b rated porn movie.
B00004T9UF|5.0|As I write this, today is the 12th anniversary of Marshall Mathers LP. This is still his best album. Every track on here is just brilliant (even though I find &#34;he Real Slim Shady&#34; kina annoying now, haha!) You can really feel his pain on these tracks, esp in &#34;Kim&#34;. If you're just getting into Eminem, you should get this album. I dont think you can say your'e a fan if you've yet to listen to this.
B007JM4CWY|1.0|There is no challenge to this game. It's  too easy.  How do they have the audacity to charge $5 for this? Glad I got it as the Free App of the Day!
B000NDJOO2|5.0|\\"Flags of Our Fathers\\", directed by Clint Eastwood, is a great, visually stunning piece of cinema about the soldiers responsible for the planting of the American flag on the beach of Iwo Jima during WW 2 and how it not only led to one of the most iconic photographs in military history but how it affected the lives and psyches of the soldiers who fought in that battle to take the island from the Japanese forces. Ryan Phillipe, Jesse Bradford, and Adam Beach play three of the soldiers and Eastwood does a masterful job exploring each character thoroughly and how what should have been a whirlwind, fun tour back home concerning their part in the planting of the flag on the island and promoting the photo as well as the cult of celebrity, but how they were just trying to keep their heads firmly together and letting people know they were \\"just young men doing their duty for their beloved USA\\". Sometimes, the media can prop soldiers up to be titans, but back home in the real world, reality can knock you down a peg when you least expect it. It's all about the proper prospective as far as being a man in the heat of battle is concerned, and who cares for your efforts and who doesnt when the guns stop firing. A great war film, and Eastwood's companion piece \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\" is even more powerful and heartbreaking.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like this app, but it feels more made for the iWhatevers than the Kindle. Guess OMGPOP didn't plan the Kindle through. Still works, though.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Needed a way to keep track of a variety of random information - this works! Sync between smartphone and kindle fire is handy.
0307949508|5.0|I recently joined a book club and it was decided to read the 2nd book in this trilogy, so I needed the book fast, but wanted to see if I was able to get a decent copy at a decent price and I did via Amazon. The book arrived quickly and in good shape..I would use this seller again.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a true documentary - not a pseudo-documentary.  I watched this on cable 3 times before deciding to buy a copy from Amazon.  When I watch documentaries I am very jaded and always watchful for bias - I detected none in this excellent work.  My reason for buying a copy of this documentary (from Amazon) is so that I can share it with my friends, so that they can see the truth.  This documentary is educational for many reasons - chief among them for providing exceptionally clear explanations of the various financial instruments (such as derivatives, hedge funds, etc.) which lead to the financial fiasco of 2008.  The documentary includes many graphs and charts which are exceedingly helpful to us simple folk to gain an understanding of these complex financial instruments and how they really work (or didn't, as was the case).<br /><br />As part of full disclosure, I consider myself to be a fiscally conservative libertarian republican.  Notwithstanding, I cannot abide cheats and dishonesty.  This documentary does an excellent job of exposing those folks who were cheats and dishonest, which lead to the financial collapse of 2008 from which the rest of us still suffer.  To that end, this documentary is not designed to pit the 99% against the 1% - it merely exposes that segment of the 1% that are criminals.<br /><br />I applaud the producers of this documentary for creating a work which respects the intelligence of the audience - they refrained from driving home obvious conclusions which can be reached after viewing the presented evidence.  My only hope it that the bulk of viewers of this work have enough intelligence to arrive at the obvious conclusions.<br /><br />Buy it, view it, and pass it along to others.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I had very high expectations for this movie and i was not disappointed when i finally saw it.  I do not think there has ever been a greater movie, including the beloved Star Wars saga!  I want to go see it again!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|this application is easy to use and works very similarly to the application that is used on the desktop or laptop
B004YM6JP0|5.0|The best vampire and love story out there! This show always keeps you guessing and the actors are so good at their roles it makes u feel like it could be real.
B007SGM084|1.0|I don't get the hype! Not impressed by \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" so far. Anyone who is willing to be dominated by someone else MIND, soul, and body. Especially a woman by a man is a complete turn off to me. And WILLING to sign a contract to do so... REALLY? I'm thinking what a waste of my money! If Ana doesn't expose Gray, bring his empire tumbling down and crushes his balls in the process. I'm done reading. Going back to \\"John Carter of Mars\\" It maybe sexist and cheesie, but better than insulting and demeaning. Wish I could get a refund for this series. I can't even finish book 1.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game so much... its my substitute for farmville. simple addictive cute wonderful!!!! no problems or anything with this game which is hard to find.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I downloaded it and was exicited to get youtube on my kindle and then I found out it on had plain videos and no REAL music!!!Don't get this app!!
B007Q2N0HA|1.0|This book is downright boring.  I skipped so many pages hoping it would get better and it never did.  The story never really kicks in.  It just drags on and on with no depth.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|Well made movie that gives a little more insight into the life of Hoover. Im not a big Leanardo fan but he did a great job in this one. Give it a watch if you have time.
B000XCZGPE|3.0|The sound quality was great, the record was in almost mint condition. But! I ordered \\"Straight Outta Compton [Vinyl]\\" and not \\"Straight Outta Compton 20 years anniversary edition whatever [Vinyl]\\"... Anyways it's the same thing except for the sleeve and some of the added songs, so, I'm pretty happy. 5/5 if I got the original one.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This app is GREAT I would recommend it to any puzzle enthusiast. Thanks for bringing such a great app to the market!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow!  This was a fantastic book to read.  I could not put the book down.  I got nothing done around the house and everyone had to fend for themselves till I finished the book.  Then I went out and got the second one, and then the third one.  Finished them all within a few days.  Fantastic writer, can't wait for more books by her.  I will be sure to line up for them.
B004EWFV9K|4.0|We read it for our book club. It was good. A little different from what we normally read. Good story but I like a clear cut ending....
B007R41E8O|4.0|Game is easy to navigate, thanks to hints and an object list that highlights when you are close to an object.  There are many scenes, and so many different areas to go to.  I would buy games from this developer again!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's not that The Hunger Games and Wool are all that similar.  Sure they're both dystopian tomes about society in a new dark age brought upon mankind by the evil within us.  But beyond that surface similarity, the two series' feel like they're written for two different audiences.  I devoured the Hunger Games - I really enjoyed them - but in the final analysis, they are particularly gruesome teenage fantasy novels.  Wool is more honest and immersive.  The characters are deeper, the inter-personal dynamics are more realistic and psychologically profound, the world is more plausible (well, somewhat more plausible), and the themes are more adult in focus.  What The Hunger Games did in caricature, Wool does with nuance.  The line between good and bad is cut and dry in the land of Panem, but not so in the Silo, where even the bad has a pretty good point.<br /><br />It's been years since I've read the Foundation Series, but to me Asimov's concept of preserving a seed of civil society within a universal decline is the closest analog to what Howey has done so well in Wool.  Both write with vision and nuance, both toy with the idea of a controlled chaos, and both allow for simultaneous perspectives into complex issues.  Wool is an excellent work by a talented thinker.  I look forward to more.<br /><br />By the way, if you like Wool, you'll probably also like Christian Cantrell's \\"Containment\\".  Another cheap Kindle book that I enjoyed recently.
B007R41E8O|1.0|This is one of the few apps I've paid for but I've never been able to play it, and I'm not at all happy about that. After I downloaded the game (I thought) and installed it, it started another download (downloading data files I guess). And once that finally finished - it started the same download again.<br /><br />I've tried uninstalling and re-installing, but it never does anything except that repeating download.  I don't plan to make any further purchases from this company, and I'll be a lot more careful about reading reviews before I take a chance on another app.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Recently saw Joe at the Landmark Theater in Syracuse with my son Joe.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|but updated where you could travel and go over the water and maybe sink...you can get a close version of it on my cell phone but not in the kindle markets
B005UDD1R6|5.0|I got the app to serve primarily as my video player , but it does a lot more than that. It works as a really nice tool to organize the media I have on my fire. I never knew what DLNA was before I got this app, but I'm sure glad I do now. It makes it very easy to set up a home network and access my music on my windows computer from anywhere in the house. I honestly couldn't be happier.
B00067BBQE|5.0|If you love Evanescence you will love the product. I love Evanescence and videos also. I have a very hard time buying videos. The downloads, I discovered, can be taken from you even though the software still indicates that you paid for it. As a result I have been looking for the videos I like on  physical dvds. This set gives you great audio, concert footage, and most importantly to me, actual music videos. I would highly recommend this product. You get a lot for your money. It is a great bargain!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|... A Free app of the day that ISN'T crap. Very challenging. My only issue is when the board gets bigger and the squares get smaller I hit ones I don't always hit the correct one. I have fat thumbs. =) there is a zoom feature which is nice, though.
044042321X|5.0|Ever since I heard about the plans for a graphic novel of Game of Thrones I was excited. I am a massive fan of the books and a fan of the HBO show as well and I couldn't wait to delve into Westeros once again in a different medium. I wasn't disappointed. The art in this is beautiful. Well designed characters and fantastic coloring really brings the story to life. This graphic novel stays MUCH closer to the source material. It's literally the book in visual form. I understand that some people have been disappointed at some of the creative license taken in the HBO show (Characters cut, characters added, new storylines, name changes) and although I understand why some of the changes have been made, you can't help but feel it's not exactly the world the George R R Martin had in mind. Not so with the graphic novel. No cuts here. This is the story and world and characters that George created. So if you're looking for Game of Thrones in a visual format, that stays true to the books, definitely give this a go. It's not the entire first book but they are still bringing out more. And you can't argue with the cheap price either. Looking forward to Volume 2!
B001HN6918|5.0|My 4yr old loves it. I dont mind watching it over and over with him. not an educational movie, but thats not the purpose. We love it.

B0034G4P80|4.0|Chris Hemsworth, Anthony Hopkins and Natalie Portman star<br />in Kenneth Branagh's 2011 action film based on the comics.<br />A arrogant warrior is banished to Earth and redeems himself<br />trying to save the universe. This is pretty good and Chris<br />is great as Thor. This dvd has nice picture and sound, but<br />only commentary, 4 deleted scenes and a teaser promo for<br />\\"The Avengers.\\" I recommend this.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|George Harrison: Living In The Material World [Blu-ray] (2012) is a MUST SEE documentary directed by the best in the business, Martin Scorsese. Along with input & personal archives provided from Olivia Harrison, and the many friends George has, made this a new standard by which any film maker should strive to achieve in their body of work for future productions of this type. The Blu-Ray format allows for stunning video as well as the 5.1 audio. As good as it gets. Any Beatles fan, George Harrison fan, music or docu-buff will want to see this film. A new bar has been set as the new standard for this type of work. Award worthy piece of history. Cudos to all involved. Mark Casey, Florida USA
6304712499|2.0|When Spawn hit the video shelves in 1997, it quickly became the top rental film amongst teenagers in our town. It was the coolest movie. You HAD to see it. Viewing it fifteen years later, I've come to learn a few things. Firstly, Spawn is a rather uninteresting, bland film. Secondly, I was quite gullible as a teenager.<br /><br />Today, Spawn's special effects range from average to really, really bad. The actors are of a B-movie quality, especially Martin Sheen, who should do us all a favour and stick to TV acting. I was frustrated, watching this film again after so many years, hoping it would improve as nostalgic memories came flooding back of happy times with friends, watching Spawn, gulping down buckets of popcorn and liters of soda while being very impressed with this cool new film!  Are teenagers really that impressionable? I guess I was.<br /><br />Nothing interesting happens in this film; the script moves predictably from one violent scene to the next. Character development is poor, or non-existing. The film is utterly devoid of humour. I can't recommend this movie. Perhaps, as a Spawn comic book fan, you might want to view this to see how it has  translated to the big screen. Don't expect greatness. The director of this film hasn't done anything noteworthy in the past fifteen years, which should tell you something.
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, Christian Grey filled my head and I found myself looking for every opportunity to read some more! Very well written, easy to get through.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|some of the most divine tunes ive heard in a long time. my favorites are perth and holocene - complex but peaceful.
0985114606|5.0|I read this book in one day, it was fabulous, although now I want to read more about the characters & the next book \\"Deeper in You\\" which follows it is not out yet. I'm hoping that Sylvia Day gets the next one out sooner than later. Altogether a great read!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game for the most part is fun.  Some games don't work as well as they should they have slow response times.  Overall good game though.
B007SWZVBQ|3.0|First of all let me tell whoever reads this that I REALLY LOVE GLEE. But now coming to the CD why is it that all the popular songs are not here? I mean where are \\"We Found Love\\" \\"La Isla Bonita\\" \\"Mean\\" \\"I Will Always Love You\\" \\"Big Girls Don't Cry\\"? Isn't there any space left for at list two or three from that list? I know it may be a business to sell both CD and single songs but some people like me also love to have the jewel case. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars only otherwise it is AMAZING. I would recommend it to any Glee fan =)
0345803485|5.0|I loved the three books...very romatic and erotic.<br />All my girlfriends have read it too and we all loved it.<br />Can't wait for book 4 & 5:D
B00772M1F6|5.0|This is the must-have album everyone's been talking about -it's an instant blues/roots blowout that will pull you onto the dance floor from the very first note. Fans of Wynonie Harris, Nick Curran, Little Richard, et al, will NEED this platter in their collection. The story is that JD (Jonathan David) McPherson, ex singer/guitarist of THE STARKWEATHER BOYS, took a trip from Broken Arrow, OK to Chicago, IL and recorded 10 originals & 2 covers at the Hi-Style studios where musical magic happened. Fusing JD's Okie-billy spirit with vintage up-town soul, JD, with Jimmy Sutton and Alex Hall, has brewed a thrilling and rocking R'n'B release, sure to please rockers, dancers and retro-blues fans.<br /><br />\\"North Side Gal\\" honks straight out of the box; it twists, jives & rolls with enviable ease. Country-bopper \\"Wolf Teeth\\" and the smokin' stroller \\"Fire Bug\\" are balanced by the introspective and somber \\"Signs & Signifiers\\" and \\"A Gentle Awakening.\\" JD's voice soars like Jackie Wilson's on my favorite number, \\"Scratching Circles,\\" co-written by producer Jimmy Sutton (FOUR CHARMS, MIGHTY BLUE KINGS), another joyous blues shouter about cutting loose at the VFW hall after softening your soles with dancers salt! True blues hounds will dig JD's swaggering guitar on \\"I Can't Complain\\" and hoofers will enjoy the East Coast rhythms of \\"Dimes For Nickels.\\" The second crown jewel of this LP is the brilliant BELLFURIES cover, \\"Your Love (All That I'm Missing).\\" Wonderfully incorporating Jon Doyle and Josh Bell's hot saxophones with Joel Patterson's jive guitar -this track is WHITE HOT!<br /><br />\\"Signs\\" is a superb slice of danceable roots-rockabilly & jump blues that deserves to be in your collection. Slip on your cowboy boots, grease back your hair and wear that diamond horseshoe pin with pride!
1250000971|5.0|I enjoyed his book, although I do confess I liked  the first book a bit better. Readers were told that this would be a trilogy,  so it was to be expected that there would be a cliffhanger  at the end of the second book. The villains got their due, (Uncle Stan ?)  and the good people triumphed. I will say that Harry seems to have more lives than a cat, a point he mentions at one point.  Enjoy !
B007JM4CWY|4.0|im not very good at these type of games but if i was im sure it would fun. very simple graphics and layout. easy to follow tutorial wich is helpfull. very challenging at best. i liked it enough to do a review.good job yet again thnx ethan!!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Been looking for one of these for a while. Great for free, plenty of puzzles. Good interface too on Galaxy Tab 10.1
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Like many other reviewers, I had a really hard time putting this book down.  Although I think its a stretch to call this work science fiction, the story was incredibly engaging.  Many of the ideas are pleasantly fresh.  In terms of the way the 5 stories engaged me, it was reminiscent of Pillars of the Earth.  I'd give Wool (Omnibus) six stars of I could.
B0083YV1GW|5.0|&#34;Think for yourself 'cause I won't be there with you.&#34; -- George Harrison, 1965<br /><br />You've just got to love the cover, which is a spoof of the Beatles' 1969 Abbey Road album cover. They say you can't judge a book by its cover, but I think I did when I judged that this would be one I would like! It's a riot!<br /><br />Penny Lane, who shares her name with a 1967 Paul McCartney with the Beatles classic is so over boys. (Her two sisters are Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds and Lovely Rita. I'm surprised one wasn't named Michelle). After a traumatic breakup with her former boyfriend Nate, she forms The Lonely Hearts Club minus Sgt. Pepper. She swears off high school boys as she feels they don't show proper respect for women. Other girls join her club in droves. Her school principal, who is a man naturally chafes at the club as do the male students. Penny Lane does have a change of lonely heart when she meets a boy with a Beatle haircut. Something in the way he moves, perhaps? &#34;I left you far behind/The ruins of the life that you have in mind./And though you still can't see/I know your mind's made up/You're gonna cause more misery.&#34; George Harrison, 1965 from &#34;Think For Yourself&#34;<br /><br />Penny and her Hearts are in-your face and live by John Lennon's credo in &#34;Instant Karma&#34; about how Instant Karma's gonna get you, gonna knock you right in the face. She is somewhat Lennonesque with her in-your-face rebellion and delightfully zany wit. Like John Lennon, she and her fellow Hearts refuse to compromise their true voices and identity and swear off pretending to agree with someone just to win them over or pacify them. Any time somebody gives up their honest voice by pretending to be something they are not and by saying they agree with something they do not, they are stifling their identity. I hate that kind of toadying behavior and Penny and her Hearts wisely empower themselves to dodge that self-defeatist behavior. John Lennon's 1971 &#34;Crippled Inside&#34; is a good anti-toady song. At no time do the Hearts sacrifice their voices. That makes one think of John Lennon's greeting, &#34;John here, speaking with his voice!&#34; from the 1963 Beatles' Christmas album. What an empowering statement!<br /><br />The Hearts' theme song could be Paul McCartney's late 1977 hit, &#34;I've Had Enough! (I can't put up with any more).&#34; All Long & Winding Roads lead to the Beatles and that is what makes this book such a treat.<br /><br />&#34;Although your mind's opaque, try thinking more if just for your own sake.<br />The future still looks good and you've got time to rectify all the things that you should.&#34; -- George Harrison, 1965 from &#34;Think For Yourself&#34;<br /><br />The sheer genius of this book, with its empowering story, strong characters and WONDERFUL plethora of Beatle references will delight readers, whether they are Beatle fans or not. Beatle fans will especially enjoy this because not only will they &#34;get&#34; the Beatle references, they will love them! Aspie Beatle fans will love Penny's parents who, while the word is never mentioned are plainly Aspies with the Beatles as a special interest.<br /><br />Penny is delightfully funny and she bravely shares some horrific experiences. To make a good thing even better, she was born on Beatles' Day, February 7, the anniversary of the day the Beatles came to America! The daughter of two ardent inveterate Beatle fans, Penny develops a love for the Beatles early and even wants a Hey Bulldog for a pet. The social dynamics and social hierchy are given in plain terms and the story is one that pulls you in right away. You will travel down the Long & Winding Road with Penny Lane and her fellow Hearts as they get by with a little help from their friends as they learn that in the end the love you take is equal to the love you make. The Hearts convert &#34;A Hard Day's Night&#34; into a &#34;Good Day Sunshine&#34; and soon are singing &#34;I Feel Fine.&#34; The Beatles remain a comforting presence throughout the book and a driving force that impels Penny and her fellow Hearts as well.<br /><br />A heartfelt kudos and thank you to Elizabeth Eulberg. These delightful characters are wonderfully empowering and the Beatle humor brings big smiles to readers' faces. No doubt readers will take some ideas away after having read this book. If you listen to the Beatles while reading this work by this gifted Paperback Writer, you will increase your reading pleasure.<br /><br />John Lennon's 1970 &#34;Instant Karma,&#34; Paul McCartney's 1977 &#34;I've Had Enough&#34; and George Harrison's 1965 &#34;Think For Yourself&#34; underscore a good portion of this book. So do these Beatle classics: &#34;I'll Be Back,&#34; &#34;She Loves You,&#34; &#34;This Boy,&#34; &#34;It Won't Be Long&#34; and &#34;The Long & Winding Road&#34; which are the soundtrack of this book together with &#34;I Want to Tell You,&#34; a 1966 George Harrison classic. This gets a high endorsement and a hearty yeah, yeah, yeah from me! I love this book!<br /><br />Beatles Forever!driving force that impels Penny and her fellow Hearts as well.

0385474547|3.0|I'm kidding in my question, but the first 75% of the book reminded me of science fiction: it described a culture so alien in their thought patterns that I had a hard time recognizing it as human.<br /><br />Spoilers ahead:<br /><br />I thought it was instinctive of humans  of all cultures to love their children and bond with them.  So I was surprised and chilled when the main character kills a boy that had lived with his family for 3 years and was his son's playmate.  The killing occurs because an \\"oracle\\" orders it.<br /><br />Similarly the clan abandons all twins at birth to die in the forest.  Seems contrary to human nature to me, but I suppose other cultures have their examples of \\"inhumane\\" behavior predicated on some religious rule.<br /><br />The book is probably hard to read for many because the first 50% of it has no plot, but just seems to be a series of incidents of tribal life. I listened to the audio version and I accidentally listened to disc 3 before disc 2, and didn't even realize it until I went to swap in the next disk.  That gives you some sense of how little \\"story\\" there is in the first half of the book.<br /><br />Some plot creeps in around the 3rd quarter of the book when the main character commits a crime and is sent into exile.<br /><br />The last 25% of the book that describes conflict with Christian Englishmen is the most interesting.  I'm an atheist, but I didn't dislike the missionaries as much I had expected I would, probably because the African tribal customs they were challenging were so repellant.<br /><br />The narrator of the audio version is excellent and really brought out the poetry of the writing.  That probably helped me get through the first half of the book a little more easily.  I have found audio books to be more accessible for some other \\"classics\\" of literature that are a bit dry to read.  Just a suggestion to any high school students (or teachers).
0345803493|5.0|I won't fill you in on the synopsis--plenty of sources to do that. If you are looking for some GRAPHIC material, you'll be disappointed. If you would like a semi-romantic plot developed around a sexathon, this is for you.<br /><br />Out of the three of the novels, I like this one best. Seemed the one you could relate to most (if a sullen college grad girl, that is.) Of course I want to marry a Christian Grey. However, I don't want to have an internal struggle with my \\"inner goddess\\" or \\"sub conscious\\"  on every flipping page. I'd like to just let it be what it is--let a wealthy billionaire ravish me and then fall in love with me. What's so unrealistic about that?<br /><br />James is a good author. Redundant, but a good read ;)<br /><br />Cheers!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|..............SPOILERS AHEAD ...............i have to say i loved the hunger games but in mockingjay katniss loses her inner spark and becomes weaker and weaker even the marriage to her true love and the birth of her children doesn't make her the tiniest bit happy. i mostly read it to find out what happens to peeta. i was thinking if he dies im going to be so mad. overall it was pretty good
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Good game great fun. glue = great fun samurai and zombies is there anything better? I think not!! action packed goodness
0375842209|5.0|From beginning to end, Zusak fills every void of this story of a girl and her books with vivid detail and raw emotions. The Book Thief is full of creative aspects that make it a book to remember. Each character brings their aspect of World War Two into reality. Leisel Memenger, Max Vandenberg, Hanz and Rosa Hubberman, and Rudy Steiner were all main characters with very different stories and personalities.  Going through the war in the eyes of death made the book stand out amongst the many others about World War Two.<br />Though a fictional book, there were non-fictional aspects to The Book Thief. Bombings, Hitler youth, the treatment of the Jews, were all real in the war. To go further and say that The Book Thief can be called historical fiction would more specifically classify it. The tone of the book was one of a somewhat blunt nature. To feel the struggle that the characters feel is something that Zusak allows his readers to do. With a somber mood, readers are able to identify sadness and pity when the characters feel those emotions. Although the whole war was a struggle, the simply pleasure in life, such as first love, great friends, trust, and the returning of a loved one can be shared with the main characters by readers.<br />Anyone who is looking for a page turner is one who would enjoy The Book Thief. Opening eyes of readers to how the war in Germany affected so many was something that Zusak was successful in doing. Being that I have read this book twice now, I can easily say that it is one of my all-time favorite books, if not my favorite.  As a touching story of a girl who loses everything yet still finds hope in life, this book can be looked at as a way to overcome anything, even if it is fiction.  Using the struggle and hardships of World War Two and by looking at the motives of those powerful leaders at that time in a different way puts The Book thief on a whole different level from an y other book with the same intentions. Going through readers emotions is what gets a book the kind of praise that The Book Thief has received.<br /> Looking at all the ways Zusak has changed the point of view of World War Two, I honestly cannot see a way of improving the book. Recommended for all, The Book Thief has made its way into my heart.
0307454568|2.0|Okay, so this book was a page-turner with interesting characters; that's why I gave it 2 stars instead of a dismal 1.  This book perpetuates all the myths about mental illness. Psychopathy=mental illness is one of the most commonly untrue beliefs held in our society.  Psychopathy isn't a mental illness, it's a disorder that involves a simply deficient conscience.  Psychopaths are not mentally ill.  Another annoyance: the idea that people with mental illnesses aren't intelligent.  That is ridiculous. John Nash Jr. is not a weird exception to the rule. I should know.  I work for two non-profit organizations for the  mentally ill.  Most of the people I know are non-violent and have above-average IQs.  This book should not be believed.  How unfortunate it is that it's so popular, feeding the stereotypes.
B000022TSV|5.0|I have the VHS copy of this opera, and the comparison to the DVD you sent is considerably better. I am well satisfied with the producy and the service.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This is by far my favorite Josh Groban album. It's been great seeing him evolve as an artist, and the songs on this album really have a personal feeling to them. Anything he sings sounds amazing, but I hope he doesn't look back. I hope he continues to explore his abilities and write his own songs, because they have a soul his other songs don't.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|My original review, from May 2012, was very negative.  Since then, I have re-installed the game and the only problem I have is being smart enough to complete the various puzzles.  This game is challenging, helps keep my mind active and sharp... and is addictive.  Highly recommend it!
B000I5X81K|3.0|This is probably my own fault for not paying closer attention to the track listings. I just assumed that the album called \\"Awake\\" would have the song of the same title on it, and was incredibly disappointed when I put the cd in my car and went through all the tracks only to ultimately discover that the song wasn't there. Apparently you have to buy a special edition of this album to get \\"Awake\\" as one of the tracks.<br />This hasn't been my favorite album. I like several of the songs, but not all of them. I love his \\"Illuminations\\" album, though. I feel like the \\"Awake\\" album is him trying to please everyone, doing some of his \\"usual\\" songs along with some of his newer ideas, and I have to say I like his newer ideas much better. It's great to see him evolving as an artist, but if I could do it over I'd just buy the songs I liked from this album individually instead of buying the whole album. (Then I could have gotten the song I really wanted, too!)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love-love, this book! Look forward to reading it over & over again. I highly recommend it to everyone. This book did not disappoint and I found it very hard to put it down.
B007C4ZJ0S|2.0|There are spoilers...<br /><br />That's the theme of the movie, something happened in Barcelona. No one seems to know what happened but everyone wants to know. I'll tell you what happened in Barcelona, she didn't like loose ends. Which of course means she'll chase someone for about 15 minutes through the streets of Spain, after being shot at by said person, all so she can hit him a few times and leave him alive. In the end she tells her team mates who ask, 'where'd you go?', that she doesn't like loose ends... Cause when I think of tieing up loose ends, I'm talking about punching someone a couple times then walking away after they took me on a 15 minute chase... Fail.<br />So much more but I won't ruin the rest in case someone wants to watch it for an action flick. If it was intended to be a cheesey comedy with a little action, then it was...acceptable... But a rock your sox off action flick of epic proportions...no.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|This movie seems alright.<br /><br />It wasn't exactly what I expected after seeing the trailer. It could've been better, but I can't, at this time, be specific on how. - It is just something that doesn't quite seem right... like knowing you've forgotten something, but not knowing what it is.
1600108512|5.0|I now have three copies of this book. Two of this exact one (thought one was lost, then found it after purchasing the replacement), and the brand new Deluxe Edition. The comic book has amazing art, colorful, and it takes your breathe away. This comic is great for any unicorn lover, comic lover, or Beagle lover!
B005CA4SJW|5.0|So okay, I've been reading about the \\"double dipping\\" and yes I kind of been resisting purchasing this 3 disk special edition, because I already had the original season 1 DVD set. But when I finally have in I bought the Special Edition & gave my original season 1to my nephew, who of course is a fellow Walking Dead fan fanatic!<br /><br />So, now that I have the Season 1 Special Edition I absolutely enjoyed the addition of the 3rd disk, and really didn't mind spending the $$.$$ for it. The extras in the 3rd disk were really entertaining & informative to only the serious Walking Dead Freak-A-Zoids!!! But what I absolutely really liked was the Black & White version of the season 1 Pilot Show! That from my POV was much better the the colored version that we all saw on AMC! So this 3 disk season 1 special edition dose deserve the 5 stars I gave it! Simply because \\"I liked it!\\" and no my name isn't Mikey!!! Robert Kirkman & The Walking Dead Kicks @$$
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I love puzzles and this is a great one. no timer,  lots of puzzles. tutorial at start,  def. use that (took me a few minutes and had to backtracked a couple times to fully get the instructions)!  saves work if you are part way through. can make bigger using &quot;pinch &quot;/&quot;stretch &quot; technique which id necessary for the larger puzzles (and I don't have large fingers so most people will probably need to do this) . no glitches on kindle fire. highly recommend!!
030788743X|5.0|There is only 5 words needed to describe this book. \\"just go buy it already\\". It is a must read seriously great great book for a first time author.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|It's just ok to me.  Glad this one was free because this game is definitely not worth five bucks. Maybe .99 but definitely outrageous at $4.95
B003LQMZS0|5.0|I bought this toy just to keep my baby busy when she is in her car seat but she loved this toy so much that I attached it to her rocker and she plays with it several times a day.<br /><br />Each leg has a different sensory stimulating activity. There is a black and white rattle, a mirror, a red flat teether and a bead chaser with multiple textures. The giraffe in itself is quite attractive. It is said that a  baby less than 5 month old likes black, white, yellow and red. This toy has all these colors.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, this is one of the very few toys that lasts long . I bought it when my baby was 2 months old. At that time she  used to stare at the rattle and mirror. At 3 and 4 months, she would bat at the toys. Now at 5 months, she would put everything in her mouth. Except for the rattle, everything is easy to chew on and that helps her when she has teething discomfort.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this toy.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|i luv this game it's  both challenging and free. probably a lot of other people like it too.the only thing about it is that it needs a major update
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game...reminds me of The Sims but cheaper. Sucks that I switched phones and lost all my progress but its not too bad cause I got to get a better start.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Bought this book originally for my daughter...but since was in my kindle I decided to read, was a great book..easy to follow....not an avid reader these days but was good distraction from everyday life. I enjoyed it!
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Phantom Orion is a good bey. His performance tip can spin and I might even mix his spin track it's so cool. The fusion wheel can really destroy a bey. The energy ring is the coolest looking part because you put the sticker under the energy ring and it looks like it has eyes with a mouth b/c the mouth is from the fusion wheel. The face bolt has the coolest picture I have. And I have Torch Gemios, Thunder Leone, Galaxy Pegasus, Evil Pisces, Ultimate Meteo L-Drago, Flame Byxis, Earth Virgo, Burn Fireblaze, Scorpio (mixed bey), Thermal Pisces, Electro Pegasus, Pegasus Jumper, and Kerbecs Blade Blast.<br /><br />Phantom Orion is the BEST! Everyone should have this Bey.
1613771355|1.0|Although the hardcover looks great I bought this item because it was listed as signed and numbered. It is neither. Worse, it isn't the book but is a graphic novel. Worse than that is the fact that I gave it as a gift and found out all of the above when they opened it.<br /><br />At least a partial refund is in order. An explanation is DEFINITELY in order.

B00004BZ16|4.0|The most rehashed line critics use when analyzing The Clash's controversial \\"Sandinista!\\", originally released as a triple-LP following their indisputable masterpiece \\"London Calling,\\" is that somewhere among the original three discs lies a wonderful single-disc. And the great thing about that is, whichever songs you choose to whittle your single helping of the most stunning advances in punk music, there's something for everyone. Most fans will cite the classics contained on \\"Sandinista!\\", usually being 'The Magnificent Seven,' 'Police On My Back,' 'Somebody Got Murdered,' 'Hitsville UK,' and 'Charlie Don't Surf.' But just as well are some incredible Clash gems, all too often glossed over amidst the slew of music the album contains, most notably 'The Street Parade,' 'Washington Bullets,' 'Lose This Skin,' 'Broadway,' 'Junco Partner,' 'Corner Soul,' and 'Kingston Advice.' Or, for the more dedicated - and patient - of fans, there are curios/oddities/throwaways/experiments, whatever cliched adjectives with which the critics like to describe them - such as 'One More Dub,' 'The Sound of Sinners,' 'Shepherds Delight,' 'Version Pardner,' 'Career Opportunities,' 'Mensforth Hill,' and 'Silicone on Sapphire.'<br />Among some of the more difficult - but worthwhile - tracks like 'Junkie Slip,' 'If Music Could Talk,' 'Living In Fame,' or 'Version City,' it seems The Clash and Joe Strummer are trying to express something important, but the message often becomes obscured by the abundance of studio wizardry and multiple musical layers.<br />\\"Sandinista!\\" is, whichever tracks one likes or hates, or even if you hate them all, without question evidence that The Clash were the hardest working punk band of their time. \\"The CNN of punk,\\" as Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian described them. And more impressive is that this triple-album didn't even yield all of the studio output the band produced during this time. With their unblinking political stances added to a myriad of influences and mediums ranging from pop, reggae, rockabilly, funk, gospel, and even children's music, \\"Sandinista!\\" may be a difficult album to accept, but hard evidence as to why The Clash blew every other punk band in existence out of the water.s ranging from pop, reggae, rockabilly, funk, gospel, and even children's music, \\"Sandinista!\\" may be a difficult album to accept, but hard evidence as to why The Clash blew every other punk band in existence out of the water.

0345803485|5.0|At first I was appalled by the way the book was taking off, it was very over the top with its sex scenes but once you read on you understand why and that it is not as bad as you think. They have rules in this book and lines that are not meant to be crossed. What I advise people to do is be patient and open minded at first when reading this book and you will discover that it really is quite interesting and good! I have to tell everyone that is like me- the read at the end of the book type people before starting to read it, do not do it! Leave it a suprise because it will leave you wanting more! Good luck and enjoy!
1936891026|5.0|I was surprised I hadn't heard of this book.  So, I snatched up a copy when I did.  It didn't cost much.  You can read it really fast, or slowly.  Now, I carry it with me all the time.  It might just change your life, if you let it.  Dare yourself to read this book.

0345803507|4.0|There are life's guilty pleasures, and then there is the guiltiest spectacle of them all: the Fifty Shades of Grey spectacle. It's time to review this precious pearl of literary genius, so I'm going to dive on in. Hold me.<br /><br />When we last left our romantic icons, Ana Steele and Christian Grey, they were newly engaged and facing (a) Ana's ex-boss, Jack Hyde, whom Christian fired in a fit of jealous pique when Jack made a pass at Ana and (b) Christian's \\"Mrs. Robinson,\\" the woman who initiated him into his life of BDSM. Can these two crazy love birds find happiness and contentment? Thank goodness E. L. James doesn't keep us hanging and gives us the GIFT that is Fifty Shades Freed.<br /><br />The tale opens just after Christian and Ana's wedding, as the two bask on their European honeymoon. They bicker, rock the headboard, bicker some more, and have make-up rocking of the headboard. While enjoying their romantic interlude, Christian learns that someone apparently tried to sabotage part of his building. Enter the \\"plot\\" portion of the festivities. The threat to Grey Enterprises increases, and we are meant to be on the edge of our seats in anticipation of how this AWFUL THING will transpire. There also continues to be friction in the Grey marriage. These two argue about the same damn thing all the time, followed by furious headboard rockin'.<br /><br />So there's your story.<br /><br />While this one shares certain similarities with Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker, in Fifty Shades Freed, James actually attempts - gulp - style. There are flashbacks, seemingly set at even intervals, but then mysteriously dropped. Until, that is, the epilogue, where they show up again. Clearly E. L. James realized that we don't read these books for STYLE. I mean, really.<br /><br />Let's get to the good stuff, shall we? Because, let's face it: we also do not read these books for their plot. Please. There are more important things to anticipate.<br /><br />THE BUTT PLUG SHOWS UP!!!!!<br /><br />I know some of you have waited in breathless anticipation, and you will not be denied! We also meet the flogger AND the cross is used AND the grid. Insert jumpy claps here. Christian and Ana continue to Know Each Other in the Biblical Sense in different locales, including - but not limited to - an airplane, a yacht, a couch, a shower, a bathtub, a picnic blanket and - thank GOD - the red satin bed in the Red Room of Pain.<br /><br />But you know what is not used in any romantic situation whatsoever? The grey tie! I am bereft with grief. I got attached to that tie, and while it makes a brief appearance, it does not do so wrapped around anyone's appendages. It's a tease, and I am not amused.<br /><br />Also missing: any sign of a competent, coherent editor. What IS present is the same repetitious writing. It takes less than three pages for the first smirk to appear. And this time? Christian and Ana aren't the only two who smirk. Other characters get in on the action. I suspect that E. L. James is f-ing with me. We also get bitten lips, rolled eyes, lips pressed into a hard line, frowns and sighs.<br /><br />But a new play has entered the repertoire: Christian rubs his nose down the length of Ana's nose.<br /><br />Naturally, this being E. L. James, he does that A LOT. Almost as often as one of them says, \\"Hmmm.\\" Clearly the message is that in the absence of the ability to write dialogue, insert a breathy moan.<br /><br />And now, an excerpt. Feel free to use this as an interpretive dialogue:<br /><br />Hmm ... my Fifty wants to tumble.<br /><br />\\"Don't bite your lip,\\" he warns.<br /><br />Compliantly, I release my lip. \\"I think you have me at a disadvantage, Mr. Grey.\\" [They call each other Mr. and Mrs. Grey ALL THE TIME, as if they forgot their first names.] I bat my lashes and squirm provocatively beneath him. This could be fun.<br />\\"Disadvantage?\\"<br /><br />\\"Surely you've already got me where you want me?\\" He smirks [!!!!! - of course hedoes] and presses his groin into mine once more.<br /><br />Ah, language. Its mellifluous use is a lost art, isn't it? Thank goodness E. L. James is here to reinvigorate writing.<br /><br />As I typed that, I mistakenly wrote \\"goddess,\\" rather than \\"goodness.\\" That brings me to another repetition: Ana's subconscious, complete with the half moon glasses and disdain, shows up again. The inner goddess is not as present, but that subconscious school marm sure is. Oh, lucky us.<br /><br />So is Fifty Shades Darker worth the read? OF COURSE IT IS. You can't stop at their engagement! You need to read about the wedding and the honeymoon and the corporate intrigue and the early months of their marriage and the in-laws and the Evil Ex-Employee and the Evil Ex-Dominatrix. You can't stop at the second one! You must read this!<br /><br />Oh, it's awful. Don't get me wrong about that. It is just as badly written and edited as its predecessors. But, as I have said before, it is literary crack. So bad for you, but so addicting.<br /><br />A plus: at the end, we get a brief glimpse of Christian's point of view. And then - AND THEN - E. L. James says, \\"That's all ... for now.\\"<br /><br />OH MY GOD - THERE WILL BE MORE! Please let it be. For the love of Mark Twain, PLEASE LET THERE BE MORE.<br /><br />This review originally appeared on cupcake's book cupboard.does] and presses his groin into mine once more.<br /><br />Ah, language.

I ended up reading this book in one day, and bought the other 2 right away, that is how much I loved it.  It took me 3 1/2 days to finish all three books and I'm kinda sad its over. I wanted more !!

B006N57PXG|5.0|This is one of those series I reread once a year. It's one of those that come to my mind first when thinking of a wonderful, brilliant set of books to recommend to people. I recommend this over Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Dark Materials, Ender, etc.<br /><br />Jonathan Stroud seems to have concentrated all his best writing into the three books; his other novels are not nearly as good. Amulet of Samarkand introduces you to Bartimaeus, a 5th level djinni, and Nathaniel, the child magician who summons him for revenge. Bartimaeus' chapters are peppered with smartass footnotes throughout, hilariously providing background on Bartimaeus as a djinni, clarifications on some of his thoughts, or just wise-cracking. Nathaniel summoned him for revenge, but gets more than he can handle.<br /><br />The Bartimeaus Trilogy has fallen under the radar. It's a shame, since it's so wonderful. Nathaniel is not a perfect protagonist. He acts immorally and selfishly. Bartimaeus is not an evil djinni. He does what he is ordered to do but he mostly wants to be left alone. The first book does a good job giving the background behind both Bartimeaus and Nathaniel, while also planting the clues for later books.<br /><br />Read this series. It's among the best out there.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|Love it!!  There's only one track that I don't care to listen to but the rest are great.  Great cd to listen to when driving distances as its upbeat to keep you alert.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is a bit like Starship Troopers, except with the fate of the world resting on a child's shoulders.<br /><br />Ender is a Third, allowed because of the brilliance his older brother and sister have. He demonstrates his willingness to defend himself at all costs, and he is sent off to be trained against the \\"buggers.\\" There he meets several other brilliant children, including the tiny Bean, who all train in games that develop their strategy. Ender stands out as a brilliant strategist and his players become very loyal to him. All throughout, he maintains a deep empathy.<br /><br />This was the first book I read by Orson Scott Card. I loved his brilliant characters (even now, when I know he has brilliant children all the time in his books), his game within a game, and how he resolves the tenuous relationships Ender has with his siblings (or doesn't). If there is one thing I wish Card had done more of, whether in this book or in sequels, is go into detail the circumstances that led to the tight government control where people were not allowed to have more than two children. The history behind that is alluded to, but not really built.<br /><br />I am very pleased to see this be made into a movie, and I'm eager to see how Asa Butterfield handles the character. I'm sure he'll be brilliant.

B004G600A4|4.0|Tangled is good, especially compared to the Princess and the Frog, which is a total disaster. I am talking about the plot, not the art work. There's nothing to complain when it comes to Disney art, but when will Disney (or other movie makers) ever learn that the plot is the most important point of a movie? Not the actors, not the special effects, not the music -- the plot!<br /><br />Other people seem to like the Princess and the Frog. Good for them, but more people like Tangled. The Frog story grossed 260 million; Tangled grossed 670 million. Almost three times. To me, that's totally right.<br /><br />Tangled's plot is pretty good, making the movie interesting all the way to the end. I do have a problem with the ending, though. For one thing, the bad witch fell to her death -- just like Snow White's bad witch! And further more, the relationship between the girl and her adopted mother is too easily erased. No matter what, that's the mother she knows her whole life and the only person she's ever interacted with. That relationship shouldn't be dismissed even if the mother isn't so wonderful, in my mind. She was at least fairly nice for a mother. The girl once asked for something, and the mother agreed to get it. Not like Cinderella's step mom, who was nothing but mean.<br /><br />I would say Tangled was worth watching. But it was nothing like the great movies of my childhood such as Aladdin or even Beauty and the Beast. I don't think it has the Disney magic.<br /><br />I think Disney movies are on its way out. Look at the recent disaster called John Carter. Pixar's new movie Brave is looking rather promising right now, or I would have said that Pixar's on its way out too. It's been rehashing old plots the last few years. But I suspect Pixar is going to run out of good ideas real soon.<br /><br />Disney's been busy buying stuff like ESPN and Marvel, plus building the Shanghai Disneyland. I think it's a huge mistake. They are forgetting who they are. They need to concentrate more in making good movies. For Disney to crank out a disaster is unforgivable. It sullies the great Disney name.<br /><br />But, I suppose all good things must come to an end. Oh well, at least I still got to enjoy all that is great about Disney.trate more in making good movies. For Disney to crank out a disaster is unforgivable. It sullies the great Disney name.<br /><br />But, I suppose all good things must come to an end. Oh well, at least I still got to enjoy all that is great about Disney.

B001UE27X8|5.0|Tony Bennett at his best with one of the best jazz pianists of the day - The performances are truly excellent, the songs timeless, and the recording quality very good.  This recording proves that it doesn't take a glitzy \\"star\\", 40 musicians, and 100+ hangers-on, which seems to be the mode for current pop, to make music.  Here we have two artists who know exactly what they are doing and the result is wonderful music.

B000FVQLQQ|3.0|If you truly like this movie..take the time to read the book. You will find its not as charming as the movie and the abuse and harm he caused was of great concern. He is a genius, but it was not a goverment caused stress..it was plain and simple mental illness.  Their wedding was not all rainbows and unicorns..they were divorced for many years while he was locked up or traveling aboard. He was selfish and drained his mothers and family's finances. Read the book to find out how it really was.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|So looking forward to getting my pre-order in the mail, maybe tomorrow?  Love love love this band, have \\"known\\" Susan for probably 10 yrs when she toured in support of Buddy Guy and that realm... Derek is so much fun to watch as you absorb his almost zen demeanor and blissful sound. The live band is so FULL, the dueling drums make it for me.  My sadness is that I was unsuccessful in influencing the addition of \\"Make Me Smile\\" when the question of what to include here was asked... hearing that live in last summer's Milwaukee performance has stuck tight in my soul. Give this band several listens and you'll be hooked... for GOOD.<br /><br />OK, the disc arrived today. It does not make me happy to say this, but I guess I am underwhelmed.  So many of the songs are familiar from Revelator and I think I will continue to prefer the studio versions.  Does anyone else think the band sounds \\"tired\\" ??  I really love Bound for Glory and was impressed by Derek's guitar work, but in the extended version it felt kind of muddy; I get a feel of jazz influence in parts that I wouldn't have expected. It seems like some of the keys have been dropped a step or so, maybe the touring took a toll on Susan's voice?<br /><br />Sadly, I don't think I'll be listening to this much; still love the earlier versions.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This concert on Blu Ray is simply stunning.  The picture quality and sound are truly amazing.  Having seen her in Portland last summer and been in the second row, I can honestly say that this is in some ways even better than being there.  OK when you are there you are seeing her live, and it is very thrilling, especially when she comes across the stage and looks right at you and your wife and smiles, but there are people around you talking, and you are so close that you can't see the forest through the trees, and you can't appreciate some of the lighting/visual effects, or see very well at all when the semitransparent curtain on to which they project images comes down.  On this disc, everything is ultra clear, and you get a full sense of the stage.  This is a brilliantly done production without many distracting crowd shots or choppy editing.  Sade is stunning, just stunning, as is the lighting/effects, and I would just like to say thank you Sade for being so beautiful in every way and for giving us your music and this fantastic show.  At the concert I found myself inadvertently yelling out \\"Thank you Sade!\\", but that is how I really feel, just so grateful.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|First off, Krakaur is a brilliant biographer.  His knowledge, depth and resarch on McAndless is un-parelled.  The detective work he took part in to comprise this book is honorable.<br /><br />As for McAndless we have an individual deeply rooted in the thoughts of Thoreau and a open view of the probelems of western modernistic society.  Unlike the rest of us though, McAndless actually lived out his life in regard to those ideals, not as lofty dialogue, but as a way of life.<br /><br />A life dedicated to freedom, respect of people, adventure, simplicity, respect to the Creator, and a life without limit.<br /><br />A tragic story yes, but also one of great inspiration.
1594203334|5.0|Another fantastic book by Pamela Druckerman. She really knows how to present her interviews and cultural observations in a way that stimulates the reader to question what they know and to continue to reading to discover more. Finally a voice that has hit upon \\"problems\\" that I see in today's American parenting. While I don't believe that the French have perfected parenting, reading another view point reminds me that there are many ways to get the job done and that perhaps Americans are just taking a harder, more strenuous path to raising kids.

B005LAIHKY|1.0|The only reason I went to see Dark Shadows is because I'm a big fan of Johnny Depp! I'll never make that mistake again! Like most actors, Johnny will do just about anything to make a buck! Storytelling as an art? What's that? And, who cares anyway? 2012 is turning out to the worst year in decades (and I have been going to the movies for over 40 years, so that's saying something) for really bad blockbusters: first, Hunger Games; next, The Avengers; and now Dark Shadows!<br /><br />Here are some of the twisted messages you will find in Dark Shadows, which is a mere shadow of the 1960's TV series (pun intended)! It's OK to harbor a blood-thirsty vampire that has killed 11 totally innocent blue collar workers and then 10 friendly and gentle young adults because the depraved vampire will make my family prosperous and prestigious again. A 10-year old boy with no super powers can unchain a vampire, but a vampire with super powers is totally helpless. A ghost can destroy an all-powerful witch but a shotgun, a vampire and a werewolf are totally useless! It's OK to create another blood thirsty vampire because you are in love and the person blackmails you!<br /><br />The main message of Dark Shadows is that's it's OK to kill in order to have wealth, power and prestige. The ends justify the means! How sickening!<br /><br />Dark Shadows is so bad I have made a pact with myself! Despite how much I love sitting among a live audience, I will refrain from going to the movies until the The Hobbit is released at the end of the year. I hate wasting my time, money and emotional energy on films that do nothing but exploits the audience with drivel, and ends up being nothing more than boring, tedious trash!

1439127700|5.0|As a life long history buff, I was looking forward to reading this book.  It is a very interesting look at a part of modern presidential history that has often been overlooked.  I thought the book very readable and well researched.  Entertaining for the history lover or a casual reader.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really didn't expect to like this book!  I read it in less than 24hrs.  I just couldn't put it down.  I am no beginner to romance novels, but this was was less romance and more delving into how people are the way they are.  How 2 people that are so different end up needing each other and revealing intimate secrets about their past.  I loved it and can't wait to see what happens in the next book!
0345803485|2.0|i don't understand the hype for this book. I picked it up 2 weeks ago to read. I am still reading. I am 88% percent through and if I don't finish I wouldn't care. I usually pick up a book and don't stop reading till done. The e-mails in the book are just so pointless and boring. The many orgasms unbelievable. The rolling eyes and biting lips get old real quick. I would have finished long ago if they hadn't repeated everything so often. All I can say is someone has done a good PR job.
B0063GORYU|5.0|try it you will become addicted to the game. challenge yourself and don't give up. I've. been playing this for years.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app love it. I use this app to help me try and get a handle on my bills and it works great.
0061726834|3.0|This is one of those books that I was super hyped to read.  I had waited so long to get it from the library, that I almost didn't believe it when I got it.  But sadly, after all the excitement and the building up I was ready for, it didn't live up.  I felt like the pacing was bad.  Their relationship was really rushed in the beginning, especially for how they could both be killed for it.  A lot was good.  A lot was not explained and confusing.  It was very Romeo and Juliet.  All love story and very little subplot.  If you want a mad love story, go for it.  I will read the rest of the series.  I don't think I would recommend it to any of my book critic friends.  Make what you want of that and have fun.  If you choose to read it, enjoy; if you don't enjoy whatever book it is you choose and let me know what it is!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. simple but fun. the kids have a ball. free is awesome. easy to download. hours of fun. great time killer as well.
B005PK1G76|4.0|This Diono organizer is easy to set up and use it! I took it up when I fold my Maclaren tech stroller just in case for not letting the organizer get twice, but I just found out that I don't even need to take it out because it don't bother to fold with it.
B0058SNI94|5.0|Love these and want them in every color.  I can slip them on, wear them to the dog park (or anywhere), and then wash them in the sink.
B005LCYR7Y|4.0|Steven King gives and he takes away. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I almost didn't want it to finish.  The characters were almost real. The story isn't original but it's a bloody good adventure with twist and pike. I knew he was going to blind-side me. He did. I figured out how it was going to end. I was wrong. Beaut end.<br />I'm always searching for characters from other King novels. It's like looking for the Alfred Hitchcock cameo. Again he didn't disappoint. Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.<br />Good book.
B000AOEMXM|3.0|When will the studios figure out we don't want elaborate DVD/Bluray packaging.  We want simple, consistent, easy to access packaging.  Not irregular shaped, hard to access, overpriced packaging.  This series has some of the worst packaging I've seen.  Whoever designed it an green lit its production should be fired.<br /><br />And this is yet another grossly overpriced Paramount product.  Dear Paramount.  Simplify and cost reduce your Star Trek series packaging, cut your price in half, and your volumes will double and you will kill the pirated DVD market.  Wake up!<br /><br />That being said, fun series.  Way better than the ratings indicated.<br /><br />Packaging - 1 star<br />Content - 3.5-4 stars<br />Average (as a sold packaged product) - 3 stars...I just can't get by this disaster of packaging!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|I recently purchased a Macbook Pro (Late 2011), which comes with firewire 800 (9-pin). I thought a 4-pin (400 firewire) to 9-pin (800 firewire) cable would suffice so I can capture and log my digital video from my XH-A1 and GL2 (both are by Canon) to my new Macbook Pro, but a cable with those two ends will not work. You will need an adaptor and I purchased this adaptor to solve this problem.<br /><br />Once the adaptor is plugged into your traditional camera with a firewire 400 cable using this adaptor to your new macbook pro, it will work instantly for all your capturing needs again<br /><br />Camera > 4-pin firewire (400) to 6-pin firewire (400) cable > 6-pin (400) to 9-pin (800) adaptor > 9-pin macbook pro input.
0143121006|5.0|Previous reviewers have summarized the book, so just a note to say that the book is a fascinating glimpse of China at a time when its very existence was in question and how the murder of a young lady became suppressed by various powers who felt threatened by the case being investigated and eventually lost in the tumolt of war and revolution.<br /><br />The book builds layer by layer -- just when you think a likely suspect is in sight, the author develops other lines that point elsewhere.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the 'where are they now' section at the book's end.<br /><br />A tiny quibble -- I think the book would have been better if pinyin was used instead of Wade-Giles.  I know why the author chose it, but even providing the pinyin in parenthesis after a city's or name's first usage would have been helpful.  I'm reasonably fluent in Chinese, but reading Wade-Giles was a chore.<br /><br />A huge gold star for the map inside the book's cover -- I'd love to have it poster size to put on my office wall.  Kudos to the artist.
B00008QSA5|5.0|Excellent audio quality, even on desktop PC speakers with sub-woofer.  Bloomfield, we miss ya.  You and Stevie Ray were taken from us way too soon.
B003QCCS36|4.0|The kind of \\"country\\" I like.  Melodically pleasing and you listen to the story.  With that said.....it does not equal the brilliance on<br />\\"When the Sun Turns Black\\".
0345803493|5.0|Loved the first book, but the second is even steamier!  This series is so good I couldn't put it down and lost a lot of sleep.  The bond that grows between Ana and Christian as he reveals his past is the type of relationship we would all love to strive for.
B000GPIPVU|5.0|The first \\"album\\" and/or cd that I have loved every song.  When I received it, I listened to the complete cd three times.  It takes you away somewhere very pleasant.
0345803507|5.0|Book three is not as steamy as the other two because the relationship is growing so much.  It was still a great read of unconditional love and being cherished.  I was left bereft when the book was done because you just want to keep reading!
0345803485|2.0|With all the hype about this book I decided to download it to my kindle. It is one of the worse books I have ever read,totally unbelievable, repetitive with absolutely no depth. I told my friend who ordered the trilogy to not waste her money and cancel the order.
0345803485|5.0|Everybody I work with was talking about it, so I had to buy the books and see what all the fuss was.  I have never been so engrossed in a book as with these.  They catch you within a few pages and keep you tantalized until the end.  I never wanted to put it down, and couldn't wait to get back to reading to see what would happen next!
B007L96VCY|5.0|No need to review what a great recording this is. If you are interested in a remaster, then you already know. I love the way the remaster sounds. Well balanced, full and true to the original. NOT a LOUDNESS WAR remaster. The subtleties in the music are lovingly rendered and the bottom end is fat and punchy. The Beatles folks really understand how to remaster a record. Kind of wish the original mono version had been included in the two CD set, but that's why they get you for the more expensive version.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I ordered this book by Robert Kiyosaki to my Kindle book and am loving it. I have owned it before in paperback but really liking the kindle
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a movie like Midnight in Paris in quiet awhile.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story line and how it took us back in history.  That was a surprise I never expected.  Loved Owen Wilson's acting, he was perfect for the part. I was transported to the beautiful city of Paris and all it's wonderful sites.  I totally recommend it!
0060558121|1.0|I don't understand the good reviews this book has received ! it's a total mystery for me. It was one of the worst books I've ever read !<br />The characters are flat and not interesting. All this \\"old gods vs new gods\\" conflict is ridiculous. The book is full of clich&eacute;s on mythology and America (I cannot stand this always condescending british tone and point of view about America anymore).<br />And, worst of all, it's boring ! the story doesn't catch up, it's slow, the action almost non existent (the characters spend their time in moving from a place to another).<br />600 painful and pointless pages... Gaiman should stick to comics for teenagers...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book captured my attention right away. The two main characters were funny and very entertaining. I love Christian and his many shades of Grey.I hope the author will continue writing about these two.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've always loved solitaire and I hadn't found an app for my kindle yet that had satisfied me. Fun, free, and entertaining, it can keep me busy whenever I'm bored!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Okay, so....I heard so much about Fifty Shades, I downloaded the preview on my Kindle. I was annoyed with her in the first chapter, then decided to keep reading and after the preview was over, I found myself buying the book. There...so, I am reading these reviews that are completely hilarious and I have to agree with most of them.<br /><br />The book made time go by rather quickly, and if I had quit reading halfway thru the first book, I think I would have been left somewhat inquisitive as to how they navigated their relationship....IF I had put it down...I didn't. Wish I did. I don't think anyone has ever met anyone like Ana or Christian because they don't exist. This is like a mad twist of The Bold and the Beautiful and 9 1/2 weeks with lots of staring and sex with steam- from the bathroom. Ana and her freaking inner goddess became quite annoying- it seemed like her inner goddess wanted to turn this into a threesome, but I was sick and tired of Ana three quarters of the way thru this book anyway. Her character seems to be a proud, pure and responsible woman that has been put under the spell of the gorgeous billionaire that happens to be into an alternative lifestyle that not many people speak of openly. THAT lifestyle I think is the draw of the audience and the only reason this book has sold as it has. It certainly was not from the content or the constant circle of repetition that occurs in the book. As I read it, I felt more sorry for Christian. He seemed to be quite up front and honest about his expectations and for some reason- Ana thought this must have been some sort of phase that he would snap out of...with her help. Please. The only realistic part of this book is the fact that some people, no matter how honest you can be with someone, still seem to think they can be changed. It drove me crazy while reading. They will only change if they want to, and THAT'S IT! I do not wish to endure 1300 pages in two more books of indecision to come to that realization, as apparently she finally does -it has to end somehow, right?<br /><br />One was enough for me.apparently she finally does -it has to end somehow, right?<br /><br />One was enough for me.
B0067R0APK|4.0|use all the time.  I find this to be more accurate than the competion especially the update on radar and the update on the weather service of severe weather.
0545265355|5.0|These books are amazing! Once you start to read them you can't put them down. They're an easy read. If you're looking for books with action seek no more.
B007BVOEPI|2.0|First off, Game of Thrones is a phenomenal series.  I am watching Season 2 on AFN,and I have been reading the series since the first book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I ordered the regular resolution Season 1 from Amazon.  My slow network connection dropped the connection time and time again.  I never did download Season 1 from Amazon and have a really frustrating time figuring out how to drill down to where it is stored in my account.  Just too complicated.<br /><br />I also do not currently have a Windows computer with HD.<br /><br />I do have an iPad 2, an iPhone 3GS, and iPhone 4s and a MAC i5.  I went to iTunes, bought the HD version and let it download until it was finished. Then i watched it on the MAC.  I have it on my iPad 2 and can watch it on my Sony HD LCD TV with the HD connectors for the iPad 2.<br /><br />I have been working with Microsoft systems since Bill Gates built the first DOS for IBM.  Today I am retired and live with a very slow connection that Adobe and other vendors hijack regularly that locks up my poor, slow netbook and drops connections frequently.<br /><br />If you have a fast broadband and a Sandy Bridge it will not be a problem, but I do not.  What I have learned is that Apple can handle slow connections without frequent interruptions.  Until Amazon and Microsoft can do that I will buy my video from iTunes.<br /><br />I do buy all my books on Kindle.  I read them on my Apple products, but I purchase ALL my books on Kindle.  It is getting pretty confusing where I am supposed to keep them.<br /><br />I quit buying my music from Amazon after I had a catastrophic failure of my Alienware laptop (the reason I do not have an HD Windows box).  I tried to download all the music I have bought from Amazon over the years, but it is not possible and according to the Amazon Customer Service Representative I contacted it was my responsibility to keep backups for my music.  It was not Amazon's.  Let me think.... I was overseas protecting my fellow Americans at the time 6,000 miles away from my backups.  I suppose I was not even eligible to download the halfway around the world.  No more Amazon tunes, either.<br /><br />Would you like to know what I really think?<br /><br />Thanks for Kindle books though, Amazon!!
B007NZDES0|5.0|Sade is a master at what she does; and the band all respect and love each other. They are all extremely accomplished musicians; all gifted in the ways of music. That's one of the things that interest me. Never have there been a band consisting of eight male members and one female (rephrase that to a Goddess); and never have they ran into any problems. Their a family, and that's the best way to be a band. I've never witnessed that before and I think that it's an extremely beautiful thing; especially knowing that they split the money the band makes equally between them.<br /><br /> Their the most gifted and honorable group of people I've ever seen. I've been to the concert three times ( Yes three) because, the lyrics and the music stretch your mind and calm your soul; the music is powerful and spiritual. I already bought my copy yesterday, for me it was a \\"MUST BUY\\"; Sade would be a great teacher for this younger generation of artists; most artists of today have lost passion and meaning. BUY THE DVD NOW PEOPLE, and learn what a \\"TRUE ARTIST\\" & what truly great musicians are. Move over Lady Gaga, Beyonce, and Rihanna; salute the Royal Queen and her Noble Knights of Music Royalty.
B0081JAED0|5.0|All too often it seems that bands get back together after many years apart and produce albums that are soulless and boring.  This is not one of them.  Not Your Kind of People is solid.  Garbage have managed to come back and produce and album that still sounds very Garbage-y while evolving their sound.  If you're a Garbage fan, or if you aren't a fan yet, this is a no-brainer purchase.
B00007BKVC|5.0|This is a DVD purchased for my mother, who is very plesased to have it.  It arrived safely and in a very timely  manner.

0425166805|5.0|In my personal opinion anyone who criticizes this man's work is just another fish looking for an answer. I give him great credit for actually sticking to his assumptions. I do agree he does tend to jump from conclusion to conclusion making your mind wander, but is that necessarily a bad thing? When reading this book I realized that there is more that meets the eye of any machine, whether it be us, or an xbox, dvd player, etc. He also is just another person wanting people to be interested in his work, and his ideas. Growing up your basically told what to do, how to do it, and why to do it. This book gives you a glimsp on how to entrepreneur, not just your job life, but your mind. I might also be looking to far into it, however those are my thoughts on his book. I reccommend it, not just as a great book, but excellent ambition to try and find something besides textbook schiza.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love this game. It's so addictive. It is my three year old daughter's favorite app. Would definately recommend this game.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. Makes me think.  I am still early in the game, but it is getting harder.
B007HJB6OG|5.0|I've been wondering up until now if it would be worth my time to continue into the second season of this series.  This season finale answered that question.  YES!  Great surprise ending :D
B007IXWKUK|2.0|I purchased all three in this trilogy.  My husband is grateful I'm finished because I complained loudly the entire time I was reading.  I found the sex scenes monotonous and skipped over them after awhile.  Got frustrated with repeated phrases/words such as Inner Goddess, \\"Oh,\\" fisted my hands through his hair, etc.  SPOILER ALERT:  I could not get past the fact that Christian was \\"introduced\\" to this sexual lifestyle by his mother's friend at the age of 15.  That is sexual abuse any way you cut it, and it ruined the sex part for me.  The other thing that bothered me was when Christian explained to Anna that he wanted \\"vanilla\\" sex, she turned around and asked for rough sex.  To me, it was like an alcoholic asking for support in not drinking and your partner says \\"but I want a few drinks; have a few with me.\\"  He wasn't completely sure he could stop himself without hurting her.  Yet, there she goes and asks for it.  At that point, I wanted him to beat the hell out of her.  (I am not sure at what point in the series this occurred)  Even though I took issue with those two points, I admit that I immediately rushed to start books two and three.  I got caught up in the storyline of Christian and Anna, wanting to know if they ended up together and how their lives progressed.  It irks me that the publishers won't allow you to lend the book to one person. So much money is saved with digital publishing, yet the end consumer doesn't realize any of the cost savings.  Their greed will catch up with them.
1455508977|5.0|Book: The Lucky One<br />Author: Nicholas Sparks<br />Published: 2008<br />Genre: Romantic, Drama<br /><br />Synopsis: After the U.S. Marine, Logan Thibault, finds a photograph of a young woman, he begins having good luck. His best friend, Victor, had told him that his streak of good fortune came from the photo that he had found. It was his lucky charm. After serving his duty in Iraq, he came back to Colorado and he couldn't get her off of his mind. So he traveled across the country to find her in North Carolina. He just wanted to tell her about the luck he has with the picture. But when he finds her, he falls in love and keeps the photo a secret. As he and Elizabeth start a passionate love affair, Logan's secret threatens to ruin their relationship and so does her ex-husband, Keith Clayton. This destroys not only their love but also their lives.<br />Nicholas Sparks delivers a stunning story about a man whose brushes with death leads him to the love of his life. The Lucky One does a great job of taking The Notebook and Dear John to another level of drama, romance, and suspense. The Lucky One is an unforgettable story about the surprising paths our lives take and the power of fate can have on true and everlasting love. Not every book can tell a story so true about human nature like this one.<br /><br />Book Rating: 10
B007JM4CWY|5.0|tremendous game.  can be challenging if your not used to this type of challenge. app works great.  probably better on bigger screens, but is very manageable on phone screens.
142311339X|5.0|My 10 year old niece is crazy about this series. It is amazing how this book traps the attention of the young readers. Fast paced and with good action, this is definitely worth a read. I would suggest this book for all the young readers out there.
B0083GQKQG|1.0|I thought this film would have a bit more action and maybe cause me to think about Kevin. Instead I was forced to stare at the main actresses miserable face during the majority of the film. I found myself having to constantly ask myself \\" Where is this going and when in the world is it gonna get there\\" The film goes on forever and is a major snooze fest.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Great FAOTD for puzzlers. Started out easy but got difficult really quick! I don't pay for apps, so I'm glad this was free.
B006CHML4I|5.0|Very good watch, very happy with it. Exactly as advertised. I wear it at work in a warehouse, no problems. Seems to be rugged enough.

B00005N6KG|4.0|It is summer again and time to hit gym. I needed new pair of headphones that cheap and comfortable. I just these today and must say it meets expectations. I wasn't for in for high sound quality but sound is good enough for workout. I am using Windows Phone HTC HD7S which has SRS Sound Enchancement that significantly improves bass and overall definition of sound. With that these headphones are quite impressive then. Otherwise I use big Koss around ear headphones which are comfortable and high sound quality.<br /><br />For less than 10 bucks, this Sony headphones is totally worth for workout such running, jogging and so on.
B000JML90Y|4.0|It is remarkable how much Darwin got right given the very limited amount of information available in his day.  What also struck me was that (unlike the IDiots), Darwin was very humble about the limits of his knowledge of the subject about which he probably knew more than anyone else alive at the time.  I found myself skipping over the rather tedious lists of supporting detailed evidence he presents for his ideas and instead read the chapter summaries in detail.  His arguments anticipate and clearly refute every one of the arguments put forward by the Creationists at the time.  It is disheartening that these same tired, defeated arguments (irreducible complexity, failure to grasp the implications of deep time, failure to grasp fundamental statistical concepts, etc) are still being pushed today by religious fanatics of all stripes in their irrational attempts to subvert the teaching of biological science and substitute religious dogma for it.  If religious dogma is allowed to substitute itself for science courses at the high school level, we will find ourselves back in the dark ages, with totally unaccountable \\"god ordained\\" leaders chosen for their ability to regurgitate dogma while completely unable to grasp the complexities which absolutely must be dealt with if our technological civilization is to continue to function.
B000JJSPXQ|3.0|This collection was merely a way to include new mediocre songs, at the expense of two key hits. They are \\"Queen of Rain\\" and \\"Church of your Heart\\". Surely there was room! I can't really recommend this collection for that reason alone!
B007MAETA8|5.0|John Mayer has said that he will not remain stagnant in his music, and he has kept that promise.  Born and Raised is yet another side and genre from a musical genius, who seems to have no limit to his talent.  Personally, that is one of the things I love about him, he doesn't stick to a popular formula and just run with it, as many in this business do. Born and Raised comes about after a two year hiatus from the fall-out from two disasterous interviews, and the songs incorporate the lessons learned from the experience. In an age of meaningless lyrics, his words are so beautiful as to bring tears to the eye.  I love the entire album, each song is amazing.  John seems in a happier place, and the music shows it.  Even though this is not a guitar \\"god\\" album, the music is as flawless as ever, with excellent harmonies from David Crosby and Graham Nash, and Chris Botti is on here, too.  Another perfect surprise from John.
B0072IVGZG|4.0|As a long time Cultist, a fan  who owns all the bands albums and box sets, including all the Instant Live Recordings from about a half a decade back (I know, you're happy for me), I feel I can speak with some authority as well as write a excellent run on sentence.  COW is an obvious return to form when you compare it to the last \\"pink\\" release, I forgot the name, in which Billy Duffy was sonically MIA, Ian sounded winded, the songs were well below par for the band and most importantly it did not respect \\"The Rock\\".<br />Personally, I may hear more of a rebirth, reincarnation or regeneration having listened to COW about 5 times over now (and listening at a reasonably loud volume, through real speakers. The Cult are not an earbud, mp3 player band).  The songs, their sound, the mix, the lyrics and the entire vibe of the album seems to incorporate everything the band has ever done...including the early Death Cult albums.  COW for me, moves the band to an entirely new level...more mature & less pretentious while still being able to rock out and have something important to say. So, if you are a Cult fan, this album is pretty much a done deal (I got mine at Best Buy yesterday for $9.99 and it is the 2 disc version).  I rate it 4th in the same tier as \\"Electric\\", \\"Love\\" and \\"Sonic Temple\\". Because I have a tendency to listen with my \\"Electric\\" tinted glasses, I rate COW at 4.5 stars instead of 5.  If you are more of a \\"Love\\" person, then it may rate a 5. 'Nuff said on that point if you really know this band. For new fans, this is really an excellent place to start.  \\"Place to start\\" is a phrase very few older rock bands can boast on their current releases.  After spending a few weeks digesting this release, you can move back in time to the 3 albums mentioned previously.<br />And last of all with no disrespect to Jamie or Matt, this is the best rhythm section the band has ever had.<br />So either add to cart or head over to Best Buy before they close up for good!<br />****Car experience update - Having listened on my Bose computer speakers for the first half a dozen or so listens, I did not realize how \\"loud\\" this recording is.  In loud I mean sonically challenged, similar to Metallica's \\"Death Magnetic\\".  I have read the dynamic range on this recording is very low and some have used the term \\"brickwalled\\".  I really needed to turn the volume down in my car considerably and found my ears a bit \\"pissed off\\" after about 20 minutes of listening.  Again, no slam on the music, just the overall \\"listening experience\\".  I am interested to read if anyone else has noticed this or has any thoughts.....rock on!****

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I've read the entire series and LOVED them all - each more than the one before!  These books build such engrossing charachters that you just can't wait to read more and literally can't stop reading.  I read 17 chapters the first day I got it.  The evolution of both Christian and Ana throughout the series is intriguing and exciting - I really hope she gives us more books!  Yes, they are a little graphic - but these are meant for adults to read - and if you are embarassed or squeamish about sexual content, then don't read them.  For the majority of adults - it is a fantastic searies you will love.  I'm actually going to read them again - something I haven't done in YEARS!  Two thumbs up over my head!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Get ready for a heart-pounding adventure and some sleepless nights! This novel was very well written, and it's been a while since I've stayed up into the wee hours of the morning to finish a book! This book has it all: non stop action, a story line that sucks you in and makes you THINK, and characters that you can't help rooting for. I highly recommend this book!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have read this book many times and it was falling apart.  What a find that I could get it on the kindle.<br />Have just reread it again and it was as good as the first time.
B007Z9QS5K|5.0|I just saw this movie as a middle-of-the-night-and-no-one-else-is-up movie choice. I will probably watch it again!  Yes it was a bit cheesy, but I loved it just the same. If you are having a bad night and just need a little pick up where the good guys win, then this is for you.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|The ending to this was great, the whole idea that science and religion are driven towards the same goal using different means to achieve the same end, good stuff.<br /><br />HOWEVER, holy s*** the first and second acts are slow. Do we really need to see the Giant A-hole walking around sucking up credit for everything? Did we really need to see Gary Busey's son as a psycho cult leader and the whole destruction of the first device when a second one was readily avaliable? It felt like pointless filler padding out a strong story into an overly long drag, if I was in charge of editing Contact I'd probably take out about an hour of filler.<br /><br />Anyways underneath all the forced drama lies a really good story that sci-fi fans and religious people can both enjoy.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|I got this game as free app of a day.<br />It worked with Galaxy Tab (2.2), but soon I found it does not work (it simply quits) with Galaxy Nexus (4.0), Galaxy Tab Plus (3.2), and Nexus S (2.3).<br />You are warned.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|The actors look as uninterested in this as I was watching it. Really I'm probably putting more effort into this review than the film makers went into writing this junk.<br /><br />I think the appeal to this film though is when people say some 'in' joke, the 'cool' kids started liking this so the lemmings in grade school followed suit going &#34;HAHAHA, LIGER! I GET IT! DO YOU GET IT!? BECAUSE I DO&#34;! Some films have a quirky charm to them such as Little Miss Sunshine or Lost in Translation, but this whole movie is nothing but spouting off random non-sequitors that somehow stick with high school kids who's senses of humor is still underdeveloped.<br /><br />I can see years from now those kids going through their DVD collections and fishing out Napolean Dynamite and muttering to themselves &#34;I can't believe I watched this crap&#34;.<br /><br />Edit: I take back everything I said about Napoleon Dynamite, what with 400 copies being pawned off for $0.01 & how everyone involved in this movie's career have really picked up since 2005; Truly a timeless cinematic achievement.
B007MAETA8|5.0|Touching my heart right from the start, this work is raw, honest and flat out beautiful. It will be the soundtrack in the background of my life for quite awhile. Bravo John Mayer!
1455508969|4.0|Absolutely loved and enjoyed reading this book, it is a great love story. I became so addicted to reading it that i finished it in 3 days! I initially bought the book because i wanted to read it before i watched the movie, and i must say that the book was 100 times better than the movie! Another Nicholas Sparks classic!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is really fantastic. Not only does it allow you to look up and highlight verses, it will also play them for you and even gives you access to many multiple versions of the Bible so you can use your favorite. So many great features. The only drawback I've seen is that it requires wifi access, but most places these days have wifi available so it's not that big an issue.
B00785P2QC|5.0|love this game. I would deft recommend this to other buyers. free rein in free games is great<br />. love it. really
B007JM4CWY|5.0|If you like Sudoku and crossword puzzles you'll love this game! It's a great thinking game that can keep you entertained for hours. I've been playing it for the last 45 minutes and love it! It's pretty hard, but worth the effort. Here's what I love about it:<br /><br />-Tons of levels: It's divided into 8 individual levels, with up to 37 boards per level. They get really hard as it goes on. It lists the difficulty of each level (easy, normal, advanced or expert)<br /><br />-Pinch: Pinch to zoom makes it easier on smaller screens to hit the cell you're trying to hit<br /><br />-Ability to jump ahead. You can start at level one or jump ahead to any level you want. You don't have to beat the previous levels to move on.<br /><br />-Tutorial: Great tutorial that helps a lot as this is a complex and sort of confusing game.<br /><br />-Interface: Easy to use menu and settings for music on or off. You can also set it to display time and battery in the upper left hand corner of the board. It's nice to be able to monitor battery life, especially with phones with large screens that drain your battery fast.<br /><br />I also want to note that if you're having problems learning the game, do a Google search on \\"nonogram\\" and you'll find additional help. The tutorial in game is good, but some sites (like Wikipedia) have great solution techniques to help you!
0062124293|4.0|As the other reviewers all agree this book is funny and shocking from go.  The author swears and is at times vulgar, but it's all charmingly laugh out loud funny if you're in the proper mood for a good chuckle.<br /><br />Written with a true comedian spirit, some content gets lost in translation even though she's British and they speak Enlgish remember that it is an entirely different culture.<br /><br />This is less a manual and more Moran's perpective and observances about all things that make us women and what we as women go through.  She explores the vajayjay in ways that most women don't share with their closest girlfriends or sisters, but it's very amusing as long as you're not easily offended.<br /><br />Overall, it was a fun read that I would recommend to my lady friends who were in need of a good laugh.
1609613937|5.0|This is an extraordinary book. It's well researched and well written and shows us how we can make simple changes to create lasting health. The messages we hear everyday are just wrong; we DO need carbohydrates, AND they are the key to health, says McDougall. The diseases that are rampant can be prevented and reversed but you will not get the information you need from the USDA or the food industry. This is the place to get the best current information about the foods that keep us healthy and reverse western diseases. Potatoes and starches are not bad for us. I remember reading a book about the Okinawan diet and it was way back in the references in tiny little print that it said that up to 95% of calories were from sweet potatoes (the Okinawans live very long lives and stay healthy). We definitely need carbohydrates and they are the foundation and the key to health. Inspiring, tremendously brave, and heart felt, I cannot say enough good things about this book and the McDougalls. A 'must read' for anyone ready to take their health back into their own hands.<br /><br />A note about tofu: I don't at all agree with the concerns about soy that circulate these days and are hinted at again in this book. I believe that some beef and dairy lobby groups (presenting themselves as nutrition experts) have put out a lot of incorrect information about soy. I don't know why they do this. Maybe they want to attack the competition. Or maybe they want to divert attention from how unhealthy their own products are. But there is no convincing evidence that soy is bad (although isolated nutrients can be a problem). Soy is researched extensively due to the amazing variety of phytochemicals in in that can treat and prevent disease. It can actually reverse gene-silencing! And Okinawans do eat tofu (traditionally) and more of it than other Japanese. Although minor concerns are presented, no harm is done, as the recipe section does have some recipes with tofu, thankfully.
0545265355|5.0|I've just started the series but I find it hard to put the book down. I thought it was just me experiencing the weird font changes that were screwing with my eyes. I had to keep adjusting the size after various chapters. I immediately liked Katniss, and enjoyed her gentle side when it came to Prim and Rue.  Her tolerance of Peeta is humorous as she realizes that she needs to continue to play the game to stay alive.  I wanted to see the movie but after reading the reviews that people who did not read the book did not quite get the movie I opted to read the trilogy and see the movie after; then I'll have something to compare it to.  The book is well written. The author paints a very clear picture of each scene.  For example, you can almost see the hunger and despair many people in District 12 are facing. I can imagine Katniss escaping the district into the woods each day. The opulence of the Capitol reminds me of what third world countries must think of Americans in the United States. Are we glossy, hairless, and is our lifestyle laughable too? Hmmm... likely so. I can't wait to find out what happens next.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I like this one. works well. no glitches. and I don't why you have to have 20 freaking words to give a review.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|This book was a very pleasant surprise.  Extremely well-written story of a young warrior.  The depth of the characters was astonishing, the story grabbed me and wouldn't let go.  I wanted to keep reading but will have to wait til the next book is out.  I very highly recommend this book.  Just one request to the author - please be careful with \\"rein\\" and \\"reign\\"; \\"reign\\" was misused a lot for \\"rein\\" - just a very minor notation.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This series is a decent adaptation from the book, doing an excellent job of preserving as many details as possible.  Caters to lovers of many generes: social politics, action, drama, fantasy...and very good acting too.  The only complaints I've ever heard about it is the added sex scenes.  I, personally, love this series and have already watched is front to back twice.  The added commentary and content is pretty neat too.  Soooo looking forward to the next season!  Highly recommend the books as well.
B006CHML4I|1.0|Never never never ever buy Seiko Men's Automatic Watches, because SWI group will not provide you warranty they will give very hard time to claim in warranty and also they have pretty bad customer services. My wrist watch is there and I am still waiting for warranty recovery, they charged $10/- for shipping and handling which is not suppose to charge because of under warranty, but they did it. Since 4/9/2012 I did NOT receive this watch back. I will never recommend to buy this watch to my American peoples.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I consider myself an informed reader.  That's why I was interested in this latest best seller that is breaking all kinds of records.  It's about a dominant-submission relationship.<br /><br />Amanda is a young college graduate who interviews a powerful and young male entrepreneur  for her college newspaper.  She's immediately smitten with his good looks and his outrageous wealth.  Eventually, he deflowers her and she falls in love with him.  Thus begins a complex relationship between them, told through the young woman's eyes.  Slowly, the reader is swept up in the narrative and the rather lightweight bondage scenes.<br /><br />I found this book a tedious read and will not read the next two books of the series.  There is too much  introspection by the young woman, long self-reflective parts where she contemplates the relationship and romantic  activity, including bondage, which is supposed to be titillating.  Frankly, I found it all quite boring and the only reason I finished the book is because I wanted to be able to write a honest review.<br /><br />Naturally, I'm glad I read the book just to see what makes this kind of best seller.  But for me, personally, it was a waste of time and I cannot possible recommend it.  However, because there was some sort of logic to the story and it was clearly written with a well-developed story line I stop short of giving it my very lowest rating.
B0043GAZYS|4.0|I loved this movie when it came out in theaters, and I still love it now. It's snappy dialogue, outrageous visuals, and surprisingly well-choreographed action all made it my favorite summer movie of 2010, despite the fact that almost no one here in the US saw it. There are a few issues with pacing in the middle of the movie, but overall it's just pure zany fun.<br /><br />The Blu Ray edition has lots of great extras on it, including some really interesting commentary tracks, and all in all the set is worth the price, whether you already love the film or are just discovering it for the first time.<br /><br />All that said, I was very disappointed in the video transfer on the BD. This movie screams to have a top notch transfer, with eye-popping FX and a vibrant color palette. Sadly, the colors are muted, and the image isn't nearly as sharp as it could be. Honestly I didn't notice any difference between the visuals on the BD and the TV broadcast version, which is a real disappointment.<br /><br />The audio transfer, it should be noted, is quite good, so no worries there. But the ho-hum picture almost had me knocking this amazing movie down to 3 stars.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This was a very well done movie and it followed the book writing very well.<br />The item was received very fast and in good condition.
B007L96VCY|3.0|This is an excellent remaster of what is perhaps Sir Paul's best solo album. Sounds great, Punchy and great to have some extras. Why Only 3 stars? I would have easily given this 5, but deducted two stars because the Eighties mix version here of \\"A Love for You\\" is probably the worst possible version of one of Macca's best unreleased songs. I've definitely heard better version of this song on scratchy bootlegs and things, and it would have been nice to get a cleaned up recording. It wouldn't be so bad, but this version (which if I understand correctly was remixed in the Eighties) has updated, more modern, (and frankly less dynamic and more boring) drum sound), and it even sounds like the vocal track is new, which is dissappointing, his vocals swoop and soar in the original. Compared to the original vocals, his voice on this mix sounds flat and tired. I don't know, I guess the obviously modern drum sound doesn't really gel with the rest of the material, and frankly, this was the unreleased track I was most looking forward to.<br />  Other than that minor complaint, (Well, not really Minor, I was really looking forward to that one), this would otherwise be a five star review. Fortunatly, the other extras a pretty good, \\"Oh Woman, Oh Why\\" is a minor Classic that could have been a single on its own instead of being relegated to a b-side, and \\"Little Woman Love\\" is almost as good. This really is some of Pauls most underrated work, and easily, the most solid album of his career. It's surprising that the critics trashed it at the time of it's release.  Band On the Run certainly has a couple songs that top most of these, but track for track, this is the most consistently good album he ever recorded.

B000EXZI1O|5.0|Got to kind of feel for these guys who had to close out the 70's riding high on the overwhelming success of [[ASIN:B000SQFC0Y Saturday Night Fever]]. Suddenly they went from huge to SUPER huge! The end result is they followed this up with another self produced studio album a year and a half later that seems to have gone on to become the bands biggest seller of the decade. One reason for that is pretty clear-their hits were on the radio and in discos everywhere during this time. And because they were the cream of the crop in terms of pop songwriting their high potential for longevity made them idea for long term radio success as well. In the end the setup was about the same as their previous full length studio album: ten songs and a big dance number to start out with. One thing that's to be noticed is the Barry takes about 90% of the vocal leads on this album. His distinctive falsetto became one of the key signatures of the band around this time so they put it to heavy use. But there's something else here as well.<br /><br />  With \\"Tragedy\\",their hit that's most obviously aimed at discos it's apparent what made this album so successful. The production and sound is as glossy and sleek as fiberglass with a coat of red varnish. Basically that means the sound also has this burning fire in it too. Songs such as the pop-funk grooves of \\"Love You Inside Out\\" and \\"Search,Find\\" showcase this on the funkier end of things. There's actually somewhat more ballads on here than is typical for Bee Gee's of this era such as \\"Too Much Heaven\\",\\"Reaching Out\\" and the lightly percussive and folksy title song fitting into that category. \\"Stop (Think Again)\\" is a big orchestrated epic that's something of a modernized take of their orchestral pop/rock sound of the late 60's. \\"Living Together\\" and \\"I'm Satisfied\\" are a bit different than the rest of the music here. These are the two deepest,sparer bass/guitar type funk on an album defined by it's slickness. Robin only gets about 2 1/2 minutes to shine here at the end on \\"Until\\",an amazingly soulful and even jazzy exploration with these warbly,abstract synthesizers.<br /><br />  Following this album the Bee Gee's would change direction during the anti disco freeze out in the early 80's to a full on pop/rock oriented sound. This sadly wouldn't prove very successful for them commercially and it wouldn't be until later in the decade that they'd re-emerge with a sound that could work more successfully for them and their audience. Even still there would always be a little something missing that really only appeared again here. Yes to a point they did get rather typecast with the sound of this era and the pop world never seemed to let go of that. It's sad because with the production,songwriting,vocal and general musical talent these guys possessed I can only imagine what sort of great thing's they'd continued to have come up with if their success wasn't derailed by changing musical tastes and a failed movie experience most people are very familiar with. At any rate this particular album found the Bee Gees still at the top of their form. And in a way at the end of their peak period.es to shine here at the end on \\"Until\\",an amazingly soulful and even jazzy exploration with these warbly,abstract synthesizers.<br /><br />  Following this album the Bee Gee's would change direction during the anti disco freeze out in the early 80's to a full on pop/rock oriented sound.

0439023521|4.0|There is something infectious about the short, declaratory sentences that open the Hunger Games.  Perhaps it is the indication made so early on and so tacitly that Panem is not a place for deep reflection, a land where long-winded soliloquies are wholly inapproriate and out of place.  Whatever the attraction, this is one of those rare books that snags you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the very end.  It may be impossible to say anything different from what hundreds have already said.  Quite simply put, this is a great book and deserves to be read.<br /><br />The author, Suzanne Collins, does a phenomenal job in crafting a world that is at once engaging, brutal, and terrifyingly possible.  It isn't that the book is so fresh and original that one cannot help but be spellbound, indeed much of what the Hunger Games brings to the table can be found, bit by bit, in other literary works or in films.  That these various elements don't feel trite, however, is a great credit to how wonderfully put together they are.  If the narrative is interesting, I don't particularly care that there may be another book that is somewhat like this one, the book stands on its own two feet and in my estimation is more than original and creative enough.  Arguably one of the author's best decisions was to maintain a fairly rapid pace throughout the novel which kept moments or bits of plot from becoming old too quickly with perhaps a few stumbles here and there (the part where Katniss and Peeta are sitting in a cave comes to mind).<br /><br />Katniss is a good main character and I found it hard not to like her as the protagonist, though at times she seems a little dense which is at odds with 98% of what the book reveals about her.  She's a smart and savvy hunter and can discern the intent behind a sponsor's gift but can't figure out that Peeta isn't lying about his feelings for her.  It makes no sense and is perhaps the only example where the author missed a great opportunity to make her, and that part of the narrative, more three-dimensional and gripping.<br /><br />Of course, the book is \\"brutal\\" insofar as it goes.  I didn't find it to be overly graphic and unlike some others I don't believe in the slightest that the book glorifies or romanticizes violence as there are several instances where characters decry what's going on and express indignation about what they're being forced to do.  The thing to villify is not the PG-13 violence, but the hypothetical governmental forces that not only allow the killing, but compel it to happen.  Those who would see in the book an endorsement of meaningless violence are those that I don't think have really read the book.  You won't receive anything on the order of Golding's Lord of the Flies, but it will force you to ask a meaningful question here and there.  While the book purports to explore the effects of war and violence on those coming of age, it seems that the planned trilogy took precedence and so, maybe, that exploration will be truly started with the second book which might be appropriate since the first one needed to introduce the world and, as I said, it isn't yet one that invites much reflection or philosophizing.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games is a dynamic book that, with a few notable missteps, does a great job in whisking the reader away.  It can be forgiven for being somewhat derivative, if you choose to look at it that way, but it stands as an excellent achievement.  It might not be a true classic but it does leave you hungry for more.
B000EXZI0K|5.0|During the time this album came out I am sure many people aimed as many \\"disco sucks\\" style epithets directly at Barry,Robin and Morris Gibb for \\"going disco\\". Well for one,at the time just about any dance oriented music without a loud guitar was considered disco music. For another it's important to remember that the Bee Gees were a pop band. And that means that their style of music would change often. But their basic handling of melody and vocal harmonies would remain essentially the same. On their previous album [[ASIN:B0063TX06I Main Course]] they recovered from a commercial dry spell with a wonderful,soulful and hit filled album produced by Arif Mardin. He wasn't able to be here so the Bee Gee's decided to do what Hall & Oates would do half a decade later: produce themselves into the charts. The Gibb's certainly had enough musical experience by this time to make self production work for them. And with their new found sense of direction they took their self contained band and delivered an album that I feel is one of if not their strongest overall release.<br /><br />  \\"You Should Be Dancing\\" starts off the album with that heavy,funk fueled afro latin fueled dance track probably indelibly associated with [[ASIN:B000SQFC0Y Saturday Night Fever]] but this is where it originally comes from. Another great part of this album is that it's packed full of undebatable funk such as the sleek sophistifunk of \\"You Stepped Into My Life\\" and the out and out Sly Stone inspired horn funk of \\"Lovers\\" and \\"Boogie Child\\". The latter two songs feature the growling,Boz Scagg's style vocals of Robin and serve as an important reminder Barry's falsetto wasn't the only vocal on Bee Gee records of this era. The band channel Thom Bell style Philly balladry perfectly on \\"Love So Right\\" with Barry's Russell Tompkins like falsetto topping off the creamy music and \\"Love Me\\" and \\"The Way It Was\\" mark the best of their pure pop ballad style. \\"Can't Keep A Good Man Down\\" and \\"Subway\\" showcase a Philly influence though again more in a dance frame of mind. One of the best songs it actually the closing title track,a nice message song starting with a near acappella vocal harmony and diving into a moog bass tinged pop/funk jam with a wonderful melody.<br /><br />  On this album the Bee Gees actually managed to put together the sort of album you can play from beginning to end with no weak tunes. From soul ballads,to funk to grooving pop/R&B this album contains it all. And it actually makes you wonder with it's rich,creamy sonics why the Bee Gees hadn't been self producing their records a lot more. Apparently they'd been taking everything that had been done with previous producers right in and adapting that to help their own inevitable experience when the time arose. Today disco no longer seems to carry the stigma that it used to. As a matter of fact,a lot of people (I am sure including a number of former Bee Gees detractors) have come to realize that the majority of the music on this particular album wasn't aimed at disco dancers at all. 1976 was a very good year in general for soul,funk and R&B. Even the blue eyed variety. If you lined up the works of EWF,Stevie Wonder,P-Funk as well as Boz Scaggs and David Bowie from this era and saw the creative and commercial quality of the music you'd be dealing with...well it's right there for all to see. And I am happy to say the Bee Gee's can add this particular album to that legacy from that year.illy influence though again more in a dance frame of mind.

I don't like the grainy paper look on the puzzle -- it just ends up looking fuzzy on my Galaxy Nexus.

Other things aside, I'd give the game a 4-star rating.<br /><br />Why does this game need the permission to open network sockets?

B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Okay, first things first.  I LOVE the 21 Jump Street series.  At first when I heard it was announced, I thought to myself, 'A comedy?  And the cast includes Channing Tatum and Rob Riggle?  THIS MUST BE STOPPED!'.  And so I was against it for months.<br />Then, the first trailer came out.  Had some funny-looking scenes, but what really got me was the red-band trailer.  I guess it's an acquired taste, but I love the vulgar humor style of Jonah Hill, and I was cracking up at the trailer.  At that point I went from being totally  against the movie to counting down the days til it came out.<br />When the good reviews came rolling in, I got a bit worried.  Only because, I usually hate movies that everyone says \\"Oh, it's so great, you must see it!\\".  Case in point: Anchorman, Avatar, the Hangover.  All got rave reviews, and I hated them all.<br />But opening day came, and when I left the theater afterward, I was not disappointed.  Actually, I was sure it was the most fun I'd had at the movies since I can't remember when.  The laughs started early and never let up.  And though the main focus is comedy, the action scenes don't disappoint, though it never stops making you laugh.  And, surprisingly, Channing Tatum was actually really funny.  At one point you even start to feel bad for his character -  something I never thought I would find myself saying.  I loved it so much that I went back and saw it three times in theaters.  And you can bet that I'll be pre-ordering the blu-ray, and it will become a mainstay in my movie collection, and sit proudly next to the 21 Jump Street TV series.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I love my Vanilla book club! We had too much fun last night discussing Shades of Grey. I'm sure we acted like 7th graders in our adult bodies. We had the range of reactions from, \\"Oh please, I didn't even finish the book\\" to \\"bring me a fan. I need to cool off\\".<br /><br />I want to remind all of us, not just the naïve, uneducated and ill-informed that... this is FICTION. This is not how people who are controlling usually behave. This is a \\"nicey-nice\\" or \\"harlequin romance\\" style of plot. S&M and being controlled in reality rarely, if ever, leaves you whole (or alive). Even her \\"issues\\" ... sadness, hurt and disappointment never brings her to despair. Totally, totally a sugar coated work of fiction for the S & M trade genre.<br /><br />That being said,lots of explicit sex, F I E L D T R I P (goota check out what he stuff really looks like)!!!
0345803485|1.0|This is the most poorly written book I have read in years. The author's writing style is just not a style I find enjoyable to read, nor did I find the story interesting.  Every page was predictable.  I purchased the trilogy. I read 5 chapters into 50 Shades of Gray trying to give it a chance as the ratings were so favorable.  I could not read anymore.  I was bored from page one.  I returned all three books - a first for me.
B00773YOB4|5.0|It's Bonnie Raitt. How could it not be good. Another quality product and great songs by this fabulous redhead. love it.
0061091480|5.0|YEZ is my favorite book of all time. It is an effective and efficient psychological karate course. I have been turning people on to Wayne's books for 30 years. I have met him in person and even managed to get on TV by attending one of his PBS specials. He is a great public speaker and a wonderful comedian as well. This book addresses and improves personal feelings, thoughts, and emotions. Over the years he has evolved into an extremely popular \\"new age\\" communicator and explorer. He is deserving of the Nobel Peace Prize and is as much of a guru as one will find in the western world. Who are his peers? Tony Robbins? Deepak Chopra? Susy Orman? Certainly. But to my way of thinking, Wayne is the greatest of the great. A splendid spirit indeed!!!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this app is great but the only flaw is that you have to press settings to get the menu bar to get out of the app other than that I love it.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Well you should buy it.Its good like all the story games.Just don't buy if you have no Internet connection.but it is great
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I played the game and it was okay at first. I had everything I wanted that my land could hold. But I checked on my land to see how long it was untill I could collect money from my buisnessess. The longest buisness I had was 12 hours. I was shocked to find that it glitches and I now had to wait 3 days!
B007ZCQJOM|4.0|This album has a much bigger sound than any of their previous albums. Like many, my first introduction to Beach House was Teen Dream, which took a while for me to \\"get\\". Now it is one of my favorite albums - it gets a 10/10 for me. With Bloom, it took me a little less time to grasp, but like with all their other albums, the music isn't exactly immediate. Beach House's music has a very heavy, hypnotizing effect so it takes a few listens to notice the nuances and layers. I found that Bloom is very much a continuation of where they left off with Teen Dream. Generally, I prefer the sound on Teen Dream, but I like what they did on this album in terms of the direction they took with the sound.<br /><br />\\"Wishes\\" is an immediate standout for me, especially with Alex Scally's wonderful guitar break in the middle of the song. \\"Other People,\\" which Beach House has performed while touring for Teen Dream, has a nostalgic sound to it. The chord progressions on it are heartbreakingly lovely, quite like \\"Silver Soul.\\" \\"Myth\\" is also an instant winner - it shares some very similar characteristics with \\"Zebra\\" (including the key), but it is faster and has more sounds in the background. \\"Troublemaker\\" and \\"On the Sea\\" are lovely songs - they form the softer side of the album. \\"On the Sea\\" is to Bloom what \\"Real Love\\" is to Teen Dream.<br /><br />Songs like \\"The Hours,\\" \\"Wild\\" and \\"Irene\\" took me longer to get into. I really like how Victoria does the vocals on \\"The Hours\\" - the way she slides one note to the next while singing the same syllable. I did find the ending of the song a little anticlimactic though. \\"Wild,\\" which for me is the most experimental-sounding song on the record, has easily the biggest-sounding drums of all the songs, but more than that, when the melody grabs you on the line \\"wild in our ways\\" you're basically hooked. \\"Irene\\" is like a slow-burn cousin of \\"10 Mile Stereo\\" with an intense build-up at the end.<br /><br />\\"Lazuli\\" is probably the most progressive song of the record, though it's still very accessible and simple. This song has lots of layers and there's some vocal looping at the end which is very beautiful. \\"New Year\\" is, for me, the weakest song on this album. It's a little too predictable - but I enjoyed the slide effects on the guitar.<br /><br />And for fans of their older stuff, the hidden track at the end of \\"Irene\\" sounds like a leftover track from their first album, with a vintage drum machine sound.<br /><br />I wish Beach House had done something a little different, to surprise us a little bit more. I felt that the songwriting could have been supported with better, even bigger-sounding arrangements, especially with the drums. This is one area where I feel like their attempt to hold on to a classic Beach House sound kind of holds them back a little. Perhaps they wanted to try to sound bigger but still retain a certain tone of intimacy and, I guess, familiarity. Regardless, I definitely enjoyed this album. I have no doubt they'll keep putting out great releases in the future.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This was my first app downloaded to my Kindle Fire.  It was qick and very easy. The graphics are colorful and I like the auto complettion feature.  I recommend this app for anyone who likes a speedy game of solitaire.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I've read alot of the reviews and though I do understand the comments about the repetitiveness, I still thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Some say that this book doesn't make any sense, it's too \\"unreal\\".  That a teenager wrote it based off some fantasy they were having.  Come on folks, it's not meant to be REAL.  If I wanted real, I wouldn't read.  Is that not what they teach us in school, \\"Books can take you places you've never been\\".  Well I can honestly say I've never been down this road before.  As for the repeats, I don't know, is it not part of that character's personality.  I wasn't fond of all of it, that's why I give it a 4 and not a 5.  I liked the biting of the lip, the rolling of the eyes, I do it myself, why can't they?  I found it funny that he was calling her out on it.  My favorite parts of the book and why I give it a 4....THE EMAILS.  I absolutely loved them.  I tried so hard not to laugh (or smile) when I was reading them in public.  My kids or my husband would ask me why I was smiling.  My husband has that kind of personality.  He's always had a smart mouth, and can think of something quick to say at the drop of a hat. I only wish I were more like that.  \\"I'm going to have to start writing better emails\\".
B000URWYTS|3.0|It is no surprise that Nancy Horan chose to author a book centered upon Frank Lloyd Wright as he lived and worked in Oak Park, IL where she lived most of her life.  Ms. Horan obviously researched her book thoroughly as it is chocked full of facts about Mr. Wright and his lover, Mamah Borthwick, Wright's architectural styles, and Borthwick's women's movement activities. The abrupt ending to the book was appropriate considering the real events in Borthwick's life.<br /><br />The problem with the book is that Horan does not delve deeply enough into any one subject or conflict because she is too concerned about inserting factual information.  The book needed better editing,Horan should have been guided to increase the information about Borthwick's relationship with her husband, family, friends and Wright.  In fact, the passion between Wright and Borthwick that was so great it caused them to defy society was not evidenced in the writing. As this is a work of fiction based on the lives of these individuals, she could easily have amended this flaw.<br /><br />The book was still enjoyable to read; but only if rented or received as a gift.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|My wife and I both loved this movie. I think the name was the kiss of Death for it in the box office 'though. They should have fired the guy who named the movie.<br />This is definitely a movie worth buying on Blu-Ray.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|I saw this game in the app store a couple of weeks ago.  I'd recently gotten hooked on nonograms and downloaded two full versions of FlipPix.  I wanted this, too, but couldn't justify the $5 price tag.<br /><br />Now I'm glad I waited.  This game is great for people who like logic and math puzzles.  I love nonograms.  But this app has a few functionality issues for me.  Number one is that you have to tap each and every square to select it.  In FlipPix, you can swipe through the entire row of squares to select them all at once.<br /><br />The other major issue with this app is that you have to continually resize the screen.  Pinch and push to make the screen larger, otherwise you end up selecting the wrong squares.  Pinch and smash to see the numbers, otherwise you will be constantly scrolling around between swards and numbers.  It can get confusing, even for someone who has played nonos before.<br /><br />Lastly, I hate that you double-tap a square to &quot;X&quot; it.  That means if you accidentally hit a square twice, it will be marked out and if you don't catch the mistake it can be hard to solve the puzzle.<br /><br />Overall, I think FlipPix is a much better investment (unless, of course you get this one today as the FAOTD).
B003LQMZS0|5.0|I love how this toy is unlike many of the others you see more frequently of this type.  It really caught my 4month old's attention.  What's great about it is there are bright bold colours and patterns to appeal to all ages but also that black and white print which seems to appeal to younger babies.  It also has a small mirror dangling from one foot which she loves to stare at and grab. The texture of the plastic is also great for her to touch.  It feels very much like a quality product.
B003Y5H59C|4.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies.  It gets mixed reviews, from the critics and from viewers and buyers.  It was ahead of its time just for shining a flashlight on some taboo topics.  People looking for typical Hollywood glitz and glamour or eye-popping special effects will be disappointed.  People looking for a sweaty, leather-clad S&M film with some dialogue thrown in just to help it pass as a movie...those people will be disappointed.  People looking for a movie that's different in its honesty and humanity will appreciate it.  It's a love story that skips all the drippy sweet gorgeous-guy-meets-perfect-girl; they don't immediately fall madly in fairy tale love and run off amid a shower of bird seed and ribbons to begin their perfect vanilla life together.  They don't engage in goofy, tripped-and-fell-into-my-dream-date sitcom antics that saturate your average romantic comedy.  Their mutual \\"interest\\" doesn't turn into a seedy, uncomfortable B-movie.  The film does a great job of casting off the entire dark image, and the sleazy stereotypes, and just telling a story about two people trying really hard to feel normal.  It's a lot less about sex, and a lot more about people just trying to be okay.  Under the sexual surface, it actually broaches some deep subjects shrouded in enough light humor that the realness doesn't weigh you down.<br /><br />I've seen people characterize Spader's performance as \\"deadpan,\\" \\"flat\\" and \\"emotionless,\\" and criticize the movie for being slow and boring.  The man is playing an attorney, at work, in his law firm. Spader gives a great performance as a man torn between what he feels and what's acceptable. His \\"flat\\" affect is his character's forced act that he's just an average guy having an average day at the office. He's trying to appear professional, aloof, and disinterested--deadpan and emotionless--like he's supposed to.  Maggie's character is equally trying to her best to be accepted and convince the world she's normal--not just some nut job fresh out of the psych ward.  I've seen people rail against this portrayal of a creepy pervert taking advantage of a young psych patient, but that's not what happens here.  The point is she's not crazy--and neither is he.  They each have their own way of dealing, coping, and feeling, just like everyone else.  She watched daddy drink and mom get slapped around, and she coped by cutting.  Her dad's way of dealing-by-drinking is no better, and certainly not healthy, but since it's also not wierd or morbid it's accepted.  Of course it's not okay for Lee to cut herself, or for Mr. Grey to spank total strangers for making typos--suppressed feelings almost always manifest themselves in inappropriate behaviors. Once these two find each other, and start expressing instead of supressing themselves as part of a consensual adult relationship, the inappropriate coping mechanisms stop and they finally become the \\"normal\\" people they've been pretending to be all along. He goes to the office like an average guy, she settles into being the average housewife, and they do their thing at home where it's completely appropriate.  No more cutting, no more changing secretaries like underwear...they're healthy, they're happy, and they didn't even need rehab.  Once he can stop pretending, Spader's \\"flat, deadpan\\" persona gives way to feeling and passion--even tenderness-- but thankfully without the sappy, mushy, \\"romance\\" typical of most love stories. This movie is deeper than a \\"dark comedy,\\" and way more relatable than a fairy-tale romance.  It's truer and cleaner than the S&M flick some people were hoping for.  If you're looking for a B&D guy movie, you'll have to look elsewhere.  If you're looking for the usual hearts-and-flowers chick-flick, this isn't it. If you want a break from the ordinary and a love story that's not so sweet it hurts your teeth, this delivers. It's not a film for everyone, but people who don't enjoy the lifestyle can still enjoy the movie andmay even end up getting ideas.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I had gotten used to viewing these movies (especially the first movie) on standard DVD. Alien looked grainy and just plain terrible. I expected this considering the age of the movie. Alien in this transfer looks visually as though it was filmed recently...the quality of the video transfer to Blu-ray is that good. Whomever handled the transfer to Blu-ray should be applauded for the work. Unlike transfer like Star Wars (4-6) to Blu-ray which is of very poor quality, this is worth the purchase at even the $100 retail price.<br /><br />Buy the set, it is well worth it at the sub-$50 price I paid!<br /><br />EDIT: The price is down to $30 so don't hesitate to buy this set.
B007JM4CWY|2.0|The puzzle might be the greatest, but the tutorial required to understand gameplay lacks clarity. I love grid puzzles, but I shouldn't have to puzzle out this game's instructions. Do a better job there and then I could better evaluate the app.
B007NZDES0|2.0|I hate when they do this.  If you want the blu ray, you cant get the the excluisive WalMart disc unless you buy the DVD version.  This is why I take every chance to get everything I can for free - record companies are dirty marketing tricksters.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is the best nothing is better than this game I never stop playing it. you should get it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game! It is the best game I have downloaded for my kindle fire. That being said I just wanted to list a few problems and the ways I have found to fix them.<br /><br />First I would like to comment on the time shift. It is a big problem within the game. No one wants to play a game when all of the sudden things that take a min to produce takes 400+ hours. What I have done is to sell and then buy the property. Also when the time does run out the property will reset with the standard time for production.<br /><br />The one way I have found to stop this from happening all together is to trick the kindle into forcing the game to shut down. To do this you must put your kindle in stand by as soon as you notice it has froze. It will go frozen to stand by turn back on stand by again then turn it back on. When you turn it on the final time it will say there was an error and that the Oregon trail must be forced close. After you click ok you will be brought back to your home and you can get right back into the game with no glitches.<br /><br />One thing you can do is to shut down your kindle completely when you notice the game is running sluggish. The only problem with that is the energy will not refill when the kindle is completely shut down.<br /><br />Another thing I want to comment on is the energy. Most people complany that there is not enouph energy. Yes it can be a problem and 3 min. can be a long time. Even at Max energy you only get 50. My advise is to be smart about what you do. Don't be in a rush to build things that are not need yet. Doing this can get you later. Sometimes the game will not register that a building already exist. It would be an even bigger waste to have to rebuild.<br /><br />I love this game. I am at level 75 and loving it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|reminds me of the original kinda mixed with harvest moon . have to manage your energy wisely you cant do squat

B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an exciting continuation in the trilogy! Fifty more shades of Christian in technicolor and he does not disappoint. Things get wild and juicy and \\"teeth clenchingly good\\" -- you won't be able to put this one down. This book really gets into the nitty gritty and there is plenty of action throughout to keep you coming back for more. Enjoy!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Works great! My son and I play together. Have no problems with this app. Its been fun and I don't have to spend money on if I don't want too.
B00782O7IY|5.0|My first ideas about The Artist were that it was a re-hash of A Star is Born but I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the marvelous performances. The performances by Jean Dujardin, as silent movie star George Valentin, is a tour-de-force and magnificently conveys all the emotions of his fall from stardom.<br /><br />The film begins in 1927 when Valentin (modeled after Douglas Fairbanks) is at the top of his profession. He has a chance meeting with (and is attracted to) a young dancer and would-be actress, beautifully played by Bérénice Bejo. As it was for many stars of silent films, Valentin has problems adapting to sound movies. At the time, sound was considered a fad by many but audiences proved such ideas a fallacy, forcing studios to switch to sound as fast as possible. Valentin bucks the trend by making an expensive silent film that bombs at the box office while the actress he had previously befriended is starring in a blockbuster under the name Peppy Miller. The film chronicles the rise of Peppy Miller's star as Valentin fades into oblivion, helped by the Great Depression.<br /><br />I have had a long affection for silent films so it came as a nice surprise that The Artist was filmed using the same size film that produces a square box on the screen. The cinematography (by Guillaume Schiffman) was also reminiscent of silent film and was tones of the film were superbly rendered. Interesting that a small clip from Fairbanks' Mark Of Zorro was included in the scene where Valentin is watching one of his movies. John Goodman was fabulous as movie mogul Al Zimmer and James Cromwell was terrific as Clifton, Valentin's supportive chauffer. It was also fun to see Malcolm McDowell in a bit part. And lest we forget, Uggie the dog certainly made the movie special and charming.<br /><br />Much credit for the success of the film goes to Michel Hazanavicius, who took quite a chance of making a silent film. The period of the 1920's and 30's was beautifully broght to life. I hope that The Artist places more focus on silent films, as they are beautiful works of art even if sometimes the acting is old-fashioned.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book!  Very hot, but also great story line! I would definitely recommend this to my friends. I have the other two in the triology and loved them as well!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice way to kill time on my Galaxy Note. Would have been a 5 star except it DOES NOT CLOSE ON EXIT and I have to go into Task Manager to end it (no excuse for that). On my Note, I can just barely make out the numbers on the cards, so I think only those with excellent eyesight would be happy on a smaller screen since there is no zoom capability and the cards are a bit small.<br /><br />If you have a Note or larger screen, then I DO rec this app. I like that there's a choice between random draw and winning draws (after several frustrating random deals, you'll appreciate this one). I like that I can set it for wifi only access. Since I don't begrudge the developers making money on this free app, I like that there is only one ad screen per draw, and if you play enough in one session, there aren't any ads at all.<br /><br />UPDATE 05/26/2012: Received an update on the app and now the cards are easier to see. Instead of the standard card face, there's now one single large suit icon with a larger number typeface. For example, instead of the six of hearts showing six hearts with a small numeral 6 in the corners, there's now one large heart with the numeral six in a much larger typeface. 100% easier to see so I upgraded to 4 stars.<br /><br />The app now SOMETIMES closes on exit. So still needs improvement there. And I've received a couple of video ads which, if they continue, will have me downgrading my rating again. Video ads are dealbreakers for me.
0743486285|5.0|This is the real deal.  I can't wait to pick up the book every evening to read more of his journal entries.  Very interesting, and disturbing at the sametime.  This is a great piece of Nikki's life that he let's us all into.
B000002JSN|5.0|Favorite zeppelin cd and one of my favorite cds of all time. there is soo much variety in this cd its hard not to dig it. all the multi layered tracks with the multi layered instruments is the bomb listening to with a nice pair of headphones. for 1975 or 76 its pretty damn complicated for its time. and of course jimmy brings out the riffs on every song. god bless that man. pick this one up along with zeppelin 2. my two personal favorites. while your at it too, pick up some black sabbath albums with ozzy...the first 6. cant go wrong with zeppelin and sabbath. no sir. have a good day guys. wait hold up. i forgot to say this is one of the best doulbe albums of all time. right up there with the wall,white album, andmellon collee and the infidint sadness.
0307949486|3.0|Who was this Stieg Larsson?  Well, Stieg died of a heart attack after walking up a flight of stairs back in '04.  Too many cigarettes, too much coffee, not enough sleep and little or no exercise I guess.  Kind of like his lead character in the book.  I began the book thinking I would not like it but I got hooked.  I enjoyed the setting in Sweden, some of the characters, and the plot.  Not bad for a first book.  Is it a first book?  I could have done w/o all the stats on abused women.  Mr Larsson seems to have had the soul of a woman.  No macho in him at all.  Salander, the 24 yr old anti-social misfit, is a criminal hacker but she does have a strong survival instinct.  I don't really get the tattoos, the piercings, the attitude, the darkness, the alienation.  I'm not sure a young woman like her would actually care for her mother or take the time to visit her.  Could be wrong.  Why is it that corporations, the church, the rich are always bad?  The rich invest their money so that corporations like Apple can make laptops for hackers like Salander.  The churches feed a lot of misfits like Salander.  Oh well, it is a pretty good story.  It really ended for me when B found Harriet.  Give the book a shot.
B000002H6C|5.0|and justice for all straight up slams. the record is angry, sophisticated and full of riffs. i bought this cd when i was 12 in 6th grade and i still enjoy it as much as i did eleven years ago. this is my second favorite metallica cd behind the classic of all classic heavy metal ablums, master of puppets. my favorite track on the record is the title track. straight up punishing. if you like metallica, go pick up some black sabbath or pantera. long live true heavy metal.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Benchmarks aren't everything.  This processor is being used for producing film scores.  With an orchestral template using 75 tracks, 10-12 GB RAM usage, and multiple VST's with different convolution reverb at the same time, this proc doesn't even blink.  I also haven't experienced the \\"vacuum cleaner\\" fan noise that others have, even under heavy load with the stock cooler.  I also play games (most recently Diablo III) and they are as fast and smooth as anyone could ask for.  Perhaps if you're looking for top-of-the-line, this isn't it for sheer speed, but for handling multiple intense workloads at once, it's fantastic.  For the price I couldn't be happier.
B005NQ94KS|1.0|This movie was so awful I felt compelled to warn others off of it.  Hathaway's accent is cringingly embarrassing and distracting.  Patricia Clarkson is a fine, lovely actress, but again the accent is horrific.  Are there no British actresses?  Other reviewers have covered all the defects of this film in better and more detail than I will here.  Suffice it to say it's boring, tedious, and silly. The characters have zero chemistry, no charisma, or any true redeeming qualities. I didn't care whatsoever that Hathaway's character died.  By the end of this travesty, I wanted to run them all over myself.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|\\"Sherlock\\"'s first season was an impressive update of the 19th century technology-and-deduction-obsessed detective to the era of internet and cell phones. Season 2 is even better. Season 1 was evidently conceived as 60-minute episodes that were expanded to 90 minutes with a lot of useless filler. The characters and situations were great, but the stories were sloppy, to the point of cringe-inducing at times. Writers Stephen Moffat and Mark Gatiss knew what format they were writing for this time, so they gives us enough meat to fill 90 minutes. I didn't feel that these episodes dragged or went off course at any time. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Final Problem\\", and novel \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" have been updated to \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\", \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\", and \\"The Reichenbach Fall.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\" is the weakest of this trio, but Mark Gatiss has, to his credit, updated a story about a giant, glowing dog so it makes sense to a 21st century audience. And modern concerns about secret military experiments are a nice touch. \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" updates a fan favorite and does not disappoint. Scenes are often framed through windows or doors. \\"The Richenbach Fall\\" is the cliffhanger that left Holmes fans anxious in 1893. It looks like modern fans may also have a long wait to find out if there will be more. But fame in the modern world is very different than Victorian England. Watson's blog has made Holmes an \\"internet phenomenon\\". \\"The press will turn, Sherlock. They always turn. And they'll turn on you,\\" says Watson. Comments on modern journalism and paranoia about computer crimes are some of the updated themes. The episodes are:<br /><br />Holmes may have met his match in \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\". He and Watson are whisked off to Buckingham Palace in the middle of a case by big brother Mycroft (Mark Gatiss). Some illustrious person in the government wants Holmes to locate some compromising photographs in the possession of a dominatrix named Irene Adler (Laura Pulver). Adler anticipates Holmes' involvement in the case and befuddles him at first. But a group of well-armed, ruthless Americans are also after the photos. Or is their interest in something else entirely? Adler's life seems to be in danger, and Holmes is unusually protective. But who is playing whom, and why? This is a clever episode with plenty of twists and turns, but making it hinge on a 4-character password that any computer could crack is beyond ridiculous.<br /><br />Holmes and Watson take on the seemingly supernatural in \\"The Hounds of Baskerville\\". Desperate for a case and a cigarette, Holmes listens to the tale of Henry Knight (Russell Tovey), who, as a young boy, witnessed an enormous dog kill his father on the moor near the town of Baskerville. Twenty years later, the giant hound on the moor is something of a legend among local conspiracy theorists, who believe it is related to animal experimentation done at a nearby top secret military base. Holmes sees a possible connection to a seemingly trivial case of a lost rabbit, so he and Watson are off to Baskerville, where big brother Mycroft sends DI Lestrade (Rupert Graves) to keep an eye on them. This story is still eccentric, but the writers have come up with a solution to the mystery of the demonic, glowing hound that is believable to a modern audience.<br /><br />Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) shows just how dangerous a nemesis he is \\"The Riechenbach Fall\\". He breaks into the vault containing the Crown Jewels at the Tower of London, the vault of the Bank of England, and Pentonville Prison simultaneously, apparently using some very clever lines of computer code. But why? He didn't steal anything. He has the British government, including Mycroft Holmes, terrified of him, and even Sherlock is perplexed and trepidatious. Moriarty says something about \\"a final problem\\" and promises, \\"It's gonna start very soon, Sherlock. The Fall\\". Moriartyis obviously insane, but that may mean that Sherlock Holmes won't be able to keep up with his brilliant but irrational mind. Unpredictable, fast-paced, with stabs at modern journalism, ego, and gullibility, this episode keeps the audience guessing and entertained.is obviously insane, but that may mean that Sherlock Holmes won't be able to keep up with his brilliant but irrational mind.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Let me start by saying that I have been a Stephen King fan since Danny Glick scratched at Mark Petrie's window all those years ago and he is still my favorite living writer.  That being said, I didn't give this one 5 stars.<br /><br />I agree with the reviewers that have stated that this book would be better if a couple hundred pages were trimmed off. Stephen King is a flat out brilliant writer, but this one just dragged for me. Too much information and too many sub-stories.  Just my opinion and that is why I went for 4 stars.  It was still good enough to get 4 stars because when it wasn't dragging, the novel was spell-binding, particularly the first and last third.<br /><br />One jarring note for me which may not have bothered others--as a long time resident of Dallas I find his treatment of Dallas and his professed dislike of our city to be perplexing and very unfair. Dallas Derry....Derry Dallas. Seriously? Oh of course I know what his point was. He has explained it himself numerous times that he blames the political and racial climate of Dallas for the Kennedy assassination, just as he blames the current Right Wing politics for recent violent acts. He said as much when I saw him speak here in Dallas last year.  He is certainly entitled to his opinion. Mine is that \\"crazy is as crazy does\\"---people who attempt to or succeed in killing public figures (political or celebrities like John Lennon) do so to gain attention for themselves and Oswald is no exception.  I didn't take away a point for this because like I said, it is a matter of opinion and he is certainly entitled to his.<br /><br />All that being said, Stephen King is the storyteller of our/my generation.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|If you liked Mulholland Drive you'll like Shutter Island. Just remember the central character in both films can't bear the burden of guilt from a crime that each one committed. They only recognize the truth through the efforts of an alter ego. In this case the prison's medical staff decides to try a drug treatment rather than a lobotomy on a patient. Marshall Teddy Daniels arrives after the patient disappears from Shutter Island and slowly discovers the truth. He is the patient and now remembers why he was sent to the hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island. At the time lobotomies were still quite common and drug treatments were only making an appearance. Dr.Cawley has been impressed with the results and quite pleased that in this case Teddy remembers that he is really Andrew Laeddis but he worries that he'll regress once more to Teddy and send him for a lobotomy. Well, Andrew Laeddis does apparently regress to Teddy Daniels and on his way for his lobotomy he remarks, \\"one can live as a monster or die as a good man\\". He would rather regress from his true self and live as Marshall Teddy Daniels than deal with the memories of Andrew Laeddis on Shutter Island. The medical staff may have failed with Andrew Laeddis but did Teddy Daniels escape? After what happened Andrew Laeddis wanted nothing to do with himself and found escape from his past in the role of Marshall Teddy Daniels. Somebody he really wanted to be. Like Mulholland Drive, Shutter Island is a thriller but both films are downright strange. There are no heros or heroines in these films only protagonists and they are dark, bizarre tales. One film concerns a woman who can't escape the past. Another film concerns a man who may have done so. Are Teddy's regressions involuntary or voluntary? Is it really a failure of the drug treatment or a choice for a lobotomy by Andrew Laeddis who just can't handle the past?? What's frightening is the past that they are trying to escape and the audience discovers with Teddy Daniels over the course of the film. I liked Mulholland Drive more than Shutter Island.th Teddy Daniels over the course of the film. I liked Mulholland Drive more than Shutter Island.

B005B0QYMM|1.0|Ok, as a start, the first 45 minutes were probably the most boring of any terror movie I could've ever watched. But the worst came after.<br /><br />Grave Encounters does not offer any intense moment, or original idea, and even touches the silly and non-sense of its story.<br /><br />Rec2 (the Spanish version) is a great example of what a false documentary movie should be.

1466401885|4.0|After reading a very steamy & quite popular romance trilogy, I was desperately searching for my next good read.  This book definitely came through for me!  Great read... read it in just over 1 day... and was sad that it went by so quickly.  Very intense love story...which is what I am drawn to.  Some graphic content is in this, so be warned of that, but overall a GREAT read!

B000JML7YC|4.0|eBook downloaded from Gutenberg. Catherine Morland's visit to Bath is enlivened by friendship with the shallow Thorpes and the fascinating Tilneys. Invited to accompany Miss Tilney to their ancient home, Northanger Abbey, Catherine expects to wander crumbling, mysterious halls but finds a modern, comfortable residence. The dictatorial General is the fly in the ointment, oppressing Catherine as well as both of his children.<br /><br />This is an early Austen and it shows. Austen's oddly cynical attitude permeates this unusual tale, frequently contrasting what is actually happening with what would usually happen in a novel. The story is disjointed and wraps up in a hurry, as if she had run out of paper suddenly. But the portrayals of both innocent and calculating characters are dead-on, as only Austen can manage.
B008133JZG|5.0|If you enjoyed the sheer creative quirkiness of Season 1 of SHERLOCK, the innovation continues. There is no formula for these shows. The surprise continues to surprise. In Season 2, three classic Sherlock stories are updated and tweaked to fit modern times.<br /><br />1. A Scandal in Belgravia, 2. The Hounds of Baskerville and 3. The Reichenbach Fall are the three stories brought to life and color. In A Scandal in Belgravia, the dominatrix Irene Adler is introduced. Is she the perfect woman for Sherlock? Will her feminine wiles beguile him and make him lose his senses and mind? Loved the ending in this one. There is an adult theme, with the cracking of Adler's whip, so remove small children and animals from the room.<br /><br />In The Hounds of the Baskerville, Sherlock's most famous mystery, the plot is really toyed with. This one is the most terrifying of the three stories. Finally, The Reichenbach Fall, Sherlock meets Moriarty head on in mind-to-mind combat. Who will triumph? The ending will have you brainstorming different hypotheses for what really happened, how did they do that, and what will happen next, making you wistful regarding having to wait a year to find out. I wonder if we'll see Moriarty in Season III...<br /><br />Really, the writers/producers need to produce more shows each season. Three are not enough. How about five or seven shows, as in DOWNTON ABBEY? You can still have a little quantity without sacrificing quality.<br /><br />This second series makes you like this enactment of Dr. Watson even more and Sherlock seems to be softening, becoming more vulnerable emotionally and humane, before your very eyes. Or is it an act? Season Three will tell. We can't wait!
B006UAWH2S|5.0|Of all the movies that I have viewed this year, this one has to be up there with the best, especially as far as intensely intriguing. The amazing direction of David Mackenzie, the suspense filled screenplay written by Kim Fupz Aakeson, the lulling and mournful soundtrack by Max Richter and the shock and awe photography of Giles Nuttgens (both beautiful and distressing combined) pull a metaphorical statement from beginning to end.<br /><br />Michael (Ewan McGregor) is an executive chef who meets Susan (Eva Green), a forlorn epidemiologist after she returns home from examining a patient with a very disturbing affliction.  Inexplicable, as he suddenly lost his sense of smell for no apparent reason.  This continues on to several other people at first then runs vastly amok.<br /><br />These two begin an intimate relationship quite rapidly, as everything in this movie happens quickly and without warning with one exception; each person will fall into a severe emotional occurrence prior to losing their ability to smell.<br /><br />Susan and her team rapidly give it the name 'Severe Olfactory Syndrome' (SOS, an interesting acronym) as it reaches epidemic proportions and spreads worldwide.  There are no explanations given as there is no time, therefore one must think on their own of how, why or what is happening.  The movie heavily affects your time in reacting.  It causes suspenseful anxiety to build readily and rapidly as you are left questioning the reasons of how could this be?<br /><br />The erotic relationship between Michael and Susan hardly gets a chance to develop, as the rapid-fire affliction follows into another sense (taste) and similarly eradicates it.  Michael is 'affected' and this is devastating to his career as has Susan affected also.  The couple is growing more and more dependent on each other as the happenings around them are mercurial and deconstructing.<br /><br />The symptoms preceding the loss of the senses are bewildering, wonder-struck and deeply disturbing.  People are losing control, panicking and literally start unstoppable eating of anything and everything (from lipstick to things you have got to see for yourself).  The photography and camera angles get increasingly confusing and more disturbing while bringing this chaos to life; it is all out catastrophic. People are running wild, rioting in the streets as everything is unsafe and sickness is omnipresent.  There is so much to this movie that I wouldn't want to go on with the plot any longer as I would hate to ruin anyone's response to this movie...and your reaction in itself is everything.<br /><br />Running amid the course of the film are short plugged-in narratives that work well.  They serve to make you think, as this is a frightening portrait of annihilation in a very different form.<br /><br />When someone loses one of his or her senses, it is usually just that one and devastating enough alone.  The ending of this movie presents a whole alternative view to this, as tomorrow is no guarantee and &#34;gather ye rosebuds while ye may&#34;.turbing.

1439170916|5.0|I've been looking forward to reading this for some time, and I recently completed it.  The first hundred pages or so of the hardcover edition was hard for me to finish.  This wasn't because of any deficiency in the writing.  It was simply because the writer spent a lot of time humanizing the subject with cases from his residency and in the \\"early years\\" of cancer treatment (in the 19th and 20th centuries).  As one might imagine, this got a little bleak.<br /><br />However, this was an absolutely fascinating book that I can highly recommend.  He covers the history of cancer treatment to the present day, and he even makes space to discuss some of the basic discoveries of cancer biology (e.g., tumor promoters and tumor suppressors).

It will not hold a charge and will only last 30 seconds before needing a new charge or the terminals being cleaned. Otherwise, it is a good product for what I need it for-quick cleaning of crumbs under the table and bar after meals, getting dust bunnies out from under low pieces of furniture. It wasn't designed for more in depth cleaning. You will need your big gun for that. I have an Oreck. Nothing compares to that.

It's massively addicting, even when you're not putting much thought into it. There is something rewarding in finding a new element, and the comments are amusing. You can also tell that the makers put a lot of thought into what happens when two things come together. In all, great game. The only problem I have is that it does not have a picture when it appears in the carousel on my Kindle Fire, which is a shame, because I really like the game's Icon.

On my son's birthday, he gave each of the attendees a monster as a party gift.  Everyone thought it was super cool and fun that he had hand-made them a party favor.  So fun!

0439023491|3.0|I did not find Catching Fire as exciting as The Hunger Games.  For me, it dragged out in certain areas, although I understand that the author was trying to expand the reader's knowledge of her characters and the layout/history of Panem.

But then all the erotic tales towards the second and third book became repetitive where I decided to skip all the \\"sex\\" and get right to the story. The storyline is great, however, I feel almost like I was cut short or rushed through at the end of the trilogy. As if almost the author decided to take a really bad potty break and tried to cram the ending at the end of this book and was left feeling unsatisfied. If time was taken to write this book I would be sure that it'd be MORE than just a trilogy and more on the lines of like a Harry Potter series. I don't regret reading it.

Her breakout album wasn't that impressive, to me (nor was the second), but I feel like she's really developed with her latest releases.<br /><br />So, given that little summary; I think this album is pretty dang awesome. It's either a little better or a little worse than \\"The Fall\\", depending on how much you like the production of Danger Mouse. OR...maybe if you're a lyric analyzer, which I'm not.<br /><br />I'm really surprised at these low reviews of the album. I decided to read them to see what the big deal was...seems they're mostly criticizing lyrics (...every album has to be Nobel prize poetry?), or the music production. If you're a long-time Nora fan, and any of that sounds like something you'd dislike, you might dislike this album, but I think the changes are pretty slight.

No dice...after many hours of playing around with it, the Zune 30 firmware just doesn't recognize the CF size(the player kept formatting it as 150 mb! and it's an 8GB).<br /><br />So, to get at least some use from the CF card...I bought this KingSpec case. It will work well as a portable drive, on which I will probably install Ubuntu. Nice thing about CF is the speed > SD.<br /><br />Minus one star because on mine the ZIF connector is off-center, which may force you to use a longer ZIF cable. Luckily, I had two extra ones that were about twice as long as the one it comes with.<br /><br />If you search on amazon, they also have SD to ZIF cards, so you could make yourself a pretty sizable portable drive for pretty cheap (SD cards are WAY cheaper than CFs).<br /><br />Overall, happy, glad I got it.

0307454568|3.0|I know that this is going out on a limb and may anger some readers but I honestly don't believe Stieg Larsson actually wrote this entire book. And am I the only one who finds his sudden death suspicious? No question he died way before his time (and quite possibly before this book was finished.) Maybe I do suffer from paranoia but I think there are two very suspicious elements of the story here. I've read a lot about this man and the drama surrounding his life. Ever since I read about his reluctance to marry his girlfriend because he feared for her safety against his political enemies, I have thought his premature death due to \\"heart attack\\" was odd. Now my suspicions have grown to include the idea that a ghost writer may have actually written the majority of this novel. I don't doubt Stieg Larsson came up with the idea and probably wrote a vast majority of the text but something never felt right about this third installment.<br /><br />This book is nowhere near as exciting as the first two novels. I kept complaining that this one was pretty boring and it just wasn't the caliber that made the first two so hard to put down. I was literally up each night until three a.m. reading The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo and The Girl Who Played With Fire but The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest (which is over 800 pages long- a sign that something was different since the others were closer to 300-400 pages long) seemed boring and less focused. The main character Lisbeth Salander spends the majority of this book in the hospital and has virtually no contact with the other main character Mikael Blomkvist. Also the story is so convoluted that I could never remember who was who. Just like the first book included a family tree, this book should have included a \\"police tree\\" to help the reader remember all the people in the police or goverment or who worked for the various publishing companies.<br /><br />All in all, this book was okay. I was definitely disappointed to say the least and I wanted more. For example, I was hoping Lisbeth's sister would play a role in this book. There is so much more that could have been done with both sisters but I honestly believe that the author died before he could fine-tune this book, instead leaving it to someone else to finish. Conspiracy theory? Maybe I have been reading too many Stieg Larsson books but I think it's a bit suspicious that this book was published posthumously and is so different from the previous two. It wasn't until I was on page 750-something where the book mentions Salander's age to be 27 and something clicked in my mind... It just seemed odd since there is so much mention of technology, specifically in reference to computers and cell phones, which I didn't think had advanced that far in 2004. If Larsson really wrote the third book and he died in 2004 it seems a bit anachronistic (for lack of a better term.) It seems as if someone else wrote this text and a little more recently than 2004. I mean why wasn't this book released prior to 2007 or whenever it was released?<br /><br />I guess I am digressing from the review but I think one must take into consideration the possibility that what I am proposing may be true. I think it certainly affects the review of this book. If I am right (and unfortunately we may never know) and Larsson had not died (or possibly been killed) before finishing the book then maybe we would have a better book to review. This book is wordy and in several places weak to the point of being pathetic. It is definitely not as good as the first two books in the trilogy. I gave it three stars in my review because I did enjoy some parts of the book, though the interesting parts took til about page 450-something to get to. Also annoying is that some of the translations from Swedish did not make sense in English. This occurred a few times throughout the book. This book could have benefitted from some editing. It meanders on for the first half, only starting to come together abouthalf-way through. The story suffers as well. As I said before, the two main characters barely have any contact throughout the book. Though this worked in the second novel, I guess I hoped that this third novel would bring them back together for a working relationship if not a romantic one. I hate to say it but this trilogy ends with a whimper instead of a bang.half-way through. The story suffers as well. As I said before, the two main characters barely have any contact throughout the book. Though this worked in the second novel, I guess I hoped that this third novel would bring them back together for a working relationship if not a romantic one. I hate to say it but this trilogy ends with a whimper instead of a bang.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've played a number of nonogram puzzles on various platforms. While I've only just started with this one, it seems like a good incarnation. The interface is simple and effective. I particularly like that it logically crosses out numbers as you fill the spaces. The hold-sweep move to mark a line of squares is useful as well (and it works for coloring them in, marking as Xs, or erasing as well). The fonts and graphics are very readable.<br /><br />There is one thing you can't do with CrossMe's interface: mark a square as a guess and move forward to see if your guess pans out, with the ability to lock in or revert all those deductions at once. The iOS game \\"Shady Puzzles\\" does an admirable job of this, and even allows up to three nested or parallel guesses. When you get to the more complicated puzzles, you occasionally do need to try out a possibility and see if it leads to a contradiction or not, so I miss this facility. I'm debating knocking a star off my rating for this, but for now, I'll let it stand. CrossMe does seem to have unlimited levels of undo (although no redo), so you can with some care at least explore one guess at a time.<br /><br />As others mentioned, some of the larger puzzles are a bit tricky to fill precisely - you'll be best on a tablet for those, and a stylus certainly wouldn't hurt. However, pinch-zoom is implemented very smoothly, which will let you mark things accurately at the expense of not seeing the whole picture.<br /><br />The tutorial is not particularly good. If you don't know how to play nonograms, you'll be pretty confused. It barely adequately covers the rules, and the one or two strategy tips it offers are confusingly worded. This part of the product could stand to be improved. Still, the gameplay is the thing, so I didn't strike a star from my rating for this.<br /><br />The product description is a bit bit vague about the number of puzzles. When asking the relatively high price of $4.95 for this normally, this is critical information for deciding the value. Anyway, I've gone through each level's selection screen and added them up, and (assuming there aren't any \\"hidden\\" puzzles or other things like that) there are 245 different puzzles here. Only 2 of these are throwaway tutorial levels; they're mostly the real deal. I haven't gone through even the first level yet so I can't say how well the difficulty scales, but I can at least say there's a nice variety in sizes and shapes of grids throughout.<br /><br />Absolutely grab this while it's the Free App of the Day. After that, $4.95 is as I say perhaps a little high, although that still works out to basically $.02 per puzzle so it's a bit miserly to complain. Most of these puzzles will take anywhere from two to 20 minutes to solve; $5 for that much intellectual entertainment really shouldn't be too much to ask.ation for deciding the value.

B001SRC9P8|2.0|I am a big fan of the show and did not like this book. I think if you are a fan of the show this book is not for you in anyway. I found my self not only not likeing the girls but hopeing that A gets them. The stroy in the book next to the tv show is just crazy if they did everything in the book on tv this show would be on HBO not ABC family. I just found the book to be very boring and nothing big ever happens that keeps me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />This book should be called  Pretty Little Hoes.
159102594X|4.0|I found this series tough to put down, but not wanting it to end.  Characters to cheer for and against.  Not everything turns out as you might hope, but twists and understanding of characters make outcomes understandable.  After finishing another trilogy (King Rolen's Kin) that left me totally disappointed and frustrated, this series has my anticipation up to find the next great series.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|If you've read my Kindle Fire review, then you know that I was (and quite frankly, still am) on the fence about the Kindle Fire. As a few astute reviewers mentioned, the Kindle and the Kindle Fire are so different that they are more complimentary to each than they are a replacement for one another. Wish I had known that little tidbit prior to purchase, but so be it.<br /><br />Regardless, I take very good care of all things related to books and my new device needed a new cover. I tend to be a little artsy-fartsy and had looked on Etsy for quite some time to get a cover but didn't see anything that I liked. Actually, I had just gotten a beautiful cover for my laptop and didn't want to be too matchy-matchy. So I found this Marware cover. Plain, understated, but solid and serene, and something fitting my reading machine.<br /><br />It has not disappointed. The case fits the Kindle Fire like a glove, the back cover folds back to create a perfect stand, and it's incredibly durable. It doesn't scratch or show wear and tear. My only issue - if you can call it that - is that it's a slightly lighter grey than it appears on the web site. I got grey so that it wasn't the standard-issue black electronics cover that everyone and their mother has, and would likely get the grey again knowing it's not exactly as it appeared.<br /><br />Two giant thumbs up for this cover - very impressed with Marware and would recommend their products to anyone.

B00828HWJE|4.0|When \\"Dragon Eyes\\" was first announced in the midst of Jean-Claude Van Damme's budding comeback, fans pompously stated that it'd be his definitive reanimation vehicle and was headed for movie theaters. Well, they were wrong on both counts - this one's not about to see the inside of an American theater and it's definitely not a vehicle for Van Damme - but this isn't reason to be disappointed, because despite being a DTV production, it's very good action movie. Not mind-blowingly good (Van Damme's own [[ASIN:B002U6CJCO Universal Soldier: Regeneration]] was superior, if you ask me), but nevertheless one of the better examples out there of quality martial arts flicks being feasible on a relatively small budget.<br /><br />The story: a soft-spoken martial artist (UFC star Cung Le, [[ASIN:B002QW7ALM Pandorum]]) - fresh from prison and the tutelage of his wizened teacher (Van Damme) - seeks to redeem his past by cleaning up a neighborhood sick with drugs, gang violence, and police corruption.<br /><br />As far as Van Damme goes, this movie does in fact mark a new stage in his career: it's the first time he's playing the role of a mentor, which is both satisfying at this point in his career and ironic, since the first time both he and Cung Le were mentioned together, he prophesized hostility between them (see one of his many online interviews in the last three years). Nevertheless, Van Damme's character plays almost entirely in the background and only has one (flashback) scene outside of prison. The movie is thoroughly a vehicle for Cung Le, whose last several years of playing supporting roles effectively bolster him to the status of a respectable action hero. The character he plays isn't particularly intriguing but he's got a fair presence and forcefully pushes most of his opposition aside as a film fighter. Peter Weller drastically steps away from his [[ASIN:B00005N7Z1 Robocop]] legacy to heighten the cast value as a memorable villain, with one of the best interrogation scenes I've seen in a while to his credit.<br /><br />The few reviews I've read about this film take aim at the story; I don't usually argue other peoples' opinions, but seriously - what were you expecting, guys? At any rate, I found no qualm with it: the plot itself is simplistic, but there are a handful of neat twists and character-based surprises to keep things interesting (e.g. Le's character earns control of a Latino gang and makes them surrender their firearms, because \\"Only cowards use guns\\"). With that said, there's one resoundingly weird event that doesn't add up, involving Cung Le's character escaping from a thoroughly impossible situation. Steven Seagal pulled a similar head-scratcher in [[ASIN:B000E6ESD0 Mercenary for Justice]], but Le's unexplained disappearing act takes the cake. How the heck did he put that policeman in the casket? Also, I was sort of disappointed by the ending, but the fact that I had just witnessed some very fine fight scenes helped soften its abruptness. Cung Le isn't Scott Adkins, but he offers an exciting alternative of MMA- and karate-based action. In my experience, mixed martial arts have fared better in Hollywood than low-budget features, but ol' Cung could be the one to even things out with the big leagues. I appreciate the variety of fights, their almost complete lack of one-sidedness, and how well pro fighters like Scott Scheeley and Trevor Prangley made the transition to cinefighting by Le's example. Indeed, the fight between him and the latter name is in the running for \\"brawl of the year\\" as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />The production isn't perfect, but nevertheless, it's very strong. DTV-isms like computer-edited montages and slow motion scenes exist, but you can almost feel director John Hyams fighting to keep them to a minimum. As much as for Cung Le, this film is a victory for him as well in managing to follow up his abovementioned \\"Universal Soldier\\" movie with a worthy new entry. Plainly said, I'm eager to see what all of these guys get up to in the future, and action fans in general would be in the wrong by not giving this one a serious look.hat all of these guys get up to in the future, and action fans in general would be in the wrong by not giving this one a serious look.

It is also quite difficult to remove and put back in place and does collect quite  a bit of lint and dust underneath. the case seem to offer adequate protection for the phone although the rubber at the corners could have been thicker. overall im happy  with the case and it does look good on the phone too,not too bulky. just wish it wasn't so slippery.

1401923127|3.0|This book's subtitle is Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter & Miracles, so as an avid reader on matters related to spirituality and consciousness, I was excited to read it. The book also had two pages of endorsements within the front cover by several prestigious sources as well as high number of positive reviews on Amazon. I approached my reading with high expectations after such raving reviews.  In the spirit of full disclosure on my mindset for spirituality, I am a firm believer in Original Cause and appreciate scientific theories/studies that harmoniously unite the two mindsets of science and spirituality. I am a also a firm believer that more information should be made available to support their complementary nature as opposed to their segmented viewpoints. I admire and encourage the scientific community that is brave enough to come forward within this context.<br /><br />On the other hand, I am also expect authors to provide at least a thread of content in their book as it relates to the title. I think that perhaps using Understanding instead of Unleashing in the book's subtitle may have been much more appropriate. At the end of the day, I found no content that provided suggestions, theories, practices or methods for Unleashing anything other than a long drawn out and somewhat repetitive explanation of cellular structure and functionality.<br /><br />I consider myself to be fairly smart and I wanted to understand the correlation between the cells, their membranes and how this might all relate to consciousness, but the level of detail that Lipton chose to share in this book was way over the top. Unless this book was intended to be part of the curriculum for a high school or early college biology course, there is just no need to go into the level of specifics about how our cell's amino acids are assembled or providing diagrams on the molecular composition of different protein molecules. I tell you it took every ounce of effort I had and a few cups of coffee to get through the 5 out of 7 chapters in this book that dealt with biological details that I will never remember and that could have been described within a page or two to support the author's viewpoints.<br /><br />I did appreciate the authors attempt to present this dry and specific material in a lighter and conversational manner than most would find in a textbook, but nevertheless the material was extensively detailed for a book that ultimately intended to talk about consciousness and spirituality. I did enjoy the chapter Lipton wrote about Conscious Parenting, entitled: Conscious Parenting: Parents as Genetic Engineers . Don't let the chapter title scare you too much, in this chapter I actually found some theories and studies explained in more general terms which helped to get the authors points across.<br /><br />Some really sour grapes for me where the social statements that were included. I am not a fan of authors using a book to push their social agenda when the book is categorized as something else. Regardless of whether I believe in the social statement or not is not the point. The book is about one thing (according to the title and book description) and should not be used to gather a captive audience to get on a soapbox about some societal issue. If you want to talk about that issue, write a book about it that clearly informs the reader about your content.<br /><br />I'm sure the Lipton intends this viewpoint to be a part of his unleashing of consciousness and a responsible topic to discuss (the statement he is making at the end of the book is about how humans are destroying the earth and each other and we are destined to annihilation if we don't change our conscious behaviors) - but in my viewpoint this is a topic best discussed as part of a venue where your audience is receptive to these viewpoints, not captive. Additionally, what makes this stand out as a social ideological platform rather than a highly generic solution to expanded consciousnesswas the contradictions in his own theories. Either you believe in global limitations (human destruction of the planet) or your believe in cellular infinite adaptation (constantly expanding based on biological and spiritual variables.)<br /><br />For a reader looking to gain insights about how science and spirituality comingle and combine into a harmonious relationship, this book is for you only if you enjoy the high end of the science portion of this equation. For me, someone who enjoys exploring scientific and spiritual concepts and getting background on the concepts presented, this book was way too detailed on the science side of things and very weak on the spirituality side of things. I was able to get his point overall about cellular behavior based on environmental input, but by getting so granular into the science of the cellular structure, I lost interest overall. Frankly, I only finished the book so that I could review it. I would not be able to recommend this book to readers that are interested primarily in consciousness as it relates to both science and spirituality.<br /><br />I did find the writers style and presentment to be easy to read, but if you are presenting material that is dry and over saturating, your casual writing style gets eaten up by your love of hearing yourself talk about details no one cares about or will ever remember (unless you are also a scientist). Finally, the readers do not ever really get a sense of how we might improve our biology of belief, even though the authors states several times we can and that he, in fact, has.was the contradictions in his own theories.

B007R3AZNK|4.0|There is something for everyone in this release. My initial reaction was positive as I liked most tracks on the first listen. JB is really settling down into a more musical style on this one. There is a little less of the \\"look what I can do with a guitar\\" on this one. Don't get me wrong, his guitar licks are cleaner and faster than ever (when appropriate). The mastery just sounds that much better when it is sprinkled here and there instead of constant sensory overload. There are even tracks that could crossover into modern country hits. I'm hearing strats, teles, and all sorts of textures along with the trademark Les Pauls.<br /><br />Standout tracks for me were New Coat of Paint, Dislocated Boy, and Driving Towards The Daylight. The only track that didn't make it to my MP3 player was Heavenly Soul. Not that it is bad, just not really my taste (at all). I think the title track may very well turn out to be Joe's first commercially successful \\"hit\\". I'm not exactly sure in which chart, but it is a great song. Ironically, this was my least favorite song when I recently heard him live. I think his touring drummer (who was great on all other songs) overpowered the song with an unnecessary March-like constant 1-2-3-4 kick drum that didn't allow the song to breathe like it does with Anton (but I digress).<br /><br />Great cd - buy it, you won't be disappointed! Grammy nod on this one? I think so...

I had to read it with her... I'm crazy like that... peer pressure!!!!<br /><br />This book has so many ups and downs that my heart was on an emotional roller coaster THE ENTIRE TIME I was reading it... I was literally laughing through tears at some points... not sure if I was happy about that, but that just makes for an interesting book..<br /><br />Gideon (weird name BTW) and Eva are sooo eff'd up and so determined that you can't help but feel the tention, sexual or not and the power of love chiming in here and there... I'm not sure I liked how the book ended... I know there's another one coming, but it left me unfulfilled to a certain degree!!!  Nothing is getting resolved between these two... and more crap keeps getting added to Ava's plate where he's concerned...<br /><br />All in all... It was a great read... I wouldn't say \\"better than Fifty Shades,\\" but a great read none-the-less... He had Christian Grey quality, but he's not as hot or as forthright with info... He wants so bad to keep Ava and he does the bare minimum it'll take to keep her until the next blow up and then he give a little more... why not just bare it all now... Ava did!!!<br /><br />Can't wait for the next one Deeper In You... hopefully some things get resolved in it... HOPEFULLY :-)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book so disturbing.  As the mother of a young woman the same age as the female lead,  all I can think about this is how many young women are reading this book and thinking that this type of behavior might be ok.  My problem is not about the sex scenes (about 60 percent of book), but the domination and abuse of a naive young woman who justifies the mans behavior all in the name of love.<br />This is not a romance by any stretch of the imagination.  I hate that this book has taken America by storm and will be influencing countless young women.

B007CKNX28|3.0|Like a lot Jack White-associated music, this album is uneven.  At times excellent, maybe great, but at other times clichéd and undercooked.  What's interesting is that fans and critics disagree among themselves about which songs (or parts of songs) are in which category.  Hypocritical Kiss and Take Me with You When You Go are my two favorites, combining country, soul and a little rock.  Sixteen Saltines is the sole pure rock song here, and it does rock, though its close resemblance to about a dozen White Stripes songs undercuts its replayability a bit.  Freedom At 21 has cool drums and guitar.  Missing Pieces musically is very cool, but something about Jack White's singing on it is annoying.  The title track is barely a song - it seems to be one piano chord progression on repeat with variations. Heard in 30 second clips, it sounds beautiful, but as an entire song, it qualifies a Wilco B-Side.  There's lots of good stuff on this album, and it is consistently catchy.  Part of the problem (for me, anyways) is that Jack White has about three singing modes - complaining, desperate and victimized.  Still, this album, like almost every album he's been a part of, has at least 3-4 really good songs, songs that stand above all the trash out there.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|\\"Viva la vida or death and all his friends\\" - album released on June 11th 2008 by famous rock band from London - Coldplay, was sold in more than ten million copies in last four years. It made me and other thousands (if not millions) of people fall in love with the soft, but powerful sounds played by four British musicians. I'm absolutely positive to say that there's not a song on \\"Viva la vida\\" album that I didn't like.<br /><br />What is the secret of massive gain of popularity of Coldplay after releasing the album in 2008 and the extremely high number of copies sold? I thiink that the answer is simple. Every song on the CD is like a piece of puzzle. Only when you put them all together, they create a complete masterpiece.<br /><br />Coldplay provided us with ten creative and different musical experiences. \\"Life in technicolor\\" introduces the album with two and a half minute instrumental melody that makes you feel like you were in a big city and watching it waking up (with sun rising slowly in the sky). Every song matches the theme of love and war. Lyrics are definitely catchy, but certainly not cliche. Every word is said in the right moment. They make you think about life situations, reflect about you past. There is huge variety of songs, from slow sweet ballads to powerful and energetic ones like \\"Lost\\" or \\"Viva la Vida\\". In between we have a chance to dream and relax during lovely and soft \\"Reign of love\\", \\"Violet Hill\\" and many more.<br /><br />The overall message of each song in mature and important. \\"Lost\\" teaches us that \\"just because I'm losing, doesn't mean I'm lost\\". \\"Viva la vida\\" metaphorically describes being at the top and falling down. \\"Violet Hill\\" takes us back to cold winter time, while \\"Strawberry Swing\\" is definitely a 'spring' song. Album ends with \\"Death and all his friends\\". Last few minutes of this longer song, sound like a completion of \\"Life in technicolor\\". It makes the CD very complete.<br /><br />I definitely LOVED listening to \\"Viva lavida or death and all his friends\\". I enjoyed the arrangement of piano and guitar music, which wasn't boring at all. Coldplay is the best 21st century rock band and this album proves it. [[ASIN:B001AU8ZLK Viva La Vida]]

B0065GC0BA|5.0|A little piece of me died when I finished this book. The characters were so likeable (well, the ones you're meant to like), particularly Will, who for some reason reminded me a little of Augustus Waters in spirit (I couldn't explain it if I tried...). I felt invested in the characters' lives, which is uncommon these days, I find, and didn't want to put it down. It's fairly well written, but I can't remember all the details like that, all I remember is the story, the characters and how much of an emotional effect it had on me. For that alone I give it 5 stars. I am unashamed to admit that for the last twenty minutes of the book, and for about ten minutes afterwards, I was crying uncontrollably. I love books that make me feel this way. Why are the best books so emotionally draining? I definitely recommend it.
B0081KTI0E|2.0|Oh dear, they just cannot get this one to translate to film.<br /><br />I love this play, I've seen it in London three times and really, there's no way to translate the brilliance of three actors, very sparse stage design and an old theater. The story is extremely simple and effective. The use of disturbing sound design and ONE ghost is used sparingly and with very creepy results. It works brilliantly and always sells out. I'm clearly biased. My bad.<br /><br />The original movie isn't particularly creepy and this one is only slightly better. They should have kept this story pared down. The more superfluous embellishment you add onto a story like this, the more weighed down it becomes. I don't like the addition of the clairvoyant, a ressurected carriage, ghost children, or the body. It's all so unnecessary. An effective ghostly tale makes your mind wonder at what's in the dark? What are the motives, when and how will the next manifestation begin? You have to use more than just visual senses. Goading the imagination, sound and keeping the story tight are so important.<br /><br />Anyway; great sets, costuming, acting: that kind of thing. If you're easily scared, like spooky or love Daniel then you may enjoy this.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|If you've lived inside the shelter of parents/church/spouse/daycare your entire life, and never had to go out into the world and make your way, then don't bother watching this movie. You will be offended by the language, shocked by the candor, and permanently scarred by the experience. If you HAVE cut your own swath in this world (and worked in some capacity of sales) you will LOVE this movie, laugh your head off, and want to memorize Alex Baldwin's unforgettable speech to the \\"losers\\". COFFEE IS FOR CLOSERS!!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said about this book? \\"11/22/63\\" was everything that I wanted it to be. Great characterization, a solid plot, a significant number of twists and turns, and a satisfying ending were all part of this voluminous work. It's a better book than King's most recent humongous tome', \\"Under the Dome\\" if, for no other reason, because it's written with more passion (but I did like \\"UtD\\"). King's done his homework and really makes the reader feel part of the world of the late '50s and early '60s. Baby Boomers, especially, will relate to the many references to '50s TV shows, commercials, products, and the like.  The bottom line...King's legion of fans won't be disappointed because this is more like the earlier works of \\"The Master\\".  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I think it is a very fun app but when you use too many photos they don't let you use anymore. That makes me mad alittle. I like the app though.
B003L77G6A|5.0|What can I say? Big Bang Theory is the ONLY show I regularly watch on network TV. It's still funny and fresh, and the addition of Mayim Bialik this season made it even better.
B007C6HHOM|5.0|It is so convenient with Prime Member to be able to pay for an episode and watch it whenever, and as often, as you like.  The connection is true and the picture is clear.  The sound is very good.
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|A truly remarkable love story that will never leave you. Beautiful and full of humor and cheer. Five star plus!
0345803493|1.0|I bought all three of the Fifty Shades book amid all the hype and recommendations from friends.  I started on book one and three chapters in I couldn't stand the characters!  Anastasia is annoying and I hate the way Christian talks.  So, getting impatient, I skimmed through books two and three, looking for something that would keep me engaged.  No luck--I hate their stupid emails to each other, I hate the way Anastasia repeatedly says \\"Holy Crap\\" to herself, and even the erotic scenes were repetitive.  I gave up, and brought my books to work, where my coworkers scooped them up.  I used to be the kind of reader who would finish a book once I started it.  But these books made me realize life is too short to stay with something that just irritates me.
B0083EW97W|4.0|By simple I don't mean easy to make, the album is very well put together and has a great easy flow. This is not an album to turn up on a Saturday night but a true Sunday afternoon, long drive, or working on a project record. The light singing over the delicate guitar picking sparks a direct comparison to a young Paul Simon. If you like the lighter side of John, you will definitely enjoy this album. If you want to sample a song to get the best feel for the album, stream Speak For Me. Enjoy a really nice album.
B007RI56NY|4.0|This is one of my favorite groups.  I was waiting for the new release and it lived up to my expectations.
0345803493|5.0|great continuance to the first book... I loved learning more about Christen Grey and the reason he is the man he is today. All the sex scenes in this book are just as great as the first one and even better because he loves Anastasia now and he admits that to her. I enjoyed this book a lot. I read it in 2 days.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|I'm torn between giving this game 5 stars because its awesome or 3 Bc I cant open it after closing it on my Kindle Fire. I reinstalled and the same thing hsppened, just got a black screen when i tried to reopen. The premise of the game is great and although the instructions are a little weak, I got the hang of it in no time... so if you're complaining about the instructions and cant figure it out in your own, then this game is clearly not for you. The squares get smaller as the puzzle gets bigger but I have a stylus so that didn't bother me. Please fix the KF bug and ill rate 5 stars!!
B0083GQKQG|4.0|The negative reviews are obviously from people who do not enjoy a realistic look at the tragedies that life can throw our way. We Need to Talk About Kevin is an insightful look into how young murderers are born. The psychological undertone of how his mother influenced him from infancy is not often seen in movies, which is why this movie was so great. There are not many movies like this one, and like others before who have braced the deviant side of movies, it has gotten some baleful reviews, but the acting was on point, the subject matter extremely interesting, and the way it goes back in time from age to age is interesting, making small connections. Those who were dissatisfied with the time period changes are obviosly used to a simpler movie with a cliche story line. This movie is worth the watch, and the book is now a must-read for me.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I will never get tired of watching these shows. Such imagination and pure silliness...hard to step away...and my kids are loving them too...
1439152799|3.0|While the story kept me interested enough to finish the book it became tedious at times because of the needless \\"thinking out loud\\" on the part of the narrating charecter. There were pages of overly descriptive detail explaining  the obvious. . A very slow read.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I really loved this book, I' just not sure I have the energy to write a thorough review. It was VERY LONG, but well worth the time.
1594481717|5.0|I was a fan of \\"Free Agent Nation\\" by Daniel Pink.  This book is another good read.<br /><br />It boils down to this: aesthetics matter.  Attractive things seem to work better. Tapping into human connectedness and style -- that is smart business.<br /><br />Every chapter has a portfolio -- things to DO to follow up on the chapter's ideas.  That is incredibly valuable -- that alone is worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Daniel Pink has a  good grasp of research and culture, and a fundamentally readable writing style.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable evening's read -- and one with many dog-eared pages.  I added 10 or 15 items to my wish list because of this.<br /><br />Good one.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|All in all its a pretty decent app. Downside is you have to be near wifi to get app to work. Wants to update every few minutes. Or it will not upload because app is searching for updates. Before you could skip this part and go straight to the game.  Gets to be a pain in the you know what. Get this problem worked out it will be a great app.
B006886HDC|4.0|A friend of mine loaned me the DVDs. I must admit, being somewhat of a simpleton when it comes to movies and TV shows (the more shooting and blowing stuff up the better and if there are vampires in the mix,  I'm in heaven), it took some time until I found myself with absolutely nothing to do and totally bored out of my mine before I finally decided to pop in DVD #1 into my player and watch - All I can tell you is I was hooked right from the start. I never really understood just how important a role John Adams played in the birth of this nation or the passion that burned within him to do whatever it took to gain freedom from Great Britain. I was totally mesmerized.<br /><br />In addition, watching how folks lived in those times will give you great appreciation for things we take for granted today like Anesthesia, electricity, air conditioning, Dentist and anesthesia (yes I know I said it twice, but if you watch the mini series, you will know why).<br /><br />And finally, Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney give a kick ass performance as Mr. and Mrs. John Adams the 2nd president and first lady of our nation. That alone was worth the price of admission.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Having spent a good part of my working career in financial markets and having been on both sides of corporate restructures, I feel that I am in good position to comment on \\"Margin Call\\".<br /><br />The essence of \\"Margin Call\\" is a 24 hour period when a large New York investment bank comes to the realisation that it has seriously underestimated its potential exposure to risky and illiquid financial instruments.  In the argot of the industry, the bank has an enormous \\"value at risk\\".  However, it only came to this understanding by accident.  A \\"down-sized\\" employee stumbles upon the problem and leaves it to a 28 year old \\"rocket scientist\\" to finish his work.<br /><br />The bank is shocked to its core.  It drags its board together in the dead of night to consider its options.  In fact, there is really only one.  Namely, the bank's huge position will have to be cut the following day and damn the consequences.<br /><br />This is a tightly scripted film with an excellent cast. Paul Bettany as the desk manager, Kevin Spacey as the dealing room's chief and Jeremy Irons as the bank's chairman are all excellent.  They have real street cred.  Dealing rooms spawn often less than endearing individuals.  \\"Margin Call\\" reflects this fact well.<br /><br />I thoroughly recommend this film.  It is plausible and certainly timely given the events of the past several years in global markets.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I certainly enjoyed the suspense. It was an unusual setting but a great thriller. Seemed like a slow start, but eventually I didn't want to put it down.
B007H9B8FS|4.0|Garbage Version 5.0 seems to fall under the dreaded term \\"back to basics\\", which too often means \\"boring\\" and \\"same old same old\\". But this is pretty much the most any fan of the band could really hope for, though, because otherwise, where do they go? The experimental \\"Beautiful Garbage\\" was OK, but left a lot of fans pretty lukewarm. The loud, abrasive \\"Bleed like me\\" saw a return to their high-volume past, but with often boring songs - the sound of a band on the cusp of walking out the door. So what we have now is a group who shrewdly mixes up the creativity and slam-bang nature of the first album with the great songwriting and pop sensibilities of \\"Version 2.0\\". And don't let any reviewers here tell you that the four \\"bonus\\" tracks on the special-edition aren't right up there with the first eleven - in fact, those four are some of my favorites on the album. Every song here brims with the usual tight composition, unwieldy guitar buzz and electronic flourish that has always been their trademark. For me, best Garbage album since Number Two.
B007R6X9IK|5.0|If you're a fan of Dave Gahan's past strayings from Depeche Mode, you'll love this one.  It's right up there with Paper Monsters.  Musically, it's probably superior, but in a completely different aspect.  As far as likeability and replay value, it's a winner.  If Paper Monsters was a 10 this one would be a 9.8.  Dave sounds as good as he ever has, and there are plenty of \\"goosebumps\\" moments in this album for sure.  Moody and melancholy compared to Dave's body of work as a whole.  It will definitely be a staple in my summer playlist!
B007VL7OIW|5.0|I'm loving Joey's second (posthumous) solo album.It is great to hear Joey's voice again, singing these new songs.Ya Know is not just a punk album-there is a lot of range here.The 15 songs also flow exceptionally well together with a top notch production.<br /><br />The album kicks off with the upbeat \\"Rock N Roll is the Answer\\".A very rocking song to get you going.\\"Going Nowhere Fast\\" and New York City\\" could have been on a Ramones album.The anthemic latter is like a punk rock \\"Empire State of Mind\\" (with lyrics like \\"The Ritz and the Cat Club,Pyramid and Limelight\\").Other highlights for me include \\"Seven Days of Gloom\\"(\\"Seven days of gloom,here in my room.If it wasnt for Stooges my life would be doomed\\").Great song with backing vocals by the handsome one Dick Manitoba.The Phil Spectorish \\"Party Line\\" is just a heavinly song Joey sings with Holly Beth Vincent of Holly and the Italians.Then there is the honkeytonk punk of \\"I Coudn't Sleep\\" and the  country-influenced \\"Waiting for That Railroad\\".The album closes with the pretty acoustic version of \\"Life's a Gass\\" with chimes that sounds very bittersweet.<br /><br />Ya Know? is a truly must have for every Ramones fan (or rock fan in general).
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love this game but my newest quest to clear flowers wont work. I cleared 20 and it says 0.<br /><br />please update ..
0143121006|5.0|It was a sad, excellent book. It was a good description of old China which no longer exists. A foolish, young girl, some venal, reprehensible men, a determined father, and a justice system that malfunctioned.It is very well worth reading.
B003TU167O|5.0|Bought these for a replacement of a pair of Teva Terradactyl sandals I had purchased 15 years ago.  They had been all over the world in sand and water but the glue was finally giving out.  These new ones look almost identical and I am hoping they last as long.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|This is a very good nonogram or Hanjie puzzle game and is excellently represented via this app and works beautifully on my kindle fire.<br /><br />The game looks very difficult to play at first but once you learn the only few tricks you need to master this game all the puzzles become easy to solve. The tutorial is available in the app for basic usage skills but you probably will get better idea solving techniques by Google search the word \\"nonogram\\".<br /><br />The menu screens and game-play is very good and pinch to zoom makes it easy to choose cells which are difficult to select when zoomed out - thanks for that.<br /><br />Also, to fill the line at one TAP and hold on a cell a \\"RING\\" will appear and thereafter move that ring to fill a full row of cells rather than tapping each cell one at a time. For more tips press the ? button on the app.<br /><br />Overall it is a very good free app of the day but I doubt anyone would shell out $4.95 for this puzzle coming tomorrow when they need to pay full price.<br /><br />To keep the review honest I have taken one star off the rating due to the steep pricing of the game. In reality it is a 4 star game. If I ever see this game sell at 99c I will update my review with 4 star rating.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was concerned with purchasing this series partly due to the price, but mostly because I have felt let down by other books I have been reading.  I decided to download the sample and by the end I could not wait to read on, despite the price tag.  Since then I have not been able to put this book down.  I found myself anxious for any moment that I could get to read.  At times I was even sneaking in chapters under the guise of working. I found myself staying up at night just because I could not find a good \\"stopping point\\".<br /><br />This series took my mind off of reality and made me think of my life in a different way.  The overall love story and finding acceptance and comprising though are what made these books really stand out.  The characters come to life very easily and it is easy to find parts of yourself in each of them.  Some of the phrases in the book are now stuck with me and I have found myself repeating them at times.  I would love to read these again, but from Christian's point of view as the author started at the end.  I am going out now to buy these for my three daughters as I know they will love them as much as I did.
B0058VW36U|3.0|This game was ok I did not love it but what bugged me<br />was that it costs less on an ipod.
0307951529|4.0|This book could be called the Accidental Startup because some of these business ideas were developed by accident or a result of people making money off a hobby or meeting an unusual unmet need. The examples are inspiring. That's the strength of the book. Anyone can start a business with little or no money. Just setup a fan page on Facebook, get some followers and create products to sell to your fans (that's my idea, not a specific example from the book). I'm always thinking of ideas to make money that start small and I hope my ideas grow to the point where they could make millions. This book definitely inspires me to re-think some of these ideas and not try to plan how I'll make a million but start small and let the process take its course slowly and course correct along the way. If I'm lucky, maybe one or two will be a success.<br /><br />But unfortunately, the book loses focus. In the beginning, the author teases us with the humble origins of some of these businesses and promises that he'll tell us how they got off the ground. But the author starts giving the reader guides on how to get started. As he does that, he sprinkles in an example or two to illustrate his points. Then the reader has to remember or refer back to the tease earlier in the book to put the two parts of the story together. I would have preferred if he talked more about the companies and used their specific story to illustrate certain ideas on how to grow an unusual business idea.<br /><br />For example, I would have liked to learn more about the closeout mattress delivery company. Did he come up with the bike delivery part of the business by accident? How does a person ride a bike with a king sized mattress on it? How do customers react to someone delivering a mattress by bike? What if it rains? How does one person move a mattress from a bike into someone's house? How did he teach potential customers that closeout mattresses were a viable product? Or the piano teacher who developed a schedulingprogram. What program did he need to buy? Did he do the programming or did he hire someone to do it? How much money did he need for the project? How did he get people to accept and buy the software? Or how did the bookkeeper sell her services and compete with all the bookkeeping and accounting firms in her area?<br /><br />If he took the top 25 companies and told the reader how they got past the hurdles from idea to viable businesses, that may have been a better book. But I did like the book and will re-read it and refer back to it for ideas and examples so the business ideas I have in my head might become a reality.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I like it but its innapropriate at times. If your thinking that a little kid plays this game, I HIGHLY RECCOMEND. PUT CHILD SAFETEY ON!!!!!!!!!! thank you
B00004ST9Q|5.0|Product was received and I was very happy that it was as described (new) and I received in a timely manner. Ordered it from amazon. Great dvd I would highly recommend it!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Well, the oringinal iphine game is coming to kindle fire and more aneroid devices. Yeah!! You might think&quot;Why does it cost money?&quot; or &quot;Why not get the free version?&quot;. Here's the secret: on free version,you can only do two boxes, or at least that's what you can do on the apple version. But on here, you can get TONS of boxes &amp; levels. Keep earning stars to unlock more. If never gets old or crashes. Om Non will always be hungry, so the fun never ends! This is worth 99cents people!!
0345803485|4.0|I had trouble putting it down.  Well written with hot sex but as hot as the sex is it does not take away from the love or the complex people who are learning about one another. I am on book two and can't wait to read three! My sister told me to get this book the same time my best friend said the same thing. It is a great love story and the best thing about it is that rich or poor everyone comes with their past and if you love someone enough you decide if you can handle it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is very fun. If you are ever traveling, this would be PERFECT to entertain your kids with. I typically like to challenge my friends by getting two devices and seeing who can get to the end of the level fastest. It is my favorite game. Once you, get to World 6 or 7, the levels repeat, yet they make it harder by adding fire and creatures everywhere. If you like Mario, this is the game for you. ENJOY!
145162445X|5.0|The book needn't be longer than this because it has all the corrent facts, arguments, linearity in narration that make easy to understand what it written to expose, aka: \\"The universe came out of nothing\\".<br /><br />Krauss has a very clear cut writing style that never keeps you wondering why this and that; clarity of words used make this short book a many time read. Love the relevant graphs and pictures.<br /><br />This is my first Krauss book and it has surely made me put Quintessence and Atom on my Wish List.<br /><br />Keep 'em coming, Krauss! Would be nice if Krauss's next book would treat Singularity and Superintelligence in relation with cosmological data.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app is very helpful to me. I use it to write notes in class to help me study. I also use it to jot down quick notes about stuff I see advertised on t.v. It is also fun to change the color of your notes. If you wanted to, you could use it as a pink flashlight. I love this app. plus you can email, forward, and print your notes. replace your millions of pieces of paper you have in your purse with your phone or kindle. You won't have to spend money on notebooks anymore!Get this app
B007R3BFR0|5.0|This album blew my mind..The essence of the first album is felt here.Strong sensible lyrics with a kiss to the eighty's.Guest drummers Matt Chamberlain(Bad ass \\"session\\" drummer.wiki him.) and Matt Walker (filter,sp,etc,,)Blend this album like a fresh squeezed smoothie...(it's refreshing---A compliment)Butch Vig-amazing as always...Steve \\"maker's mark\\" Marker and Mr.Duke Erickson provide the soothing, yet at times- funky guitar twangs..It's all here... harmonica i heard in one song(battle in me) that threw me for a loop (yet amazing).This album is beyond my expectations and im glad that i bought my vinyl here on Amazon...I'd have to say that if you like all kinds of genre's like an a.d.d.,rock lovin fan as i am...get this album.Shirley kicks out the vocals like nobody's business.period.Hands down the best underrated album ive bought here.Garbage topped themselves again-...Thank You-Gary
B003521R6G|3.0|I loved the music and dancing.  Kevin Bacon does a creditable job, but this isn't the 1984 version of Rebel Without a Cause or American Graffiti. I graduated high school in 1963 and nobody thought it at all shameful to dance.  Churches even sponsored dances.  The old heresy that one would get to heaven if a person didn't dance, drink, smoke, play cards and not go to the picture show on Sunday.  To consider this breaking free from a stultifying moralistic  would mean breaking open a casket that had been planted so long the 50-year-old leak-proof guarantee had expired.  The film was very sedate, safe, but very entertaining.  I don't remember seeing it when it was released--one that got passed me.<br />  I remember a funny joke from my teen years.  A former straight laced young man celebrates saying, \\"I don't need, smoking, drinking, or dancing--I've found necking.
B004A1NMRS|5.0|Got this record so fast that i was shocked...So happy with this record.All the hits are here.get it...What are u waiting for?
031606792X|1.0|There were so many things wrong with this book that I don't even know where to start. It was a tremendous let down. At one point I was so angry that I threw it across the room in disgust. I don't even know if a talented editor could have fixed this hot mess.
0071762345|5.0|I run the online marketing for my company, and am thus in constant conversation with coworkers and acquaintances alike on the merits of certain thought leaders. As you can imagine, most Internet marketers are full of it.<br /><br />Ironically I've had a lot of exposure to Dave Kerpen in the past. I can safely say that I've learned much of my marketing skills from the content he provides his fans. You'd think that he would have used up all of his juice, but in spite of all of the great information he was pushing I was still able to find loads of useful nuggets in Likeable Social Media.<br /><br />The only social media marketing book I've read with as much enthusiasm is Gary Vaynerchuk's The Intention Economy, and I can say that Dave Kerpen's work is more helpful in the sense that he provides real world examples and action items that can be applied to one's work.<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their digital marketing horizons.
1469984202|5.0|This book was one I could not put down!  It was well written and kept me engaged from start to finish.<br />I don't know what else I could say that has not already been said here but wanted to recommend this book to anyone who<br />cares to read this review.  I am not a sci-fi fan but I loved this book.  I think no matter what genre you are privy too this book would be an enjoyable read for any audience.
B008510WAE|3.0|I got so excited to see this game on the Kindle Fire store... and at the time there wasn't any reviews yet... but yes please fix this problem. it does shut down immediately.<br /><br />update...<br /><br />i have figured out if you keep trying eventually it will load and once it does it stays open. it is fun once it is open. really good game, just takes forever to open because of the force close glitch. but if you are persistent, it will run.<br /><br />it now gets a 3 star because it still needs work
B0055S348W|5.0|I really love this app by far the best printing app I have used very useful. I would recommend this app
B000UZNRS2|4.0|Baldacci fans especially Camel Club fans -- if you haven't read it -<br />get it.<br />He has better books but this is okay.
1401235417|5.0|To sum my experience after reading this book: WOW!<br /><br />BATMAN: THE COURT OF OWLS Vol. 1 is a refreshing take on the Batman mythos. It builds on the premise of the rebooted DCU (New 52), and things certainly have become better (and more dangerous) for the Dark Knight.<br /><br />In a nutshell, this collection contains Batman # 1-7 of the rebooted DCU. Here we find the Dark Knight up against a legendary organization that has apparently controlled Gotham City for ages. You think Gotham is a City of the Bat? Think again! When Bruce Wayne begins pushing for some dramatic - and drastic - changes to improve Gotham City, the clandestine Court takes notice and deems his plans as counterproductive to their own. So what do they do? They send out their chief `equalizer', The Talon, to `straighten out' this crumple. From there, things spiral out of control for Batman!<br /><br />We find the Dark Knight up against an organization so mysterious that it is even taboo to even mention their names! The narrative progresses perfectly, and this story arc has elevated the bar of Batman lore to new heights.<br /><br />This is an excellent graphic novel and I praise Scott Snyder and Greg Capullo for breathing fresh life to the Batman mythos by introducing readers to the nefarious Court of Owls. With Snyder's magnificent work on [[ASIN:140123206X Batman: The Black Mirror]], fans can rest easy that the Dark Knight is in good hands.<br /><br />So the Court has decided unanimously, and has passed its judgment: Batman Must Die! Let's get ready to rumble and enter the NIGHT OF THE OWLS!<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0307949508|2.0|I picked this up by accident before all the hype about the books and the author.  Didn't like it at all.  I am not sure it was the author or a poor translator but it was a little stiff.  I realize this is the opposite of what everyone says but it is what it is.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|Delightful movie about commitment and freedom and the search for love.  The characters are tender and believable.  Great ending. The charaters are a bit zaney but believable enough.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a dedicated reader for the past 29 years of my life, the books I have read have easily reached in the thousands. I have taken a risk reading books that are on the best seller list on Kindle and have had issues with most of the books listed on it. From poor writing or such, loses me to rate it well. Reading this series was a risk I am glad I invested my time and money into. It grabs you and won't release you-even at the end of the book. You're lead with wanting a lot more from the author of this incredible series. I am always in awe of Sci-Fi novels that can grip audiences, even though they might not be a dedicated fan base from that genre. The imagination and skill set it takes to dream up something in your mind-and execute it within your writing, is incredible. To have it make sense in a world that makes no sense, is truly an accomplishment. For those debating reading it, just take a risk-you will be glad you did and join the masses of us who praise this book series.=)
0446572993|5.0|I just couldn't put this book down.  I was hooked by the third page and stayed that way until the end.  I love books that just hold your suspense until the end - it sure keeps one \\"turning the pages\\".  Awesome!!  Thanks Mr. Baldacci for another good read.
0345803485|5.0|The book is very captivating and hard to put down.  I am now reading the 2nd book and reading it every chance I get.  I highly recommend it!
B005QUQP76|5.0|Like a lot of people I have tried many mice for gaming over the years. This one is a keeper for me. I play FPS games with it exclusively and use it for web surfing. I like this mouse and would like to offer some suggestions for future improvement. The sniper button is great. (It slows the curser down for accuracy). It takes a while to get used to but for me the button would work much better if it was placed higher on the mouse and further back on the mouse. Also note for web surfing the wheel button does not have side to side movement like lots of surfing mice. It is a pure gaming mouse. To use all the features of the mouse you have to download software from the cosair web site. I found the documentation was very poor. It is very hard to figure out how to program the thing. I won't be using macros because of the documention. I also don't really see the need for the weights. The wheel button also takes a lot more effort to click down than I like to do sniper zooming. I am hoping it will loosen up after a while. After trying it for more time I may just use it like a regular mouse to game and forget the sniper button etc. Most gimmicky game controls just can not beat the old standard mouse in the long run. Oh I love the way this thing glides across the mouse pad so smoothly. It is a very good mouse with poor documentation.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is cool . would show to a friend.!!! absolutely. this game has many interesting games such as ice hockey
0060558121|5.0|I love historical fiction. I love mythology. I love Neil Gaiman. THis is a fantastic book. I am so sad that I devoured the book, then read ananazi boys and I have no more of this tale to be spoon fed to me. This is storytelling at its best. I love this book.
0345529057|5.0|I would highly suggest reading these novels. I can absolutely guarantee that putting down the novels will be the furthest thing from your mind when reading. They grasp your attention immediately. I would also recommend continuing on to watch the new television series on HBO. The TV series has so far stayed very true to George's original vision. They are both wonder pieces to behold and may even convince you to try getting into the writing game.<br /><br />I am currently reading this series and am on the third book of the four I own. The series consists of five novels in total at the moment, and George is planning on releasing six overall. I have to say the novels themselves are absolute marvels. There are numerous levels of plot filled with rich detail and interesting characters. The way George has gone about writing these characters leaves the reader siding with some that they would never had expected at the beginning. They all feel very human and make decisions based on qualities that are relatable.
0618871713|3.0|I am a fan of graphic novels and this is a very well done example of the genre.  The drawings and text work well together and the story line is interesting.  That said, it is not for everyone.  There are some graphic drawings of lesbian sex and the subject matter is heavy and depressing.  I realize the author is writing mostly from a child's perspective but her father's problems extended well beyond being a closeted homosexual.  Despite my criticism I am going to read her new book about her relationship with her mother.  It's a bit like gaping at a car wreck. You want to know what happened.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Really nice. It's larger than many more costly packs. This will hold two DSLR bodies and lenses with tripod holder on the side and extra pockets for batteries, etc. Works for my Canon 7D. Highly recommend this product & [[ASIN:B005DEHVC8 STK's Canon LP-E6 Battery 2600 mAH]].

B000059TFO|4.0|This purchase came new and on time. No damage to disk and it was packaged as it should be. It plays well and therefor I was very happy with my purchase.<br /><br />  Thank You<br /><br />  Barb
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|I downloaded this app not realizing the game is not completely free.....I uninstalled it after some sick jerk submitted me a drawing of a mans private package with the F word spelled out. This was a random opponent &amp; I uninstalled it before writing the screen name down.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Took me almost a year to read all five books. Books four and five were disapointing and book five was convoluted, anti-climatic and left you wondering what happened. So many characters that you cared about and situations just left hanging in mid air. Seems like the author just got tired of writing about it. Hope the HBO series will be better.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I have been watching Idol for 11 seasons and I think that Haley Reinhart may be the most significant artist to emerge from this powerful platform since Kelley Clarkson. She is that good. Some find her cocky, maybe a little arrogant. I think that she is confident. After listening to this CD you will know why. \\"Listen Up\\" is a powerful compilation of tunes that you would be hard pressed to rank in order of preference. They are ALL good. Usually one or two stand out and then there are the schlocky songs. Not this CD. All 10 are very solid.<br /><br />Ms. Reinhart has managed to come up with a very unique format, melding retro R & B / some elements of disco (tastefully) into a sophisticated, funky, yet still very much pop in genre CD - making it the ultimate crossover album. There are elements of the 60's girl bands- think Diana Ross and The Supremes \\"Wasted Tears\\", some Adele mixed in \\"Undone\\". There is also some songs that will become pure signature Haley, \\"Hit the Ground Running\\" and \\"Now That You are Here\\" are great as well with the latter being the best track on the album.<br /><br />I am blown away that 19 (Interscope records) let her make an album like this. It is completely different than any Idol album ever released, but in a very good way. I believe that Jimmy and the boys at Interscope have a lot of confidence in her abilty- she co wrote all the songs (except \\"Free\\"), and her dad plays guitar on four of the tunes.<br /><br />I believe that this is the start of something very big. It's hard to listen to this CD and think otherwise.
B00746O3X8|4.0|I was a little hesitant to order this product at first, but given the price I thought I'd order it and see how I liked it. I LOVE IT! I shoot sports photography and it's nice when you have 2 cameras that you don't have to constantly have to put one on the ground. Very comfortable to wear. Another photographer asked where I got and how much it was, because now he wants one.<br />I would have given it 5 stars, but my only negative comment is every once in a while the screw that holds the adaptor on your camera comes loose and you have to tighten it. Overall, a great product for a great price.
0525478817|5.0|A couple of years ago I went to my local library and picked up a copy of John Green's 'Looking for Alaska.' Soon after I found out that John had written more novels, and went to read them, too. They were very well written and inspiring. When I heard that John was writing another book, I pre-ordered it without hesitation. I did not regret that.. The Fault in Our Stars is a superb and thoughtful book that I would recommend to anyone. The messages that the book brings across are strong and poignant and they're something that we can all relate to. This book gave me a new perspective on life and the world that we live in. The Fault in Our Stars was the first book that I've read in a while to make me laugh, cry, and examine the world for a different standard. I definitely recommend this book to anyone, and I wouldn't say that about any book, so please give it a read.
B0067LXQAW|5.0|This is another great disc from this group.<br />If you own or have listened and enjoyed their work<br />you will not be disappointed. If you like Irish music<br />but have never listened to the Cranberries give this a listen.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is terrific!  It may actually be too useful.  These ease of sharing across different platforms really sets it apart.  Great the Kindle Fire as well as aneroid.  Well done.
1932100660|1.0|I bought this book and took the time after I read it to look up the study on the Internet, and found out this study was not a peer reviewed study.<br />Campbell would have you believe that this was a scientific study, but this simply is not true. Even some of the<br />researchers on the project quit because the data they collected did not support the study.<br />Do your home work and Google the Study and see for yourself.
B007TNS6JI|2.0|If you like FPS or RP camputer games, you will be disappointed in with this game. Slow reactions and repeative game play.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I am already on my second reading of this book.  It is a little gem, easy to read, to the point, and dense with attitude-adjusting, life-changing information.  I was desperate for a way to cope with a specific problem in my life and this book gave me exactly what I needed and much more besides.  It's one of those little treasures that will give you something new each time you read it, and you don't mind reading it again because it's small.  You can also pick out one of the four agreements to brush up on if you need to.  Great advice for making your life and your relationships more livable.  Everyone should read this book; the world would be a better place.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love the YouVersion Bible. there are so many Bible versions available. and I can even read in French to help me better learn the language. and the reading devotional plans are excellent. I have been wanting to try reading the Bible in 90days. that is a reading plan on YouVersion Bible!  I started with a plan all about knowing Jesus. I'm reading the message Bible and getting so much out of it. oh and it's completely easy to share verses on facebook. I love to be able to do that. I can highlight verses or commentary and make my own notes when I'm reading too. I am really so glad I got this app.
B006RUJST6|5.0|18-year-old Layken (or, \\"Lake\\") is still coping with the death of her father when her mother moves the family (Layken, her 9-year-old brother, and her mom) from Texas to Michigan. Lake's mother claims this is due to financial issues which have forced her to take a job with an old friend in Michigan. Lake isn't too happy about it, but she doesn't have a choice in the matter.<br /><br />Lake's sadness over the move quickly dissipates after meeting her new neighbor, Will. Just days after the move-in, Will and Lake go on a date; a date that changes everything for both of them. During and after their date, the two young adults experience a powerful connection unlike anything either of them has before.<br /><br />When Lake begins school the next week, an unexpected and unwelcome revelation takes place - one that dashes Lake's hope of a future with Will, and vice versa. It's now a matter of ethics and a matter of choosing what's most important in life - and their relationship isn't it. The couple struggles with keeping apart, but when Lake's life spins out of control in other ways, she can't help but turn to Will for comfort, and, ethically wrong or not, Will can't bring himself to deny her.<br /><br />- - -<br /><br />**Could be spoilery!**<br /><br />Where to begin?<br /><br />I guess I could start with the characters. Will and Lake. What can I say about them and their relationship? I feel like nothing I could say would sufficiently express just how amazing they are together. Will is a passionate character. His character radiated so much emotion when it came to just about everything - his job, his family, Lake, poetry, doing what's right. He did everything with purpose and with determination. I loved his character a whole lot right from the get-go. Lake, on the other hand, I had some problems with at first. She struck me as sort of petty in the beginning. When she couldn't have things the way she wanted them, she went into immaturity mode and started throwing tantrums. Eventually I grew to appreciate her, though. Even if not done in the most mature way, she spoke the truth and tried to go for what she wanted at all times. She was strong in her own way and determined to do the best she could with what she was given - which was a crappy situation.<br /><br />She and Will together? Well, that was something! Colleen Hoover did a great job with the intensity of their relationship. My heart was pounding away in my chest through the entire book. I cried and cried for this couple and their situation(s). This book turned me into a complete sap! I can't even describe just how beautiful their love was. It was passionate and tragic and beautiful... I really don't know what else to say about it other than WOW, JUST WOW.<br /><br />The secondary characters were just as amazing. Lake's mom & brother. Will's brother. Eddie and Gavin. They all had such amazing personality and I loved each and every one of them.<br /><br />THE POETRY. Now, I am not really a huge fan of poetry. I know and love some of the classics, sure. Poe. Frost. Shakespeare. Blake. Aside from that, I don't really go near poetry. I can appreciate it, but probably not to the extent that it should be appreciated. That being said, the poetry in this book was very moving to me. I have seen slam poetry myself once before (other than in movies, that is) and it was fascinating. I think Colleen Hoover did a really beautiful job of bringing the power of slam poetry into this story. Even in print, it was an incredibly moving experience.<br /><br />The struggles. Everything these characters go through is portrayed so well. Lake and Will's relationship, Lake dealing with her father's death, the imminent death of her mother, knowing she will have to raise her brother, college... just everything. This girl was thrown multiple curve balls and every single emotion she felt, I felt. Everything all the characters felt, I felt. Will, Eddie, the young brothers, and Lake's mother - they all went through things in this story and it was emotional to read. Hoover has a way with words and storytelling that gripped my heart and soul.<br /><br />Slammed is a beautiful and tragic story. It's sad and hopeful. It's passionate and humorous. It made me laugh and it made me cry. It made me feel. It's a fast-paced book that kept me enthralled from cover to cover - literally. I read it in one sitting and I did it easily. The romance is packed with intensity and heat. The characters are multidimensional and FULL of personality. Slammed is so much more than a story of girl meets boy, girl falls in love with boy she can't be with, girl stays with boy anyway. It's more than just drama and angst - it's an inspiring, beautiful, passionate and completely emotional ride. Nothing I say can accurately portray just how incredible this book really is. If you like Young Adult contemporaries, you will LOVE this.gh things in this story and it was emotional to read.

0307730697|5.0|I was interested in this book because I like to read about the military. And I was in the US Navy years ago. I was not prepared for what I read.<br /><br />This autobiography (which I don't tend towards reading) was a beautiful example of both military pride and God's love. Adam's story is filled with defeat, humiliation, huge success, and abundant love.<br /><br />The story of a true child of God that we all want to be. I will not spoil the story by stating specifics (you really need to read it), but Adam's life started \\"normal\\", swerved to the \\"unacceptable\\", progressed through \\"astounding\\", and ended up in \\"Glory\\".<br /><br />This very human, American story is not written in typical autobiographical format. It is not boring. It is easy reading, more like a novel format, or like watching a movie on the pages :) It is written very well. Real. Emotional. Funny. Understanding. It will grab you, shake you up a bit, and then encourage and inspire you to be a better person.<br /><br />If you like true life as well as military stories, this is the book for you. Eric Blehm (author) did a superior job expressing the honest, authentic life of a true hero.<br /><br />Adam Brown: child of God, husband, father, son, US Navy Seal, friend and HERO.  Thank you for your service and humanity. I can't wait to meet you on the other side.<br /><br />Heart felt \\"Thank You's\\" and prayers to Adam Brown's family and friends for allowing his story to be told.<br /><br />5 stars is not enough. Read it to see why.<br /><br />*This book was provided at no cost for review. I was not required to write a positive review. The opinions I have expressed are my own.
B007IE4DSG|5.0|Imagine sitting in a small room with George Harrison.  Imagine leaning against a soundproof wall inside a studio while George is recording.  When he creates a particularly delicious riff or nails a vocal, George looks over at you and smiles.  That's what listening to this CD is like.  Gorgeous music and gorgeous intimacy.  Thank God it's titled \\"Volume 1\\"--if there's a God, there'll be at least 11 more volumes.
1440503257|5.0|After exploring the book and testing what recipes I could, I feel that it is safe to say this book will be held in the same esteem as the rest of my cookbooks.  More than being full Harry Potter, this is a good all-around cookbook with a wide variety of recipes--deserts, full meals, etc.  Though it's clear the Harry Potter theme is made to fit these, one can't complain about the collection of recipes itself.  As for the Harry Potter feel, it simply makes this book more fun than not and gives it such an old-school witchy look that's beautiful.
B007JM4CWY|2.0|I know it's probably just me that doesn't get this. Right now I feel like I wasted my time downloading this. Looking on the bright side, good thing I didn&rsquo;t spend any money for it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Some how this book touched me in a way I didn't know a book could. It was fantastic. I don't think it has a genre because it has aspects of every single genre. I love it so much! I re-read it after I finished it the first time. I've never re read a book. Thank you John Green for this wonderful book. I will never forget it.Gush Gush LOL.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I really liked this book but I did not particually like the ending until I relized who lived. Best Buy ever worth the money

0345803507|3.0|A visit to the dentist is surely in order once you've reached the happily ever after of this sugary sweet fairy tale. As predictable as the tides the conclusion of this story finds Anna and Christian living the impossible dream of wealth, happiness beyond belief and children, turning them into the \\"perfect\\" family. We can only assume that the children grow up go to the best colleges are impossibly successful, marry flawless lifelong mates and give Mr. and Mrs. Grey the paradisiacal golden years worthy of God himself. There of course is the issue concerning \\"Jack Hyde\\" that is not only swiftly resolved with no adverse effects but is the only excitement offered in this book. Once that has played out with impeccable results what you're left with is the inhuman perfection that is Anna and Christian Grey.<br /><br />The metamorphosis of these characters has made little if any stride since the beginning of the first book but by the end of the story Anna has managed to do in less than a year what a life time of professional therapy couldn't do, she cures Christian. Turning him from the callused dominant into the simpering husband and doting father. The amount of painfully touching admissions of undying love between Anna and Christian would make even cupid roll his eyes.<br /><br />Anna is still questioning herself at every turn and even when it looks like she will finally put her foot down her steely resolve crumbles when confronting Christian. They are both so wishy washy.<br /><br />A constant frustration throughout is the fact that only a psychology major would undertake a relationship with the mercurial Mr. Grey. No one in their right mind would subject themselves to the constant whiplash effect of Mr. Grey's personality. Navigating through the muck of absent or underdeveloped mental faculties as well as all the overly abundant psychological deformities that is Mr. Grey would be the most exhausting of rollercoaster rides that most people would want to stop and get offof sooner rather than later.  Anna's uncertainty of every action taken and word spoken with regard to Mr. Grey would drive a sane person mad. Their all too frequent sexual interludes are the only time they seem to be on the same page emotionally and psychologically. Every single encounter between the two ends with the kind of lustful fornication that Kama himself would put a stamp of approval on. There's not one issue they deal with that gets resolved because they are forever defaulting to sex. It doesn't help that Christian had brought out the insatiable nymphomaniac in Anna. It seems she is the only person on the planet who has absolutely no self control sexually and whose body is as sensitive the leaflets on a Mimosa.<br /><br />After the few brief bits of excitement all that's left is the day to day life of the unbelievably lucky, average girl who manages to marry (mental issues not withstanding) the rich, more than gorgeous, dominant yet sensitive, caring, eyes only for her, expert lover guy every girl wants, all their non-stop sex and Anna's four hour orgasms in all its panting, teary eyed detail. And for those of you who want a small look into the pre-Anna Christian Grey, the end of the book sheds a flicker of light.

1401234542|4.0|Like Batman, Green Lantern continuity didn't change a whole lot with DC's New 52 epic relaunch, and honestly that's a good thing here.  After spending the past 8 years working on Green Lantern, bringing Hal Jordan back from the dead, and placing the character right smack-dab between Batman and Superman as DC's most prominent heroes, superhero writer extraordinaire Geoff Johns is here in the driver's seat spinning a new saga for the Green Lanterns.  After the War of the Green Lanterns, Hal Jordan no longer wears the ring, and now his one-time arch nemesis Sinestro is a Green Lantern once again.  What develops is Sinestro and Hal winding up having to team up for a greater good, which helps make for some great storytelling here.  What's disappointing though is that for super-new readers, Green Lantern somehow manages to still come off as frequently convoluted.  That's the nature of the beast though, as Johns has crafted so many finely-tuned and interconnecting Green Lantern stories over the years that it's just come to be expected at this point.  Still though, it's plenty enjoyable regardless, and artist Doug Mahnke provides some of his best artwork to date.  All in all, it's a new era for Green Lantern, and readers new and old will enjoy what they find here.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am a mother of 4 (4 and under) who has lost over 20 lbs. by doing this DVD.  Granted, I have a lot to lose which makes it somewhat easier for me to drop the pounds, but have found fast and lasting results with this type of workout.  Granted, some of the moves (beginning or otherwise) are challenging, but not impossible!  Some people have complained about knee pain, etc., but as a person who started doing this at a fairly high weight, I have experienced no real discomfort beyond Level 1 and even then it was minor.  Should you exercise caution?  Absolutely, but I would stress that regardless of what form of exercise you opted to try or what type of workout.  My advice would be to take your time with the moves, feel them out.  Don't be afraid to stop the tape the first couple times and try repositioning, or moving through the move more slowly to get a feel for what's right for you and your body.  When I read the negative reviews and what people complained about, many acted as if they couldn't stop the tape to break it down, etc.  You do have control and should take the time to do just that, it's well worth it so that the results and workout are most effective.<br /><br />I do agree that the five minute opening is a tad ridiculous, but I've also found that marching during that time for a longer warm up, or using that time to lace up sneaks and get water, a towel, or my mat has also proven to be beneficial, rather than standing there staring at it and fuming.<br /><br />Bottom line, for me, it's the results that counts with this DVD, not my personal opinion about Jillian (although there were days I hated her), not the 5-6 minute intro, or anything else. Just the fact that I've lost almost 30 lbs by eating right and completing this workout in the last month and a half and am still going strong.  Started a new Jillian Michaels DVD this week and hope to have similar results.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a really well done Picross/Nonagram game. A few things I like: Big puzzles; numbers cross themselves out as you solve sections of the puzzle; completed puzzles are displayed like a gallery on the menu. My only complaint is that the boxes can be pretty small, so it's hard to touch what you're aiming for. You can zoom in to alleviate that, but then you have to scroll the puzzle around a lot. I guess there's really no way around that, due to the small screen size of a phone.<br /><br />I highly recommend this game!
0307352145|4.0|As an Introvert I absolutely loved the title of this book! As an introvert, I have heard all the stereotypes, and felt the push to be more outgoing, and felt the pressures of living in an extroverted world. Cain points out through the first few chapters that being 'quiet' is not a negative, that being an introvert is not a bad thing, introverts simply approach problems and life from a different perspective.<br /><br />Cain approaches this book from a scientific perspective and uses many sources and surveys as well as personal experiences  to back what she is saying. Cain continues throughout the book to remind us of introverts throughout history who have made a difference and has made a powerful impact in the world. This book is research based and focuses primarily on introverts and how they are succeeding in an extroverted world. Cain offers advice for introverts, but it can be advice for anyone.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone to read, especially for those self-proclaimed introverts, this book will open your eyes and help you to realize and understand some of your thought processes as an introvert and why you may feel uncomfortable in certain circumstances.<br />I received this book complimentary from Waterbrook Multnomah through the Blogging for Books program in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
0345803485|5.0|I have to preface this by saying that I got the first and second book of this series 5 days ago and I have devoured both already. Yes there is a LOT of sex...and VERY graphic in the description. Yes there are mentions of things that you may (or may not) have ever heard about. It can make even the most experienced of people blush a bit. But what I liked more than anything was the playful banter between the two main characters. It is refreshing in the sense that relationships really are similar to this hot/cold, up/down, fight/make-up kind of situation. In reality, it may not be the relationship that lasts, but we have ALL had some version of a relationship like this (be honest...you know you have LOL).<br /><br />So I personally say believe the hype....it's not just for mothers...it's for anyone who likes to read a good love story...even ones with a bit of kinky to them. I'm speaking as a person who loves to read but has, as of late, found myself getting lost in the humdrum of watching tv. But it was this book that was the first, in a very long time, that had me dying to see what happens next. I just finished the second book tonight and am gonna wait until the weekend to start the third book so I won't be disturbed when I'm reading :-) So you can check the book out and figure out you like it or you can check it out and figure out that you don't...but either way, you will know the story of Christian and Ana so the author wins either way :-)
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|Wow what an incredible movie. Well written and directed by Madonna, of course. Great period piece Arianne Phillips nailed the costuming for this breathtaking movie. It's actually two stories entrtwined together. Absolutely brilliant movie about true love and what someone will do for that love.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Great puzzle game. Just like picross I used to play for hours. Unfortunately can only give 4 stars because of constant requirement of multi tapping. Please update to add/allow highlight dragging to just swipe your finger across desired squares.  Either a button on the side to enable or just implement in controls. When that happens..5 stars!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you like to read pornographic material this the book for you! I do not. I should have read the reviews before I down loaded the book on my Kindle. I did not enjoy the book at all. I had to delete the book and forget about my money I threw away. Oh, and go take a cold shower!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Awesome game and well worth any amount. It has challenges, yet simple concept that make it very addicting. I would love to see more from these guys.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I'm not sure why people are saying you can't drag across to select a bunch of squares. You just have to hold it first! It even tells you how many you've selected.<br /><br />I've never played Picross,  so this is new to me and I really like it. The tutorial could be a lot better, but I'm having fun figuring it out.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Ian doing a follow up to TAAB?  Crazy!  I even held off buying it for a couple of months.  As a huge Tull fan, I was petrified of being disappointed.<br /><br />By the third track, I couldn't believe Ian had done it again.  After years of pining for new music, unsuccessfully, here was something fresh yet rooted in the past.  Recorded with the care only a 70's artist can provide, lush with 21st century fourishes, and with great care provided Ian's ailing voice (not that you'd know it here), the ablum is gorgeous on every level.<br /><br />Using a lot of the motives and themes from TAAB, he nonetheless creates something unique and original.  A fine coda to a wonderful career, and finally, no one can say he gave up making new music in 1991.<br /><br />What's next?  Passon Play II?  Songs from the Meadow?  Heavy People?  Who knows what's yet to come from the ever active Mr. Anderson.
B000GOWNPU|5.0|The cinematography and acting are just amazing!  While the plot itself is a grim topic, the story line weaves in and out so smoothly.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I like this game and it is fun to play.  It is a nice puzzle game that can be a real mind challenger.  I have enjoyed playing it since I downloaded it.  I do find it hard to play and the tutorial was not very elaborate and could be expanded on.  I have very large hands and these puzzles get difficult to fill out quickly and more and more squares are added.  I am using a Kindle Fire which has a fairly large screen and I am still having problems.  I have to zoom and pinch just to fill in a square which slows down the game play a lot.<br /><br />I thought the tutorial was weak when after two simple puzzles it jumps to a 10 X10 matrix and gets harder from there on.  It would be nice for us first time players to have gotten a few more hints at the strategy.  Overall though this is a good game and I will work until I can master it.  I like games that are a mental challenge to play.
1905492073|5.0|This is a great book for anyone wishing to understand the theory of decompression diving, mixed gas theory, and the physiologic basis of decompression illnesses.  I would recommend it more for the advanced student or someone considering rebreather or mixed gas technical diving.  I believe it's a must read for anyone teaching students at the instructor level or above.  It reads more like a college physiology or science text,  but that is necessary in order to impart the information it needs to.  The book is well organized, concise, and very clear.  The author has done a nice job in taking a complex subject and make it very understandable without \\"dummying it down.\\"
B008KEQMDC|3.0|I understand this movie is inspired by the best-selling pregnancy book, but it's very different. The book itself is only shown twice in the whole movie. There were some cute funny moments, and sad heart-breaking moments. My favorite performance was Elizabeth Banks as Wendy. Her portrayal seemed the most accurate. Anna Kendrick as Rosie was pretty depressing. Jennifer Lopez as Holly was tender-hearted. She is unable to conceive and adopts an Ethiopian child. Cameron Diaz as Jules was nothing too special. She is a celebrity host of a weight-loss show. Holly's husband, Alex isn't sure if he's ready to become a parent, so they send him to the Dude's Group. If you like romantic comedies and baby stories, you might enjoy WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN YOU'RE EXPECTING!!!
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I love gem swap match 3 games! This game satisfies that love! Only gave it 4 stars b/c would love for it to have a random mini game thrown in like maybe a hidden treasure game or something along those lines. Im not very far in the game tho so maybe it does have something and i just havent gotten that far! highly recommended for match 3 fans!
B006Y5BWQG|5.0|After reading other reviews, I wasn't sure if I needed to write one. I agree that it is the \\"best show on TV\\", and I also agreed with \\"couldn't wait to see the show every week\\". We have satelite I could watch the show both on Monday and on Friday, but that was still not enough to give me my \\"SMASH fix\\". And I was sooooooooooooooo happy when I heard that they were going for a 2nd season. I hope that they keep all of the characters. They are very dramatic and interact so well together. My question is: When will season 1 be up for sale!?!?!?
0345803485|5.0|Well I love love these books , finished number one , left me hanging , finished two and Im starting on three now.<br />The story is fabulous, eye opening, and romantic.<br />If you're a stuffy, snooty, uptight about sex - Don't read this and give it a bad review !<br />If you're open minded , even a tiny bit on the wild goddess side - you'll love it !<br />The book states \\"Erotic Romance\\" .....and it is !!!  So don't read it if you don't like that sort of thing.<br />Thank you E.L. James !!! Keep them coming ......
B006LR0XLM|5.0|i downloaded this to my cell phone, my laptop, and both desktops so i never have to email myself a photo or document again if i want to have it accessible!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a good game if you like to play solitaire.  I like the various options for deals.  You can get a random deal, a winning deal, or replay the last deal.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|I would just like to say 'thank you' to all the haters. I had very low expectations because of all the negative reviews, but this movie was a non-stop action extravaganza. It has very little to do with the classic board game, but that doesn't take away from the fun. This is truly a summer blockbuster. Alex Hopper is the lazy slacker brother of  Commander Stone Hopper. When Alex gets arrested, trying to impress the daughter of Admiral Shane, Stone makes him join the United States Navy. Seven years later, Alex is still a slacker but he must step up his game during the  RIMPAC naval exercises. During the same time, five alien spaceships crash land in the sea. They begin to attacks the ships. Alex is forced to become the leader and fight back against the aliens. Like I said, this film is extremely action-packed and worthy of a viewing. I highly recommend BATTLESHIP!!!

B007C3TVNA|1.0|Saw this movie on on demand and was so very disappointed. The book was great. I think maybe it is the kind of story that does not easily convert to the movies because there is alot of thoughts in the book. I am just glad I only paid $4.95 and diden't buy the dvd. The movie did not do the book justice.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I called Amazon on Monday about my kindle charger cord fraying to where you could see the wiring.  I was hoping that it would be covered under my extended warranty.  I didn't think it was and of course it wasn't.  The rep., I spoke to was very kind.  He sent me a new cord for free!  I couldn't be more happier with this!  Now, I'm just waiting, since my kindle is now dead and waiting to be recharged!  Thanks customer service!
0345803485|5.0|This is quite the journey.  Get ready to be so obsessed that sleep is no longer important.  This is by far my favorite book...EVER.  Yes, it has some very naughty parts so don't let you kids read it but for adults who love enticing, complicated and lustful stories this book is for you. Please write more books EL James and fast!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Worked just fine on my G2. Then I got the One S and every time I start playing it crashes. You will get 5 stars when I can play again.

B004N66XYE|1.0|It is to bad they cannot leave a great thing alone.  The story line is weak and the charters are flat.  Rose still being a maid at +75  is a sad case. BBC should be ashamed.  The 1970's Upstairs Downstairs is great TV buy the DVD and let it rest in peace.
B001LXIDVS|5.0|Let me start off by saying this is a amazing movie! It is a great ending to the series and makes you want more Back to the Future movies. As for video quality, it is really good. I received the dvd in the mail with no scratches bumps or anything. I could tell it was mint condition. I could not be happier.
0345803485|5.0|Before I praised the beautifully crafted words of E.L. James, I must first tell, you reader, my sad life before this wonderful book touched the depths of my soul. I grew up in North America to liberal parents, who always taught me to be independent. My mother, who wasted her life as the CEO of a building company and leader of her local feminist club, always preached to me how I needed to be self-reliant and that it was the only path to freedom. I can only assume that my mother was brainwashed by my brute of a father, who always cooked and bring her dinner on her late nights and always praised her in her efforts for better equality for women everywhere. But, since I was a child, I did not know better, so I followed her words and went on the path of freedom. Little did I know that the path of freedom was a path into the dark depths of hell. I went to Harvard at 14 years of age, being the first female ever to be admitted to Harvard at such a young age. I graduated at the age of 20, with a PHD in literature. I began to teach at Harvard, enriching students in my knowledge of lost feminist writings of 5th century Britain. I married at 25 to a brilliant scientist, who quit his career to help raised our two daughters we had a year later. My life would seem ideal to many, but it was far from it. My husband brutalize me by cooking meals for me and my daughters every night, helping my children with their school work, and, at times, tried to romance me into bed, with flowers and \\"I love you's.\\" My professional life was no better. Winning awards, having my research papers of feminist writings in the dead Latin language published was more than I can bear. My life was in utter despair, only made more so whenever I looked at my daughters, knowing that this despair awaited their future. One night, after work, my husband called me and asked (I almost vomited at his, \\"If it is not too much trouble dear; I know how tired you are) if I would go by the bookstore and pick up \\"Goodnight Moon\\" for our youngest daughter's book project. I said yes, not knowing that my life would drastically change. As I enter the bright lights of the bookstore, there display before me was the E. L. James' novel: Fifty Shades of Grey. With the book carefully bathed in the fluorescent heavenly light, I could not resist it's aura. Forgetting my original purpose, I bought the book and immediately took to my car to read it. There, my life changed. E. L. James' writing was unlike anything I have ever read. Her writing lacked the pretentious manner of proper grammar; what a rebel, I thought. But the character of Christen Grey, oh, I came at the very mention of him on every page. He was so unlike any man in my life. He was not a brute like my father or husband. Here was a man, who actually forced his love to have sex with him in the most creative of ways. I felt envious, my husband would never tie me or have violent sex with me, instead, he would only kiss me and make slow love (torture for me) to me with romantic music. But it wasn't just the sex that made me fell in love with Christian Grey. E. L. James showed me a whole new world as to what my life could be. Instead of working hard and making my own decisions, I could have a gorgeous, rich man who could force me into a life of sex and who could make decisions for me. Let me tell you, I nearly bawl my eyes out when he forced Anastasia to work out so she would not gain weight: I learned then what love truly is. Now, I am divorced from my brutal husband and met a new man on suggardaddy.com and he treats me and my daughters well. He forced me to quit my job, have plastic surgery and sex me up every night. Believe me; I have the bruises and scars to prove it. As for my daughters, they still missed their father, even though my new man practically hugs and caress my daughters every day, but I know that I am now providing a better life and future for them. The Gods themselves could have not written a better book! I am so happy thatso many women everywhere are now realizing that we had the path to happiness all along. And may women like Susan B Anthony and Gloria Steinem go rot in the hell that they created for women everywhere!
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is such a fabulous movie. Christina did an excellent job with her singing and dancing. The story is a good one and not hard to follow.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was great couldn't put it down. I would recommend to any one who loves a dirty romance.  It was the first book that after I read I waited about five days and started reading it again.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|This book greatly aided in my formatting my book for kindle production. An absolute must have for any writer striving to get his literature public!
B004MC8CA2|1.0|This is a terrific app for on the go Bible study. It helps when you are in a place where you can't open your regular print Bible. Great resources for study too.
B007MAETA8|5.0|If I could describe this album in one sentiment, I would say mature. John takes the concept of being \\"Born and Raised\\" as a rite of passage - having gone through the tough times and made it through, a little battered, a little older, but better for all of it.<br /><br />And all at once it gets hard to take<br />It gets hard to fake what I won't be<br />Cause one of these days I'll be born and raised<br />...<br />Born and raised<br />Locks of brown and streaks of gray<br />I was brought up in brighter days<br />It's good to say<br />Now I'm born and raised<br /><br />Maybe that's why I like it - maybe I too am growing up. I love the old times - the Room for Squares, the Heavier Things, the Continuum - they'll always have a special place in my collection. But Born and Raised is me, right now, and I appreciate that.<br /><br />Musically, this is a departure, but for the better. It is much less pop, and much more raw and minimal (dare I even say, country?). It's organic, it's real, heck it even has a harmonica. Sadly the blues are pretty much gone here, but at least what we're left with works - it really really works.<br /><br />Is this his best album? That's a tough one - I think only time will tell. Continuum will always be a hard act to follow. And we won't mention Battle Studies - hey, we all make mistakes.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I really enjoy this app. Do wish tiles were bigger but that adds more of a challenge!  would like to see more variations to game.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This is one of the greatest movies of all time. There are sad times, hard times, great time and such a wonderful horse. Give it a try.
0375842209|4.0|Set in WWII Germany and written from the perspective of Death, The Book Thief is a touching story about an orphaned girl named Liesel Meminger with an insatiable hunger for words. After being taught to read by her foster father, Hans Hubermann, Liesel begins acquiring books by any means necessary, legal or not. The other main characters are:<br /> - Rosa Hubermann<br /> - Death<br /> - Rudy Steiner<br /> - Max Vandenberg<br /> - Ilsa Herman<br /> This story paints a very personal and realistic picture of the struggles and devastation of war. The tone of this book is generally somber with bits of action and excitment thrown in sporadically. This book would fall into the genres of War Drama, Coming of Age, and Historical Fiction. This book is intended for young adults. This book contains many major themes such as:<br />  - Words and Propaganda<br />  - Thievery<br />  - Humanity and Dehumanization<br />  - Cowardice<br />  - Abandonment and Survivors' Guilt<br />I agreed with all of these themes and I thought they all fit the story very well. I really enjoyed this book. I specifically liked that Death was the narrator and the way the author kept foreshadowing about major events that were yet to come. I thought it kept the book interesting because you now knew what was going to happen but seeing how it got there was very fascinating. I thought Markus Zusak did a very good job writing this book. It is very unique. The only thing that would possibly imrpove the book is if the author went more into detail about Max after he got taken away. It would help us develop a stronger emotional attachment to him. In general, I really enjoyed this book and I plan to re-read it over and over again. I would reccomend this book to anyone.
B007JM4CWY|3.0|The functionality on this is hokey. LogicPicColor offers a better game.  The app is free and there is a few free grids, but for .99c each you can buy game packs with thousands of puzzles. Pack 3 is the best. With CrossMe you get very few puzzles and if I paid for this I'd be very disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Really liked the social commentary inherent to the book while telling a fantastic personal story. Excellent characters, excellent suspense, and coherent narrative. Well transformed into movie as well. Looking forward to the next two books.

B007JM4CWY|5.0|Love this game. Love it, love it, love it! I used to play this type of crossword in book form, but I love it on my phone too. Easy to play but challenging for the mind. Great game! And so happy it's the FAOTD!
0307266303|2.0|It would have been nice had the author made me care about just one of these characters. The author makes them seem like a really annoying bunch of people. Exaggerated and sophomoric writing.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|my kindle started locking up after installing and stopped only after uninstalling so......The prices for gold in this game is crazzy high and even if it didn't lock me up I still would have removed it which is sad because what I could play I really liked.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|Mission impossible movies are typically very smart, action packed, with a good plot. This one seems a little bit too self-aware. It knows it is a mission impossible movie, and instead of sticking with the same old formula, it became a gadget movie. Too many unrealistic high tech devices that played important parts in the story. All-in-all, it is entertaining and worth watching, it just has a few too many wholes.
B005JU5JEI|5.0|i will name the funniest movies ever just so you know this movie is in the top ten.<br />  \\"little shop of horrors,\\"see no evil,hear no evil\\",\\"beavis and butthead do america\\",\\"south park:bigger,longer and uncut\\",\\"jay and silent bob strike back\\",\\"the bad santa\\" and \\"bad teacher\\" i would also put on that list.they arent in order but still \\"bad teacher\\" would rank 7th of all time,comedy wise.everything out of this womans mouth is vulgar. but,we are all adults here,right?<br />  it's about a hot chick who is using her rich boyfriend for his money.he ditches her and so she teaches.she is scoping for a new rich dude she can sponge off of and ends up in a war for this dudes emotions with some other teachers.before you go dismissing this movie as just another romantic comedy,remember she says things that would make a sailor blush and its all hilarious.she has a hard time getting by being as how she is an alcoholic and smokes the stuff.she is motivated only by her desire to get a boob job.this leads to many HOT  scenes,like the student car wash where she dances on cars to when the boob dr lets her see his work on a live subject.<br />  buy it if you want to laugh.just dont watch it with your kids around.i laughed the whole way through this movie.at the end,only 2 things were going through my mind \\"SEQUEL!!!\\" and \\"aw man!i wanted to see her jugs!!\\"
1439153663|5.0|This was an absolute page turner filled with interesting characters that I could care about. Best book I have read in quite some time.
B0007Y89ZM|4.0|I just got a used version of this DVD with DTS-surround sound.  It's unbelievably terrific sound...  so much so, it makes me wonder how much of the show has been polished by some sound engineer or vocals software.  LIVE rock-n-roll just doesn't ever sound this good, especially back in 1994 - all I can say is WOW!  Their other DVD in Melbourne, Australia is the same way - so damn good you'll think it can't be 100% true sound.  This show is also much more laid back than the rockin' \\"Farewell 1 Tour - LIVE from Melbourne\\" DVD.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they didn't rock enough for me (not enough Joe Walsh).  However, the guitarist Don Felder is phenomenal, especially on Hotel California and I Can't Tell You Why.  I also don't understand why they don't put it out in Blu-Ray??  \\"Hotel California\\" and \\"New York Minute\\" are just a couple (of a few) songs on this DVD that have never sounded better to me in any version/format.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|Lurking behind the great and continuous comedy, Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn, helped along with the invaluable James Stuart and companion, portray a valuable lesson about how to relate differently to a spouse than to others -- that there is a difference between being worshiped and being loved.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|Non-linear narratives and hyper-stylized filmmaking seem to be en vogue these days, and unfortunately, they don't always work to a film's advantage. In this case, the director's heavy-handed use of cutaways and jumbled chronology drag down an otherwise brilliant film. (I was reminded, both in methodology and in the use of symbolism, of Lars Von Trier's Antichrist, though mercifully without all the gore.) Tilda Swinton is pitch-perfect as the mother of a young sociopath, and the film wisely refrains from pat judgments or tidy explanations as to whether or not her chilly attitude toward her firstborn affects his descent into evil. For a movie about such horrific events, very little violence is shown on-screen, which makes the climax of the film much more terrifying and effective than a simple bloodbath could have done. All these wisely thought-out decisions make the cumbersome stylistic elements yet more frustrating. This could have been, and should have been, a five star film.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Another awesome album from Joe! There will be life after eric clapton is gone & THE BLUES WILL BE SAVED!!! Joe now besides Warren Haynes may just be the hardest working man in show business. I dont know how he can seperate him self like that. Joe plays one way on his own Then you have Black Country Communion where he is more rock & then has room for side projects with Beth Heart & will jam with anyone from Vince Gill to Paul Rodgers. This Album is a little more back to basics like the BLACK ROCK album. But still mixs this new edge to everything he does. Class act all the way and if you like his other albums this is another that you have to add to the collection. Songs that stand out after first listen are Dislocated Boy' Stones In My Passway then the very melodic & soulful Driving Towards The Daylight.My favorite song so far Heavenly Soul. Then a Slow cool blues style of A Place In My Heart. New Coat Of Paint is the riping blues on fire guitar solo of the album. Joe has been putting out very good music at a very fast rate & all have been great. I just hope that he will not get burt out & keep putting out music with the quality he has.And so far has done very well.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|This office suite is able to handle all my microsoft office documents including all .docx documents, my complicated Excel spreadsheets. Seamlessly opens and updates online and local documents. At a fraction of the cost of the DataViz office suite, while giving up none of the functionality, OfficeSuite Professional 6 is the better buy.<br /><br />The only shortcomings I've found are in the spreadsheet product: it does not autofill when editing a spreadsheet, and it overwrites the first character you type when you begin entering information in a cell.
0439023483|5.0|Many others have probably said the same thing, but really, this is a book that is hard to put down.  I read the book before I saw the movie, and I'm so glad I did it that way.  Both were totally worth the time, and entirely enjoyable.  I ordered the second book, and I'm planning on doing the same thing.
B0079K4WEE|2.0|There are interesting ideas in \\"Sense,\\" and the performances are uniformly excellent, as is everything from the sets to the musical score, but I found it ponderous, pretentious, and ultimately unappealing.  Another reviewer said it's hard to categorize, and that's true, although not necessarily a bad thing.  Pressed to find a category in which to put \\"Sense,\\" I list it with [[ASIN:B000QGAU4E Children of Men]] and [[ASIN:B001LLH8SE Blindness]], which to my mind were both superior films to this one.  I think what \\"Perfect Sense\\" might have been TRYING to be more like is [[ASIN:B004EQAVHI Never Let Me Go]], which is in every way better than \\"Perfect Sense.\\"  If you haven't seen \\"Never Let Me Go\\" yet and have a choice between that and this--do yourself a favor and go with \\"Never.\\"  (But if you're in the mood for sluggish sensuality and diffuse prettiness, you could do much worse than \\"Perfect Sense\\"--if you can stand being merely engaged rather than rapt, it will do.)
B003B02PF4|1.0|I bought this book with very low expectations, since Grisham's work as of lately has not been that good to start with, and even so, this one came as a very unpleasant surprise.<br /><br />I bought it because the sample I got on my kindle (the first couple of chapters) were quite good, but the rest of the book was just boring. 60-70% of this whole thing is reading about the main character's experiences with Italian cuisine, language and culture. Makes you think J.G. took a long trip to Italy and then decided to make a book out of it, which came out as an insipid traveler's blog.<br /><br />And then, in the final chapters, you get the idea that things will finally start rolling again, because 4 or 5 different countries send their top spies/assassins after our hero, but no, nothing happens, not a single shot is fired, no one gets even close to the protagonist, and everyone just goes back home happy.<br /><br />As I said, I have come to not expect much from any of Grishams legal thrillers as of lately, but this one still managed to dissapoint me.<br /><br />Don't buy it, don't read it, don't waste your time on this.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|okay, so you just go to 1mobile.com and download it for free. its so easy. you dont have to pay the 2.99 for this app. you all are stupid. you just waisted 3 dollars. LOL.

B006JJBFK0|5.0|To be honest, before getting this album I used to just \\"like\\" Xandria's music, but with this release they have converted me to a fan! Absolutely amazing vocals, good lyrics and all in all great music with a true feeling of what originally used to be called symphonic metal. It does indeed remind you of the old-school Nightwish in the best possible manner. So, if you are a symphonic metal type of person, this is an album for you! Don't hesitate to buy it, because you will certainly not regret it.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|I rented this movie on google and paid $2.99 for it.  I want my money back.  It was so horrible I didn't even finish watching it.  It was sloppy and all over the place.  Other than the fight scenes, there was no plot or story line.  It was just a hot mess.  Spare yourself the frowns of bewilderment and anger.  You'll never get those precious moment of life back if you watch it, and believe me - you will want that time back.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|I loved this movie.  It held my interest through the entire performance.  The acting was excellent.  Whoever trained this horse or(horses) did a fantastic job because it appeared to be so realistic. I would highly recommend this movie to adults; however, it is not for children.  The war-type violence is too severe for small children.
030788743X|2.0|Maybe it's not my genre but I did not enjoy the book. I am not a huge fan of first person perspective and some authors just can't pull it off. For me Cline falls into that category.<br /><br />It also seemed like a glorified Psych episode with far to many references to the 80's media. The book felt like the author was trying to beat into my head \\"see how witty and smart I am\\" rather than just writing it and trusting the reader to make the connections.
B000A2P0H6|5.0|This album cover was slightly beat, but that only made it more vintage and classic to me. The album itself is in perfect condition-- better than any \\"new\\" vinyls I have purchased. It sounds amazing and I am so happy to have purchased this. I love it! Donovan is amazing.
B007L96VCY|5.0|In late 1987 I recieved a sweet early Xmas present in the form of \\"All the best\\", which unexpectedly helped me a find a long lost song that took me years to rediscover titled \\"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\\" ( the ladder half is what I was looking for).after ward I was trying to collect McCartney's solo work, ( which unfortunatly I could not get into finishing)it was then I discovered the Ram lp, and loved this lp ever since, and it still stays a fresh piece of work to this date. And now finally the album gets it due. Like all the other reviews of this re-release, the remastering is clear and fresh and it's like discovering the album all over again, lots of people on this review are slightly disappointed in no demos on this release, but I am happy with the other bonus tracks on here that are included including the Another Day single with it's b side, and a few unreleased gems to go with it, and if you have downloaded this , also included are two bonus gems exclusivly added for the downloaded version,including a live recording of my favorite track Eat At Home,with Smile Away backed with the track, as well as a Uncle Albert demo, which is catchy.However due to everyone's claim about critics slamming this as well as Lennon's attacks on this release , everyone claims that McCartney went more towards the commercial side of his career, but how does one explain his followup release \\"Wings Wild Life\\" which was even more left field than Ram or even the McCartney release's ? Anyways, for those whose loved this album whether you discovered it when it was first released or later in life, then you will be very pleased with the results of this two cd set edition of RAM.
0345803485|5.0|What a unique story!  I wanted to read these when I first saw them out a while back, but when I saw all the controversy over them I bought them immediately!  This book is soooo good.  The tension and electricity between Christian and Ana is amazing.  I couldn't put this book down and the ending left me wanting more immediately!  I purchased the second book within minutes of finishing the first and Im half way through it now and already ordered Fifty shades freed!  While this book may not be for everyone, stuff like this can happen, and I'm throuroughly enjoying reading about it! Love it! Buy it, read it!
140053271X|5.0|I have had my nook for about 5 months now after getting it for this past christmas. So far it has been PERFECT!!! I am glad I chose it over the kindle. I have not had the screen freeze thing thats been happening. I see some people have had it though. But anyway the keyboard works well and is surprisingly responsive, the page turns are perfect (definitely faster than it would take you to turn the page in a real book) and the layout is beautiful and clean and also simple to navigate. Im still finding new things that my nook simple touch can do! The Barnes and noble store built into the nook simple touch is pretty good, and should suit the full needs of most people. The memory is great with 236 mb of internal memory and the ability to upgrade to atleast 16 gigs maybe even 32 gigs im not sure of that though. But trust me I have 145 full books(and a few wallpapers) on my nook and I havent even gotten through  half of the 236mb internal memory let alone the 4 gig micro-sd card I bought for it so dont let the small memory size fool you as book files are TINY! The nook does exactly what its designed to do, (which is be an ereader), perfectly! The browser is pointless and has been removed with the most recent update but trust me, you arent going to miss the browser as it was slow and annoying anyway. If you are looking for an ereader with a great browser, mp3 and mp4 capabilities,than the nook Simple Touch is NOT for you (get the nook Color or Nook Tablet). If you want a great ereader with no real flaws, the latest in ereader technology, an extraordinary battery life, and an easy to use interface than this is the ereader to get.<br /><br />I was stuck between the kindle touch and a nook simple touch but I chose the nook because it displays books better (has pictures and the actual book covers instead of just the title in words) and the Touch screen is a lot more responsive on the Nook Simple Touch than on the kindle touch. Also the buttons on the side that can be used to turn the page (if you dont wanna touch the screen) on the Nook Simple Touch are great and come in handy! And personally the nook simple touch just FEELS better as in the navigation is faster and more smooth than the kindle touch which seemed to take longer and be a lot more \\"Blinky\\" on the kindle touch. I felt a greater delay between me touching the screen and the Kindle reacting than with the Nook Simple Touch. The only downside is that the B&N bookstore is not as large as Amazons (its huge, but Amazons is immense), but even so I have still been able to find all the books by my favorite authors on the B&N bookstore.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great, clear screen trhat allows you to read for hours<br />-Very responsive touchscreen and touch keyboard (you will be pleasently surprised!)<br />-Great battery life (Literally can go 1 to 1 1/2 month without charging with wifi off and leaving it in \\"sleep\\" mode as far as I have seen with mine)<br />-Easy to use with a simple, efficient, elegant design<br />-The ability to upgrade the memory to a larger size<br />-Tons of options and ways to change the fonts, text size, highlight, write notes, look up words, layout settings, and other customizations to make reading easier for YOU!<br />-Light, small design with a rubber gripped back so it is portable and wont slip from your hands<br />-Supports basically all the major types of book file types like EPUB (which the kindle doesnt)<br />-Elegant cosmetic design that doesnt look cheap and flimsy like most other ereaders<br /><br />Cons:<br />-B&N bookstore is not as great as Amazons<br />-May freeze occasionally when you turn it all the way off (this has never happened to mine though, but I've seen it mentioned quite a few times but seems to be easily fixable with no permanent damage)<br />-Wish it had a built in backlight (the new nook simple touch does) but Im not buying a newer more expensive nook just for a backlight!!! Just buy a booklight on amazon.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book is amazing. It has to be the most fun book I've read since Hitchhikers Guide. Any geeks who grew up in the 80's or early 90's, or for that matter is a geek in general should read this book because, you will LOVE it. It's an amazing ride with a interesting set of characters in the most amazing world I\\"ve had the pleasure to be in since the dark tower.
